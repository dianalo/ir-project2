The Environmental Defense Fund says that while the governmentpushes cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill, little attention is beingpaid to damage and danger from the Bahia Paraiso, which liesoverturned a mile from the U.S. scientific outpost at PalmerStation, Antarctica.   Fund lawyer Bruce Manheim, in a letter Thursday to Skinner, saidthe Bahia Paraiso ran aground Jan. 28, spilling 170,000 gallons ofdiesel fuel. But 70,000 gallons remain, posing a hazard because thewreck could be crushed by severe ice conditions which are expectedwith the onset of the Antarctic winter this month, he said.   Manheim urged Skinner to determine the likely fate of fuel stillaboard the vessel, contact Argentine authorities to determine ifthey plan further action and ``implement measures to eliminatefurther pollution from the ship if a grave or imminent threat ofpollution exists.''   Manheim said that while the Exxon Valdez spill of 11 milliongallons of crude oil on March 24 into Alaska's Prince William Soundhas produced a massive cleanup effort, Argentina ``has essentiallywalked away'' from the Bahia Paraiso shipwreck.   He asked Skinner to consider acting under internationalagreements that Manheim said would allow the United States toprotect marine life and U.S. scientific interests on the icycontinent.   Transportation Department spokesman Bob Marx said Skinner'soffice had received the letter but would have no comment until itcould be reviewed.   ``We'll see what action we could take,'' said Marx.   Manheim said the spill has killed seals, penguins and otherAntarctic marine life and has destroyed important U.S. studies onthe effects of ozone depletion.   ``Antarctica's worst environmental disaster has become aforgotten oil spill,'' he said. ``The situation is bound to getworse.''   The Environmental Defense Fund describes itself as a non-profitorganization of scientists, economists, lawyers and othersinterested in finding economically viable solutions toenvironmental problems.</TEXT></DOC>
