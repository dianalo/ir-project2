But the right wing began to feel a lot better recently when Mr. Baker asked T. Kenneth Cribb Jr. to join his new team as assistant to the president for domestic affairs.    Mr. Cribb's appointment meant little to many in Washington who know him only as an affable sidekick to Attorney General Edwin Meese. But his appointment gave conservatives cause to rejoice.    &quot;We love him,&quot; declares Mr. Viguerie. Former White House aide Patrick Buchanan, another admirer, says, &quot;Ken Cribb's got the mentality of a bureaucrat, but the heart of a bombthrower.&quot; Meanwhile, liberal activist Anthony Podesta of People for the American Way complains that Mr. Cribb's promotion from the Justice Department &quot;is like transferring Rasputin from the Ministry of Justice to the prime minister's office.&quot;    In his new job, Mr. Cribb will oversee most of the domestic policy-making apparatus in the White House, including the offices of policy development, cabinet affairs and public liaison, and the welfare-revision proposal President Reagan sent to Congress last winter.    Mr. Cribb's hard-line conservative views, especially on civil rights, seem in direct conflict with more moderate positions of the White House staff led by Mr. Baker and his deputy, Kenneth Duberstein. Some believe Mr. Cribb was named merely as a sop to the right wing. But those who know him well, like White House Political Director Frank Donatelli, warn against underestimating him.    &quot;Ken's not going to be just window dressing,&quot; says Mr. Donatelli. &quot;He knows what he wants and how to get it.&quot;    Over the next month, in consultation with Cabinet officers and others, Mr. Cribb plans to draw up a &quot;supple strategic plan&quot; for presidential action to promote such issues as the Strategic Defense Initiative, a balanced-budget amendment, no new taxes, more conservative judges, and what he calls the &quot;moral issues,&quot; like school prayer and opposition to abortion.    Despite such a high-profile agenda, Mr. Cribb has generally been more comfortable working behind closed doors -- first on the White House staff with Mr. Meese, then for the past two years as counselor to the attorney general. But he has been a strong force behind the Reagan administration's opposition to abortion, affirmative action, and the reading of the Miranda warning to criminal suspects.    Many of his views, say his friends, were formed during his upbringing as the son of a prominent Spartanburg, S.C., family of peach growers, whose roots stretch back before the American Revolution. Mr. Cribb, 38 years old, was trained as a lawyer at the University of Virginia, and read widely in the literature of conservative political philosophy.    The searing conflicts of his generation seem to have had little effect on him. He was untouched personally by the Vietnam War; he says he thought it was &quot;proper to prosecute the war more aggressively,&quot; but he obtained a student deferment. And although he matured during the era of racial upheaval in the South -- his high school was ordered to desegregate -- he says the civil rights movement &quot;had no impact on me.&quot;    In the White House, Mr. Cribb was an active supporter of Mr. Meese's abortive effort to extend tax-exempt status to the segregated Bob Jones University. He also opposed aspects of the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, urging that the law should only outlaw election practices where an intent to discriminate could be proven, a legal standard experts say is difficult to meet. Mr. Reagan ultimately signed a broader extension.    At the Justice Department, Mr. Cribb developed a reputation for applying ideological tests in the selection of potential judges. One candidate he pushed was Lino Graglia, a former law-school professor of his who was considered for a place on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. But Mr. Graglia's name was never submitted to Congress, partly because of his statements suggesting that citizens were under &quot;no obligation&quot; to obey court-ordered busing, as well as his classroom reference to blacks as &quot;pickaninnies.&quot;    Mr. Cribb says he himself believes that &quot;the policy of forced busing is a flawed one, but obviously, people should obey court orders,&quot; and says that he didn't know about the &quot;pickaninny&quot; remark when he put forward Mr. Graglia's name. &quot;Any kind of racial slur is offensive to me,&quot; he says.    Mr. Cribb also has unsuccessfully pushed for the appointment of Melvin Bradford, a controversial University of Dallas English professor, to head the National Endowment for the Humanities and, later, to be U.S. archivist. Mr. Bradford has drawn criticism for characterizing Abraham Lincoln as a &quot;demagogue on the issue of slavery.&quot; Mr. Cribb says that &quot;I've never read his stuff on Lincoln,&quot; but says that Mr. Bradford has &quot;an encyclopedic grasp of the era of the founding of our country.&quot; Mr. Bradford, in turn, declares: &quot;Ken and I are old friends. . . . We're both Southerners, and unembarrassed by Southern traditions.&quot;    Such controversies have earned Mr. Cribb some detractors within the administration who suggest behind his back that he is insensitive on racial issues. Mr. Cribb dismisses such complaints as &quot;sniggering haughtiness at my accent.&quot;    Throughout his government career, Mr. Cribb has benefited significantly from the patronage of Mr. Meese, who describes him as &quot;an extension of me.&quot; In one episode that has raised eyebrows, Mr. Meese gave him six weeks of paid leave time from his $72,300-a-year Justice Department job to study for the bar exam in the summer of 1985. Such a step is highly unusual.    &quot;There's no such thing as paid leave to study for the bar. That's unheard of,&quot; says Jeffrey Miller, deputy attorney general for personnel and administration; Donald Winstead, chief of the Office of Personnel Management's pay administration division, says that in a nonbinding ruling on a similar case, the comptroller general found such leave was &quot;inappropriate.&quot; After an inquiry from this newspaper, the Office of Government Ethics says it is looking into the matter.    But Mr. Meese's spokesman, Terry Eastland, says the department's guidelines do allow for paid time off at the discretion of the supervisor -- in this case, Mr. Meese -- when it is in the interests of either the government or the public.    Despite Mr. Cribb's close links to Mr. Meese and other hard-line conservatives, those who know him believe he will be able to survive inside the new, more moderate White House. &quot;Ken knows how to wrap a conservative punch in a velvet glove,&quot; says one admirer, James B. Taylor, executive director of the Young America's Foundation.    And Mr. Meese points out that his protege even knows how to compromise with the moderates when necessary. The attorney general observes that, these days, Mr. Cribb refers to the Civil War as the War Between the States; before joining the government, Mr. Meese chuckles, &quot;Ken told me he called it the War of Northern Aggression.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
