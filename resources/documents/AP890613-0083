(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A rash of accidental shootings ofchildren by children is being blamed on Florida's liberal gun lawand is renewing a push for legislation against leaving guns withinreach of a youngster.   Five shootings since June 1 involving children playing with gunsat home have left two youngsters dead and one near death today.   Gov. Bob Martinez on Monday said he will consider adding gunlegislation to the agenda of a special summer session he wants tocall on transportation matters.   ``There's been a series of tragic accidents here that has thepeople of Florida very concerned,'' said Martinez.   Under a bill proposed earlier this month by Rep. Harry Jennings,leaving a firearm in reach of a child would be a misdemeanor. Itwould be a felony carrying up to five years in prison if a childdied or was maimed.   The bill, which borrows language from the state'sabandoned-refrigerator law, would require that guns be secured witha trigger lock or kept in a locked container.   A spokeswoman for the Rifle Association said the group would notoppose the bill if were amended to exclude shootings involving gunsstolen from a home, but she said the law would be superfluous.   ``We have laws on our books now that deal with childendangerment, negligence, culpable negligence and criminalnegligence and there is recourse in the civil courts,'' said MarionHammer.   Jennings said much of the problem results from Florida's 1987 gunlaw, which all but eliminated cooling-off periods for purchases,banned local gun-control ordinances and allowed most Floridians tocarry a concealed weapon.   Jennings' measure passed in the House during the recentlycompleted regular session, but the Senate didn't take it up. OnMonday, Senate President Bob Crawford said he would like to see thebill included in a special session.   ``Anything that would encourage the family to be more aware ofthe dangers of leaving loaded guns in that setting ... I'd bewilling to work with you on that,'' he said.   Some lawmakers expressed reservations.   ``You can't legislate against all tragedy,'' said Rep. LoisFrankel. ``Why would the threat of going to jail be any more adeterrent to carelessness than having your child killed?''   The latest shooting victim, 4-year-old Silvio Pierre, was listedin very critical condition today at Tampa General Hospital. He hadfound his father's .25-caliber pistol under a living room chairSunday, police said.   No statewide statistics on such accidents are kept, said LindaBooz, information specialist for the Florida Department of LawEnforcement.</TEXT></DOC>
