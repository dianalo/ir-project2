The Rev. Ed Dobson and Ed Hindson, who each spent more than adecade leading evangelicals out of the political closet asarchitects of the Moral Majority, contend in a new book thatreligious conservatives are searching for new leadership.   ``I think the vast majority of fundamentalists ... are kind ofin neutral,'' said Dobson, once considered the successor to JerryFalwell's evangelistic empire.   With Falwell announcing his withdrawal from politics and PatRobertson's unsuccessful presidential candidacy, Dobson said,``There is no charismatic person to put it together.''   Dobson and Hindson, authors of ``The Seduction of Power:Preachers, Politics and the Media,'' discussed the emergence of thereligious right as a political force at a recent conferencesponsored by the Center on Religion andamp; Society.   Hindson said the religious right's success in electing formerPresident Reagan and President Bush _ who support evangelicalpositions on abortion and ``family life'' issues _ may have leftsome evangelicals apathetic.   ``They don't see themselves threatened by the political party inpower,'' said Hindson. One poll showed more than 80 percent ofwhite evangelicals supported Bush, he said. ``I think the averagefundamentalist-evangelical is thinking, `Hey, eight more goodyears. Why worry about it?'''   The exception to the political inertia among religiousconservatives is the abortion issue, Hindson and Dobson said.   Operation Rescue _ a series of protests outside abortion clinics_ shows increased activism among ``younger, more radical''religious conservatives, said Hindson, a former religion professorat Falwell's Liberty University before becoming executive directorof the Center for Biblical Counseling and Education in St. Louis.   For evangelicals who believe abortion involves the taking of ahuman life, Hindson said, ``It is the ultimate moral issue of ourtimes.''   The march on Washington of at least 300,000 people advocatinglegalized abortion may jar more evangelicals back into thepolitical arena, he added. ``I think what happened ... is going tocause or force renewed coalitions among Catholics and evangelicalson the abortion issue.''   In their book, Dobson and Hindson say the religious right hashad mixed success with its political agenda, fending off the EqualRights Amendment and the gay rights movement, but failing to bringabout significant changes on issues such as abortion and publicschool prayers.   But Dobson dismisses criticism that fundamentalists wereexploited by the Republican Party. He contends the religious rightwas ``granted legitimacy'' by the GOP.   ``I would argue the religious right used the Republican Party asmuch as the Republican Party used the religious right,'' saidDobson, a former editor of the Fundamentalist Journal who workedwith Falwell for 15 years before becoming the senior pastor ofCalvary Church in Grand Rapids, Mich.   Still, the men said, the new prominence fundamentalists haveenjoyed in the media has also been a mixed blessing, with thedownfall in sex scandals of TV evangelists Jim Bakker and JimmySwaggart bringing unwanted notoriety.   When Falwell tried to step in to save Bakker's PTL ministry,Hindson said, he became ``a man in a white suit stomping all overthe barnyard.''   Hindson also said his old boss, through such actions as labelingNobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu a ``phony'' and hisreligiously based defense of such individuals as Oliver North anddeposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, provided an exampleof the dangers of stretching religious principles to defend extremepolitical views.   Saying evangelicals need to keep their political involvement inperspective, Hindson told a joke about Robertson that is making therounds of evangelical pastors:   ``Why would God let Pat Roberston run for the presidency?   ``One reason was to keep him out of the ministry and the otherwas to keep him out of the White House.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs May 5</NOTE></DOC>
