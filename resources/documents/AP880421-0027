The measure would ban exports from that country into the UnitedStates and from this country to South Africa, and would requireAmerican companies with offices or factories in South Africa topull out.   Supporters, the majority of them Democrats, say this is the mosteffective way to pressure South Africa into dropping its racialsegregation policies.   Opponents argue such a trade cutoff would cost South Africanblacks some 2 million jobs and would hurt American farmers andmanufacturers who export their goods.   The way to end apartheid is by infusing South Africa withcapital to help blacks improve their standard of living, said Rep.Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y. ``If we can help them better themselves,they will throw off their shackles on their own,'' he said.   The bill would affect about $1.1. billion dollars of U.S.investments in South Africa, as well as some $2.6 billion dollarsin trade.   A group of South African businessmen took out a full-page ad inWednesday's Washington Post, warning sanctions targeted at whiteswould stifle the country's development and hurt the black majority.   Two House subcommittees approved the legislation Wednesday andthe Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to debate it next week.Passage through the House is virtually assured, but the bill's fatein the Senate is less certain.   Exempt from the ban would be the imports of strategic mineralssuch as chromium, platinum and manganese, which the United Statescannot obtain elsewhere. But the bill would require theadministration to set up a program to reduce U.S. dependence onSouth Africa for such materials.   The bill, authored by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., is far morecomprehensive than the sanctions against South Africa approved in1986 after Congress overrode President Reagan's veto.   Those measures affected about one-third of South Africanimports, mainly agricultural products and computers, and less than3 percent of U.S. exports to South Africa. It banned new U.S.investments but permitted existing ones to remain.   The new ban, which would take effect within six months of thebill's enactment, would also exempt the donation of food, medicineand other humanitarian assistance, as well as U.S. government aidprograms for blacks.   Other provisions include:   _A ban on the transport of oil to South Africa from anywhere inthe world by U.S.-owned or registered ships.   _A ban on military and intelligence cooperation between U.S.government agencies and the South African authorities. This wouldcancel the posting of U.S. and South African military attaches ineach other's capitals.   _A ban on U.S. federal leases for coal, gas and oil deals tonon-Americans who invest in South Africa.   _Closure of two South African consulates in the United Statesand limited approval of visa requests by South Africans wishing tovisit the United States.   _A ban on direct flights to and from South Africa. Such a ban isincluded in the 1986 sanctions and is in effect now.</TEXT></DOC>
