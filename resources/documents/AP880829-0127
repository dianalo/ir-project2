Bishop John Brown said he was in Beirut to investigate the fateof four missing Iranians so Tehran would use its influence withpro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists who hold foreign captives.   ``The impression one gets very much is that the Iranians arevery anxious to have the hostages situation taken right off theiragenda,'' said Brown, who is the Anglican bishop of Cyprus, basedin Nicosia.   Eighteen foreigners now are held in Lebanon, among them nineAmericans and three Britons. They include Anglican church envoyTerry Waite and Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentof The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and isthe foreign hostage held longest.   Asked whether Waite and the others would be freed soon, thebishop said: ``I have no feeling about the timing of it. I feel he(Waite) will be released, but I have no knowledge of the timing.''   Brown arrived Sunday from Iran on his second visit to Lebanon ina month as representative of Archbishop of Canterbury RobertRuncie, spiritual head of the Church of England and leader of theworld's Anglicans. He spoke in a telephone interview with The AP.   On Sunday, Brown spent an hour with Patriarch Mar NasrallahButros Sfeir, spiritual head of Lebanon's Maronite Catholics, themain Christian sect.   ``When I came the first time a month ago I was asking questionsabout four Iranian hostages,'' Brown said. ``This time I reallycame back to ask the same people, especially the Maroniteleadership, if there are any answers.''   The bishop said he had some leads, but would not elaborate.   He seeks information on four Iranians who disappeared whiledriving in the Christian heartland north of Beirut after Israel's1982 invasion of Lebanon: Revolutionary Guards commander AhmadMotevaselian, Charge d'Affaires Mohsen Musavi; Kazem Akhavan ofIran's official news agency, and their driver, a Lebanese with anIranian passport.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament and itsmilitary commander, has promised to help free British hostages ifthe Church of England learns the fate of the missing Iranians.   ``I would like to know from the Christian elements in Beirutwhether or not there are any Iranian hostages alive at all,'' Brownsaid. ``This would be an enormous help for us.''   Brown would not say whether he would travel to Moslem westBeirut to talk with Moslem leaders about the chances of gettinghostages freed.   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving a westBeirut hotel for a meeting with captors of American hostagesAnderson, 40, and Thomas Sutherland, 56. No group has takenresponsibility for his abduction.   Sutherland was acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut when he was seized June 9, 1985. He andAnderson are held by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a group ofShiite zealots loyal to Iran's revolutionary patriarch, AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini.   Journalists John McCarthy and Alec Collett are the other Britishhostages.   McCarthy, 31, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, and no group hasclaimed responsibility.   Collett, 66, was abducted March 25, 1985, and responsibility wastaken by the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, whichis believed linked to the Palestinian terrorist group of Abu Nidal.   The group claimed April 23, 1986, that it hanged Collett inretaliation for British support of the U.S. air raids on Libyaeight days earlier, but no body has been found.   Brian Keenan, a 37-year-old American University of Beirutprofessor abducted April 11, 1986, is Irish but also carries aBritish passport.</TEXT></DOC>
