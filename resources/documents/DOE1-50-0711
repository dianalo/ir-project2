In particular, calculations are carried out for a boron/aluminumcomposite with a plastic, weakly hardening matrix of AD1 alloy. It isfound that, in fiber composites with a weakly hardening matrix, the longitudinalstress concentration in the fibers closest to the fractured fiber andthe extension of the stress zone do not depend on the fiber volume fraction.</TEXT></DOC>
