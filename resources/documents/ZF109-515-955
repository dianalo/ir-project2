 MS-DOS certainly belongs in any Genesis ofthe personal computer, not because it was the greatest operating system everwritten but because it was blessed by IBM and became the standard on which anindustry was built.andP;  Microsoft, with its unique blend of technical genius andmarketing savvy, used it to become, without question, the most importantcompany in personal computer software.andM;That was then, this is now.andP;  Good old character-based DOS will be with us forthe foreseeable future, but the action in personal computers is shiftingrapidly toward graphical user interfaces, multitasking, networking, andinteraction between applications.andP;  And once again, Microsoft is positioned tolead the way.andP;  Microsoft Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager, both carryingthe IBM Seal of Approval and both about to get important facelifts, finallyseem ready to start changing the face of computing in the 1990s as DOS did inthe 1980s.andM;Only this time the stakes are much higher.andP;  From a role as supporting actorto the mighty mainframe and minicomputer, the personal computer is on theverge of stardom.andP;  Networked PCs, running applications that talk to eachother and reach out to distant servers for &quot;mission critical&quot; data, will bethe basis of much office and factory automation in the coming decade.andM;Microsoft will be the pivotal player in this drama, setting the pace ofchange for virtually every hardware and software supplier in the computerindustry -- worldwide.andP;  That role, of course, will be challenged by thepending merger of Lotus and Novell, which was announced Friday, because thecombined companies will be similar to Microsoft in size, financial assets,customer base, and products.andP;  Most importantly, Lotus, which has developedone of the most promising network applications -- its Notes program -- willbecome the owner of the leading network operating system.andM;The new company, however, won't approach Microsoft in breadth ofapplications.andP;  And in applications software, we think Microsoft could have animpact equivalent to their impact in systems software, important as theirposition in operating systems has been and will continue to be.andP;  Already,applications account for most of the company's recent growth.andP;  (See the chartat the bottom of this page.)andM;The single best idea?andM;Applications will probably represent about half of fiscal 1990 revenues,which should come in at $1.1 billion or more.andP;  Only Lotus, presently runningabout even with Microsoft in personal computer applications, has a chance togenerate more revenues in that business this year.andM;And despite the fact that its high-margin royalty income is declining inimportance as applications revenue takes off, Microsoft has been able to keepprofits rising faster than revenues; they should reach $250 million thisyear, says Melinda Reach of Merrill Lynch.andP;  (See the chart on Page Three.)andM;Wall Street loves this company: At the recent meeting of the SoftwarePublishers Association, when we asked several securities analysts for theirtop stock pick, the unanimous answer was Microsoft.andP;  This despite a continuedrunup in the price of its shares, which are selling at a substantial premiumto the market.andM;Tools for the rest of usandM;Microsoft's size and breadth and its intimate understanding of operatingsystem and network issues suggest it will become the pacesetter inapplications technology.andM;Bill Gates, the ultimate operating system fanatic, now talks excitedly aboutthe need to &quot;change the way people think about applications.&quot;andP;  With operatingsystems that allow multiple applications to run simultaneously and tocommunicate freely, Mr. Gates says, individual applications should be thoughtof as tools -- less the focal point than the task or the data they areworking on.andM;Vision testandM;The first real test of Microsoft's new vision in both operating systems andapplications should come in mid-May, when the latest and, by all accounts,the most satisfactory version of Windows is now scheduled to be announced.andO;That date could slip again, of course, but so much information about Windows3.0 has leaked (flooded might be a better verb) that the timing seemsimmaterial.andM;By now, just about everyone knows that 3.0 is intended to deliver bigimprovements in performance and in the look and feel of the graphicalenvironment that Windows brings to the DOS world.andP;  Windows 3.0 takesadvantage of the protected mode in Intel's 286 and 386 microprocessors tocrack the 640K limit to directly addressable memory that puts a straitjacketon DOS applications.andM;Performance should be greatly improved for large applications that are boggeddown by the 640K barrier.andP;  Paul Brainerd of Aldus says he asked Mr. Gates forthree things in Windows 3.0: &quot;Performance, performance, and performance.&quot;andM;PageMaker's responsiveness under the new version, he reports, is tremendouslyimproved.andP;  Windows 3.0 also junks the clumsy MS-DOS Executive as the windowinto the file system in favor of a far more intuitive approach.andP;  And itprovides numerous improvements in the visual details that make all thedifference in a graphical interface.andM;Knife the Mac?andM;We won't know until we see it just how much better an environment Windows 3.0really is.andP;  Based on what we have heard, we don't think it poses an immediatethreat to the Macintosh.andM;True, a number of Mac software developers will migrate to Windows.andP;  As one ofthem told us, Windows 3.0 appears to be a development environment &quot;roughlycomparable to today's Mac.&quot;andP;  But the Mac has other advantages.andM;What about PM?andM;The most interesting questions have to do not with Windows' impact on the Macbut with Windows' impact on OS/2 Presentation Manager, the operating systemthat all parties agree will be the mainstream personal computer platform inthe future.andP;  Even the Windows boosters at Microsoft, which is just abouteverybody, expect OS/2 to start dominating corporate software decisions inthe next few years.andP;  But the pace and timing of the move to OS/2 tomorrow arelikely to be strongly influenced by the performance and appearance of Windows3.0 today.andP;  Windows is clearly an interim solution.andP;  But how long is that,exactly?andM;For a few dollars moreandM;If, for example, Windows can deliver serious performance improvements,multitasking, and a Mac-quality interface to the substantial installed baseof 286-based machines with a megabyte or two of memory, there could be astampede that would overwhelm Microsoft with orders.andP;  That would furtherdelay acceptance of OS/2, which is still struggling to get off the ground.andM;If, as the doubters at Lotus, WordPerfect, and Software Publishing insistwill be the case, Windows still requires a 386 machine with 3 megabytes ormore to provide acceptable performance, the scenario would be quitedifferent.andP;  The difference between system requirements for OS/2 and Windowswould boil down to a few megabytes of memory, which these days can be had fora few hundred dollars.andP;  And OS/2, with its superior security provisions,32-bit addressing, ability to run more than one process within applications,and almost unlimited access to memory, would be the obvious choice -- if theperformance issues and applications lists were comparable.andM;They aren't, of course.andP;  And somehow we doubt that the economic tradeoffsbetween Windows 3.0 and OS/2 will be that clear-cut, at least for a while.andO;System requirements depend heavily on the applications they are intended tosupport, and it is usually the applications that drive acceptance of anoperating environment rather than the other way around.andM;Where the apps areandM;Windows has overcome considerable developer foot-dragging to accumulate some900 applications, and we expect a burst of dramatic new products to accompanyor follow the 3.0 rollout.andM;Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet and Aldus PageMaker got Windows off the ground,and added impetus is coming from Microsoft Word, Corel Draw, and Samna's Ami,among others.andP;  But Windows lacks a world-class database and, mostimportantly, the leading DOS word processor -- WordPerfect -- and spreadsheet-- Lotus 1-2-3.andM;The database problem will probably be fixed soon.andP;  Borland, for one, haschanged its tune on Windows from disdain to praise and is expected to providea Windows 3.0 version of Paradox.andM;Ashton-Tate will probably join the bandwagon.andP;  And we think Microsoft isstill planning a database product of its own, although not in the immediatefuture.andM;True gritandM;Other developers are getting pressure from their customers to provide Windowsproducts, like it or not.andP;  Fred Gibbons, president of Software Publishing,has bet heavily on OS/2 products but now is gritting his teeth and committingto port those applications to Windows.andP;  &quot;OS/2 is the platform of the future,&quot;he says, &quot;but we have to be market-driven.&quot;andM;The most important endorsement comes from IBM, where support for Windows hasexisted mainly in pockets focused on school and publishing markets.andP;  TheComdex Accord last November, in which Mr. Gates agreed to give OS/2applications priority, also put IBM on record as backing Windows on systemsequipped with up to 2 megabytes of memory.andM;That represented the first time, as Mr. Gates is fond or reminding everyone,that IBM had said that Windows had an important role to play.andM;And where the apps aren'tandM;Meanwhile, only about 45 applications for OS/2 PM are shipping, but they nowinclude 1-2-3, and WordPerfect is promising to deliver a product this summer.andO;So many organizations, large and small, have standardized on those twoapplications that their presence or absence alone may be enough to sway manya decision.andP;  Neither Lotus nor WordPerfect is ruling out a Windows product,but they have taken such strong public positions against Windows and for OS/2that it seems to us highly unlikely they will back down right away, no matterhow good 3.0 looks.andM;But OS/2 still is in no position to attract the kind of momentum that Windowsis picking up.andP;  If it takes three generations to get an operating systemright, as the experience of Windows suggests, then OS/2 still has ageneration to go.andM;Developers working with OS/2 have been alternately ovejoyed and enraged atthe stream of upgrades and announcements of upgrades that have poured out ofMicrosoft.andP;  Even now, three years after the first version emerged, OS/2cannot be considered complete, developers complain, because it lacksimportant printer drivers, supports no large high-resolution displays, andwon't even run on the present version of Lan Manager.andM;Sand in the faceandM;Version 1.1, which is the platform for most of the applications now shipping,doesen't exploit the full power of the 386/486 generation of hardware andprovides only limited support for DOS applications.andP;  Even now, as recentInfoWorld benchmarking demonstrates, Windows on a 386 outperforms Version 1.1of OS/2 in many applications.andP;  Windows 3.0 will widen the gap.andM;Help for OS/2 is on the way, but not right away.andP;  Version 1.2, available onlyfrom IBM, still falls short, and Microsoft has withheld it for fear ofcausing more confusion than already exists.andP;  (At one point, four separateversions of OS/2 were under development at the same time.)andP;  Version 2.0, forwhich code was frozen just three months ago, solves most of the problems butwon't be a factor in the market until next year.andM;Even then, OS/2 will have its hands full competing with UNIX as the operatingsystem of choice for network applications.andP;  Although UNIX has yet to makeserious inroads into the office realm, the minicomputer and mainframecompanies are clearly pushing it in that direction.andP;  So far, only UNIX canexploit the power of RISC and multiprocessor technology or compete for themultiuser installations that are ready to move from minicomputers.andM;Spread the wealthandM;Microsoft's answer to this challenge is still a year or two away.andP;  MovingOS/2 to RISC hardware is a tricky thing, Mr. Gates assures us.andP;  &quot;You wouldn'tget it right the first time,&quot; he says.andP;  An elite NT Project (for newtechnology) team is tackling the problem with the usual Microsoft approach --lean and mean rather tan fat and happy -- but a RISC version of OS/2 isn'texpected expected until 1991.andP;  Meanwhile, a Florida start-up company calledCitrix is working on a multiuser version of OS/2.andP;  We think Microsoft willhave to encourage more of this kind of thing, even enlisting the support ofuniversity researchers, if it is to match the industry-wide effort that ispouring into UNIX.andM;Filling Jon's shoesandM;What we have here, in the coming clash between Windows and OS/2, is thepotential for a stalemate that will work to no one's advantage except Apple'sand that of the various UNIX camps.andP;  Resolving it is just one of thechallenges that will come at Microsoft as it tries out its new mantle ofindustry leadership.andP;  Others on Mr. Gates's to-do list: filling outMicrosoft's portfolio of applications in ways that demonstrate the power ofits new operating systems and building momentum for its network operatingsystem and database server products.andM;The selection of Mike Hallman to succeed Jon Shirley as president ofMicrosoft strikes us as an excellent way to begin.andM;The company will miss Mr. Shirley's deep understanding of the retail channel.andO;But Mr. Hallman, a 20-year veteran of IBM who is currently president ofBoeing Computer Services, brings something just as important to Microsoft'sfuture: an intimate knowledge of corporate computer needs.andP;  He should helpMicrosoft spread the gospel of networking and propel corporate America intographical computing.andM;Out of one, manyandM;With Windows apparently guaranteed a place in the mainstream, the task forapplication developers in the 1990s becomes that much more challenging.andP;  Thedominance of character-based DOS allowed them to get by with products forjust one platform through most of the 1980s.andP;  That simple strategy wasstretched by the growth of the Mac, and now it is simply out of date.andM;&quot;Windows will clearly be important,&quot; Symantec's Gordon Eubanks explains, &quot;butso will DOS, Mac, OS/2, and UNIX.andP;  If you accept that, then you have to havea strategy for multiple platforms.&quot;andM;The reosurces required to develop products that span all or most of thoseplatforms -- even for just one class of application -- are formidable.andP;  Sizealone would give Microsoft an advantage in a multi-platform world.andP;  ButMicrosoft has also been working for several years now to refine a developmentstrategy that targets three graphical platforms -- Windows, OS/2, and Mac --simultaneously.andP;  some 80% of the code for Excel, for example, is now sharedacross those three envionments.andP;  That helps to provide a common interface andfile format across all three and makes it easier to produce new versions on asingle timetable.andM;Strategy stretchersandM;The hardest part, and possibly the most important part, of an applicationsdevelopment strategy for the 1990s is to add the dimension of multipleapplications to a multiplatform agenda.andP;  If personal computers are ever to gobeyond personal productivity and tackle workgroup and corporate missions,they will have to have applications that work easily with other applications.andM;That's obvious to most developers, but again Microsoft seems to beexceptionally well positioned to make it happen.andM;Both Windows and OS/2 incorporate a protocol known as Dynamic Data Exchange(DDE) that allows programs to exchange data, and the Excel and Word teams atMicrosoft have been working diligently to exploit that technology.andP;  Word forWindows (Winword, as it is known around Redmond) does the most with thisconcept, as it should after five years in development.andP;  Word processingprograms, along with desktop publishing, have the most need for data exchangetechnology in an office environment because they tend to be where data fromspreadsheets and other sources is aggregated.andM;Smart applicationsandM;As a consequence, the architecture of winword is very different from mostword processors.andP;  In effect, it consists of a text processing enginesurrounded by a highly customizable user interface at the front-end and aDDE-based back end that links it to other applications and the rapidlyproiferating class known as network services.andM;This makes the product, like 1-2-3 or Excel, as much a development platformas an application.andP;  Object-oriented programming techniques, which allowpieces of the program to respond &quot;intelligently&quot; to messages and events, giveWinword enormous power and flexibility.andP;  By building up a series ofcustomized objects, users can tailor the program to carry out tasks as simpleas a mail merge or as sophisticated as a DDE sequence.andM;Automatic junk mailandM;For an invoicing application, as an example, clicking on a custom macrolaunches a series of programs that goes to the corporate database, pulls outthe appropriate information, sends it to a spreadsheet for calculating, thenincorporates the result in a dunning letter.andP;  This is the kind of thing thatMr. Gates is referring to when he talks about the task becoming the focalpoint, rather than the application.andM;Choose your partnersandM;Microsoft doesn't have a lock on this technology.andP;  Lotus and WordPerfect,through their alliance relationship, have come up with common DDE interfacesthat allow their OS/2 programs to exchange information seamlessly.andP;  They hopeto see their approach adopted widely.andP;  They also enhanced the PresentationManager interface to make it keystroke-compatible with DOS versions of theirprograms.andP;  But is one thing to work with partners on an ad hoc basis andquite another to have several product groups in the same boat and all, withany luck, rowing in the same direction.andM;It's not likely that Microsoft will be able to bring as much weight to bearon any one application as, say, Lotus in spreadsheets or Ashton-Tate indatabases.andM;But the commonality of code between applications and the ability to link themin ever more sophisticated ways will be an important selling point in thenext few years.andP;  It will become more important every time Microsoft fills asquare on its matrix of present or intended application targets, which nownumber six (word processing, spreadsheet, presentation graphics, database,electronic mail, and project management), plus the integrated Works products.andM;Little Red Hen syndromeandM;Closely tied to Microsoft's position in workgroup applications is its effortto become a major force in networking software and servers.andP;  Both LanManager, a network operating system built on an OS/2 nucleus with theassistance of 3Com, and SQL Server, a variation of the Sybase productdeveloped with Ashton-Tate in attendance, have encountered some rough earlygoing.andP;  In both cases, development and marketing partnerships didn't work outas planned, and Microsoft has had to take on a greater role.andM;That's appropriate, because these technologies are an integral part of thenew computing architecture that Microsoft is pushing.andP;  We don't expectMicrosoft to compete head-to-head with Oracle -- or Sybase, for that matter-- to put a server on every known computer brand.andP;  And up to now, Microsoftcan't be said to have competed effectively with Novell in the retail channel;NetWare has around 70% of the market for network operating systems.andP;  We doexpect Microsoft to be a lot more aggressive in selling both of thoseproducts along with its operating systems and applications to large companieslooking to build enterprise networks.andM;Three times the charmandM;Lan Manager is already making a comeback with Version 1.1, which shipped lastsummer and remedied such shortcomings in 1.0 as inadequate space forapplications.andP;  If the Rule of Three Generations holds true in this case,Version 2.0 should make Lan Manager fully competitive with NetWare 386 andprovide a springboard for the distributed architecture that up to now hasbeen somewhat theoretical.andM;That version was supposed to be in the hands of resellers in the firstquarter.andP;  It didn't make it, partly because testing on products of thiscomplexity takes so much longer, but it is in final beta testing and shouldbe out soon.andM;The problem with SQL Server is not a technical one.andP;  It tested at a veryrespectable 10.5 transactions per second on a Deskpro 386/33, just behind the11 tps reported by Oracle for its OS/2 server product.andP;  What SQL Server lacksis front ends -- the database and spreadsheet applications to make its poweruseful.andM;Those are coming.andP;  At least six are promised in the course of the next threemonths, probably including the all-important dBase.andP;  (Perhaps in response tothe marriage of Novell and Lotus, Microsoft should buy Ashton-Tate.)andM;Friends in high placesandM;When SQL front ends do arrive, now that Microsoft has taken on more of themarketing burden, we'd expect SQL Server to come into its own.andP;  Keep in mind,however, that buried inside Novell is an SQL-based server.andP;  Combining thatwith the already strong base that Lotus has in corporations could give it aformidable position from which to sell network solutions.andM;Selling networking products and solutions to the Fortune 500 will be nothinglike selling the high-volume single-user products that Microsoft grew up on.andO;&quot;they don't hop off the sehlf,&quot; remarks Mike Murray, general manager of thecompany's new Network Business Unit.andP;  Buying cycles for such products aremeasured in years, and the typical reseller can't get high enough in thecustomer's organization to compete for this kind of business.andM;Automating the clerksandM;Microsoft's network marketing strategy revolves around its relationships withthe big system vendors, starting with IBM and including Digital Equipment,Hewlett-Packard, and ATandamp;T, all of whom are resellers of Lan Manager.andP;  (IBM'sversion, called OS/2 Lan Server, is to be merged with Lan Manager).andP;  Thatmakes them candidates to sell SQL Server as well, a process Microsoft expectsto accelerate by tailoring the two products for individual customers.andP;  &quot;Plugand play is our direction,&quot; says Dwayne Walker, product manager for SQLServer.andM;The hope is that applications, operating systems, and networking productswill all play together.andP;  An early example of the kind of distributedcomputing installation Microsoft has in mind is an office automation networkbeing installed in nine floors of a Seattle high-rise by the law firm PerkinsCoie.andM;Software developed by Saros, a local start-up, uses an SQL Server engine tokeep track of documents and blocks of data stored on OS/2 servers.andP;  Lawyersusing Word for Windows and other applications can trigger searches thatretrieve files from anywhere on the network far faster than a clerk couldfetch them.andM;The task of selling this approach to customers around the world andsupporting the multivendor networks that result will test Microsoft'ssophistication, as well as that of its resellers.andP;  This doesn't mean gettinginto direct selling, says Mr. Gates, but it does mean much more high-levelcontact with customers.andP;  &quot;There is a vacuum there,&quot; he says, &quot;and it's up tous to fill it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
