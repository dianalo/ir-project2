Wright ``correctly recognized the utility of his speakership wasover,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who was chairman of a panelthat wrote many of the ethics rules.   President Bush praised Wright, a fellow Texan, saying in astatement, ``In spite of the present situation, I believe theWright tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication to theCongress of the United States.''   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said he hoped members listenedcarefully to Wright's urging that Democrats refrain from thoughtsof avenging the resignation, and that Republicans not try toretaliate for the defeat earlier this year of the nomination ofJohn Tower for secretary of defense.   ``He did an awful lot of good as speaker,'' Frost added.   Immediately after Wright made his announcement, Rep. JackBrooks, D-Texas, stood at the same podium on the House floor andexpressed his fears about the ``evil wind blowing in the halls ofCongress.''   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, former chairman of the ethicscommittee, warned that if the present mood remains ``the end resultwill be to destroy this institution as we know it today.''   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Wright'sresignation was a sad time for the House and for Wright, but added,``It is also an unprecedented opportunity for the House to begin abipartisan, comprehensive reformation of this institution and itsrules.''   And Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said the House is ``like a warzone right now where you don't know when the next bomb is going todrop.'' He said a time for healing is needed, but warned that ifHouse Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed the originalcharges against Wright, ``wants to engage in open warfare, therewill be a Democratic response.''   Gingrich, who waged a vigorous public battle against Wright,avoided reporters as he left the House chamber after Wright'sspeech.   But Richard Viguerie, chairman of the United Conservatives ofAmerica, said, ``Liberal Democrats can obviously dish it out togood and decent conservatives ... but they can't stand the heat inthe kitchen. The ethics war they started has turned against them.Conservatives don't want scalps. They want fairness.''   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who was involved in Wright'sdefense, said Wright's ``parting gift was a warning to stop'' thevengeance.   Torricelli said Wright had no choice but to resign rather thanfight the charges. ``He knew what the toll of that battle mightbe,'' the New Jersey congressman said.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., expected to be elected majorityleader after the elevation of Majority Leader Thomas Foley tospeaker, praised Wright's record.   ``Under Jim's leadership the House passed legislation on tradereform, plant closing, the drug problem, welfare reform, housing,aid for the homeless, clean water and other important measures,''Gephardt said. ``Jim has a record of public service that he can beproud of.''   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, head of the RepublicanCongressional Campaign Committee, said his party planned to use theresignation as a campaign issue unless Democrats passed an electionreform package acceptable to the GOP.   ``I feel truly sorry for Wright as a human being'' he added, butcalled the Wright case an example of corruption that occurs whenone party is in control of an institution for too long.   ``I believe that in his heart he doesn't believe he did anythingwrong,'' Vander Jagt said.   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., called Wright's speech ``a verypoignant, emotional moment in American history. It was almost likeHamlet, a prince on his knees.''   ``He missed his calling; he should have been a trial lawyer,''Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio. ``If he had been giving a summation to ajury he would have walked.''</TEXT></DOC>
