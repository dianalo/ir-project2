Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., had proposed a compromise to the $14.3billion money bill for the fiscal year that begins this Oct. 1,shifting $166 million into categories the administration wants _primarily military aid to friendly countries.   But as the meeting of the Appropriations Committee's ForeignOperations panel began, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., asked to beallowed to offer an amendment that would cut development aid toChina through the International Development Association.   Obey, seeing the move as an effort to score political points atthe expense of Democrats, reacted angrily: ``Unless we havebipartisan agreement, we don't have any intention of supporting theagreement worked out with the administration. It's just thatsimple.''   Ranking GOP subcommittee member Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, hisvoice rising, said Obey was asking for too much. There would be no``gag rule,'' he declared. ``You can play games all you want.''   Responded Obey: ``If I buy this amendment, I want to know what itgets us.'' Obey later adjourned the meeting indefinitely and toldreporters he was tired of taking the heat for pushing an unpopularbill which the White House wants far more than does Congress.   The bill in dispute appropriates money for the full range of U.S.foreign aid programs for the coming year, from subsidies formilitary equipment purchases to aid for health and development inthe Third World.   At the same time, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee failedfor the fifth time to muster a quorum needed to take action on itsown foreign aid bill, which would set the policies under which theaid money would be spent.   Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said he would tryagain Wednesday to get enough senators together so the measure couldbe sent to the full Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
