In a 3-0 ruling, the appeals board found that the GSA was prejudiced against ATandamp;T in the bidding for $55 million in contracts to replace a dozen large phone switches. The board also accused GSA engineer Lal Soni of improperly &quot;auctioneering,&quot; or leaking ATandamp;T pricing data to the regional Bell companies in hopes of driving down prices.    &quot;The GSA's determinations give the appearance of being willfully dismissive of the facts and biased against ATandamp;T,&quot; Vincent LaBella, an administrative judge, wrote for the three-person board. The four disputed contracts involved switches in Atlanta, New Orleans, Philadelphia and San Francisco. The Atlanta and New Orleans contracts had been awarded to BellSouth, while the Philadelphia job had been given to Bell Atlantic Corp. and the San Francisco contract to Pacific Telesis Group.    The appeals board also upheld two other contracts, including one to Bell Atlantic and one to U S West Inc., and ordered the GSA to re-evalute bids on a third contract, which also had been awarded to U S West.    While BellSouth was dismayed by the decision, Bell Atlantic was pleased that the ruling would allow the company to retain the contract for another switch that it had been awarded. Pacific Bell said it will appeal the ruling.    For ATandamp;T, which has claimed since last year that the GSA has treated it shabbily, the decision is a big victory. In a statement the telecommunications giant said the ruling &quot;clearly establishes that the GSA mishandled both the procurement and ATandamp;T's protest in a way prejudicial not only to ATandamp;T's intrerests but also to the government's own interest.&quot;    The ruling also might give ATandamp;T a leg up in competition to replace the federal government's aging telecommunications system for as much as $25 billion over 10 years. A decision on the so-called FTS-2000 contract, which is to be split by two teams of contractors, is expected Sept. 30.    &quot;The GSA is already behind the eight ball and on the defensive regarding anything ATandamp;T comes up with,&quot; said Robert Dornan, vice president of Federal Sources Inc., a federal procurement consultant in Vienna, Va. &quot;This might bias GSA in the future in favor of ATandamp;T.&quot;    The decision also is likely to further sour relations between ATandamp;T and its offspring, who are frequent opponents in business, the courts and Congress.    Clyde Pearce, the GSA's general counsel, denied the agency had any &quot;systematic&quot; bias against ATandamp;T and denied that the ruling would affect the FTS-2000 award.    The phone contract dispute &quot;was the end to the pretense of any gentlemanliness&quot; in the former Bell system, said Albert Halperin, a former common carrier chief at the Federal Communications Commission.    The appeals board ruling was especially harsh on BellSouth, alleging that the phone company improperly received &quot;valuable bidding information&quot; from Mr. Soni. Mr. LaBella cited an expense voucher of a BellSouth salesman who took Mr. Soni and Mr. Soni's daughter, who is a BellSouth employee, to dinner to discuss the phone contract and &quot;career opportunities within the telecommunications industry.&quot;    Mr. Soni and his daughter refused to answer questions during the appeals board trial, citing their constitutional right against self-incrimination. John Dowd, Mr. Soni's lawyer, said his client didn't leak bidding information. The appeals board &quot;doesn't have its facts straight,&quot; he said. &quot;They use hearsay.&quot;    The appeals board ruling also said that Bell Atlantic received confidential ATandamp;T pricing information, which was useful in bidding for the Philadelphia switch. But Mr. LaBella awarded the Philadelphia contract to ATandamp;T on other grounds -- alleging that the GSA had improperly evaluated ATandamp;T's bid. He cited the same grounds for stripping Pacific Telesis of the San Francisco contract.    The GSA had contended that ATandamp;T shouldn't be awarded the phone contracts because it allegedly received confidential information from Mr. Soni, but the appeals board rejected that argument. The panel, however, denied ATandamp;T's request that it be awarded all seven phone switch contracts originally granted to the Bell companies. The appeals board ruled that the bias against ATandamp;T wasn't strong enough to justify that sanction. ATandamp;T initially won five of 12 the contracts.    Atlanta-based BellSouth, in a statement yesterday, noted that in January it acknowledged that confidential information may have influenced its bid for the Atlanta and New Orleans switches and that it offered to withdraw from the contract. &quot;Obviously, we are disappointed that the judge failed to acknowledge the good faith that BellSouth has shown in these actions and its cooperation&quot; with investigations into the dispute, the statement said.    Pacific Telesis, which is planning to appeal yesterday's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals, said the GSA's cost evaluation of its bid for the San Francisco switch was &quot;proper,&quot; and the award shouldn't have been reversed, a spokesman said.    In Philadelphia, Raymond Smith, Bell Atlantic's president and chief operating officer, was pleased by the ruling despite losing the contract for the Philadelphia switch. &quot;Bell Atlantic has been vindicated and cleared of any wrongdoing -- as we were confident we would be,&quot; he said. &quot;We are pleased we were awarded the largest switch in the procurement,&quot; he added, referring to the switch for Washington,D.C.    A spokesman for U S West, which will keep its phone switch contract for Minneapolis, said the ruling supported the company's position that it didn't receive confidential information. The company account executive Karl Payne, who according to testimony by a GSA official had said he received confidential ATandamp;T information, left the company in February for reasons unrelated to the dispute, U S West said. The Denver-based company said it now hopes for a prompt re-evaluation of the contract for Seattle, which it also had been originally awarded.    Spokesmen for ATandamp;T and Martin Marietta Corp. said yesterday's action won't affect their bids for the FTS-2000 contract. ATandamp;T has made a joint bid with Boeing Corp., and Martin Marietta is leading a team of bidders that includes the Bell companies. Asked if ATandamp;T might seek a delay in the bids, which are due April 30, the company spokesman said: &quot;We want the procurement to move ahead, but we want it to have absolute security.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, ATandamp;T closed at $26.50 a share, down 75 cents; BellSouth closed at $39, down 62.5 cents; Bell Atlantic closed at $66.50, down 87.5 cents; Pacific Telesis closed at $28.875, down 37.5 cents, and U S West closed at $52.25, down 87.5 cents.    ---   Mary Lu Carnevale in Washington and Jeffrey A.
