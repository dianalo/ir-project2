Procedures have been developedfor analyzing the Sr isotope ratio, Sr and Rb abundances, and C and Oisotope values for sample sizes of 2 mg or less. Drilled crinoids haveSr that is more radiogenic (0.70810-0.70845) than Mississippian sea water(0.7076), but generally less radiogenic than whole rock samples (0.7080-0.7089),drilled apatites (0.70880), plucked crinoid grains (0.7085-0.7090), drilledmicrite (0.70853-0.71255), or late vug saddle dolomite (0.70967) andcalcite (0.70890). Shale layers within the Keokuk Fm. have initial Srof 0.708 to 0.714. Mass balance considerations suggest that these shalescannot be the primary source of the radiogenic Sr. The variations inC and Sr may reflect various extents of interaction with regional groundwaters or brines. The micrite and apatite were apparently more stronglyaffected by later fluids than were the coexisting calcite cements withinthe crinoids.</TEXT></DOC>
