Ltd. has announced its strategy for the future, whichwill include new initiatives for its standards suite, convergence with thegovernment's Posix standard and more work with the federal government, anorganization spokesman said.andM;Mike Lambert, X/Open's chief technical officer, said the consortium'sportable operating system standard will be revised to be compatible withFederal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 151.andP;  FIPS 151 calls forUNIX-based systems in government to employ the Posix application-to-operatingsystem interface standard.andM;In its next Portability Guide, to be released at the Uniform UNIX trade shownext month in San Francisco, X/Open will detail its plans to converge itsstandards with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST)Posix standard.andM;However, subtle differences between the two standards will continue to existfor awhile, partly because X/Open maintains an international focus, Lambertsaid.andP;  &quot;The U.S.andP;  government represents a significant market for X/Open butnot the only market,&quot; he said.andM;One difference between FIPS 151 and X/Open's standard exists in the area ofjob control.andP;  NIST makes job control mandatory, while X/Open does not.andP;  &quot;Ifwe were to make job control mandatory, there'd be no X/Open-compliant systemsright now,&quot; he said.andP;  This will change as both the FIPS and X/Open'sstandards are revised.andP;  X/Open plans to make job control mandatory, he said.andM;As this occurs, &quot;systems will able to conform to both X/Open and NIST FIPS,&quot;Lambert said.andM;To help ensure this, X/Open will place a research associate in NIST'sNational Computer and Telecommunications Laboratory to help the agencyenhance the Posix standard and to work on the other standards in itsApplications Portability Profile (APP) standards suite.andP;  X/Open's NISTresearch associate will begin work within a month, Lambert said.andM;New Name for SystemandM;Meanwhile, the international consortium of computer system vendors promotingopen systems standards tentatively will call its future system the X/OpenOpen Systems Environment, as opposed to its current Common ApplicationsEnvironment.andP;  This environment will include the X/Open Portability Guide(XPG), the X/Open Connectvity Guide, the X/Open Security Guide and the X/OpenUser Interface Guide.andM;The new Portability Guide, XPG 3, not only will promote Posix convergence butalso will include new communications services and windowing standards,Lambert said.andP;  Communications services in the X/Open Transport Interface willbe targeted at systems programmers.andP;  The guide will not define protocols, butwill be an application programming interface to networking services.andP;  &quot;It'sindependent of the protocol underneath,&quot; Lambert said.andM;XPG 3 also will include the X/Open Window Definition.andP;  The standard will bebased on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's X Window standard,Version 11 Release 2 XPG's 3 also will contain enhanced definitions forCOBOL, Ada, ISAM and source code transfer.andP;  X/Open also will vigorouslypursue standards in the system administration area, Lambert said.andM;The consortium's Connectivity Guide will adopt protocol standards for localarea and wide area networks.andP;  It also will offer guidance on external datarepresentation, data set announcement and office document interchange formatstandards, Lambert said.andM;The X/Open Security Guide, due next month, will describe UNIX securityfacilities that already exist to make systems more secure.andP;  These facilitiesdo not satisfy the Defense Department's Orange Book requirements, however,Lambert said.andP;  In the future, the group will offer services to help usersmeet C2 level security and also will explore security issues outside thegovernment arena.andM;Security ConcernsandM;The group wants to determine whether security requirements can be met withoutthe cost and overhead involved with Orange Book certification.andP;  &quot;We're justtrying to find out whether it is valid to apply the Orange Book outside theU.S.andP;  government.andP;  We haven't got any preconceived ideas; we don't knowwhether that's the case or not.andP;  And I think we shouldn't be working on theassumption that it is without checking it out,&quot; Lambert said.andM;He said X/Open's CAE and NIST's APP have very much in common.andP;  &quot;There are noconflicts or major areas where we say something different.andP;  There are someareas we haven't addressed yet,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;However, except in the area ofPosix, the APP is just a list of FIPS.andP;  It merely lists standards, it doesn'tintegrate them like our environment does.&quot;andM;In addition, Lambert acknowledged that groups like the Open SoftwareFoundation (OSF) and UNIX International have affected his group's reputationand have put pressure on the group to deliver on its portability promises.andM;&quot;I think the formation of OSF and UNIX International has had an effect onX/Open because, clearly, I think the industry would have preferred there notto be an OSF or UNIX International.andP;  But unfortunately there are very goodreasons why those companies formed particular alignments,&quot; he said.andP;  Severalcompanies in both the OSF and UNIX International are X/Open members.andM;While OSF will develop products, X/Open's role specifically precludes productdevelopment, Lambert said.andP;  &quot;Our job is to adopt widely supported vendorconsensus standards,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The reasons behind OSF are extremely complexand certainly some of them relate to differences of opinion that some ofthose companies have with ATandamp;T regarding licensing policies.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
