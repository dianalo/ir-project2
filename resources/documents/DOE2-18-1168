The framework is designed to help interpretavailable evidence of possible violations and respond appropriately tothat evidence. The ``evidence'' consists of estimates of the yield ofSoviet tests. Interpreting and responding to evidence of possible violationsrequires a series of technical determinations and policy judgments. Thedecision maker may wish to consider: the degree of uncertainty in themonitoring data; potential Soviet violation scenarios and their significance;the probability of Soviet violations; the relative values of corrector incorrect responses; and the role of US responses to evidence in deterringfuture violations. The decision framework provides methods for incorporatingexplicitly each of these factors when interpreting and responding toevidence. The framework is best viewed as an aid to decision making.The intent, of course, is not to replace the policy maker with an analyticprocess. Rather, the framework provides a systematic method for organizingand incorporating diverse inputs, exploring the implications of alternativetechnical and value judgments, and understanding complex trade-off. Byexercising the framework, technical analysts and policy makers can buildnew insights, which ultimately can lead to better compliance evaluationdecisions. 31 refs., 32 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
