That was the largest purchase for ComputerAssociates since its 1989 acquisition of Cullinet SoftwareInc., a big bite that weighed down operations and ended whathad been an aggressive buying spree.   Now, analysts said, Computer Associates seems voraciousagain. &quot;They appear to have shaken off the negative effectsof the Cullinet acquisition and to be more aggressive again,&quot;said Stephen T. McClellan, who tracks software stocks forMerrill Lynch. &quot;They've really come out with all gunsblazing.&quot;   Computer Associates officials said On-Line and Pansophicrepresented the first good acquisition values the company hasseen in two years. &quot;We've been saving our money and waiting,&quot;said Sanjay Kumar, senior vice president at ComputerAssociates.   Still, Mr. Kumar denied that the company was planning awave of buying. &quot;We're not on a march,&quot; he said. &quot;We haveenough to worry about in integrating these two firms.&quot;   Computer Associates, which has $260 million in cash,expects to firm up borrowing plans to finance the Pansophicpurchase by Friday.
