AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegahas dodged another bullet, the arrests of three high-rankingofficers following a coup attempt shows the deep divisions in theforce that he depends on for survival.   The general's victory bared weaknesses in his control of theDefense Forces, the top authority in a country where civiliangovernments have been a facade for military strongmen.   On Wednesday, Col. Arnulfo Castrejon said Noriega had been takenhostage by commanders of the headquarters guard shortly after hewalked into his office the day before.   According to Castrejon, Noriega kept his captors calm and triedto avoid bloodshed, ``confident the Defense Forces would solve theproblem.''   Loyal units then moved from outlying bases, counterattacked andforced the rebels to surrender.   That was an impressive display of loyalty to a commander who wasout of position to command, and it first appeared that he hadquashed a coup launched by a few disgruntled junior officers.   But when the list of those arrested was released Wednesdaynight, it included 23 officers, a much wider group than previouslythought.   Most surprising on the list were the names of Cols. GuillermoWong, Julio Ow Young and Armando Palacios Gondola. They weremembers of the 20-man High Command that Noriega had packed with hismost trusted aides.   Noriega now must restructure his top staff with the knowledgethat there are probably many other officers who are resentful,envious, angry or ambitious even though they did not join the coup.   ``He must know that he cannot trust anyone now,'' said RicardoArias Calderon, leader of the Christian Demcratic Party and aformer vice presidential candidate.   ``If I was in Gen. Noriega's shoes, I'd be a very nervous mantonight,'' U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reportersWednesday in Washington.   Military infighting inspired the coup attempt, as the communiquereleased by rebels pointed out. They said their purpose was toretire Noriega and other members of the general staff.   But after emerging from his bullet-pocked headquarters, Noriegacould take pride in the loyalty of the bulk of his force even whenhe was not in position to command them.   He also saw that fully mobilized U.S. troops in combat gearstood by as the coup was crushed, even though the Washinton hasbeen trying to oust Noriega for more than 1{ years.   It was a clear sign to other potential plotters that the UnitedStates would not lend even passive aid _ such as blocking allaccess to Defense Forces Headquarters _ to a coup.   For anyone unable to figure it out, U.S. Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III made it perfectly clear.   ``The United States retains the option to use American forces.That option has never been ruled out,'' Baker told the SenateFinance Committee. ``But if you're going to risk American lives,it's the president's view that you do so on your own timetable. Youdon't do so on the basis of someone else's plans and in response torapidly changing circumstances.''   ``The gringos will act when it is to their own interest,'' saida Panamanian oppositon source, ``not when it is in the interest ofthe Panamanian opposition.''   A third positive factor for the general was the passivity of thecivilian opposition, which Arias said had no contact with theplotters.   ``Their communique indicated they wanted Noriega out andsupported the provisional government that Noriega set up,'' Ariassaid.   A victory for the plotters would not likely have been a victoryfor democracy.   ``In this kind of confrontation if we went on the streets wewould be only providing the dead,'' Arias said.   Noriega must have noted that another group of people beholden tohim stood aside until they saw which way the wind was blowing.   The civilian government he appointed was silent during the earlyhours of the attempt. On Wednesday, pro-government radio announcersadmitted some government employees had danced with joy as theyfollowed the first news bulletins.   Perhaps the biggest plus for Noriega is simply that he survived.He defeated a coup on March 16, 1988; he has outlasted U.S.sanctions, election defeats, and now a much larger coup.   ``He has more lives than a cat,'' an opposition source said.``We just don't know how many he has used.''
