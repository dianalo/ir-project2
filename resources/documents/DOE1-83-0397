<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-0397 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report summarises and critically discusses the results obtained fromthermal shocks locally applied to the inner surface of the RPV-cylinder.This evaluation is based on on-line measurements (temperatures and strainsat the RPV-wall during the thermal shock loading, non-destructive-testing),on materials investigations, and on theoretical investigations (finiteelement calculations, fracture mechanics analyses). The comparison betweenthe corresponding measured and calculated results serves as a basis forsubsequent assessments. It was the object of these tests to achieve thefollowing primary aims: - Investigation of the loading conditions producedby local thermal shocks during realistic cooling processes. - A betterunderstanding of the physical processes involved in crack initiationand propagation resulting from thermocyclic loading. - Assessment ofnon-destructive-testing methods with respect to detection and analysisof cracks as a basis for fracture mechanical evaluations. - Assessmentof the reliability of the applied structural analysis methods. - Productionof naturally formed deep cracks on the inner surface of the RPV-cylinderby means of excessive cooling processes.
