Harunori Takahashi, president of E.I.E. Development Co., joined Kerry Packer, chairman of Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd., in a conditional agreement to acquire the stake for 93.4 million Australian dollars ($64.3 million) from Judge Corp., a New Zealand investment company that also suffered in the crash. Bruce Judge, who controls Judge Corp., agreed to step down as Ariadne's executive chairman following the acquisition.    The accord has intensified speculation about Ariadne's future and the possibility that it might have to shed assets world-wide to raise funds. The property, resources, financial-services and industrial concern has been one of Australia's fastest-growing companies in recent years. In the year ended June 30, its revenue rose 20%, to 1.18 billion dollars, while profit jumped 159%, to 142.2 million dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
