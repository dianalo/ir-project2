A 14-member team of U.S. experts was to fly to Laos aboard twoC-130 transport planes Sunday morning for the dig, but the Laotiansdid not give the planes clearance to enter, spokesman Ross Petzingsaid.   Petzing refused to comment when asked why Laos put the project onhold.   However, the Laotians may have been irritated when the UnitedStates earlier this week criticized them for allegedly failing tocooperate in the war against narcotics.   An annual report that Secretary of State James Baker sent toCongress lists a handful of countries that it declares ineligiblefor U.S. aid because of their support for drug trafficking.   In the report, which was released Wednesday, President Bushrecommended that Burma and Laos be added to that list.   The report said U.S. officials believe opium production isexpanding in Laos and that heroin is being refined there for exportthrough Thailand, Vietnam and China.   U.S. officials have said there is evidence that Laotian officialsare involved in the processing and smuggling of drugs. When thatcharge surfaced in last year's narcotics report to Congress, theLaotian government issued a stern denial.   The United States is trying to account for 547 Americans listedas missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam war. Many wereairmen who flew reconnaissance and bombing missions.   Laos had conducted four joint excavations with the United States.The first one was in Feb. 1985.   The Pentagon said the latest excavation was to have beenconducted in an area in southern Savannakhet province which aU.S.-Laotian team had surveyed last December. However, the UnitedStates has no record of a U.S. plane crashing there.   Petzing said the U.S. team had planned to work 8-10 days at thesite.</TEXT></DOC>
