(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A picket was shot and slightly woundedat a non-union coal mine today, and some of the 42,000 miners offthe job in 10 states say they were theatened with violence if theyreturned to work under court order.   Judges in at least four states have ordered the miners back towork. Today was the 10th day of wildcat walkouts in support of 1,900miners on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. since April 5.   Jamie Blankenship, 18, the son of a disabled miner, was grazed inthe head as he picketed at Hampden Coal Co., a strike-closed mine inWest Virginia. Blankenship, who is not a miner, was treated at ahospital and released.   Blankenship was believed to be the first person wounded bygunfire since the unauthorized walkouts began. Previously, othershad been hurt by rocks.   State Police said no arrests were made. Officials at Hampden Coaldid not immediately return calls.   A UMW official said Wednesday that he sees no quick end to theunauthorized walkouts, citing millions of dollars in fines thatcourts have levied against the union.   ``Our members feel like they're fighting for our wholeorganization,'' said Howard Green, a UMW international executiveboard member from Charleston. ``They feel the courts are being usedas a means for destroying our organization.''   Green said miners have shown up for work but have encounteredpickets and refused to cross the line.   ``I've been warned by pickets, `We'll find out where you live,'''miner Ted Sanson said. ``The judge didn't understand this part _ thefear. Are those marshals going to be there when I get off work?''   Consolidation Coal Co. is seeking back-to-work orders innorth-central West Virginia and said it planned to take similaraction in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois.   The company told a federal judge Wednesday that it was losing$500,000 a day at its north-central operations alone.   Tazewell County, Va., Circuit Judge N.E. Persin on Wednesdayfined the union $300,000, saying it was responsible for picket linemisconduct that resulted in coal trucks being hit by objects.   One Alabama company has asked the courts to order miners back towork, and two others have filed complaints with the National LaborRelations Board. One company, Jim Walters Resources, said it islosing $600,000 a day.   The union already has been assessed fines of $3 million inVirginia, and a federal judge Wednesday fined six West Virginiaunion locals $2,500 each for defying a back-to-work order.   West Virginia police said shots were fired Wednesday afternoon ata security guard shack at the Logan-Mingo Mine Co. office nearGilbert. Guards were in the shack at the time but no one was injuredand no arrests were made.   In a separate strike, a Raleigh County, W.Va., judge on Wednesdayordered county and state law enforcement officers to beginround-the-clock patrols at a New Beckley Mining Corp. operation nearGlen Daniel to prevent violence.   About 130 miners who have been on strike there since January in acontract dispute have joined with Pittston miners in several rallies.   According to union and industry officials, the estimated numberof miners involved in unauthorized walkouts Wednesday are: WestVirginia, 16,000; Illinois, 8,000; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio, 2,660;Pennsylvania, 6,600; Indiana 1,750; Kentucky, 1,500; Virginia, 755;Missouri, 350; and Tennessee, 200.</TEXT></DOC>
