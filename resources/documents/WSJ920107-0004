The regional Bell telecommunications company's actionfollows similar recent moves by other regional Bells. Thecompanies have been trying to pare management ranks in a bidto be more cost-efficient during a period of anemic growth intheir core local phone operations.</LP><TEXT>   The charge reflects costs of a job-reduction plan PacificTelesis announced two years ago. At the time, it said itexpected to reduce 11,000 jobs through 1994. The chargeincludes the cost of severance programs offered in the lasttwo months, as well as downsizing costs over the next threeyears, the company said.   As of Dec. 30, when the 1991 severance program ended,about 4,300 managers had accepted the offer. To date, about6,500 have accepted, the company said.   A year earlier, Pacific Telesis earned $196 million, or 50cents a share, including a reserve adjustment that cut net by$71.5 million, or 18 cents a share. Most of that adjustmentreflected the sale of real estate. Revenue was $2.44 billion.The current charge of $120 million equals about 30 cents ashare, Pacific Telesis said.   The company said that since the 1984 breakup of the Bellsystem, its main Pacific Bell Telephone unit has eliminated17,000 jobs, while new access lines have grown by 3.5million. But the Bells' growth in access lines -- new phonelines to customers -- slowed last year as recession hurtdemand.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, PacificTelesis fell 75 cents a share, to $44.25.</TEXT></DOC>
