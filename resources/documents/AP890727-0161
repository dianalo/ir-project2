The National Research Council report said blacks have been hurtby a slowdown in the U.S. economy during the last two decades andby persistent racial inequalities in education, housing and otheraspects of American society.   ``A legacy of discrimination and segregation continues to affectblack-white relations,'' said study director Gerald Jaynes, a YaleUniversity professor of economics and African-American studies.   The $2.7 million study, entitled ``A Common Destiny: Blacks inAmerican Society,'' was financed by several foundations andcharitable organizations for the National Research Council, theprinciple operating agency of the National Academies of Sciencesand Engineering, a congressionally chartered, private non-profitorganization.   Begun in 1985, the study is based on data and research analysesassessing the position of blacks in American society since the eveof World War II. The 22-member study committee included experts ina range of academic specialties.   Jaynes said the study committee found that ``by any calibrationother than that of an unrepentant segregationist, race relationsand blacks' status are remarkably improved since the World War IIera.''   However, ``the status of blacks relative to whites has stagnatedor regressed since the early 1970s,'' he said.   The report said blacks' status was improved by a rapidly growingU.S. economy in the three decades following the war, which boostedthe standard of living for all Americans.   Blacks also have benefitted from the civil rights movement andfrom a social activism that have bolstered equal opportunityefforts, the report said.   However, the slowdown of the U.S. economy in the early 1970s hashurt the earnings of Americans generally, and particularly thosewith the least skills and lowest incomes.   Although blacks' earnings have risen relative to whites duringthe last 15 years, this gain is partially offset by reducedemployment rates for blacks, the report said.   During this period, the proportion of black families withincomes of more than $35,000 annually increased from 16 percent in1970 to 21 percent in 1986. At the same time, the segment withincomes below $10,000 grew from 27 percent to 30 percent.   The gap between the races in terms of poverty has been about thesame since 1939 _ black poverty rates are about two to three timeswhite poverty rates.   Mean earnings for blacks and whites improved steadily from 1939through 1969 and then slightly through the 1970s before dropping inthe 1980s. However, blacks also improved their earnings in relationto whites, making about 42 percent of per capita white earnings in1939 but 56 percent by 1984. During this period, black women allbut closed the gap, rising from 56 percent of per capita whitefemale earnings to 96 percent in 1984.   The report said attitudes toward work and the desire to succeedare about the same among the poor and the better off.   Residential and educational segregation continues to hold blacksback, the report said.   Housing segregation that has concentrated blacks in major urbanareas has not changed much since 1960 and, in 1980, nearlytwo-thirds of black students in public elementary and secondaryschools attended schools where more than half the students weremembers of minorities, the report found.   Blacks also face a large gap in mortality and morbidity relativeto whites. Infant deaths are twice as high for blacks as forwhites, and 22 percent of blacks, compared with 14 percent ofwhites, don't have health insurance and aren't covered by Medicaid.</TEXT></DOC>
