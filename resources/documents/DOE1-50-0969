During this transformation,the acetylenic hydrogen undergoes a 1,2 shift which causes a kineticisotope effect of 1.8 on the overall enzymatic rate. The same productsand kinetic isotope effects are observed when the arylacetylenes areoxidized by m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Suicide inactivation of P-450 bythe arylacetylenes, which occurs simultaneously with metabolite formation,is insensitive to isotopic substitution so the partition ratio changesfrom 26 for phenylacetylene of 14 for [1-{sup 2}H] phenylacetylene.</TEXT></DOC>
