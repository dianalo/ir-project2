The regulations up for vote govern the information thatofficers, directors and major shareholders of a company arerequired to report to the SEC whenever they trade their owncompany's stock.</LP><TEXT>   Currently, the SEC requires these insiders to reportpurchases and sales of company shares by the 10th of themonth following the trade. Many investors watch thesetransactions for clues to the outlook for a company'sbusiness and the direction of its stock price.   Under the new rules, which are designed to streamlinefederal bureaucracy and promote compliance, manymiddle-management executives would be exempt from reportingany stock trades. The proposed changes also would allowexecutives to report exercises of options later and lessoften.   The new regulations are controversial. Since proposing thechanges in December 1988, the SEC has received more than 400letters of comment. In general, attorneys and corporationshave supported the changes, arguing that they lay out clearerguidelines and eliminate nettlesome paper work. Banks, inparticular, have applauded the proposed changes because oflarge numbers of employees in that industry who carry thetitle &quot;vice president.&quot;   But investors and money managers contend the proposedrules would undermine the usefulness of information oninsider trades as a stock-picking tool. Some are concernedthat if the SEC eliminates filings by middle-management, itwill become more difficult to spot telltale clusters oftrading activity in which more than one officer or directoris buying or selling in a short period of time.   &quot;In general, the principle ought to be the more, themerrier,&quot; says William Miller, president of Legg Mason FundAdvisory, the unit that manages Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.'sequity funds. &quot;The more disclosure we've got, the better theinformation.&quot; The SEC must balance any cost or efficiencysavings of the new rules with the &quot;greater awareness ofcompanies&quot; that the current reporting requirements bring, hesays.   Agency officials declined to comment on the proposed rulesbefore the commission's vote. But in earlier interviews,Brian Lane, special counsel in the office of disclosurepolicy, which drew up the proposals, said that the rules, ifadopted, &quot;will be at least as effective, if not more so, forinvestors following transactions.&quot;   The proposed rules would still require top executives,officers who set policy or head divisions and executives whooversee company finances to file reports on theirtransactions in company stock. Those exempted would includevice presidents who aren't directly involved in settingcorporate policy.   Peter Romeo, a Washington, D.C., attorney and co-author of&quot;The Section 16 Reporting Guide,&quot; a handbook on insiderreporting and trading regulations, says adoption of the newstandards would be a &quot;vast improvement&quot; over existingregulations. &quot;You won't have those ceremonial officersreporting; you'll be getting to the essential insiders.&quot;   But the stock purchases and sales of a company's topofficials are often &quot;somewhat deceiving&quot; because thoseofficials know their transactions are closely watched, saysJohn Sturges, an equity portfolio manager at Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc. &quot;Market moves seem to be more sensitive to the{transactions of} vice presidents, the guys further down theladder,&quot; he says.   Wealthy top officials can afford to hold their stockthrough thick and thin, Mr. Sturges adds. Middle-managementexecutives &quot;tend to sell more quickly than the chairman&quot; whenthey think the company's stock is over-valued, because it isoften a sizable chunk of their compensation.   Separately, the SEC is also expected to adopt a rulechange that will penalize late insider filers. Under theproposed regulations, companies would be required to publishin annual proxy statements the names of insiders who missedthe SEC's filing deadline. The SEC has said that roughlyone-third of corporate insiders file their reports late.</TEXT></DOC>
