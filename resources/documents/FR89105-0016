Introduction</ITAG>The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, 30 U.S.C. 1001-1025 (the Act), establishedthe statutory framework for the leasing and management of geothermal resourceson public, withdrawn, and acquired lands administered by the Departmentsof the Interior and Agriculture. The Act mandates that geothermal leaseswill provide for a royalty on the amount or value of steam, or any otherform of heat or energy, and byproducts derived from production under thelease and sold or utilized by the lessee or reasonably susceptible to saleor utilization by the lessee. The Geothermal Resources Lease (the leaseinstrument) expands on the royalty provisions of the Act by adding thatroyalties must be paid on the amount or value of geothermal resources produced,processed, removed, sold, or utilized from the lease or reasonably susceptibleto sale or utilization by the lessee. However, the lease instrument providesthat unused geothermal resources may be reinjected into the subsurfacewithout payment of royalties if such reinjection is approved by the properauthority.The Act delegates to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior allauthority for the administration of Federal geothermal leases, includingissuance of rules and regulations as appropriate to implement the Act.The lease instrument expressly authorizes the Secretary to establish minimumvalues for the purpose of computing royalties in accordance with applicableregulations. Geothermal valuation regulations currently appear at 30 CFR206.350 and 206.351, which were redesignated from andSection;andSection;206.300and 206.301 in a <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice published on January 15, 1988 (53 FR 1184).The foremost use of geothermal resources is the generation of electricity.The development of the geothermal industry in the United States receiveda significant boost with passage of the Public Utilities Regulatory PoliciesAct of 1978, 16 U.S.C. 2601 (PURPA). The act provided both an avenue forthe ownership of small power generation facilities by entities other thanutilities and price incentives for the sale of electricity. The implementationof PURPA was particularly beneficial for geothermal development becauselessees could commercially exploit more resources, particularly the smaller,moderate-temperature geothermal resources in remote areas.As a primary source of thermal energy, or heat, geothermal resources havea variety of uses, which was recognized by the Act. However, unlike oil,gas, coal, and other energy commodities, geothermal resources can neitherbe transported long distances nor stored; they must be utilized immediatelyafter production and in close proximity to the production well. The temperatureof the resource by-and-large dictates the type of utilization of the resource.Higher-temperature geothermal resources are predominantly used to generateelectricity, which, consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics, isessentially a form of energy converted from the thermal energy of the resource.Lower-temperature geothermal resources are suitable for direct utilizationprocesses; that is, space heating and agricultural and manufacturing operationsrequiring process heat. The recovery of byproducts (sulfur, lead, zinc,potassium compounds, etc.) and demineralized water is feasible, but hasnot yet been accomplished on a commercial scale.The existing regulations provide only general guidance for the valuationof geothermal production. This is particularly true with respect to thoseresources that are utilized by the lessee and are not involved in a salestransaction. This proposed rulemaking is designed to provide greater clarityto geothermal valuation regulations. Currently, this greater clarity isprovided by policy interpretation.To take advantage of electricity price incentives offered under PURPA,an increasing number of lessees are utilizing geothermal resources directlyin their own powerplants for the generation and sale of electricity. Inthese situations, there are no sales of the resource on which to base value.Consequently, MMS established a geothermal netback procedure to value these``no sales'' resources, relying primarily on the existing regulations at30 CFR 206.350(a)(2) and (b)(2). The netback valuation procedure was firstapplied in 1985. In addition, MMS developed guidelines for the valuationof geothermal resources that were sold prior to power generation, alsorelying on the existing regulations at 30 CFR 206.350. The netback procedureand other guidelines for valuing Federal geothermal resources used to generateelectricity were made available to the public in October 1987 with theissuance of a report entitled ``Valuation of Federal Geothermal Resources_ElectricalGeneration.'' The netback procedure was revised in June 1988 to reflectchanges effective March 1, 1988, regarding MMS's policy on computing transmissionand generating deductions, including changes concerning the rates usedto compute returns on investments.The guidelines appearing in the June 1988 report ``Valuation of FederalGeothermal Resources_Electrical Generation'' (and its October 1987 predecessor)represent MMS's official valuation policy and are to remain in effect untilnew valuation regulations are published as a final rulemaking. Copies ofthe revised report may be obtained by contacting the person identifiedin the ``Address'' section of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Background</ITAG>The MMS is proposing to revise the current regulations regarding the valuationof geothermal resources to accomplish the following:(a) Clarify and expand on existing valuation policy and standards as theyapply to geothermal resources used for electrical generation.(b) Provide clear standards for valuing geothermal resources used in directutilization processes.(c) Provide clear standards for valuing geothermal byproducts.(d) Place the geothermal royalty valuation in a format compatible withthe valuation regulations for other leasable minerals.(e) Provide industry and the public with a comprehensive and consistentgeothermal valuation policy.Structurally, these rules would modify the existing provisions and addnew sections to Subpart H of 30 CFR Parts 202, 206, 210, and 212. Theseproposed rules would be applied prospectively and would supersede all currentlyeffective geothermal resource valuation directives issued by MMS or itspredecessor agency, the U.S. Geological Survey. The MMS anticipates thatspecific guidelines governing reporting requirements consistent with thegeothermal valuation regulations will be incorporated into an MMS GeothermalPayor Handbook subsequent to the publication of the final rule in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The purpose of the regulations is to define the value, for royalty purposes,of geothermal resources produced from Federal lands. Indian lands wereexcluded by the Geothermal Steam Act. Value can be determined in differentways, and these proposed rules explain how value would be established undervarious circumstances. Valuation standards are grouped according to howthe geothermal resource is utilized: Electrical generation, direct utilization,and/or recovery of byproducts. Within each group, valuation standards aredescribed according to the type of transaction: arm's-length or non-arm's-lengthand dispositions of the resource not subject to a sales transaction (theso-called ``no sales'' transactions). Valuation procedures are differentfor each group.The term ``gross proceeds'' is introduced into the valuation standardsto replace the ``total consideration'' language at paragraph (a)(2) ofandSection; 206.350. The concept, however, remains the same: Value cannotbe less than the gross proceeds (total consideration) accruing to the lesseefor any disposition of the geothermal resource.Valuation standards for geothermal resources used to generate electricityfollow the criteria and procedures, with certain modifications, establishedin the June 1988 report ``Valuation of Federal Geothermal Resources_ElectricalGeneration.'' The proposed rulemaking codifies the netback procedure usedfor valuing geothermal resources under ``no sales'' situations. Valuationprocedures for geothermal resources used in direct utilization processesfollow the internal procedures and practice used by MMS.The proposed rule is a departure from the existing regulations. The chiefdifference is the elimination of the list of factors given at existing30 CFR 206.350(a) that were to be considered in establishing the valueof geothermal resources. That list does not give priority to any particularfactor. By contrast, the proposed rule establishes specific conditionsand procedures for valuing the resource.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Requested Comments on Selected Issues</ITAG>The public is invited to comment on all aspects of the proposed rulemaking.Comments on specific sections should identify the section number and paragraphbeing addressed. In addition, MMS is requesting comments on the specificissues described below.Section 202.353 Measurement standards for reporting and paying royaltiesThis proposed section establishes for the first time consistent units ofmeasurement for reporting geothermal production for royalty purposes. Inthe past, geothermal production has been reported in a multitude of units,including kilowatthours and megawatthours of electricity, pounds and thousandsof pounds of steam, and gallons of water. The MMS proposes to standardizethe reporting units by specifying that valuations in terms of electricitywould be reported as kilowatthours, valuations in terms of weight wouldbe reported as thousands of pounds, and valuations in terms of thermalenergy would be reported as millions of Btu's.The MMS is proposing that direct utilization resources and commerciallydemineralized water be reported in units of hundreds of gallons to thenearest hundred gallons. However, MMS is unsure whether such a requirementis appropriate, or whether the reporting units should be in gallons orthousands of gallons. Accordingly, MMS is requesting comments and recommendationson the proper reporting units when measurements are on a volume (gallonage)basis.Section 206.352 Valuation standards for electrical generationThis proposed section establishes procedures for valuing geothermal resources(steam and hot water) used to generate electricity. Values are determinedin accordance with the type of transaction under which the resource isdisposed: Arm's-length sales, or non-arm's-length and ``no sales'' transactions.For geothermal resources sold under an arm's-length contract, proposedandSection; 206.352(b) would provide that the lessee's gross proceeds (revenueplus any other consideration directly or indirectly received for the dispositionof the resource) accruing from the arm's-length sales transaction wouldestablish the value of the resource for royalty purposes. This is a generalrule that essentially follows the existing arm's-length valuation guidelinesgiven in the June 1988 report ``Valuation of Federal Geothermal Resources_ElectricalGeneration.'' However, MMS reserves the right under the proposed regulationsto establish a different value if it determines that the contract doesnot reflect the total consideration passing between buyer and seller ordiscovers that the value is unreasonable owing to impropriety between thecontracting parties.For geothermal resources used to generate electricity and not sold underan arm's-length contract_that is, those resources sold to the lessee'spower-generating affiliate under a non-arm's-length contract or resourcesutilized by the lessee in its own powerplant and thus not subject to asales contract_proposed andSection; 206.352(c) would provide a sequence ofbenchmarks to value the resource. The value would be established in accordancewith the first applicable of the following procedures:(1) The weighted average of the gross proceeds paid or received by thelessee under its own arm's-length contracts for the purchase or sale ofsimilar quantities of like-quality resources in the same field;(2) The value determined by the netback method taking into account thelessee's costs of generating and transmitting electricity; or any otherreasonable valuation method approved by MMS.(The word ``lessee'' also refers to the lessee's power-generating affiliate.See proposed definition of lessee in proposed section 206.351.) Under nocircumstances, however, will MMS accept a value that is less than the grossproceeds received by the lessee under its non-arm's-length contract forthe sale of geothermal resources from the lease. Gross proceeds alwaysestablishes a minimum value against which other values are compared.The MMS believes that the first valuation benchmark_the weighted averagemethod_would be infrequently employed; there are likely few instances wherethe lessee, or the lessee's power-generating affiliate, will purchase additionalgeothermal resources to supply the powerplant or where the lessee willhave excess production to sell to other operators. However, it introducestwo concepts that depart from valuation criteria commonly used for otherleasable minerals, notably oil and gas: (1) MMS is proposing that purchasesor sales of geothermal resources in other fields (the ``area'' concept)would not be considered in establishing geothermal values, and (2) theprices established in the contracts of other lessees in the same fieldwould not be considered in establishing geothermal values. The physicaland chemical characteristics of geothermal resources vary widely from fieldto field, primarily because of differences in temperature, salinity, phase,and producibility of the geothermal fluid. Even in geothermal provinces,such as the Salton Trough of Southern California and adjacent Mexico, thephysical and chemical characteristics of the geothermal fluids from eachof the many fields are different. Geothermal fluid characteristics dictatethe type of conversion technology and design of the powerplant for utilizationof a particular geothermal resources. For these reasons, MMS believes thata valuation based on comparison to contract sales outside of any givenfield is inappropriate. Accordingly, the ``area'' concept no longer wouldbe used for geothermal resource valuation. Comments are invited regardingthis concept.With respect to the second concept, several factors can influence the valueor price of geothermal resources even within the same filed. A major factoris the variety of methods used to establish geothermal price in arm's-lengthcontracts. For example, at the Geysers steam field in California, the salesprices of the steam resource vary by a factor of more than two, owing tothe multiple methods of computing those prices. Some of the stem is pricedin terms of net kilowatthours generated based on the purchaser's avoidedcosts of fossil and nuclear fuels used in conventional powerplants. Othersteam is priced in terms of thousands of pounds delivered based on a varietyof economic indexes. Another factor that can influence geothermal valuesis powerplant efficiencies. Because of design and age differences, eachpowerplant has a different efficiency for converting heat into electricity.As a general rule, operators of the more efficient powerplants are willingto pay higher prices for the geothermal resource because of cheaper conversioncosts. Powerplant efficiencies thus can significantly affect the unit priceof the resource. Considering the complexity of the factors involved, MMSbelieves that a geothermal valuation based on prices established in thecontracts of other lessees in the field in not appropriate. This conceptalso would eliminate from consideration any valuation based on a majorityprice as currently provided for at 30 CFR 206.350(a)(1). The MMS has foundthat the establishment of a majority price is impracticable for geothermalresource valuation and is proposing to abandon this procedure. Commentsare requested on this concept of not using prices established in otherlessee's contracts to determine value.The use of the first ``other than arm's-length'' valuation benchmark wouldbe predicated on the lessee's sale, purchase, or other disposition of a``similar quantity'' of like-quality resource. The intent of this limitingcondition is to avoid a valuation based on sales or purchases of smallvolumes that would unduly affect the value of the majority of the lessee'sproduction.The MMS anticipates that the procedure prescribed in the second benchmarkwill be the predominant valuation method used to value geothermal resourcesthat are used to generated electricity and disposed under non-arm's-lengthand no sales situations. When geothermal resources are used to generateelectricity_that is, the thermal energy of the resource is converted intohigher priced electical energy_MMS believes that the value of the resourceis effectively enhanced by the conversion process. The netback procedurecompensates for this enhancement of value by subtracting the costs of electricalgeneration and transmission_the transmission and generating deductionsdescribed in proposed andSection;andSection; 206.343 and 206.354, respectively_fromthe sales price of the electricity. However, several in the geothermalindustry believe that the netback procedure yields values that are unrealisticallyhigh and thus do not reflect a ``market value'' on which royalties shouldbe based. Accordingly, MMS is seeking comments on whether the netback procedureshould be modified and, if so, how.One of industry's more serious concerns regarding the netback calculationis the rate of return allowed on invested capital used in the determinationsof the transmission and generating deductions. A return on investment isprovided to reimburse the lessee for the cost of capital necessary to fundconstruction of the powerplant and transmission facilities. The rate ofreturn specified in the proposed regulations for determining transmissionand generating deductions is 1.5 times the Standard and Poor's BBB industrialbond rate. The MMS is seeking comments on whether this rate of return isappropriate for geothermal power projects, or whether some other rate ofreturn should be used. Respondents should explain the rationale for theirproposed rates of return and include citations of publicly available referencessupporting or clarifying their proposal.A ``proportion-of-profits'' method has been proposed as an alternativeto the netback valuation procedure. Instead of a standard rate used tocompute the return on invested capital under the netback procedure, theproportion-of-profits method provides for a return on invested capitalby allowing each aspect of the project (resource development and production,power generation, and transmission) to earn the actual return earned bythe project as a whole. The proportion-of-profits method is premised onthe theory that each dollar of invested capital earns the same percentageof project profits. Accordingly, the value of the resource upon which royaltyis based would be determined by the proportional share of the geothermalproject's net operating income attributable to the geothermal field. Theunit value of the geothermal resource (in dollars per kilowatthour) isdetermined by the equation <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),L1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,s10,11,20,r10</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Unit value</H1><H1>= GE+(NOIandmultiply;FI/TI),</H1><H2>EO</H2><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where GE is the geothermal field operating expenses plus royalties,NOI is the net operating income of the entire project (electricity salesrevenue less transmission, generating, and field expenses), FI is the investmentin the field (acquisition and development costs), TI is the total investmentin the geothermal project (field, powerplant, and transmission line investments),and EO is the amount of delivered electricity. The MMS is requesting commentson the applicability and feasibility of using the proportion-of-profitsmethod for determining geothermal values. An ``alternative-fuels'' approach has also been proposed as a substitutefor to the netback procedure. The alternative-fuels approach is currentlyused to value geothermal resources used in direct utilization processes.Under this method, the value of the geothermal resource would be basedon the Btu-equivalent value of conventional fossil fuels (coal, oil, orgas) used to generate electricity. (See discussion of proposed andSection;206.355,valuation standards for direct utilization, for suggested equation to computethermal energy utilized.) This method would assign a value based on theprice of fossil fuels compared to the amount of thermal energy consumedin the powerplant. Because powerplants using conventional fuels operateat much higher temperatures and pressures than do geothermal powerplants,other factors (such as combustion and boiler efficiencies) may have tobe considered under this valuation method. The MMS requests comments andanalyses on the feasibility of using the alternative-fuels method for valuinggeothermal resources in all cases. The MMS also requests suggestions onhow the Btu-equivalent value of alternative conventional fuels should bedetermined. The MMS is contemplating whether the valuation of electricity should beaddressed in connection with the netback procedure. Under most currentsituations, the powerplants that are owned and operated by geothermal lesseesare certified as ``small power production facilities'' under PURPA. Accordingly,electric utilities are required to purchase the electricity from thesepowerplants at rates based on the purchasing utility's avoided costs, pursuantto rules implementing PURPA as delegated to State regulatory authorities.In these instances, the geothermal lessee/powerplant owner usually receivesboth an energy payment and a capacity payment for the delivery of electricity.The energy payment represents the purchasing utility's avoided costs offuels used to operate conventional powerplants. The capacity payment representsthe utility's avoided costs associated with capital investments in powerplantsand transmission systems to meet customer delivery demands or utility loanrequirements. Capacity payments are generally set amounts based on minimumdelivery requirements. They are often made in equal monthly installmentsfor making available to the utility a certain amount of electricity. Under the netback procedure, the value of the electricity forms the basisfor deriving the value of the geothermal resource. The MMS has historicallyconsidered the value of the electricity as including both the energy paymentand the capacity payment, pursuant to the ``total consideration'' conceptat existing 30 CFR 206.350(a)(2) and the ``value of the end product'' conceptat existing andSection;206.350(b)(2). This philosophy has been carried overinto the proposed regulations in the definition of ``gross proceeds.''However, some geothermal lessees have argued that the capacity paymentshould not be included as part of the value of electricity because thecapacity payment reflects the powerplant's ability to deliver electricityand thus depends on the attributes of the powerplant itself and not onthe geothermal resource. (This viewpoint can be argued from the oppositeperspective in that a powerplant cannot operate, especially at peak efficiency,without a sufficient supply of quality fuel_that is, geothermal resource.)The MMS is aware that all or some portion of capacity payments may continuein certain cases, such as forced outages, without delivery of electricity.Although these instances of nondelivery are usually temporary, they doraise the possibility of the lessee receiving a payment when geothermalresources are not produced or utilized. However, MMS is also aware thatgeothermal production is seldom completely shut in during periods of powerplantdowntime or outages. Rather, production is generally either vented or flowedthrough powerplant bypasses during downtime to maintain the working conditionof wells and gathering lines, or continues to generate electricity to maintaininternal powerplant operations during forced outages. On the premise thata capacity payment may trigger a royalty obligation without there beingany geothermal production, MMS is requesting comments on whether capacitypayments should be included as part of the value of electricity. The MMSwould also like to know to what extent geothermal production is shut inwhen no electricity is delivered but capacity payments are still received.If capacity payments are not included as part of the value of electricity,MMS would likely consider them as reducing the lessee's powerplant operatingcosts; the generating deduction would then be reduced accordingly.   Another concern regarding the valuation of electricity for applicationof the netback procedure is when the geothermal lessee/powerplant operatoris also an electric utility company; in other words, when there are nothird-party sales of the electricity on which to base value. One possibilityof establishing the value of the electricity at the powerplant tailgatewould be a weighted average of the utility's customer rates less transmissioncosts. The MMS requests comments on this and on alternative electricityvaluation methods when the geothermal lessee is also the power-generatingutility company.The MMS is also contemplating whether or not to address the valuation ofthe resource when the lessee has an arm's-length generating agreement witha third party but receives revenue from the sale of electricity. Such asituation would arise where a lessee has an electricity sales contractbut, for whatever reason, has a third party generate the electricity. TheMMS believes that the chances of this situation occurring are remote and,therefore, has not addressed this situation in the proposed regulations.Nevertheless, MMS is requesting comments on whether such a situation islikely, whether it should be addressed in the rulemaking, and, if so, whatmethods should be used to value the resource.If MMS finds that value cannot be determined by either the weighted averagemethod or the netback procedure, the second valuation benchmark would provideMMS with regulatory flexibility to develop or approve different valuationmethods and procedures.Sections 206.353 and 206.354 Determination of transmission and generatingdeductionsThese sections establish the procedures for computing transmission andgenerating deductions used in the netback valuation method. In additionto the question of the appropriate rate of return on capital investmentdiscussed above, MMS is requesting comments on the following issues commonto the determination of both deductions.(1) The proposed regulations provide that transmission-line costs and generatingcosts can be computed using either a straight-line depreciation with areturn on undepreciated capital investment, or a return on capital investmentwithout depreciation. The return on capital investment method would beapplicable only to those facilities first placed into service on or afterMarch 1, 1988. March 1, 1988, is the effective date of new oil and gasvaluation regulations that were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 15, 1988 (53 FR 1184 and 1230), whichfirst provided for the use of the return-on-capital investment method.This method, as well as the effective date, was adopted for geothermalresource valuation. The adoption of this method is not precluded by currentregulations. The MMS requests comments on whether there should be a one-timeelection to use the return-on-capital investment method for those facilitiesplaced into service before March 1, 1988.(2) The proposed regulations limit depreciation to the life of the geothermalproject, with the caveat that this usually means the term of the electricitysales contract unless the lessee can show otherwise. The MMS must be protectedfrom situations in which an electricity sales contract may expire and thelessee is unable to negotiate a new contract, even though the lease isstill capable of production and the powerplant remains operable. Accordingly,MMS requests comments on whether depreciation should be based on a fixedtime period commensurate with the first sales agreement or some other reasonableperiod of time, and what conditions or considerations might extend or decreasea depreciation period.(3) The proposed regulations prescribe that a powerplant or transmissionline would be depreciated only once; that is, the depreciation scheduleestablished by the original owner would not be altered with a change inownership. Because the Government does not participate in the profit orlosses that could result from a sale of a powerplant or transmission line,MMS takes the position that it should share in the depreciation of thosefacilities only once. Comments are invited on the issue of recapitalizationand the justification of redepreciating a powerplant or transmission linewith a change in ownership.The proposed regulations also provide that if the transmission and/or generatingdeduction, as determined at the end of the annual reporting period, resultsin a netback value that is less than that on which the lessee paid royaltiesthe lessee is due a credit. Refunds are not encouraged by the MMS becauseof undue administrative burdens. Rather, any credit for royalty overpaymentswould be taken against future royalty payments until the credit is depleted.Instructions on taking credits would be addressed in the Geothermal PayorHandbook to be prepared sometime after final rulemaking.Section 206.355 Valuation standards for direct utilizationThis proposed section establishes the procedures for valuing geothermalresources (hot water) that are used for purposes other than electricalgeneration (for example, space heating, greenhouse operations, and industrialprocesses). As with geothermal resources used to generate electricity,the proposed regulations for direct utilization resources prescribe thatvalue will be based on either the lessee's gross proceeds received underan arm's-length sales contract, or the first applicable benchmark for dispositionsunder non-arm's-length or ``no sales'' situations. The benchmark valuationsystem for direct utilization resources differs from that for geothermalresources used to generate electricity in that the second benchmark prescribesa value based on the least expensive, reasonable alternative fuel source.Most direct utilization geothermal resources will likely to be used bylessees in their own facilities and thus not subject to either arm's-lengthor non-arm's-length sales. Accordingly, MMS anticipates that the secondbenchmark_the least expensive, reasonable alternative fuel approach_willbe the predominant method used to value direct utilization resources. Thisis essentially the same method currently used by MMS, except for the proposedinclusion of an efficiency factor in the equation used to calculate theamount of thermal energy displaced by the geothermal resource. The efficiencyfactors corrects for the fact that not all of the heat derived from combustionof an alternative fuel can be converted to an equal amount of utilizedgeothermal heat. It takes more heat from the combustion of alternativefuels to create an equal amount of geothermal resource heat directly utilizedbecause of boiler losses and stack emissions. The equations for determiningthe amount of fuel (in terms of Btu's) displaced by the geothermal resourceunder the proposed rule is<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,25,37</C> <H1>Thermal energy displaced =</H1><H1>(h</H1><T2>in</T2>^h<T2>out</T2>) andmultiply; density andmultiply; 0.133681 andmultiply; volume,<H2>efficiency factor</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where h<T2>in</T2> is the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the utilization facility inlet(based on measured inlet temperature), h<T2>out</T2> is the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the facility outlet (basedon measured outlet temperature), density is in lbs/cu ft based on inlettemperature, the factor 0.133681 (cu ft/gal) converts gallons to cubicfeet, and volume is the quantity of geothermal fluid in gallons producedat the wellhead or measured at an approved point. ``Thermal energy displaced''is then in Btu's. Assuming a geothermal efficiency factor of 1.0, MMS proposedto use an efficiency factor of 0.7 for coal and 0.8 for oil, natural gas,and related fuels (butane, propane, diesel, etc.). (Efficiency factorsfrom Ball, Vic, 1983, Generating greenhouse heat: Grower Talks, v. 46,no. 12, p. 20-28.) The value of the geothermal resource is then determinedby multiplying the amount of thermal energy displaced by the unit value(dollars per Btu) of the alternative energy source. The MMS requests commentson whether this method correctly reflects the value of geothermal resourcesused in direct utilization processes, on what alternative methods may beused, and on the applicability of using the efficiency factors.In addition to the efficiency factor, the proposed alternative fuel approachdiffers from that currently used by specifying the least expensive, reasonablealternative fuel. This qualification essentially restricts the alternativefuel chosen to one that would normally be used in a given direct utilizationprocess at the location of utilization. For example, coal may not be areasonable alternative fuel for some processes or in some locations becauseof environmental considerations. The MMS would like comments on whetherthis qualification is warranted and, if so, what criteria should be usedto determine the most reasonable alternative fuel.The MMS has not addressed in the proposed rulemaking how the reasonablealternative fuel would be valued, preferring at this time to consider individualcircumstances. Spot prices for oil and gas, as published in trade journals,local market prices for the alternative fuels, and average regional pricesfor coal as published by the U.S. Government's Energy Information Agencyhave been used or considered in the past. The MMS would like comments onwhether the valuation of alternative fuels should be addressed in the finalrulemaking and, if so, what criteria should be used to value the alternativefuel.Section 206.356 Valuation standards for byproducts.This proposed section describes the methods that would be used to valuebyproducts, including commercially demineralized water, recovered fromgeothermal production. As contemplated by the definition of ``byproduct''in the Geothermal Steam Act, byproducts are recovered after a geothermalresource has been used in a geothermal utilization facility (a powerplantor direct utilization facility). Although byproducts are not being recoveredon a commercial scale_to MMS's knowledge_at this time, some sulfur is currentlybeing recovered by hydrogen sulfide abatement facilities in connectionwith power generation. However, the sulfur apparently is not being commerciallysold. Other byproducts that could potentially be recovered include sodiumand potassium compounds and, if economics should prove feasible, perhapslead, zinc, and other metallic elements.As with geothermal resources used to generate electricity or used in directutilization processes, the value of the byproduct would be establishedeither by the lessee's arms-length contract or by the first applicablecriteria under a non-arm's-length or ``no sales'' benchmark system. Brieflysummarized, the benchmark criteria are ordered as follows:(1) The lessee's gross proceeds accruing under its non-arm's-length contractif those gross proceeds are equivalent to the gross proceeds derived undercomparable arm's-length contracts for like-quality products <T3>in</T3> the field;(2) The lessee's gross proceeds accruing under its non-arm's-length contractif those gross proceeds are equivalent to the gross proceeds derived undercomparable arm's-length contracts for like-quality products <T3>outside</T3> the field;(3) Other relevant matters, such as spot-market prices; or (4) A netback method or other reasonable valuation method.Unlike fluid geothermal resources used to generate electricty or used indirect utilization processes, byproducts can be stockpiled for future sales;thus, they can be considered more in terms of conventional marketable commodities.Accordingly, MMS is proposing to look at sales prices outside the fieldto establish value as necessary. The MMS is requesting comments on theproposed byproduct valuation procedure and whether there are any alternativemethods of valuing byproducts.The proposed regulations provide for a ``byproduct transportation allowance,''addressed at proposed andSection;andSection; 206.357 and 206.358. The MMS considerstransportation costs borne by the lessee as an added-value service thatshould be deducted from the sales price to determine value of the byproductat the lease. The transportation allowance would be applicable only formovement of the byproduct to a point of sale or delivery off the lease,unit, or participating area. The determination of the allowance followsthe same general principles as that for oil and gas transportation allowances.The MMS will not address specific transportation issues in this preamble,but invites comments on the procedure used to determine the allowance,including the costs allowed.The MMS does not propose to provide a processing allowance for byproductrecovery at this time, owing to the lack of both byproduct recovery projectsand experience regarding byproduct recovery technology. However, MMS isrequesting comments on whether a processing allowance for byproducts shouldbe included as a deduction in the valuation regulations. If so, how shouldit be computed, and what limitations or conditions should be placed onthe allowance.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Miscellaneous Issues</ITAG>The MMS is requesting comments on three issues concerning geothermal resourcesused to generate electricity or used in direct utilization processes notaddressed in previous discussions: (1) Should MMS grant transportationallowances for the lessee's costs of delivering the resource to a pointof utilization (powerplant or direct utilization facility) off the lease,unit, or participating area; (2) should MMS allow costs associated withhydrogen sulfide abatement facilities (and other facilities to mitigateenvironmental hazards) as part of the determination for generating deductionsunder the netback procedure; and (3) should any processing allowances begranted for geothermal resources used in direct utilization processes.With regard to transportation of geothermal production, MMS has taken theposition that it is the lessee's responsibility under the lease and theoperating regulations at 43 CFR 3260.5(c) to transport the resource fromthe wellhead to the point of utilization (powerplant or direct utilizationfacility) in an efficient manner. As a general rule, geothermal utilizationfacilities are located close to the production well, usually within a mile.However, it is possible to transport hot water several miles, or even tensof miles, for space-heating purposes. The MMS currently considers all pipelinesconnecting wellheads and powerplants or direct utilization facilities asa field gathering system, and all costs of gathering are regarded as production-relatedcosts that are not shared by the Government. Nevertheless, to considerpossible futher long distance transportation, MMS is requesting commentson whether transportation allowances are justified to transport the resourceoff the lease, unit, or participating area. If transportation allowancesare granted, they would require that the lessee follow a strict reportingprocedure; the reporting requirements would likely include the submittalof detailed documents supporting the lessee's allowance.With regard to inclusion of the costs of hydrogen sulfide abatement facilitiesand other facilities to mitigate environmental hazards as part of the generatingdeduction under the netback procedure, MMS has taken the position thatthe lessee is solely responsible for all activities related to operationof the lease and management of the resource in an environmentally soundmanner, pursuant to 43 CFR 3262.1(b). This is particularly appropriatewhen the powerplant or direct utilization facility is located on the lease.The MMS is aware that geothermal emissions, particularly hydrogen sulfide,are restricted in many areas by local environmental authorities, and thusthe geothermal resource can only be utilized when the environmetal restrictionsare mitigated. Accordingly, MMS is requesting comments on whether the costsof hydrogen sulfide abatement facilities and other facilities to mitigateenvironmental hazards can be justifiably included in the generating deduction.With regard to the granting of processing allowances for geothermal resourcesused in direct utilization processes, MMS at this time cannot conceiveof any circumstances that would warrant a direct utilization processingallowance. Direct utilization normally involves the use of a heat exchanger,which would be required whether a geothermal resource is used as the heatsource or whether some other fuel is used as a heat source. Nevertheless,MMS is requesting comments on what direct utilization technologies wouldjustify a processing allowance and, accordingly, on whether a processingallowance should be provided in the valuation regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Executive Order 12291The Department of the Interior (Department) has determined that this documentis not a major rule and does not require a regulatory analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. This proposed rulemaking will establish regulations to reflectcurrent policy and practices with respect to the valuation of geothermalresources used for electrical generation and provide standards for valuinggeothermal byproducts and resources used in direct utilization processes.Regulatory Flexibilty ActBecause this rule primarily clarifies existing regulations, there are nosignificant additional requirements or burdens placed upon small businessentities as a result of implementation of this rule. Therefore, the Departmenthas determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economiceffect on a substantial number of small entities and does not require aregulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5.U.S.C. 601 et seq.)Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection and recordkeeping requirements located at andSection;andSection;202.353, 210.352, and 210.354 of this rule have been approved by the Officeof Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearancenumbers 1010-0033 and 1010-0022.The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from \1/2\ to 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden,to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Mail Stop 632, MineralsManagement Service, 12203 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 22091; and theOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503.National Environmental Policy Act of 1969It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand a detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>30 CFR Part 202Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 206Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-Mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 210Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 212Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 7, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

Notwithstanding any other provisionsof this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage,are not arm's-length contracts. The MMS may require the lessee to certifythe claimed nature of ownership control. To be considered arm's-lengthfor any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of thisdefinition for the production month as well as when the contract was executed.For purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one personcontrols, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another person.For purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership ofthe voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership:(1) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;(2) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a rebuttable presumptionof control; and(3) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrolwhich MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, includingthe existence of interlocking directorates.``Audit'' means a review, conducted in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activitiesof lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuseson Federal geothermal leases.``BLM'' means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.``Byproduct'' means (1) any mineral or minerals (exclusive of oil, hydrocarbongas, and helium) which are found in solution or developed in associationwith geothermal fluids and which have a value of less than 75 per centumof the value of the geothermal energy or are not, because of quantity,quality, or technical difficulties in extraction and production, of sufficientvalue to warrant extraction and production by themselves, and (2) commerciallydemineralized water.``Byproduct recovery facility'' means the facility or facilities at whichbyproducts are placed in marketable condition.``Byproduct transportation allowance'' means an approved allowance forthe lessee's reasonable, actual costs, excluding gathering, incurred formoving byproducts, including commercially demineralized water, to a pointof sale or point of delivery off the lease, unit area, or communitizedarea.``Contract'' means any oral or written agreement, including amendmentsor revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by lawthat with due consideration creates an obligation.``Deduction'' means a subtraction used in the geothermal netback procedurefor determining the value of geothermal resources utilized by the lesseeto generate electricity. ``Transmission deduction'' means a deduction forthe lessee's reasonable actual costs incurred to wheel or transmit theelectricity from the lessee's powerplant to the purchaser's delivery point.``Generating deduction'' means a deduction for the lessee's reasonable,actual costs of generating plant tailgate electricity.``Delivered electricity'' means the amount of electricity in kilowatthoursdelivered to the purchaser.``Direct utilization'' means any process other than electrical generationin which the thermal energy of the geothermal resource is utilized, including,but not limited to, space heating, greenhouse operations, and industrialor agricultural process heat.``Field'' means the land surface vertically projected over a subsurfacegeothermal reservoir encompassing at least the outermost boundaries ofall geothermal accumulations know to be within that reservoir.

Gross proceeds also includes, but isnot limited to, reimbursements for production taxes and other taxes. Taxreimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee eventhough the Federal royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Moniesand other consideration, including the forms of consideration identifiedin this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitledbut which it does not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are alsopart of gross proceeds.``Lease'' means a geothermal lease issued under authority of the GeothermalSteam Act of 1970, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), unless the contextindicates otherwise.``Lessee'' means any person to whom the United States issues a geothermallease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royaltyor other payments required by the lease.

The value that the lessee reports for royalty purposes issubject to monitoring, review, and audit.(ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the contractreflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directlyor indirectly, from the buyer to the seller for the geothermal resource.If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, MMS may requirethat the geothermal resource sold pursuant to that contract be valued inaccordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value shall not be lessthan the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including any additionalconsideration received.(iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lesseepursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable valueof the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties,or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor tomarket the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor,MMS shall require the geothermal resource to be valued pursuant to paragraph(c) of this section, and notification provided to MMS in accordance withparagraph (d)(3) of this section. If MMS determines that the value maybe unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunityto provide written information justifying the lessee's value.(2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that the provisions in itsarm's-length contract include all of the consideration to be paid by thebuyer, either directly or indirectly, for the geothermal resource.(c)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section that aresold under a non-arm's-length contract or that are not subject to a salestransaction but are instead utilized directly by the lessee in its ownpowerplant for the generation and sale of electricity shall be determinedin accordance with the first applicable paragraph of the following paragraphs.(i) The weighted average of the gross proceeds paid or received by thelessee under its own arm's-length contracts for the purchase or sale ofsimilar quantities of like-quality geothermal resources in the same field;(ii) The value determined by the netback procedure described in paragraph(c)(2) of this section; or any other reasonable valuation method approvedby MMS.(2) Under the geothermal netback procedure, the lessee's reasonable actualcosts for the generation and transmission of electricity shall be deductedfrom the lessee's gross proceeds received for the sale of electricity todetermine the value of the geothermal resource. Transmission deductionsshall be determined pursuant to andSection; 206.353 of this subpart. Generatingdeductions shall be determined pursuant to andSection; 206.354 of this subpart.(3) Value determinations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject tothe notification requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.  (d)(1) The lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination ofroyalty value, particularly where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph(c) of this section and 30 CFR Part 212. Such data shall be subject toreview and audit and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different valueif it determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirementsof these regulations.  (2) Upon request, lessees shall make available to authorized MMS or Staterepresentatives, to the Office of the Inspector General of the Departmentof the Interior, or to other authorized persons any and all contracts forthe sale or other disposition of the lease production; contracts for thesale, generation, and/or transmission of electricity attributable to leaseproduction; and arm's-length sales and volume data for like-quality productionsold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the field asmay be necessary to support a value determination.  (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to paragraph(c) of this section. The notification shall be by letter to the MMS AssociateDirector for Royalty Management or his/her designee. The letter shall identifythe valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of theprocedure to be followed. The notification required by this paragraph isa one-time notification due no later than the end of the month followingthe month the lessee first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using avaluation method authorized by paragraph (c) of this section.  (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined value,the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty payments madebased upon the value it has used and the royalty payments that are duebased upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall also pay intereston that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.302. If the lessee isentitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the taking of thatcredit.  (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that event,the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and may usethat method in determining value, for royalty purposes, until MMS issuesits decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to itsproposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon thelessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary. Inmaking a value determination, MMS may use any of the valuation criteriaconsistent with this subpart. That determination shall remain effectivefor the period stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, thelessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (e) of thissection.  (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstancesshall the value of production for royalty purposes be less than the grossproceeds accruing to the lessee where geothermal resources are sold pursuantto arm's-length or non-arm's-length contracts.  (h) The lessee is required to place geothermal resources in marketablecondition and to deliver geothermal resources to the powerplant at no costto the Federal lessor. Where the value established pursuant to this sectionis determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value shall be increasedto the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser,or any other person, is providing certain services the cost of which ordinarilyis the responsibility of the lessee to place the geothermal resource inmarketable condition or deliver it to the powerplant.  (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receivethrough legally enforceable claims under its contract. If there is no contractrevision or amendment, and the lessee fails to take proper or timely actionto receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it must pay royaltyat a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisionsor amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to the contract.If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase or benefitallowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takesreasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance,the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or considerationresulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received.This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royaltypayment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in wholeor in part or timely, for a quantity of geothermal resources.  (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary,no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that resultsin a redetermination by MMS of value under this section shall be consideredfinal or binding as against the Federal Government or its beneficiariesuntil the audit period is formally closed.  (k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support value determinationsis exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be privileged,confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a confidentialmanner in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

The transmission deduction consists of either or bothof two components: Transmission-line costs as determined pursuant to paragraph(b) of this section and wheeling costs if the electricity is transmittedacross a third-party's transmission line under an arm's-length wheelingagreement. Transmission deductions are subject to the limitation prescribedin paragraph (c) of this section.  (b)(1) Transmission-line costs are based on the lessee's actual costs associatedwith the construction and operation of a transmission line. The monthlytransmission-line cost component of the transmission deduction is determinedby multiplying the annual transmission-line cost rate (in dollars per kilowatthour)by the amount of electricity delivered for the reporting month. The transmission-linecost rate is redetermined annually at the beginning of the month markingthe anniversary in which the transmission line was placed into service,or, at the lessee's option, at a time concurrent with the beginning ofthe lessee's annual corporate accounting period. After a deduction periodis chosen, the lessee may not later elect to use a different deductionperiod without MMS approval; transmission deduction periods must coincidewith generating deduction periods.  (2) Allowable transmission-line costs include operating and maintenanceexpenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciatedcapital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section,or a cost equal to the capital investment in the transmission line multipliedby a rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of thissection. Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for fixed assets,including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment (butexcluding real estate purchases) that are an integral part of the transmissionline.  (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering;operations labor; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies;and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expenses thatthe lessee can document.  (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transmissionline; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocableand attributable maintenance expenses that the lessee can document.   (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation andmaintenance of the transmission line is an allowable expense. State andFederal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties,are not allowable expenses.  (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee mayuse either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital investment,or a return on capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use eithermethod, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternativewithout approval of MMS.  (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line depreciationmethod based on the expected life of the geothermal project, usually theterm of the electricity sales contract unless the lessee can show otherwise.A change in ownership of a transmission line shall not alter the depreciationschedule established by the original lessee-owner for purposes of computingtransmission-line costs. With or without a change in ownership, a transmissionline shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciatedbelow a reasonable salvage value. The rate of return used to compute thereturn on undepreciated capital investment shall be determined pursuantto paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.  (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost shall bethe amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the transmissionline multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph(b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation.This alternative shall apply only to transmission lines first placed inservice on or after March 1, 1988.  (v) The rate of return shall be 1.5 times the industrial rate associatedwith Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be 1.5 timesthe monthly average rate as published in <T3>Standard and Poor's Bond Guide</T3> for the first month of the annualoperating period for which the deduction is applicable and shall be effectiveduring the following operating year. The rate shall be redetermined annuallyat the beginning of the month marking the service anniversary of the transmissionline or the beginning of the lessee's annual corporate accounting period,whichever is chosen for determination of the transmission deduction.  (3) Transmission-line cost rates, determined annually, are computed bydividing the sum of the operating, maintenance, overhead, and capital costsby the annual amount of delivered electricity.  (4) For new transmission lines, the lessee's costs for the first year ofoperation shall be based on estimated expenses (including overhead) foroperating and maintaining the transmission line. For subsequent years ofoperations, the transmission-line costs shall be based on the lessee'sactual operating and maintenance expenses for the previous year plus orminus any adjustments that are based on the lessee's knowledge of decreasesor increases that will affect the deduction.  (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, transmissiondeductions (transmission-line costs and/or wheeling costs) shall not exceed50 percent of the lessee's gross proceeds received for the sale of electricity. (2) Upon request by the lessee, MMS may approve a transmission deductionin excess of the limit prescribed by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.The lessee must demonstrate that the transmission-line and/or wheelingcosts in excess of the limit are reasonable, actual, and necessary. Anapplication for exception shall contain all relevant and supporting documentationnecessary for MMS to make a determination. Under no circumstances shallthe value of the geothermal resource be reduced to zero.  (d)(1) If the actual transmission deduction, as determined at the end ofthe annual reporting period, is less than the amount the lessee estimatedand used in the netback procedure during the reporting period, the lesseeshall be required to pay additional royalties retroactive to the firstmonth of the reporting period, plus interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR218.302. If the actual transmission deduction is greater than the amountapplied in the netback calculation, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit. (2) Lessees must submit corrected Forms MMS-2014 to reflect adjustmentsto royalty payments in accordance with instructions provided by MMS.  (e)(1) All transmission deductions are subject to review, audit, and adjustment.When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its estimatedor actual transmission deduction and adjust royalty values accordingly. (2) The lessee must maintain all data and records, including wheeling andother transmission-related agreements, supporting its transmission deductionpursuant to 30 CFR Part 212. These data and records must be made availableto MMS and other authorized personnel upon request, and shall be maintainedin a confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulationspursuant to andSection; 206.352 of this subpart.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.354  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determination of generating deductions.  </ITAG>(a) Where the value of geothermal energy is determined by the geothermalnetback procedure pursuant to andSection; 206.352(c)(1)(ii) of this subpart,that value shall be determined by deducting the lessee's reasonable actualcosts incurred to generate electricity from the plant tailgate value ofthe electricity (usually the transmission-reduced value of the deliveredelectricity). Generating deductions are subject to the limitation prescribedin paragraph (c) of this section.  (b)(1) Generating costs are based on the lessee's actual annual costs associatedwith the construction and operation of a geothermal powerplant. The monthlygenerating deduction is determined by multiplying the annual generatingcost rate (in dollars per kilowatthour) by the amount of plant tailgateelectricity measured (or computed) for the reporting month. The generatingcost rate is determined from the annual amount of generated electricityand is redetermined annually at the beginning of the month marking theanniversary in which the powerplant was placed into service or, at thelessee's option, at a time concurrent with the beginning of the lessee'sannual corporate accounting period. After a deduction period is chosen,the lessee may not later elect to use a different deduction period withoutMMS approval; generating deduction periods must coincide with transmissiondeduction periods.  (2) Allowable generating costs include operating and maintenance expenses,overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capitalinvestment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section,or a cost equal to the capital investment in the powerplant multipliedby a rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of thissection. Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for fixed assets,including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment (butexcluding real estate purchases) that are an integral part of the powerplant.The costs of hydrogen sulfide abatement facilities and other facilitiesto mitigate environmental hazards and the costs of gathering systems andother production-related facilities are not allowed.  (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering;operations labor; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies;auxiliary fuel and/or utilities used to operate the powerplant during downtime; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expensethat the lessee can document.  (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the powerplant;maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocableand attributable maintenance expenses that the lessee can document. (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation andmaintenance of the powerplant is an allowable expense. State and Federalincome taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not allowableexpenses.(iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee mayuse either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital investment,or a return on capital investment.

A change in ownership of a powerplant shallnot alter the depreciation schedule established by the original lessee-ownerfor computing the generating costs. With or without a change in ownership,a powerplant shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciatedbelow a reasonable salvage value. The rate of return used to compute thereturn on undepreciated capital investment shall be determined pursuantto paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.(B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost shall bethe amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the powerplantmultiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v)of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. Thisalternative shall apply only to powerplants first placed in service onor after March 1, 1988.(v) The rate of return shall be 1.5 times the industrial rate associatedwith Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be 1.5 timesthe monthly average rate as published in <T3>Standard and Poor's Bond Guide </T3>for the first month of the annualoperating period for which the deduction is applicable and shall be effectiveduring the following operating year. The rate shall be redetermined annuallyat the beginning of the month marking the service anniversary of the powerplantor the beginning of the lessee's annual corporate accounting period, whicheveris chosen for determination of the generating deduction.(3) Generating cost rates, determined annually, are computed by dividingthe sum of the operating, maintenance, overhead, and capital costs by theannual amount of generated electricity.(4) For new powerplants, the lessee's generating costs for the first yearof operation shall be based on estimated expenses (including overhead)for operating and maintaining the powerplant. For subsequent years of operations,the generating costs shall be based on the lessee's actual operating andmaintenance expenses for the previous year plus or minus any adjustmentsthat are based on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases thatwill affect the deduction.(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, generatingdeductions shall not exceed 66\2/3\ percent of the plant tailgate valueof electricity.(2) Upon request by the lessee, MMS may approve a generating deductionin excess of the limit prescribed by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.The lessee must demonstrate that the generating costs in excess of thelimit are reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for exceptionshall contain all relevant and supporting documentation necessary for MMSto make a decision. Under no circumstances shall the value of the geothermalresource be reduced to zero.(d)(1) If the actual generating deduction, as determined at the end ofthe annual reporting period, is less than the amount of the lessee estimatedand used in the netback procedure during the reporting period, the lesseeshall be required to pay additional royalties due, retroactive to the firstmonth of the reporting period, plus interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR218.302.

The notification shall be by letter to MMS AssociateDirector for Royalty Management or his/her designee. The letter shall identifythe valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of theprocedure to be followed. The notification required by this paragraph isa one-time notification due no later than the end of the month followingthe month the lessee first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using avaluation method authorized by paragraph (c) of this section.  (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined value,the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty payments madebased upon the value it has used and the royalty payments that are duebased upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall also pay interestcomputed on that difference pursuant to 30 CFR 218.302. If the lessee isentitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the taking of thatcredit.

Absent contractrevision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely actionto receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled it must pay royaltyat a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisionsor amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-lengthcontract. If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase orbenefit allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lesseetakes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance,the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or considerationresulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received.This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royaltypayment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in wholeor on part or timely, for a quantity of geothermal resources.

(b) <T3>Non-arm's-length or no contract.</T3> (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-lengthcontract or has no contract, including those situations where the lesseeperforms transportation services for itself, the byproduct transportationallowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. Allbyproduct transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length orno-contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possiblefuture adjustment. Prior MMS approval of byproduct transportation alowancesis not required for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations. (2) The byproduct transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contractsituations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for transportationduring the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses,overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capitalinvestment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section,or a cost equal to the capital investment in the transportation systemmultiplied by the rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for fixedassets, including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment(but excluding real estate purchases), that are an integral part of thetransportation system. (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering;operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes;rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operatingexpenses that the lessee can document. (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportationsystem; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directlyallocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the lessee can document.(iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenanceof the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federalincome taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, arenot allowable expenses. (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee mayuse either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section. After a lesseehas elected to use either method for a transportation system, the lesseemay not later elect to change to the other alternative. (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line depreciationmethod based on, as appropriate, either the life of equipment or the lifeof the geothermal project that the transportation system services. Afteran election is made, the lessee may not change methods. A change in ownershipof a transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule establishedby the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation.With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system shall bedepreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonablesalvage value. The rate of return used to compute the return on undepreciatedcapital investment shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v)of this section. (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost shall bethe amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the transportationsystem multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph(b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation.(v) The rate of return shall be 1.5 times the industrial rate associatedwith Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be 1.5 timesthe monthly average as published in <T3>Standard and Poor's Bond Guide</T3> for the first month of the reportingperiod for which the allowance is applicable and shall be effective duringthe reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined at the beginning ofeach subsequent transportation allowance reporting period.  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 210_FORMS AND REPORTS </ITAG>1.
