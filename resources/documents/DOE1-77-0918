The scale ofmost geothermal developments (of the order of one to ten million dollars,or more) ensures that the time constant for change is quite large, dampingout the rapid fluctuations seen in some other energy resource developmentsin response to short-term changes in oil prices. The effect is that themomentum of development has tended to carry through over the past coupleof years in spite of the current position of energy over-supply. Bothpublic and private sector projects have been affected, and some may takea decade or more to reactivate once energy prices start to rise again.</TEXT></DOC>
