Thepurchase price wasn't disclosed.   Andrew Jeacock, a spokesman for the British company, saidthe acquisition will make Royal Ordnance &quot;the dominant forcein the European small arms market, at least in quality andnumbers.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Heckler andamp; Koch, which makes the G-3 assault rifles used bythe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has been in financialdifficulties for some months, and hadn't been able to pay its2,000 workers in December, according to German news reports.The German company agreed late last year to be taken over byGiat Industries, but the state-owned French company'sdirectors called the move off last week.   Heckler andamp; Koch has pinned its hopes on a new assaultrifle, the G-11. The new small-bore rifle is the successor tothe G-3, which has been in service for 40 years. Thedifficulties of the once privately held company stem from theGerman government's decision to postpone an order for theG-11. Heckler andamp; Koch had hoped to sell 500,000 of the riflesto the German military over the next two decades, giving thecontract a final value of over one billion marks ($648.3million).   Mr. Jeacock said the German army's interest in the G-11 isstill alive. &quot;It's probably the first technical advance insmall arms for 15 years,&quot; he said.   Mr. Jeacock said Heckler andamp; Koch's sales for 1990 were theequivalent of around #110 million ($209.9 million). He didn'tprovide comparable earnings data. &quot;Perhaps their businessacumen hasn't been as good as their technical success,&quot;Jeacock said, adding that &quot;we're going to make the companysucceed.&quot;   London stock analysts were positive about the move.&quot;Heckler andamp; Koch have had a tough time recently, and this willgive them a chance to sort things out,&quot; said Chris Tarry ofKleinwort Benson Securities.</TEXT></DOC>
