Otto Kerner,who was a U.S. appellate court judge at the time of his convictionon bribery, conspiracy and fraud charges in February 1983.   In another investigation, more than 100 suburban officials _mayors, supervisors, commissioners, police officers _ were indictedon corruption charges.   ``What we learned in those years was that a lot of theseactivities were interrelated. In other words, that one person whowas paying off one official in one town also was paying off otherofficials in other towns,'' Valukas says. ``So we developed anintelligence base and leads for all these other investigations.''   With each round of indictments and convictions, federalprosecutors and agents grew more aggressive, Valukas says.   They began plotting elaborate stings, using undercover agentswearing hidden tape recorders and microphones, creating their owncrooked companies to bribe public officials, even staging phonycrimes.   In late 1978 and early 1979, the feds began planning what wouldbecome one of the largest undercover investigations in the historyof the FBI, code-named Greylord, a horse's name picked from aracing sheet by an agent, Walsh said.   ``The Greylord case was very difficult from a legal standpointbecause we had to allow undercover agents to essentially commitstate crimes and allow undercover agents to perjure themselves,''Walsh says.   ``You're talking about allowing agents to get up in state courtand swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth andthen lie about their name and age and occupation.''   In the probe's undercover phase, 1980-83, the agents found thatareas of Cook County's court system rivaled the fictionalportrayals of justice on such popular television shows as ``HillStreet Blues.''   Take the case of Raymond Sodini, a judge since 1971 who pleadedguilty to accepting $6,000 in bribes and was sentenced to eightyears in prison in May 1987.   He presided over a smelly, cramped courtroom on the 11th floorabove police headquarters on the city's South Side that became _ inthe words of the federal judge who sentenced him _ ``a cesspool ofcorruption.''   Undercover agents found that five lawyers had formed whatprosecutors called a ``hustlers' bribery club.'' They bribed Sodinifor permission to openly solicit business from criminal defendantsstepping off the elevators _ an unethical practice known ashustling in the legal trade, evidence showed.   The lawyers also paid off court clerks and sheriff's deputies tosteer unrepresented clients to them. The judge once had to mediatea dispute among the clerks and deputies over who was getting themost bribes, testimony at his trial showed.   Sodini pocketed more than $1,000 a month in payoffs from 1980 to'83, federal prosecutors contended at his trial.   ``There has been testimony that this sort of thing had beengoing on for decades,'' Valukas says. ``And the reason it went onfor decades is that no one ever talked about it. The systemcondoned it.''   One lawyer, Edward Nydam, kept meticulous records of his payoffsto judges and court personnel from 1979 to '83 and read them aloudin court during Sodini's trial. He listed the amounts next toinitials like ``BM'' for bagman or ``MF'' for ``Moonface,'' thenickname of one judge.   Patrick Ryan, a former sheriff's deputy and drinking buddy ofSodini's, testified that the judge twice called in to say he'd beenout late drinking the night before and wouldn't make the 8 a.m.court call for winos and vagrants.   Sodini instructed Ryan to tell the court sergeant to put on thejudge's robes and handle the ``bum'' call. Later in the day, Sodinisigned the orders entered by the court sergeant, Ryan testified.   While Greylord uncovered outlandish behavior, the Phocus andLantern investigations into licensing, zoning and purchasing fraudturned up classic Chicago-style public corruption, Valukas says.   He points to the case of Consumers Tire andamp; Supply Co.   Fred Taich, who owned the company in 1982-86, routinely bribed10 city purchasing officers to win more than $2 million incontracts to sell tires, tools and janitorial supplies to Chicago'spark district, transit agency and five city departments, evidenceat his trial showed.   After paying the bribes, Taich often submitted inflated bills orphony invoices for equipment the city never bought to recover thecost of the payoffs, Valukas says.   ``But this being Chicago, he wouldn't just make up anon-existent invoice, he would include tax _ for say $25,000 worthof non-existent tires _ and then add in a profit. That's tax andprofit on the bribe,'' Valukas says.   Taich pleaded guilty in May to mail fraud and tax evasion. Hewas sentenced to two years in prison, fined $100,000 and ordered torepay $131,000 to the city.   Greylord has wrought significant reforms in the county courts.   ``I think the system is very, very healthy today,'' ChiefCircuit Judge Harry Comerford says. ``I think what has happened isthe bad seeds that had integrated themselves into the system havebeen removed.''   The special commission appointed by Comerford in the wake ofGreylord, has recommended 195 reforms and many already have beenadopted, says lawyer Jerold Solovy, the commission's chairman.   The Chicago Police Department also has cleaned house since theearly 1970s and its internal affairs department now works closelywith federal agents and prosecutors.   The federal investigations, indictments and convictions of CityHall corruption prompted the City Council in 1987 to enact thefirst ethics laws in Chicago's history, says Simpson, the politicalscience professor. Several civic groups formed a coalition to fightcorruption.   It can't be done simply by passing a law, Simpson says.   ``There's been a certain perverse pride among Chicagoans in thescandals and as long as that didn't seem to affect the operationsof government _ as long as the garbage was picked up _ it wasviewed as sort of a form of entertainment,'' Simpson says.   Valukas says: ``We're making inroads but I still think we have along way to go. Although I never like to predict what the grandjury will do, you can expect that between now and the end of theyear corruption will be a topic of news coming out of the U.S.Attorney's office. It is fertile ground _ unfortunately.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
