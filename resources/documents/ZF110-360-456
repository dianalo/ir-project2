(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THREE CHEERS FOR THREE NEW MACSandM;No more excuses.andP;  The final barrier to owning a Mac -- cost -- has beenlifted.andP;  On October 15, Apple introduced thre new low-cost Macs: theMacintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi.andP;  At the sametime, it retired three of the best-selling Macs ever -- the Plus, the SE, andthe IIcx -- and demoted the IIx to special-order status.andP;  The hallmarks ofthe revised Mac lineup are power and affordability.andP;  The bottom line: Macscan compete across the full desktop spectrum -- against low-cost IBM PCclones and powerful workstations -- and they can compete in terms of bothperformance and price.andM;Seven Macintosh computers remain, one for every need and budget (see Table1).andP;  You can pick up a Classic for less than $1,000 dollars, or you can spendten times as much for a top-of-the-line IIfx.andP;  The color LC gives you thepower of a Mac II for the price of an SE, and for $599, you can plug in a new12-inch color monitor.andP;  The IIsi provides 68030-class performance for around$3,700, and the IIci has dropped in price by up to $1,500.andP;  The remainingfamily members, the Mac Portable and the SE/30, are unchanged in bothfeatures and price -- for now (see the &quot;On the Horizon&quot; sidebar).andM;The three new Macs are only part of the story: Apple also announced newadd-in cards, new monitors, a new keyboard, new RAM-expansion kits, and newSystem software.andP;  Apple invited a team of MacUser editors and Labs staff toinvestigate this outpouring of new technology at its secret new-productstronghold.andP;  There we tested, disassembled, and inspected each new machineand accessory and then grilled their creators about hidden strengths andweaknesses.andP;  (Our analysis of the new products is based on evaluations ofpreproduction unitsandgt; details that were still unresolved at press time arenoted.)andM;Our testing sought not only technical details but also answers to some largerquestions.andP;  What about the challenge of Microsoft Windows 3.0?andP;  Can low-costMacs beat back the advancing horde of cheap DOS clones?andP;  And will Applemaintain its deserved reputation as the leader in innovative, truy personalcomputing?andP;  Although the final results are elusive, we did identify thebeneficiary of Apple's latest offerings.andP;  It's you.andM;More Than Just InexpensiveandM;The Classic, LC, and IIsi are not just new Macs at attractive prices.andP;  The LCand IIsi, for example, are pioneers in a new era in personal computing thatfeatures the integration of the human voice.andP;  Both include built-indigital-recording capability and an attractive omnidirectional microphone(see Figure 1).andP;  Thirdparty developers are rushing to provide messaging,file-annotation, and voice-recognition applications to bring sound to everyMac user's desktop and network (see the &quot;Bandwagon&quot; sidebar).andM;All three new Macs include built-in video circuitry.andP;  The Classic -- thesuccessor to the Plus and the SE -- continues the compact-Mac tradition withits built-in 9-inch monochrome monitor.andP;  The LC and IIsi follow the lead ofthe IIci and include on-board video circuitry to drive a variety of popularMac monitors.andP;  In the new Mac family, only the flagship IIfx still requiresan additional video card before a monitor can be hooked up.andP;  (The MacPortable requires a third-party adapter to drive an external video display).andM;It's a good thing that video cards aren't required for these new machines,because each follows Apple's original Mac philosophy of providing few or noexpansion options (see Figure 2).andP;  The Classic, for example, has no expansionslot -- although its unusual RAM configuration should allow enterprisingdevelopers to develop interfaces for large-screen monitors.andP;  The LC and IIsieach include a PDS (processor direct slot), waiting for third-party cards.andO;Only the IIsi offers a NuBus slot -- and only as an extra-cost option.andO;That's the bad news.andM;The good news is that the LC's PDS accepts a new card that will warm theheart of educators and Apple II enthusiasts: the Macintosh LC Apple IIeOption Card (see Figure 3).andP;  This eight-chip beauty turns the LC into a fullyfunctional Apple IIe, complete with connections for a 5.25-inch disk driveand joystick (see the &quot;Apple-IIe-in-a-Mac&quot; sidebar).andP;  But more on slots andcards in a moment.andP;  First, let's meet each new Mac.andM;Low Cost, High ValueandM;The Macintosh Classic is the perfect machine for users who don't require lotsof muscle.andP;  If your work consists of processing words, telecommunicating, orusing a simple spreadsheet program -- and you're willing to trade performancefor savings -- you don't need a Mac more powerful than the confidently namedClassic (see the &quot;$1,000,000 Name&quot; sidebar).andP;  If you use a IIci or IIcx atwork and you want to tweak that sales-report spreadsheet at home, this may bethe Mac for you -- no more staying late at the office because you can'tafford a Mac for home.andP;  although the Classic doesn't give you the microphoneand sound-recording capability of the LC and IIsi, third-party vendors suchas Farallon and Articulate Systems can provide you with the low-cost hardwareand software you'll need to take advantage of the coming age of sound input.andM;For some time, careful shoppers have been able to pick up a Mac Plus for lessthan $1,000.andP;  With the introduction of the Classic, the three-digit Mac isnow official.andP;  With 1 megabyte of RAM and a 1.4-megabyte floppy-disk drive,the Classic sells for one dollar less than a thousand -- and street pricesshould be substantially less than those of even the best Plus bargains.andM;But don't think of the $999 Classic simply as a lower-priced Plus.andP;  Whenequipped with 1 megabyte of RAM and an FDHD 1.4-megabyte floppy-disk drive --now officially named the SuperDrive -- it's actually a repackaged SE with 95percent of the SE's performance (see Figure 4) at 39 percent of its price.andO;Or you can load up your Classic with 2 megabytes of RAM and a 40-megabyteinternal hard-disk drive for $1,499 -- that's more than $1,800 less than anequivalently equipped SE]andM;Like the SE, the Classic includes an ADB port to which you can connect amouse, the newly redesigned Macintosh keyboard, and other input devices (seeFigure 5).andP;  Unlike the SE (and all the other members of the Mac family exceptthe Portable), the Classic -- along with the LC and IIsi -- has only one ADBport, so you must attach your mouse to your keyboard.andP;  Our editors andtechnicians were divided about the new keyboard -- its soft touch was judgedideal by some and mushy by others.andP;  Also unlike the SE, the Classic has noPDS or on-board SIMM slots for RAM expansion.andP;  Any expansion cards -- RAM orothers -- must use the Classic's unique (and, at press time, unnamed)system-memory slot.andP;  We know of at least two developers -- Computer Care andLapis (see the &quot;Bandwagon&quot; sidebar) -- that have teamed up to supply afull-page display/video-RAM card for this slot.andP;  Computer Care is alsodeveloping two RAM cards: one incorporating a RAM disk along with systemmemory and the other supplying only additional system memory.andM;With the 2-megabyte Classic configuration, Apple provides a small card thatcan occupy the as yet unnamed system-memory slot.andP;  This card contains anadditional 1 megabyte of RAM and two standard SIMM lots.andP;  Slip two 1-megabyte150-nanosecond SIMMs (the same speed as the SIMMs used in the Plus and SE)into these SIMM slots, and you reach the Classic's limit of 4 megabytes ofRAM.andP;  If you get a 1-megabyte Classic, you'll probably want to buy theoptional memory card, because a 1-megabyte Classic doesn't have enough RAM torun Apple's upcoming System 7.0.andP;  A 1-megabyte RAM ceiling also makes itessentially impossible to do any useful work when you're running MultiFinder.andM;The Classic's power supply has been redesigned for more reliability than thatin the SE or Plus.andP;  The redesign has introduced one minor deficiency,however: The new power supply can't handle a big power surge just as themachine is starting up.andP;  As a result, internal hard-disk drives are forced towait about a second before they turn on.andP;  This delay will be imperceptible tousers, but third-party internal drives for the Classic will be in limitedsupply until hard-drive vendors have redesigned their drives to include adelay circuit.andM;Also missing is a hard-drive-indicator light on the Classic's front panel,although some hard-disk utilities (Norton Utilities for the Macintosh andSilverlining, among others) supply on-screen indicators -- which you can turnoff if you find them distracting.andP;  And while we're talking picky details, theClassic's 9-inch monochrome display has no external brightness knob, as didthe displays of the SE and Plus, which it replaces.andP;  Display brightness iscontrolled by a cdev -- a &quot;feature&quot; not seen since the venerable Lisa.andM;Low-Cost ColorandM;The next new Apple offering we consider here, the Macintosh LC, is the idealmass-market office machine -- and its Apple IIe Option Card makes it noslouch in the K - 12 (kindergarten through high school) market either.andP;  Ifyou need color on your desktop and don't require the power of a high-endIIsi, IIci, or IIfx, the LC is the machine for you.andP;  And if you're acorporate volume buyer looking for a way to forever liberate your officestaff from IBM Selectrics while giving them the power to -- dare we say it --be their best, buy 'em each an LC, and you'll be an instant hero.andM;The LC is the real showstopper of the new CPUs -- a very versatile machine(see Figure 6).andP;  With a 16-megahertz 68020 microprocessor and on-board video,it performs most day-to-day jobs as well as its 68020 ancestor, the Mac II,did--even though the LC doesn't include the Mac II's number-crunching FPU(floating-point unit) math coprocessor.andP;  The LC's motherboard is extremelycompact and reliable, because of its low chip count and the addition of fournew custom chips that do the work of a whole handful of older chips.andP;  The LC-- without keyboard or monitor -- weighs just over 8.5 pounds, half theweight of the Mac Portable.andP;  With the addition of an LCD display (rumored tobe under development by a third-party vendor), the LC could become a very&quot;transportable&quot; alternative to the SE/30 and Mac Portable -- and unlike withthe Portable, you can hook the LC up to a color monitor when you get to yourdestination.andM;Although it was announced along with the Classic and the IIsi, the LC willmiss the Christmas shopping season--it won't be on your dealer's shelvesuntil January 1991 (the other two machines are available immediately).andP;  Whenit appears, the LC will be available in only one configuration: with 2megabytes of RAM and a low-profile 40-megabyte hard-disk drive ($2,499).andP;  TheRAM is soldered onto the LC's motherboard, along with two SIMM sockets readyto accept either 1- or 4-megabyte 100-nanosecond SIMMs (256K SIMMs are notsupported on the LC).andP;  A pair of either-size SIMMs will bump you up to 4megabytes or 10 megabytes, respectively.andM;The LC supports the new 64-dpi 12&quot; RGB Display, the newly revitalized 76-dpi12&quot; Monochrome Display (see the &quot;New Low-Cost Monitors&quot; sidebar), and thefamiliar 69-dpi 13&quot; AppleColor High-Resolution RGB Display.andP;  On the lattertwo monitors, 640 x 480 pixels are displayed at up to 16 grays or colors,respectively -- a 4-bit pixel depth.andP;  The new, optional Macintosh LC 512KVRAM (video RAM) SIMM (around $200) will raise the ante to 8 bits (256 graysor colors) on either the 12-inch monochrome or 13-inch color display.andO;Apple's new Macintosh 12&quot; RGB Display beams 512 x 384 pixels in 8-bit coloronto a crisply focused screen without the optional VRAM SIMM.andP;  With the VRAMSIMM, the LC can display 16-bit color, providing subtle enough shading forall but the most demanding photo-retouching applications.andP;  The first 15 bitsof 16-bit color provide 32,768 colorsandgt; the 16th bit is reserved for the alphachannel, which is used by software developers.andM;We were disappointed to discover that the LC includes neither an FPU nor anMMU (memory-management unit).andP;  The lack of an FPU makes numbers crunch moreslowly, and without an MMU, the LC can't take advantage of System 7.0'svirtual-memory feature: the ability to use hard-disk space as temporary RAM.andO;Neither can the LC run A/UX -- maybe not a great limitation today but sure tobecome more important as Apple's UNIX operating system becomes more popular.andO;Not only are these important and powerful chips lacking but the motherboarddoesn't even offer empty sockets to enable you to add them later.andM;It's possible that enterprising third-party vendors will offer add-in cardsthat include an FPU or MMU for the LC's 96-pin PDS.andP;  This slot is a whole new68020-based PDS that -- as do all PDSs -- gives you access to all thenecessary microprocessor pins.andP;  The PDS also has some special wiring, such asa sound line that lets an internal modem send sounds to the LC's built-inspeaker.andP;  Any add-in card, however, is limited to about 3 x 5 inches andcan't draw more than 4 watts of power -- you won't see any power-hungry24-bit-video cards for the LC.andP;  However, you will definitely see networkcards (Apple is working on an inexpensive Ethernet card -- look for it in thespring of '91) and possibly 68030- or 68040-based accelerators.andP;  In addition,Apple has announced that third parties are working on token-ring and IBM 3270mainframe-terminal-emulation cards for the LC's PDS.andP;  Clearly, manufacturersbelieve that the LC will become a corporate network workhorse.andM;Little Big ManandM;At first glance, the Macintosh IIsi is the hardest new Mac to get excitedabout -- unless you like saving money.andP;  The IIsi is ideal for corporatebuyers who want to equip their staff with high-powered, expandable color Macsbut who can't convince their finance departments to spring for IIci's allaround.andP;  Although the 20-megahertz IIsi lagged noticeably behind the25-megahertz IIci in most of our testing, its overall speed was greater thanthat of the popular 16-megahertz IIcx that it's replacing.andP;  Also, it wassurprisingly fast in disk-intensive tasks -- faster even than a $10,000 IIfx.andO;(The IIfx's much-ballyhooed SCSI DMA feature, designed to speed updisk-intensive tasks, is not yet supported by System software--and don'texpect System 7.0 to help.)andM;The IIsi is essentially a repackaged SE/30 with a 20-megahertz 68030 insteadof the 16-megahertz chip, minus the monitor and FPU (although an FPU isoptional, unlike with the LC) and including a video port ready to accept acolor monitor (see Figure 7).andP;  Two configurations are available: 2 megabytesof RAM and a 40-megabyte hard drive ($3,769) or 5 megabytes of RAM and an80-megabyte hard drive ($4,569).andP;  One megabyte of RAM is soldered onto themotherboard, and either four 256K or four 1-megabyte SIMMs are included.andP;  TheIIsi can also accept 4-megabyte SIMMs, but only 16 of the resulting 17megabytes can be addressed by the Mac's current operating system.andP;  System 7.0and A/UX, however, can address up to 4 gigabytes (billions of bytes).andP;  Whileyou wait for System 7.0, you can use the leftover megabytes as a RAM disk.andO;Apple has also announced 512K and 2-megabyte SIMMs that it will sell in kitsof four SIMMs each.andP;  These kits will upgrade the IIsi to 3 megabytes or 9megabytes, respectively (the IIci can also use these new SIMMs).andP;  You can useany of your old SIMMs in the IIsi as long as they are rated at 100nanoseconds or faster.andM;The IIsi's motherboard is extremely compact, because of a low chip count andthe addition of a few new custom chips.andP;  A 20-megahertz 68882 FPU isavailable on either of two optional adapter cards -- one that adds anSE/30-style PDS and one that adds a standard NuBus slot.andP;  We expect the PDScard to cost about $100 and the NuBus version about $200.andP;  The slot on theIIsi's motherboard matches the SE/30 PDS pin for pin and has a generous15-watt power allocation -- more than enough to power the greediest24-bit-video card.andP;  Without the adapter card, however, add-on cards must bevery small in order to fit vertically in the chassis.andP;  Asante, one of manydevelopers that were expected to announce products on October 15, hasredesigned its Ethernet card to fit vertically in this slot.andP;  This $495 cardwill give you Ethernet and save you the cost of the adapter card -- butyou'll have to live without an FPU.andP;  When either the PDS or the NuBus adaptercard is used, add-in cards are held above and parallel to the motherboard,with cable access through a punch-out port at the rear of the IIsi.andM;The IIsi supports the same three Apple monitors the LC does, plus thecrystal-clear 15&quot; Macintosh Portrait Display.andP;  All three Apple 12-inchmonitors and the 13-inch monitor can display up to 256 colors or gray levels(an 8-bit pixel depth).andP;  The IIsi can drive the Apple Portrait Display at upto 16 levels of gray (4 bits).andP;  Unlike the LC, the IIsi has no optional VRAMSIMM that allows it to display 32,768 colors (16 bits) on the new 12&quot; RGBDisplay -- you'll have to use the PDS or NuBus option with a third-partyvideo card to step up to 16- or 24-bit color.andP;  Because Apple provides onlyone slot for expansion, you're stuck with Apple displays if you want to add anonvideo expansion card for Ethernet, SCSI acceleration, or other uses.andM;Cheap ChipsandM;It's not just marketing savvy that makes Apple offer these three new machinesat such reasonable prices.andP;  There's a lot of cost-cutting engineeringknow-how inside their sleek cases.andP;  In addition to the reduction in thenumber of expansion slots, less apparent changes have dramatically reducedproduction costs.andP;  For example, because no screws are used, the Mac LC andIIsi can be assembled from their snap-in subcomponents in less than 90seconds.andP;  But the biggest part of the economy story is in the logic boardsand the chips that they contain.andM;The Classic has no chips (read our lips).andP;  Every part on the SE logic boardis on the Classic board.andP;  The big difference is that parts on the SE boardare traditional, through-hole parts -- the little &quot;feet&quot; on each chip.andO;called leads, must be inserted through holes drilled into each board.andP;  Thenew machines take a giant step beyond this slow, expensive process by usingSMD (surface-mounted device) technology.andM;SMD parts (also used on the IIcx, IIci, and IIfx) don't have leads but aresoldered onto the board's surface.andP;  Because you don't have to drill holes inthe boards, SMD boards are cheaper to build.andP;  The absence of leads lets SMDchips (and other electronic parts) be very small, down to a tenth of an inchin size, and they can be used on both sides of a circuit board.andP;  All thisresults in smaller circuit boards.andP;  And smaller circuit boards mean cheapercircuit boards.andP;  SMD parts are also cheaper to put onto a board.andP;  You needpeople to insert the leads of a through-hole part into the little holes onthe board, but SMD parts can be attached to a board by industrial robots.andM;Also, the LC and IIsi have fewer chips than do previous Macs.andP;  Apple achivedthis by combining older custom chips into single new chips.andP;  For example, theLC and the IIsi have a new chip that combines the SCSI controller and theserial-port controller, which were previously on separate chips.andP;  There isalso a chip that Apple refers to as the Egret, which combines the parameterRAM, the ADB circuitry, and the real-time clock, among other things.andP;  Thiscombining of chips not only saves Apple money but it also provides peace ofmind for Mac users, because more integration -- fewer chips -- generallymeans better reliability.andM;The LC's logic board uses just 27 chips (not including resistors andcapacitors).andP;  Compare this silicon frugality with IBM's use of almost 100chips on its PS/255sx-- and Big Blue's machine doesn't contain on-boardvideo, networking, sound, or a SCSI interface]  If you're still notimpressed, remember: The Mac LC is $1,500 cheaper than the 55sx.andP;  Cuter too.andM;Systemic ChangesandM;Hidden in all the excitement about new hardware is Apple's release of newSystem software, version 6.0.6.andP;  All System-software revisions since 6.0.2have been billed as simple support releases for new Macs.andP;  System 6.0.6'spurpose isn't all that different, but the number of changes required tosupport the three new Macs is extensive.andM;Minor changes in 6.0.6 include a revision of Font/DA Mover, version 3.9,which claims to fix several previously undiscovered bugs as well asincompatibilities with MultiFinder.andP;  The upgraded LaserWriter driver, 6.0.2,now accommodates printing envelopes on the Apple Personal LaserWriter (youfeed them in on the left edge rather than in the center of the paper tray, asrequired by printers in the LaserWriter II series), and the old LaserWriterSC driver has been replaced by a new driver for the Personal LaserWriter SC.andM;The most significant change is the inclusion of a substantially upgradedversion of the Sound Input Manager, which was redesigned for System 7.0.andP;  Itis included in 6.0.6 to support the sound capabilities of the Macintosh LCand IIsi.andP;  The most obvious change for users is that the Sound cdev now letsthem select a sound-input device (usually the LC's or the IIsi's microphone)as well as set any of the device's options.andP;  Once you've selected an inputdevice, clicking on the Add button lets you record a sound directly to disk,using familiar tape-recorder-style controls (see Figure 8).andP;  You can thenname the sound and use it--as a system beep, for example.andM;The updated Sound Input Manager offers a broad range of new features, themost revolutionary being MACE: Macintosh Audio Compression and Expansion.andO;MACE can compress sound data by a ratio of 3:1 (300K of sound data compressesinto 100K) without loss of fidelity, or by a ratio of 6:1 by cutting thesampling frequency in half (more on this later).andP;  Compressed sound can beplayed back in real time on any Mac from the Plus to the IIfx -- as long asthe playback Mac is running System 6.0.6 or its System has been upgrade toinclude MACE.andM;Introducing SoundandM;The new sound-recording and sound-playbck abilities of the LC and IIsirepresent only one small step for technical innovation -- but one giant leapfor Mackind.andP;  Although the core technology has been available to Mac userssince Farallon's MacRecorder shipped in 1988, Apple's inclusion of 8-bitsound-digitizing hardware and software with these two new Macs is potentiallythe most significant interface development since the introduction of thegraphical interface on the original 128K Mac in January 1984.andM;If you're familiar with Farallon's MacRecorder or Articulate Systems' VoiceLink, then you already understand much of what Apple has done.andP;  An A/D(analog-to-digital) chip on the motherboard of the LC and IIsi digitizessounds in available RAM and lets you store the sounds to disk for subsequentplayback and modification, (for a more detailed discussion, see &quot;SoundAdvice,&quot; May '90, page 284).andM;How does a sound get converted from an analog wave into a digital sequence ofnumbers?andP;  The LC or IIsi samples the wave--instantaneously records it--atregular intervals and then creates a digital map of the wave's shape (see the&quot;How Sound Works&quot; sidebar).andP;  This map--which carries information thatdescribes the sound that produced it--can later be used to reconstruct theoriginal sound.andP;  The more frequently you sample the wave, the more accuratethat reconstruction will be -- but the larger your sound file will be.andM;RAM-based recording limits the length of recordings to a few minutes, even ifyou have lots of RAM and record at low-quality settings.andP;  Hard-diskrecording, which is not yet supported by software from Apple or Farallon,lets you record for longer and at higher resolutions.andP;  The best-known exampleof hard-disk recording is Digidesign's Audiomedia board (see review, October'90, page 55), which lets you record CD-quality audio at a cost of 10megabytes per minute.andP;  Articulate System' Voice Link, a voice digitizer withbuilt-in compression,includes a DA that also allows recording direct to diskandM;In the audiophile world, the sampling rates that Apple offers in the newSound cdev are far from the &quot;CD quality&quot; standard of 16 bits of informationsampled at 44 kilohertz (44,000 time per second) (see the &quot;Apple VersusApple&quot; sidebar).andP;  High-quality Macintosh audio options such as the Audiomediaboard are significant for specific users, much as 16-million-colorcapabilities are significant for specific users.andP;  These high-end optionsaren't really necessary for the applications, such as voice messaging andfile annotation, that Apple is hoping to see take hold in the generalMac-using public.andP;  For example, even though the telephone is a low-qualitysound device, you can still recognize voices and understand both what they'resaying and how they feel about saying it.andP;  You don't need to have the clarityof the latest Pavarotti CD to convey a message with a voice-mail system.andO;Apple hasn't shut the door on Pavarotti, though -- it has providedSystem-level software tools that can record at a full 44 kilohertz (althoughonly at 8-bit resolution).andP;  The new Sound Input Manager's capabilities willgive developers plenty of ways to exploit the new world of sound.andM;Sound SoftwareandM;When the original Sound Input Manager debuted with the Mac II, the practicalresult for most people was the ability to change their beep sound to Monkey,Boing, or Clink-Klank.andP;  The new, improved Sound Input Manager bears about asmuch resemblance to that rudimentary beginning as a IIfx does to the original128K Mac.andP;  With appropriate software, users can now record and playmultichannel sampled sounds from memory or from disk -- you can finallyexpect to hear some stereo output from Macs with stereo-output jacks (theIIsi, SE/30, IIci, and IIfx), provided developers write the necessaryapplications.andM;While you wait for this new software to appear, check out HyperCard 2.0'sAudio Palette (see Figure 8).andP;  This free tool lets you digitize, play back,and do simple editing of sounds from within HyperCard.andP;  HyperCard users whoremember the hassle of converting to and from HyperCard's native sound formatneedn't worry.andP;  All Mac sounds from now on will comply with AIFF (AudioInterchange File Format).andP;  Old HyperCard sounds can still play, but newsounds must be recorded in AIFF.andP;  If the Audio Palette doesn't meet yourneeds and you can't wait for the next generation of sound software, check outFarallon's SoundEdit.andM;Whether users will attach more than novelty value to sound input isuncertain.andP;  Software publishers, on the other hand, have already showninterest in exploiting the new technology.andP;  After all, now that MicrosoftWindows claims to have brought a true graphical user interface to the IBM PC,sound could become a key distinguishing feature of the Mac.andP;  Here are some ofthe initial uses you can expect to see for digitized sound on the Mac:andM;Electronic mail.andP;  Both CE Software and Microsoft have licensed technologyfrom Farallon that adds a voice option to their mail packages.andP;  Recordingyour mail messages is faster than typing--especially if you don't touch-type.andO;A less obvious advantage is the emotional shading that speaking a messageprovides -- for most people it's far easier to sound sarcastic, wry,orhumorous than it is to write it.andP;  Think how many ways you can say &quot;Way to go&quot;and how many more words would be required to make the same statementunambiguous in writing.andM;Sending and storing messages as voice mail is less efficient, however.andP;  Soundfiles get big in a hurry, and the better the sound quality or the longer themessage, the faster they grow and the slower your mail system will run.andO;Still, it would be a mistake to underestimate the appeal of voice mail.andM;Annotation.andP;  Expect to see voice annotation as a common feature of suchbread-and-butter applications as word processors and spreadsheet programs(it's already a standard feature of NeXT software).andP;  In the meantime,products such as Farallon's forthcoming DiskPaper will make it possible forpeople to annotate documents from applications that don't have a built-inprovision for sound annotations.andM;Voice recognition.andP;  Apple isn't introducing voice recognition just yet, butit's a logical next step.andP;  It's already happening with third-party productssuch as Articulate Systmes' Voice Navigator and MacSema's new Voice Express.andO;Once you've added software that can interpret digitized sounds--especiallythe human voice--the Mac interface gains an entirely new dimension.andP;  Speakingcommands is more natural, more intuitive, and faster than typing or clickingwith a mouse.andM;A New World You Can AffordandM;For years users have been begging Apple to release a low-priced Mac.andP;  Nowthere are three -- and they've been worth waiting for.andP;  All three Macs aregreat values and should strike fear into the hearts of the IBM PC-clonemakers whose only selling point is price.andP;  No longer can a corporationjustify saddling its staff with antiquated DOS machines -- Windows 3.0notwithstanding -- when a few dollars more can provide color, sound, SCSI,plug-and-play simplicity, crisp displays, cross-application interfaceconsistency, and the interapplication-communication promise of the upcomingSystem 7.0.andP;  And no longer will home-computer users be forced to cross theBig Blue line, when a Mac Classic is available at street prices well under$1,000.andP;  Small -- as in price -- is indeed beautiful.andM;On the HorizonandM;Any thoughtful, fact-filled analysis of Apple's activities is not completewithout a good dose of unsubstantiated speculation.andP;  Here's what they'retalking about on the street -- be it Wall Street or the boulevards of SiliconValley -- when talk turns to predictions of Apple's next round of productreleases.andM;Don't look for any new CPUs until the spring of 1991 at the earliest.andP;  At thetime, Appel may have a new pair of Mac portables to crow about.andP;  Thesesecond-generation portables will probably come in two flavors: cheap andlight or heavy and expensive.andP;  The evidence for the former comes in part fromApple's acquisition of technology from Outbound Systems.andP;  Although there wasnothing in that purchase that Apple couldn't have done alone, why build whenyou can buy?andP;  The &quot;Portable Jr.&quot; will probably weigh about 40 percent lessthan the current anchor-in-a-briefcase, and it won't be equipped with a fancyscreen -- a common backlit LCD like those used in DOS data buckets will bethe order of the day.andP;  And for those still financially stable enough, thefamiliar Mac Portable will remain just as heavy and expensive but it willhave backlit screen.andM;For llcx owners let out in the cold when the llci because the standard-bearerin the modular line, a reasonably priced llci-upgrade kit may becomeavailable.andP;  Some time in the summer, the first 68040 machines should maketheir appearance, but an upgrade kit for 68030 owners is unlikely.andM;Look for Ethernet to appear on the motherboard of machines from the low tothe high end (the only exception being the Classic).andP;  Also, the new Mac LCappears to be an ideal candidate to become Apple's first disklessworkstation.andP;  AppleMail, a system architecture for store-and-forwardmessaging (text, graphics, video, sound), will appear, most likely with asimple voice-and tex-messaging application built on top of it.andM;On the software side, Claris should begin shipping its first products forMicrosoft's Windows 3.0 operating system by early 1992 (a Win3 version ofFileMaker Pro is the most likely candidate).andP;  And while we're on the subjectof foreign markets, don't be surprised if Apple revives its interest instylus-driven computers in an effort to bolster its business in Asia.andM;The BandwagonandM;If you're excited about the three new low-cost Macs, imagine how ecstaticdevelopers are.andP;  If Apple's expectations of high-volume sales are sound,there will be a lot of money to be made by supplying new software,peripherals, and add-in cards for the new Macs.andP;  Third-party developers arereleasing a variety of products that either take advantage of newcapabilities such as sound or target special needs such as networking, memoryexpansion, or RAM caching.andM;For the Classic, Computer Care and Lapis will be jointly marketing a cardthat includes RAM and an interface for a large-screen monochrome monitor.andO;You will be able to use both the Classic display and that of the add-onmonitor simultaneously, and the board will supply an extra megabyte of memorywith SIMM sockets for 2 megabytes more -- just as Apple's board does.andO;Computer Care will also be offering two additional memory boards.andP;  The first(about $150) is a third-party version of the optional Apple memory-expansionboard.andP;  The second (about $199) is a board that will have additional SIMMsockets for adding a RAM disk.andM;For the IIsi, PSI Integration is offering a low-cost, flexible alternative toApplel's Macintosh LLsi 030 Direct Slot Adapter Card.andP;  Its SE/30 Bus Adaptorcard includes a 68030 PDS, a socket for an optional FPU, and a third socketfor PSI's $599 Cache-It] -- a 64K RAM-cache card.andP;  PSI has announced that theBus Adaptor will list for $99, but the company is thinking of lowering theprice to $69.andM;Many of the new products for the LC and IIsi are based on the new soundcapabilities of those machines, but if you want to start digitizing soundsand taking advantage of the new wave of sound software and you aren'tplanning to buy an LC or a IIci, you'll need a third-party digitizer.andO;Farallon's versatile MacRecorder, which comes bundled with SoundEditsoftware, is still a good value at $249.andP;  If you only want to even the scorewith LC and IIsi owners, you can opt for Farallon's less expensive VoiceDigitizer ($149), which has no audio-input jack or built-in level control.andM;Farallon no longer has the digitizer market to itself.andP;  Articulate Systems,the maker of Voice Navigator, recently introduced Voice Link ($269), a voicedigitizer with built-in compression and a accompanying DA that allowsdirect-to-disk recording (something SoundEdit doesn't do yet).andM;If you're handy with a soldering iron, you can donwload plans from Zmac for ado-it-yourself sound-input device that costs about $20 in parts (it's calledSID), and you'll also find some simple software for recording and very basicvoice recognition.andM;Because Apple has refrained from trying to provide much in the way of usersoftware tools for audio, anybody who's interested in exploring the fullcapabilities of digitized Mac sound will bou an editing application, such asFarallon's SoundEdit or Articulate Systms' Voice Link software.andP;  SoundEdit,which until now has shipped only with MacRecorder hardware, will soon beavailable separatelyandgt; the stand-alone software price was undetermined atpress time.andP;  The price of Voice Link software without the digitizing hardwarewas also undetermined, but it will be less than $100.andP;  For those who arelooking for more power, Passpott's Sound Apprentice ($295) is a full-featuredMIDI-capable editing environment that also supports input from musicsynthesizers.andM;Although powerful sound-editing software such as SoundEdit and SoundApprentice is fun (we haven't yet seen the Voice Link software), theseapplications probably do more than most business users will need.andP;  A newsoftware package from Farallon with broader application is DisPaper, whichlets you print pages from any application to disk for distribution to otherusers.andP;  Those users can then view or print the image without needing theoriginal application.andP;  If you've got a sound-capable Mac -- that is, an LC orIIsi or any Mac equipped with Farallon's MacRecorder or Articulate Systems'Voice Link -- DiskPaper also lets you add voice annotation to the document.andO;Any Mac user can play back the annotation.andM;Both CE Software and Microsoft have aldready added annotation capability totheir E-mail programs.andP;  Adding sound to E-mail messages greatly increasestheir file size, adding three-minute symphonic overtures to memos should notbe encouraged.andP;  QuickMail is more problematic than Microsoft Mail in thisrespect, because it sends a separate copy of your message to every singleaddressee over your network -- a good way to bring your server to a standtillif each of those messages occupies several hundred kilobytes (CE Softwaresays it's studying this problem).andP;  In addition, WordPerfect is planning toinclude voice-annotation capability in the E-mail module of its WordPerfectOffice collection of utilities.andM;Several major software developers have already started taking steps to addvoice annotation to new versions of popular business applications.andO;Ashton-Tate has announced that voice annotation will be included withupcoming versions of its FullWrite word processor and Full Impact spreadsheetprogram.andP;  Claris is showing a prototype for a similar feature in MacWrite II.andO;Others are sure to follow.andM;Voice recognition, which until now was an exotic technology for most Macusers, will be available to any LC oR IIsi owner who gets Voice Navigator/SW-- a new, software-only version of Articulate Systems' Voice Navigator IIsystem.andP;  (The original Voice Navigator won the MacUser 1989 Eddy award forMost Significant Hardware Product.)andP;  With this new version, the hardwarebecomes transparent, although you might want to invest in an ArticulateSystems' unidirectional Desktop Mike ($95), which not only looks smarter thanApple's omnidirectional microphone but is also better suited tovoice-recognition applications, especially in noisy offices.andM;Once you've seen how long it takes to move big sound files around on yournetwork, you'll be interested to hear that Asante has redesigned its SE/30Ethernet card so it will fit vertically in the IIsi.andP;  Buying the new cardwill save you the $100 that you would otherwise spend for an adapter card,although you'll have to live without an FPU math coprocessor.andM;Apple-lle-in-a-MacandM;With the October product annoucements, Apple is ready to add two moreoperating systems to the Mac's repertoire.andP;  With various software to hardwareadd-ons, the Mac can run IBM's PC-DOS, the UNIX and X Window systems found onworkstations, and even Microsoft Windows 3.0 for PCs.andP;  A new emulation boardto be released by Apple in March will allow a Mac to run DOS 3.3 and ProDOS8, respectively the earlier and current Apple IIe operating systems.andP;  This isespecially important for the school market (kindergarten through 12th grade),where Macs have been too expensive until now and where a large investment hasalready been made in Apple II software.andP;  There's only one catch: The boardworks only in the Mac LC, not in the low-end Classic.andM;The entire emulation board contains only eight intergrated-circuit chips,including the 6502 CPU, the same processor that powers the Apple IIe.andP;  Theboard can run at two clock speeds (1 megahertz or 2 megahertz), which areswitchable in software.andM;The card has one input with a Y connector that allows the simultaneous hookupof a joystick and a 5.25-inch floppy-disk drive.andP;  Accompanying software willallow an Apple II disk to mount on the Mac desktop, so you won't need AppleFile Exchange to copy Apple II files to your hard disk.andP;  Other software willlet you create a ProDOS partition on your Mac hard disk that will mount as aseparate volume.andM;To launch ProDOS, you double-click on an application icon on your Macdesktop.andP;  The Ile board takes over your entire screen rather than running ina separate window as do other foreign operating systems.andP;  This approach isintentional, so as not to confuse schoolchildren with issued of multipleoperating systems and interfaces.andP;  A cdev lets you move between the Mac andApple II environments, and you can quit to the Finder from an Apple IIapplication.andM;This emulation board will no doubt be compared to IBM's Apple II emulatorboard, which runs in the IBM PS/2 line of PCs.andP;  Not surprisingly, usersshould find Apple's board easier to use.andP;  In order to run Apple II files withIBM's board, users must first launch a utility that converts ProDOS files toPC-DOS files that look like ProDOS to the board.andP;  Apple's IIe board for theMac an run real ProDOS files.andP;  Although we haven't tested the new board, wedid watch it run the old Apple II game Raster Blaster -- a good sign, becausegames are tough test of compatibility.andM;A future release of Apple's board will also handle existing Apple Talknetworks with AppleShare file serving, which is used in many schools.andO;Pricing was not available at press time, but Apple indicated that theIIe-emulation board's retail cost would be in line with the LC's low pricetag.andM;Apple Versus AppleandM;Why hasn't Apple provided CD-quality sound-recording capability in its newMac?andP;  The NeXT machine supports full 16-bit, 44-kilohertz sound --high-quality audio matched by your CD player.andP;  Apple, however, limits its LCand Ilsi to 8-bit sound and provides a cdev that samples at a paltry 22kilohertz.andP;  Why the conservative approach?andP;  The answer might be found in thecourtroom, not in the developer's lab.andM;Way back in 1981, up-and-coming Apple Computer signed an agreement withthen-moribund Apple Corps, the Beatles' record company, promising not tomarket products &quot;for the recording or reproduction of sound or video or acomponent part of such a system.&quot;andP;  Last year, after tipped off by formerBeatle George Harrison, Apple Corps initiated legal action, charging thatApple Computer had violated this agreement when it introduced the Apple MIDIinterface and other audio technologies.andM;Believing that the best defense is a good offense.andP;  Apple Computer sued tohave Apple Corps' trademark revoked in West Germany, Japan, Sweden, and a fewother countries.andP;  A Bristih court ruled that Apple Corps was protected fromsuch actions.andM;At press time, the dispute between the two Apples was still unsettled, withthe trial scheduled to begin in late 1990.andP;  Regardless of how the lawsuitturns out, onlookers say that it has cast a pall over music and sounddevelopment at Apple--and may have kept CD-quality sound out of the new CPUs.andM;New Low-Cost MonitorsandM;October 15 was not only a great day for CPUs -- it also saw the introductionof a new color monitor and th revitalization of an old monochrome one.andO;First, the Macintosh LC, Apple's lowest-cost color unit, needed a companionlow-cost color display.andP;  Although the LC supports the AppleColorHigh-Resolution Monitor, few of us on a tight budget want to pay $999 forApple's finest.andP;  The new $599 12&quot; Macintosh RGB Display is a solid productthat can outperform many similarly priced monitors.andP;  Most high-end users willstill opt for the AppleColor, with its caviarlike price, but the rest of usno longer have to settle for cheap, low-performance third-party options.andM;Here are the facts: The 12&quot; Macintosh RGB Display is not a Trinitron.andP;  It is,however, a monitor with a fine-pitch, .28mm shadow-mask tube that looksbetter than any other shadow-mask low-price monitors we've seen.andP;  And itlists for $400 less than the appleColor does.andP;  As for screen resolution, it'sa 64-dpi display that shows 512 X 384 pixelsandgt; that's 12 percent more than theClassic screen but 36 percent less than the AppleColor has.andP;  The display hasa 60-hertz refresh rate, which may cause eyestrain for those who aresensitive to screen flicker.andP;  The basic LC and the Ilsi support this displayat 8 bits (256 colors).andP;  When it contains the optional Macintosh LC 512K VRAMSIMM, the LC can show 16-bit true color (32,768 colors, with the 16th bitreserved).andM;Apple's new Macintosh 12&quot; Monochrome Display does not have an etched screenas did the Macintosh High-Resolution Monochrome Monitor it replaces, so it'smuch sharper and has higher contrast.andP;  The previous model's etched screendrastically impaired contrast and sharpness, although its antiglareproperties were superior (see &quot;A Study in Black and White,&quot; april '90, page182, for a full discussion of monitor matters).andP;  The new display is pricedthe same at $399 and still shows 640 X 480 resolution with a flicker-freescreen-refresh rate of 67 hertz.andP;  The pixel density has been upped to 76 dpifrom 74 dpi, so things display a bit smaller than they did on the earlierunit.andP;  On the Macintosh Iici, the display shows 8 bits (256 grays)andgt; on theLC, it shows 4 bits (16 grays), or 8 bits (256 grays) with the optional VRAMSIMM.andM;The Bottom LineandM;For years we hoped for a low-cost Mac, and now Apple delivers three.andP;  notonly that, but it throws in a whole new technology--built-in digital soundrecording--two new monitors, and a cluster of new add-in option cards.andP;  Inour opinion, the wait was worth it--each new Mac is a great value.andM;The Macintosh Classic ($999 with 1 megabyte of RAM and a 1.4-megabyteSuperDrive, $1,499 with 2 megabytes of RAM and a 40-megabyte hard-disk drive)is a repackaged SE at a significant savings.andP;  In fact, you could buy two MacClassics, each with 2 megabytes of RAM and a 40-megabyte hard drive, for theprove of one similarly configured SE.andP;  that is, if Apple would sell you anSE--if, along with the venerable Plus and popular Ilcx, has been retired.andO;The Classic is perfect for first-time buyers or anyone who has a Mac at theoffice and hates to stay late to finish that never -ending report.andP;  IBMPC-clone makers should start looking for another line of work.andM;The Macintosh LC ($2,499) is the most interesting of the new Macs.andP;  In itslow-profile case are 2 megabytes of RAM, a 68020 microprocessor (as in theMac II), and a 1-inch-high 40-megabyte hard-disk drive.andP;  Apple offers a new12-inch 64-dpi color monitor for the LC, along with an add-in card thatemulates the Apple Ile (complete with joystick and 5.25-inchfloppy-disk-drive ports) and a soon-to-be-released Ethernet card.andP;  Put it alltogether, and you get a fully equipped color Mac in the low $3,000 range.andO;Both business and education users will love this one.andM;The final new kid on the block is the Macintosh Ilsi ($3,769 with 2 megabytesof RAM and a 40-megabytes hard-disk drive, $4,569 for 5 megabytes of RAM andan 80-megabyte hard-disk drive).andP;  This successor to the Ilcx outperforms itsancestor and costs $1,600 less.andP;  Considering that the Ilcx was the mostpopular Mac model, corporate buyers will be lining up to buy Ilsi's by theofficeful.andM;Rik Myslewski is a MacUser senior editor who couldn't have written thisreport witout Tony Bojorquez, Henry Bortman, Jim Bradbury, Andrew Elsner,Paul R. Freedman, Russ Ito, Steve Lipson, Bruce Mewhinney, Jeff Pittelkau,John Rizzo, Stephan Somogyl, A Mac Portable, and his father-in-law's boat.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
