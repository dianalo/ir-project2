<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-1061 </DOCNO><TEXT>A motor for driving air through a replaceable filter to the face of awearer of a protective helmet is supplied with power from a rechargeablebattery pack through a current regulator which is controlled to tendto maintain the motor current constant in spite of variations in thebattery voltage or the degree of clogging of the filter. The voltageacross the motor, measured by resistors can be used as a measure of thedegree of clogging of the filter to actuate an audible or visible alarmif the filter becomes too clogged. The voltage across the regulator measuredby resistors can be used as a measure of the voltage of the battery togive a visible or audible warning if the battery charge gets too low.The two different warnings can be distinguishable from one another.</TEXT></DOC>
