WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl met withSecretary of State James A. Baker III and suggested the compromisemove of producing new short-range NATO nuclear missiles but puttingoff their deployment.   The chancellor also said publicly for the first time Monday thatWest Germany wants a disarmament mandate built into NATO strategythat would scuttle deployment plans if progress is made on reducingthe Soviet advantage in conventional weapons.   Kohl faces stiff public opposition to deploying upgradedbattlefield nuclear missiles on West German soil.   During his meeting with Kohl on Monday, Baker appeared to softenU.S. demands that NATO endorse a deployment plan this spring.   The new U.S. secretary of state, on an eight-day tour of NATOcountries, said the two agreed during a ``very, very friendly'' talkto negotiate differences over the NATO plan to develop, produce anddeploy new missiles to replace the aging U.S.-made Lance missiles.   Kohl told reporters individual countries' decisions to make theshort-range missiles could be approved and contained in a NATOstrategy statement expected this spring, while the West Germandecision on whether to accept the new rockets could be made later.   His proposal would serve as a compromise between the U.S.position calling for endorsement of the modernization project at theNATO summit expected in May or June and the Bonn government'sreluctance to endorse a plan so widely opposed by its citizens.   Defense Ministry spokesman Wilfried Dunkel picked up the sametheme during a news conference Monday, noting that what Washingtondecides on production of the new missiles is its own business.   ``The national decision does not mean an anticipation of thealliance decision,'' Dunkel contended.   Baker said he was assured West Germany has not changed itscommitment to the project.   ``This was not a decision-taking meeting,'' Baker said. ``That isnot what we are here for. It did, I hope, clear up some of theconfusion.''   He said his meeting with Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher also covered what steps Bonn has taken to tighten exportcontrols following U.S. complaints that West German firms helpedLibya build a poison gas plant.   Baker said Kohl told him ``in no uncertain terms'' he plans towork out through further negotiations the Bonn government'sdifferences with Washington over upgrading the Lance missiles.   The Lance system includes 88 launchers and about 700 missileswith a range of 75 miles. It is scheduled for replacement after 1995with rockets capable of reaching targets 320 miles away. Seventy-sixlaunchers are in West Germany, the remainder in Italy.   Before meeting Baker, Kohl restated to reporters his desire thatthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization delay approving the missilereplacement project until 1991 or 1992.   By then, he said, a Soviet reduction of conventional arms couldtake place that would allow negotiations on the short-range missilesfor eventual removal of all nuclear weapons from Europe.   ``Before we lock ourselves in on this issue at the NATOconference, we and the Americans need to clear up our positions,''Kohl said.   West Germany is to hold national elections late next year andKohl clearly does not want to jeopardize the governing ChristianDemocrats' chances of remaining in power by taking an unpopularstance on the missile issue.   In a statement issued after his talks with Baker, Kohl said hereaffirmed Bonn's willingness to define general defense policies atthe next NATO summit, but he did not make clear whether that wouldinclude support for modernization.   Baker's 15-nation tour of alliance countries produced some signsof reluctance among other member states. The Danish foreign ministertold reporters in Copenhagen that he expressed support for the WestGerman position during his talks with Baker.   Baker was to visit Turkey, Greece and Italy today.</TEXT></DOC>
