She was found guilty of 33 of the 41 federal counts on which shewas tried. The counts on which she was convicted related to evading$1.2 million in taxes from 1983 to 1985.   Mrs. Helmsley, who with her husband runs a multibillion-dollarreal estate empire, showed little emotion while the jury foremanread off the verdict, but occasionally shook her head.   Her co-defendants, former aides Frank Turco and Joseph Licari,were convicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme. Turco, whohad been charged in the extortion conspiracy, was also acquitted onthat charge.   All three also were acquitted on mail fraud charges.   Each of the 33 counts Mrs. Helmsley was convicted on carries amaximum prison term of three or five years. She could also facefines as high as $8 million. The extortion conspiracy charge carrieda 20-year maximum sentence.   Mrs. Helmsley was allowed to remain free on bail pendingsentencing Nov. 14. The judge and lawyers went into conference afterthe verdict was announced. As she waited, Mrs. Helmsley slumped inher chair, occasionally talking with her bodyguard, grandson andniece.   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, was depicted at the trial as arrogant,penny-pinching and mean-spirited. Her former housekeeper testifiedthat Mrs. Helmsley once told her, ``We don't pay taxes. Only thelittle people pay taxes.''   Her 80-year-old husband, Harry, was charged in the April 1988indictment but was not tried because the judge found him mentallyincompetent.   The verdict came in the fifth day of deliberations in U.S.District Court.   The bulk of the expenses on which the tax charges were based were$3.1 million in renovations and operating costs at the lavishGreenwich, Conn., mansion, Dunnellen Hall, which the Helmsleyspurchased for $11 million in June 1983.   Many of the bills were altered to make it appear the work wasdone at corporate entities. Prosecutors contended that the phonybills resulted in unreported income on the Helmsleys personal taxreturns and incorrect business deductions on the corporate returns.   The expenses included more than $1 million for a pool enclosurewith a marble dance floor on the roof, jade figures worth $500,000,a $130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system similar to one Mrs. Helmsleyhad admired in Disney World and thousands of dollars in landscapingwork.   The prosecution also alleged that $320,172 in Mrs. Helmsley'spersonal purchases were charged to the Park Lane Hotel, one ofseveral luxury Helmsley hotels in Manhattan.   These items ranged from tens of thousands of dollars in designerclothing to an $8 purchase of underwear. Another item was a $45,000silver clock specially designed in the shape of the HelmsleyBuilding, a birthday present to Helmsley from his wife.   During the trial, the hotel's former comptroller quoted Turco assaying the accounting system at the Park Lane was the ``Helmsleycheat-the-government system.''   The extortion conspiracy charge alleged that three liquor salesrepresentatives were forced to kick back a percentage of their salesto keep accounts at Helmsley hotels.   A former Helmsley executive, Milton Meckler, testified that Turcoonce held up several envelopes and said, ``This is cash. This iswhat Mrs. Helmsley wants.''   The extortion charge also covered three televisions for DunnellenHall that were allegedly extorted from the RCA Corp. while it wasseeking a lucrative contract with her Cleveland-based Harley Hotelchain.   Meckler testified that Mrs. Helmsley joked with him, ``How manymore can I get?''   Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses helped paint the harshpersonal portrait of Mrs. Helmsley that emerged during theeight-week trial.   They described how she fired employees at the slightestprovocation, disputed bills and always sought the lowest price.   Defense attorney Gerald Feffer attempted to discredit thewitnesses as disgruntled ex-employees who had a vendetta againstMrs. Helmsley, whom he described as tough and abrasive.   Feffer had argued that the Helmsleys did nothing wrong in billingtheir companies for part of the expenses at Dunnellen Hall becausethey used the estate for business.   He tried to explain away the phony bills by saying her employeesdevised the scheme to avoid contact with Mrs. Helmsley, who manytimes refused to pay contractors if she was not fully satisfied withtheir work.   Feffer had repeatedly pointed out that the Helmsleys paid $57.8million in taxes during the time period of the indictment.   The defense presented testimony from four witnesses, includingtwo tax experts who said the Helmsleys actually overpaid $591,000 infederal taxes in 1983-85 by underreporting the depreciation ofbuildings in Helmsley-controlled partnerships.</TEXT></DOC>
