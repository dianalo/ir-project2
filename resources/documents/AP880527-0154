Roh, presiding over a meeting of the National Security Council,said the dissident protests threaten the safety of the OlympicGames, which begin Sept. 17 in Seoul.   As part of tightened security preceding the Games, a Cabinetminister ordered police to maintain surveillance on foreignersspending long periods of time in South Korea without a definitepurpose.   In downtown Seoul, angry passers-by shouted ``Shame!'' as someof an estimated 7,000 riot police fired tear gas and repeatedlycharged about 3,000 radical students.   Police chased protesters into subways and tossed tear gasgrenades at passers-by who protested. Several officers lifted aprotesting businessman in a blue suit above their heads and carriedhim away.   Police broke up an attempted sit-in at City Hall and an attemptby about 500 students to march toward the U.S. Information Servicelibrary. They arrested dozens of students, beating and kicking manyof the protesters and hitting them with clubs as they were draggedaway.   There were no reports of injuries, and police did not give anoverall arrest figure.   Some students hurled firebombs and rocks at police, but mostjust chanted anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!''and ``Drive out the Yankees!'' they yelled.   Radical students claim the United States supports military rulein South Korea and enforces partition of the Korean peninsula,divided since 1945. The protesters demand the expulsion of the42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.   Protesters have attacked U.S. diplomatic buildings during theprotests, including the U.S. Embassy. No Americans have been hurt.   Protesters have also demanded that South Korea and North Koreaserve as co-hosts of the Olympics as a move toward reunification ofthe two countries.   Roh called the radicals a threat to the safety of the Games andsaid, ``It is imperative that all possible measures be taken toforestall acts of violence by domestic radical groups.''   Roh also warned that North Korea ``may stage any kind ofadventure and provocation to mar the success of the Games.''   Home Minister Lee Choon-koo, who is in charge of the nation's135,000 police, ordered the watch on certain foreigners to preventinfiltration by terrorists at the Olympics.   The government inaugurated a 13,000-member police Security TaskForce to guard Olympic athletes and facilities. Members wereselected for martial arts and foreign language skills.   Police also distributed 5,000 leaflets nationwide with portraitsof seven people suspected in the hijacking in 1970 of a Japanesejetliner to North Korea by the terrorist Red Army group.   One person suspected in the hijacking, Yasuhiro Shibata, 34, wasarrested in Tokyo after returning from North Korea on a falsepassport, police said.   In Tokyo, a police spokesman said officers were questioningShibata to try to determine if the Red Army planned any renewedterrorist action.   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 5,000 people marchedpeacefully to mark the anniversary of the end of a 1980anti-government uprising in which at least 191 people died.   A memorial service was held in Kwangju, about 165 miles south ofSeoul. Afterward, marchers, with a coffin bearing pictures of thedead, walked through the city.   Radicals claim Roh, an army general at the time, helped directthe police action.</TEXT></DOC>
