Separately, No. 11-ranked Wells Fargo andamp; Co. reported itsearnings rose 17 percent during the quarter, and No. 15 Bank of NewEngland Corp. said its earnings dropped 41 percent in the period.   New York-based Citicorp earned $358 million, or 99 cents pershare, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with earningsof $394 million, or $1.13 a share, last year. Combined interestincome and non-interest income gained 11 percent to $3.5 billion.   Manufacturers Hanover posted a loss of $789 million, or $15.46per share, compared with a profit of $198 million, or $3.77 pershare, in third quarter 1988. Combined interest and non-interestrevenue declined to $796 million from $949 million in the yearearlier quarter.   Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, earned $153.7 million, or$2.83 a share, in the third quarter, up from $131.7 million, or$2.36 per share, in 1988.   Bank of New England earned $42.7 million, or 61 cents a share,compared with a profit of $72.3 million, or $1.04 a share, in lastyear's third quarter.   Citicorp said it had strong results from many areas, includingthe global consumer business and domestic credit-card operation.   But it said continued uncertainty about Third World debt helpeddrag down earnings. It noted that Argentina made no loan paymentsthis year, vs. $26 million reported in the first three quarters oflast year, while Brazil made no payments in the third quarter afterpaying $154 million the previous two quarters.   Citicorp said its reserve to cover possible losses on ThirdWorld debt was $2.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, or 30percent of its $8.9 billion in total medium- and long-term loans toless developed countries.   For the first nine months of 1989, Citicorp earned $1.3 billion,or $3.62 cents a share, up 15 percent from $1.1 billion, or $3.17 ashare, in net income for the 1988 period.   The results include, among other things, a $77 million after-taxgain from the sale of property in Japan this year and a $55 millionafter-tax gain from the sale of the U.S. pension fund managementbusiness last year.   Manufacturers Hanover's net loss stemmed from the addition of$950 million to its reserve against possible losses on loans todeveloping countries, announced earlier this year. Without thereserve addition and tax benefits, the company would have had netincome of $91 million.   The company said the addition boosted its reserve for ThirdWorld loans rose to $2.4 billion, or 36 percent of its totaloutstanding medium- and long-term loans to developing countries.   Manufacturers Hanover said its operating earnings benefited froman improved net interest margin, better domestic credit quality andexpense control. Results for the third quarter included $213million in one-time revenue from the sale of assets, down from $578million in the year-earlier quarter.   For the first nine months of 1989, Manufacturers Hanover said itlost $580 million, or $11.82 per share, compared with profit of$742 million, or $14.28 per share, a year earlier.   Wells Fargo said its earnings rose in the third quarter largelyfrom higher net interest income, specifically from an increase indomestic loans. Net interest income rose to $544 million from $508million a year ago.   Non-interest income was $191.9 million, compared with $193.3million, while non-interest expense was $393.4 million, up form$392.7 million.   At the end of the third quarter Wells Fargo said it had nomedium- or long-term loans to less developed countries. Itsprovision for overall loan losses rose to $82 million from $75million.   During the nine-month period, Wells Fargo's earnings totaled$442.6 million, or $8.07 a share, vs. $376.6 million, or $6.75 ashare, in 1988.
