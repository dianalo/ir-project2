The Democrats Waffle --- Party Presents Dovish Image; Actions Taken by Reagan Give GOP Edge on Issue --- Simon Sees 'an Unfair Rap' </HL><AUTHOR> David Shribman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG EXE </G><DATELINE> IOWA CITY, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The white barns, grain elevators and cornfields along the highway make for a peaceful rural scene, but inside the van Gov. Michael Dukakis is struggling with questions of war.    The Massachusetts Democrat, campaigning for president in the state that next month holds the first caucuses of 1988, says he has no hard and fast guidelines for when American military force should be applied. Mr. Dukakis, who prefers the use of multinational forces, considers military action a &quot;last resort,&quot; an element to be introduced &quot;after exhausting diplomacy and international institutions and the other things that can make the use of force unnecessary.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis's anguish over the role of American military might isn't unusual among the seven Democratic presidential contenders. As they gather in Des Moines tonight for a televised debate, they still must come to grips with their party's politically dangerous ambivalence about the subject.    &quot;It's stunning how dovish the Democrats are emerging in this campaign, and it's making them very vulnerable for the general election,&quot; says Thomas Mann, a political scientist with the Brookings Institution. &quot;To win the Democratic nomination and to show well in Iowa, these candidates feel they have to move away from the tough talk.&quot;    Democratic candidates are plagued by confusion over the lessons of Vietnam, reluctant to take on new military obligations, troubled by the buildup in American military power in the Reagan years and besieged here in Iowa by interest groups assailing even the current level of U.S. engagements. As a result, the candidates are avoiding what some of their strategists believe is their most critical unresolved difference.    &quot;The perception you get from many of these candidates is that they haven't thought deeply about these issues -- and that when they have, they've come up with the most Pollyannish view possible,&quot; says Will Marshall, the policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats. &quot;They just don't seem to be comfortable talking about it.&quot;    By comparison, most voters have confidence that a Republican president would know how and when to use force. President Reagan's use of military action in Grenada and Libya was broadly popular with the American people, and the Republican candidates have endorsed such actions. The Democrats, meanwhile, can't agree on whether the Reagan administration has been justified in its use of force. Four years after U.S. forces invaded Grenada, the Democratic candidates still are sparring over the wisdom of the action.    The Democrats' squeamishness was on full display last autumn when party chairman Paul Kirk asked the candidates to give a specific example of when they would use American force. Not one of them gave an example.    Instead, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee spoke about &quot;the uniquely American principles and values of individual freedom and liberty.&quot; Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona talked about &quot;positive values, democracy, education, arms control.&quot; Gov. Dukakis spoke of &quot;respect for international law.&quot; And Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois spoke about &quot;caring for people, not viewing them as pawns in an East-West struggle.&quot;    Such campaign rhetoric reinforces the public perception that prompts voters to say -- by a 2-to-1 margin in a poll by the Democratic firm of Marttila andamp; Kiley -- that Republicans would do a better job than Democrats in guarding against Soviet aggression and dealing with terrorism. Moreover, a poll commissioned by the American Medical Association finds that no issue other than national defense puts the Democrats at so big a disadvantage among voters.    Some analysts believe that the Democratic candidates confuse public impatience over high Pentagon spending with a desire to lower the U.S. national-security posture. &quot;Democrats are making a mistake if they think that just because people want to cut defense spending, they also aren't willing to use force in the world,&quot; says Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster. &quot;The Democrats are communicating that they don't think we need a strong defense.&quot;    Such a perception would be an enormous disadvantage to Democrats in the South, the region that for decades provided the party with a solid voting bloc. A Democratic Leadership Council poll identified swing voters in Southern states and found that they were &quot;quite willing, under selective circumstances, to commit American forces abroad.&quot; Nearly three-quarters of them, in fact, favored strong retaliatory measures, including military action, against countries supporting terrorism.    &quot;Southerners haven't viewed Democratic candidates as commander-in-chief material,&quot; laments Kirk O'Donnell, the president of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank. Democratic pollster Thomas Kiley, who now is advising Mr. Dukakis, adds: &quot;We have a lot of explaining to do to the American people.&quot;    In the past year, as the candidates struggled to lay the groundwork for the political contests now less than a month away, only former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado has set out some principles to guide the use of U.S. military force. In an address delivered before he withdrew from the race last spring -- only to re-enter this winter -- Mr. Hart set out seven criteria for the engagement of U.S. force. These included clear definitions of U.S. objectives, an agreement on the command structure of the engagement, and a requirement that the operation &quot;pass the test of simplicity&quot; and &quot;be achievable in its operation.&quot; He also stipulated that the military engagement must have public support.    Only Sen. Gore, who has aimed his campaign at the Southern primaries scheduled for March 8, has sought to capitalize on the force issue. &quot;We should always prefer diplomacy, but we must understand there are times when we must use force,&quot; says Mr. Gore, who over the course of the campaign has hardened his position substantially. &quot;I sense a real discomfort among all {the other candidates} when this sort of thing comes up.&quot;    In Rep. Richard Gephardt's major address on defense policy, he raised what he called &quot;the ultimate question of strategy.&quot; But he then skirted the issue, saying he has no &quot;litmus test&quot; for the use of force and assuring his listeners at American University in Washington that &quot;if as a last resort it becomes necessary to use force, it will only be to advance clearly stated goals that are clearly in the national interest -- goals that are consistent with our values and the rule of law.&quot; He has refused to say anything further on the subject.    Mr. Babbitt, acknowledging that the subject causes him anguish, says only that U.S. force should be committed after an assessment of &quot;the chances of quick and decisive results.&quot;    The Rev. Jesse Jackson repeatedly skirts the question. In a nationally televised NBC debate last month, Mr. Jackson would say only that there would be &quot;tremendous consequences&quot; -- he wouldn't specify them -- if the Soviets established a base in Nicaragua. When asked during a Democratic Leadership Council debate in Miami how he would respond if the Sandinistas broke a peace agreement, he equivocated and answered, in part, &quot;Let's give peace a chance.&quot;    Gov. Dukakis says he wouldn't rule out the possibility of military strikes against terrorists' bases and camps. He also says he wouldn't rule it out if Soviet offensive weapons were introduced into Nicaragua or if the Warsaw Pact nations invaded Western Europe. He acknowledges that the public holds the Democrats in low esteem on this question but adds, &quot;The American people also are concerned about trigger-happy presidents and the Reagan administration's willingness in the early years to use force as a first resort.&quot;    Sen. Simon, often portrayed as the most liberal and most dovish of the Democratic candidates, argues that Democrats have acquired &quot;an unfair rap&quot; on the force issue. &quot;You ought to use the tools of diplomacy first, and on those occasions when American lives or vital American interests may be at stake, you apply force,&quot; he says.    All seven Democrats use variations on that theme, prompting hard-liner Richard Perle, who until recently was the Reagan administration's assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, to say: &quot;They love the rubbish about using diplomacy first, but you don't ever get to the question about force until you have tried diplomacy. They've got to do better than that cliche.&quot;    Critics of the Democrats' position also disagree with their emphasis on multilateral military efforts in concert with allies. These critics say that allied agreement is often elusive and that, in many cases, joint military ventures are awkward and unrealistic. The phrase &quot;consulting with allies,&quot; according to Mr. Mann, the Brookings political scientist, &quot;is a code word for unwillingness to assert American power.&quot;    The Democrats' hesitation about the use of force grows out of the Vietnam era, when the party was rent by the war and when Republicans seemed to replace Democrats as the party of internationalism. At the same time, Democratic Party rule changes, designed to take power away from local bosses, gave more power to grass-roots organizations that grew in large measure out of the peace movement.    Few states provide as vivid an example of this process as Iowa, where peace activists -- some got their political baptism in the Vietnam protests, others in the nuclear-freeze movement -- will be major players in next month's caucuses.    &quot;The most active groups in the nominating process are dovish,&quot; says William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;They're exacting a price for their support, but it creates a problem for the candidates and for the party. This is one of the reasons Democratic support from white males has fallen to alarmingly low levels.&quot;    Says Larry Smith, a former Hart aide who is the president of the bipartisan Business Executives for National Security: &quot;Most of the bright people in the Democratic Party either got so burned from Vietnam that they never got back into questions like this or have run away from them.&quot;    The result is a party that, in the eyes of many voters, lacks the resolve not only to send American soldiers into combat but also to debate what interests the U.S. ought to define as critical.    &quot;These candidates haven't told us much about what they would defend,&quot; says Jeffrey Record, a senior research fellow at the Hudson Institute and former defense aide to Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia. &quot;For all we know, we're wasting a lot of money on the instruments of force if these people aren't willing to use them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
