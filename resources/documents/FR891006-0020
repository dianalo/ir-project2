The revised regulation implementsamendments to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) contained in theFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). TheFIRREA amendments expand the coverage of HMDA to include mortgage lendersthat are not affiliated with depository institutions or holding companies,and require covered institutions to report data regarding mortgage andhome improvement loan applications they receive in addition to data regardingloan originations and purchases. Most institutions will now also be requiredto report the race, sex and income of mortgage and home improvement loanapplicants and borrowersThe Board is proposing to adopt a ``loan/application register'' form forHMDA reporting, on which institutions would record the required informationfor applications completed, loans actually made, and loans purchased. Inparticular, the Board is seeking public comment on the layout and categoriesof the loan/application register and on the summary tables that would beproduced by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)from the data submitted.The FIRREA amendments are effective on January 1, 1990, and the first setof reports in the new register format will be due in early 1991.

The regulation currently requires depository institutions,mortgage banking subsidiaries of holding companies, and savings and loanservice corporations that have over $10 million in assets and have officesin metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) or primary metropolitan statisticalareas (PMSAs), to disclose annually their originations and purchases ofmortgage and home improvement loans. Data must be itemized by census tract(or by county, in some instances) and also by type of loan. A disclosurestatement covering the data on a calendar-year basis currently must bemade available to the public and sent to the institution's federal supervisoryagency by March 31 following the calendar year for which the data are compiled.The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA),which was signed into law on August 9, 1989, made a number of significantamendments to HMDA. (FIRREA, Pub. L. No. 101-73, section 1211, 103 Stat.183, 524-526 (1989).) First, the coverage of HMDA was expanded to includemortgage lenders that are not affiliated with depository institutions orholding companies. Second, the FIRREA amendments require that institutionsreport data regarding loan applications; currently, only data regardingloans originated or purchased are reported. Third, the FIRREA amendmentsrequire most covered lenders to report the race, sex, and income of mortgageapplicants and borrowers; depository institutions with assets under $30million are exempt from this particular requirement. Fourth, the FIRREAamendments require that lenders identify the class of purchaser for loansthat they sell. Finally, the amendments permit lenders to explain the basisfor their lending decisions to their supervisory agency.The FIRREA amendments apply beginning with calendar year 1990, and dataconsistent with the new requirements will be due on the reports filed byinstitutions in early 1991. The FIRREA amendments do not affect the requirementsfor reports of calendar year 1989 data. The current provisions of RegulationC govern these reports, which are due by March 31, 1990; for these reports,institutions should use Form HMDA-1 or HMDA-2 as appropriate. (The currentedition of <T3>A Guide to HMDA Reporting, </T3>published by the FFIEC in January 1989,provides guidance on complying with the current Regulation C and can beused in reporting on the 1989 data. The guide will be rewritten to reflectthe FIRREA amendments.)To implement the FIRREA amendments, the Board is publishing proposed revisionsto Regulation C. The proposed revisions provide for a ``register'' formof reporting. Under the proposed arrangement, lenders would record dataon a loan-by-loan and application-by-application basis and submit theirregisters to their supervisory agency. The Board believes that institutionswould have to maintain detailed information, given the FIRREA requirements,under any reporting arrangement that the Board might adopt. Under the Board'sproposal, however, institutions would not have to undertake the additionalstep and cost of cross-tabulating the data. The register should thereforekeep the new reporting burden to a minimum.The Board is publishing a revised regulation in its entirety in order tofacilitate review by commenters. However, the major changes, aside fromthe expansion in coverage of lenders, affect the data to be collected andthe form in which the data will be reported (see andSection; 203.4 of theproposed regulation).The format for data submission is being developed in consultation withthe agencies responsible for enforcing HMDA, namely the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC), the Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Office of theComptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision(OTS). Several of these agencies currently require use of a register. Itis contemplated that adoption of the register approach under HMDA couldlead to elimination of duplicative register requirements, although an agencymight collect data, in addition to that required by HMDA, as an addendumto the HMDA register.The comment period ends on November 3, 1989. Because prompt implementationof the statutory amendments is in the public interest, the Board has setthis comment period in place of the 60 days normally called for in theBoard's policy statement on rulemaking (44 FR 3957, January 19, 1979).The Board believes an abbreviated comment period is necessary to ensurethat a final rule is in place as quickly as possible to provide guidanceto covered lenders.The information that must be collected is mandated by the Congress. However,the Board does invite comment on the layout of the register and on whetheradditional or different categories and codes should be used to collectthe required information. It also invites comment on the summary tables(discussed under ``Aggregated data'' below) that would be produced by theFFIEC from data submitted by covered institutions.In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, and 5 CFR 1320.13, the proposed revisions to the reportingform will be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to theBoard by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration of thecomments received during the public comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Section-by-Section Summary</ITAG>The proposed changes to each section of the regulation are discussed below.Section 203.1_Authority, Purpose, and ScopeA new paragraph in andSection; 203.1(b) reflects the purpose of the expandedreporting requirements, stated in the FIRREA amendments, of identifyingpossible discriminatory lending patterns. Section 203.1 (c) and (d) havebeen revised to clarify the coverage and scope of the regulation and toset forth the role of the FFIEC in producing reports from data submittedby institutions.Section 203.2_DefinitionsSection 203.2 contains definitions of terms used in the regulation, andhas been revised as follows.<T3>Act</T3>. The definition of ``act'' in andSection; 203.2(a) is unchanged.<T3>Application.</T3> Under section 1211(c) of the FIRREA amendments, institutionsare required to report data for completed loan applications, in additionto data for loans originated or purchased. A definition of ``application''has been added as proposed andSection;203.2(b); succeeding provisions havebeen renumbered accordingly.For purposes of coverage, an application results when an institution hascollected the information normally obtained in evaluating borrowers forthe type of credit requested. This treatment of ``application'' in theproposed regulation and of ``completed application'' in the Board's RegulationB (Equal Credit Opportunity) (12 CFR 202.2(f)) are similar. They differin that the Regulation B definition requires that the institution havereceived all the information for evaluating applications for the amountand type of credit requested, including such items as credit reports andinsurance approvals, while to meet the requirement for Regulation C, theapplication is to be treated as complete even if institution has not receivedreports or approvals by secondary market entities, government entities,or private mortgage insurers. (The treatment under Regulation C is in keepingwith congressional intent as reflected in the legislative history.) A completedapplication would also exist for purposes of Regulation C in instanceswhere, though the application is technically incomplete, the lender hasa sufficient basis on which to approve or deny the request for credit.In addition, under Regulation B, an institution may in certain instancessend the applicant a notice of incompleteness, and if the applicant failsto respond within a reasonable period stated in the notice, the institutionhas no further obligation to act on the crdit request. (Refer to RegulationB, andSection;202.9(c)(2).) The Board solicits comment on whether this situationshould be deemed a withdrawn application for purposes of HMDA reporting(and identified as such on the register) or whether a separate category(such as ``file closed for incompleteness'') should be used.<T3>Branch office.</T3> The branch office definition has several implications.First, institutions that do not have a home or branch office in an MSAare completely exempt from HMDA. Second, institutions must identify thecensus tract for loans on property located in any MSA in which the institutionhas a home or branch office. Third, loan data must be made available tothe public at one branch office (or the home office) in each MSA wherethe institution has a home or branch office. Finally, the institution mustpost notices in all branch offices located in MSAs to inform the publicof the availability of the HMDA data.Section 203.2(c)(1) of the proposed regulation retains, for depositoryinstitutions, the branch office definition currently set forth in andSection;203.2(b)(1)(i)without substantive change. A branch office for banks, savings and loanassociations, and credit unions is an office approved as a branch by aFederal or state supervisory agency.Just last year, the Congress expanded HMDA coverage to institutions otherthan depository institutions, namely to mortgage banking subsidiaries ofbank and thrift holding companies and to savings and loan service corporations.As discussed in more detail below, the FIRREA amendments further expandthe coverage of HMDA to ``other lending institutions.'' For all of theseentities, designated as ``mortgage lending institutions'' in the proposedregulation, the Board proposes to retain the definition of branch officecurrently in andSection;203.2(b)(1)(ii), moving it to proposed andSection;203.2(c)(2).A branch office is any physical office of the institution that receivesapplications from the public for home purchase or home improvement loans.In addition, under section 1211(f) of the FIRREA amendments, ``other lendinginstitutions''_which is to say any covered institution other than a bank,savings association, or credit union_are deemed to have a branch officein any MSA in which they receive applications for, originate, or purchasefive or more home purchase or home improvement loans. Proposed andSection;203.2(c)(2)incorporates this rule. The five-or-more-loan rule will apply for purposesof determining coverage and of geographic itemization, but it is contemplatedthat lending institutions will be required to make disclosure statementsavailable and to post HMDA notices only in those MSAs where they have aphysical presence.<T3>Dwelling. </T3>In the current regulation, parenthetical material inthe definitions of home purchase and home improvement loans indicates whatis included in the term ``dwelling.'' Proposed andSection;203.2(d) adds adefinition of ``dwelling'' that consolidates this material as well as thedefinition of ``state.''<T3>FHA, FmHA, and VA loans. </T3>The definition of these loans, currentlycontained in andSection;203.2(c), has been deleted from andSection;203.2 ofthe regulation and placed in the instructions for completing the reportingform (appendix A to the regulation).<T3>Financial institution. </T3>Current andSection;203.2(e) defines the institutionssubject to Regulation C as ``financial institution[s],'' which includedepository institutions (banks, savings and loan associations, and creditunions and their majority-owned subsidiaries), mortgage banking subsidiariesof bank and savings and loan holding companies, and savings and loan servicecorporations.In the proposed revision to andSection;203.2(e), the term ``financial institution''is defined to refer to all institutions covered by the regulation. Includedin the definition are banks, savings and loan associations, and creditunions as well as ``mortgage lending institutions'' (as discussed below,subsidiaries of depository institutions would fall in the latter category).Under the current regulation, depository institutions such as banks andsavings associations are covered provided they originate ``federally relatedmortgages loans,'' defined in current andSection; 203.2(d). The term ``federallyrelated mortgage loan'' is relevant only for determining whether a depositoryinstitution is covered by HMDA. Proposed andSection; 203.2(e)(1) combines,in substance, the definition of ``financial institution'' currently containedin andSection; 203.2(e)(1)(i) and the current definition of ``federally relatedmortgage loan.'' The Board has found that having separate definitions causesconfusion regarding coverage. Accordingly, banks, savings associations,and credit unions are defined as financial institutions under andSection;203.2(e)(1) if they write home-purchase loans and are federally insuredor regulated, or if they write home-purchase loans that are federally insuredor supplemented or will be sold to FNMA, GNMA, or FHLMC. The Board seekscomment on whether this definition could be simplified by providing merelythat federally insured institutions making home-purchase loans are covered.In section 1211(d) of the FIRREA amendments, the Congress expanded thecoverage of HMDA to include ``other lending institutions.'' An ``otherlending institution'' is defined in section 1211(e)(2) of the act as ``anyperson engaged for profit in the business of mortgage lending.'' The proposedregulation refers to these entities as ``mortgage lending institutions''in andSection; 203.2(e)(2); the term also covers mortgage banking subsidiariesof bank and savings and loan holding companies and savings and loan servicecorporations (and, as discussed below, mortgage banking subsidiaries ofdepository institutions).An entity is a ``mortgage lending institution'' under proposed andSection;203.2(e)(2) if, in the preceding calendar year, 10 percent or more of itsloan volume consisted of home purchase loans. This threshold mirrors therule currently used in andSection; 203.2(e)(1)(ii) to define whether a holdingcompany subsidiary is a ``mortgage banking'' subsidiary.Under current andSection; 203.2(e)(2), majority-owned subsidiaries of banksand savings associations are treated as part of their parent institution.Accordingly, data submitted by the parent institution currently includethat of the subsidiary and are itemized by census tract only if the loansrelate to property in an MSA where the parent has a home or branch office.In light of the definition of ``other lending institution'' contained inthe FIRREA amendments, the Board believes this treatment is no longer appropriate.Given the statute's five-or-more-loan rule for branch offices, discussedabove, to continue the current reporting arrangement for subsidiaries ofdepository institutions would magnify the difference in treatment accordedto subsidiaries based on corporate structure. A holding company subsidiarywould be required to provide census tract information for loans in MSAswhere it took applications for, originated, or purchased five or more mortgageloans, while the data of bank subsidiaries, for example, would containthis information only for MSAs in which the parent institution has a physicalbranch location. The Board believes that a difference in corporate structuredoes not justify such markedly different results.Consequently, the Board proposes to treat mortgage lending subsidiariesof depository institutions as independent corporate entities under thedefinition of ``other lending institution.'' As such, they will complywith HMDA in their own right as mortgage lending institutions if they meetthe 10 percent threshold, under proposed andSection; 2032.(e)(2).<T3>Home improvement and home purchase loans. </T3>Institutions are requiredto report data regarding home improvement and home purchase loans. Thedefinitions of these terms are incorporated in proposed andSection; 203.2(f)and andSection; 203.2(g). With the added definition of ``dwelling'' in proposedandSection; 203.2(d), the parenthetical references to condominiums, cooperatives,and mobile and manufactured homes have been deleted.<T3>Metropolitan statistical area. </T3>Institutions are required to specifythe location of the property to which a loan relates if the property islocated in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the institutionhas a home or a branch office. The definition of MSA in proposed andSection;203.2(j) is unchanged.<T3>State. </T3>The definition of ``state,'' currently contained in andSection;203.2(i), has been eliminated as unnecessary in light of its inclusionin the proposed definition of ``dwelling.''Section 203.3_Exempt InstitutionsSection 203.3 excludes from the coverage of the regulation small institutions,institutions that do not have offices in MSAs, and institutions that havebeen granted an exemption because they are subject to a similar state law.A new andSection; 203.3(c)(2) has been added to provide that institutionswhich become subject to HMDA during the course of a given year_for example,by exceeding the 10 percent threshold for coverage as a ``mortgage lendinginstitution''_shall report data beginning with the following calendar year.Current andSection; 203.2(c)(2) has been redesignated andSection; 203.3(c)(3).Section 203.4_Compilation of Loan DataSection 203.4 sets forth the requirements for reporting of loan data andhas been revised extensively. The FIRREA amendments require institutionsto report data on all loan applications, not merely on originations andpurchases of loans as is currently the case. The FIRREA amendments alsorequire reporting of data of the race, sex, and income of applicants andborrowers, in addition to the geographic information that is currentlyrequired. In view of this increase in the data to be reported, the Boardbelieves the cross-tabulated reporting format currently in use is impractical.The Board is proposing, instead, a register form of reporting.Currently, institutions report data in a summary format, cross-tabulatedby census tract and type of loan, and reflect the number and dollar amountof loans in five loan categories. For loans in MSAs where the institutionhas a home or a branch office, these data are subtotalled separately foreach census tract in which loans are originated or purchased. If this summaryformat were to be rented, multiple reporting forms would be needed to captureall the data called for by the FIRREA amendments. Institutions would useone form to report loan originations, applications denied, and applicationswithdrawn within each census tract for the five loan categories. Anotherform would be required for data on loan purchases. Still another wouldidentify the type of purchaser of loans that are sold. Finally, three setsof multiple forms_one page for each of the five loan categories_would berequired for cross-tabulating the data on race, sex, and income with typeof loan.In reviewing the options, the Board has determined that continuing thecross-tabulated form of reporting currently in use would be extremely confusingand burdensome for reporting institutions. In the Conference Report tothe FIRREA amendments, the Congress gave the Board flexibility to establisha reporting format that will maximize the utility of the data while minimizing,to the extent possible, the reporting burden for covered institutions.(H.R. Rep. No. 101-222, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 459). Accordingly, the Boardis proposing in andSection; 203.4 that institutions report by means of aloan/application register, using a form like that set forth in appendixA of the proposed regulation. Under this arrangement, institutions wouldrecord data on a loan-by-loan and application-by-application basis andwould submit the completed register to their supervisory agency. The FFIECwould produce individual reports for each institution and aggregate tablesfor each MSA using the data from the registers (see the discussions belowunder ``Aggregated data'').The Board believes that the register approach presents a number of advantages.Institutions would collect the detailed information called for by the FIRREAamendments, but would not have to undertake the additional step of preparingcross-tabulated HMDA reports. The Board believes that a register is thereforeeasier and less costly for institutions to complete. In addition, manyinstitutions are already familiar with the register format since they havecomplied with similar requirements of the OTS, the OCC, and the FDIC. Theseagencies are undertaking to review their current requirements to determinethe extent to which the register called for by Regulation C could serveas a substitute for the ones they now require. And while the supervisoryagencies would incur significant added costs in entering the increasedamount of data that would be submitted, the burden on covered institutionswould be eased. The reporting of raw data also would permit the FFIEC toproduce reports based on a variety of different breakdowns of the data.The specific requirements for the register and the summary tables thatthe FFIEC would produce are discussed below in the sections on appendixA and ``Aggregated data.''Proposed andSection; 203.4(a) contains, among other things, a requirementthat institutions collect data on the race and sex of applicants, and proposedandSection; 203.4(b)(1) tells how race and sex information may be collected.Section 203.13 of the Board's Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity) requiresthat data about race or national origin and sex be collected on applicationsfor loans to finance the purchase of a principal residence; andSection; 202.5(d)of Regulation B generally prohibits lenders from requesting it in othercircumstances. One exception, under andSection; 202.5(b)(2), is that lendersare permitted to request the information if they are required to do soby a Federal regulation. With the addition of andSection; 203.4(b)(1) toRegulation C, lenders must collect this information for home improvementloans and home purchase loans on property not intended as the borrower'sprincipal residence_loans not covered by andSection; 202.13_without violatingRegulation B. A form and instructions for collecting data on race and sexis contained in appendix B of the proposed regulation.The FIRREA amendments require the reporting of data on race, sex, and incomefor applications and originations but not purchased loans. Despositoryinstitutions with assets of $30 million or less are not required to reportthis information. Proposed andSection; 203.4(b)(2) provides for optionalreporting of these data for loan purchases and by depository institutionswith assets of $30 million or less. Under the FIRREA amendments, mortgagelending institutions do not qualify for the $30 million exception and hencemust include data on race, sex, and income for all applications and loanoriginations, though not for purchased loans.A new andSection; 203.4(c) has been added to implement section 1211(b) ofthe FIRREA amendments, which permits institutions, at their option, toreport reasons for their loan decisions. Proposed andSection; 203.4(c) authorizesoptional reporting of such data. Current andSection; 203.4(c), relating toexcluded data, has been redesignated andSection; 203.4(d).Proposed andSection; 203.4(d) relates to data that is not to be reported.Two changes have been made to this provision. First, the Board proposesto eliminate the rule that mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank and savingsand loan holding companies are not to report FHA loans, currently containedin andSection; 203.4(c)(2). Data on FHA loans by these institutions was originallycollected by HUD outside of HMDA. Now that HUD is a direct participantin the implementation of HMDA, it appears appropriate to collect and disclosethese data on the HMDA reports. Dropping the current provision will alsoresult in a uniform rule for reporting of these loans by all institutionsand avoid confusion. Otherwise, data would be incomplete as to lendingby nondepository institutions, a result that is inconsistent with the congressionalintent reflected in the FIRREA amendments.The exclusion for refinancings between the original parties, currentlycontained in andSection; 203.4(c)(1)(iii), has been deleted. The Board proposesthat refinancings of home purchase loans be treated as home purchase orhome improvement loans, as applicable, even when they involve the originalborrower and original lender. The Board has found that the exclusion ofrefinancings between original parties has been a source of confusion. Whilerefinancings between original parties may not technically result in newmoney being disbursed into the community, the Board believes that thesetransactions do provide an indication of an institution's willingness tomeet credit need. Accordingly, the current exclusion has been deleted andrefinancings between the original parties, if they otherwise meet the definitionof home purchase or home improvement loans, would be reported in full underthe proposed regulation.Section 203.5_Disclosure and Reporting Section 203.5 sets the rules for making loan data available at officesof an institution and reporting the data to supervisory agencies. The Boardproposes to require that institutions submit registers for a given calendaryear to their supervisory agency by the following February 15. Currently,disclosure statements are due by March 31. An earlier reporting date isnecessary to ensure that disclosure statements can be prepared by the FFIECin a timely fashion. The Board also believes an earlier date is reasonablegiven that minimal processing on the part of institutions will be required.Also, the register format will not require institutions to cross-tabulateloan and application information for the entire calendear year in orderto prepare their HMDA submissions, as is presently the case. Section 203.5 of the proposed regulation also provides that institutionsmake available disclosure statements within 15 business days after receivingthem from the FFIEC. As discussed below, the FFIEC will be producing thedisclosure statements from the registers that are submitted and will providethose statements to the reporting institutions. The Board considered whetherthe registers themselves should be disclosed to the public. Currently,those agencies that require registers do not make the registers public,due to privacy and other concerns, and the Board proposes to follow thisapproach in Regulation C. Other provisions in andSection; 203.5, such as those concerning notices andtimes of availability, are unchanged. Section 203.6_Enforcement Section 203.6 sets forth rules relating to administrative enforcement andbona fide errors. The provisions of this section are essentially unchanged.Appendix A_Forms and Instructions Appendix A contains the loan/application register and instructions forits completion. Institutions must use the prescribed format but are notrequired to use the form itself. An institution may, for example, chooseto produce a computer printout of its register instead. Due to the volumeof data being submitted, the Board encourages covered institutions to developcomputer programs that will enable them to submit the data in machine-readableformat. The Board plans to publish standards to facilitate electronic submissionwhen it publishes the amended regulation in final form. The following is a summary of the information that would be provided onthe register and the number of characters to be allotted for each dataitem. The instructions contained in proposed Appendix A provide guidanceon the requirements for the register and answer more detailed questions.<T3>Application or loan number.</T3> A unique number identifying the applicationor transaction. For FHA loans, it must be the FHA case number; otherwiseany number the institution chooses to use. (25 characters) <T3>Date of application.</T3> For applications, the date the applicationwas submitted by year, month, and day. (6 characters) <T3>Application or loan information.</T3> Codes indicating the type ofloan, the purpose of the loan, and whether the property is owner-occupied,plus the amount of the loan (or the amount applied for) in thousands ofdollars. (1 character each for type, purpose, and occupancy status; 5 charactersfor amount) <T3>Action taken and date.</T3> A code indicating whether the entry relatesto an approved, rejected, or withdrawn application, or to a loan purchase.Also, the date the action occurred. (1 character for action taken; 4 charactersfor month and day) <T3>Location of the property.</T3> For loans written on property in MSAswhere the institution has a home or branch office, the location of theproperty. (4 characters for MSA, 2 for state, 3 for county, and 6 for censustract) <T3>Applicant characteristics.</T3> A code indicating the race and sexof the applicant and any coapplicant, and the income relied upon in thousandsof dollars. This section need not be completed (by any institution) forloan purchases; and it need not be completed by any bank, savings and loanor credit union with $30 million or less in assets. (1 character each forrace and sex of applicant and of coapplicant; 4 characters for income)<T3>Type of purchaser.</T3> For loans that are sold, a code indicatingthe class of purchaser. (1 character) <T3>Reason for denial.</T3> Up to two codes indicating the reasons fordenial. This information is optional. (2 characters) The Board is interested in receiving public comment on whether the numberof reasons for denial should be expanded to be more specific, perhaps alongthe lines of the reasons identified in the model forms for adverse actioncontained in Regulation B. Appendix B_Form and Instructions for Data Collection on Race and Sex Appendix B of the current regulation prescribes the supervisory agenciesto which institutions must submit their reports. This material has beenincorporated into the instructions to the reporting form, in appendix A.Independent mortgage lending institutions will submit their registers toHUD while subsidiaries of depository institutions or their holding companieswill submit their registers to the FDIC. Federal Reserve, or OTS. Proposed appendix B contains a form that can be used to collect data onrace and sex, and instructions for its use. It is identical to the formprescribed in Regulation B for data collection related to applicationsfor home purchase loans, except for the added reference to HMDA. (3) <T3>Aggregated data.</T3> The FFIEC (with support from each of the federalregulators with HMDA responsibilities) aggregates the loan data receivedfrom all reporting institutions in each MSA. The FFIEC also produces tablesfor each MSA showing lending patterns according to demographic characteristicssuch as income level and age of housing stock. These tables, together withdisclosure statements of the individual institutions, are sent to centraldata depositories in each MSA, where they are available to the public.Under the Board's proposal, the FFIEC would generate disclosure statementsfrom the register data submitted by institutions. These statements (inthe form of summary tables) would be provided to the institutions, whichwould in turn make them available to the public. The FFIEC expects thatthese statements would be provided to institutions by October followingsubmission of the register data on February 15. This timetable is dictatedby the large volume of data to be processed. The supervisory agencies andthe FFIEC will take appropriate steps, however, to ensure that both theindividual disclosure statements and the aggregate tables become availableto the public as early as possible. Reporting institutions will be encouraged,for example, to submit data in machine-readable form to facilitate earlieravailability. The FFIEC plans to produce summary tables annually for each institution,to show lending activity in each MSA for which the institution reportsdata. In addition, aggregate tables based on loan data from all coveredinstitutions would be prepared for each MSA and sent to central data depositories.The Board emphasizes that these tables would be prepared by the FFIEC fromregister data submitted, and not by individual institutions.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6210-01-M007 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 770-776 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6210-01-C </ITAG>Sample Tables 1 and 2 are similar to the current HMDA-1 Part A (Originations)and HMDA-1 Part B (Purchases) forms. Sample Table 1 would show the dispositionof loan applications (granted, denied, or withdrawn) by loan category withineach census tract. Sample Table 2 would show loans purchased by loan categorywithin each census tract. These two tables would be produced for each MSAin which the institution has offices. Under section 1211(b) of the FIRREA amendments, institutions are requiredto identify the class of purchaser of loans that are sold. Using thesedata from registers, the FIRREA plans to produce a report similar to thatset forth as Sample Table 3. This sample table would indicate, for allloans sold by the institution, the number and dollar amount sold by classof purchaser. The table would reflect activity by the institution in allMSAs, and the classes would cover all major categories of purchasers. The FIRREA also plans to produce four other tables to reflect the dataon race, sex, and income that must be reported under section 1211(a) ofthe FIRREA amendments_Sample Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7. The FIRREA would preparethese tables for each loan category. Sample Table 4 would show dispostionof applciations by the race, sex and income of applicants or borrowers.Disposition cateogories would include the total number and dollar amountof applications received, loans granted, applications denied, and applicationswithdrawn. Sample Table 5 would show the disposition of applications brokendown by the income and by the race of the applicant or borrower. SampleTable 6 would show disposition of applications by the income and sex ofthe applicant or borrower. Sample Table 7 would show the disposition ofapplications within groups of census tracts, categorized by their raceand income characteristics.(4) <T3>Effective dates. </T3>The FIRREA amendments apply to applications received,and loans originated or purchased, on or after January 1, 1990. Under theBoard's proposal, institutions will be required to report data for calendaryear 1990 in the revised format by February 15, 1991. The current requirementsof Regualtion C apply to reports of data for calendar year 1989; accordingly,institutions will use current forms HMDA-1 or HMDA-2, as appropriate, forthe reports that are due on March 31, 1990.
