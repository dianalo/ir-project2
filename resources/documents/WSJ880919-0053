White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><DATELINE> BANGKOK, Thailand  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A military group led by two men described as supporters of former ruler Ne Win took power in embattled Burma, and angry citizens armed with homemade weapons poured into Rangoon's streets to reject the new regime only hours after it was announced.    There were no reports of casualties or arrests. But diplomats expect the coupfollowing weeks of demonstrations by protestors demanding the removal of the military-backed Burma Socialist Program Party regime -- to trigger violent confrontations between the armed forces and the public.    State-run radio announced yesterday afternoon that security forces had assumed power in order to halt deteriorating conditions within the country, restore law and order, and pave the way for multiparty democratic elections, which had been promised by the ousted government of President Maung Maung. Radio broadcasts didn't say what happened to the president or other government officials.    Many observers had expected a military coup for weeks because the armed forces have been among the few Burmese institutions not completely disrupted by weeks of strikes and demonstrations. To quell the unrest, the observers said, the coup leaders would have to show clear signs of appeasement toward the protesters, who have been demanding the installation of an interim government in advance of democratic elections. But yesterday's announcements contained no indication that the military junta will take a conciliatory stance.    The new leadership said it will continue the previous regime's plans for a general election, but those plans already had been rejected by the opposition on the grounds that elections held under the auspices of the autocratic regime wouldn't be trusted. The existing state apparatus was abolished, but a dismantling of the Burma Socialist Program Party, which has been a longstanding opposition demand, wasn't ordered. The coup leaders also imposed a curfew between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m., banned demonstrations and ordered all government employees to return to work today.    The coup group, the newly formed State Committee for Establishment of Law and Order, is led by the armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Saw Maung, who since July had served as defense minister. It also includes Lt. Gen. Than Shwe, deputy defense minister. Both were described as staunch supporters of Ne Win, the despot who seized power in a 1962 military coup, centralized social and economic power in the hands of the state and oversaw the 26-year transformation of Burma from one of Southeast Asia's richest countries to one of the world's most impoverished nations. Ne Win officially resigned in July but has continued to dictate government policy because of continuing support within the Burma Socialist Program Party and the highly disciplined military, analysts say.    Shortly after yesterday's broadcast, thousands of demonstrators poured into Rangoon's streets, many calling for armed resistance to the coup, reports from the capital city said. In downtown Rangoon, people carried gasoline bombs, pitchforks, slingshots and swords, a Western observer in the capital said. Diplomats and other observers heard gunshots in various parts of Rangoon, including the city center.    Military forces were said to be converging on Rangoon General Hospital, a popular rallying point for protestors in recent weeks, and soldiers were believed to be surrounding a monastery that housed military personnel who had joined the antigovernment demonstrations. </TEXT></DOC>
