A Confederate flag fluttersin a warm breeze.   Young women in colorful hoop skirts square-dance with partnersdressed in the gray uniforms of the Confederacy.   Welcome to Americana, where descendants of Rebels who fled theUnited States after the Civil War hold an annual picnic to keepsome of their traditions alive - even though most of them don'tspeak English.   Memories of the Rebel past remain strong in this fertilesugar-cane region 85 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largestcity.   In a graveyard at nearby Santa Barbara D'Oeste, about 400Confederate settlers and some of their offspring are buried in theshade of pine, eucalyptus, mango and palm trees.   Among them is the great-uncle of Rosalynn Carter, wife of formerPresident Carter. His epitaph reads:   ``To the Memory of W.S. Wise. Born in Edgefield, South Carolina,Oct. 13, 1833. Died in Santa Barbara, Brazil, April 14, 1877.''   An inscription on another tombstone captures the defiance ofthose who came to Brazil:   ``Roberto Stell Steagall - Once a Rebel, Twice a Rebel andForever a Rebel. Born Sept. 1899. Died Jan. 1985.''   Steagall's paternal grandfather, Henry Farrar Steagall, was aTexan who served in Gen. Robert E. Lee's army and arrived in Brazilin 1866.   ``Wherever our ancestors settled, they were warmly welcomed,except at the local cemetery,'' said Judith MacKnight Jones, 75,the community's unofficial historian. She is one of the few whospeaks English, complete with a drawl.   ``They were not allowed to bury their dead in the Roman Catholiccemeteries because they were all Protestants, so they built thisone, which also serves as a monmument to our heritage,'' Mrs. Jonessaid, pointing to a concrete obelisk with four Confederate flagsengraved on it.   Sitting at a picnic table watching the square dance was SydneyMills, a large man in a cowboy hat, boots and leather vest, whocarried a riding crop. Mills, 73, is nicknamed ``The Texan.''   ``I've been dressing like this for more than 30 years as a wayto pay homage to my Confederate ancestors,'' Mills said inPortuguese. His grandfather, William Thatcher Mills, came fromDallas in 1866 to plant cotton in Santa Barbara D'Oeste.   Like Mills, most of the descendants know little of their familyhistories.   About 3,500 Southerners arrived between 1866 and 1890 to settlethis southeastern region, where the climate and soil are similar tothe southeastern United States. They introduced cotton, the metalplow and the sewing machine.   Many settlers could not adapt and nearly 3,000 returned to theUnited States by the turn of the century, Mrs. Jones said.   Most of the immigrants eventually moved to Americana, which grewup around the region's first railroad station, built in 1875. Thecity now is known for textile mills.   Today, Mrs. Jones said, no more than 300 of the people living inor near this city of 160,000 can trace their ancestry directly toConfederate immigrants.   The total number of descendants in Brazil is difficult to gauge,Some probably are unaware of their Confederate ancestry, otherswent elsewhere and there is no record of their numbers.   In 1967, Mrs. Jones chronicled the Confederate immigration inthe book ``Soldier Rest, A North American Epic Under BrazilianSkies.'' She wrote it in Portuguese, but hopes for an Englishtranslation.   Most of the Civil War exiles were plantation owners, she said,but the group included teachers, doctors, lawyers, businessmen andadventurers.   ``They came from all over the South: Alabama, Georgia, Texas,South Carolina and Mississippi,'' she said in an interview. ``Theyall felt conditions under Reconstruction would be unbearable, sothey decided to leave the old South and head for Brazil.''   The first immigrants arrived in 1866, drawn by reports fromAmerican Protestant missionaries and the Brazilian government thattheir knowledge of cotton farming was needed.   Another attraction was the abundant slave labor available inBrazil, Mrs. Jones said. Slavery was not abolished in Brazil until1888.   Initially, the transplanted Americans did not mix with the localresidents. Integration and intermarriage with Brazilians wasfrowned upon.   ``They had their own teachers, doctors, preachers and languageto protect their values from outside influences,'' Mrs. Jones said.   The self-imposed segregation began crumbling in the early 1900s.Grandchildren of the settlers married outside the community andbegan to mix with Brazilian culture.   Besides the yearly picnic, about 60 descendants meet every threemonths to keep in touch and exchange information on theirancestors.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thursday AMs Jan 3</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
