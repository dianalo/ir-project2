The quarter reflected cost-cutting and ATandamp;T's strong long-distance phone business. Full-year profit was the highest since the telecommunications giant shed the Bell companies, but the results still didn't meet the projections ATandamp;T made for 1984. The year also brought narrower losses from an ATandamp;T unit that sells computers.    ATandamp;T's quarterly profit equaled 46 cents a share, in line with many analysts' estimates. But it was disappointing to some who thought ATandamp;T could earn 50 cents a share, partly because its fourth-quarter tax rate was only 29%.    ATandamp;T closed at $28.875 a share, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    The 1986 fourth-quarter results were depressed by special charges and write-offs totaling $1.5 billion, or $1.41 a share. Without those charges, ATandamp;T said it would have earned 30 cents a share.    ATandamp;T executives said they were particularly pleased by a slight rise in fourth-quarter revenue to $8.6 billion from $8.53 billion. The rise indicates ATandamp;T may be building momentum for an acceleration in revenue growth this year, reversing a trend that began in 1986, said Robert M. Kavner, chief financial officer.    &quot;The fourth quarter is confirmation that we have been on the right track,&quot; Mr. Kavner said. &quot;We feel quite positive about 1988. We have the opportunity to continue our growth and earnings improvement.&quot;    For all of 1987, earnings jumped to $2.04 billion, or $1.88 a share, from $139 million, or five cents a share. Earnings in 1986 were depressed by $1.7 billion, or $1.59 a share, in special charges and write-offs. Revenue fell slightly to $33.6 billion from $34.1 billion. ATandamp;T told analysts in December it was quite possible it could meet estimates of $1.87 a share in 1987.    Nonetheless, ATandamp;T has yet to meet the estimate it made for 1984. &quot;They projected $2.02 a share in 1984, and they reported $1.25,&quot; said Richard Toole of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;In 1988, the company may exceed their earnings estimate for 1984.&quot; Maria Sbrilli of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. said profit margins and revenue were lower in the quarter than she expected, and she probably will cut her 1988 earnings estimate of $2.20 a share.    ATandamp;T may have effectively understated fourth-quarter profit through a larger-than-usual increase in advertising spending, said Jack Grubman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst. He said ATandamp;T wants to get regulatory relief in Washington that will help its long-distance business earn more, and &quot;showing bang-up earnings quarter after quarter isn't going to help ATandamp;T&quot; get such relief.    Mr. Kavner said, &quot;There is no connection&quot; between ATandamp;T lobbying efforts and the way it reports earnings.    He also said that while sales to businesses and consumers of the company's data products, including computers, slumped in the first half, they revived a bit in the second half, and the unit's sales were about flat for the year. Some other analysts think the unit's revenue fell. Mr. Kavner expects the data products business's revenue to grow this year.    ATandamp;T's earnings report makes clear that absent a regulatory change this year, the company must improve sales of computer and communications equipment to outside customers other than the Bell companies if it is to report substantially improved revenue and earnings.    &quot;We walk into 1988 with a plan of growth in product volumes&quot; aside from equipment sold to the Bells, a sector where revenue will be &quot;stable&quot; with 1987, Mr. Kavner said.    Mr. Kavner indicated he doesn't expect pretax operating profit margins on ATandamp;T's products to change much this year from the 41.2% margin of 1987. Last year's product profit margins were much higher than the 29.3% of 1986 because the earlier year included unusually large inventory write-offs, Mr. Kavner said.    ATandamp;T expects its rental revenue to keep falling and its long-distance business to grow with the market, despite price cuts this month, Mr. Kavner said. Last year long-distance revenue grew 2.9%, despite price reductions of 16%, and calling volume rose 8%, the company said. International and &quot;800&quot; service volume grew by double digits. </TEXT></DOC>
