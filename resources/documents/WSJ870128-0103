Storage Technology, which still is struggling to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings, is in &quot;the mop-up phase of a major financial reorganization,&quot; Ryal Poppa, chairman and chief executive officer, said at a news conference here. He predicted that orders this year will be &quot;up substantially,&quot; and said financing needs will be met with internal cash flow, though he is arranging a $50 million credit line with a Denver bank &quot;as a backup.&quot;    While Mr. Poppa didn't mention it directly, a dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission over accounting irregularities was settled later in the day, the SEC announced. The SEC's charges of fraud and &quot;misleading&quot; accounting covered 1982 to 1984, before the company was forced into bankruptcy-law reorganization and before Mr. Poppa joined it in a turnaround bid.    In the news conference, held to introduce the product, Mr. Poppa said all pending lawsuits will be resolved in 45 to 60 days and that a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service is expected to be resolved in the current quarter.    A bankruptcy judge has ruled that Storage Technology owes about $22.8 million to the IRS. However, the IRS claims it owes several times that amount and has indicated that it will appeal the ruling in federal district court. The company said it is negotiating to settle the disagreement.    The 4400, the new system from Storage Technology, Louisville, Colo., is similar to an IBM machine that came out about two years ago. It stores data on hand-sized tape cartridges instead of reels of tape about the size of a long-playing record album.    But while other tape systems use big filing rooms and require a person to retrieve tapes by hand -- a process that takes two to five minutes -- the new Storage Technology product cuts retrieval time to 11 seconds by using a unique robot arm that operates inside a huge, cylindrical &quot;library&quot; holding as many as 6,000 cartridges.    Company executives say they don't expect IBM, the source of fierce competition that was a major factor in the vendor's financial collapse two years ago, to produce a robot-library system.    But major obstacles remain. The new system hasn't yet been tested by customers and won't be delivered in its complete form until the fourth quarter, at the earliest. The robot-library device, which itself costs $243,500 and works with other equipment priced at more than $60,000, also won't fit IBM tape drives. That means customers at about 2,500 IBM-oriented sites must get rid of IBM equipment to switch over to Storage Technology.    According to yesterday's announcement regarding the SEC lawsuit, Storage Technology settled the charges without admitting or denying any misconduct. The company consented to an injunction against future violations of the securities laws.    The SEC charges included premature booking of revenue from sales of data-storage equipment. In federal court in Washington, the SEC said the company presented a &quot;misleading picture&quot; of its operating results from 1982 to the third quarter of 1984. The SEC alleged that the company had violated generally accepted accounting principles by recognizing revenue when products were shipped rather than when payments by customers were received.    As previously reported, after the company's management changed in early 1985, it took a $16.2 million special charge to reflect a change in accounting for sales. That decision came two months after the SEC said it was investigating the company's revenue-recognition policies.    The SEC also had charged the company with backdating a major transaction in the 1983 third quarter and recognizing it as second-quarter revenue. The 1983 second quarter was Storage Technology's last profitable quarter before it sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in October 1984.    According to the SEC's complaint, Storage Technology's business took a downturn in early 1982 when its principal competitor, IBM, began selling a new disk drive with twice as much data-storage capacity as Storage Technology's disk drive.    Also that year, a large number of Storage Technology's disk drives that had been sold during three prior years when the company had strong earnings began to malfunction. In addition, production problems forced Storage Technology to delay until early 1984 the marketing of a comparable disk drive to compete with IBM's.    Increasingly beleaguered, Storage Technology recognized revenue before payment was &quot;reasonably assured&quot; and before its disk drives, tape drives and printers were installed, the SEC said. On average, such products weren't installed until 44 days after the shipping date.    The agency also charged that the company failed to keep accurate books and records and failed to maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. </TEXT></DOC>
