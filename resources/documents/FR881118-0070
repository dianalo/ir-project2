Said project owners are required, by legislation and regulations,to obtain HUD approval for rent increases.1. In return for our insuring, subsidizing or making direct loans for projectmortgages, owners agree to: (1) Let HUD regulate rents; (2) purchase goodsand services on terms most advantageous to the project; and (3) assurethat project expenses are reasonable. Tying rents to costs helps HUD assurethat rent levels and related Federal subsidy outlays are not higher thanneeded to support operations and to pay a reasonable return on the owner'sinvestment. HUD's authority to require owners to submit documentation supportinga rental increase request are contained in Pub. L. 479, 48 Stat. 1246,Sect. 207 and 24 CFR 207.19. Attachments include a copy of the worksheetand the spread sheet.2. Worksheet: Project owners enter actual operating expenses on the BudgetWorksheet and project the increase or decrease in expenses expected duringthe next 12 month period. Consideration of historical operating costs isthe best starting point for estimating future expense levels. In supportof the estimated expenses, owners must also attach a brief narrative tothe Worksheet explaining how each expense estimate was derived where itexceeds 5 percent. A sample owner explanation is included in this package.Field Staff assess the reasonableness of estimated expenses using lineby line guidance provided by Headquarters then, calculate the project'srent potential and spread the rent potential by bedroom size.Without the worksheet, HUD would be unable to carry out the regulationwhich authorizes use of anticipated expenses for setting project rents.Establishing rents based on expected expense levels helps assure that:(1) HUD tenant assistance outlays are no higher than necessary; and (2)rents are sufficient to cover ongoing expenses and project debt service.Insufficient rent potential could result in mortgage assignments costingthe government millions of dollars in mortgage insurance claims.Spread Sheet: Project owners enter information on current unit sizes, currentrents and utility allowances and requested rent increase levels on thespread sheet. This basic information along with the projections on theworksheet is required to calculate the nature of any rent increase.3. We encourage the use of automated accounting systems when the cost ofthe system is less than the cost of hiring a project bookkeeper. Many managementagents now use privately developed software packages adapted to the HUDChart of Accounts. These systems significantly reduce the time needed toestablish amounts included on the Budget Worksheet. Some automated systemsalso compare actual project expenses against monthly budget expense projections.This information is useful to owners when estimating expense levels onthe worksheet. Field Offices may accept automated reports in lieu of theWorksheet or the Spread Sheet as long as the entries are grouped in thecategories used in the respective forms and the owner clearly identifieswhich accounts are included on each line.4. The requirements for the information on these forms are not duplicatedby requirements imposed by other regulatory or State and local governments.5. Worksheet: Estimated project expenses and rent potential spread shownon the HUD-worksheet is not available to HUD from other sources. The informationmust be derived or estimated from project books and records kept by theowner. Only the owner can provide this information because he/she is mostaware of inflationary increases in project expense levels or increasesin service contracts executed on behalf of the project.Spread Sheet: The estimated rent potential shown on the Spread Sheet isnot available to HUD from other sources. As in the case of the worksheetthe information must be estimated from project books and records kept bythe owner. The owner is the sole best source of this information.6. No small business or other small entities are involved in this informationcollection.7. Information is collected only when the owner requests a rental increase.Without the Worksheet or the Spread Sheet HUD would be less able to considerthe owner's input in rent increase processing. Project rents may be setat inflated levels resulting in excessive subsidy outlays or at insufficientlevels potentially resulting in a mortgage assignment.It should be noted that information is collected on the Spread Sheet onlywhen the owner requests a rental increase and the project is not subjectto tenant participation requirements of 24 CFR Part 245. Thus the SpreadSheet is not required in every case that the Budget Worksheet is required.8. Information collection is conducted in a manner consistent with theguidelines of 5 CFR 1320.6.9. Over the past several years, we have been discussing with the housingindustry and HUD Field Offices how we could improve rent increase processingprocedures for subsidized and cooperative projects. In a previous submission(1987) for the OMB approval of the form HUD-92457B we mentioned some ofindustry contacts we made to discuss rent increase processing. All of theserepresentatives supported the new forward budget approach and the automatedcalculation of rents. They appreciated the need to gather expense dataprojections from project owners.In addition to contacts made in 1987 (see below) the Department is carryingon continuing discussions with the National Association of HUD ManagementAgents, The National Corporation of Housing Partnerships and The NationalHousing Partnership.<ITAG tagnum="15">Dan Grady, Monfric, Inc., 1915 Morena Blvd, San Diego, CA 92110, (619)276-6271.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Barron Rush, CPM, Barron Builders and Management Company, 18333 EgretBay Blvd, Suite 680, Houston, Texas 77058, (713) 333-5211.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Charles A.

The Rent Increase Budget Worksheet and the Rent Increase Spread Sheetwill be used to implement the Department's policy of basing rent increaseson estimated future expenses. This method replaces the previous policyand the form which it utilized. Specifically, HUD form 92457B (OMB Controlandplusmin; 2502-0324) will no longer be used to process rent increases forthe projects effected by the new approach. Therefore, the approval of theseforms represents a net reduction in paperwork burden hours for those projects.<ITAG tagnum="15">Previous burden hours approved for the HUD 92457B: 50,000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Requested total burden hours for the new Worksheet and Spread Sheet:25,750</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Net reduction in hours: 24,250</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Annual cost to the Federal Government for the HUD 92457B: $412,500</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Net reduction in cost for the new forms: $120,000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Annual cost to respondents for the HUD 92457B: $651,875</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Net reduction in cost for respondents with the new forms: $315,062</ITAG>15.

Processing Budgeted Rent Increases and Fees for CommercialSpace and Services in Insured, Direct Loan and Non-regulated HUD projects</ITAG>Section1. Overview1. <T3>Purpose.</T3> This chapter provides procedures for processing budgetedrent increases in certain HUD projects and outlines guidance in the calculationof utility allowances and charges for commercial facilities and servicesprovided in those projects. Included in the chapter are the relevant tenantparticipation procedures which must be followed in processing these increasesand charges. In preparing the procedures in this chapter, HUD's prime interestis in promoting the efficient management and continued financial viabilityof its projects. In reviewing requests from owners concerning rents andcharges, the Field Office should be guided by the fact that these rentsand fees should and must provide sufficient and adequate funding to operatethe projects. This chapter gives guidance on program evaluation used inconjunction with required procedures for MIPS budgeted rent increases.2. <T3>Applicability.</T3> These procedures for processing a gross potentialrent increase, increases in charges for commercial space and charges forservices apply to the projects listed below:A. Section 231, 232 and 221(d)(3) market rate projects: 231 projects (LDs)whose rents are still controlled or who have opted for the alternate rentmechanism.B. Section 202 projects, except those that use the Section 8 Annual AdjustmentFactor (AAF).C. Section 213, Section 236 (including cooperatives), Rent Supplement,221(d)(3) market rate and 221(d)(3) BMIR rental and cooperative projects,Sections 810 and 908 (military housing);D. Projects that have converted from Rent Supplement to Section 8 LoanManagement Set-Aside;E. Previously HUD-owned projects that have been sold to nonprofit ownersor that use a budget (rather than the Section 8 AAF) to compute rents;F. Section 207's and 231's both regulated and controlled by alternativerent mechanism; Section 220 and 221(d)(4)'s that are regulated; and 234rentals that did not convert to condominiums;G. Those projects listed in paragraph 2(A) through (F) that are not automaticallypreempted by HUD and request exemption from local rent control.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Regulatory agreements require Section 202, Section 231 andcooperative projects to <T3>annually</T3> submit operating budgets and obtain HUD approval of rentsor carrying charges. Field Offices shall enforce this requirement in lieuof the requirement that budgets be submitted only when the owner believesa rent increase is needed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Field Office in enforcing the regulatory agreement requirementfor annual budget submissions, shall require the owner to include in theirsubmission any information required by Section 4, paragraph 2 of theseprocedures.</ITAG>3. <T3>Projects Subject to the Alternate Rent Determination Mechanism.</T3>For projects insured under Section 207, 231(c)(4), 213 Rental 223(f), and234 Rental prior to November 30, 1983, and for 221(d)(4) projects, regardlessof when the project was insured, the owners may request an amendment tothe Regulatory Agreement subject to Section 3 of this chapter requiringHUD to determine their rents using the alternative rent mechanism describedin Section 4.4. <T3>Definitions.</T3>A. <T3>HUD Authorized Rent.</T3> These are the unit rents shown in column3 of the most recently approved Rent Schedule (Form HUD-92458). In theSection 236 program these rents are called basic rents. Depending on income,some 236 tenants will pay market rent or something between basic and marketrents which represents 30 percent of adjusted income.B. <T3>Maximum Allowable Rent Potential.</T3> The maximum annual rent theowner may collect by charging the rents authorized by HUD on the Form 92458.C. <T3>Utility Allowance.</T3> (APPLIES ONLY FOR PROJECTS RECEIVING SUBSIDYASSISTANCE WHERE ALL OR SOME UTILITIES ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE TENANT).An estimate of utility costs (except telephone) for an average family occupyinga unit.Clarification: Section 221(d)(3) DMIR projects that were built with tenantpaid utilities (separate meters) do not need utility allowances. If theproject has Rent Supplement or LMSA units, those units however, receivean allowance.D. <T3>Section 8 Contract Rents. </T3>The rent level called for under thesubsidy contract and adjusted annually subject to comparability. Rent usedfor units subsidized under Section 8 New Construction (880), SubstantialRehabilitation (881) and Section 8 (LMSA) where the owner has had his rentdecontrolled or used the alternative rent mechanism.E. <T3>Services. </T3>This refers to such benefits as may be provided by theproject owner to tenants that are not included in the rent and are optionalon the tenant's part (i.e. cable T.V., laundry facilities and use of communityspace in the project.)Section 2. Tenant Comment Procedures for a Rent Increase1. <T3>General. </T3>Tenant comment procedures for the rent increase processare provided for in Section 202(b)(1) of the 1978 Housing and CommunityDevelopment Amendments (HCDA) and Section 329(F) of the 1981 HCDA. Regulationsat 24 CFR 245 set the Department's policy on the subject (See Appendix1). These requirements for tenant comment on rent increases and utilityallowance reductions apply to all projects listed in Paragraph 2 exceptthose rentals under Section 207, 213, 234, Section 231, 220 and Section221(d)(4). They also do not affect cooperatives whose residents elect aBoard of Directors which must approve any proposed increase in carryingcharges. This mechanism more than provides a means of comment in the managementof the project.2. <T3>Applicability. </T3>The requirements of this section affect ONLY thoseowners whose requested rent potential would <T3>exceed </T3>the Maximum Allowable Rent Potential for that project.If the proposed rent potential is less than or equal to the Maximum AllowableRent Potential, the tenant comment procedures outlined in this sectiondo NOT apply. (See Section 4.)3. <T3>Owner Responsibilities: </T3>Owners must issue a Notice to Tenantsof any proposed rent increase. The Notice must contain all of the informationincluded in the sample notice shown in the Appendix 1. Initial submissionof the request to HUD for a rent increase shall go forward at the sametime as the Notice is being given to tenants. The HUD Field Office shallreceive a copy of the Notice to Tenants along with the documents and informationthat will be used to justify the rent increase as part of formal rent increaserequest.A. For high-rise projects, owners must ``post'' <T3>or </T3>``deliver'' the Notice to each tenant. For all other typesof projects, owner need only ``deliver'' the Notices.B. <T3>Delivery. </T3>A copy of the Notice must be mailed to each tenant orhand carried directly to each unit. <T4>Important: </T4>The Notice should also be delivered to those tenantswho pay market rent and to tenants who would not be affected by an increasebecause they pay a percentage of income.C. <T3>Posting. </T3>If applicable, the owner must post the Notice in at leastthree conspicuous places in each high-rise building in which dwelling unitsare located AND in one conspicuous place at the address where the materialsupporting the owner's request will be available for tenant review andcopying. <T4>Important: </T4>Owners must keep the posted Notices in place and inlegible form for the tenant comment period.4. <T3>Tenant Review and Comment. </T3>During the 30 days following the datethe Notice to Tenants was given, the owner must make all of the materialslisted in Section 4, paragraph 2 plus any additional information used tojustify the increase available to tenants or their representatives to reviewand/or copy. For the purposes of computing tenant comment periods, ownersmust consider the date the Notice was given to be the date by which allnotices had been hand-carried or mailed and all required copies had beeninitially posted. The materials must be available at least during normalbusiness hours and at a place reasonably convenient to the tenants.5. <T3>Comment Submission. </T3>Tenants may submit written comments on theincrease request to the owner or to the HUD Field Office or both. In caseswhere comments are submitted to the owner, all such comments must be reviewedand evaluated. The comments and evaluations should then be forwarded tothe HUD Field Office as part of the formal rent increase request.6. <T3>Changes to Supporting Documentation. </T3>If during the 30-day commentperiod the owner makes a material change in any of the documents submittedin support of the increase, the owner must notify the tenants of the change(s)in a notice to be distributed in the <T3>exact </T3>same manner as the original Notice to Tenants. The ownermust make the revised materials available for the tenants to review and/orcopy for the LONGER of 15 days after the revised notice was given or thedays remaining in the initial 30-day comment period.7. <T3>Submitting the Formal Request for an Increase. </T3>At the conclusionof the tenant comment period as defined in either paragraph 4 or paragraph6 above the owner must forward in addition to the tenant comments and evaluations,an executed copy of the owner's Certification as to Compliance with 24CFR Part 245's Review and Comment Procedures. (See Appendix 2)Section 3_Decontrol of Rents1. <T3>Decontrol of Section 220/221. </T3>On April 19, 1983 the Departmentissued regulations (effective 6/1/83) which changed the requirements forHUD control of rents and other charges in Section 207, 220, and 221(d)(4).First, HUD used the discretion it already had under Sections 220 and 221(d)(4)to decontrol rent and other charges in unassisted projects. Regulationwould continue only for projects receiving certain types of Section 8 assistance,projects receiving Section 8 LMSA and projects insured under Section 221(d)(3).The regulation of certain charges for facilities and services continuedfor each of these units and projects, as well as for Section 221(d)(4)elderly and handicapped projects. Second, HUD implemented the AlternativeRent Mechanism (discussed in Section 4 of this chapter) for determiningmaximum allowable rents for unsubsidized projects insured under Sections207, 213 (rental), 223(f), 231(c)(4) and 234 (rental).2. <T3>HURRA of 1983. </T3>In November 1983, Section 431(a)(1) of the Housingand Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 amended section 207(b)(2) of the Nationalhousing Act (NHA) to make discretionary the Secretary's authority to regulaterents and other charges for multifamily housing projects insured underSection 207 on or after November 30, 1983. The owner needed only to submitan amended regulatory agreement and HUD would sign it.3. <T3>Decontrol of Section 207. </T3>Exercising the discretion granted bythe change in 431(a)(1), the Department implemented regulations on June4, 1986 (effective 7/21/86) which deregulated rents and other charges formortgages insured under Section 207 on or after November 30, 1983. Regulationcontinued for Section 236 subsidized projects refinanced under Section223(f). HUD also authorized owners of 221(d)(4) and 220 projects with LMSAto decontrol rents provided they amended the Regulatory agreement and tohave its Section 8 rents determined annually by the applicable annual adjustmentsfactor.4. <T3>Section 207/LMSA. </T3>For those projects insured before November 30,1983, the 1986 regulations gave Section 207, 220, and 221(d)(4) projectowners receiving Section 8 LMSA assistance the option to request the AlternativeRent Mechanism, provided they agree to amend the Regulatory agreement,and have the Section 8 rents determined by the applicable annual adjustmentfactor.5. <T3>1987 Housing Act.</T3> The Housing Act of 1987 imposed restrictionson the decontrol of rent and use of the alternative rent mechanism whichaffected owners who had not requested changes in their regulatory agreements.For those owners whose request for a regulatory change was received before12/1/87, HUD will process the request and sign the new agreement. However,for owners of projects who were eligible under the 1983/86 regulationsBUT who did not request the necessary amendment prior to 12/1/87, the Actrequires that the project meet the following tests before the amendmentcan be approved: (1) The project may not have a project-based Section 8contract; and (2) no more than 50 percent of its tenants can be definedas lower income.6. <T3>Projects Not Covered by the Act.</T3> Projects endorsed and insured(or co-insured on or after 11/30/83 under Section 207 and 223 are NOT coveredby the 1987 Housing Act. This is notwithstanding any language presentlycontained in the regulatory agreement.7. <T3>Projects Covered by the Act.</T3> The Field Office will apply the testsrequired in the 1987 Act to:(A) Unsubsidized Section 207, 213(rental), 223(f), 231(c)(4), and 234(rental)projects that could have elected the Alternative Rent Mechanism under theApril 1, 1983 rule, but did not do so before 12/1/87.(B) Unsubsidized 220 ands 221(d)(4) projects insured prior to 6/1/83 whocould have elected to deregulate charges for rents, facilities, or servicesunder April 19, 1983 rule, but did not do so before 12/1/87.(C) Section 207, 213(rental), 223(f), 231(c)(4), and 234(rental), 220 and221(d)(4) projects insured prior to 11/30/83 and assisted by Section 8LMSA that were permitted by the June 4, 1986 regulation to request theAlternative Rent Mechanism or decontrol as applicable, but did not do sobefore 12/1/87.8. <T3>Special Cases.</T3> HUD continues to regulate a certain limited classof projects which would otherwise be eligible under regulations to requestdecontrol. This group consists of those projects discussed in this Sectionwhere the mortgagor opts to remain controlled in order to maintain theproject's tax exempt status and those projects where deregulation wouldresult in the imposition of local and state rent control which is inapplicableas long as HUD is regulating the rent. In both cases the maximum permissiblerent charges are determined by the Alternative Rent Mechanism.9. <T3>PMMs.</T3> Regulation of rents at projects with Purchase Money Mortgagessold with insurance will be in accordance with the rules for Section 221(d)(4).Section 4. Owner Request for a Rent Increase1. <T3>Procedures for Requesting a Rent Increase.</T3> Owners are allowedto charge only the rents shown on the rent schedule they submitted andwhich have most recently been authorized by HUD. When current rent levelsare NOT sufficient to cover anticipated or unavoidable increases in operatingcosts, owners should request that HUD approve an increase in rents. Ifthe increase in proposed potential rent is less than or equal to the MaximumAllowable Rent Potential, owners need only submit a new Rent Schedule 92458.Tenant comment procedures in 24 CFR Part 245 do NOT apply. If the HUD Formproposed rent increase exceeds the Maximum Allowable Rent Potential, ownersmust take the actions discussed in this Section.2. <T3>Initial Submission.</T3> In addition to the proposed rent potential,the initial submission to request a rent increase should include the materialslisted below, plus any additional documents being used to support the request.A. A cover letter that briefly does all of the following:(1) Summarizes the reasons why a rent increase is needed and the date theincrease will be effective. Describe the project's physical condition andany improvements that have been budgeted for. The letter may refer to thereasons stated in the Notice or elaborate on those reasons. (The main reasonsstated in the letter must be the same as the main reasons stated in theNotice to Tenants, if the project was subject to the tenant comment proceduresin Section 2.)(2) Identifies any proposed change in services, equipment or charges andthe reasons for the change.B. A budget worksheet (Appendix 4(e) format) providing income and expensesfor the 12 months following the anticipated effective date of the proposedrent increase. Owners not subject to tenant comment procedures will alsosubmit the Budget Sheet found in Appendix 4(c) which outlines rent structure.(Project owners subject to the tenant comment procedures of CFR Part 245will have already provided rent structure information when they forwardedHUD a copy of their Notice to Tenants (see Section 2, paragraph 3.)C. A brief statement explaining the basis for any increase in the expenseline items on the budget work sheet. Generally, if an increase amountsto 5 percent or more, it must be documented. If the income or expense wasestimated at the prior annual period's actual, or the increase is lessthan $500, no explanation is required. (Appendix 4(b) provides a sampleowner explanation of budget items.)D. Where applicable, a copy of the Notice to Tenants annotated to showwhere and how the Notice was distributed (e.g., posted, mailed, hand carried).E. An executed copy of the Owner's Certification Regarding Purchasing Practicesand Reasonableness of Expenses (Appendix 3).F. A status report on the project's implementation of its current EnergyConservation Plan (See Chapter 12). This may be: (1) A narrative reportcoded to facilitate references to the plan; or (2) copy of the plan annotatedto show the current status of all items that were scheduled to be completedwithin 60 days after the rent increase is proposed to be effective. THISAPPLIES ONLY TO SECTION 236 AND BMIR PROJECTS, PROJECTS THAT RECEIVE RENTSUPPLEMENT ASSISTANCE, AND PROJECTS THAT CONVERTED FROM RENT SUPPLEMENTTO SECTION 8. This requirement is to assure compliance with Section 329(c)of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981.G. A signed request for an increase in the Reserve for Replacement if suchan increase is contemplated as part of the rent increase request (Appendix7).H. <T3>For Projects with Utility Allowances,</T3> a recommendation is to whatutility allowance is appropriate for each unit type and a summary of howthe owner/agent arrived at that amount with appropriate documentation asprescribed by paragraph 4 of this section.3. <T3>Use of the Alternate Rent Mechanism. </T3>For projects insured underSection 207, 231(c)(4), 213 Rental, 234 Rental, 223(f) and 221(d)(4), wherethe necessary amendment to the regulatory agreement has been executed (SeeSection 3), owners may request that HUD determine a rent increase usingthe Alternative Rent Mechanism. These steps are to be followed:A. <T3>Owner Submission for Alternative Rent Determination Mechanism.</T3>In addition to the information required in Section 4, paragraph 2, theowner who chooses the Alternative Rent Determination process must submitthe following:(1) Appraisal of the value of the property performed by a qualified realestate appraiser of the mortgagor's choice which includes the comparablerents for units in similar projects.(2) A request for HUD approval of a rent increase.B. <T3>Processing Procedures for Budgeted Rent Determination.</T3>(1) Section 207, 231, 213, 220, 221(d)(4) owners or owners of projectswhich are required to have their rents approved by HUD, who do not chooseto use the Alternative Rent Determination procedures will continue to havetheir rents determined as prescribed in this chapter and no RegulatoryAgreement amendment is necessary.(2) Section 207 owners or owners of projects who require HUD approval ofrents or owners of projects who otherwise could chose not to have HUD controlrents, that wish to use the Alternative Rent Determination Procedures providedfor, shall have their rents determined by HUD based on the submission requiredin paragraph 3(A) of this section. HUD will approve the lower of the folloiwingtwo rent potentials: (1) Apply the original debt service factor to thecurrent market appraisal covering the residential value of the property.Then process the rents as outlined in this chapter, to determine GrossPotential Rent; or the comparable rents submitted as part of the appraisal.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The independent organization or person hired by the ownerto conduct and provide the certified appraisal must be a rcognized professionalappraiser. The appraiser in making his/her rental analysis must determinethe residential rental income separate from the commercial income and providea delienation in the value of the residential portion separate from thecommercial portion of the value. The Field Office in determining the GrossPotential Rents using the new appraisal will use the residential rent portionof the certified appraisal to apply the original debt service factor setat the time of final endorsement in determining the new debt service allowedin the rent computation and insert the new appraised residential valuein Box H of the Rent Calculation Worksheet. Offices shall follow outstandinginstructions contained in this chapter in processing the expenses usedin determining the final Gross Potential Rent.</ITAG>C. <T3>HUD's Approval of Alternative Rent Increase Method.</T3>(1) Based on the analysis submitted and assuming the owner is otherwiseeligible for a rent increase as covered in this chapter, the Loan ManagementBranch Chief (LMBC) shall approve in writing the lesser of the rents computedin paragraph 3(B)(2) of this section.(2) If the LMBC determines that the owner is not entitled to a rent increaseas covered in this Handbook, the LMBC shall submit the finding(s) to theDirector of Housing Management or Director of Housing for review. The Directorwill deny or approve the LMBC finding in writing providing the reasonsfor the final decision if it reverses or alters the LMBC recommendation.D. <T3>Future Processing After Initial Determination of Rents Using AlternativeMechanism.</T3>(1) If the rent based on comparables and supported by the appraisal asdefined in paragraph 3(B)(2) are less than the processed rent utilizingthe appraised value, use the comparable rents submitted by the owner asthe approved rent. The Field Office in NOT to become involved in determiningcomparable rents. This should already have been done as part of the appraisalpackage.(2) If the budgeted rents in paragraph 3(B)(2) using the most recent appraisaland budgeted operating costs are less than comparable rents, the bugetedrent level shall be approved. For future requests, continue this processuntil such time as the comparable rents are less than budgeted rents. Whenthis happens, the comparable rents shall be approved as the Rent Level.(3) As long as the owner submits a comparable Rent Level which is lessor equal to the rent level that would be provided using the last appraisedvalue in determining rents as described in paragraph 3(B)(2) of this Section,a new appraisal is not required. However, when the comparable rents exceedthe rents allowed using the last appraised value, then the owner must eithersubmit a new appraisal showing that the rents based on the appraisal aremore than the rents based on comparables in order to charge the comparablerents or he/she must charge the rent as determined by using the new appraisalwhich is less than the comparables.E. <T3>Thirty Day Processing of Alternative Rent.</T3>The LMBC must (in writing) approve, disapprove or approve for a differentamount requested by the owner, within 30 days of receipt. Failure on therpart of the LMBC to notify the owner in writing of the findings will providetemporary authority to the owner to charge the proposed rents. In the eventthat the owner implemented the rents at the end of 30 days without HUD'swritten approval, the additional rents shall be placed in an escrow accountor a letter of credit shall be provided so that in the event HUD failsto approve the rent increase, or approves the increase for less than requested,the owner shall immediately return to the tenants that portion of the rentcollected which HUD later disapproved. <T3>This applies only to rents processed using the alternative rent mechanism.</T3>F. <T3>Allowable Project Costs.</T3>While the cost of the appraisal and/or market analysis can be paid forout of project income, it is not to be used as an allowable project expensein the rent determination defined in Section 5 of this chapter.4. <T3>Determination of a Utility Allowance.</T3> (see Section 1, para 4Cfor applicability) For each request for an increase in the HUD-authorizedrent potential, the owner must recommend an utility allowance for eachunit type. The recommended utility allowance should represent the owner'sbest estimate of the average monthly utility cost that an energy consciousresident will incur for the year. The utility allowance is not meant topay all actual utility costs, but rather it is to reimburse a prudent utilityconsumer for their utility expense. Both the proposed and the current allowancelevels should be included in the notices to the tenants.A. As part of the submission for an increase or decrease in the utilityallowance, each owner must submit a summary supporting the proposed changeto the utility allowance. That summary should:(1) Identify the type of utilities covered by the utility allowance (e.g.,gas for heating).(2) State whether any utility rate increases or decreases where implementedduring the past 12 months or are expected to be implemented during thenext 12 months and the amount of those increases or decreases.(3) State how any energy conservation initiatives have or will impact consumption.B. In addition, the owner must request HUD approval of revised utilityallowances whenever a utility rate change would cause a cumulative increaseof 10 percent or more in the most recently approved utility allowances.C. Owners must recommend additional utility allowances if the project'sdesign is such that utility costs will vary significantly for units ofthe same size (e.g., end units vs. interior units).5. <T3>Field Management of the Rent Request Process. </T3>HUD Field Officesmust establish a tracking system that will facilitate and monitor compliancewith the following processing times:A. <T3>When the Proposed Potential does NOT exceed the Maximum Potential.</T3>In these instances, the Field Office need only review the proposedutility allowances and the Rent Schedule. Field staff should complete theseactions and return the signed Form 92458 within 10 working days of receivingthe owner's request.B. <T3>When the Rent Increase Exceeds the Maximum Potential</T3>.(1) <T3>All Projects. </T3>The Field Office should check the completeness ofthe owners' initial submission within 5 working days of its receipt. Doingso will expedite any required reposting and reduce processing delays.(2) <T3>Projects NOT subject to 24 CFR Part 245 Tenant Comment requirements.</T3>Complete these reviews and issue a decision letter within 30 daysafter receipt of all materials required by Section 4, paragraph 2.(3) <T3>Projects subject to 24 CFR Tenant Comment procedures. </T3>Issue decisionletters within 30 days after receipt of the formal rent increase requestwhich includes the tenant comments and other materials required by Section2, paragraph 7. Final approval cannot take place before the tenant commentperiod has ended.C. <T3>Check the completeness of the Owner's Initial Submission. </T3>Within5 working days of receipt of the owner's initial submission, answer thefollowing questions where applicable.(1) Does the Notice to Tenants contain all of the information includedin the sample notice in Appendix 1? If it doesn't, require the owner torevise the Notice and distribute it as directed.(2) Has the owner submitted ALL of the materials required by Section 4,paragraph 2? If not, do the following.(a) Call the owner/agent and ask them to submit the missing materials andfollow up in writing.(b) Be sure the missing materials are made available for any required tenantreview. (See Section 2, paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.)D. You may NOT require that projects routinely submit materials NOT listedin Section 4, paragraph 2. You may require additional submissions ONLYif the actual or projected expense estimates appear to be excessive andthe narrative without additional information, cannot support requestedexpense levels. Special requests should only be made in cases where estimateswill have significant monetary impact on the authorized rent potential.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>Your requests for additional information must be made inwriting and within 30 days of receipt of initial package. The owner mustdistribute a second Notice to tenants and comply with Section 2, paragraph6 where applicable. Be flexible, consider the needs of the project tenantsand protection of government interest before requesting additional information.</ITAG>6. <T3>Seasonal Rents</T3>.A. <T3>Housing programs of HUD contemplate </T3>relatively permanent occupancyat rents within the ceilings established for year-round occupancy, henceseasonal rents are not generally in accord with the objectives of thoseprograms. In particular, occupancy charges at seasonal rates would be inconsistentwith the objectives for which projects are built for cooperative use orfor use by families of low and moderate income, or for elderly occupants.In the case of elderly housing projects, there may be isolated instancesin which seasonal rates would be in order.B. <T3>Conversely, in areas where seasonal rents are customary, </T3>theremay be rental housing projects which are likely to be in financial difficultybecause year-round occupancy cannot be maintained. In such circumstances,HUD will not object to the establishment of seasonal rents for a temporaryperiod provided that:(1) With respect to all units in the project, preference at all times willbe given to permanent tenants at the established year-round rental rate.(2) None of the units in the project will be rented for a period of lessthan 30 days.(3) There will be no increase in existing maximum permissible gross rentby reason of seasonal rates being allowed, and as to the individual units,the aggregate gross rent collected during any fiscal year should not exceedthe established maximum rent.C. <T3>If examination of the project operations </T3>supports the need forseasonal rents, the Housing Management Division (or Insuring Office) Directorwill grant approval in the form of a letter agreement which shall definethe number and type of units so covered, and shall evidence the mortgagor'sacceptance of the foregoing conditions under which approval is given. Deviationsfrom the terms under which approval was obtained will operate to breachthe agreement.7. <T3>BMIR Rents Paid by Over-Income Tenants. </T3>HUD-91709, Schedule ofComputation of Rental Income in Excess of BMIR Rent Paid by Over-IncomeTenants, is a monthly schedule to be completed by BMIR mortgagors in orderto compute the amount of rent in excess of BMIR rent paid by over-incometenants and available for credit to the residual receipts account. Thecompleted form shall be used by Housing Management Division personnel andproject accountants to arrive at this amount without having to review allof the project's records by lease, Form HUD-91705, etc. This will not,however, eliminate the need to spot-check these records when determinednecessary to assure correctness of the schedule. Unless requested by HUD,this form is retained as a part of the mortgagor's record.8. <T3>Section 236 Projects, Rents Collected in Excess of Basic Rent. </T3>Forall types of Section 236 projects, including noninsured projects (see Circular4530.1, dated 2-7-73), the Regulatory Agreement or the Interest ReductionContract provide that, subsequent to the commencement of the term of theInterest Reduction Contract, the project owner shall remit each month directlyto the Billing and Receivable Division, Office of Finance and Accounting,Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, D.C. 20410, togetherwith the appropriate reporting form, the amount by which the total rentalscollected on the dewelling units exceed the sum of the approved basic rentalsfor all occupied units. The prescribed reporting form, Monthly Report ofExcess Income, Form HUD-93104, page 1 for insured and Secretary-held projects,and Form HUD-93104A, page 1 for noninsured projects, must be submittedby the tenth of each month, whether or not a remittance is required.A. <T3>Determining the Amount of Excess Income. </T3>In order to determinethe amount of excess income, if any, which must be remitted to HUD, theproject owner must prepare page 2 of Form HUD-93104 (or Form 93104A), asof the end of the reporting month, or have the same information shown onthis detailed schedule readily available from some other source, such asa computer print-out sheet. This schedule must be attached to the retainedcopy of page 1, Form HUD-93104 (or HUD-93104A), and made available, uponrequest, for audit by HUD or the Comptroller General of the United States.B. <T3>Collecting Excess Rentals Prior to the Commencement of the InterestReduction Contract. </T3>Any excess rentals collected prior to the commencementof the term of the Interest Reduction Contract shall not be treated asa return of subsidy to HUD but as regular project income. C. <T3>Adhering to Excess Income Requirements. </T3>The Section 236 law statesthat the project owner ``* * * shall accumulate, safeguard, and periodicallypay to the Secretary all rental charges collected in excess of the basicrental charges.'' HUD's continued payment of interest reduction subsidyto the mortgagee is contingent on the owner's strict adherence to programrequirements. Should an owner fail to submit to HUD by the 10th of thereporting month page 1 of Form HUD-93104 or HUD-93104A together with anyamount due, the following steps shall be taken: (1) The Multifamily Mortgage Branch, Office of Finance and Accounting,shall send to the mortgagor a demand letter, and one follow-up letter ifno answer is received within 15 days. Copies of these letters shall besent to the appropriate Housing Management Division Director and the AssistantRegional Administrator for Housing Management (ARA for HM). (2) Upon receipt of his copy of the first copy of the first demand letterto the mortgagor, the Housing Management Division Director shall immediatelytake whatever action is deemed appropriate to obtain compliance. (3) Upon receipt of his copy of the second demand letter to the mortgagor,the Housing Management Division Director shall intensify his efforts toobtain compliance. These efforts shall include, but not necessarily belimited to, immediate notification to the mortgagor by certified mail,return receipt requested, that the interest reduction payment to the mortgageewill be subject to suspension or termination, thus rendering the mortgagorliable for the full amount of the mortgage payments, unless and until therequired page 1 of Form HUD-93104, or HUD-93104A, and any amount due, arereceived by the Multifamily Mortgage Branch, Office of Finance and Accounting,within 30 days of the date of the letter. Copies of the letter shall besent to the mortgagee; the Multifamily Mortgage Branch, Office of Financeand Accounting; the Office of Loan Management; and the ARA for HM. TheHousing Management Division Director shall continue his efforts to obtaincompliance during the 30-day period. (4) If page 1 of Form HUD-93104, or HUD-93104A, and any amount due arenot received by the Office of Finance and Accounting by the date set forthin the Housing Management Division Director's letter to the mortgagor,the Office of Finance and Accounting shall automatically suspend the interestreduction payments beginning with the next payment due to be paid. Notificationof this action, and that the mortgagor shall be liable for the full amountof the next mortgage payment falling due, shall be sent by the Office ofFinance and Accounting to the mortgagor and mortgagee by certified mail,return receipt requested, with copies to the Housing Management DivisionDirector, the ARA for HM, and the Office of Loan Management. (5) Any circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control or of an unusual orspecial nature shall be made known by the Housing Management Division Directorto the Director, Office of Loan Management, who may, if circumstances warrant,stop the automatic suspension of the interest reduction payments. The ARAfor HM shall be kept informed by copy of related correspondence. (6) If the mortgagor complies with submission requirements subsequent tothe automatic suspension, the interest reduction payments, including backpayments, shall be automatically reinstated by the Office of Finance andAccounting. Section 5. Review of Project Income and Expenses 1. <T3>Focusing the Review. </T3>Determine if the project has any specialconditions that will affect income and expense estimates. A. Access the project's physical condition. To do so, review any: (1) Recent HUD or mortgagee on-site inspection; (2) Tenant complaints on maintenance; (3) Energy Conservation Plan on file for the project; (4) Recent replacement reserve analysis or withdrawals; (5) Repair schedules required by TPAs, flexible subsidy contracts, or workoutarrangements. (Determine whether project income or other funds will payfor these repairs.) B. Review available financial information. If applicable, include any recentmonthly accounting reports (Form HUD-93479, 80, 81 or reports comparingbudgeted and actual expense) and the MIPS Financial Summary Reports; andthe servicer's and IPA's review of the most recent audited annual report.C. Review any recent GAO/IG reviews of this project or the agent's managementprocedures for this or other projects. D. Determine if the owner is requesting any change in the services or equipmentto be included in the rent. (See the Rent Schedule and cover letter transmittingowner's rent increase request.) E. Assess the impact of any procedural changes, repair schedules, escrows,or owner contributions required by any TPA, workout or flexible subsidycontract. F. <T3>Review the Field Office's files on other projects managed by the owner.</T3>Have the owner's past expense projections significantly exceeded actualexpenses later reported on the project's financial statements? Have HUD'son-site reviews, the IPA's Report on Internal Controls and Compliance,or GAO's or IG's audits detected serious weakness in cost controls or purchasingprocedures (e.g., failure to compare prices or take advantage of discounts)?Is the owner requesting a rent increase to cover expenses and physicalimprovements for which previous rental increases were authorized? If so,why? If you answered ``yes'' to any of the above questions, you shoulddetermine why those conditions exist and document this for the record.(1) If the conditions are caused by agent's practices, you must scrutinizethe budget. You may need to reduce the projections. If reduced, make appropriatenotes for the Administrative Review as to why and how you adjusted theseexpense items. (2) If past expenses were excessive and the amount will not be offset bylegitimate increases, you will need to allow even less than the prior period'sexpense. If reduced, again make notes as to why and how you adjusted theseexpense items. G. <T3>Analyze the Owner's Income and Expense Projections. </T3>Make an initialassessment during the tenant comment period. If applicable, when tenantcomments are later submitted, evaluate whether the tenant comments wouldchange your initial conclusions. (1) Compare the project's past and present project expenses. Be concernedif the owner's choice of delivery systems causes higher expenses; (i.e.,use of an identity-of-interest company or use of contract rather than projectstaff to do things that might be done by staff. Relatively high costs orrates of increase can be due to special circumstances (vandalism, largenumber of evictions, emergency repairs). It is project management's responsibilityto show that high costs are due to special circumstances rather than toinefficiency or abuse. (Regulatory agreements require that the owner providefor management which is satisfactory to HUD and ``* * * give specific answersto questions * * * relative to the income, assets, liabilities, contracts,operations, and condition of the property * * *.'')(2) <T3>Review the owner's expense projections. </T3>Enter the amount you willallow in Column I, of the Rent Increase Worksheet. Be flexible, considerthe needs of the project, tenants, the owner's return on investment andmaintaining HUD's security interest. Keep in mind that both underestimatingand overestimating expenses can have undesirable impacts. If expenses areunderestimated, deferred maintenance and defaults can result. If expensesare overestimated, the rents charged will be higher than needed which couldresult in HUD paying more subsidy than necessary. If the project chargesrents which aren't competitive in the market then vacancies result. Thiscould cause a possible default or an insurance claim. Consider utilizingexisting residual receipts to offset repairs not covered by the Reservefor Replacement or other costs that are of one time occurrence. Allow reasonableamounts for inflationary increases. But before doing so assess whetherthe actual expense base is reasonable for the level of maintenance expectedduring the next year and whether the project is taking reasonable effortsto control costs and is complying with the terms of the Certification inAppendix 3. If the prior period's actual expenses were unjustifiably excessive,adjust the prior period's actual expense before adjusting for inflation.Document this is the record. (3) <T3>Review the Income Adjustments </T3>using the guidance in the next paragraph.For each line, enter the adjustment you will allow. If your allowance significantlydiffers from the amount the owner entered, carefully documented the reasonsfor the difference. 2. <T3>Guidance for Evaluating the Appropriateness of Project Expenses.</T3>A. <T3>Administrative Expense.</T3>(1) <T3>Renting Expense. </T3>Amount allowed should be reasonably related tovacancy pattern and marketing area. Weigh impact of increased expenditureson reducing vacancy. If expense increase is due to poor marketing proceduresor appears to be a cushion, adjust down to expense of similar projects.If rental expense appears low, some upward adjustments may be made if theproject is experiencing high vacancy.(2) <T3>Salaries. </T3>To evaluate reasonableness consider:(a) Whether salary is for project employee or employee of agent. Recertificationclerk or similar clerical employees may be considered project employeeseven if work is performed in agent's office. Other project employees willnormally be located on site. Where employees working in the agent's officehave their salaries attributed in whole or in part to the project, ownermust present documentation outlining exactly how the expense was computed.(b) Number of project employees. Number of employees will depend on sizeand condition of project and whether maintenance or other services arecontracted. (c) Salary levels. Salaries should be commensurate with the size of theproject and duties required and comparable to similar positions at othersimilar projects in the same area. (d) Identity-of-interest relationships. Where such relationships existsalary levels should be closely reviewed to ensure they do not exceed ratesin arms-length relationships. (3) <T3>Office Supplies. </T3>Inflationary increases should be allowed if prioryear amount was adequate. (4) <T3>Legal. </T3>If legal expenses are significant, determine reason(s):(1) Large number of evictions; (2) above average fees to attorney (maybe caused by lack of shopping around for adequate counsel); or (3) includinglegal services that should be borne by the owner and not the project. Sincethe amount of legal fees should normally be within owner/agent's control(i.e., effective managers should screen prospective tenants and shop aroundfor reasonably priced legal services), the amount allowed should not exceedthe norm for similar projects in similar locations unless there was a problemunique to that project. (5) <T3>Auditing.</T3> Keep in mind that audit costs can vary according tothe type of project and its requirements, the size of the accounting firmand the quality of the project's records and accounting systems. (See page7-4 of Handbook 4370.4, <T3>Basic Accounting Desk Guide,</T3> for a further discussion of how auditcosts vary.) If this project's audit costs are high determine the causeof the higher costs. To do so, talk with a IPA or review prior managementor occupancy review reports and the IPA's comments on the Internal Controland Compliance Questionnaire. If costs are out of line, require futureaudits to be conducted by auditors who bid on the job. <T4>Note: </T4>Reasonable fees for preparing any Federal, state or localtax return information required of the project may be charged against theproject account and paid from project income without regard to surpluscash computations. For example, if the mortgagor entity is a partnership,the cost of preparing both the Form 1065 and the related Schedules K andK-1 may be paid from project funds. However, projects funds may not beused to pay for tax advice rendered to the mortgagor entity or its principalsor for preparation of the personal returns of the project principal.(6) <T3>Bookkeeping Fees/Accounting Services.</T3> If a computer is used, amountsallowed should be adequate to cover the cost of such services. These chargesmust be approved by HUD prior to the project paying. If identity-of-interestfirms are used, the cost paid by the project should not exceed what itwould cost to use a non-identity-of-interest firm.(7) <T3>Telephone.</T3> Allow amount for local and long distance calls relatedto project operations. Long distance calls from the project to the officeof the management agent are chargeable to the management fee not the project.(8) <T3>Miscellaneous Administrative.</T3> If the MIPS Financial Flag Reportindicates this expense category exceeds 5% of the subgroup require theowner to justify the need.B. <T3>Operating and Maintenance Expense.</T3>(1) <T3>Supplies.</T3> Check management review reports to determine if owner/agentis shopping around for lowest possible prices and is taking advantage ofquantity discounts and discounts for early payment of bills. Consider needfor supplies and owner/agent efficiency. The budget cost of one-time repairsshould be listed under project improvements. The quality of the purchasemust be considered when looking at the cost. Purchasing a superior productwith a longer life span at a higher cost might very well be more cost-effectivethen purchasing a lower quality item which does not last. Cost is not theonly thing you should consider when allowing an expense item.(2) <T3>Contracts.</T3> Consider the trade off between salary costs and contractcosts. A high level of contract repairs may indicate a need for improvedmaintenance capability, identity-of-interest relation with vendor, a one-timerehabilitation, or a cost-effective business decision.(3) <T3>Security.</T3> To determine reasonableness of expenses, the Loan Specialistsshould consider: (1) Need for expense, (i.e., is there a security problem),(2) reason for security problem, (i.e., lighting, location, layout of physicalstructure, or need for better project management); (3) extent to whichsecurity problems are within the control of the agent, (i.e., would stricterenforcement of lease provisions reduce security problem); (4) trade offbetween security services (agents) and security devices (locks, alarms,lightings, etc.); and (5) is security expense cost effective, i.e., doessecurity expense result in reduced turnover and vacancy.(4) <T3>Decorating.</T3> Determine whether new items should be budgeted forunder the Reserve for Replacement Account. Consider trade offs. Is projectusing most cost effective decorating items, i.e., would blinds be cheaperthan shades in the long run? Are additional decorative items such as drapesneeded to improve or maintain occupancy?(5) <T3>Miscellaneous Maintenance.</T3> If amount is large, identify sourceand determine need and reasonableness of expense.C. <T3>Payroll Taxes, Licenses and Insurance.</T3>(1) <T3>Payroll Taxes.</T3> Payroll taxes will generally be about 12-15 percentof project payroll costs. Included in this category are FICA, State andfederal unemployment and workers compensation. In some areas the high costsof workman's compensation can drive payroll taxes up to as high as 20 percent.In cases where this occurs, owners must document these costs. Known increasesin rates, as well as increases in salary base, will be justification forbudget increases in this expense.(2) <T3>Other Taxes.</T3> Identify source and assess reasonableness of expectedincreases and cause for increase. For example, in some states there isan intangible tax on liquid assets. The Field Office should consider assetsthat will be taxed during the upcoming year instead of accepting last year'sestimate expense. Field offices should be cognizant of the outcome of anytax appeals and adjust costs accordingly.(3) <T3>Isurance.</T3> In assessing reasonableness consider the following:(a) Types of coverage (b) deductibles and (c) claim history. Rates varyamong carriers and owners should seek the lowest rates available for equivalentcoverage.(d) <T3>Utility Expense.</T3> Only utilities paid by the project may be included.To determine reasonable consumption levels, review the justification fromowner, energy conservation survey, energy conservation plan, and otherrelated information.(1) Ensure that the owner has analyzed utility rates and requested therates most advantageous to the project. (Rates vary accordingly to consumptionlevels and types of usage_e.g., commercial or residential. Often projectscan apply for either residential or commercial rates, whichever will becheaper.)(2) If the owner has taken the action required by the preceding paragraphabove, allow rate increases which have been, or are expected to be approvedand implemented. Document the rates and effective dates used in your projections.(3) Generally, do<T3> NOT</T3> project for increased consumption. Consumption should increaseonly because of severe weather. Project for consumption levels to decreasebelow prior periods if: The prior period had severe extremes of weatherthat are not expected to occur during the period the rents will be in effect;or recent energy conservation initiatives can reasonably be expected toreduce consumption levels.(4) THIS PARAGRAPH APPLIES ONLY TO BMIR AND SECTION 236 PROJECTS, PROJECTSTHAT RECEIVE RENT SUPPLEMENT, AND PROJECTS THAT CONVERTED FROM RENT SUPPLEMENTTO SECTION 8. Section 329(C) of the 1981 HCDA requires HUD to considerwhether the mortgagor could control utility costs by securing more favorableutility rates or undertaking feasible, cost-effective actions to increaseenergy efficiency or energy consumption. Section 329(C) provides that HUDmay reduce budgeted utility expenses if the owner has not taken reasonableaction to do so. (See 4350.1, Chapter 12 for more guidance on energy conservationmeasures.)E. <T3>Property Tax. </T3>Review requirements of Chapter 5, Section 4, inHUD Handbook 4350.1. Allow only verified increases in rates. If taxes havedecreased due to changes in State or local tax laws, use effective rates.Consider also any changes in how the project is evaluated. Even if thereis a tax rate decrease, this could be offset by a change in the appraisalprocess which increased the net value of the project for tax purposes.F. <T3>Morgage Principal, Interest, MIP. </T3>Include principal, interestand any MIP (or service charge on HUD-held mortgages). Follow the instructionsin either part F(2)(a) or F(2)(b) as follows:(1) If the project will NOT be under a workout during the period coveredby the budget, use the amount required by the mortgage. If the mortgagehas been permanently modified, use the payment due under the new mortgageterms.(2) If the project will be under a workout during the period covered bythe budget, follow the instructions below.(a) Budget for any change in monthly payment that will be required duringthe year covered by the budget.(b) If the workout will require monthly payments in excess of the amountrequired by the mortgage, budget for the amount required by the workoutagreement.(c) Otherwise, budget for the amount required by the mortgage.G. <T3>Other Notes/Loan Payments.</T3> The owner's narrative must identifythe loan terms and the purpose of the loans. (For more guidance on whatloans may be charged against the project operating account, see Paragraph2-14a of Handbook 4370.1.H. <T3>Reserve for Replacement.</T3> Use amount normally requried by HUD,not a lesser amount that may have been approved as the result of a workoutagreement. Even if the owner/agent does not request any changes in reservefor replacement deposit, this may be a good time for the Loan Specialistto check the adequacy of the account and level of deposits.<T4> Note</T4>: The Field Office should consider very carefully any increasein the Reserve for Replacement requirements for projects that are eligibleor will be eligible over the next ten years to prepay their mortgages andare likely to do so. Since the reserve is an asset of the mortgagor afterrepayment, this is an especially important issue in projects where thereserve is paid or fed by deep subsidy.I. <T3>Owner Return.</T3> Projects Owned by Non-profit Mortgagors and projectsthat have converted from non-profit to limited dividend (LD) ownership,must budget only for the non-profit contingency allowed in the Rent ComputationWorksheet.(1) This policy for LDs is required by the regulations that govern transfersof ownership from non-profit to profit motivated entities (see 24 CFR 265.14(a)).While these projects may NOT budget for a distribution, if surplus cashis available 24 CFR 265.15 permits the new limited dividend owners to collecta distribution of up to 6 percent of the cash contribution THEY MADE ATTHE TIME OF THE TRANSFER.(2) <T3>For other LD projects not covered under 24 CFR 265. </T3>Distributionremains constant from year-to-year. Multiply the owner's initial equityinvestment by the rate of return HUD allows_e.g., 6 or 10 percent whicheveris appropriate.J. <T3>Project Improvement Needs.</T3> Includes: (1) Non-recurring repairexpense; (2) amounts needed to correct financial deficiencies; and (3)project improvements. Examples of eligible items include amounts neededto: (1) Restore units that have deteriorated to the point they no longercan be rented; (2) correct code violations; and (3) pay accounts payablethat affect overall viability of the project (e.g., delinquent utilitybills). Ineligible items include luxury improvements such as swimming poolsand tennis courts. While HUD does not prescribe a specific dollar amountthat may or may not be allowed, the Field Office should keep in mind thefollowing when reviewing project improvement needs requests: (1) Amountof lump sum contribution (see Item 2 below); (2) causes of problems andproposals to prevent reoccurrence (for major cost items a MIO plan is recommended);(3) management performance (check prior management review, physical inspection,audit reports); (4) impact of expenditures on rents and subsidy funds and(5) payback or potential benefits from approving the project improvements.(1) Do <T3>NOT</T3> allow for costs that will be paid from project improvementfunds (e.g., Flexible Subsidy or TPA proceeds) or reimbursed from residualreceipts or a painting, replacement, or general operating reserve.(2) Owners should: Identify the total cost and scope of work and providea written schedule for completing any capital improvements included here.List payee's name, purpose amount and date incurred for each account payableincluded. (3) Generally, allow amounts to clear accounts payable only on troubledprojects having significant operating deficits. Allow for accounts payableonly if the project's purchasing procedures are acceptable, expenses arereasonable and management is satisfactory. (4) Prorate capital improvements over an appropriate period of time. K. <T3>Lump Sum Source. </T3>Consider availability of all lump sum sources.If owner is unaware of lump sum sources, the Field Offices should advisethe owner. Listed below are some of the most used lump sum sources to fundproject improvement needs. (1) Section 241 HUD Insured Supplemental Loans or conventional financingfor capital improvements, etc. (The debt service should be shown on Section2, Line 4 of the Rental Computation Form.) (2) Owner's loan to the project. (The terms of such a loan would have tobe approved by the Field Office as repayment of the loan is to be madeout of project income as an allowable line item in the rent formula, ratherthan from surplus cash or residual receipts.) (3) Advances by the owners. (See HUD Handbook 4370.2, Chapter 2, paragraph8 for guidance.) (4) Regular Flexible Subsidy loan for troubled projects. (5) Change in ownership. (New owner equity investment can be designatedfor this purpose.) (6) Release from the residual receipts account, if applicable. Advancesfrom the replacement reserve account, provided a HUD-approved repaymentplan is included. (7) Energy grants from such sources at State, county, city agencies. (FieldOffices should attempt to keep abreast of what types of assistance areavailable in the area.) (8) Energy loans and grants from the Department of Energy. L. <T3>Assess Non-Rental Income. </T3>(1) Estimates Should be Conservative. If non-rental income is significantlyoverstated, rent potential will not be sufficient to cover project operatingcosts and owner distributions. Use previous year figures adjusted wheresolid projections are not available. (2) Includes income from all sources except: (1) Apartment rents, (2) facilitiesand services (such as furniture, air-conditioning) provided by the ownerto tenants on a voluntary basis and (3) interest earned on funds investedin replacement and residual receipts reserve accounts. To assess reasonableness,compare with income from prior years. (a) <T3>Laundry and Concession Income. </T3>Include income from laundry facilities(only if they are leased), parking space, and leased commercial space insubsidized projects only (see Section 8). Make appropriate adjustmentsfor existing commercial vacancies. (b) <T3>Investment Income </T3>1. Do <T3>NOT </T3>include security deposit interest that must be paid to tenantsor retained in the security deposit account and income that is retainedin a painting or replacement reserve or in a residual receipts account.2. If the project has large reserve balances and interest income is notshown on the HUD-92410 or the owner's budget, ask the owner why the reservesare not invested. While only some projects are required to invest replacementreserves or residual receipts, all projects are encouraged to do so. Paragraph3 of Mortgage Letter 83-24 tells you which projects must invest and howthe interest must be distributed (see Appendix <T2>XX</T2>). <T4>Note</T4>: Interest income should not be used to reduce expenses forthe purpose of granting rent increases. 3. <T3>Other Miscellaneous Income. </T3>Do NOT include: ``excess rents'' collectedfrom Section <T3>236 </T3>tenants paying above Basic rent; (exclude these amounts evenif the HUD-93104, Excess Income Report, shows the project is not requiredto submit excess income to HUD;) late charges or damage charges; (if theseare collected, they will generate distributions/residual receipts or coverunexpected costs;) generally, these amounts should be relatively small.The owner must identify the purpose of any sizable amounts. (If these amountswere not classified in accordance with IG Handbook 4372.1, require theowner to properly classify all future expenses.) M. <T3>Vacancy Loss on Apartments. </T3>Use the vacancy rate that was usedat the time of final endorsement. This will be 7 percent or 5 percent,whichever is applicable. N. <T3>Management Fees. </T3>Include only the management fee approved in theappropriate HUD-9839, i.e., the fee that is expressed as a percentage ofapartment rents/coop carrying charges collected. This applies also to thefees whose yields have been capped under paragraph 2-34, HUD Handbook 4381.5.If a fee percentage will change during the budget period, use a percentagethat represents the weighted average of the fee percentages that will bein effect during the year covered by the budget. O. <T3>General Operating Reserve (GOR). (THIS APPLIES ONLY TO COOPERATIVES.)</T3>While GOR deposits are always a percentage of the carrying charges,the percent varies between 0 and 3 percent according to the GOR balances.To determine the GOR deposit requirements for the year covered by the budget,use the carrying charge potential now in effect and the instructions inparagraph 2-12b(2)(a) of Handbook 4370.1. P. <T3>Contingency for Non-profit Owners. </T3>A 2 percent contingency reserveis required for projects owned by non-profits and those projects once ownedby non-profit but which have been sold to limited dividend partnerships.3. <T3>Quality Control. </T3>In order to encourage uniform policy, BranchChiefs/Supervisors should try as much as is possible to inform their staffsof: any proposed increases in property taxes, payroll taxes, and utilityrates; the percentage of any inflationary increases that should be allowedfor supplies, etc.; and any property tax abatements for which differenttypes of projects are eligible. When reviewing the administrative processSupervisor/Branch Chief should consider the following. A. The servicer's comments should be consistent with other information_e.g.,project conditions, recent servicing actions taken on this project, tenantcomments, the Field Office's experience with this agent? B. Are the servicer's comments dated and firmly attached to the Rent ComputationWorksheet? Do the servicer's comments: explain any significant differencesbetween the owner's and the servicer's income, expense or utility allowanceestimates? Do they adequately support the servicer's projections?C. Are all staff making the same projections as to increases in propertytaxes, utility rates, and other expenses?D. Does the servicer's decision letter identify; any physical improvementsfor which operating funds were budgeted for in the Rent Increase BudgetWorksheet; or any special conditions imposed on the owner in conjunctionwith approval of the rent increase request?E. Evaluate the rent increase's or utility allowance adjustment's impacton any tenant-based subsidy contract? Are funds available in the currentcontract? If not, has action been initiated to obtain necessary funding?Section 6. Computing Rent Potential and Utilities1. <T3>Maximum Allowable Monthly Rate Potential.</T3> To compute the maximumallowable rent potental, select the appropriate formula from Box E of RentComputation Worksheet and then complete Box F. In the case of Section 236Projects, also compute the maximum allowable market rent protential andMarket Rent Factor using Box G of the Rent Computation Worksheet. The firsttime you use the Rent Computation Worksheet for a particular project, useAppendix 4(d) to compute the monthly HUD subsidy. For subsequent rent increases,enter the monthly subsidy you computed on the prior Rent Computation Worksheet.2. <T3>New Maximum Unit Rents.</T3> (Section 236 Only.) Where a basic andmarket rent for each unit type must be computed, spread the monthly rentpotential across the different unit types. Follow the procedures in BoxH of the Rent Computation Worksheet. The Worksheet's procedures give eachunit type the same percentage increase in rent. Also, compute new maximumrents, and new maximum <T3>market</T3> rents. 3. <T3>Review the Owner/Agent Estimate of Non-Rental Income.</T3>A. <T3>Assess the reasonableness of the incomes the owner entered. </T3>Comparethem with the actual amounts shown on financial statements the projecthas previously submitted. Note that any over-estimation of these amountscould result in a rent potential insufficient to support both operatingexpense and owner distributions. Enter in the column the amounts HUD willallow. If these amounts significantly differ from the owner's estimates,document why you did not accept the owner's estimates.B. <T3>Document your reasons for approving other than the owner's estimatedexpense or income.</T3> Since the Rent Increase Worksheet does not providemuch space for comments, write any comments on a separate sheet of paper.COMMENTS MUST BE DATED, LABELED WITH THE FHA PROJECT NUMBER AND <T3>FIRMLY</T3> ATTACHED TO THE RENT COMPUTATION WORKSHEET and signed bythe Servicer and LMBC. If HUD's analysis results in a reduction of the rent level requested theowner/manager must be given an opportunity to support their request priorto HUD approving a rent level. 4. <T3>Determine the New Utility Allowance.</T3> Complete the following stepsand then the new allowances on the Rent Computation Worksheet. A. Review the owner's utility analysis and recommended allowances. (SeeSection 4, paragraph 4(A)) for a description of the information the ownermust submit.)B. Answer the following questions.(1) Are the owner's comments on recent and proposed rate increases consistentwith any information you have obtained from other projects, utility supplies,news reports?(2) Has the owner appropriately adjusted for recent and planned rate increases?(3) Has the owner appropriately adjusted consumption estimates to reflectany significant savings likely to result from recent energy conservationefforts?(4) Does the owner's sampling and analysis of tenants' actual utility costsappear reasonable?C. If the owner's analysis does not appear to support the request, discussyour concerns with the owner/agent and request additional information,if needed. KEEP IN MIND THAT BOTH UNDERESTIMATING AND OVERESTIMATING CANHAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT. D. You should usually be able to set allowances at the levels recommendedby the owner. If you approve utility allowances that deviate from thoserecommended by the owner, document your reasons for doing so. Section 7. <T3>Notification and Implementation </T3>1. <T3>Notifying the Owner.</T3> Once a decision has been reached on a rentrequest, the owner should be notified by letter. A. The letter must:(1) Explain the reasons for your decision to approve the increase or todeny all or part of the increase. The increase approved can be greaterthan what the owner requested if justified by your analysis.(2) Identify any project improvements for which funds were budgeted onthe Rent Computation Worksheet_e.g., paintg exterior of four buildingsby Spring. (3) Confirm the amount and effective date of any revised replacement reservedeposit and complete the HUD 9250. (A recorded amendment to the regulatoryagreement is not needed.) Transmit copies of the HUD 9250 to the owner,to the mortgagee and to the Management Agent.(4) Require owners to give tenants 30 days written notice of any increasein the tenant's rent under the terms of the lease. (5) Remind owners, who are subject to 24 CFR Part 245's tenant commentprocedures, to notify tenants of HUD's decision. (6) Require the owner to complete parts A and F of the Form 92548 RentalSchedule reflecting unit rents not to exceed the maximum rent potentialauthorized, and transmit the original and one copy to HUD for signature.A signed copy will be returned to the owner. B. Send the original letter to the owner and a copy to the Management Agent,unless the owner has requested a different distribution. C. If the mortgage is HUD-held and <T3>delinquent,</T3> send the following to your desk officer in the Officeof Multifamily Housing Managemnt. (1) Your decision letter;(2) Rent Schedule;(3) Rent Computation Worksheet.2. <T3>Review the Owner's Submission of the Rent Schedule (Form HUD-92458)When the Proposed Increase Won't Exceed the HUD Approved Gross Rent Potential.</T3>A. <T3>Proposed rent potential is LESS than or EQUAL</T3> to the maximum allowablepotential computed on the last Rent Computation Worksheet. The owner shouldhave completed all of the Rent Schedule, except Parts F and I.  (1) Check the accuracy of the owner's entries. Be sure: Parts D and E agreewith the assumptions you made on the Rent Computation Worksheet regardingnon-revenue producing space and commercial space. The effective date iscorrect.(2) Enter the Maximum Allowable Potential in Part F. (Obtain this amountfrom the last Rent Increase Worksheet you completed.)(3) Sign and date the Rent Schedule in Part I and distribute it as directedin paragraphs 1(B) and 1(C) of this section.3. <T3>If the Proposed Potential Exceeds the Maximum Monthly Rent Potential</T3>computed in the last Rent Increase Worksheet, complete Columns 3 through8 of Part A. If the owner will charge the maximum allowable rents, enterthe rents computed by the owner in the Rent Increase Worksheet. (<T4>Note:</T4> HUD will prepare the rents by bedroom type in the case ofSection 236.) Otherwise, enter the reduced rents you are authorizing theowner to charge. Complete Steps 1, 2 and 3 under the preceding paragraph.4. <T3>Increase Implementation.</T3> Owners may implement HUD approved changesin rents or utility allowances only after they have: complied with tenantnotice requirements; and completed any HUD-50059 or HUD-50059 Worksheetrequired by Exhibit 3-4 Handbook 4350.3, <T3>Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs.</T3>(<T4> Note:</T4> These forms are not required for Section 231 or Section202 tenants who do <T3>NOT</T3> receive tenant-based subsidies.) Owners must implement thenew utility allowances for all tenants within 75 days after HUD approvesthem. Owners may NOT stagger implementation to coincide with tenant's annualrecertifications. If a reduction in utility allowances causes the TenantRent to increase, the owner must give the tenant at least 30 days advancewritten notice of the increase.5. <T3>Notifying Tenants.</T3>A. <T3>All projects.</T3> If the rent increase or utility allowance reductionwill cause an increase in the Tenant Rent, the owner must give the tenants<T3>30 days</T3> advance written notice of the increase. The Notice mustspecify the new Tenant Rent and the date it will be effective.B. <T3>Projects subject to 24 CFR Part 245's Tenant Comment Procedures.</T3>The owner must notify tenants of the HUD Field Office decision. The owner'sNotice must be written and must:(1) Be distributed in the manner required by Section 2, paragraph 3.(2) Tell tenants what rents and utility allowances HUD has approved andany special conditions HUD imposed on the increase (e.g., completion datesfor project improvements or procedural changes required of the managementagent).(3) Tell tenants if HUD's decision will cause an increase in their rentand when that increase will be effective.6. <T3>Subsidy Contract Amendments.</T3> If a rent increase is approved, ownersmust check to be sure that subsidy contract authority is sufficient toavoid a shortfall. If a shortfall is likely, the owner should submit arequest for an amendment to the contract.Section 8. Charges for Commercial Facilities1. <T3>Determining Charges.</T3> Generally, Field Offices should require ownersto set commercial rents at least at levels that will cover the commercialspace's share of project debt service and operating expenses. (Page 1,Part C of Form 92264 shows how the gross square footage is distributedbetween residential and commercial space.)A. Field Offices may authorize project owners to set commercial rents atless than break-even levels if:1. The owner has taken or is taking all reasonable steps to lease the spaceat market rents or break-even rates and the reduced rates will not jeopardizethe financial condition of the project.2. The Field Office determines that the proposed use of the space willoffer significant benefits to the project and would be more beneficialthan other alternatives.B. Field Offices must NOT approve rents that are less than the market rentsfor comparable space unless it results in other compensatory financialbenefits for the project.C. Owners must use either the minimum rents required by paragraph 6a or6b in Part E of the rent schedule. If the owner is recommending a commercialrent that is less than the market rent for comparable space or less thanthe rent needed to cover the commercial space's share of debt service andoperating expenses, the owner must:1. Certify whether there is an identity-of-interest relationship betweenthe operating of the commercial space and the owner, the agent or any principalof either the owner or agent; and2. Attach the certification to the Rent Schedule.D. If owners lease commercial space for periods in excess of 1 years, theleases should provide for any rent increases needed to keep rents at thelevels required by this paragraph.Section 9. Charges for Facilities and Services1. <T3>Facilities and Services Subject to Charge.</T3> Owners may NOT chargeseparately tenants for equipment and services that are included in therent. Part B of the Rent Schedule lists these services and equipment.A. Owners may offer congregate services <T3>only on terms that have been approved by HUD.</T3>B.

The services, facilities and charges have been included in Part C ofthe most recently approved Rent Schedule.2. A schedule of those charges has been posted or distributed to the tenants.3. Use of those facilities or services is optional on the part of the tenant.4. If not previously authorized the charges must be approved to HUD priorto implementation.5. Owners can charge for parking <T3>only</T3> in unsubsidized projects where HUD previously approved it.The owner can charge in both subsidized and unsubsidized projects in coldclimates where parking spaces are equipped with heating units.C. All income derived from service and facility charges must be depositedin the project operating account.Section 10. Preemption of Local Rent Control1. <T3>Introduction.</T3> For those projects that are subject to State orlocal Rent Control, CFR 24 Part 246 (Local Rent Control) provides for preemptionas follows:A. <T3>Subsidized projects</T3> are preempted entirely by the regulationsin CFR 24, Part 246_Local Rent Control.B. <T3>Unsubsidized projects </T3>are preempted under the regulations whenthe Department determines that the delay or decision of the local rentcontrol Board, or other authority regulating rents pursuant to State orlocal law jeopardizes the Department's economic interest.All requests for HUD preemption of the local Board's rent controls mustbe processed in accordance with the procedures discussed in this section.2. <T3>Projects Automatically Preempted. </T3>This part applies to all projectswith mortgages insured or held by HUD that receive a subsidy in the formof:A.

Investment of Replacement Reserves and Residual Receipts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">4. Distribution of Form HUD-9807, Request for Termination of MultifamilyMortgage Insurance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Clarification of Property Insurance Requirements. </T3>24 CFR 207.260(c)requires that all projects encumbered by FHA insured mortgages must carryhazard insurance policies which meet the requirements of the Federal HousingCommissioner. Since those regulations also make mortgagees responsiblefor monitoring the adequacy of the coverage and for obtaining insurancewhen mortgagors fail to do so, several mortgage companies have asked theDepartment to clarify its insurance requirements for multifamily projects.That clarification follows.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 207.10 of the Regulations requires that multifamily projectscarry a fire and extended coverage insurance policy in an amount that meetsthe coinsurance requirements of the insurer and is at least equal to 80percent of the acutal cash value of the project's insurable improvementsand equipment. These insurance requirements apply as long as the mortgageis insured by HUD and regardless of the unpaid principal balance of themortgage. To determine the amount of insurance required at project completion,mortgagees must use the estimate of insurable value shown in Form HUD-92329,Property Insurance Schedule. In later years Form HUD-92329's insurablevalue figures must be updated to reflect changes in construction coststhat have occurred since project completion. After the first year of projectoperation, HUD will consider insurance coverage to be adequate if the insurancecoverage met the insurer's coinsurance requirements at the time the policywas issued and:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) the policy is endorsed with an agreed amount clause in which theinsurer acknowledges the adequacy of the insurance coverage and agreesnot to invoke any coinsurance penalty;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) the insurer annually certifies that the insurance coverage meetsits coinsurance requirements; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) the mortgagor/the insurance agent/the mortgagee annually correctlyrecomputes the project's insurable clause by applying cost factors publishedin one of the nationally recognized building cost indices and insurancecoverage is increased to 89% (or any higher percentage required by theinsurer's coinsurance clause) of the revised insurable value.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the mortgagor refuse to pay any higher premiums associated withrequired increases in insurance coverage, the mortgagee must pay the additionalpremiums and bill the mortgagor for those premiums.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Increase in Monthly Deposits to the Reserve for Replacements, </T3>Allprojects subject to the replacement reserve provisions of the revised Section8 New Construction or Substantial Rehabilitation regulations must increasetheir monthly deposits to the replacement reserve annually by the percentageamount of the annual adjustment approved for that project. The revisedregulations apply to all older Section 8 projects whose owners voluntarilyopted to be bound by those regulations and, except as noted below, allinsured and non-insured projects for which Agreements to Enter Into HousingAssistance Payments Contracts (AHAPs) where executed on or after November5, 1979 for New Construction projects or February 20, 1980 for SubstantialRehabilitation projects. The replacement reserve requirements of the revisedSection 8 regulations do not apply to previously HUD-owned projects soldpursuant to Section 886 (Subpart C), partially assisted projects, or Section202/8 projects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While HUD regulations do not require increases in deposits on otherprojects, regulatory agreements on insured and HUD-held projects do authorizeHUD Field staff to approve changes in the amounts of the monthly deposits.When processing rental increases, HUD staff will analyze the adequacy ofthe deposits and suggest that owners increases the deposits if the increasesare needed to meet replacement needs of the project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Whenever deposits are increased pursuant to either of the two precedingparagraphs, the Field Office will send the mortgagee fee a Form HUD-9250,Reserve for Replacements Authorization. This Form will specify the amountand effective date of the new deposit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Investment of Reserves for Replacements and Residual Receipts.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Replacement Reserves. The revised Section 8 regulations requirethat projects subject to those regulations invest the Reserve for Replacements.While HUD regulations do not mandate that other projects invest their ReplacementReserves, HUD encourages owners to do so as prudent investment can offsetinflationary increases in repair costs and enhance a project's financialcondition. If an owner elects to invest the Replacement Reserve, the Mortgagee'sCertificate (Form HUD-92434) provides that the mortgagee must permit theinvestment. Either the mortgagee or the mortgagor may effect the investment.Mortgagors subject to the revised Section 8 regulations must retain anyinvestment earnings in the Reserve.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mortgagors not subject to the revised Section 8 regulations must depositinvestment earnings in either the project's operating account for the Reservefor Replacements; the choice rests with the mortgagor. Investment earningsmay not be distributed directly to mortgagors without regard to surpluscash considerations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Residual Receipts.</T3> In the past only projects subject to SubpartF of the revised Section 8 regulations were required to invest ResidualReceipts. While the Regulatory Agreements for other projects give HUD controlover the use and investment of Residual Receipt funds, in the past HUDhas elected to allow those mortgagors to choose to invest or not to investthese funds. We are now changing our policy for these projects. Effectiveimmediately, we are requiring that all projects' Residual Receipts be investedand that any earnings on the investment be credited to the Residual Receiptsaccount. Residual Receipts may be invested only in the accounts or securitieslisted under Paragraph c below. While mortgagors relinquished control overResidual Receipts when they signed the project Regulatory Agreement, atthe present time HUD will allow the mortgagors to select among the authorizedforms of investment so long as the mortgagor exercises due care and attemptsto maximize earnings to the extent consistent with the project's liquidityneeds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Forms of Investment.</T3> Reserves for Replacement and Residual Receiptsmay be invested in Treasury securities, securities issued by a Federalagency or deposits which are insured by an agency of the Federal government.Acceptable forms of investments are listed in Paragraphs (1) through (4)below. Neither Residual Receipts nor Replacement Reserves may be investedin Repurchase Agreements (REPOS). Investments must be established so asto: (1) Permit the mortgagee to convert the investment to cash at any time;and (2) provide that the investments will at all times be under the controlof the mortgagee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Direct Obligations of the Federal Government Backed by the Full Faithand Credit of the United States.</T3> These include U.S. Treasury Bills,Notes and Bonds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Obligations of Federal Government Agencies.</T3> These include, forexample, GNMA Mortgage-Backed Securities, GNMA Participation Bonds andFarm Credit Administration issues.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Demand and Savings Deposits. Demand and savings deposits at commercialbanks, mutual savings and loan associations and credit unions are permitted,provided that the entire deposit is insured by the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF),or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporations (FSLIC).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Insured Money Market Deposit Accounts. Investment in money marketaccounts is permitted, provided that the account is insured by one of theFederal agencies identified in Subparagraph 3c(3) above.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) <T3>Choosing Among Available Forms of Investment.</T3> Except as notedbelow, the mortgagor has the right to determine which of the investmentsdiscussed in Paragraph 3c will be used and a mortgagee may not restrictthe mortgagor's choice. A mortgagor may authorize a lender to select theform of investment, if the lender is willing to accept that responsibility.If a mortgagor retains the authority to choose among authorized forms ofinvestment, the mortgagee may require the mortgagor to provide writtendirections as to the type of investment desired.
