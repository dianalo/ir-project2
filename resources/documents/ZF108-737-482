(products).andO;Product:   Uniplex 7.0 (Office automation software).andO;Topic:     Office AutomationSoftware PackagesIntegrated SoftwareEvaluation.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   User verdict. (table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lucky number sevenandM;In the beginning, there were discrete applications.andP;  Users spent a lot oftime learning different commands and converting data from one form to anotherto pass it between database, spreadsheet and word processor.andP;  A lot of timewas spent firing up one application, closing it down and starting the next.andM;Integrated software came along, but faced a fundamental problem in DOS memorylimits.andP;  Integrated applications also made most sense on a LAN, but the RAMoverhead aggravated an already desperate situation.andP;  OS/2 made promises thatit never kept.andP;  Uniplex under Unix became the leading alternative by a widemargin.andP;  Now that Unix is finding its way on to more and more PCs, it's timeto assess whether it's the ultimate office solution.andM;Uniplex is the world's leading Unix integrated office system software.andP;  ForPC fans the most important ports are SCO, Interactive and IBM's AIX, but thesoftware has been ported (in a variety of releases) to almost every box thatdisplays the ATandamp;T Unix copyright on startup.andP;  Uniplex carries the X/Openlogo, as it's an application that conforms to X/Open's standards.andM;Uniplex has had Version 7 of its integrated office automation softwareavailable on a variety of platforms since the start of the year.andP;  What makesthis review exciting is Uniplex Windows running under the PresentationManager look-alike, OSF/Motif.andP;  This X.Window-based graphical user interfacetakes a lot of the drudgery out of juggling a variety of office work.andM;The port of Uniplex 7 with Uniplex Windows OSF/Motif wasn't ready for SCOOpen Desktop (the SCO, Interactive and AIX ports will be available inshrink-wrap by the time you read this) so I reviewed the latest Uniplex on aSun SparcStation.andP;  The display was a desk-dominating 17-inch colour monitor.andO;A three-button optical mouse accompanied the Sun keyboard.andM;Sun is a staunch supporter of System V and a paid-up life member of UnixInternational.andP;  That means that the Open Look GUI is required to toe theparty line.andP;  I spent some time checking out Open Look with Uniplex forcomparison's sake, but as a PC user, the Windows 3.0 and PM-like OSF/Motifwas the easiest to pick up and use with the minimum of fuss.andP;  Most softwaredevelopers are following OSF/Motif rather than Open Look, anyway.andM;Uniplex is a big application.andP;  It's distributed on five QIC tape cartridgesin tar format.andP;  You'll need approximately 75Mb of space for installation ifyou include the language dictionaries (the European languages plus US Englishand Canadian French), but only 45Mb is required for Uniplex files once theprocess is complete, plus user files, too.andP;  Uniplex gives you a chart toestimate the growth of the program when you start filling up the system withemail and address cards and documents.andM;The hand of IXI can be seen everywhere in Uniplex 7 Windows.andP;  The package hasbeen integrated under the Cambridge X.Window X.desktop that interposes anicon between users and almost everything ugly about Unix.andM;X.desktermandM;Uniplex used another recent IXI product, X.deskterm, to pave the way fromcharacter-based Unix applications to the all-singing, all-dancing GUI worldof the X.Window system.andP;  X.deskterm sits between the application and thegraphical user environment.andP;  It provides mouse-ability with text selection,scroll bars and so on.andP;  This allowed Uniplex to take advantage of X.Windowand still have its product ready before the year 2000.andM;The effect can best be described as providing text applications withgraphical extensions.andP;  For inherently text-based applications likespreadsheets and word processing, the enhancement is welcome.andP;  If you're aseasoned Uniplex user and a GUIphobe, you can load up the old menu-styleinterface as an option.andM;The anchor of any integrated package has to be the word processor.andP;  All thetraditional editing and formatting functions are provided, but Version 7 addsa 60,000-word thesaurus with 600,000 synonyms and some DTP features like boxdrawing and font control.andM;Access to the word processing function is through a menu that includesEasiLetter and EasiMemo options for hassle-free short documents.andP;  The Uniplexediting screen is almost clean, but the function key assignments are arrayedalong the bottom as prompts.andP;  The Esc key is used to trigger command mode,and function keys resurrect menus.andM;It's not the most advanced or easy to use document editor.andP;  For instance,inserting text requires you to reformat paragraphs.andP;  Some of the commandsmake sense but they're not as intuitive as shift-arrow key combinations.andM;I'm assured by Uniplex that documents created under the new system are 100per cent compatible with older versions.andM;A tight mailmerge package is also near mandatory today.andP;  Uniplex provides onethat can address from a card file or interactively.andP;  A handy feature I wish Ihad in my current mailshot generator (Qandamp;A) is the facility to start in themiddle of the address list.andM;Only slightly less vital in a modern automated office is an email system.andO;Uniplex provides network support for NFS and RFS systems, in addition to theusual Unix-facilitated file interchange on your own host.andM;The Uniplex spreadsheet is a 1-2-3-lookalike.andP;  Where the Uniplex integrationfalls down is in comparison to software like Wingz, where the numbers and thegraphics generated are all part of the same construction.andP;  However, themultitasking ability of Unix and a nice big high-resolution screen like theSun's means that you can display your spreadsheet and the resulting graphicssimultaneously.andM;Presentation graphicsandM;Presentation graphics in Uniplex now have a third dimension and three newchart types (3D line, solid stack area and solid perspective pie).andP;  Theclip-art library has been extended and any PostScript-compatible EPSFclip-art files can be used.andP;  A drawing package, Sketchpad, is included.andM;The Uniplex database is complete with a report writer and a form composer.andO;Data Query is a non-procedural language based on ANSI standard SQL.andP;  There'sa second facet to the Uniplex database, Database Forms, that interrogates thedatabase by screen-based forms.andP;  A practice database is included fordemonstration purposes.andM;A gaggle of desktop accessories are bundled including clock, calendar,calculator and the Uniplex Decision Maker.andP;  A click on the Decision Makerwill give you a six-way coin toss spanning alternatives from definitely tonever.andM;The Notepad, Time Manager and To Do list didn't work.andP;  I got an error messagesaying Uniplex couldn't open the card file, and so on.andP;  The Names andAddresses database was bugged as well.andP;  Uniplex put these problems down tothe installation on an already brimming Sun hard disk and an allergy toOSF/Motif.andM;Like most Unix applications, there's a tremendous amount of configurationwork to be done by the systems administrator before the cogs and gears meshsmoothly.andP;  Setting up permissions, creating mailboxes and installing printersfor Uniplex isn't a trivial task.andM;There were some performance consequences to this combination, too.andP;  The SunSparcStation has about the same amount of poke as a fairly fast 386 PC.andO;Because there were lots of pixels to push around and the Unix file system tobe fed and watered, Uniplex wasn't exactly fast on its feet.andP;  Double clickingon an icon triggered a fusillade of hard disk noises and a second or so ofdelay before a new application popped up on the screen.andP;  On a couple ofoccasions I lost the cursor or a hidden portion of a window and thought thepackage had hung, but in fact it was just ruminating.andP;  I've seen the softwarerunning in a multiuser setting with excellent performance elsewhere, so Ihave to believe the explanation offered above.andM;DocumentationandM;In common with most Unix software, Uniplex comes with enough printeddocumentation to denude several acres of pine forest.andP;  There was aninstallation guide with release notes, a two-part configuration guide and anadministration guide, all in ring binders.andP;  In conventional software boxes,there were user guides for Uniplex Windows, Advanced (presentation) GraphicsSystem, Advanced Office System and Uniplex II plus (the basic package).andO;There's also a pocket-sized quick reference.andM;From the days I spent exploring Uniplex, the documents were my faithfulcompanion.andP;  The style was clear and understandable without being patronising.andO;Each section came complete with a worked example tutorial.andP;  There was ashortage of screen shots, but overall the documents were excellent, as longas you could find what you wanted.andM;ConclusionandM;Integrated office systems got a bad name at the start of the PC era.andP;  Withthe emergence of PC Unix, Uniplex can make good all those broken promises.andP;  Asuite of applications that have a common interface, use the latest graphicaltechnology, have the ability to talk to each other and allow each member ofthe office team to make their contributions is a good thing for businesscomputing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
