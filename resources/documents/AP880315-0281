Bank analysts said the move could bode a buyout or merger forDallas-based First RepublicBank, the largest bank holding companyin the Southwest and the 13th-largest in the nation.   The announcement came as Houston-based First City Bancorporationof Texas Inc. struggled against a Tuesday deadline for debt holdersto submit their securities in a rescue plan that represents thesecond-largest bank bailout in U.S. history.   The two Texas banks have been plagued by the state's economicdownturn sparked by the sharp fall in oil prices in recent yearsand its ensuing fallout on Texas' lifeblood industies of oil andreal estate.   First RepublicBank officials said they are holding preliminarydiscussions with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to restructureand recapitalize the company.   ``The decision to approach the FDIC is, in our judgment,important to providing a stable environment for FirstRepublicBank's customers,'' said Gerald W. Fronterhouse, thecompany's chairman and chief executive officer.   ``Naturally, we had hoped to work our way out of the currentdifficulties without assistance from the FDIC,'' he said.``However, we are now announcing this changed course of action tohelp clear away any concerns our customers may have.''   First RepublicBank spokesman Joseph C. Bowles said the loss ofabout $600 million in deposits over a five-day period last monthprompted the need to seek federal help.   ``Certainly two or three weeks ago we didn't believe this wouldbe necessary,'' he said.   First RepublicBank officials tried last month to combat rumorsthat the bak was considering merging with another financialinstitution, taking the unusual step of buying full-page newspaperads to assure customers their deposits were safe.   Bowles said he didn't believe the latest development would leadmore depositors to withdraw their money because ``we expect ourcustomers will understand that their money is protected.''   The bank is discussing whether to pursue open-bank assistancefrom the FDIC. Generally, that aid comes only if the FDICdetermines that keeping a bank open would be less costly to thegovernment than letting the bank fail.   An FDIC bailout of that kind would require regulators todetermine that the bank would fail without help.   But Frank Anderson, an independent bank consultant from Dallas,said, ``Most people feel like there will be a buyer.''   Sandy Flannigan, an analyst and vice president of PaineWebberInc., said the decision by First RepublicBank to seek federal aidwill renew confidence in Texas banking.   ``It should lend further stability to the banking system in thestate,'' she said. ``There has been a great deal of negative press,and the fact that they are seeking some kind of FDIC assistanceshould create some additional confidence in the system.''   Anderson said that if it takes an infusion of federal money toget the bank on its feet, ``that's the way it's going to have tobe.'</TEXT></DOC>
