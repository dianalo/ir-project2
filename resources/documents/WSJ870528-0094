StewartStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Forstmann Little andamp; Co., one of the leading firms specializing in leveraged buyouts, said it has put together a $2.7 billion leveraged buyout fund to finance future transactions.    The fund's capital includes $2 billion recently raised from institutional investors and $700 million left over from Forstmann Little's last buyout fund. The new fund is Forstmann Little's fourth such fund.    Last year Forstmann Little raised $1.4 billion and earlier this year completed a $2.1 billion leveraged buyout of Lear Siegler Inc.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Theodore J. Forstmann, general partner of Forstmann Little, said he believes the firm now &quot;has the largest amount of capital committed to leveraged buyouts&quot; and characterized the firm's success at attracting funds as a &quot;vote of confidence&quot; by the firm's investors, many of whom were investors in previous Forstmann Little funds.    Forstmann Little doesn't disclose the identities of its investors, but previously identified participants in the funds include pension funds of General Electric Co., Boeing Co., Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co., and Amoco Corp. Returns to the partners of the firm's leveraged buyout and sale last year of Dr Pepper Co. were about 8.5-to-1 over a two-year period, a return Mr. Forstmann said was &quot;on the low side&quot; of the firm's historic results.    Forstmann Little's ability to raise such a large amount of capital suggests that investor appetites for leveraged buyouts haven't been curbed by the insider-trading scandals now clouding Wall Street. Forstmann Little hasn't been touched by any of the scandals, and it doesn't rely on high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds to finance its acquisitions. </TEXT></DOC>
