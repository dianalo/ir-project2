BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In addition to the facts and figures formallyfound in a firm's annual report, Southwest Airlines Co. 1988features fun, in the form of a paper airplane.   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot ofmoney and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back tothe basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was themost basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane,'' said TimMcClure, executive creative director of Austin advertising agencyGSDandamp;M, which designed the report.   The booklet, besides reporting on Southwest's record $57.95million in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane fromthe first folding of the paper to the final painting to resembleShamu One, Southwest's ``flying whale'' jet rolled out last yearduring the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks in Texasand California.   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in Dallas willwant one?'' asked Southwest spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard. ``Or allthe CEOs?''   Besides a picture of Chairman Herb Kelleher throwing a paperairplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldoutpicture of Shamu One.   On the back page, there's the punch-out version of the unusuallypainted plane, with assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint:''   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights(Shamu One's, not his).''   Even though Southwest previously has taken a light approach toits reports, McClure said it was a little difficult this year tosell the idea of a punch-out airplane because, ``once someonepunches it out, you have an annual report with holes in the back.''   He said he persuaded Southwest that the unusual idea wouldbecome enticing. ``Everybody's going to pick it up ... and call upfor one.''   ``I think it's a delightful brochure and something that reallyshows the personality that Southwest is,'' McClure said.   Southwest, a regional airline that employs almost 6,500 people,is based at Love Field near downtown Dallas and operates adistinctive fleet of gold, rust and orange jets.</TEXT></DOC>
