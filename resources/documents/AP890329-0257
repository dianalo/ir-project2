(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wednesday itwill begin selling leading models of its computer workstationsthrough the nation's two largest industrial distributors, a movereflecting the falling prices of the machines throughout theindustry.   The company said it has signed distribution agreements withSchweber Electronics and Hall-Mark Electronics Corp. to sell somemodels of its HP 9000 Series 300, which adheres to ATandamp;T's UnixSystem V Interface Definition Issue 2.   Digital Equipment Corp. has been offering its mid-sizedworkstations through industrial distributors for some time, andHewlett-Packard's strategy represents an industry trend neededbecause prices of the computers have become dramatically cheaper inrecent years, said technology analyst Adam Cuhney at Kidder Peabodyandamp; Co.   ``It is simply not very appropriate any longer because of howaffordable these machines have become to devote the resources of adirect sales force to selling them,'' Cuhney added.   New York-based Schweber, part of the LEX Electronics Company,has 39 U.S. locations and 408 sales representatives. Hall-Mark,based in Dallas, has 35 U.S. locations and 170 salesrepresentatives.   ``Entry-level workstations have dropped to less than $5,000, somany small- and medium-sized companies now can afford workstationsfor engineering, design and commercial applications,'' said RichardC. Watts, director of marketing for HP's computer products division.   Watts said the distribution agreements will allow HP's directsales force to concentrate on Fortune 1000 companies.   The worldwide market for general purpose and technicalworkstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range in cost upto $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion and growing rapidly. Suchmachines give desktop users vastly improved abilities over standardpersonal computers, particularly in visual displays, speed andmathematical calculations.   HP has been selling workstations in Britain through industrialdistributors for the last 18 months.</TEXT></DOC>
