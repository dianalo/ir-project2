Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, released a report on the Reagan administration's strategic defense initiative. In 147 pages, the senator never said whether to deploy SDI or what to do about the Soviet radar at Krasnoyarsk or how to defend ourselves against the still-growing Soviet missile force.    Instead, the top dog of the Senate and the Democratic Party on defense matters has been devoting his attention these past months to discovering what was in the minds of the senators who voted in favor of the ABM treaty back in 1972. He's decided they had in mind the &quot;restrictive&quot; interpretation of the provisions on tests of systems based on &quot;exotic&quot; technologies, and that if the administration proceeds on the basis of the &quot;broad&quot; interpretation it will have a &quot;constitutional confrontation&quot; with the Senate.    It's bad enough that the lawyers have wrecked the criminal-justice system, the insurance system and the medical-care system. Now they are going to take over military strategy and national security policy. Sam Nunn, Emory University School of Law, 1962, will square off against the author of the broad interpretation, State Department Legal Adviser Abraham Sofaer, New York University School of Law, 1965. Predictably and perhaps inevitably, the debate between lawyers ignores the real issue at stake: Should the U.S. continue to observe a 15-year-old treaty, already riddled by Soviet violations, or move forward with deployment of a missile defense system that will scrap the balance of terror between the two superpowers?    As we distinctly remember it, the one thing that was clear in the minds of the Senate back in 1972 was that the SS-19 was a heavy missile. The late Sen. Scoop Jackson belabored this point in hearings and on the Senate floor, etching it indelibly into the record. But the Soviets blandly deployed the SS-19 despite the restrictions on heavy missiles in the &quot;interim agreement&quot; accompanying the ABM treaty. If interpretation depends on the legislative history, the treaty was dead years ago.    By now it is 1987, and the real question here is: Does the ABM treaty still have any relevance to U.S. defense policy, and does it serve our national interest to hold SDI hostage to it in the face of the Soviet buildup that took place while it was in effect? What is clear and unambiguous in the wording of the 1972 treaty is that the signatories were not carving its text into stone. Article XV specifically recognized the right of each side &quot;to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests.&quot;    If President Reagan wants his vision of a missile defense for the U.S. to survive past the inauguration of his successor, he should serve the Soviets with the required six months' notice of withdrawal. This is the only way he'll keep it out of the clutches of the lawyers and make it a matter of high policy. And if Sen. Nunn really wants to be a leader on defense matters, he'll drop the pettifoggery and let the president know he'll support a proposal to withdraw. </TEXT></DOC>
