The Commerce Department said that a decline in non-oil importsand the highest level of farm exports in almost eight years helpedto lower the deficit from the fourth quarter level of $32.02billion.   Propelled by the higher farm sales, exports jumped 5.7 percentin the first quarter to a new record of $88.50 billion.   Imports hit an all-time high as well of $116.13 billion, but the0.3 percent increase was much smaller than the pace of exportexpansion.   Friday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balanceof payments basis confirmed an improvement already noted in theCommerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports.   The totals are slightly different because the new reportexcludes military sales by the U.S. government to foreigngovernments and makes other minor adjustments to the monthlyfigures.   While the Bush administration and some analysts are looking forthe first quarter trade improvement to continue, other privateeconomists expressed fears that deficit will begin widening incoming months.   They are particularly worried about the strength in the dollar,which makes American products more expensive on overseas markets,and rising oil prices, which boost the country's foreign oil bill.   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. inLexington, Mass., predicted that the trade deficit for the entireyear will be essentially unchanged from the $127.22 billion deficitin 1988.   ``While agricultural sales were up sharply in the first quarter,that sector is really threatened by the strength in the dollarbecause there are so many other countries willing to supply theproducts if the American price becomes uncompetitive,'' she said.   But Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said he wasmore optimistic that the U.S. trade deficit would continuenarrowing this year, helped out by faster growth overseas andslower U.S. growth, which would cut the demand for imports.   ``So long as the economies of the world stay strong, there isevery reason to believe that our exports will keep doing well,'' hesaid.   The Bush administration, which has staked its economic forecaston a belief exports will keep climbing, is trying to help theprocess along with aggressive efforts to open foreign markets.   The administration on Thursday announced that it was threateningJapan, Brazil and India with special tariffs in an effort to reducebarriers blocking the sale of American products in those countries.   The big jump in exports in the first quarter reflected an 11.2percent surge in sales of American farm products, which climbed to$10.88 billion, the highest level since the second quarter of 1981.   Sales of manufactured goods and other items in the non-farmcategory were up by $3.67 billion to $77.61 billion, reflectingstrength in sales of industrial supplies, aircraft and consumergoods.   The rise in imports came entirely from an increase in petroleumimports, which shot up 17.5 percent to $10.83 billion, with theadvance coming from the higher cost of oil.   Non-petroleum imports declined by $1.23 billion to $105.30billion, reflecting a drop in demand for consumer goods and autos.   The improved trade performance put the quarterly deficit at thelowest level since a $25.7 billion imbalance in the first quarterof 1985.   The deficit with the countries of Western Europe fell to $1.02billion, the lowest level in almost six years. As usual, thelargest deficit was with Japan, an imbalance of $13.16 billion,down 14.5 percent from the fourth quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
