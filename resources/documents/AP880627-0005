The suit, filed earlier this month by a California business inU.S. District Court in Los Angeles, contends that the law has a``chilling effect'' on constitutionally protected free speech.   Another challenge was filed last Thursday in U.S. District Courtin New York on behalf of a group calling itself ``Consenting AdultsTelephone Rights Association.''   The government has agreed to give the Los Angeles court untilJuly 25 to decide whether to put the so-called ``dial-a-porn'' lawon hold pending further hearings, said Justice Department sourceswho spoke on the condition they not be identified.   Challenges to the law were expected. When President Reagansigned a massive education measure to which the dial-a-porn ban hadbeen added, he noted that ``current Supreme Court jurisprudence isunfriendly to parts of this bill.''   The law applies only to interstate dial-a-porn calls and thosein the District of Columbia, but most dial-a-porn services use a976 prefix and must be reached from a local exchange. Only inCalifornia and a few other states can they be reached long-distancewith an area code.   Barry W. Lynn, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union,says the law would apply only to about 10 percent of thedial-a-porn business. But Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., a primesponsor of the measure, says even a limited effect would spur statelegislatures to pass their own bans.   The law does not distinguish between live and recorded phonecommunications. It does not appear to apply to party-line services,Lynn said.   It provides for both criminal and civil prosecution and carriespenalties of up to $100,000 for each day of violation andimprisonment of up to six months.   Dial-a-porn is estimated to produce about $54 million a year inrevenue for providers and phone companies, according to theInformation Industry Bulletin.   The plaintiffs in both suits charge that the law would infringeon their First Amendment rights.   The Los Angeles lawsuit, filed earlier this month by SableCommunications of California Inc., claims the law is overly broadand vague, chills free speech and is not the least restrictive wayto keep children from reaching these services.   Sable Communications is an affiliate of New York-based CarlinCommunications Inc., one of the country's largest dial-a-pornproviders.   Lawrence Abelman, the attorney for Carlin whose name appears onthe suit, did not return several telephone calls for comment.   Carlin several times has challenged Federal CommunicationsCommission dial-a-porn rules requiring providers to restrict accessto children. The Sable suit notes that a federal appeals courtdecision in a Carlin challenge earlier this year ruled that thegovernment could ban ``obscene'' but not ``indecent'' telephonecommunications.   The FCC, applying a Supreme Court test, considers material to beobscene if it depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way,appealing to the prurient interest of an average person and lackingserious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.   The new law bans both obscene and indecent phone messages.   The New York suit seeks to block enforcement of the law against``live telephone conversations between consenting adults that havebeen paid for in advance by credit card,'' said Bruce J. Ennis Jr.,a Washington D.C. attorney who filed the suit.   Ennis said the plaintiffs in the action want to remain anonymousfor reasons of privacy. They are listed in the suit as ``Jane Roe,John Doe Inc. and Consenting Adults Telephone Rights Association.''   Pressure from anti-pornography groups and complaints aboutaccess by children who run up huge bills listening to pornographicmessages has been reducing the areas in which recorded dial-a-pornservices may operate.   BellSouth, the regional Bell company covering nine southeasternstates, does not allow dial-a-porn on its network, and US West hasbegun to pull the plug on these recorded messages in the 14 statesit serves.   Also, many of the pornographic services that used AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s pay-to-listen 900 lines have droppedoff since the company changed its billing system earlier this year,the company says.</TEXT></DOC>
