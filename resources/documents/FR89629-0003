Because Czechoslovakiais no longer free of CEM, we are restricting the importation of certainhorses from that country to prevent the livestock of the United Statesfrom contracting the disease.Stallions and mares over 731 days of age from Czechoslovakia are no longerallowed entry into the United States under standard 3-day quarantine andtesting procedures. Instead, these horses must be tested and treated inaccordance with procedures established to qualify stallions and mares fromCEM-affected countries for importation into the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Harvey A. Kryder, Senior StaffVeterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, Room 753,Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-7885.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The regulations on animal importations in 9 CFR Part 92 (referred to belowas the regulations) restrict the importation of horses that could introducevarious diseases, including contagious equine metritis (CEM), into theUnited States. CEM, a venereal disease, affects horses' fertility and breeding.In an interim rule effective March 24, 1989, and published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 29, 1989 (54 FR 12897-12898, DocketNumber 89-033), we amended andSection; 92.2(i)(1) of the regulations by addingCzechoslovakia to the list of countries in which CEM exists. Comments on the interim rule were required to be postmarked or receivedon or before May 30, 1989. This corrected date for receipt of commentswas published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 17, 1989 (54 FR 15302). We did not receiveany comments. The facts in the interim rule still provide a basis for therule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. Stallions and mares from Czechoslovakia that are older than 731 days mustundergo testing and treatment in Czechoslovakia and the United States thatis more extensive than is standard during a 3-day quarantine. The extratime required for this additional testing and treatment will delay thehorse importation into this country and therefore, increase the cost toimporters of horses from Czechoslovakia. However, of the approximately30,000 horses imported into the United States in 1988, only 1 came fromCzechoslovakia. We estimate the number of horses affected by this interimrule to be small. We therefore expect this rule to have little or no effecton importers. Those deterred by the cost of testing and quarantining astallion or mare affected by this rule could, instead, import geldingsor, for breeding, horses younger than 731 days. Alternatively, they couldimport horses from any CEM-free country. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>The program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
