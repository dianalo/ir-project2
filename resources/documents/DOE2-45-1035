<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-45-1035 </DOCNO><TEXT>At excitation energies in nuclei where the state density is unambiguouslydefined there is a sharp separation between the smoothed spectrum (whichdefines the density) and fluctuations about it which have recently beenstudied with a view to understanding some aspects of quantum chaos. Webriefly review these two complementary subjects, paying special attentionto: the role of the effective interaction in determining the density;the calculation of interacting-particle state and level densities, andof expectation values of interesting operators; the information aboutthe effective nucleon-nucleon interaction which is carried both by thedensity and the fluctuations. 28 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
