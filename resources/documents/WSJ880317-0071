The bank holding company, which reported a loss of $844 million last year, said it paid its two new top officers more than $1.5 million for the last half of 1987.    According to the proxy statement released late yesterday, Frank V. Cahouet, its chairman and chief executive officer, received $500,000 as a &quot;signing incentive&quot; just to join Mellon, a bonus of $150,000 and signed a five-year contract at a base salary of $600,000 a year.    Anthony P. Terracciano, president and chief operating officer, received a $300,000 signing incentive, a bonus of $101,930 and signed a three-year contract at a base salary of $465,000. Both men will also receive substantial benefits and stock options and will receive a bonus equivalent to 50% of their base pay.    Mr. Cahouet, who had previously earned $400,000 a year as president and chief operating officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association, joined Mellon last June. He succeeded J. David Barnes, who resigned under pressure after the bank posted a 1987 first-quarter loss, the first in its 118-year history.    Mellon directors selected the 55-year-old Mr. Cahouet apparently because of his success in turning around another troubled banking concern, San Francisco's Crocker National Corp., between 1984 and 1986. Soon after taking over at Mellon, Mr. Cahouet moved swiftly to cut expenses by sharply shrinking the staff to 16,000 from 19,000, restricting travel and entertainment costs and by freezing wages.    As for Mr. Barnes, he managed to negotiate a lucrative severance arrangement with his former employer. The proxy reveals that Mr. Barnes received a lump-sum severance payment in 1987 of $511,000, a salary of $154,848 and numerous benefits including financial counseling services, office space and lifetime retirement payments of more than $18,000 a month. In 1986 his salary was $511,000, and he received a bonus of $125,000 and $88,000 in profit-sharing.    How do salaries at Pittsburgh's troubled big bank compare with those at the city's profitable crosstown rival? According to PNC Financial Corp., its two top executives have comparable compensation packages to Mellon's top executives. Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC's president and chief executive, earned $792,954 last year while Chairman Roger S. Hillas earned about $556,086. Over the past three years, PNC says that Mr. O'Brien received bonuses of about $885,000 and Mr. Hillas had bonuses of about $681,000. </TEXT></DOC>
