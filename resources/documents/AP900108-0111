(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ben, one of the Kodiak bears who starred inthe ``Grizzly Adams'' television series in the late 1970s, has diedduring hibernation of chronic heart disease, zoo officials saidMonday.   The best-known resident of the Folsom Children's Zoo apparentlydied last week in his hibernation den. Zoo Director John Chapo saidMonday that Ben apparently had been dead for several days when hewas found by a zookeeper.   Ben, believed to be about 15 years old, lived at the zoo for 10years. The Kodiak bear, a subspecies of the brown bear, has a lifespan of about 35 years.   The bear's grumpy personality eventually made him unsuitable formovies and television work and his owners found a home for him inLincoln.   Kodiak bears are among the largest carnivores in North America.Ben was about 8 feet tall and weighed 800 to 1,000 pounds at death.He was somewhat smaller than the largest kodiaks, which can stand11 to 12 feet tall and weigh 1,600 pounds.   Ben usually would arouse from his hibernation on pleasant daysand eat, Chapo said, but Saturday the zookeeper could not rouse him.   Tests showed he died of chronic heart disease, Chapo said. Thecondition could have been present from birth or might havedeveloped later. It had gone undetected because physical exams ofsuch large animals are difficult and infrequent.   ``He'd always been healthy, acted fine,'' Chapo said. ``Therewas no reason'' to put him under anesthesia to examine him, whichcould be dangerous to such a big animal.</TEXT></DOC>
