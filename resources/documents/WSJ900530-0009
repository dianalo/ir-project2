Seagram is not yet &quot;beginning a national rollout&quot; of thisnew product. Mount Royal Light, which has been in two testmarkets in the Northeast since last September with somesuccess, is adding three more test markets, in Southern,Midwestern and Western states. The operative word is &quot;test&quot;and will remain so for the time being.</LP><TEXT>   You are also wrong, as is the beverage consultant TomPirko, in stating the consumer can already control the amountof alcohol in a drink by merely adding mixer or water. Thetypical serving portion of about an ounce and a half of80-proof liquor contains a half-ounce of alcohol. Thathalf-ounce of alcohol remains in the drink, whether the drinkis taken neat, on the rocks or topped off with water, soda orfruit juice. Dilution will alter the taste and make a biggerdrink, but it can't and won't reduce the quantity of alcohol(or calories either, for that matter).   By contrast, the unique process by which Mount Royal Lightis produced does reduce by one-third the amount of alcohol(and calories) in the serving, but it does not dilute thewhiskey or weaken the taste and body of the product. Youcan't do that at home.   Our extensive research indicates a strong consumerinterest in a lower-proof, thus &quot;lighter,&quot; spirits product.If Mount Royal Light continues the test well, the Nobel Prizemay well elude us, as Mr. Pirko predicts, but so farconsumers and distributors, whom you and Mr. Pirko apparentlyneglected to canvas, are telling us we have developed a verypromising product.
