If the A.C. Nielsen Co. is correct, about 2 million Americanhouseholds have simply turned off the boob tube.   Nielsen offers no explanation for this drastic and unprecedenteddecline, leading some network executives to snidely note thatperhaps the missing viewers will one day be found with all thosesocks that vanish in the dryer.   The brass at ABC, CBS and NBC say they just don't believe thatmillions of people, all of a sudden, have stopped watchingtelevision.   Turned to cable, yes. Rented a video, OK. Flipped to ``TheSimpsons'' on upstart Fox, oh, all right. But switched off the setentirely?   ``The use of the set has been a very, very predictablebehavior,'' said Alan Wurtzel, ABC's research chief. ``All of asudden, the rug has been pulled out and the behavior has beenchanged and no one can explain why.   ``Nielsen has lost people they can't account for,'' Wurtzelsaid. ``According to them, they have simply gone away.''   To realize why Nielsen's figures have turned TV land on its earis to understand how the company's rating system is the foundationupon which the television industry is built.   ``People meters'' installed in 4,000 homes across the countryprovide the ratings that help decide which shows make it and whichget yanked. But more importantly, the Nielsen numbers provide thebase for what networks charge advertisers for commercial time.   And these are the Nielsen figures for the first quarter of thisyear that have caused such a stir:   Seemingly overnight, overall television viewing is down 4percent (as compared to the same period in 1989).   And in prime-time audiences of women between the ages of 18 and49 (crucial to advertisers because this group buys most consumergoods), viewership is down nearly 10 percent.   Here is where the controversy begins. The networks say theNielsen ``people meter'' system, used nationally since 1987, isfundamentally flawed and has produced incorrect numbers.   As proof of that alleged inaccuracy, the networks point tolocalized ratings compiled during the May sweeps season, whichshowed a much lower drop-off than the national people meter survey.   ``We think all of these things are related to the peoplemeter,'' Wurtzel said. ``Every time you turn the channel, you'vegot to punch this button. We're asking people to do something thatis far beyond what is reasonable.''   Wurtzel and his counterparts at NBC and CBS blame the apparentdrop-off in viewers on ``fatigue.'' Nielsen families are just plainpooped when it comes to punching a button every time they switchthe dial, the network folks say.   Before 1987, Nielsen's national survey relied on boxes thatrequired no viewer effort. The old system told what was on thetube, but not who was watching it. The people meter is designed toshow which family member is viewing.   Nielsen stands behind its numbers, saying it has checked andrechecked the people meters and found them to be accurate.   ``There truly was a decline in the first quarter,'' said Nielsenspokeswoman Jo LaVerde. ``It is probably the largest drop we haveever seen. There has been a decline in homes using television, butwe have really not stated any conclusions on where they have gone.''   And here's where the bottom line comes in: ABC, CBS and NBC saythey cannot sell advertising for their fall schedules based onratings that are incorrect.   NBC alone has said it will lose $200 million this year inadvertising revenue, at least half of it directly caused by thedrop in Nielsen figures.   ABC added gasoline to the fire two weeks ago by announcing ithad come up with its own way of counting viewers for the purpose ofselling commercial time.   CBS and NBC followed suit by saying they, too, might revampadvertising formulas. This provides no small threat to Nielsen,which receives $20 million annually from each network, according toa Big Three executive who refused to be quoted by name.   Only Fox has said it will continue to use the traditionalstrategy of ratings guarantees during this month's ``up front''sales season.   In a nutshell, advertisers buy time on the fall schedule thismonth based on a network's guarantee to provide a certain number ofviewers. If a program draws less than the promised number, theadvertiser is given free ``make good'' time on another show.   If the Nielsen figures continue to drop, or at the very least,fluctuate widely, the Big Three stand to collectively lose hundredsof millions in advertising revenues.   Fox can afford to keep the old system. Nielsen figures show thealternative network's audience grew by 20 percent last year.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television...
