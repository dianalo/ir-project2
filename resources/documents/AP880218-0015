No pickup.^By TOM WELLS</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leftist guerrillas have struck 20 timesin the past five weeks at the lifeline of the nation's oil industry_ a 500-mile pipeline that runs through some of the most ruggedterrain in Colombia.   The attacks have raised the question of whether this SouthAmerican nation will be able to maintain its oil exports.   The National Liberation Army has blown up parts of the pipeline13 times since Jan. 12, temporarily shutting down the line andforcing Colombia to suspend its 137,000 barrels a day of oilexports.   Another seven attacks did not damage the pipeline, according tosources with Occidental Petroleum Co. who asked to remain anonymousfor security reasons.   The pipeline carries oil from the Canon Limon field in thenortheast state of Arauca to Puerto Covenas on the Caribbean coast.   The field is owned half by the state oil company Ecopetrol andhalf by Occidental and Royal Dutch Shell.   Canon Limon, discovered four years ago by Occidental, was one ofthe world's biggest oil discoveries in a decade. With a billionbarrels of reserves, it was hailed as Colombia's economic salvation.   At the time, the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN,appeared to be a ragtag band of rebels. The series of attacks hasshown that the ELN has grown considerably in strength and that thearmy is incapable of defending the pipeline.   The bombings have caused 100,000 barrels of oil to be spilled,much of it into rivers and streams.   The pipeline was put into service Dec. 7, 1986, allowingColombia to export oil for the first time since 1972.   The Canon Limon field is capable of producing 300,000 barrels ofoil a day, but Ecopetrol initially limited production to 180,000barrels a day. That limit was increased to 215,000 barrels inDecember.   An Ecopetrol source said the limit will be raised to 300,000barrels a day sometime this year. The source spoke on condition ofanonymity because all information about the pipeline is supposed tocome from the Defense Ministry, which refused to comment.   Between December 1986 and December 1987, there were about 40dynamite attacks on the pipeline. Many bombs didn't go off. The fewthat exploded did little damage, and the pipeline would be out ofservice for only a few hours.   But between Jan. 12 and Jan. 29, the ELN attacked the pipelineevery day. On Jan. 12 there were two explosions that caused a spillof 27,200 barrels of oil and forcing Ecopetrol to close down thepipeline.   The army and President Virgilio Barco said army patrols alongthe pipeline would be increased.   The line was opened again Feb. 5. Barely enough pressure hadbuilt up to begin full pumping when an attack on Feb. 9 destroyed120 feet of pipeline.   Ecopetrol was forced to close the pipeline again. It reopenedWednesday, and Colombia resumed its oil exports, according to anews release issued by the Minister of Mines, Guillermo Perry.   Crews in helicopters have little chance of spotting guerrillasin the dense jungles through which the pipe runs.   The rebels initially just tried to blow up pipe, but morerecently they have started keying on the line's big valves, whichcannot be repaired or replaced quickly.   The ELN first emerged in 1960, shortly after Fidel Castro'striumph in Cuba. It was organized by a Roman Catholic priest,Camilo Torres, who was later killed in a battle with troops in 1966.   The army estimates that the ELN has fewer than 500 combatants.There are believed to be a total of about 7,000 armed rebels inColombia's five leftist rebel groups.</TEXT></DOC>
