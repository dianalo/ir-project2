If Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher fails to meet the Mondaydeadline for protective measures, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogansaid he would grant a request of the National Wildlife Federationto order the department to enforce its suspended regulationsrequiring turtle excluder devices, TEDs, on shrimp nets.   Hogan issued those instructions in an oral ruling from the benchafter a hearing on the federation's request. Federation attorneyJan Goldman-Carter said, ``It's not entirely clear what the judgeis ordering'' but it was clear the department had to have``something in place by Monday.''   ``We intend to submit regulations for publication by next Mondaywhich would permit shrimpers to either limit their trawl times oruse TEDs,'' the department said in a statement.   ``Mosbacher's decision Monday is a true litmus test for the Bushadministration's commitment to this nation's environmental agendaand the Endangered Species Act,'' said Tom Miller, a spokesman forthe Center for Marine Conservation.   Shrimpers, contending that use of turtle excluder devicesreduces their catch by up to one-third, last month blocked shippingchannels along the Texas Gulf Coast and threatened violence againstlaw enforcement agents to protest new regulations requiring use ofthe excluder devices.   On July 24, Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the regulationsand said that after 45 days, shrimpers would be required to pull uptheir nets every 90 minutes. Experts say most turtles can survivethat long without coming up for air.   Mosbacher has since proposed regulations that would requireshrimpers to pull their nets every 105 minutes. Spokesman BrianGorman said the agency had not yet determined what interval wouldbe required in Monday's proposal.   Hogan said turtles have been left ``totally abandoned by thesecretary,'' said Hogan, who ruled that Mosbacher's decisionappears to ``fly in the face'' of a congressional mandate thatseveral species of turtle be protected by May 1.   Congress required that excluder devices be used, but gaveMosbacher authority to modify the requirement for good cause. Thefederation contends Mosbacher has not shown good cause.   Environmentalists say 11,000 turtles die each year in shrimpnets and that the excluder devices _ basically hinged boxesattached to the net _ hurt the catch only minimally.   Protecting sea turtles from shrimpers has been at issue fornearly two decades. Congress, Hogan said, acted ``after years andyears of study and thousands upon thousands upon thousands of hoursto determine the best method to preserve these species.''   And while Atlantic Coast shrimper fishermen have successfullyused the devices, Hogan said it is regrettable Texas and Louisianashrimpers ``cannot find it possible'' to use the devices even for aseason.   The Wildlife Federation argued that restricting tow times is notnearly as effective as the use of excluder devices.   While 3 percent of turtles caught will die if excluder devicesare used, raising nets after 90 minutes means a mortality rate ofat least 4.4 percent, the federation said.   Government attorney Michelle Kuruc said Mosbacher suspended theregulations after the protests because ``he felt the tempers weretoo high to propose an alternative strategy.''   ``We're not talking about rocket scientists. We're taking abouta lot of seamen who don't feel they're getting a fair shake withthese regulations,'' said Robert McManus, attorney for theConcerned Shrimpers of America.</TEXT></DOC>
