Three Israelicivilians also were killed and eight were wounded, an armycommunique said.   Israel's state-run radio said the terrorists infiltrated fromEgypt and were armed with fragmentation grenades, assault riflesand a submachine gun.   A man claiming to represent the Palestine LiberationOrganization's Force 17 phoned a Western news agency in Jerusalemand claimed responsibility for the hijacking.   Israel radio said a PLO spokesman in Tunis told CBS news thegroup was not responsible for the attack. But a survivor from thebus said she heard the Arab gunmen say they were from Fatah, thePLO faction headed by Yasser Arafat.   A special anti-terrorist unit and border police stormed the bus,which was loaded with nuclear plant workers and hijacked near theAroer junction eight miles from the Dimona nuclear facility.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir linked the attack to the riotingin the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``These are the same people who incite violence in the(occupied) territories. We shall not tire from fighting them,''said Shamir.   He noted today's attack was the second infiltration in two days.Three Palestinian guerrillas were killed by army soldiers on Sundayafter they tried to cross the Lebanon border.   Israel radio and officials said the terrorists came across thelightly guarded border from Egypt at night near Ramat Nafha andcommandeered an Israeli military automobile at about 7 a.m.   The Arab guerrillas drove the Renault-4 towards theBeersheva-Dimona highway, throwing a hand grenade at an Israelisemi-trailer but causing no injuries.   The army and witnesses said a Volvo bus with the nuclear workerswas coming from the opposite direction, and the gunmen fired at thebus and threw grenades until it stopped.   Most of the passengers and the driver escaped but a man and ninewomen remained, the radio said.   The last bus hijacking inside Israel occurred on April 12, 1984,when four bomb-weilding Palestinians hijacked an Israeli bus nearthe Mediterranean coastal city of Ashdod. A soldier was killed onthe bus when Israeli troops stormed the vehicle and captured thehijackers.   Officials at Soroka Hospital in Beersheva said eight women wereadmitted for treatment of gunshot wounds.   Police forced the bus to stop after the terrorists fired fromthe bus at passing people and cars. Police closed the area, andarmy officers entered into negotiations with terrorists.   The Arab gunmen demanded to speak with representatives of theInternational Red Cross and also asked for a loudspeaker.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of Israel's southernregion, decided to storm the bus rather than negotiate furtherafter the gunmen opened fire.   ``We made every effort to both relax them and to promise themthat negotiations may bring results,'' Mordechai told reporters atthe scene.   ``(But) they fired at us twice and afterwards they fired andkilled one of the hostages and fired at women who were inside thebus,'' he said.   In all, he said, the storming operation lasted about a minute.   Mordechai said the man was killed by Arab gunmen duringnegotiations. He said shots fired by the terrorists when the buswas stormed appeared to have killed the women.   The victims were not identified, apparently because of thesensitivity of their jobs.   At the hospital, David, a curly-haired man in his late 20s, saidhe saw armed terrorists block the blue Volvo bus, a specialcommuter vehicle carrying women workers from a plant in Dimona.   ``The terrorists blocked the bus and didn't give the driver achance to turn around and get away,'' he said. ``The driver openedthe door and many of the passengers scrambled out. About ahalf-dozen remained on the bus.''   David said the bus hijacking began about 7:30 a.m. and hewatched the hijacking from another bus. He declined to give hislast name.   Rafi Hayon, a motorist traveling the Beersheva-Dimona highway,said the Arab gunmen armed with Soviet-made automatic rifles shotat his car when he refused to stop for them.   ``I saw only two Kalashnikovs in front of my eyes,'' he said inan interview broadcast by Israel radio.   It was the bloodiest attack by Palestinian guerrillas since ahang-glider attack in late November in which a guerrilla landed innorthern Israel and shot to death six Israeli soldiers and woundedeight.   The Dimona plant is at the center of a secret trial now going onin Israel.   Mordechai Vanunu, a former nuclear technician at Dimona,revealed Israel's atomic secrets to The Sunday Times of London inan expose published Oct. 5, 1986. Based on Vanunu's information,the newspaper concluded Israel possessed the world's sixth largestnuclear arsenal.   In the Sunday Times story, Vanunu detailed the route taken by 40blue and white Volvo buses he said transported workers to thenuclear plant each day.   Vanunu, 33, was tried on charges of treason and espionage forrevealing Israel's nuclear capability and the three-judge panel inthe closed-door trial is currently deliberating its verdict.</TEXT></DOC>
