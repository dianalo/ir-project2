The plan to offer exchange-based Treasury-bond futures and options from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. EST has drawn early support from some big brokers and traders in the Treasury bond market, where world-wide volume sometimes approaches $200 billion a day.    But it's unclear that a night-time session will attract significant volume from the Far East, as it is aimed to do. The plan also raises some novel issues for exchange officials and traders, who for the first time in the U.S. will be making floor trades and, perhaps, meeting margin calls when U.S. banks and many other financial institutions are closed.    Although many regulatory and operational details aren't resolved, a members' committee of the nation's largest futures exchange has drawn up a &quot;blueprint&quot; for a night-time session to trade both Treasury-bond and Treasury-note contracts. The contracts currently are traded from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. EST.    Karsten Mahlhmann, who is currently the exchange's vice chairman and is slated to assume the chairmanship Jan. 26, says CBOT directors will likely vote on the plan later this month or in February. Evening trading could begin as early as midyear, Mr. Mahlmann says.    The CBOT is trying in part to make up lost ground in the intermarket scramble for international trading volume. Although the exchange's Treasury-bond futures market is by far the world's largest, growth in financial futures and options trading in Singapore, Tokyo and London, as well as on informal cash markets world-wide, has put increasing pressure on the exchange to continue to grow.    Unlike the archrival Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the second largest futures market, which offers linked financial-futures trading with a Singapore exchange, the CBOT doesn't have any formal overseas trading link.    Some competitors question whether a night-time trading session in the U.S. can work.    &quot;Just because you have a facility doesn't mean you'll have the liquidity&quot; to draw significant volume, says William Brodsky, president of the Merc.    The CBOT's evening session would overlap much of Tokyo's morning session, when several billion dollars of U.S. Treasury securities typically change hands. Japanese financial institutions tend to trade in tandem, heightening the need for well-capitalized market-makers in any U.S. evening session to take the opposite side of trades, says Randy Strausberg, senior vice president of Nikko Securities Co. International.    &quot;The Japanese tend to have similar philosophies,&quot; Mr. Strausberg says. &quot;You won't have Japanese institutions buying and selling at the same time.&quot;    The CBOT's idea has drawn support from U.S. trading firms. &quot;Business will go to the exchange. Chicago has proven it has a viable (bond-futures) contract,&quot; says Craig Coates, managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc., the largest primary dealer in U.S. government securities.    Tone Grant, president of Refco Group Ltd., a major futures trader, says his firm &quot;will be an active participant. We're trading 24 hours anyway.&quot;    Many of the exchange's floor traders are backing the move, according to Thomas Baldwin, one of the biggest independent traders in the CBOT's crowded Treasury-bond pit. &quot;I'll be there the first day,&quot; Mr. Baldwin says. He adds that an evening session would provide &quot;a tremendous opportunity&quot; for inexperienced traders who haven't been able to fight their way into the Treasury-bond pit during regular hours.    The CBOT still faces regulatory hurdles. Although the exchange sent a letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last November asking for permission to trade any of its contracts around the clock, the agency is awaiting a formal proposal before acting, a CFTC spokeswoman says. The CFTC typically acts on such requests within six months, she adds.    Exchange officials also are trying to iron out operational issues. Currently, trades are sorted and processed after trading ends. Although details haven't been &quot;pinned down,&quot; a second session could &quot;offer a laboratory to test out&quot; systems of matching and perhaps clearing trades continuously, says Carol Burke, CBOT vice president and special counsel. Continuous matching and clearing could sharply reduce after-hours paperwork for exchange-member firms and speed identification of trading errors and mismatches.    But ensuring that all accounts are properly margined, or guaranteed by cash or cash-equivalent deposits, could be difficult, says an executive of a member firm, who asked not to be identified.    &quot;What happens if a trader leaves here at 5 o'clock (CST) and his account is fully margined, using bonds as collateral?&quot; he asks. &quot;Then the market breaks 2 1/2 points by nine o'clock,&quot; the executive says. &quot;Are we supposed to call his bank for additional margin in the middle of the night?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
