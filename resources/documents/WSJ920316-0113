Libya was once Sudan's closest ally, supplying it withcheap oil and military equipment. But talk in Khartoum aboutsupporting the establishment of Muslim theocracies in NorthAfrica has rattled Moammar Gadhafi.</LP><TEXT>   Libyan intelligence agents visiting Sudan in Novemberdiscovered Libyan exiles planning on setting up an Islamicgovernment in Tripoli, according to a U.S. congressionalRepublican task force. Libya decided it wouldn't renew itsoil agreement with Sudan.   But that helped open the door for Iran. Tehran nowsupplies cheap oil, some Chinese-made arms and RevolutionaryGuards to help train Sudan's Popular Defense Forces, whichare becoming an Islamic alternative to Sudan's army.   The Bush administration also is concerned. Senior U.S.officials discount some recent reports about the magnitude ofIran's involvement, and they note that Sudan still is tooweak and poor to project power beyond its borders. But U.S.analysts worry that time may be on Khartoum's side.   The analysts' concern focuses on Hassan Turabi, thesophisticated, Western-educated leader of Sudan's Islamicmovement who has enormous and growing influence over theSudanese military government led by Gen. Omar Hassanal-Bashir and throughout the region.   &quot;Turabi has a larger vision that goes beyond the Sudan,&quot;says a senior U.S. official who monitors Sudan closely. &quot;He'dlike to see the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in Libya,Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and maybe even Saudi Arabia.&quot;   Sudan would provide an ideal platform from which todestabilize the region. The Nile river, which is vital tolife in Egypt, flows from Sudan, and the close cultural linksbetween the two countries make it easy for ideas to move backand forth. Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. ally in theMideast, sits just across the narrow Red Sea. And recentevents in Algeria, where fundamentalists won the first roundof free elections in December (the government canceled afollow-up vote and banned the fundamentalist party), show howsusceptible North Africa is to Mr. Turabi's vision.   Sudan's government soon might be able to focus moreresources on spreading the faith. For more than a quartercentury, various Sudanese governments have been bogged downin a civil war pitting the Muslim north against the Christiansouth. But U.S. analysts say the government recently may havegained an advantage: The major rebel force in the south hassplit into two factions, one of which may be aiding Sudan'sgovernment in its drive against the other insurgent group.The analysts say this apparent cooperation permitted thegovernment recently to capture a town that the major rebelgroup had held for years.   Sudan's abysmal human-rights record also is a source ofconcern both among its neighbors and in the West. An Arabdiplomat worries that there could be a huge spillover ofrefugees into Egypt, stretching Cairo's limited resources.   U.S. officials say that last month, Sudan drove 400,000squatters out of Khartoum and into the desert, where theylack adequate water and food. The U.S. says that at least adozen squatters were killed when they resisted eviction. TheState Department's annual human-rights report noted:&quot;Formerly uncommon in Sudan, torture and other forms ofphysical mistreatment by official and unofficial securityforces were widespread in 1991.&quot;   Against this backdrop, Iranian President Ali AkbarHashemi-Rafsanjani arrived for a state visit in Khartoum inDecember, accompanied by more than 150 senior officials. Iranagreed to supply oil to replace the former shipments fromLibya, as well as food and other economic assistance. Inaddition, according to U.S. analysts, Iran is supplyingChinese F-7 jet fighters, along with Chinese-made tanks,anti-tank missiles and armored personnel carriers. Analystssay Iranian technicians also are helping Sudan repair itsaging aircraft.   &quot;Right now, Sudan poses somewhat more than a potentialthreat but less than an imminent threat,&quot; says an Arabdiplomat. &quot;It has to be watched.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
