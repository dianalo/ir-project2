SullivanandM;Breaking away from software-only virus-protection solutions, SystemsPeripherals Inc. this month began shipping a hardware-based anti-viruspackage designed to address current and future DOS-based viruses.andM;Called Thunderbyte, the system consists of an 8-bit circuit card andvirus-detection software that rids a computer of existing viruses andprevents viruses from entering, said Arthur Greenberg, chairman of SystemsPeripherals in Peabody, Mass.andM;The circuit card is preprogrammed with a series of algorithms that look forvirus characteristics, he said.andM;Unlike virus-protection software, which is regularly updated as new virusesare discovered, Thunderbyte is designed to prevent even unknown strains fromentering the system, he said.andM;The program is transparent to the user and operates automatically withoutdegrading system performance, said Ray Wheeler, vice president of SolutionTechnologies Inc., a Thunderbyte user and reseller in Littleton, Mass.andP;  &quot;Anyattempt to load software is automatically checked for viruses.andP;  No matterwhat you load into the system, it's going to check it,&quot; he said.andM;Thunderbyte prevents unauthorized disk formatting and detects any writeoperations that bypass the operating system.andP;  Unauthorized access to harddrives is also provided.andM;Thunderbyte is now available only for DOS-based computers with an available8-or 16-bit slot.andP;  A Macintosh version is slated for release in the thirdquarter, followed by OS/2 and Unix models, according to company officials.andM;Priced at $149, Thunderbyte is supported through a 24-hour bulletin-boardservice providing details of more than 160 known viruses.andP;  The package isavailable through VARs, dealers and OEMs.andM;Systems Peripherals can be contacted at (508) 535-6196.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
