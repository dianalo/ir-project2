The decision to send Finance Minister Abel Salinas to the Berlin meeting follows a month of heated debate within the ruling American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party, or APRA, and represents an about-face for President Garcia who for the last three years has vilified the IMF as an agent of imperialism. Peru last made a payment to the IMF in 1986 and arrears to the international organization have climbed to about $700 million.    Javier Silva Ruete, a former finance minister, says senior officers at the IMF have suggested a plan that would allow Peru to obtain bridge financing from &quot;friendly&quot; governments, pay off its debts to the fund and the World Bank -- just over $1 billion in all -- and obtain fresh funds from the two agencies without necessarily having to negotiate a standby agreement. Standby agreements, in which a country agrees to make certain economic reforms, are usually required before the IMF will step in to ease the debt burden.    He says that Peru's team in Berlin this week is sounding out these possibilities with officials of the U.S., Canada, Japan and Western Europe. Members of Peru's mission to Berlin confirmed these intentions Saturday but warned against &quot;overoptimism.&quot; An IMF spokesman said in Berlin that talks were proceeding with the Peruvians but declined to say what progress, if any, had been made.    Peru urgently needs to improve its credit standing abroad to ensure even basic food and medicine imports through the end of the year. Its net international reserves are $400 million in the red, official data show, and the gold left in Central Bank vaults consists mainly of antique coins and medals, which economists here call &quot;illiquid family heirlooms.&quot;    The overtures to the IMF follow a tough economic austerity program unveiled by the government Sept. 6 after bitter debates within the ruling APRA party that almost led to President Garcia's resignation, one of his close aides says. In a four-page letter to his cabinet, this adviser says, Mr. Garcia expressed unhappiness at the severity of the adjustment measures now needed. The president reportedly blamed Peru's &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; for not cooperating with his government and offered to resign. Party associates persuaded Mr. Garcia to continue at his post, and the president has since confirmed he won't step down before his mandate ends in 1990.    But when news of his resignation offer leaked and splits in APRA were at their height last week, military coup rumors spread. &quot;The possibility of a coup was analyzed in the barracks,&quot; a leading APRA senator says, &quot;but it was discarded when it was decided that it would change nothing in the underlying economic situation.&quot; The defense minister and head of the joint chiefs of staff also ruled out a coup.    But the same sources don't deny a long list of military concerns. These include discontent with pay, worries about possible Marxist victories in the 1989 municipal and 1990 general elections, the growing threat posed by the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, uncertainty about Peru's relations with international creditors and arms suppliers, and dismay at President Garcia's political isolation.    An unpublished poll taken in Lima after the Sept. 6 economic package was announced showed that President Garcia's approval rating has plummeted to 16% from 96% in August 1985. The austerity program has doubled or tripled the prices of most basic foods. Housewives, banging saucepans in protest over shortages and high prices, marched through the streets near the presidential palace this month until they were tear-gassed and dispersed by riot police.    Peruvian officials and foreign observers note that the economic package was pushed through without consultation with the IMF. President Garcia's chief political adviser, Hugo Otero, described the package as &quot;not an IMF-style adjustment.&quot; He said the foreign exchange it aims to save &quot;is to be used to renew growth, and not to repay the foreign debt, as an IMF agreement would stipulate.&quot;    A foreign economist here says the Sept. 6 package is harsher, as well as less coherent, than an IMF-approved adjustment would have been. He calculates the measures will reduce the overall state deficit by only two percentage points to 10.5% of Peru's total output of goods and services. Without foreign funds to cushion the measures, all the remaining deficit will be financed domestically by printing money, adding to inflation that this month alone is officially forecast at more than 100%.    Richard Webb, a former Central Bank president and respected independent analyst, says he doubts Peru's efforts to improve relations with creditors will bring fresh funds, &quot;even loans to pay back interest,&quot; unless there is more currency devaluation and cutbacks in public spending. </TEXT></DOC>
