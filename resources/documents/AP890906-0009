With forceful voice and blistering rhetoric at odds with hiscongenial, pink-cheeked appearance, Candidate Gandhi denounced thosewho oppose him as relics of a feudal past, consorters with traitorsand assassins, potential instigators of religious wars.   Under Indian law, he must call elections no later than Jan. 4.   In less than five years, Gandhi has grown from political noviceto confident campaigner as he seeks to perpetuate the dynasty thatbegan in 1947 when his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, became India'sfirst prime minister as the vast Asian subcontinent was freed fromBritish colonial rule.   The Nehru-Gandhi family's domination of the prime ministershiphas been interrupted only twice _ for a total of three years. It waspersonified and perpetuated by Nehru's daughter, the iron-willedIndira Gandhi whose assassination in 1984 propelled Rajiv Gandhi, anex-airline pilot, into the leadership of the world's largest, albeitflawed and unruly, democracy.   The young man who rode to victory on a wave of sympathy for hismother's slaying is now, at the age of 45, being put to the test ofharsher political realities.   At last count, the Elections Commission was consideringapplications of 216 parties or would-be parties for places on theballot for the elections. The problem for the opposition _ and theadvantage for Gandhi _ is that the closest thing to a well-organizednational political party in India is the Congress Party he inheritedfrom his grandfather and mother.   The next best at the moment is the Janata Dal, or National Front,an ever-shifting alliance of about half a dozen parties or movementsconstantly at war within itself.   It was the Janata Dal that Gandhi assailed in 13 speeches duringa 31-hour swing in August across the southern states of Karnatakaand Andhra Pradesh.   To be sure, Gandhi has been trading barbs with Janata Dal'spresident, Viswanath Pratap Singh, his former defense and financeminister, for about three years.   But he has now launched a frontal attack on N.T. Rama Rao, JanataDal's chairman.   Rama Rao, the chief minister, or top elected official, of AndhraPradesh, is highly popular across India as a movie star who hasportrayed just about every major deity in the Hindu pantheon. He istiming the release of his next film for the election campaign.   Rama Rao, who routinely dresses in facial paint and bright orangerobes invocatory of the gods he portrays, is also the leader ofTelegu Desam, a political party operating only in Andhra Pradesh.Nevertheless, it won the second highest bloc of national Parliamentseats in the 1984 election: 30 to the Gandhi party's 415 in the544-seat chamber.   In speeches to Congress Party rallies _ officially scheduled as``public meetings'' _ in four economically depressed Andhra Pradeshtowns, Gandhi accused Rama Rao's state government of corruption,exploitation of the poor and failure to provide protection from amurky Maoist band known as Naxalites.   By the time he got to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh's state capital,Candidate Gandhi had nominally reverted to Prime Minister Gandhi.Seated beside Rama Rao at a news conference, Gandhi repeated some ofthe same charges. When a reporter tried to ask Rama Rao a question,the head of the prime minister's information office, GopalaswamiParthasarathy, stepped forward to say: ``This is not a joint pressconference.''   The next day, according to the anti-Gandhi national newspaperIndian Express, the 70ish movie star sniped at the prime minister asan ``inexperienced young brat.''   Still, a national opinion poll conducted for the news magazineIndia Today in August projected Gandhi's Congress Party would win315, or 58 percent, of the seats in the election.   Even if the opposition parties as a whole captured a majority, 58percent of the 10,399 registered voters surveyed in the poll saidthey doubted the opposition would be able to form a government. Andif they did, 69 percent thought any such government would fall apartbefore its five-year term was up.</TEXT></DOC>
