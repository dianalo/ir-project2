U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell gave independent counselLawrence E. Walsh until Friday to decide whether to proceed firstwith a trial of North on 16 charges or to try former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter on seven counts.   The judge said arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakimcould be tried individually after North and Poindexter go to trialseparately on charges they conspired to defraud the government byillegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the NicaraguanContra rebels.   Although the severance was requested by the defense, Gesell'sruling could be a boost to the prosecution's ability surmount legaldifficulties posed by the congressional immunity given three of thefour defendants.   The judge appeared to have devised a solution to the immunityproblems that he previously had said were most troublesome to him.   North, a fired National Security Council aide and a retiredMarine lieutenant colonel, Poindexter and Hakim, were grantedso-called ``use immunity'' by Congress for their testimony at theIran-Contra hearings last year. Secord testified before Congresswithout such immunity.   Under the law, Walsh cannot use the congressional testimony ofan individual defendant as evidence against that person under thelimited immunity grants.   But Gesell said ``any defendant should have considerable leewayto use indirectly ... and possibly directly immunized testimonywhile defending the charges against him.''   ``Each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimonyrevealed information which one or more of the defendants considershelpful to his own defense, if not exonerating some aspect'' of thecase, Gesell said.   ``Each defendant has contemplated using immunized testimony ofother witnesses,'' Gesell said, noting statements by Hakim andSecord that the congressional testimony of North and Poindexterwould help their cases.   Accordingly, separate trials are needed because trying thedefendants jointly would compromise each defendant's FifthAmendment right against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendmentright to challenge the testimony of a co-defendant or anotherwitness through cross-examination, the judge said.   At an earlier hearing, Gesell said he had been troubled by theconflict between these two constitutional rights that wouldinevitably occur at a joint trial of all four defendants.   Four trials also will free Walsh to use the immunized testimonyof one defendant against another. Under the ``use-immunity'' law,Poindexter's testimony, for example, may be used against North andthe other defendants but not against the former national securityadviser.   The prosecution also could use the testimony of a convicteddefendant against another defendant subsequent trials.   Walsh, who had urged a joint trial of the four defendants,declined to comment on the judge's decision, saying only that``everyone realizes that four trials are more burdensome than one,but the judge feels that that's a necessary requirement to protectthe constitutional rights of all four defendants.''   Walsh declined to say whether he would try Poindexter or Northfirst.   Gesell, meanwhile, said he had not made final decisions onwhether the congressional immunity posed such a serious problem asto preclude trying the cases at all.   But Gesell's decision to give each of the defendants' separatetrials may seriously undermine the defense argument that theimmunity problem requires dismissal of the charges altogether.   The judge said he would decide that and other major pre-trialissues by July 1 so he could set a date for a prompt trial.   The judge provisionally denied a defense motion to continue thetrials until after the November election, saying prospective jurorswould have to be questioned about whether political discussionsabout the Iran-Contra affair would undermine their impartiality.   Gesell's ruling, however, could help Secord, Hakim and North,who want to use the immunized congressional testimony as evidencethey acted under the authority of Poindexter. The former nationalsecurity adviser and retired Navy rear admiral told Congress heauthorized the diversion of arms sales profits to the Contras.   But during arguments on the issue earlier Wednesday, Walsh saidPoindexter ``knew very well he had no power'' to authorize thediversion of Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. ``Hislack of power was obvious to anyone with intelligence,'' Walsh said.   Walsh also hinted that other minor participants in theIran-Contra case still may be charged.   ``All of the peripheral figures have been carefully left out,''of the 23-count indictment returned against the four defendants inMarch, the prosecutor said. ``They will be dealt with differentlylater.'' He did not say who may be charged.   Besides the three charges involving the diversion conspiracyagainst all four defendants, Poindexter is accused in four separatecounts of obstructing congressional inquiries about the Iran-Contraaffair and making false statements to Congress.   North also is charged with lying to Congress about efforts tohelp the Contras, obstructing Attorney General Edwin Meese III'sinquiry into the Iran-Contra affair in 1986 with false statementsand destroying documents.   He also is charged with accepting an illegal gratuity byallowing Secord to install a $15,000 security fence around hishouse and obstructing an FBI investigation of who paid for it; andwith converting to his personal use $4,300 of the $90,000 intravelers checks a Contra leader gave him to cover expenses he andothers incurred to help the Nicaraguan rebels and seek release ofU.S. hostages in Lebanon.   He is also charged with conspiring with two conservativefund-raisers to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raisemoney for the non-exempt purpose of arming the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
