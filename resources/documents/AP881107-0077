The British domestic news agency said Sunday the recent discoveryof the cards counters reports of a continuing feud between the QueenMother, now aged 88, and the Windsors. It said the cards show theQueen Mother made overtures of affection to her brother-in-law andhis wife.   Edward abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee WallisWarfield Simpson, and was succeeded by his brother, King George VI,husband of the Queen Mother. George died in 1952.   The Windsors lived out their lives in France, where the duke diedin 1972 and the duchess died in 1986. Press Association's courtcorrespondent Tom Corby and photographer Ron Bell toured theWindsors' Paris mansion over the weekend.   Corby wrote that conservationists are restoring the building forMohammed Al-Fayed, to whom the city of Paris assigned the leaseafter the death of the duchess. Al-Fayed owns Harrods departmentstore in London and the Ritz Hotel in Paris.   Corby said among the memorabilia found in the mansion wereChristmas cards from members of the British royal family.   Corby said that in the 10 years or so before the duke's death,there appeared to be a reconciliation. In 1968, he said, the QueenMother, signing herself Elizabeth, sent her ``best wishes'' forChristmas ``with my love''.   He said the current British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, herhusband and other relatives also sent seasonal wishes to theWindsors.</TEXT></DOC>
