Police said at least four combatants were killed and 12 woundedin the power struggle between Christian army units and the LebaneseForces, the main Christian militia in the nearly 14-year-old civilwar against the Moslems.   Thousands of residents huddled in basements and bomb shelters asthe fighting flared into the early hours Wednesday. Others dodgedsniper fire to ring church bells in residential neighborhoods inprotest against the worsening hostilities, a police spokesman said.   Also Tuesday, moderate Shiite Moslems demonstrated in 13 villagesin south Lebanon, demanding a ban on the return of fundamentalistsupporters of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Christian army units routed Lebanese Forces militiamen from manyof their strongholds along Beirut's dividing Green Line and themountain towns of Souk el-Gharb and Bekfaya east and northeast ofBeirut, police said.   Christian militiamen responded by mounting grenade-throwingassaults on army barracks and an air base in the coastal town ofEdma, 15 miles north of Beirut, said the police spokesman.   ``It looks like a showdown. Unless it's quickly curbed it couldescalate into an all-out war,'' said the spokesman who cannot benamed under standing rergulations.   The confrontation was touched off by a firefight northeast ofBeirut at sundown Tuesday, prompting announcements by both sidesthat they have put their forces on alert.   The Lebanese Forces command accused the army of sending fivetank-led battalions of 4,000 troops rolling down on Beirut'sChristian sector from the mountains and that the 6,000-strongmilitia was ``braced for a confrontation.'' The army denied theaccusation.   The Lebanese Forces earlier said its fighters were ordered to``stand by to defend all their positions'' after a shootout with thearmy in Lebanon's central mountain range, six miles northeast ofBeirut.   The flare-up was the third between the two sides in one week,heightening the struggle for supremacy between the two most powerfulChristian fighting machines.   Police in the southern port city of Tyre said the anti-Hezbollahdemonstrations were organized by the pro-Syrian Amal militia, whosefighters evicted Hezbollah from most of the south last April.Schools, shops and businesses were closed in the 13 villages insympathy with the protest.   The biggest anti-Hezbollah march on Tuesday was in Siddiqin, sixmiles southeast of Tyre, where about 2,000 demonstrators wavedbanners saying ``No to the party of Satan, no to Iran in southLebanon.''   About 1,000 villagers in nearby Qana paraded in dusty streets,chanting ``Keep the murderers away! We don't want them back!''   The return of unarmed Hezbollahis was provided for in a peaceaccord signed by the two militias in Damascus, Syria, last month.The agreement ended a 10-month-old struggle for dominance ofLebanon's 1 million Shiites, the nation's largest sect.</TEXT></DOC>
