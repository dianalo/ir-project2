At the same time they are calling for more spending on infants,the sick and the elderly and suggest that such outlays be funded,in part, by auctioning the vast fleet of official luxury cars.   The Supreme Soviet legislature, which is grappling with thenational budget for the first time, is trying to cut an estimated$143 billion budget deficit to $95 billion at the official rate ofexchange.   The U.S. budget deficit for the year ending Sept. 30 was $152billion. The proposed Soviet deficit would be about twice as badconsidering the smaller size of the Soviet economy.   Selling off government and Communist Party automobiles wouldraise $398 million, while a 30 percent tax on tobacco and a 20percent tax on beer would provide $3.7 billion in revenue,according to a report issued Monday by Finance Minister ValentinPavlov.   Also suggested were cuts in the losses of state-ownedenterprises, and higher prices on delicacies such as crab, caviarand tongue.   Supreme Soviet committees called for $4.3 billion in newspending on pensions, medicine, orphanage food, maternity hospitalsand other social programs, Pavlov said.   The budget, originally proposed by the Kremlin and now adjustedby the legislators, retains the basic bias of previous plans.Rather than free the market to distribute scarce resources, it addsprivileged allocations for special groups from sick infants tostriking miners.   Coal miners across the country went on strike in July, returningto work only after being promised raises and a wealth of shipmentsof scarce soap, food and other items. The new budget includes $1.6billion for wage increases in the coal regions.   Other appropriations include $512 million for materialencouragement of the fish industry, $111 million for theKrasnoyarsk and Irkutsk regions of Siberia, and $398 million forraises for the police and other Interior Ministry workers.   A special appropriation of $1.4 billion for the social needs ofrailway workers apparently stems in part from fears that a railroadstrike could quickly cripple the economy. In recent weeks, variousproblems on the rail network led to a pileup of millions of tons ofcargo in ports and stations for lack of unloading.   The government is suggesting cutting oil exports by roughly 2.8percent or 3.8 million tons per day next year to ease domestic fuelshortages, according to one budget document.   The Soviet Union suffers erratic domestic gasoline shortages,and Soviet television has shown farms unable to harvest grain forlack of fuel. Officials have warned in recent weeks that continuingstrikes in the coal fields could result in power shortages in thelong Russian winter.   Budget documents also indicated that planners are running intodifficulties finding enough foreign currency to finance the grainpurchases planned for 1990.   The Soviet Union announced a drastic devaluation of the value ofthe ruble last week from $1.59 to 16 cents, but the lower rate islimited to the cash transactions of tourists and to Soviet citizenschanging money for travel abroad. The budget figures are convertedto dollars at the old rate.</TEXT></DOC>
