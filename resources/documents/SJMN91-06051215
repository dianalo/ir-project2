Women, who are notassigned combat roles under current rules, would suffer added discrimination,Pentagon officials contended.;    &quot;This legislation threatens to turn back theclock to the time when marriage and motherhood caused a discharge ordiscrimination in assignment,&quot; said Christopher Jehn, assistant secretary ofdefense for force management and personnel.;    The Defense Department saysthat as of last week, 16,337 sole-custody single parents, and 1,231 coupleswith children, were among the more than 500,000 U.S. troops deployed inOperation Desert Storm.;    Among the bills reviewed by the House ArmedServices personnel subcommittee at a hearing was a measure sponsored by Rep.Barbara Boxer, D-San Rafael, that would require the military to decide in timeof war whether to send either a mother or father of children under age 18 to acombat zone.;    Boxer's measure would allow single parents who have custodyof a minor child to stay with that child. For couples in the military who wantto stay with their children, Boxer's bill would require the Defense Departmentto decide which parent's services are more important and that one would becalled up for active duty.;    Boxer said her bill would protect Americanchildren from facing the death of one or both their parents.;    &quot;The DefenseDepartment is making every effort to keep Iraqi children from becomingorphans,&quot; she said. &quot;They ought to do something about not making Americanchildren orphans.&quot;;    Rep. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., is proposing that mothersof children under 6 months old not be assigned to an area subject to hostilefire.;    Rep. Jill Long, D-Ind., has introduced a bill that asks the militaryto consider deploying the sole, or at least one parent, to an area in whichchild care facilities are available.;    Approximately 16,300 single parentsand 1,200 couples with children are serving in the gulf.;    The images ofboth parents leaving small children for service in the war prompted theintroduction of many bills.;    But House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., saidthat &quot;it would be better to conduct discussions with the Pentagon and see ifwe can reach some kind of policy determination rather than legislation.&quot;;   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney reiterated his opposition to reversing thePentagon policy allowing the assignment of both parents of young children tothe war zone.;    &quot;What we need from a military standpoint is the ability todeploy units, and we would have to begin discriminating against people basedupon whether or not they have dependents of a certain age,&quot; Cheney said aftertestifying before another House committee.;    Earlier this month, in a letterto Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, Cheney said all members ofthe armed forces are volunteers who assume an obligation that they will be putin harm's way if called upon.;    The letter stated the department'sopposition to a non-binding Senate resolution that says the Pentagon shouldtake steps to ensure that no military couples or single parents serve in thegulf.;    Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., is proposing the resolution as an amendmentto the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act.;    &quot;It is true that we have avoluntary military on duty now in the Persian Gulf. But these are not'voluntary children,' &quot; said Boxer.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  639  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 20, 199100051215,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
