No military man had been indicted until March 1989, when amajor, a 2nd lieutenant and seven soldiers were accused of killing10 peasants in the hamlet of San Francisco in September 1988. Thatcase since has bogged down.   ``The government's near paralysis in the San Francisco killingsis merely the latest in a long line of failures to hold members ofthe armed forces accountable for political violence,'' the NewYork-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said in a report lastyear.   ``In thousands of cases, dating back to the 1980 assassinationof Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, the Salvadoran military hasrefused to assist prosecutions. In many cases senior militaryofficers have blatantly interfered with investigations orprosecutions, preventing them from being carried out,'' the reportsaid.   President Alfredo Cristiani, who announced Sunday that militarymen committed the Nov. 16 massacre of six Jesuit priests and twowomen, contends the era of impunity is over.   He did not specify who was implicated in the crime, theirnumbers or their ranks, but he announced a blue-ribbon commissionwould assist the investigation ``to deduce responsibilities andmake sure justice is done.''   He promised punishment would be meted out ``down to the lastperson implicated.''   ``El Salvador's judicial system is dangerously close tocollapse,'' said the Laywers Committee.   That appraisal is shared by U.S. authorities, includingAmbassador William Walker, who says flat out, ``The judiciary doesnot work.''   The few cases that get prosecuted are those that receive widepublicity, affect U.S. public opinion and cause a stir on CapitolHill.   ``High profile cases are prosecuted for political reasons,rather than reasons of justice,'' said a Western diplomat. ``Butthat they get prosecuted at all is progress.''   The Jesuit slayings shocked El Salvador and the world andprompted calls in the U.S. Congress for reappraisal of U.S. aid.The virtually bankrupt nation has received $4 billion in economicand military assistance from Washington during the past 10 years.   ``There are consequences of human rights violations in thefuture,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said during a visit to ElSalvador in February 1989. ``Democracy means human rights anddecency. You cannot have one without the other. Our commitment andour support are conditioned on this process and this system.''   Of the many cases unsuccessfully prosecuted, several stand out.The most glaring could be the case of Romero's assassination onMarch 24, 1980.   After a decade of political manipulation, the case is virtuallyclosed, with no one convicted or punished in connection with it.   The previous Christian Democratic administration of PresidentJose Napoleon Duarte said it knew who planned the killing and whocarried it out. It claimed the opposition-controlled legislatureimpeded prosecution to protect implicated members of the RepublicanNationalist Alliance, known as Arena, including party founderRoberto D'Aubuisson.   D'Aubuisson and Arena, which won last year's presidentialelection, deny any involvement in the archbishop's murder.   On Jan. 3, 1981, two U.S. land reform advisers and the head ofthe Salvadoran land reform insitute were murdered in the SheratonHotel. Two triggermen, both National Guard corporals, eventuallywere convicted and sentenced. But the two officers they both namedas the instigators of the crime were not convicted.   About 50 residents of the town of Armenia were massacred July30, 1981, by civil guardsmen, according to church and human rightsgroups. Whether the implicated soldiers should be covered by a 1987amnesty is still being considered by the courts, and no one hasbeen convicted in the slayings.   On Feb. 22, 1983, about 70 Indian peasants of the Las Hojasagricultural cooperative were killed by troops of the 6th militarydetachment in the western province of Sonsonate. Those implicated,including three officers, were absolved under the 1987 amnesty.   From 1984 to 1987, rights abuses steadily decreased.Humanitarian organizations were alarmed when they rose in 1988. Thesituation continued to degenerate in 1989.   The trend established in the first six months of 1989 indicatedthe number of politically motivated murders easily would surpassthose in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
