The Democratic primary _ pitting Treasurer Ann Richards,Attorney General Jim Mattox and former Gov. Mark White _ isespecially bitter. Republican hopefuls are scrambling to holdoilman Clayton Williams under the 50 percent mark he needs to avoidan April runoff election.   The races appeared headed toward an all-time state spendingrecord for a gubernatorial primary. Together, the top threeDemocrats and top four Republicans spent $25 million through March5.   A Dallas Morning News-Houston Chronicle poll conducted last weekshowed the Democrats in a dead heat and Williams widening hisalready substantial lead over the Republican pack.   The poll, to be published in the newspapers' Sunday editions,showed 28 percent of those surveyed backed Ms. Richards, whileMattox had 25 percent and White garnered 24 percent. But the poll'smargin of error of 4.5 percentage points meant it was too close tocall.   The Democratic race was so contentious that Mattox, whose ownslogan was ``Texas Tough,'' decried what he called the``cannibalism'' of his party's infighting.   Ms. Richards, a rising Democratic star after her keynote speechat the party's 1988 national convention, found herself under siegefrom opponents and the news media after repeatedly refusing to saywhether she ever used illegal drugs.   ``This question was never raised in the eight years that I wasmanaging a portfolio of $4 billion a day. It was only when I got inthe way of these two boys who want to be governor that it cameup,'' she said.   A recovering alcoholic, Ms. Richards said she hadn't used a``mood-altering chemical'' in 10 years, and she accused both Whiteand Mattox of profiteering from public service.   ``They've got the best resumes money can buy,'' Ms. Richardssaid, suggesting that besides a drug test, the candidates shouldtake lie-detector tests as well.   Mattox called on her to ``stop running the down-in-the-guttertype of campaign you're running.''   White and Mattox sparred with each other over the death penalty.   Mattox aired television commercials claiming he was responsiblefor the executions of 32 felons.   White, governor from 1983 to 1987, responded with an ad thatshowed him walking past giant photos of criminals put to deathduring his tenure, saying, ``Only a governor can make executionshappen. I did. And I will.''   The Republicans dueled more politely, with pundits predictingthat the colorful and popular ``Claytie'' will coast to victory.   ``The question is not, `Will Williams fall under 50 (percent),'but `Will he get over 60?''' said Richard Murray, director of thepoll for the newspapers by the Public Policy Center at theUniversity of Houston.   Williams' nearest rival, Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance,nonetheless predicted a runoff. A former Democrat and congressman,Hance said he would quit politics if he didn't win the GOPnomination.   Williams, a Midland businessman so popular that his campaignappearances drew autograph seekers, said he hoped to avoid a runoffso he could turn his guns on the Democrats.   ``As a Republican, it would be much better for our party if Iwere able to make it without a runoff,'' he said.   He has spent $8 million on the campaign _ $6 million out of hisown pocket _a record for one candidate in a Texas gubernatorialprimary.   The Williams campaign dominated the television airwaves withlavishly produced commercials. His final ad showed him wearing acowboy hat and standing in front of a chuck wagon, talking aboutthe spirit of Texas.   ``I'm a fourth-generation Texan and I'm very proud of it,'' hetells the camera. ``We sure as heck haven't lost that spirit.''   Besides Hance, two other GOP hopefuls aimed at a runoff.   Dallas lawyer Tom Luce, an associate of billionaire H. RossPerot, won endorsements from most of the state's largest newspapersfor offering detailed programs on such issues as education and theenvironment.   But confronted with Williams' slick TV performances, Luce saidperhaps he could have used a ``charisma transplant'' to compete.   Former Secretary of State Jack Rains was counting on a big votein his hometown of Houston to carry him after winning praise as askillful orator in three debates televised statewide.   While the governor's race monopolized the public's attention,Tuesday's primary ballots also will include dozens of other races _from the U.S. Senate to the state Legislature.   In the Senate race, Republican Phil Gramm is uncontested. On theDemocratic side, state Sen. Hugh Parmer of Fort Worth faces aLyndon LaRouche supporter, Harley Schlanger of Houston.   Secretary of State George Bayoud and the two party chairmen havepredicted that about 25 percent of the state's 8.3 millionregistered voters will cast ballots.   GOP turnout is forecast at 750,000 to 1 million, whileDemocratic turnout is estimated at 1.4 million to 1.6 million.</TEXT></DOC>
