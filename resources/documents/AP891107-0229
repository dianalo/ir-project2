(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. James Florio has served eight terms inCongress and wrote the nation's Superfund cleanup law. But he hasalways made it clear that he would happily trade the nation'sCapitol for New Jersey's Statehouse.   On his third try Tuesday, he made it. Florio, a 52-year-oldDemocrat, was elected governor, easily defeating Republican Rep.James Courter. The victory came eight years after Florio lost theclosest gubernatorial election in the state's history.   For Florio, mastering subjects such as the environment andtransportation played well to New Jersey residents, who live in apollution-riddled and traffic-clogged state.   ``I didn't pick these topics because I wanted to be governor,''Florio said. ``I've been involved in environmental legislation for20 years. I was a bird-watcher when I was a kid.''   The son of an Italian immigrant shipyard painter, Florio was bornin Brooklyn and left high school at age 17 to join the Navy. Heearned his high school equivalency diploma, and later degrees fromTrenton State College and Rutgers University Law School.   After three terms in the state Assembly, he was elected toCongress in the Democrats' 1974 ``Watergate'' freshman class. Hisdistrict takes in Camden, an aging industrial city just across theDelaware River from Philadelphia.   Florio gained statewide recognition when he ran fourth in hisparty's 1977 gubernatorial primary. He won the Democratic nominationin 1981, but lost the general election to Republican Thomas H. Keanby 1,797 votes out of nearly 2.4 million cast. Kean went on tobecome one of the most popular modern governors, but was barred bystate law from seeking a third consecutive term.   In 1981, Florio was criticized as being an icy candidate whocouldn't relate to people. He set out to change that this year, andjokingly referred to himself as ``warm and wonderful.'' He becameFlorio the people-meeter.   Friends say a big part of the transformation is attributed to ahappier personal life. But others say the ``new Florio'' persona hasbeen carefully crafted by an experienced campaign staff.   Florio ran as a loner in 1981 while separated from his firstwife. This time, he campaigned with his new wife, Lucinda, a schoolteacher. He drew approving cheers throughout the campaign bymentioning his two new grandchildren.</TEXT></DOC>
