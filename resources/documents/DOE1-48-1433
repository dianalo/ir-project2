<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-1433 </DOCNO><TEXT>At Interuniversity Reactor Institute, a fast rabbit system was installedconsisting of polyethylene tubing and a carbonfiber end point at thecore position. Carbonfiber combines a good mechanical stability underin-core conditions with a very high purity. It can be expected that asa result of the use of this material, contamination by the rabbit willbecome negligible, so that samples can be counted directly without unpacking.Results obtained with this new system are presented, and compared withresults obtained with an aluminium rabbit system used until now.
