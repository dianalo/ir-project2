U.S. District Judge Thomas S. Zilly issued a written decisioncalling the service's action arbitrary and capricious, expandingupon his ruling on Nov. 9, according to a news release issued by theSierra Club Legal Defense Club.   Zilly ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to review itsdecision and explain it within 90 days.   The ruling was a victory for environmentalists. The spotted owlis considered an indicator species, meaning it represents othercreatures that depend upon the same ecosystem. The northern spottedowl lives in the remnants of the Pacific Northwest's ancientold-growth forests.   Zilly found the Fish and Wildlife Service had no expert analysisbacking its conclusion that the owl is not endangered.   ``Rather, the expert opinion is entirely to the contrary,'' hewrote.   ``The service disregarded all the expert opinion on populationviability, including that of its own expert, that the owl is facingextinction. ... The service has failed to provide its own or otherexpert analysis supporting its conclusions,'' he said.   A spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Portland, Ore.,office could not be reached for comment.   Zilly also said the agency mischaracterized the conclusions ofMark Boyce, a timber industry consultant, when it concluded Boycedid not believe the spotted owl faced extinction.   Zilly noted Boyce wrote to the agency and said he did notconclude the owl has a low probability of extinction, and that hewould be ``very disappointed'' if efforts to preserve the owl werethwarted by a misrepresentation of his work.   More than 25 environmental groups filed the case after the Fishand Wildlife Service decided last December not to list the owl asendangered or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act.   Spotted owls have been on Washington state's endangered listsince January. About 600 pairs of the owls remain in the state, thestate Wildlife Department estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
