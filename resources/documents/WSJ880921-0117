The bill, which was passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate, also would shift to the manufacturers from the EPA some of the cost burden for banning and disposing of dangerous pesticides.    The agency has grappled for years with inadequate health and safety information for pesticides registered for use before current environmental regulations were enacted in 1984.    The bill would provide for any chemicals registered before that time to be more quickly re-registered, in part by shifting some of the re-examination cost burden to the industry. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has estimated that it would take the EPA 35 more years to register the older pesticides at the EPA's current rate of testing. The bill would set a schedule for the EPA to re-register those pesticides in nine years.    Though most environmental groups are pushing for further tightening of pesticide regulations in the next session, many lauded the House version. &quot;These amendments to the pesticide law are long overdue,&quot; said Janet Hathaway, senior project attorney for the National Resources Defense Council. &quot;You can't expect the public to have confidence in these regulations if the pesticides haven't been tested for environmental and health effects.&quot;    Current law provides for the EPA to reimburse pesticide manufacturers for disposal of any existing product, if that product is banned by the agency. In the case of dinoseb, a defoliant, the EPA estimated it would cost more than $50 million to purchase and dispose of existing supplies. The bill would move that financial burden to the manufacturer, in part by raising the re-registration fees to between $50,000 and $150,000 for each active ingredient in the product.    The Senate earlier passed a version of the bill that would also set limits for ground-water contamination by pesticides, impose health regulations for farm workers, and more closely monitor pesticide levels in foods. But the narrower House bill has a better shot at enactment in the current session, with time running out before Congress recesses Oct. 15, said members of the House Agricultural Committee. </TEXT></DOC>
