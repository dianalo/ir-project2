Tobin co-founded lessthan a year ago already is one of the 10 biggest generatorsof business -- out of 25,000 North American members -- in theFTD flower-delivery network.</LP><TEXT>   The new business lets customers use computers to orderflowers for world-wide delivery through FTD member floristshops. The rapid growth illustrates the opportunity forentrepreneurs who can develop new electronic-marketingmethods.   Mr. Tobin knew nothing about flowers when he begancontemplating his project in 1987. As the founder of severalhigh-tech companies, he thought he saw opportunity in a newservice's attempt to get people to use their personalcomputers as a window into a centralized, electronic shoppingmall. Because the new service, called Prodigy, is jointlyowned by International Business Machines Corp. and Sears,Roebuck andamp; Co., Mr. Tobin also figured it would have stayingpower. That's important because many earlier attempts at suchelectronic services had fizzled.   Mr. Tobin had not only an idea, but also an old collegeroommate, Peter H. MacMurray, who brought it to life. Mr.MacMurray, 45 years old, had recently sold a floristbusiness, and the two friends talked about what he should donext. &quot;It was sort of, do you want to buy a big sailboat, orwhat?&quot; recalls Mr. Tobin, 48. But Prodigy had caught Mr.MacMurray's eye, too. When the two talked about what theycould sell on it, Mr. MacMurray decided flowers weren't sobad after all.   In a trade where soft sentiment reigns, they focused onsoftware instead. In the business they developed, PC Flowers,nearly everything is automated.   Traditionally, of course, most FTD customers place ordersby telephone. But a PC Flowers customer uses a personalcomputer to dial into the Prodigy service, which claimsnearly 800,000 members. The customer calls up a menu of twodozen choices of floral arrangements, each accompanied by adrawing. Orders can be placed by credit card, through thestandard Prodigy arrangement. They are then automaticallydumped into the computer system of PC Flowers.   The PC Flowers computer performs a credit check. A searchbased on zip codes finds the FTD member closest to where theflowers are to be delivered. The computer then sends theorder through the sprawling FTD network to the member'sprinter, hidden perhaps somewhere behind the stash of baby'sbreath in the shop. The flowers can be delivered thatafternoon or the following morning.   Mr. Tobin says PC Flowers generated 25,000 so-called wiretransfers last year. On an average floral order of nearly$34, the originator collects a fee of 20%, or $6.80. Thus,the PC Flowers wire-transfer business produced just $170,000last year, but that was already enough to push it to the toptier of the fragmented field.   &quot;It's been a fairly quick success story,&quot; says Jim Jordan,a Florists Transworld Delivery Association, or FTD, official.   Mr. Tobin predicts that business will more than doublethis year and will reach 340,000 transfers in 1993. Thatwould make PC Flowers easily the biggest on the FTD networkand would generate more than $2.3 million in revenue.   Yet because computers do almost all the work, the companydoesn't expect to hire anyone beyond the present staff ofseven, including part-timers. The business could still be runoff the one personal computer, one printer and one answeringmachine that PC Flowers has tucked away in the back of a shopin The Plains, Va.   &quot;If you think about it, I don't have any inventory, Idon't have any payables, no collectibles and no majoroverhead,&quot; Mr. Tobin says. &quot;That's been my dream for 20years, to find a business like this.&quot;   With the basic idea in hand, PC Flowers is already lookingfor ways to expand it. Mr. Jordan of FTD says the group islooking into delivering merchandise other than flowers, suchas fruit and cookies or baskets of things for new mothers.Mr. Tobin says he also has investigated other possibilitieswith FTD, such as electronic peripherals for computers. &quot;Inow have the biggest distribution network in front of me,&quot;Mr. Tobin says. &quot;I can deliver within a day in 160countries.&quot;   Those other products may require more diversification thanmany florists want. But, in the meantime, PC Flowers istesting links with hotels. In five hotels, touchscreens inrooms that let people browse through a limited catalog ofitems include entries from PC Flowers. Someone placing anorder must dial a toll-free number, and an operator must takethe order -- a more cumbersome procedure for the company. ButMr. Tobin is intrigued by the market of 700,000 hotel roomsaround the U.S.   The entrepreneur acknowledges that PC Flowers has yet tomake money and that plenty of thorny problems developedduring the start-up phase. He says it was &quot;incrediblycomplicated&quot; to get the software to translate orders fromProdigy's format into FTD's. Prodigy also had to change itssoftware to let PC Flowers collect orders every two or threehours, instead of daily as most member stores did.   Mr. Tobin and Mr. MacMurray had to buy and operate aflorist shop to qualify as an FTD member. Both FTD andProdigy took some convincing, too, about the business'scredentials.   PC Flowers still has some rough edges. For instance,anyone ordering after 10:30 a.m. can't get the same-daydelivery that other FTD customers sometimes enjoy after thathour. (The partners are trying to make their service moretimely.) Moreover, Prodigy can't yet easily handle Canadianzip codes. And Prodigy graphics still resemble stick figuresmore than photos.   There's also still the possibility that Prodigy will fallon its face. Mr. Tobin's growth assumptions require thatProdigy's membership rolls soar to between three million andfour million members in 1993, from nearly 800,000 now. Yetfew market researchers are so optimistic.   In addition, Prodigy's start-up expenses are headingtoward $1 billion, at a time when Sears's prospects arestagnating and IBM is keeping a close eye on budgets.Therefore, it's conceivable that even those two giants couldsome day pull the plug on the whole service, some industryexecutives believe.   &quot;If Prodigy falls on its behind, we're in trouble,&quot; Mr.Tobin says. &quot;But I think they have enough momentum going.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
