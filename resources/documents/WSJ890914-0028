State and federal regulators step up surveillance, but critics point out the large universe of unlisted stocks offers plenty of shadowy corners for hiding. A recent report indicated the number of completed state probes jumped by 51% from 1987 to 1988. &quot;The penny stock investigation might have to be done all over again in a couple of years unless it's followed up with more money and more people keeping a constant vigil,&quot; says Lipper's Perrin Long.    Meanwhile, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the industry watchdog, considers initiating collection procedures for fines it levies against miscreants who simply walk away from the business. To help investors, the NASD carries data on 450,000 broker-dealers and salespeople, answering written inquiries about any disciplinary actions. So far, the NASD inquiry service has 10,000 requests. Investors get two inquiries hits per quarter; others cost $20. And, most state regulators will provide a broker's disciplinary history on the phone.    Several states consider going after top salespeople as well as principals to stamp out &quot;boiler rooms.&quot;    GRIDIRON GATE: Cardinals' ticket prices are clipped; others keep running.    The Phoenix Cardinals nearly double the number of cheap ($15) seats to 6,500. The move effectively trims the average ticket price to $36 from $38. &quot;People had the misconception you couldn't buy a ticket for our games,&quot; says a spokesman. This year, Phoenix sells about 40,000 season tickets, down from about 55,000 in 1988. But the New England Patriots (under new owner and Remington chief Victor Kiam) raise the tariff. Choice 50-yard-line seats jump 30% to $43; the cheapest tickets rise about 20%.    Why are prices climbing? &quot;It sure wasn't because we won a lot of games,&quot; admits Jack Ragsdale, head of ticket sales for the Atlanta Falcons. About 85% of the seats in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium sell for $20, up from $17 last year. And the Jets and the Giants still charge New York prices even though they play in New Jersey these days. Both teams up prices by a couple of dollars to the mid-20s. The Los Angeles Raiders hike the tab on the most costly seats to $30 from $28.    Most stadiums curb beer sales and the brew is banned altogether at Giants, Jets and Buffalo Bills night games.    MONEY CAN'T BUY the kind of credibility these &quot;news&quot; services provide.    Quaker's Gatorade has its Sports Science Institute, Reebok its Aerobic Information Bureau and Nutri/System operates the Health and Fitness Information Bureau. The &quot;marrying of a company's interest and consumers' interest&quot; isn't new, but it's on the rise, says John Paluszek, head of the Public Relations Society of America. The popularity of bite-size newspaper items fuels demand. Mr. Paluszek says the credibility gained by having a firm's material judged newsworthy by a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; editor is &quot;very valuable.&quot;    Cereal-makers are among the most prolific practitioners of ersatz news. Health-care firms aren't far behind. Last year Kellogg launched &quot;Project Nutrition,&quot; which featured a cholesterol-lowering contest; this summer an offshoot program promotes &quot;healthy hearts&quot; among children. The Chlor-Trimeton Allergy Season Index has been measuring pollen counts since 1984.    The Reebok items -- snippets on fast-walking and the like -- reap 130 to 150 news clippings a month.    DEAR CHAIRMAN: Only half the individual investors polled by Hill andamp; Knowlton read the management discussion part of their annual reports.    TWO LEATHER DRESSES or 250 pairs of socks can be bought for $1,250 -- the average amount spent on clothes last year, according to a R.H. Bruskin Associates survey of adults earning $40,000 and more.    FINALLY, A USE for Susan B. Anthony dollars: a New York-to-New Jersey subway accepts the coins at a few turnstiles and issues them as change for $5.    SMALLER &quot;WASHLOADS&quot; are target of rules to thwart money launderers.    Starting tomorrow, the Treasury can zero in on a specific geographic area and require that every bank and financial institution report all cash transactions. The new rule, tied to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, takes the pursuit of money launderers into personal and small business banking. Targeted amounts (theoretically from $1 on up) and areas (a state, county, city or few blocks) are up to the government. Now, banks are required to report cash transactions of $10,000 or more.    Banks, which originally opposed the rule, ask that the Treasury review its usefulness after a year, says John Byrne, counsel for the American Bankers group. The sweeps could cover small dealings, like buying traveler's checks for the family vacation, to large cash dealings by high-turnover firms that are now exempt, like retailers and fast-food chains. Another proposal: A log of each time a customer buys traveler's checks or the like for as little as $3,000.    &quot;Targeting could potentially be the most dramatic change&quot; for banks in tracking launderers, says Mr. Byrne.    BRIEFS: Anti-takeover laws now exist in 39 states, creating a de facto national policy, says a book from the Investor Responsibility Research Center. . . . The U.S. ranks worst in a Gallup spelling survey testing adults in four English-speaking countries, says Franklin Computer, which makes electronic language and spelling aids. </TEXT></DOC>
