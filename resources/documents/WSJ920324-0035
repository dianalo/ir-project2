I wish to address somepoints the article raised.   You wrote that the U.S. deported John Demjanjuk to Israel.Pursuant to a formal Israeli request, the U.S. extradited himto Israel; he was not deported. Although an order ofdeportation had been entered against him, with the SovietUnion designated as the country to which he was to be sent,the decision whether to proceed with extradition ordeportation was left to the U.S. government.</LP><TEXT>   The difference is significant. Whereas deportationinvolves expelling an alien to any country that will accepthim, extradition involves one nation surrendering to another&quot;an individual accused or convicted of an offense outside ofits {i.e. the first nation's} own territory, and within theterritorial jurisdiction of the other, which, being competentto try and punish him, demands the surrender.&quot;   America's extradition necessarily entailed our recognitionof Israeli jurisdiction to try Demjanjuk for crimes thatoccurred in Nazi-occupied Poland prior to the existence ofIsrael. This would not have been the situation had he beendeported. Such recognition, standing in marked contrast tothe many voices in 1961 that questioned the right of Israelto try Adolf Eichmann for his role in carrying out the Nazicrimes against the Jews, reflects society's evolvingawareness about the Holocaust and its significance.   You point out that Mr. Buchanan seems to question whetherthe Nazis murdered 850,000 Jews at Treblinka (the Israelishaving convicted Demjanjuk for his role in having been anoperator of its gas chambers). At the Demjanjukdenaturalization trial, the government expert, Dr. WolfgangScheffler of the Free University of Berlin, testified to thekilling of 900,000 Jews at Treblinka.   Lee A.
