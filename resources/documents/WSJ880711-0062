The Texas billionaire with the Texas-size reputation for battling bureaucracy launched a new company to save the U.S. Postal Service and to make himself another fortune in the process.    But for now, anyway, Mr. Perot has been shot out of the saddle. The Postal Service Friday suspended its no-bid contract with Perot Systems Corp. in response to pressure from Capitol Hill and government watchdog agencies. &quot;I can't spend 100% of my effort fighting for this contract and trying to hold off the world's largest corporation,&quot; Postmaster General Anthony Frank said last week as criticism of the deal mounted.    The largest corporation is General Motors Corp., which Messrs. Perot and Frank blame for all the flak. The auto maker weathered a stormy parting with Mr. Perot in December 1986, two years after buying his first company, Electronic Data Systems Corp. GM orchestrated opposition to the postal pact, say Messrs. Perot and Frank, to head off competition for EDS in the government computer-systems business. GM rejects that charge.    One thing is clear: Mr. Frank and Mr. Perot brought trouble enough on themselves. Postal Service documents show that Mr. Frank, fresh from the private sector, was warned early by senior aides that taking shortcuts around contract regulations, even to slash red-tape, would raise a stink in Washington.    As for Mr. Perot, other documents show that he wanted fully half of any savings he would generate for the Postal Service. He didn't get that much, but the deal was good enough to open him to charges of being more interested in profits than public service.    &quot;It's a big mess,&quot; says a congressional aide involved in the matter.    Concedes Mr. Frank: &quot;You live and learn. Something that's a great deal in the private sector isn't necessarily so in the public sector, where we are.&quot;    The situation seems to be a textbook case of how a former businessman can stub his toe in government. For Mr. Perot, it marks the second time that his crusade against bureaucracy has hit a brick wall. The first was with GM, where Mr. Perot's public criticism of entrenched bureaucracy failed to sway management and finally led the GM board to engineer his ouster in a $750 million buy-out.    Mr. Frank says he contacted Mr. Perot soon after he was named to run the Postal Service in February. He had Mr. Perot meet with the service's board of governors at dinner March 7. The goal: a contract in which Mr. Perot would find ways for the Postal Service to save money and then take some of the savings as his profit.    But despite the Reagan administration's rhetoric about &quot;privatization&quot; of government services, problems loomed. In a March 28 memo, for example, senior Postal Service officials said an advantage of hiring Mr. Perot was his &quot;image, in part, as a public benefactor.&quot; But the same memo warned of &quot;the appearance of a predisposition to contract&quot; with Mr. Perot's firm and the possibility that potential competitors would object.    Talks proceeded over the next three months. Mr. Perot held out for a 50% cut of any savings achieved by his company's work, says a summary of the negotiations prepared by a Postal Service contracting official. But Postal Service negotiators protested that splitting savings 50-50, as Mr. Perot proposed, would result in &quot;inordinate&quot; profits to Perot Systems, according to the summary.    On May 26, the two sides tentatively agreed to a compromise: Perot Systems would receive 50% of any savings, but the company's profits would be capped at 10% over its costs, after taxes. Even that, though, gave the negotiators cold feet. Ultimately, Mr. Frank says, the two sides agreed to negotiate fees on a project-by-project basis, taking into consideration the agency's own contributions to any savings achieved. &quot;We aren't fools,&quot; Mr. Frank says.    Mr. Perot adds that he wouldn't &quot;embarrass myself or the postal service&quot; by reaping &quot;extreme&quot; profits.    As the agreement was finally drafted, Mr. Perot's company agreed to look for ways to save the Postal Service money through new automation, computer systems overhaul, or restructuring of work procedures. Labor costs, which make up more than 80% of the total budget, weren't included.    After a 90-day study budgeted for up to $500,000, Perot Systems would work on a non-profit basis until December 1989, in keeping with non-competition agreements Mr. Perot and GM negotiated in 1986.    The Postal Service also agreed to something else: during the first five years of the contract, it wouldn't hire anyone else to work on cost-cutting projects proposed by Perot Systems unless the company agreed.    On June 2, Messrs. Frank and Perot unveiled their deal with much ado at a Washington news conference. Perot Systems, Mr. Perot declared, would partly be owned by a family partnership entitled HWGA, for Here We Go Again. The contract grabbed instant attention; it put Mr. Perot on the cover of U.S. News and World Report, which said the entrepreneur was &quot;taking on what may well be the biggest fight of his life.&quot;    Instead of fighting to cut postal costs, however, Mr. Perot wound up fighting his old company, EDS. The Dallas-based concern was one of several that protested the no-bid contract, claiming that it &quot;improperly allowed {Perot Systems Corp.}, a private entity, to control Postal Service policy and management decisions. . . for at least five years.&quot; It was, EDS claimed, an &quot;illegal restriction&quot; on the Postal Service.    Mr. Perot says he found EDS's outrage surprising. &quot;EDS has a number of sole source contracts,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn't hear them say, 'We can't take these, this isn't the right thing to do.'&quot;    But the new contract's timing couldn't have been worse. Two weeks after it was announced, the Pentagon contracting scandal erupted. Suddenly, no-bid, sole-source contracts became symbols of cronyism. Congressional critics such as Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) said Perot Systems could get as much as $100 million a year from the contract.    Last Thursday, the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals ordered the suspension of the Perot Systems contract pending its action on the EDS protest. On Friday, the Postal Service announced that although the pact was &quot;one valuable and innovative approach to finding new and more efficient ways of operating . . . we have notified Perot Systems that we are suspending all work on this contract.&quot;    Mr. Frank told the Postal Service board of governors that the agency may have to scrap the contract altogether. If &quot;suitable and appropriate&quot; modifications can't be agreed to, &quot;then we will be forced to cancel the contract,&quot; he said.    The next rounds will be fought in court and on Capitol Hill. The Postal Service has asked a federal court to rule that the GSA board doesn't have jurisdiction over its contracts. But Mr. Frank concedes that, whatever happens in court, the contract will have to be &quot;modified&quot; to be acceptable to Congress. Mr. Frank won't elaborate, but one Congressional aide says the Perot contract probably will have to go out for competitive bids after all.    Mr. Frank is frustrated. &quot;It will be a loss to the American people if the contract is canceled,&quot; he said.    Mr. Perot, meanwhile, is clearly angry. He says he will counterattack by competing against his old company, EDS, for commercial contracts. Even though Perot Systems has just two dozen employees compared with EDS's 48,000, Mr. Perot seems eager for the fight. &quot;Once you bomb Pearl Harbor,&quot; he says, &quot;and they just did, then you're in the war.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
