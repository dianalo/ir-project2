Dorfman</HL><DD> 10/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The stock market's nervous stomach calmed down a bit Friday, but investors were still in discomfort.    Most stocks fell during the abbreviated trading session, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average, composed of 30 large blue-chip stocks, inched up 0.33 to 1950.76. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,048 stocks dropped in price and 670 rose. The tally on the American Stock Exchange was 536 declines and 249 advances.    The Big Board and other major exchanges closed at 2 p.m., two hours earlier than usual, to give brokerage houses time to sort through piles of paperwork from the unprecedented hailstorm of trading last week.    Big Board volume for the shortened session was 245.2 million shares. That was the smallest total of the week, but still the 10th-busiest session in history. The previous four days had the four highest daily trading volumes ever, ranging from 392.2 million to 608.1 million shares.    Contributing to Friday's relative quiet, the Big Board continued to discourage &quot;program trading&quot; based on arbitrage between stocks and stock-index futures. &quot;They probably won't bring back the programs until things calm down,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.    On the New York Stock Exchange, the average stock was down about 1%, weighting all issues equally. On the American Stock Exchange, the typical issue lost about 1.8%.    Most market professionals seemed to agree with Mr. Wachtel that &quot;the panic is petering out.&quot; But few seemed in any hurry to buy shares.    &quot;No bear market in history has lasted less than two months, to my knowledge,&quot; said Geraldine Weiss, the editor of Investment Quality Trends, a newsletter published in La Jolla, Calif. &quot;Probably we can expect the low (of around 1700 on the industrial average last week) to be violated.&quot;    If prices do sink to around the 1700 level, Ms. Weiss thinks there are bargains to be had among drug companies, oil-patch companies and some banks. Of the 350 stocks she follows, she currently considers 26% to be undervalued, compared with only 14% less than two weeks ago.    Ms. Weiss puts considerable stress on the dividend yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. At the market's peak in August, the yield was well under 3% -- a level historically associated with market tops. Based on current dividend levels, a 1766 reading on the industrial average equates to a 4% yield, which she regards as a support level. At the moment, the yield is 3.6%.    People are &quot;talking about 20% earnings growth in the third quarter, but dividends rose only about 2%,&quot; she said. If companies raise fourth-quarter dividends meaningfully, she thinks it could help the market rebound.    There are &quot;some very good values in that 1700 area (of the industrial average), for an investor who wants to play the upswing within the confines of a bear market,&quot; Ms. Weiss said. &quot;That would be the time to start accumulating some good stocks.&quot;    Donald G. Coxe, chief portfolio strategist for Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. in New York, has a different favorite measure of the market -- the so-called TED spread.    The TED spread is the difference in yield between Treasury bills and Eurodollar deposits (dollar-denominated time deposits at banks in Europe). The difference is usually about 100 basis points, or 1%, Mr. Coxe said. During times of financial crisis, the spread widens, as people flee to the relative safety of Treasury bills.    &quot;I refer to it as the electrocardiogram of the financial system,&quot; Mr. Coxe said. A reading of 80 to 120 is in the normal range, he said, while &quot;200 is a major heart attack.&quot;    In early October, the TED spread rose to about 134, Mr. Coxe recalled. It hit 200 before the opening last Monday, the day the market crashed. Friday, the spread still gaped wide, at 174 to 177 basis points, so in Mr. Coxe's view, it is &quot;still flashing crisis levels.&quot;    Mr. Coxe said that economic figures released Friday clearly gave some encouragement to investors. Citing government reports that real gross national product grew at an annual rate of 3.8% in the third quarter and inflation stood at only 0.2% in September, Mr. Coxe said &quot;Those numbers are the kind that you wish you were running for re-election on.&quot;    Mr. Wachtel agreed that the economic reports looked good, but said, &quot;The news of the day really is meaningless. The key question is: 'Are we out of the foxholes,'&quot; referring to whether economic growth will withstand the shock of October's market turbulence. &quot;No one can project (third-quarter numbers) and say that the fourth quarter will look good, too.&quot;    On Friday, some stocks moved substantially on takeover or other news. Jewelcor said a group led by its president and chief executive officer, Seymour Holtzman, is considering a $16-a-share leveraged buyout offer for the shares it doesn't already own. Following a delayed opening, the shares rose 1 3/4 to 14 7/8.    Procter andamp; Gamble jumped 4 1/8 to 82. Pandamp;G said it would cooperate with Upjohn in a long-term program to develop and market hair-growth products. Upjohn dropped 5/8 to 31, despite an announcement that it would purchase as many as 7.5 million of its own shares.    CBS dropped 6 3/4 to 159 1/4. The broadcaster said it plans to reorganize its domestic record operations, but added that the move &quot;should not be construed as a decision . . . to sell or spin off&quot; the record operations.    Western Union rose 3/8 to 3, a 14% gain. It reported third-quarter profit of $2.6 million, compared with a loss of $46.5 million a year earlier. The latest results were helped by the sale of some cellular telephone interests.    Newhall Resources rose 7/8 to 7. Newhall Land andamp; Farming, the company that spun off Newhall Resources in 1983, wants it back, and said it is offering $7.50 for each unit of Newhall Resources, which is a publicly traded limited partnership.    Wickes, which said Thursday it plans to sell some of its operating units for $600 million and use the proceeds to retire debt and buy back stock, rose 1 3/8 to 9 7/8.    Stifel Financial fell 2 1/8 to 7 3/4. Last month, it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Kuhns Brothers andamp; Laidlaw. Stifel made no announcements Friday, but many takeover pacts have come unglued in the recent market turbulence.    DynCorp, which also has been in the news as a takeover candidate recently, jumped 2 3/4 to 16 3/4. </TEXT></DOC>
