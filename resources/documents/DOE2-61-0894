Two models in which the H fielddefines spatial three-spaces are investigated. One is quasi-chaotic atearly times and leads to uniform expansion of all dimensions at latertimes; the other gives preferential expansion of one three-space. Onepossibility for the transition to the observed universe, through particleproduction by the dilaton field, is studied.</TEXT></DOC>
