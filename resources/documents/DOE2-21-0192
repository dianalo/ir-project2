In assessing the likely adequacyof labor supplies for commercial nuclear power job openings over thenext 5 yr, consideration has been given to competing sources of labordemands, including nuclear energy research and development activities,nuclear defense, and the total US economy, and to the likely supply ofnew graduates. In particular, over the last 3 yr, the number of degreesawarded and enrollments in nuclear engineering programs have declined12 and 14%, respectively, and in health physics programs, 5 and 14%,respectively. For health physics and nuclear engineers, tight labor marketconditions (i.e. labor supplies and demand balanced at relatively highsalaries) are expected over the next 5 yr because of declining enrollmentsand slowly growing employment levels plus job replacement needs. Thecommercial nuclear power field is expected to face tight labor marketsfor electrical and materials engineers because of strong competing demandsin the economy. Other engineering occupations are likely to have adequatesupplies for the nuclear power field but at salaries that continue tobe relatively higher than salaries for other professional occupations.</TEXT></DOC>
