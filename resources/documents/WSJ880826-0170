The well, Exxon Fee No. 22, was drilled to a depth of 16,163 feet and encountered 358 feet of gas. The well tested at 24.9 million cubic feet of gas and 97 barrels of condensate a day from a 21/64-inch opening at depths of 15,170 feet to 15,214 feet.    Much of the natural gas from the 6,800acre field will be sold under a contract that calls for prices &quot;substantially above current market prices,&quot; Freeport-McMoRan Energy said. Freeport-McMoRan Energy is an affiliate of New York-based Freeport-McMoRan Inc.    Freeport-McMoRan Energy, which operates the well and expects it to be in production in November, owns an 87.5% stake in the well; CXY Energy Inc. owns 7%; and other investors own the remaining 5.5%. </TEXT></DOC>
