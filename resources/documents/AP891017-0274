A halt in other labor negotiations with Boeing also shows theworld's largest commercial airplane builder ``isn't going to getserious with any other group until they settle with us,'' said TomBaker, president of District Lodge 751 of the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.   Discounting the likelihood of a quick settlement fromnegotiations that resume Wednesday, Baker said voting down a secondcontract offer could leave both sides even more entrenched andfarther apart.   ``That's why we, on this side of the table, have to be socautious about taking anything back to the membership that couldpossibly be rejected,'' he said.   Of the 57,800 Boeing workers represented by the Machinists,43,300 in the Puget Sound area are covered by the district lodge,while 12,000 other Machinists are in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 inPortland, Ore., and a few hundred at scattered sites in California,Utah, Hawaii, Montana and other states.   Amid growing reports of airline concern over delivery delays,talks were set to resume Wednesday afternoon in the office offederal mediator Douglas Hammond, who called the two sides togetherfor the first talks since Oct. 2.   The strike began Oct. 4 after an 85 percent vote to walk outrather than accept a three-year contract with wage increases of 4percent the first year, 3 percent the second and 3 percent thethird; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3percent the second; cost-of-living boosts virtually matchinginflation; and higher benefits.   ``The money package is first. We have to improve that moneypackage. Everything else is second,'' Baker said.   To end the strike, Boeing must offer more money than would havebeen required to win approval Oct. 3 and further ease the number ofovertime hours workers must put in, as well as make concessions inother areas, he said. He declined to be more specific.   The rejected offer would have reduced mandatory overtime from200 hours a quarter to 160 hours. As strikers spend more time withtheir families ``that has become a real hot issue,'' Baker said.   Boeing contends it needs the overtime work to keep up with ahuge backlog of jet orders.   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr refused to say whether thecompany's negotiators would have a new offer Wednesday.   ``If the company doesn't have a better offer, then these talksare kind of futile,'' said Jack Daniels, communications directorfor District Lodge 751.   Members of the United Aerospace Workers Local 1069, representingabout 3,200 production and maintenance workers at BoeingHelicopters near Philadelphia, voted Sunday to approve anindefinite extension of their contract, which previously wasextended 10 days.   Carr said Tuesday the issues there were similar to those for theMachinists. ``They'll wait now until the IAM settles, I'd expect,''he said.   Boeing negotiators walked out Monday in the first day ofnegotiations with the company's second-largest union, the SeattleProfessional Engineering Employees Association, citing ``grosslyexcessive'' pay demands.   Those talks, which cover 28,000 engineers and technical supportworkers, about 95 percent in the Puget Sound area, will resume nextMonday at the request of a federal mediator, said Dan Mahoney,general counsel to the unaffiliated union. The association'scontract expires Dec. 1.   Boeing delivered two aircraft Monday, a 767 to Lauda Air ofAustria and a 757 to United Airlines, bringing to seven the numberof jets delivered during the walkout.   Dick Shimizu of America West Airlines said the Arizona-basedcarrier was told a 757 it was expecting Thursday wouldn't bedelivered until Nov. 7, delaying the the start of four daily routesout of Houston from Nov. 6 to Jan. 12, but a 737 scheduled fordelivery in December should be on time.</TEXT></DOC>
