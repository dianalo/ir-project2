Box 231,Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition(PP) 8E3616 to EPA on behalf of Dr. Robert H. Kupelian, National Director,IR-4 Project, and the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Arkansas, Oklahoma,Florida, and Texas, and the U.S. Department ofAgriculture.This petition requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e)of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose the establishmentof a tolerance for the combined residues (free and bound) of the herbicidemetolachlor (2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)acetamide)and its metabolites, determined as the derivatives, 2-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)amino]-1-propanoland 4-(2-ethyl-6-meylphenyl)-2-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-morpholinone, each expressedas the parent compound, in or on the raw agricultural commodity bell peppersat 0.1 part per million (ppm).The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for whichthe tolerance is sought. The toxicological data considered in support ofthe proposed tolerance include:1. A 90-day dog feeding study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of500 parts per million (ppm) (12.5 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)).2. A 6-month dog feeding study with a NOEL of 100 ppm (2.5 mg/kg).3. A rat teratology study with no maternal, teratogenic, or fetotoxic effectsat all levels tested (0, 60, 180, and 360 mg/kg/day).4. A rabbit teratology study with a NOEL for maternal effects at 120 mg/kgand no teratogenic or fetotoxic effects at all levels tested (0, 36, 120,360 mg/kg/day).5. A 2-year oncogenicity study in mice with no observed oncogenic potentialunder the conditions of the study at 30, 1,000, and 3,000 ppm (highestdose level equivalent to 428 mg/kg); and a systemic NOEL of 1,000 ppm;and a repeated mouse oncogenicity study with no observed oncogenic potentialunder the conditions of the study at the same dose levels as the originalstudy.6. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a reproductive NOEL of300 ppm (15 mg/kg) and a lowest effect level (LEL) of 1,000 ppm (50 mg/kg).7. Mutagenicity studies including: a mouse dominant-lethal study, negativefor mutagenic effects; a mouse lymphoma mutation assay, not a mutagen inboth presence and absence of metabolic activator; two DNA damage/repairin fibroblasts and in rat hepatocytes, both negative; an Ames assay, negativefor mutagenic effects; and a Chinese hamster micronucleus assay with noevidence of mutagenicity at dosage levels tested (0, 1,250, 2,500, and5,000 mg/kg).8. A 2-year chronic feeding/oncogenicity study (IBT validated) in the ratconducted at dietary doses of 0, 30, 300, and 3,000 ppm with a statisticallysignificant increase in primary liver neoplasms in females at the highdose (equivalent 150 mg/kg).9. A repeated 2-year chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in the rat conductedat the same dietary doses as the original study with a systemic NOEL of300 ppm (15 mg/kg), a systemic LEL of 3,000 ppm (150 mg/kg) (testicularatrophy), and a statistically significant increased incidence of neoplasticliver nodules and proliferative hepatic lesions in females in the high-dosegroup (equivalent to 150 mg/kg/day).The Agency has concluded that the available data constitute limited evidencefor carcinogenicity of metolachlor. Metolachlor has been tentatively classifiedas a Category C carcinogen (limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals)based on the following considerations:1. The oncogenic responses observed in rats were confined to the high-dosefemales at one site (liver).2. The proliferative liver lesions observed in rats were primarily benign(neoplastic nodules in 6 of 60 animals) rather than hepatocellular carcinomas(1 of 60 animals). There was no apparent difference in the time-to-occurrenceof the lesions (almost all liver tumors were observed at terminal sacrifice).3. Metolachlor was not oncogenic to mice under the conditions of the 2-yearmouse oncogenicity studies.4. An Ames mutagenicity assay and a dominant-lethal study were negativefor mutagenic effects.An oncogenic risk assessment for metalochlor has been completed by theAgency based on the available information. The potential oncogenic riskfrom dietary exposure resulting from the proposed use on bell peppers andexisting uses of metalochlor is calculated at 2 X 10-6. The dietary riskassessment is based on a potency estimator (Q*) of 2.1 X 10-3 (mg/kg/day)-1and dietary exposure as calculated by the theoretical maximum residue contribution(TMRC) for established tolerances (0.001167 mg/kg/day).Tolerances previously have been established for residues of metolachorranging from 0.02 ppm in meat, milk, poultry, and eggs to 30.0 ppm in peanutforage and hay. Tolerances have also been established for residues of metolachloron both chili and tabasco peppers at 0.5 ppm. Based on the rat chronicfeeding study with a NOEL of 300 ppm (15 mg/kg/day) for nononcogenic effectsand using a 100-fold uncertainty factor, the reference dose (Rfd) is 0.15mg/kg/day. The theoretical maximal residue contribution (TMRC) for existingtolerances is 0.001167 mg/kg/day. The proposed use will contribute an additional0.000003 mg/kg/day (0.3 percent increase). Published tolerances utilize0.78 percent of the RfD. The Agency concludes that the amount of the pesticideadded to the diet from the proposed use will not significantly increasedietary exposure. Thus the tolerance established by the proposed rule isconsidered to pose a negligible incremental risk.The nature of the residues is adequately understood and an adequate analyticalmethod, gas-liquid chromatography with an electrolytic detector specificfor nitrogen, is available for enforcement purposes. Analytical enforcementmethods are currently available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, (PAM),Vol. II. There are currently no actions pending against the continued registrationof this chemical.Based on the above information considered by the Agency and the fact thatbell peppers are not considred an animal feed commodity, the toleranceestablished by amending 40 CFR 180.368 would protect the public health.Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerance be established as set forthbelow.Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registrationof a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein,may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that this rulemaking proposal be referred toan Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document controlnumber, [PP 8E3616/P493]. All written comments filed in response to thispetition will be available in the Information Services Section, at theaddress given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, exceptlegal holidays.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 tat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising requirements donot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Repording and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6"> Anne E.
