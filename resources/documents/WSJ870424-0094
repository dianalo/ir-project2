Lawyers for the oil companies reached the agreements at the home of one of Pennzoil's lawyers early yesterday morning. The accords were then presented to the U.S. bankruptcy court, which approved them at a sparsely attended hearing.    &quot;There are more things going on at home in this case than one can imagine,&quot; bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg said when he heard the first of three accords, later teasing the battery of lawyers for the oil companies, &quot;It's nice to see that you sophisticated lawyers can resolve bankruptcy by agreement and not by controversy.&quot;    The attorneys said they reached the agreements while having coffee at the home of one of the lawyers.    The judge also approved two other agreements reached by Pennzoil and Texaco prior to the hearing. Pennzoil agreed to let Texaco pay royalty leases, severance taxes and working interest payments totaling $87 million, with a $2 million limit on any such payments to any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.    Without such an agreement, Texaco could lose many of its leases as payments lapse.    Pennzoil also agreed to permit Texaco to honor a contract with Houston-based Applied Drilling Technology Inc., which is drilling a well for Texaco in the Gulf of Mexico, said Texaco lawyer Harvey Miller.    &quot;We were confident that Texaco would treat us fairly,&quot; said Thomas Short, president of Applied Drilling, a unit of Global Marine Inc., which entered bankruptcy-law proceedings last year.    The agreements and court orders are part of Texaco's bankruptcy-law proceedings involving its April 12, 1987, filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 11 protects a company from creditor lawsuits while the concern works out a plan of reorganization.    Texaco filed under Chapter 11 to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgement against it awarded to Pennzoil in December 1985 by a Texas court.    Pennzoil had sued, charging Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil Co. had interferred with Pennzoil's prior contract to acquire part of Getty.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Texaco closed at $31.50 a share, up $1.25. Pennzoil closed at $74, down $1.50. </TEXT></DOC>
