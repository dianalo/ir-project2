test foridentifying the copyrightable elements in software.andP;  This, however, isactually what occurred, regardless of any contrary impression you might havegleaned in the general media.andM;To be fair, most news accounts made no mention of this aspect of the case,though at least one journalist-whom I won't name-asserted that the judge hadruled that Lotus was entitled to protection for &quot;  look and feel' elements of1-2-3.&quot; 1 guess this illustrates the hazards of venturing to comment upon ajudicial decision before one has carefully read it.andM;Having had this opportunity, I'll now convey the highlights of the judge'sanalysis, because I feel that this opinion could turn out to be influential.andO;Although the decision was made at the trial court level, it is not bindingupon any other court.andP;  (And of course the possibility exists that JudgeKeeton's decision might be upset on an appeal.)andM;The reason for my hunch, that this exposition of copyright law may beimportant, is that it's what I anticipated-a scholarly, methodical analysisthat doesn't duck the difficult questions.andP;  This isn't to say it's an easyread.andP;  On the contrary, it's so tightly organized and compactly written thatI suspect most people without legal backgrounds would find it rough going.andO;It's also lengthy-the fine-print text before me runs 41 pages.andP;  Therefore,the discussion here cannot be any substitute for a close reading of thejudge's opinion, but I'll do my best, sparing you the technicalities.andM;First, we must put Judge Keeton's decision in its legal context.andP;  The USSupreme Court never has spoken on the question of just what a softwarecopyright embraces.andP;  Nevertheless, it's now pretty much a settled propositionof US law that the &quot;literal&quot; aspects of computer programs-such things as flowcharts and actual code-are protected by the copyright laws.andP;  The legaluncertainty as to what constitutes infringement of a software copyrightbegins when there has been no literal copying of code, but circumstancesreveal similarities between programs in other respects.andM;One decision by a federal Court of Appeals, Whelan vs.andP;  Jaslow (UNIX Review,Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  5), has provided aid and comfort for advocates of a &quot;look andfeel&quot; test for copyright infringement.andM;This lawsuit involved the marketing of an unauthorized PC version of aprogram originally written in EDL for IBM mainframes.andP;  The 3rd Circuitreached the conclusion that copyright protection could &quot;extend beyond theprograms' literal code to their structure, sequence, and organization.&quot;andO;Later, a federal district judge relied on this conclusion to determine inBroderbund Software vs.andP;  Unison World (Vol.andP;  6, No.andP;  12) that the visualdisplays in a knock-off version of a printing program constituted copyrightinfringement.andM;But there was a contrary ruling by a court of appeals as well.andP;  In PlainsCotton Cooperative Association vs.andP;  Goodpasture Computer Service, Inc., apanel of the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit declined to follow thePhiladelphia-based 3rd's Whelan decision.andP;  However, the 5th Circuit didn'thave a completed lawsuit before it for review, but only the trial judge'sdenial of the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction.andP;  Theappellate court's inquiry was limited to the question of whether the trialjudge had abused his discretion by denying the request, so it doesn'tconstitute a strong legal precedent in opposition to Whelan.andP;  Perhaps it wasfor this reason that the Supreme Court refused to step in to resolve a splitin the appellate circuits.andM;This was essentially, in the way of judicial precedent to assist Judge Keetonin resolving the dispute between Lotus and Paperback.andP;  He therefore wasobliged to look to the language of the copyright statute itself, and there hediscovered, as he wrote in his opinion, that &quot;Congress has not explicitlyaddressed some of the questions that must be decided in this case.&quot; To answerthese questions, the judge turned to the legislative history of the copyrightlaw, and to the court decisions in other contexts.andM;Briefly, here's what was at issue: In the spring of 1985, news beganappearing in trade publications that Paperback was preparing to release itsVP-Planner program, which was said to &quot;look and work like Lotus 1-2-3&quot;-that,of course, being Lotus Development's popular spreadsheet program.andP;  VPPlannerappeared on the market that October, but Lotus took no legal action untilJanuary 1987-by which time the Whelan and Broderbund decisions previouslymentioned had been handed down.andP;  In the lawsuit that it then filed, Lotusalso named as a defendant Mosaic Software, which had begun marketing aspreadsheet program called The Twin, but because Mosaic's attorney becameill, the trial proceeded against Paperback only.andM;The progress of Lotus' suit against Paperback illustrates the importance ofmarshalling the facts so as to put your own legal position in the mostfavorable light.andM;Apparently, the lawyers for Lotus did a good job.andP;  With respect to a keyissue, for example, the judge wrote thatandM;I credit the testimony of expertandM;witnesses that the bulk of theandM;creative work [in softwareandM;development] is theandM;conceptualization of a computerandM;program and its user interface,andM;rather than in its encoding, andandM;that creating a suitable userandM;interface is a more difficultandM;intellectual task, requiringandM;greater creativity, originality, andandM;insight, than converting the userandM;interface design into instructionsandM;for the machine.andM;That, I would say, was nine-tenths of the battle won by Lotus, for itestablishes that the creation of a user interface is an act of authorship,and that it can satisfy the requirement of originality specified by thecopyright law.andM;The trial disclosed that VP-Planner had its genesis in an effort begun by Dr.andO;James Stephenson in January 1982 to develop a successor spreadsheet to thepioneer VisiCalc.andP;  By January of the following year, he had developed much ofthe user interface, and in April installed an operational version of hisspreadsheet program.andP;  in the meantime, in February 1983, he had seen Lotus1-2-3 in operation for the first time.)andM;Late in 1983 Stephenson entered into a letter of intent with Adam Osborne forpublication of VP-Planner, and Osborne organized Paperback Software.andP;  Then,events took a momentous turn.andM;Throughout 1984, defendantsandM;continued to improveandM;VP-Planner.andP;  In the autumn, theyandM;recognized the success of 1-2-3andM;and reached the conclusion thatandM;spawned this litigation: VPandM;-   Planner, in order to be aandM;commercial success, would haveandM;to be  compatible' with 1-2-3.andM;According to the judge,  TheandM;only way to accomplish thisandM;result was to ensure that theandM;arrangement and names ofandM;commands and menus inandM;VP-Planner conformed to that ofandM;Lotus 1-2-3.'andM;This meant that users would have to be able tox transfer spreadsheets createdon 1-2-3 to VP-Planner without loss of functionality, and that they wouldhave to be able to switch to VP-Planner from 1-2-3 without retraining.andM;As things now stand, at least, Stephenson and Osborne succeeded all too well.andO;They revised VP-Planner's menu structure to conform to 1-2-3, made certainthat keyboard sequences would bring about the same result in both programs,added 1-2-3 functions that VP-Planner previously hadn't supported, anddiscarded beneficial VP-Planner functions that were inconsistent with thecompatibility requirement.andP;  When they were finished, the VP-Planner manualcould truthfully state,andM;VP-Planner is designed to workandM;like Lotus 1-2-3, keystroke forandM;keystroke....andM;VP-Planner's worksheet is aandM;feature-for-feature workalike forandM;1-2-3.andP;  It does macros.andP;  It has theandM;same command tree.andM;It allows the same kind ofandM;calculations, the same kind ofandM;numerical information.andM;Everything 1-2-3 does,andM;VP-Planner does.andM;Considering these circumstances, Judge Keeton had little difficultyconcluding that VP-Planner represented a deliberate effort to appropriate thefeatures of Lotus 1-2-3.andM;But imitation, in and of itself, is not an illegal activity.andM;Before it can be concluded that copyright infringement has taken place, it'snecessary that the copied elements of a work be copyrightable.andM;It is the determination of this aspect that consumes the the judge's writtenopinion, and it is here that the judge brushed aside the &quot;look and feel&quot;test:andM;Despite its widespread use inandM;public discourse on theandM;copyrightability of nonliteralandM;elements of computer programs,andM;I have not found the  look andandM;feel' concept, standing alone, toandM;be significantly helpful inandM;distinguishing between nonliteralandM;elements of a computer programandM;that are copyrightable and thoseandM;that are not.andM;&quot;Look and feel&quot; proponents are, in effect, putting cart before horse; theconcept is analogous to the &quot;total concept and feel&quot; test used in casesinvolving traditional literary forms where copyrightability is assumed, &quot;todetermine whether forbidden copying had occurred.&quot;andM;Instead, the judge looked to each of the copyright law's requisites forcopyrightability.andP;  As we've mentioned, he found that the 1-2-3 interfaceconstituted an original work of authorship and that it was a nonobvious wayof expressing a command structure.andP;  In one of the most formidable sections ofhis opinion, the judge rejected the contention that the user interface wasintrinsically utilitarian, akin to an H-pattern gear shift arrangement in anautomobile.andM;When computer programsandM;include elements-both literalandM;and nonliteral-'that can beandM;identified separately from, andandM;are capable of existingandM;independently of, the utilitarianandM;aspects.andP;  .  ., they are potentiallyandM;copyrightable.andM;In short, the elements of 1-2-3 that Lotus sought to protect do not fall inthe category of unprotectable ideas, nor do they constitute a procedure,process, or system, which also are ineligible for protection.andM;The judge continued,andM;Accordingly, I conclude that it isandM;indisputable that defendantsandM;have copied substantialandM;copyrightable elements ofandM;plaintiff's copyrighted work.andM;therefore conclude that...andM;liability has been established.andP;  And that's where it stands.andP;  The customarydeclarations of intention to appeal have been made-though the dangling Mosaicaction may be a complicating factor-but at this stage we don't know what theultimate fate of this decision will be.andM;If Judge Keeton's ruling does survive any appellate challenge, it's worthnoting another aspect of it.andM;The judge has sought to undo the mischief injected by Whelan-and previouslycommented upon herewith respect to the significance of screen displays.andM;I emphatically reject defendants'andM;premise ...andP;  that equates the userandM;interface of 1-2-3 with 1-2-3'sandM;'screen displays.' In ruling thatandM;defendants have infringedandM;plaintiff's copyright, I have notandM;ruled that defendants are liableandM;because they copied the  ScreenandM;displays' of 1-2-3.andP;  Rather, I haveandM;concluded that defendantsandM;copied protected nonliteralandM;elements of expression in theandM;user interface and the unandM;computer program.... ItandM;not ...andP;  the screen displayandM;itself .. that is a copyrightableandM;'computer program' 'a set ofandM;statements or instructions ...andP;  toandM;bring about a certain result.'andM;The judge went on to observe that as a manifestation of the structure,sequence, and organization of the underlying program, the screen displayswould be afforded protection by the copyright in the entire work in thisbroader sense.andM;It follows, then, that computer programs are appropriately registered withthe Copyright Office as &quot;nondramatic literary works,&quot; using Form TX.andP;  On theother hand, registration as an  audiovisual work&quot;andM;is particularly appropriate whereandM;the chief function, and the bulkandM;of creative expression ...andP;  is theandM;creation of a series of pictorialandM;images on the computer screenandM;as with video games.andM;Right on, judge! Send the video games back to the arcades-don't let themmuddle up the copyright law for computer programs.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law He also has served as an administrative law judge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
