The action came amid growing anti-U.S. passion being whipped upto mark the 10th anniversary of the storming of the U.S. Embassy inTehran. Protesters plan to burn 160 American flags outside thecompound _ now a school _ on Saturday.   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Majlis, orparliament, unanimously approved a final version of the bill thatearlier had been passed by the 12-member Council of Guardians, aconstitutional watchdog body. The council acted after the 270-seatMajlis approved a first draft of the measure on Tuesday.   The law will remain on the books ``as long as the U.S. presidentis authorized to commit inhuman practices against the lives andinterests of Iranian citizens,'' the agency reported in a dispatchmonitored in Cyprus.   The Iranian move was in response to the Justice Department'sauthorization of the FBI to arrest suspected terrorists abroad andbring them to trial in the United States without the permission ofthe countries where they were located.   The U.S. move did not specify Iran. But it is one of severalnations accused of supporting and encouraging terrorism, includingthe kidnapping of Americans and other Westerners in Lebanon,assassinations and hijackings.   Iranian radicals clearly saw the Justice Department's action asaimed at the Islamic republic.   ``You who scream about human rights and talk about terrorism,are yourselves innately terrorists and criminals who have takensecurity away from the people of the world,'' said ParliamentSpeaker Mehdi Karrubi, a leading radical.   Several Iranian-backed Shiite militants in Lebanon are wanted bythe United States for hijacking a TWA airliner in 1985 and killinga U.S. Navy diver aboard the jet.   In 1987, FBI agents lured a Lebanese Shiite, Fawaz Younis,wanted for the 1985 Beirut hijacking of a Jordanian airlinercarrying U.S. citizens, to a yacht in international waters off theMediterranean island of Cyprus and arrested him.   A U.S. court recently sentenced him to 30 years in prison.   The new Iranian law allows the Tehran government to arrestAmericans deemed to have acted against Iranian interests anywherein the world and bring them to the Islamic Republic for trial byno-jury Islamic courts.   ``U.S. citizens and their agents, and countries whichcollaborate with the United States in kidnapping or endangeringIranian citizens or the interests of the Islamic republic, will betried by Iranian courts according to Islamic justice,'' the billdeclared.   ``We have to empower the president and officials of the Islamicrepublic to take reprisal measures'' to protect Iranians, Karrubisaid.   Tehran's radical daily Abrar said Capt. Will Rogers III,commander of the missile cruiser Vincennes when it mistakenly shotdown an Iranian airliner last year, should be the first personbrought to trial under the new law.   The Vincennes shot down the jetliner during fighting in thePersian Gulf in July 1988, killing all 290 people on board. TheNavy said the crew mistook the plane for an attacking Iranian F-14fighter jet.   Iranian radicals have been stirring anti-American passionsaround Saturday's anniversary of the Nov. 4, 1979, embassy seizure.   Militant Iranian students backed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeiniheld 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, helping to consolidate theanti-Western Islamic revolution.   As part of the celebrations, protesters will burn 160 Americanflags outside the embassy compound, now a school for Iran'sRevolutionary Guards Corps, in downtown Tehran, to commemorate 16Shiites executed in September by Saudi Arabia for bombings in theholy city of Mecca.   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini when therevolutionary leader died June 3, vowed to ``confront all aspectsof global arrogance throughout the world.''   ``Global arrogance'' is a favorite Iranian name for the UnitedStates.   Khamenei called the takeover of the embassy a ``historic event.''   ``With the capture of the American nest of spies ... thegigantic empire of cruelty and oppression in the contemporary worldwas at once overcome, and the dust of this humiliation will foreverremain on the faces of the arrogant leaders of America,'' Tehranradio quoted him as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
