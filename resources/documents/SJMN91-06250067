The firmsaid it would continue to meet any legal obligations to the men. The firm'snew legal counsel will determine over the next few weeks what thoseobligations are.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SALOMON HALTS PAY TO RESIGNED EXECSISOLATES MANAGERS IN BIDDING SCANDAL  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The board also decided the men would no longer be paid for office or otherexpenses. The executives have not yet moved from their offices, and thedecision indicates that if they do not do so, they will have to pay Salomonfor their space.;   In an apparent reference to any litigation that might stemfrom the decision, the firm said in a brief statement that if the executivesare &quot;ultimately found to be entitled to indemnification under applicable legalstandards, Salomon intends, of course, to honor that obligation.&quot;;   Thedecision is likely to prevent the executives from receiving a portion of athree-year, $100 million deferred payment pool scheduled to be distributed tothe firm's top executives early next year. Gutfreund is the only executive whois not a member of that pool.;   Robert Baker, a spokesman for the firm, saidthe conditions on the decision were there only because of legal limitations.&quot;The board went as far today as they can legally go,&quot; he said.;   Salomon'sdecision, in effect, isolates the firm's former top managers as investigationscontinue into the unfolding illegal bidding scandal in the treasury markets.;  The board's action is perhaps the most surprising for Gutfreund, who lastmonth was one of Wall Street's most powerful executives. Gutfreund resignedhis post days after Salomon disclosed that he and the other three executiveshad known of illegal bidding by the firm since April, but had failed to informthe government for four months.;   During testimony before a congressionalsubcommittee Wednesday, Warren Buffett, the new chairman of the firm, was toldthat Salomon should have no further financial dealing with the formerexecutives, a suggestion that appears to have been quickly accepted.;   &quot;Thereshould not be a dime spent by the firm to defend the wrongdoers&quot; Rep. JimSlattery, D-Kan., told Buffett. &quot;These men should be in striped suits,sweeping up Wall Street.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910906  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  438  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 6, 199100250067,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
