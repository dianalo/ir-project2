Ross Perot's controversial contract with the U.S. Postal Service has been nullified by the General Services Administration.    The ruling by the agency's Board of Contract Appeals, which was expected, doesn't end the running feud between Mr. Perot and Electronic Data Systems Corp., the company he founded and in 1984 sold to General Motors Corp. Mr. Perot left the company in a bitter dispute two years later. Earlier this year he founded Perot Systems Corp., which won the disputed Post Office contract. Electronic Data Systems was a major force behind efforts to derail the pact.    Anticipating the GSA ruling, Mr. Perot and the Post Office had already taken the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, saying the GSA doesn't have proper jurisdiction over the matter.    Modifications in the agreement that might address at least some of the criticisms leveled against it could be unveiled at a Senate hearing Wednesday. Postmaster General Anthony Frank promised such changes in the wake of the EDS protest and Congressional outcry over the contract, which gave Perot Systems the job of finding cost savings in the mail system's operations over the next 10 years.    The pact immediately drew fire because it was awarded without competitive bidding. The General Accounting Office began an investigation, and the U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution asking that the agreement be put on hold pending results of the study.    The GSA ruled Friday that the contract is &quot;illegal&quot; and therefore void. The board cited &quot;the failure to provide any advance notice of the contemplated award, the decision to proceed with a noncompetitive award in the face of clear knowledge that other companies existed with competency in this sort of work, and the failure to offer an adequate justification for making a sole source award.&quot; The GSA had suspended the contract pending the ruling by its board.    EDS, in a statement, said it is &quot;pleased that due process was served.&quot;    A spokesman for the Postal Service played down the significance of the GSA decision, saying it &quot;really doesn't change the fact that we're disputing their jurisdiction.&quot; In a statement, Mr. Perot said: &quot;We will await the outcome in federal court.&quot; It isn't known when that decision might be made. </TEXT></DOC>
