The companies said they'll share the installation costsand revenues from installing the natural gas pumps at certainChevron stations in PGandamp;E's service area, which coversnorthern and central California. The pumps will be connectedto PGandamp;E transmission lines and will eventually use naturalgas from both Chevron's reserves and PGandamp;E's supplies. AChevron station in Sacramento will be the first to get apump, sometime early next year.</LP><TEXT>   The companies didn't say how much they'll eventually spendon the plan. Chevron has some 600 stations in the utility'sservice area, but relatively few are expected to get naturalgas pumps, which cost between $250,000 and $400,000 toinstall. Profits could eventually run into the tens ofmillions of dollars, analysts said.   And while the profit potential is modest for the two bigcompanies, the alliance is important as a boost for naturalgas's future as a fuel for trucks and cars. It also marksanother step in industry's efforts to grapple with tougherpollution guidelines spelled out in the new Clean Air Act.Natural gas produces far less pollution than gasoline, costsabout 70 cents a gallon and is abundant in the U.S. Lastweek, in another boost for the fuel, Ford Motor Co. said itwill begin producing trucks that use natural gas next year.   Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron's chairman and chief executiveofficer, said the agreement with PGandamp;E should encourage thedevelopment and acceptance of natural gas vehicles. &quot;We'vegot a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation here, where peoplearen't going to accept natural gas vehicles if they can'tfind places to fill up their tanks, and you're reluctant tobuild places to fill up the tanks if you're only going to gettwo vehicles come through in a week,&quot; he said. Offeringnatural gas pumps at existing stations &quot;is the first steptoward overcoming that,&quot; he said.   The agreement is similar to one PGandamp;E struck this year withShell Oil Co., under which Shell will offer natural gas pumpsat some of its California stations. Richard A. Clarke, PGandamp;E'schairman and chief executive, has said that the companyeventually expects about $15 million to $20 million in annualprofit from the agreement with Shell.</TEXT></DOC>
