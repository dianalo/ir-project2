In long-awaited testimony before Parliament, Nakasone said hereceived $235,000 in political donations from the Recruit Co. from1982 to 1987.   It was his first public acknowlegement that he acceptedpolitical donations from the information and publishingconglomerate, but he said the contributions were reported accordingto law.   ``I am totally innocent,'' Nakasone told the Budget Committee ofthe House of Representatives. ``I refused to testify earlierbecause I have never done anything wrong.''   Opposition leaders contend Nakasone, prime minister from 1983 to1987, played a central role in the scandal that has seriouslyshaken public confidence in government. They demand his resignationfrom parliament.   Nakasone refused to step down, saying ``I will continue my jobto make a contribution to my country.''   While the former prime minister's voice was heard in a nationaltelevivion broadcast, cameras flashed only still pictures of agrim-faced Nakasone during more than two hours of testimony. Bylaw, TV cameras are banned at parliament sessions during testimonyof special witnesses.   Nakasone had acknowledged that three of his aides bought a totalof 29,000 Recruit shares and that profits from their sale after theissue went public were used for political activites.   He testified that sale of the shares had reaping the aides about$450,000.   Recruit had sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary to scores ofpeople prominent in government and business, including at least 17politicians or their aides. The buyers made large profits when theshares went on public sale.   Eleven of the 17 were members of Nakasone's Cabinet.   During questioning by Seiichi Inaba, a member of the oppositionJapan Socialist Party, Nakasone denied personal involvement in thestock purchases. ``These were economic acts by the individuals whopurchased them,'' he said.   For months, the opposition has demanded testimony in Parliamentfrom Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of dubious stockdeals and large political contributions by Recruit.   The governing Liberal Democrats refused until last week, callingthe demands ``improper'' because of Nakasone's status as a formerprime minister.   A long opposition boycott of debate on the budget changed that.   Liberal Democrats forced the budget through the House ofRepresentatives last month, but widespread criticism resulted and adeal was made: The opposition would not boycott the budget in theupper house if Nakasone testified before the budget committee.   Prosecutors have so far arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmenin the scandal on charges involving bribery and violations ofsecurities laws. They have also filed charges against two membersof Parliament.   On Monday, prosecutors charged lawmaker Takao Fujinami, aNakasone lieutenant and former chief Cabinet secretary, withbribery in the scandal.   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Socialist Party, thelargest opposition group, has accused Nakasone of doing Recruit aspecial favor that involved ordering Nippon Telegraph and TelephoneCo. and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to buymultimillion-dollar U.S. supercomputers.   Two of the supercomputers made by Cray Research Inc. were resoldto Recruit and helped establish it in leasing computer time andrelated telecommunications services.   Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of Nippon Telegraph andTelephone, which was a government monopoly until 1985, was arrestedand accused of taking bribes from Recruit in the form of thebargain stock shares.   The opposition also wants to know whether Nakasone recommendedHiromasa Ezoe, the former chairman of Recruit, for membership onseveral government advisory committees.   In a survey published today, support for the governing partyslipped to an all-time low.   According to a survey of 2,280 eligible voters conducted lastweekend by the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbum, support for theLiberal Democrats stands at just 26.5 percent, the lowest since itsfounding in 1955, while combined support for five oppositionparties stands at 26.7 percent. The survey said 44.1 percent ofthose polled supported no party.</TEXT></DOC>
