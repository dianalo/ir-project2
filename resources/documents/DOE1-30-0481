<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0481 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Health and Environmental Effects Profile for Brominated diphenyl etherswas prepared by the Office of Health and Environmental Assessment, EnvironmentalCriteria and Assessment Office, Cincinnati, OH for the Office of SolidWaste to support listings of hazardous constituents of a wide range ofwaste streams under Section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct (RCRA). Both published literature and information obtained from Agencyprogram office files were evaluated as they pertained to potential humanhealth, aquatic life and environmental effects of hazardous waste constituents.Quantitative estimates are presented provided sufficient data are available.Pentabromodiphenyl ether, Octabromodiphenyl ether and Decabromodiphenylether are determined to be systemic toxicants. An Acceptable Daily Intake(ADI), defined as the amount of a chemical to which humans can be exposedon a daily basis over an extended period of time (usually a lifetime)without suffering a deleterious effect, for Pentabromodiphenyl etheris .00044 (mg/kg bw/day), for Octabromodiphenyl ether is .00062 (mg/kgbw/day) and for Decabromodiphenyl ether is .01 (mg/kg bw/day) for oralexposure.</TEXT></DOC>
