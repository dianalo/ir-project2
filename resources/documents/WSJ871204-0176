The GNP increase slowed from growth of 1.5% in the second quarter from the first period. Third-quarter GNP also rose 1.4% from a year earlier, the government said. GNP measures a nation's output of goods and services. The figures are adjusted for inflation and for seasonal factors.    The new data supported many independent and government forecasts that the West German economy is limping along this year and will continue to do so in 1988. The third-quarter growth brought to 1.5% the economy's expansion since the start of 1987, and economists generally expect growth for the full year will total 1.5% to 1.75%.    On Wednesday, the government, under pressure from critics in Germany and abroad, announced a series of measures to stimulate the economy. Economics Minister Martin Bangemann said Bonn is counting on these steps to lift economic growth to a 2% rate.    However, the stimulative package was widely criticized as inadequate to significantly spur the economy. Yesterday's cut in the German central bank's discount rate, to 2.5% from 3%, also is expected to do little to boost economic growth.    Many observers have called for the government to enlarge or accelerate planned tax cuts, options Bonn continues to resist because of concern about possible inflationary implications.    Third-quarter growth stemmed largely from domestic demand. Exports rose just 0.6% from a year earlier, while imports gained 4%. Government spending rose 1.3% and capital investments 6.9%, but construction spending sagged 0.1%.    The government's unemployment report, meanwhile, showed that the number of Germans out of work rose to 2,130,000 in November from 2,090,000 in October. Many West German policy makers have called attention to the country's jobless rate, which the Council of Economic Advisers recently predicted would soar above 9% in 1988. The council told the government that fueling economic growth was the only way to hold back the increase in the number of Germans without jobs. </TEXT></DOC>
