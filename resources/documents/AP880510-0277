Black Enterprise magazine's latest annual survey of the top 100black-owned industrial and service companies, released Monday,indicates black entrepreneurs are becoming more active in sectorsranging from manufacturing and advertising to construction andfranchising.   The entrepreneurs, many of whom are using non-traditionalfinancing techniques to acquire and restructure companies, aredifferent from traditional executives who have been with the samecompany for years, working to build it up.   The rise of black entrepreneurs mirrors developments in U.S.companies in general, many of which have been taken over or beenforced to restructure to face competition and an uncertain economy.   A key example is Wall Street attorney Reginald F. Lewis, whoheads TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., by far the largestblack-owned company. New York-based TLC Beatrice, a food processorand distributor formed from the $985 million leveraged buyout ofBeatrice International, also was the fastest-growing, according tothe survey.   In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of thetarget company with sales of its assets or from its cash flow.   TLC Beatrice was the first black-owned company to make more than$1 billion in annual sales and it posted revenue of $1.8 billion in1987. Its 61 businesses include Butterball turkeys and Good Humorice cream.   The buyout of Beatrice ``places Lewis on the cutting edge ofcorporate finance and gives him access to Europe, Latin America andAsia, three of the world's fastest-growing markets,'' the surveystated.   Another black entrepreneur, J. Bruce Llewellyn of PhiladelphiaCoca-Cola Bottling Co., has propelled the company into the No. 3slot on the list with $166 million in sales last year. Llewellynhas acquired several profitable companies through joint ventureswith other black entrepreneurs and has added 36 new routes to hisbottling operation.   He recently purchased another Coke bottling franchise inWilmington, Del., and expects to surpass $200 million in sales thisyear.   Other black business operators _ such as Gary L. White of TransJones Inc.-Jones Transfer Co. and C. Everett Wallace of City andamp;Suburban Distributors Inc. _ have used leveraged buyouts to puttheir companies in the top 100. They are in the process of sellingoff their nonperforming assets and setting up strict financialcontrols, the survey says.   Trans Jones, a transportation services company based in Monroe,Mich., is seventh on the list with $79.3 million in 1987 revenue.City andamp; Suburban, a Chicago-based beer distributor, rolled out $37million in sales. It tied for 16th place with Community Foods Inc.,a food retailer based in Baltimore.   Other companies on the top 100 list include:   _Johnson Publishing Co. Inc., second-ranked after TLC Beatrice,which saw its growth boosted by its cosmetics and hair-careproducts and its syndicated ``Ebony-Jet Showcase'' television show.   The Chicago-based company, which had $201.6 million in saleslast year, markets Fashion Fair products and publishes Ebony, Jetand Ebony Man.   _Construction firm H.J. Russell andamp; Co., ranked No. 4, continuesto show its strength in competitive bidding for contracts and hasbranched out aggressively into real estate development withGibraltar Land Inc., the survey stated. Russell, based in Atlanta,posted sales of $141.9 million.   _Motown Industries, No. 5 with $100 million in sales.
