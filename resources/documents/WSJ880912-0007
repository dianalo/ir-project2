Krebs, chairman and chief executive officer.    The only one of these he would identify is Santa Fe's mining operation. Mr. Krebs said in an interview he is also looking into joint ventures involving certain of the subsidiaries. He said he is evaluating all three options in an effort to pay down Santa Fe's debt and &quot;add value to the company.&quot; Santa Fe took on an additional $3.66 billion of debt as part of a restructuring started early this year. Under that plan, the company sold several non-core businesses and paid shareholders a special $4.7 billion distribution.    Mr. Krebs said he intends to announce plans to put into effect one of those options in &quot;a month or two.&quot;    Although he declined to forecast numbers, Mr. Krebs said he expects the transportation, energy and real estate concern to have a loss this year, compared with earnings of $345.7 million, or $2.37 a share, last year. The loss will result from the company's debt service and the book loss that will be incurred as a result of the sale of its Southern Pacific Transportation Co. unit. The loss, he said, &quot;should be a surprise to no one.&quot; He said he doesn't expect any administrative or legal actions to delay the sale of the Southern Pacific unit to a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp. beyond the end of this year.    Mr. Krebs also said he expects &quot;a nice increase&quot; in the parent company's operating profit over last year. He said all of the company's continuing businesses should do as well or better than last year, except for its energy business, where oil prices are averaging about $4 a barrel below what the company expected.    The Santa Fe unit that shows the greatest growth potential, he said, is Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. This was the first year the company mined silver, which will result in $5 million of operating profit. Next year, the company will begin mining gold. Mr. Krebs said he expects the gold mining operation to generate $50 million in annual revenue for the company by 1990. The mining unit is one of the companies under consideration for a partial public offering or spinoff to shareholders, he said.    Mr. Krebs said he intends to pay off $1.6 billion of Santa Fe's debt this year and possibly pay off an additional $1.9 billion in debt sooner than required by the financing arrangement. The company has six years from last March to pay off that portion of the debt. As previously reported, Santa Fe decided against selling off large chunks of its vast real estate holdings to help pay for the recapitalization, and instead will borrow against those assets.    Mr. Krebs disclosed that the company changed its original plan on the advice of Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., the Toronto-based real estate concern that holds an 19.6% stake in the company and has two representatives on Santa Fe's board. Olympia andamp; York convinced the company that it should retain about $500 million of the $800 million in real estate it originally planned to sell, he said.    Mr. Krebs also said the decision to borrow against the real estate instead of selling it will have the effect of reducing by about 10% the taxable portion of the special distribution to shareholders. Mr. Krebs said by borrowing against the real estate, instead of selling it off to generate income, more of the distribution can be considered as return of capital and therefore nontaxable.    He said Olympia andamp; York, which is run by the Reichmann family, has &quot;given me no indication&quot; that they intend to revive a takeover attempt of Santa Fe, &quot;but I don't speak for them.&quot;. He said Olympia andamp; York's board representatives have &quot;bent over backward to work for the company and all its owners&quot; since joining Santa Fe's board earlier this year.    He said he also has received no indication that Samuel Zell, chairman and chief executive officer of Itel Corp., may try to launch a takeover attempt against Santa Fe. Itel recently agreed to buy a 16.9% stake in Santa Fe from Henley Group Inc., a La Jolla, Calif., manufacturing concern and one-time Santa Fe suitor. Santa Fe has agreed to give Mr. Zell and another Itel representative seats on its board.    Mr. Krebs said he has met with Mr. Zell about six times since July, but has held no discussions about any joint ventures between Itel and Santa Fe. Chicago-based Itel is a leading rail car leasing company. </TEXT></DOC>
