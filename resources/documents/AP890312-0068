(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sister of American hostage TerryAnderson said Sunday that she fears ``The Satanic Verses''controversy has worsened relations between Moslem extremists and theWest and made his release seem unlikely.   ``The situation has fallen apart again,'' Peggy Say said after aprayer service for Anderson in his hometown in upstate New York.``It seems like every time we get close, something unpredictablehappens.''   Immediately after President Bush's inauguration in January, therewere signs that Anderson might soon be freed after nearly four yearsin captivity in Beruit, Lebanon, according to Mrs. Say. She didn'tspecify what signs, but said the political climate at the time wasmore encouraging than it had been in many months.   But she said she feared that the animosity that has arisen overpublication of ``The Satanic Verses'' by British author SalmanRushdi has damaged the political climate and made the release ofWestern hostages more remote.   The Iranian government has called for Rusdie's death on thegrounds that the novel is blasphemous.   ``The situation now is not very good,'' Mrs. Say said. ``Butwe're not going to give up.''   Anderson, 41, the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beruit. He is thelongest held of 13 foreign hostages.   About 100 residents of Batavia listened to a roll call of thehostages in a high school gymnasium and heard Mrs. Say urge them notto allow Anderson to be forgotten.   Mrs. Say believes that if Anderson's captors think the Americanpeople no longer care about the hostages, they will be killed.   ``Terry is counting us to keep his cause alive,'' she said.   Earlier, the Rev. David Scheider, principal of Notre Dame HighSchool, appealed for the nation to show support for the hostages.Scheider said Anderson's plight should be viewed from a humanitarianstandpoint and not politically.   Ex-hostages report that Anderson is being held in a closetblindfolded and has been beaten by his captors.   The service in Batavia was the first of a number of observancesas Anderson enters his fifth year of captivity. Another service isplanned Monday in Buffalo, N.Y., with Mrs. Say and the Rev. LawrenceJenco, who was imprisoned with Anderson for a time in the MiddleEast.   Ex-hostages and hostage families will gather in Washington onThursday for a service sponsored by the Journalists Committee toFree Terry Anderson and a group known as No Greater Love.   There also will be a service in Lorain, Ohio, Anderson'sbirthplace. Anderson moved to upstate New York when he was 6 andgraduated from Batavia High School in 1965.</TEXT></DOC>
