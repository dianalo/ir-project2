The use of torture continues to be widespread andsystematic, in some cases resulting in death.''   Turkey ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture in1988, the report said.   In September and November last year, the government announcedproposals governing length of detention, access to lawyers andprotection for prisoners of conscience. None of those proposals hasbeen enacted.   Under the government proposal, the maximum detention periodunder police custody would be reduced from 15 days to four to 10days, though longer detention would be permitted under emergencylegislation.   The government also proposed abolishing the death penalty for 13categories of offenses, but not for murder and political offensesthat produce the most death sentences, the report said.   ``While these draft amendments, if passed, would represent astep in the right direction, they nevertheless would fall short ofinternational standards in important respects,'' AmnestyInternational said.   The report included testimony from several prisoners who saidthey were tortured with beatings on the soles of their feet,electric shocks, showers of ice cold water and being hung by theirarms.   ``Torture is still routine even among those detained for only afew days,'' Amnesty reported.   The testimony of prisoners shows ``anyone is at risk fromtorture in Turkey, particularly if held on political grounds,'' thereport said.   ``Many prisoners sign confessions under torture which are thenused as evidence against them, in violation of internationalstandards,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
