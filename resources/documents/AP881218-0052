Thousands of police officers gathered in central Athens to electa 15-member executive committee for the Union of Lower RankingPolice Officers, the first in Greek police history.   Despite government objections, the union was set up earlier thisyear to represent officers with a rank of sergeant or below. Theunion now has 18,000 registered members, said Sgt. Kostas Siggounis,acting chairman of the union.   The government, which claims it is unconstitutional for policeofficers to form a union, has threatened them with transfers toremote provincial posts, administrative punishment and dismissal,union founders say.   Union elections took place in the provinces last week and allvotes will be counted in Athens on Sunday.   The Greek police is structured much like an army and is run bythe Ministry of Public Order, which has said that unionizationdisrupts the chain of command and ``the police hierarchy's method ofoperation.''   ``They are worried that we will start questioning orders andupset the hierarchy in the Greek police,'' said Yiannis Kotsis,another union member.   The Greek constitution forbids members of the police to go onstrike but ``doesn't say anything about forming a union,'' Kotsissaid. Because of his union activities, the officer has beentransferred from Athens, where he served for 17 years, to thenorthern town of Grevena, about 275 miles north of the capital.   Siggounis and other officers say their aim is to modernize theforce and secure better living and working conditions. A policeofficer's starting salary is $394 a month, Siggounis said.</TEXT></DOC>
