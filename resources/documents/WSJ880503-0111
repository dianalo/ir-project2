Jacobs (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TAXES </CO><TEXT>   The wait is almost over for many small-business owners.    Any day now, the Internal Revenue Service is expected to publish regulations that will explain what businesses structured as S corporations, partnerships and personal-service corporations must do to continue reporting results on a fiscal-year basis. The owners will then have 60 days to file Form 8716, &quot;Election to Have a Tax Year Other Than a Required Tax Year.&quot;    Not having to keep books on a calendar-year basis can mean big savings for such businesses. Alan E. Weiner, a tax partner with Holtz Rubenstein andamp; Co., says more than 50 clients of the small Melville, N.Y., accounting firm are waiting for the regulations. One of them &quot;is going to save $40,000 by keeping a fiscal year,&quot; he notes, adding that this will lower the client's total bill to about $100,000.    The regulations will also mean that 1987 individual returns can at last be filed by the thousands of people who, desiring to keep their businesses on fiscal years, were obliged to take extensions. The extensions were needed because the owners couldn't know exactly how much income to report until the regulations for fiscal-year election were published.    For regular corporations, earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and again when they are paid to the owners as dividends. The profit (or loss) from S corporations, partnerships and personal-service corporations, however, &quot;flows through&quot; directly to the owner and so applies, for tax purposes, only at that level.    This single-tax treatment is the big advantage of doing business through one of these entities. But if the business is on a fiscal year, it's also possible to defer the tax. For example, profits from an S corporation with a fiscal year ending June 30 aren't reported until the following April 15 -- almost 10 months later -- when the owner's individual tax return is due.    The 1986 tax act ended this deferral advantage by forcing S corporations, partnerships and personal-service corporations to switch to a calendar year by the end of 1987. Then, with 1987 almost over, Congress enacted a reprieve. The Dec. 22 legislation offered opportunities for retention of fiscal years but under requirements that created chaos for businesses and their accountants.    The complications, in the form of additional estimated tax payments and paperwork, are &quot;ridiculous,&quot; says Kaye Ferriter, a tax partner in the Boston office of Coopers andamp; Lybrand. &quot;All the clients I've dealt with have gone to a calendar year, because there were too many administrative and other issues to deal with.&quot; Adds Kevin Reilly, a tax partner in the Washington office of Pannell Kerr Forster, &quot;We have a lot of frustrated clients.&quot;    Some small-business owners, however, welcomed the 1987 legislation. &quot;The real benefit is that ultimately, income that would have been reported in 1987 will be reported in 1988, when the maximum (tax) rate is 28%&quot; for high-income individuals, explains Valerie C. Robbins, a tax manager at Washington accountants Beers andamp; Cutler. The maximum rate last year for individuals was 38.5%.    Ms. Robbins says that, in general, taxpayers who can gain by deferring 1987 income into 1988 should stick with a fiscal year. &quot;A 10.5-point advantage in most cases is worthwhile,&quot; she adds. (Exceptions include situations in which a business realized a loss in 1987 or wouldn't save enough to justify the added accounting expense.)    And if, as many tax specialists expect, Congress raises rates for next year, the fiscal year can be terminated to keep more income within 1988's lower rate. That would happen because the change from fiscal to calendar year would cause two year ends in 1988 -- the usual fiscal-year end, say June 30, plus the end of a short, six-month &quot;year&quot; ending Dec. 31. Thus, 18 months of profit would count as 1988 income.    This flexibility is a big incentive for keeping fiscal years, Ms. Robbins says. To see if such a strategy pays, however, results for the business have to be projected several years into the future, under a variety of tax scenarios.    Of course, all this extra work means bigger accounting bills. How much more? &quot;Each business is different,&quot; Ms. Robbins says. &quot;Depending on the work, fees could go up by 30%.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
