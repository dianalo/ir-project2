He assigned all 500 agentsin his office to the hunt, with assistance from city police and FBIagents nationwide.   ``I am ceasing all other investigations in our office,'' thelargest in the DEA, Stutman said. ``Every agent will be working onnothing else until we apprehend this suspect.''   The search was for Constible Farace, 28, a paroled killersuspected of firing four gunshots into undercover DEA Agent EverettHatcher on Tuesday. Hatcher had been trying to infiltrate a mob-runcocaine ring.   ``We've had leads. We've had calls. We're doing everything wecan,'' said Robert Strang, a DEA spokesman. ``Do we think we'reclose? We think we are. We're going to continue to follow theseleads until we find him.''   Hatcher, 46, was a 12-year veteran of the DEA in New York and itsfirst agent killed here since 1972. A Vietnam veteran, he wasunarmed when he was shot dead in his car in a remote area of StatenIsland.   Outside a funeral home in Booton, N.J., Hatcher's widow, MaryJane, blamed her husband's death on casual drug users who keep drugkingpins in business.   ``A good man has been taken from us,'' she said, struggling tokeep back tears. ``The loss that we feel is exceedingly deep, almostunbearable.''   ``Even through the grief and our loss, I must ask the question,who really killed Everett Emerson Hatcher? Who are the ultimateguilty parties who create the market for the poison which hevaliantly tried to remove from our society.   ``We middle-class suburban Americans. We casual users, wedabblers in drugs, keep the market in drugs an ever-increasingone,'' said Mrs. Hatcher.   Agents assigned to trail Hatcher during his meeting withsuspected drug dealers lost contact with him in heavy trafficshortly before finding him dead back at the meeting place.   The Daily News reported that Hatcher bought about five ounces ofcocaine from Farace in previous meetings and was negotiating alarger buy. The drug was thought to have been supplied by a Floridadistributor.   Among other goals, investigators had been seeking to determinewhether reputed mobster Gerard Chilli, allegedly a powerful figurein the Bonanno crime family, was involved in the drug ring.   Farace was paroled in June after serving eight years for akidnap-murder. His uncle and cousin are reputed to be members of theColombo organized crime family, the News, New York Post and New YorkNewsday reported.</TEXT></DOC>
