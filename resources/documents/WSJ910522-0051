Less attention has beenpaid to immigrant engineers themselves, who come to the U.S.from such countries as India, Taiwan, South Korea and eventiny Ireland.   A new study indicates that immigrant engineers aren'tgetting their due here. &quot;They're underutilized,underappreciated . . . and end up more likely to leave theirjobs,&quot; says Nancy DiTomaso, a Rutgers University professorwho has studied engineers at five big companies.   To help these immigrants better adjust, Ms. DiTomaso saysemployers ought to teach them some basics of Americanculture: how to act in meetings, work with peers andsuperiors, and gain choice assignments.   Although some companies tailor programs to theirforeign-born engineers, &quot;there's definitely room forimprovement,&quot; says Prakash Chandra, a native of India andhead of a group of Indian engineers in Silicon Valley. Mr.Chandra says it isn't even standard for companies to providelanguage training for their immigrant researchers, andmentoring programs aren't common either.   He singles out Intel as an exception: The big chip makerassigns veteran engineers from different national backgroundsto help guide groups of lower-ranking immigrants. &quot;It's aremarkable way for upper management to find out aboutworkers' frustrations,&quot; Mr. Chandra says.   Yet remedies aren't clear-cut. LSI Logic, a chip maker,employs more immigrants than natives in some engineeringareas. &quot;Then the challenge is making the Americans feelthey're not out of place,&quot; says Bruce Entin, a spokesman forLSI.                                                                                                          Industry Chafes at Limits   On Encryption Exports                                                                                                          GOVERNMENT restrictions on the export of encryptiontechniques are a barrier to improving computer security,industry executives say.   Encryption is a way to produce secret codes, or crackthem, by means of mathematical formulas worked out withlightning quickness by computers. Long a tool of spies,encryption is increasingly viewed as important to industry,because it can protect computerized information by rapidlycoding and decoding it.   U.S. officials argue that limits on encryption are neededto prevent renegade nations or terrorist groups fromobtaining these techniques. The trouble is, encryption isbased on well-known principles, which make it difficult tokeep out of unwanted hands.   Take, for example, public-key cryptography, a relativelynew way of securing computer messages. Despite U.S. limits onexports, Iraq has been able to master the intricacies of thistechnology -- and not by resorting to subterfuge. Drawing onpublic literature, three researchers at a military college inBaghdad created their own cryptographic system. Last year,they published their findings in an English-language journal.   The Iraq case rankles some computer executives because itunderscores the impracticality of current U.S. law. As itstands, companies only get around cryptographic controls byselling abroad weaker versions of their domestic products.But many resist this step. &quot;To have a U.S.-only product isn'ta good solution,&quot; says Eric Schmidt of Sun Microsystems.                                                                                                          Operating Software   Becomes More Versatile                                                                                                          THE TREND in operating software is toward one system thatfits all types of computers.   The most popular operating software today controls thebasic functions of only one class of machines. DOS-Windowssoftware runs just on Intel microprocessors, while AppleComputer's Macintosh software runs solely on Motorola chips.   In the future, consumers will be able to buy almost anykind of hardware and still use their favorite softwaresystems. Microsoft has widely publicized its efforts to builda &quot;portable&quot; version of DOS-Windows that will run onvirtually any processor. Apple has hinted that it has similarplans but has withheld details.   Now people close to Apple say the company's goals are evenmore ambitious than Microsoft's. Apple has assembled a secretteam of at least 100 engineers on a software projectcode-named &quot;Pink.&quot; The new system software, still at least afew years from completion, is being designed to run oneverything from a laptop to a mainframe.   What's more, &quot;Pink&quot; is supposed to work on machinespowered by dozens of processors, including someparallel-processing hardware that will keep pace with thefastest computers of today.                                                                                                          Machines Learn to Read   Tiny Numbers on Film                                                                                                          NEW MICROCHIPS make it possible for a machine to perform atedious task in the manufacture of photographic film.   At Eastman Kodak, management wants to free workers fromthe tiring task of reading tiny, fuzzy numbers at the edge ofrolls of film in order to catch manufacturing defects.Conventional image-processing computers can't perform such atask because the numbers are 0.09 inch high and 0.085 inchwide, so small that even a person must be less than eightinches from the film in order to read the numbers.   Using an experimental neuralnet chip from Intel, Kodak hasdevised a laboratory machine to do the same thing. After10,000 tests with the film flying by at 1,000 feet a minute,the device reads the numbers accurately 99.8% of the time.</TEXT></DOC>
