Two tugboats towed the disabled 20-year-old ferry from the westcoast port of Lysekil to Copenhagen.   Earlier Wednesday, a commission of government officials fromNorway, Sweden and Denmark boarded the ferry for the first time toevaluate the ship's safety standards.   The Nordic commission is expected to recommend new safetystandards for ferries traveling in Scandinavian waters.   A separate marine inquiry in Copenhagen, which this week heardtestimony from 24 witnesses to the disaster, exposed a series ofsafety omissions and blunders that may have contributed to the highdeath toll.   Police in Oslo, Norway, estimated 161 people died in the April 7fire, but said the figure was not final because it was stilluncertain how many passengers boarded the ferry. The Danish-ownedvessel was on an overnight run from Oslo to Frederikshavn, Denmark.   Police have said they suspect arson in the disaster.</TEXT></DOC>
