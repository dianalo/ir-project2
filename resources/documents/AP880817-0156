Throughout the convention week, Robertson held meetings withdelegations from states where he scored well in this year's seriesof primaries, urging them to be ``good Republicans'' and jump intothis year's election with a vengeance.   ``I want George Bush to win,'' Robertson said at one point.   And what impact would that have on his own future?   ``I'm a young guy, I can wait eight years,'' said the58-year-old television evangelist.   His supporters said that's just fine with them, and many arefinding ways to play a role in this year's election to show theirresolve.   ``We're not a bunch of loonies,'' said Ann Kincaid, who ranRobertson's Virginia campaign, but now works for Bush. ``It has todo with the maturity of what we're doing.''   Robertson had long been out of the running for the GOPpresidential nomination, but his role in the party far exceeded the88 delegates still loyal when he released them Tuesday night.   He was awarded a prime-time spot on the convention's podium, andeven drew a member of the Bush family when he decided to formallythrow in the towel. A sharply conservative platform approved by thedelegates reflected his stamp.   Even Bush's choice of conservative Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana asa running mate left Robertson elated.   ``On issues like school prayer and abortion ... he is right downthe line with evangelicals,'' Robertson said.   His backers were taking that cue.   ``I'm comfortable to know that I'm part of this party,'' saidJohn Rondeno, a New Orleans activist who ran a reception center forRobertson delegates. ``When you're outside, you have no influence.Sometimes you have to rebuild the foundation.''   The only surprise, backers argued, was how quickly they've beenable to make the transition.   ``I expected a little tug and a little struggle, but therewasn't,'' said Robertson spokeswoman Marlene Elwell.   ``That shows it's not just a man-centered thing,'' Mrs. Kincaidsaid. ``Pat woke them up, shook them up and pasted them to theRepublican Party. That's not something that's going to go away.''   Just as Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis worked to win overJesse Jackson without appearing too closely allied, Bush's forcesquietly courted the fundamentalists.   Robertson capped it with a ringing endorsement before a packedand cheering convention, and a national television audience. Thereare challenges for both sides.   Along the way, Robertson committed occasional gaffes that raisedeyebrows and doubts. At a news conference Wednesday, he was askedwhat he learned about his evangelical base.   ``I learned they were not a monolithic group,'' Robertson said.``The second thing I learned was that if they had supported me inthe strength that the black people supported Jesse Jackson, I wouldbe standing on the platform tomorrow night.''   In essence, the Robertson forces must show they are capable ofdelivering. Mrs. Kincaid said there are spirited races across herstate, and the Robertson forces must demonstrate they can turn outthe vote or risk being labeled paper tigers.   ``We've got to show the state of Virginia we're going to work inthe trenches,'' she said. ``We've got to show the Republican Partywe're in here for the principles and the philosophy and not justthe man.''   Bush, however, will face pressure to adhere to the sharplyconservative views that Robertson espoused through the end of hiscampaign, right to the floor of the convention.   Robertson's carried out his part of the bargain with a ringingendorsement and call to action, coupled with one of theconvention's sharpest attacks on Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.   ``Michael Dukakis is a card-carrying member of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union, an organization dedicated to removing allpublic affirmation of religious faith in America,'' Robertson said.``As president, Michael Dukakis will pack the courts with ACLUradicals.''   Of Bush.   ``This party is about to nominate a man that I have come torespect and admire,'' Robertson told the convention in televisionprime time. ``This man can and will lead our nation proudly intothe future.''   He described Bush as ``a principled conservative.''   ``I release my delegates and alternates who have come to thisconvention and urge you and all of my friends across America togive your enthusiastic support to our party, our candidates and ourpresidential nominee,'' Robertson said.   ``It matters to us and our children whether we vote Democrat orwhether we vote Republican,'' Robertson said.   To further that aim, Robertson has established a politicalaction committee, and Mrs. Kincaid said that will be linked withPACs in states across the country.   ``We feel confident it's happening throughout the whole UnitedStates,'' Rondeno said.</TEXT></DOC>
