Now, Carlton is facing its own energy crisis, asyesterday's tumble in its stock price showed.</LP><TEXT>   A rapid-fire series of acquisitions -- capped by itspurchases of Technicolor Holdings Inc. from Ronald Perelmanin 1988 and UEI PLC last year for $1.5 billion -- has madethe once-tiny London television-production company a majorforce in the world video market. It duplicates morevideotapes than anyone else. Its high-tech graphics machinesset industry standards. Its Zenith unit, 49%-owned byParamount Communications Inc., makes TV programs with suchstars as Michelle Pfeiffer and Tina Turner seen in 30countries.   Led by its chairman and chief executive officer, MichaelGreen, Carlton's pretax profits have risen nearly tenfold infive years. And at its height last year, the company's #1.7billion ($2.79 billion) market capitalization exceededSaatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC, a previous highflier whose foundersare friends of Mr. Green.   But suddenly, like Saatchi, Carlton appears to have lostits hustle. A vague warning from Mr. Green of slower profitsgrowth this fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, has contributed toa big fall in the company's share price. On the London StockExchange, Carlton dropped 43 pence a share yesterday to closeat 481 pence, off about 49% from last year's highs. Americandepositary receipts, in national over-the-counter trading,plunged $1.75 a share to close at $15.125.   Now, holders fear the stock may tread water until June,when the company posts first-half results, and beyond. Theperformance raises some discomforting questions aboutCarlton's operations and strategy. There are even whispersthat unless it pulls out of the slump, the much-fearedacquirer could one day be a target itself.   Acquisitive Carlton's price-earnings ratio -- whose loftyheights allowed the company to finance acquisitions throughshare issues -- now has plunged to below the U.K. average.That hampers Carlton's ability to finance acquisitions byissuing shares, and is a setback to Mr. Green's aims to makeCarlton big enough to compete against such rivals as SonyCorp. Carlton has recently been courting the U.K.'s ThamesTelevision, which it tried to buy in 1985.   Carlton &quot;has very much fallen from grace,&quot; says RobertElliot, fund manager at #6 billion Scottish AmicableInvestment Managers in Glasgow, Scotland. &quot;It is reasonableto assume we will not see it back on a premium, at least notthis side of a bull market.&quot;   Carlton is the latest casualty of the curious Britishfondness for boom-and-bust stories. In the past, the Londonmarket has propelled companies such as Saatchi and SirTerence Conran's Storehouse PLC retailing group toexaggerated heights, only to knock them to equally stunninglows when bad news surfaces. Now it seems to be Carlton'sturn.   Carlton's share-price gyrations reflect both currentproblems and its transition from growth stock toconglomerate. Mr. Perelman sold Technicolor at the righttime; tough competition is cutting margins at the unit, whichmay account for over a third of Carlton's profits. (Carltondoesn't disclose figures.) Moreover, high inflation andinterest rates are hurting the advertising market in Britain,a country Carlton depends on for 36% of revenue.   By branching out from its base in the back rooms oftelevision, Carlton is embarking on a riskier strategy tobecome a media colossus with operations in hardware,programming and broadcasting itself. The jury is out onwhether Mr. Green, 42 years old, will be as successful amanager as he has been a deal-maker. The question is whetherhe can make varied businesses work.   Mr. Green declined to comment for this article. But hetold Carlton shareholders two weeks ago that first-quarterrevenue and pretax profits &quot;show a respectable increase&quot; froma year earlier, in contrast to the &quot;healthy&quot; increase inprevious years. Holders who have spoken to him since say heexpects profits to grow faster next year after this year'spause.   Several holders say they are angry that Carlton failed toprovide earlier clues about the apparent slowdown. Theyremain confused about how long the situation will last. Theirbiggest fear is the apparent slowdown in the company's energymay become permanent.</TEXT></DOC>
