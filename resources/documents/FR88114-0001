Neville, (202) 632-6817.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2>On April 10, 1987, OPM published (at52 FR 11657) proposed regulations to amend 5 CFR Part 353 governing therestoration rights of employees who perform military duty or sustain compensableinjuries or illnesses. At the same time, the corresponding FPM chapterwas sent to agencies and unions for comment, and was made available tothe general public. We received comments from 22 agencies, almost all ofwhich were supportive of the new proposal and saw it as a substantial improvement.We also received comments from 3 unions and 1 individual. Key aspects ofthe proposal are summarized below along with a discussion of the more significantcomments received on both the regulations and the FPM, and OPM's decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Key Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Revises andSection;353.102 to clarify that restoration rights followingcompensable injury apply only to Federal employees. Also, adds a definitionof ``equivalent position'' and includes ``furlough'' in the definitionof ``leave of absence.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Deletes material in andSection;andSection;353.104 and 353.105 pertainingto how employees on military duty or injury compensation are to be carried.(This information is covered in more detail in FPM Chapter 353.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Revises andSection;353.106 pertaining to notification of rights andobligations to make clear that an employee has an obligation to use duediligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to return to duty as soonas he or she is able. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Revises andSection;353.201(b) to provide that an employee whose positionis reclassified during his or her absence is entitled to be consideredfor the regraded position in accordance with the provisions of Part 335of this chapter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Revises andSection;353.201(c) to clarify that the prohibition on demotingor separating an employee absent on military duty applies only when theindividual has restoration rights under title 38 of the U.S. Code. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Revises andSection;353.203 to clarify that OPM will provide placementassistance to an employee returning from military duty when it is not feasiblefor the employing agency to restore the individual. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Revises andSection;353.302 to change the focus from the time limitsto who is entitled to mandatory restoration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Deletes material in andSection;353.303 pertaining to the position towhich restored to reflect the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 2021(a)(A)(i) andthe expiration of the so-called Whitten Amendment that effectively removedthe requirement to obligate the position of an employee entering militaryservice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Deletes material in andSection;353.305 pertaining to conflicting restorationrights, since conflicting restoration rights should rarely be an issue.(These rights are discussed in FPM Chapter 353.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Deletes most of the material in andSection;353.308 on notice of appealrights. The right to appeal is covered in the new andSection;353.104. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Adds a new andSection;353.306 specifying that Reservists are entitledto a leave of absence to perform military duty. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Revises andSection;353.401 to remove repetitive and unnecessary materialand to clarify that employees of the legislative and judicial branchesdo not have appeal rights to the MSPB.

We are unable to comply withthis request for two reasons: </ITAG>1. Congress clearly intended that an employee returning from military dutybe restored as soon as practicable; and 2. The current 30-day provision is one of longstanding which has been generallyaccepted and proven workable. As such, it has taken on the characteristicsof a law and cannot be arbitrarily changed. <ITAG tagnum="15">_The proposed regulations provide for OPM placement assistance forexecutive branch employees returning from military duty when it is ``notfeasible'' for their former agencies to restore them. A few agencies askedfor further guidance as to the specific circumstances which would permitan agency to claim it was not feasible to restore such an individual. Giventhe many differences in agencies and individual employee circumstances,we believe it would be virtually impossible and counterproductive to attemptto define this further in a way that would cover all eventualities. Webelieve this is best left to individual determinations. In general, however,it is intended that the agency must have exhausted all efforts to placethe individual before referral to OPM for placement assistance. On thisbasis, we have changed ``not feasible'' to ``not possible.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A few agencies suggested we add a requirement specifically requiringindividuals returning from military duty or injury compensation to requestrestoration in writing and to state that they were requesting restorationunder one of these two laws. This would put their agencies on notice thatspecial treatment was required. We have not adopted this suggestion becausewe believe it is unnecessary and goes beyond the law. Neither of the governingstatutes makes any mention of an employee having to apply for restorationin a certain manner. In essence, this proposal would mainly be for theconvenience of the personnel office_but at the expense of the employee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Several agencies questioned or suggested changes in provisions whichare essentially matters of law. For example, they questioned why an employeeon military duty should be protected from reduction in force and why weneed a provision protecting the vacation privileges of employees on a leaveof absence to perform military duty. These provisions are based on 38 U.S.C.2021, </ITAG><T3>et seq</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="15">_One agency felt strongly that we were going too far in giving employeesabsent because of military duty or compensable injury, the right to beconsidered automatically for all promotions. The agency pointed out thatthis places an enormous burden on the agency and rarely, if ever, resultsin a promotion for the employee. We have taken a closer look at this andagree with the agency. Accordingly, we have modified this section to </ITAG><T3>require </T3>automatic promotion consideration only when an employeeis in a career ladder, in an apprenticeship program, or when his or herposition is reclassified at a higher grade. <ITAG tagnum="15">_One agency suggested we clarify at what point an employee on thereemployment priority list is entitled to be considered outside the commutingarea. Rather than regulate this issue, we prefer to leave these decisionsto individual agencies, based on the circumstances in each case. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_One agency and a union believe we were diminishing the restorationrights of individuals returning from military duty by not giving them mandatoryrights to the positions they left. Actually, this would go beyond the law.The law provides restoration rights only to the position the employee left</ITAG><T3>or an equivalent one</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="15">_One agency opposed the extension of appeal rights that allows partiallyrecovered employees to appeal failure to credit time spent on compensationfor purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service, e.g.,within grade increases. We believe, however, that 5 U.S.C. 8151 clearlyreflects Congress' intent that time spent on compensation be credited forall purposes based on length of service_including within-grade increases.In this connection, the law makes no distinction between partially andfully recovered employees; it merely says that upon reemployment, the employeeshall be entitled to all rights and benefits based upon length of service,including within-grade increases. Accordingly, a limited appeal right isappropriate to ensure that the law is given effect. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_One organization asked that, to avoid confusion, we delete referencesto restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. 3551 because this section is out-of-dateand duplicates restoration rights in Title 38, United States Code. We havedone so.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_One union asked that we include references to employee grievancerights under negotiated grievance procedures. We have done so. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_One organization and a union questioned the definition of ``equivalentposition.'' We have deleted this definition because of the broad rangeof positions in the Federal service and the difficulty of arriving at adefinition which accurately encompasses all possibilities. We believe thedetermination of what constitutes an equivalent position is best left toindividual judgments based on the particular circumstances in each case.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined by section 1(b)of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it pertains only to internalFederal personnel matters. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 353 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees. <ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending Part 353 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations,as follows: 1.
