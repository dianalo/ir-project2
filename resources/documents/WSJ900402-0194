It could happen. Investors don't expect all of the firstquarter's winning industry groups to be still flying high atyear end. The ideal portfolio in the just-ended quarter wasfull of growth stocks and some shares of companies whosefortunes swing with the economy; stocks sensitive to interestrates were notable by their absence.</LP><TEXT>   But things change, and the transformation from dream tonightmare could begin this quarter. Economic-cycle stockscould be vulnerable the rest of this year, some analysts say,while certain financial stocks could rebound.   Few forecasters are predicting a recession this year,though the sharp rise in interest rates during the firstquarter could slow domestic demand. Exports also could slowbecause the dollar has strengthened.   &quot;Sales and inflation figures are going to start tomoderate,&quot; predicts Michael Strauss, chief economist at UBSSecurities Inc. &quot;Underlying growth in the economy should beweaker in the second quarter.&quot; Overall growth in the secondhalf of the year could be less than 1.5%, says Mr. Strauss,who expects the Federal Reserve to respond to slackeninggrowth by nudging short-term interest rates a bit loweraround mid-year.   Slowing growth could test the courage of investors whohoped that a reacceleration of the economy would continue toboost cyclical shares.   &quot;We think there is enough uncertainty in the economicgrowth outlook that as we move through the year people willlose conviction in cyclicals,&quot; says David Rajala, vicepresident at One Federal Asset Management. &quot;The`safety-first' theme will resurrect itself.&quot;   In the first quarter, &quot;safety&quot; meant growth stocks.Winning industry groups, such as semiconductors and software,are full of companies generating strong earnings because oftheir dominant franchises and unique products.   Air freight was the quarter's hottest industry group witha gain of 19.6%. Federal Express, one stock in that group,advanced 21.8% last quarter, partially due to takeover rumorsbut mainly because of price increases in the freight industrythat promise stronger earnings ahead.   &quot;The swing from price cutting to an environment of priceincreases has put life in these stocks,&quot; says David Guthrie,analyst at Morgan, Keegan andamp; Co.   Storage Technology, the best-performing stock on the NewYork Stock Exchange with a gain of 81.9%, has all thecharacteristics of a first-quarter favorite.   First, the company is slicing debt from its balance sheet.Storage Technology issued six million shares last month tohelp pay down $285 million in high-coupon debt.   Second, the company has a product that makes it dominantin the computer-tape library market, says Mark Morris,analyst at Hanifen, Imhoff Inc. &quot;They own the tape librarymarket with no real competitor,&quot; he adds.   And, Storage Technology's earnings could grow 32% thisyear to $1.86 a share, Mr. Morris estimates, an increase inline with proven growth stocks.   EMC Corp., the No. 2 gainer on the Big Board, has a strongalliance with Storage Technology. But the maker of computermemory products also has other hallmarks of a first-quarterwinner, such as a broad, diversified customer base and aniche product. Moreover, Richard Egan, chief executiveofficer, says EMC finished the quarter with little debt and alot of cash on the balance sheet.   Investors choosing among the cyclical stocks looked forcompanies that had dominant positions in their industry.Fluor, a part of the heavy-construction industry group, whichrose 13.2% for a No.3-ranked increase, is a world-wide leaderin engineering and construction. Its shares rose 16.3% in thequarter.   Stocks in the construction, heavy machinery, industrialtechnology and factory-equipment industry groups alsobenefited during the quarter from perceptions of higherinvestment in factory and infrastructure rebuilding in theU.S. and around the world. The rise in these shares reflects&quot;a shift in the economy to capital spending&quot; and away frommilitary spending and consumption, says Alan Dorsey, analystat Dillon Read.   Some analysts say the direction of interest rates willtell the stock market's story at the end of 1990. Theirnear-term bet is that short-term rates will fall a bit whilelong-term rates stay where they are or even rise. If thathappens, many of the shares of well-run savings-and-loanassociations and financing companies that can buy moneycheaply and lend it more expensively could benefit, accordingto Nancy Spady, analyst at Morgan Stanley.   But investors should venture cautiously into thriftstocks, Ms. Spady says. &quot;You really want to focus on thesingle-family housing lenders,&quot; she says. She is recommendingthree: H.F. Ahmanson, Great Western Financial and Golden WestFinancial.   Poor first-quarter performers included banks with suspectloan portfolios, insurance companies with suspect bondportfolios and highly leveraged companies of any type. Butsome good companies were tarred, and investors are beginningto differentiate the good financial stocks from the bad.   &quot;We have begun to purchase selected insurance stocks suchas General Re and Chubb,&quot; says William Kufta, senior vicepresident at Pitcairn Financial Management. Mr. Kufta also is&quot;looking for values&quot; and preparing to buy bank stocks. &quot;We'redoing our best to identify the true risks in loanportfolios,&quot; he adds.   In another category, Joseph McAlinden, director ofresearch at Dillon Read, thinks basic materials stocks willoutperform the market in the months ahead. Last quarter, thebasic materials sector, which includes companies such asAluminum Co. of America and Union Carbide, lagged behind theDow Jones Equity Market Index of 704 stocks.   &quot;Companies that are sensitive to GNP {gross nationalproduct, or a nation's total value of goods and services} canbe risky as we go into the second quarter,&quot; Mr. McAlindenconcedes. But he argues that companies have just about workedoff once-bloated raw materials inventories. Soon, they willgo back out into the market and start bidding up prices forcopper, aluminum and other essential industrial commodities,he says.   &quot;You want to be emphasizing the materials companies now,&quot;he says, adding: &quot;Amax in the aluminum stocks, and copperstocks such as Phelps Dodge.&quot;   What about the dollar's recent strength? Won't that makeU.S. basic materials producers less competitive?   &quot;It's not that you have had a strong dollar but a weakyen,&quot; he says. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar isnot significantly higher, he asserts.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Stocks closed lower and ended the first quarter with thelightest weekly volume in three months. The Dow JonesIndustrial Average fell 20.49 to 2707.21.   End-of-quarter buying from institutions seeking to roundout portfolios before reporting to clients wasn't sufficientto offset the influence of a weak bond market and rounds offutures-related sell programs. Broader market measures, whichlagged the Dow industrials through the quarter, didn't movedown as sharply Friday.

Motorola retreated 2 1/2 to 65 as 1.4 million shareschanged hands. The company was ordered to halt sales of oneof its biggest-selling chips as part of a judge's ruling inits dispute with Hitachi over patent rights, which ended in adraw. Hitachi lost 3 3/4 to 98 3/4; stocks of other Japanesecompanies traded in the U.S. also fell in the wake of aselloff on the Tokyo stock market.   L.A.

Another targetof takeover rumors, Armstrong World Industries, lost 1 1/8 to33 1/8.   Lockheed dropped 5/8 to 36 after claiming victory in itsproxy fight with Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons. Thecompany granted last-minute concessions in an effort toattract the vote of major shareholders.
