For centuries, Hungarians, Romanians and Germans fought over andsettled the historic region of Transylvania. They developed a richculture and a tradition so intertwined that no part of Transylvaniaseems exclusively characteristic of one nationality.   But since the mid-1980s, this cultural blend has been upset byan escalating war of words between Romania and Hungary, which havelong contested each other's claims to Transylvania.   The Hungarian government charges that Romania is discriminatingagainst 2 million ethnic Hungarians by de-emphasizing the Hungarianlanguage in education, diluting Hungarian culture by moving moreRomanians into traditional Hungarian areas and sending Hungariansto work in Romanian areas.   Similar actions are being taken against Transylvania's 220,000ethnic Germans, but the Germans have been emigrtating to WestGermany at a rapid rate.   Since April, official publications in the Hungarian and Germanlanguages have been allowed to use only Romanian versions of placenames. Reports also are circulating that Romanian authorities nolonger are registering typical Hungarian names for Hungarian babiesand that this could also lead to the banning of Hungarian familynames.   Many street signs in Cluj are still in both Hungarian andRomanian, but in Tirgu Mures, a town that is 50 percent Hungarian40 miles to the east, the signs are only in Romanian.   Hungarian is spoken openly in the region, however. In Cluj,where about 35 to 40 percent of the population is Hungarian, RomanCatholic Mass is celebrated daily in Hungarian.   But the Hungarians are not allowed to subscribe to publicationsfrom Hungary.   Five years ago, Cluj's university offered instruction inHungarian and Romanian, but today Hungarian is used only in onecourse, Hungarian philology, which has just five students.   The German minority has been decreasing steadily for years,dropping from 800,000 in 1939 to some 220,000 today.   Ethnic German emigration to West Germany is so rapid that onesmall church has seen its parishioners decline from 2,000 to justover 300 in seven years.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 22</NOTE></DOC>
