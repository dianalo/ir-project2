After Ramsay's return to the British Embassy, in the Christiansector of the divided capital, an embassy official said, ``We haveno additional information.''   Asked whether a hostage release was expected, he said, ``All Ican tell you is that we're not on alert.'' The official spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Earlier, when asked by telephone if his trip was linked to thepress reports, Ramsay said from the British consular office in theMoslem sector: ``I often come to west Beirut and there's nothingsignificant in my current visit.''   An embassy spokesman had said the purpose of Ramsay's journey wasto check the reports.   The British Embassy and Ramsay's residence are in east Beirut.Most hostages are believed held in west Beirut's Shiite Moslem slums.   The reports said kidnapped British journalist John McCarthy andteacher Brian Keenan, who has Irish and British citizenship, couldbe freed within days.   Patrick McCabe, who is Ireland's ambassador to Lebanon but isbased in Iraq, said he would fly to Beirut immediately toinvestigate.   McCarthy and Keenan are among 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon,who include two more Britons and nine Americans. Held longest isTerry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, who was abducted March 16, 1985.   One of the other Britons is Terry Waite, a Church of Englandenvoy who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beiruthotel to negotiate with people holding American hostages.   Most of the foreigners are believed to be captives of Shiiteextremists loyal to Iran, but no faction has claimed to hold Waiteor McCarthy and Keenan, who were seized in April 1986.   Reports of the possible release came from the Voice of Lebanon, aChristian radio station, and Al-Hayat, an Arabic-language newspaperpublished in London. The paper spoke of ``discussions under waybetween Iran and countries involved'' about freeing Keenan andMcCarthy.   Ramsay said in the telephone interview none of the reports orattendant rumors ``can be verified. ... I'm anxious to avoidspeculation on that subject.''   Earlier, the embassy spokesman said: ``We have heard a report andwe're making enquiries.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.   McCarthy, 31, a producer for London-based Worldwide Televisionnews, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove to the airport tocatch a flight home. Keenan, 38, of Belfast, Northern Ireland, anEnglish language teacher at the American University of Beirut, wasseized six days earlier in west Beirut.   McCabe, the Irish ambassador, said he was visiting Lebanon ``toinvestigate a rumor'' circulated Wednesday in Baghdad that the twomen would be freed within 72 hours, but that he had no specificinformation.   ``Is there something hard behind the rumor?'' he said. ``I don'tknow. ... I am always skeptical about the rumor-mill in Beirut.''   Sources in Belfast said privately the British Foreign Office toldKeenan's family there were hopes for ``good news'' soon. His twosisters were said to be planning a trip to Beirut.   Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan of Ireland met with his Iraniancounterpart Ali Akbar Velayati in Paris this month during aninternational conference. Declan Connolly, who is Irish ambassadorto Syria from his base in Saudi Arabia, met with the Syrian foreignminister, Farouk al-Sharaa, on Wednesday in Damascus.   On Thursday, Connolly said he had heard the hostage reports butwas in Syria on a routine visit.   Syria has about 40,000 soldiers stationed in Lebanon and is thecountry's main power broker. It also supported Iran in the war withIraq, in which a cease-fire was reached in August.   Relations have improved between Britain and Iran, which restoredfull diplomatic relations in November after a break of 17 months.Nicholas Nicola, a 23-year-old Briton held in Iran for two yearsafter a shooting incident, was freed earlier this month.   Iran's official news agency quoted Interior Minister Ali AkbarMohatashami on Thursday, however, as saying British businessmanRoger Cooper would be punished according to Islamic law. Cooper hasbeen in jail since 1986 on espionage charges.</TEXT></DOC>
