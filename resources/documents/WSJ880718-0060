A giant bank, once rumored to be failing, suddenly flourishes. Record profits are expected within three years of record losses. A billion in bad loans evaporates in a year. The stock, long shunned by investors, doubles in six months.    And all of this is orchestrated by defectors from a rival bank and an executive who, many say, initially caused the mess.    Yes, a strange thing is happening at BankAmerica Corp.: It is recovering.    For three years running, it was the banking industry's version of The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. BankAmerica chalked up more loan losses than any other American bank, living or dead. Along the way to disaster, it alienated employees, customers, investors and regulators with predictions of imminent recovery that were persistently proved wrong.    This time, it may be right. Signs of progress seem unmistakable. This year, with any luck at all, BankAmerica will report its first profit since 1984. Next year, shareholders could be banking their first dividends since 1985. By 1990, Chairman A.W. &quot;Tom&quot; Clausen says, the company may well post a record pretax profit exceeding $1 billion -- about as much as its 1987 loss. And, as he told the annual meeting in May, &quot;We are not shoveling a lot of B.S.&quot;    But the gains have come at the cost of sweeping, painful moves permanently changing the bank. These days, it almost flaunts spartan attitudes and firings; until two years ago, it took pride in never laying off anyone. Morale has further slumped because the turnaround is being led by former officers of BankAmerica's arch-rival, Wells Fargo andamp; Co., an unsentimental crowd that signed on for various reasons and shows no compunction about purging old-timers.    Even if the recovery continues, most observers doubt that BankAmerica will ever again be a global power. Since 1983, in an incredible vanishing act, it has dropped $27 billion in assets (to $94.3 billion), gutted much of a once-expansive foreign network and retreated to its home turf in California.    Further dismantling, and perhaps a takeover, can't be ruled out. The bank's stock, despite doubling since January, still trades below book value, and the longer it lags behind the improving performance, the more vulnerable BankAmerica becomes to a raider. By 1991, California will permit its banks to be acquired by New York institutions, a change that last year could have greatly escalated a takeover fight with First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles. Though discerning no current takeover threat, BankAmerica officials are considering further major restructuring, such as a joint venture of its remaining international operations, if profit again falls short of predictions.    Some people do wonder whether Mr. Clausen is being overoptimistic. BankAmerica is still far from healthy. It has the highest percentage of nonperforming loans of any major bank outside Texas -- a hazard if a recession hits any time soon. Despite the restructuring, it remains inefficient compared with its peers. And among the top 25 banks, it ranks 24th in capital strength -- curbing its ability to increase profits through asset growth. It thus may never recoup the huge market share it surrendered to its California competitors.    Some of its recent earnings gains may also reflect aggressive accounting maneuvers, which Mr. Clausen also used in the late 1970s. BankAmerica has virtually stopped recognizing foreign-loan losses in the past 18 months despite a surge in foreign nonperforming loans -- loans for which payments are 90 days past due or that seem unlikely to be repaid in full. Its foreign-loan reserves are, on a percentage basis, about $2 billion less than those of other big California banks. That, if recognized on its books, would delay the profit turnaround for several years.    &quot;In due course, the corporation will recover to become a mediocre business,&quot; concludes Alan Hoefer, a San Francisco investment banker. &quot;Meanwhile, it will surely tempt the speculators in turnarounds.&quot;    John Poelker, a former BankAmerica chief financial officer, sees further shrinkage, absent a takeover. &quot;The long-term future is of a much smaller and more regional institution,&quot; he says.    Twenty-two months ago, however, BankAmerica looked as if it might not have a future at all. On Sept. 16, 1986, rumors that it would fail roared out of Europe, depressing the dollar and scaring away some corporate deposits. The bank didn't collapse, but the five-year reign of Samuel H. Armacost as its chief executive did. A month later, the board summoned back his predecessor, Mr. Clausen, who had recently retired as the World Bank's president. The step was extraordinary: Mr. Clausen had led BankAmerica's plunge into international lending and other risky ventures that helped cause the huge loan losses that unseated Mr. Armacost.    The two chief executives could hardly differ more. &quot;Sam was perhaps a little too benevolent to make the tough decisions,&quot; Alfred Grove, a senior energy lending officer, says in vast understatement. &quot;Tom has never been an indecisive guy.&quot;    Mr. Clausen is all business, coldly analytical and demanding, someone better at recalling abstruse financial ratios than his own home phone number, which he keeps written down at his desk. Admirers say he brought stability and discipline, exactly what the then-teetering giant needed. He fired two executive vice presidents for bungling a computer project. To plug press leaks, he abolished a management forum that Mr. Armacost had viewed as an exercise in corporate democracy.    By last April, when Mr. Clausen took his first week off, his fast pace had scared off his first administrative assistant and run others ragged. &quot;The man has an iron will,&quot; says an official once stranded with him in a three-hour reception line at a convention -- without a bathroom break.    But some say the 65-year-old executive, like his wine collection, has mellowed with age. Since returning to BankAmerica, he has sent personal notes to secretaries who bring in new customers. He now spends more time than he used to cajoling old customers and less running daily operations. His speech writer has been caught buying jokes.    &quot;I am the nicest guy I know,&quot; he says in an interview.    He also has people to do the dirty work. The former Wells Fargo executives who dominate the managing committee and hold other key posts are a tough bunch. Wells Fargo has become the most profitable big bank in the West with a ruthless operating style, a sharp contrast with BankAmerica's history of paternalism.    Take BankAmerica's newly appointed executive vice president and branch chief, Thomas Peterson. His predecessor, who now runs charitable giving, inspired the troops with rainbow lapel pins. Mr. Peterson phoned one senior aide and introduced himself in this manner: &quot;This is Tom Peterson. Why the hell are you opening a branch in Santa Cruz? Meet me in Santa Cruz tomorrow morning at 7:30.&quot;    The influx from Wells Fargo is upsetting some once-senior BankAmerica officials, who are either leaving or slipping into reduced roles. An employee-morale survey shows a rise among the rank and file but a decline among middle managers. But given BankAmerica's recent track record, &quot;you don't necessarily want stability,&quot; says Allen Sanborn, a longtime executive vice president. &quot;The reality is, these guys know how to make a buck. I view them as positive and needed.&quot;    A Wells alumnus will almost certainly succeed Mr. Clausen in a year or two. The clear leader is Richard Rosenberg, the 58-year-old California-banking chief. His main competitors: two of his former Wells colleagues, Frank Newman, the respected chief financial officer, and Lewis Coleman, the fast-rising vice chairman for corporate and international affairs. At age 46, each could well become candidates for the top job later if Mr. Rosenberg wins out.    Together, the new team is toughening up the place. Some 5,000 jobs are being cut this year, on top of 27,000 since 1983. The bank used to give &quot;redeployed&quot; workers a month to find other jobs internally. Now, with the pickings so slim, they get just two weeks. Those remaining are treated more like renewable commodities than coddled &quot;boys and girls,&quot; as A.P. Giannini, the bank's founder, called them.    &quot;I come from a place that was very, very efficient,&quot; Mr. Peterson says, &quot;and we're going to do the same thing here.&quot;    In the 862 branches, the corporate crown jewels, he has frozen most managers' base salaries and linked all future increases to performance. He is making most teller jobs part-time, slashing hours and benefits. Customers are also feeling a squeeze. A Marin County branch, for instance, has stopped cashing in foreign currencies for dollars for free. &quot;We had a tendency to give things away,&quot; Mr. Peterson says. &quot;We can't do that anymore.&quot;    For the first time in years, the company is adding more checking accounts than it is losing. Auto and residential-mortgage loans are surging. Costs as a percentage of revenue have been falling for a year, indicating improved operating efficiency. The gains show that the bank retains a strong following among individual depositors; many are shareholders.    Last year, an internal survey found, the bank's own financial condition played a role in some 70% of the cases in which it was outbid for U.S. corporate work. Now, the bank sees rapid improvement. &quot;You don't spend the first 10 minutes defending yourself,&quot; a loan officer says. &quot;People don't want to hear about the bank anymore.&quot; Its North American division expects its new corporate loans to increase about $1 billion, or 10%, this year.    That gain pales, however, beside the turnaround in credit losses -- even allowing for aggressive accounting. For five years, BankAmerica has been banking's biggest bleeder, suffering $5.48 billion in credit losses. A year ago, its loan losses as a percentage of total loans were twice the industry average; today, they are about half the average. First-quarter charge-offs fell to $92 million from $315 million a year earlier.    Potential losses also are shrinking fast. Slow-paying U.S. loans declined 38% in the past year. Real estate accounts for 52% of them, but the exposure in Texas, once the worst area, is down to about $60 million from $500 million three years ago.    Even in the Third World, the bank is making progress. Depending on several factors, the recent debt accord with Brazil could double BankAmerica's earnings this year, estimates Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a bank-securities firm in New York.    &quot;We have scrubbed the portfolio,&quot; says Vice Chairman Glenhall Taylor, the credit chief and another Wells Fargo alumnus.    BankAmerica officials have made confident statements before -- only to soon announce more trouble. But the company has never had a credit chief like Mr. Taylor, who was appointed in September 1985 with the backing of federal regulators. Under Mr. Taylor, loan officers find sweeter rewards for reducing problem loans than seeking new business. Shaky loans are written off much earlier. Five years ago, BankAmerica was counting as income the interest on $1 billion of loans three months past due; that has shrunk to about $170 million. However, former loan officers and customers complain that the process of approving new loans or collecting on bad ones has become too impersonal.    Ironically, much of the drop in credit losses reflects large recoveries of previously charged-off loans. That is due to more-aggressive loan-workout policies. But it also suggests that Mr. Armacost, the former chief, charged off too many loans -- helping Mr. Clausen, whose policies in the 1970s had hurt Mr. Armacost.    In many ways, BankAmerica's real challenge is just beginning. The bank still spends about 10 cents more than its peers to produce a dollar of revenue. To wipe out that competitive handicap, it must cut as much as $500 million more in annual expenses -- equivalent to another 15,000 jobs -- or drum up a lot of new business. And that's hard. The bank's market share has been eroded by financial difficulties, employee turnover and sheer incompetence. Despite improving customer relations, hard feelings persist.    &quot;We have to re-enter the marketplace,&quot; concedes Thomas Decker, the executive vice president for commercial lending. In the so-called middle market, the bank has ceded much of its former dominance to Wells Fargo and aggressive independent banks. BankAmerica's U.S. commercial and industrial loans have shrunk 25% since 1984; Wells Fargo has doubled its share, and now the two are in a dead heat.    Moreover, BankAmerica's treatment of foreign loans is still suspect. It took $1.17 billion of losses on such loans in 1985 and 1986, but only $9 million in 1987 and $15 million so far this year. Meanwhile, the nonperforming total ballooned to $2.47 billion at last Dec. 31 from $1.42 billion at the end of 1985. The same loans to Third World governments that BankAmerica carries on its books at full value are being sold by some regional banks at discounts of 50% and more. &quot;The disparity is preposterous,&quot; says Mr. Hoefer, the investment banker.    BankAmerica contends that the big drop in foreign losses reflects previous conservatism rather than liberal accounting. It also notes that its foreign reserves, though lower than those of its California rivals, match levels at New York banks.    BankAmerica officials hope that, like the earlier problems, the improving finances will feed on themselves. It is counting on a stronger credit rating to allow it to become more than a minor leaguer in pitching lucrative interest-rate and currency swaps. Money to promote a flagging global corporate computer service is becoming available. So is support for a beefed-up team of deal makers to broker mergers among California companies. None of these areas, however, hold the prospect of quick growth.    &quot;It is a far better bank than a year ago, but we have not recovered,&quot; Mr. Clausen concedes. &quot;We have not completed the agenda.&quot; Part of that agenda is to restore the dividend, and Mr. Clausen may hope to announce that at the annual meeting next spring, possibly as a high note in his swan song. In addition, Mr. Clausen vigorously rebuts charges that his policies in the 1970s caused all the havoc. But some people wonder whether he sees an opportunity to refute that, once and for all.    &quot;He can rewrite the first draft of his life,&quot; a former aide says. &quot;Not many of us get that chance.&quot;    ---               BankAmerica's Painful Recovery   All figures in millions of dollars, except stock prices   Sharply reduced loan losses finally help BankAmerica return to the black and lift its stock . . .
