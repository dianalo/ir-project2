John Feren, vice president of marketing for the DouglasAircraft operation here, said a four-engine version was addedlate last year to other potential models featuring thetrademark three-engine approach to its big long-range planes.That addition came after &quot;we didn't seem to have the criticalenthusiasm that would drive people to make a decisionpromptly,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   The four-engine design -- more closely resembling thepopular 747 jetliner family offered by rival Boeing Co. --was presented to Delta Air Lines and the American Airlinesunit of AMR Corp., spokesmen for those carriers confirmed.Other possible buyers include Japan Air Lines, SingaporeAirlines, Swissair and Federal Express Corp.   McDonnell Douglas's indecision over basic design suggeststo some analysts that the project -- which it has said isnecessary to its survival in commercial aircraft building --may be foundering. It also suggests that, because afour-engine plane could be far more expensive to develop,costs could rise sharply. That possibility could put morepressure on Taiwan investors, who have preliminarily agreedto a $2 billion equity infusion into the airliner operationsfor the purpose of developing the new plane.   The new design apparently has the added advantage ofletting McDonnell Douglas into the wave of super-sizedairliners being reviewed by Boeing and Airbus Industrie as away to carry 600 passengers. McDonnell Douglas has said theMD-12 basically is being built to seat more than 400passengers, although the option it is discussing of adding asecond tier of seats could allow much greater capacity.   In an interview, Mr. Feren said that in all potentialdesigns, the company has &quot;preserved&quot; the option of seatingfor up to 600 passengers and flying them 8,000 nauticalmiles.   McDonnell Douglas has said that it needs a bigger,longer-range jetliner to add to its line of MD-11 wide-bodyaircraft and MD-80 narrow-body jets. If it decides to goahead, it would produce the MD-12 by 1997, although it hasn'tsaid how much the plane might cost.   A discussion of the company's latest design options firstappeared in this week's Aviation Week magazine.   Company officials have said they expect to settle on a newdesign by early May. Robert Hood Jr., president of theDouglas Aircraft unit, said last week that some potentialairline customers are expected to review the final design inabout six weeks.   But some aerospace analysts suggest that any major designchanges now would signal to many that the MD-12 is falteringat an inopportune time. &quot;It appears as if McDonnell Douglasdoesn't know what the MD-12 really is,&quot; said Phil Friedman ofMorgan Stanley andamp; Co. Paul Nisbet of Prudential SecuritiesInc. said an altered design approach could add $1 billion tothe development cost.   Mr. Feren, however, said some added cost could be offsetby savings from not having to accommodate the costly featureof an engine in the tail of the new jet to go with twounder-wing engines.   McDonnell Douglas officials have estimated the MD-12 willcost $4 billion to $5 billion to produce. Boeing has citedother estimates that the real cost to Douglas in negativecash flow will be closer to $10 billion.   Mr. Nisbet said that the recent addition of a designoption implies that the company's deal to secure $2 billionin equity from Taiwan Aerospace Corp. is far from secure.Analysts have speculated lately that McDonnell Douglas's planfor financing development of the aircraft is in trouble onboth sides of the Pacific. In return for the investment, theTaiwan company would build wings and fuselages for the MD-12,and would own up to 40% of all McDonnell Douglas'scommercial-aircraft operations. The proposed deal, whichfaces strong opposition from some elected officals in Taiwan,is being questioned in congressional hearings and by Boeing.   &quot;I think it's definitely up in the air, or there wouldn'tbe uncertainty as to the configuration,&quot; Mr. Nisbet said.</TEXT></DOC>
