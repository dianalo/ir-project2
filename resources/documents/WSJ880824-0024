The latest consumer price rise, which some economists called modest, joins other indicators that show clear increases in the inflation rate last month. In recent weeks, producer prices and wage increases for July showed solid gains.    Although the 0.4% increase isn't as high as the 0.6% increase in producer prices for July, economists said it doesn't relieve worries about a pickup in inflation.    In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that new orders for durable goods, those intended to last three years or more, declined 7% in July after an 8.7% increase the month before.    The July increase in consumer prices is higher than the 0.3% increases in each of the preceding two months. Excluding the often volatile food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose 0.3% in July after a 0.4% rise the month before.    &quot;This is a tranquil number . . . but the problem with inflation is not that it is breaking out now, but that it is likely to accelerate in the future,&quot; Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said.    The sharp increase in grocery store prices, the biggest monthly increase since January 1984, pushed food and beverage prices up 0.9%. Food prices rose 0.6% in June. These price increases reflect the effects of the drought to some extent, the Labor Department said. However, there have been some indications that vendors are raising their prices in anticipation of higher food costs.    Fruit and vegetables prices rose 4.7% in July, compared with a 0.3% increase the month before. Poultry and egg prices increased, but a drop in pork prices pushed down overall meat prices. Economists said food prices will continue increasing through the first quarter of 1989.    These increases were offset by a decline of 0.6% in apparel prices, the second consecutive decline. Apparel prices rose sharply earlier this year. The recent declines reflect end-of-season reductions, and the American Apparel Manufacturers Association said it expects the new fall and back-to-school stocks to push up apparel prices in the coming months.    Joel Popkin, a private economist in Washington, said he expects prices generally &quot;are going to increase by at least 0.4% and 0.5% (a month) as the new seasonal goods come into the market.&quot;    Gasoline prices rose 0.7%, pushing the transportation index up 0.4% in July. Increases were also recorded for shelter, medical care and education costs. Energy prices rose 0.3% after a decline of 0.2% the preceding month.    Consumer prices increased at a 5.2% annual rate in July. Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index rose 0.4% and is 4.1% higher than a year earlier.    The Commerce Department said both the July decline and the June increase in orders for durable goods were strongly influenced by orders for military and transportation goods. Orders totaled $116.6 billion in July. Excluding transportation, orders fell 0.9% in July after an increase of 0.7% in June.    New orders for transportation equipment declined 21.2% in July, offsetting much of the 33.3% increase in June. The department said that apart from increases in commercial aircraft and parts, all other categories in transportation decreased in July.    Orders for the closely watched non-defense capital-goods sector fell 0.1% in July after a 12.4% rise the month before. Nondefense orders are regarded as a barometer of business investment.    Despite this slight drop, economists were optimistic on the level of business investment. &quot;These numbers are very erratic because of the transportation equipment,&quot; said Mr. Gramley, &quot;but export orders and strong domestic capital spending are still strong, so they will drive new capital goods orders up.&quot;    Defense orders dropped 43.9% to $6.1 billion after a 68.7% increase in June. Shipbuilding and tanks were instrumental in the movements in new orders for both months.    Unfilled orders rose 0.8% to $3.2 billion, with the increase mostly in commercial aircraft and parts. This increase follows a 2.2% rise in June. Shipments of durable goods declined 2.6% in July to $3.1 billion, after an increase of 1.5% the month before.    The department's report on durable goods is frequently revised. The June increase, initially estimated at 8.8%, was later revised to 9.4%. The department yesterday revised the June estimate again, to an increase of 8.7%. The figures in this report are adjusted for seasonal variations but not inflation.    In another report, the Labor Department said average weekly earnings of U.S. workers increased a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in July after adjusting for inflation. The increase came from a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings and a 0.6% rise in hours worked.    Weekly earnings for workers averaged $325.27 after seasonal adjustments but not inflation, compared with $322.02 in June. Before adjustment, average weekly earnings were $324.68, compared with $311.50 in July 1987.    Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for July.                                        % change from                                     June         July                                     1988         1987    All items ....................... 0.4         4.1      Minus food andamp; energy ........... 0.3         4.5    Food and beverage ............... 0.9         4.5    Housing ......................... 0.3         3.8    Apparel ........................ -0.6         5.0    Transportation .................. 0.4         2.7    Medical care .................... 0.7         6.6    Entertainment ................... 0.3         4.4    Other ........................... 0.9         6.6   July consumer price indexes (1982-1984 equals 100), before adjustment for seasonal variation, together with the percentage increases from July 1987 were:    All urban consumers ............. 118.5       4.1    Urban wage earners andamp; clerical ... 117.2       4.0    Chicago ......................... 119.8       3.4    Los Angeles ..................... 122.1       4.8    New York ........................ 123.6       4.8    Philadelphia .................... 123.2       4.9    San Francisco ................... 120.9       4.4    Baltimore ....................... 119.9       4.3    Boston .......................... 123.8       6.4    Cleveland ....................... 117.6       4.3    Miami ........................... 116.8       4.3    St. Louis ....................... 116.0       2.9    Washington, D.C. ................ 120.7       3.9</TEXT></DOC>
