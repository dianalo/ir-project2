It must say something sensible.   That is how we read the flap over a draft Pentagonstrategy for U.S. defense policy after the Cold War. Havingignored Defense Secretary Cheney's testimony on Capitol Hill,the critics get frantic over a draft that hadn't yet clearedthe second rungs at Defense but was leaked to the press. Yetthe draft said little different from what Mr. Cheney hasalready said many times.</LP><TEXT>   His strategy is to keep the United States militarilypre-eminent, even as defense spending falls from its Cold Warheights. The goal is to remain strong enough, andsufficiently engaged in the world, so that no other nationwill want to emerge as a new global threat as the SovietUnion did after World War II. This also means retaining theability to project military force to put down the world'srogues and pirates.   The strategy's premise is that history hasn't ended, aseach week proves again. North Korea is building nuclearweapons and arming the mullahs in Tehran. Saddam Husseinpersists, and China keeps exporting missile technology toSecretary of State Baker's favorite peacemaker, Assad ofSyria. The former Soviet Union may be years away fromstability.   And these are just the dangers we know. The Cheneystrategy understands that preserving the peace also requiresenough force to deter enemies we can't foresee, some of whommay be our friends today. Japan and Germany don't havemilitary ambitions now, in large part because they feelconfident about America's ability to come to their defense.If the U.S. retreats too far from the world, their anxietywill increase until they feel they must re-arm.   Yet the same Americans who quake in fear of Japanese VCRssomehow don't seem to mind the prospect of a nuclear-armedJapan. Mr. Buchanan, who used to be a hawk, calls thePentagon strategy &quot;a formula for endless Americanintervention in quarrels and war,&quot; a &quot;blank check given toall of America's friends and allies that we'll go to war todefend their interests.&quot; Senator Biden, Mr. Buchanan's newstrategic soul mate, calls it the &quot;old notion of the UnitedStates as the world's policeman.&quot;   This fear of endless U.S. intervention is an oldisolationist chestnut; it will certainly come as a surpriseto the Croats who got barely a nod from the U.S. when theywere attacked by Serbs last year. Filipinos watching the U.S.pull out of Subic Bay may also have their doubts. In fact,the Pentagon's real point is to give a U.S. President theoption to use force to protect vital interests, or tosuppress the new form of piracy that is nuclearproliferation. The point is to spend enough on defense now sowe don't have to spend much, much more in a new arms racelater.   The Cheney strategy may be the biggest bargain in history.By 1997 his budget would cost about 3.4% of GDP; that's lowerthan before Pearl Harbor and less than half what the U.S.spent in the booming economy of the 1950s and 1960s.Discounting for congressional pork and waste, it isn't toomuch more than Japan already spends now.   And anyway, what is the Buchanan-Biden alternative? Mr.Biden favors &quot;the next big advance in civilization,&quot; namelythe utopia of &quot;collective power through the United Nations.&quot;We agree the U.N. can play a more constructive role now thatSoviet communism has collapsed, but do Americans really wantto trust their security to a global committee? Does anyonethink the U.N. would have lifted a finger against SaddamHussein without the prodding of George Bush? As for Mr.Buchanan, his alternative seems to be Fortress America, whoseresults we saw in the 1930s.   In the real world, the likeliest strategic alternative toPax Americana is a form of balance of power. Insecureregional powers will respond to U.S. retreat by arming to theteeth, causing their neighbors to do the same; the U.S. willend up playing one against another. In Asia, that would meanplaying China against Japan in their historic rivalry forinfluence in Korea. In Europe, we'd have to balance Germanyagainst Russia; in the Mideast, Iraq against Iran.   This is precisely the policy the U.S. pursued in the 1980sin the Persian Gulf, building up Iraq to balance Iranianpower. Saddam proved to be even more dangerous, as no doubtmany another &quot;ally&quot; would prove to be in a balance-of-powerworld. Yet this is precisely the kind of volatile, unsafeworld Mr. Cheney's critics apparently want us to rush toward.   All of which makes us wonder why President Bush felt hehad to dodge this issue at his press conference last week.We'd have thought that a chance to run against aBiden-Buchanan axis would be too inviting to pass up. If hiscritics really want to make defense a campaign issue, why notoblige them and run as the real America First candidate?</TEXT></DOC>
