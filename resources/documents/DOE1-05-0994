Sevenproblem areas constitute the seven sections of this volume. The firstsection covers selection for strength and toughness, including resistanceto shock loading, or notch toughness. New developments in the HSLA steelfamily are featured; also, a great deal of attention is given to austemperedductile iron. The next section discusses basic information on fatiguemechanisms and prevention of fatigue failures. Wear, one of the greatestcauses of metal deterioration and failure, is dealt with in the thirdsection. A wide range of materials - from carbon steels to superalloys- is covered in the fourth section on selection of materials for elevatedtemperature service. Certain environments which include corrosion alongwith heat, and materials for extended life under these conditions arecovered, as are silicon carbide and developments in PM alloys for hightemperature service. The fifth section deals with alloys for serviceat subzero or cryogenic temperatures. Corrosion, the major natural enemyof the entire metals industry, is discussed in the sixth section. Thefinal section, on special applications, is oriented mainly toward theelectrical industry. Materials for both magnetically soft and permanentmagnet applications are also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
