(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker said Tuesday he isfighting for his life in his defense against a $52 million lawsuitaccusing him, his wife and a former aide of mismanaging theministry he left in disgrace.   Bakker's work for the ministry, with its television programs andHeritage USA religious theme park, was praised in court by a formermember of the PTL board, who said Bakker deserved his high salaryand every bonus he received.   And the evangelist's former financial secretary testified thathe reimbursed the ministry for personal expenses that were paid forout of PTL funds.   During a lunch break at the trial in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,Bakker said of the case, ``It may be business as usual for everyoneelse, but this is my life I'm talking about.'' He called it``literally a trial for my life.''   In the first week of the trial, held last month, PTL's currentmanagers presented testimony and evidence that Bakker receivedmillions of dollars in bonuses and salaries.   The ministry went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, seeking protectionfrom creditors while it reorganized, in June 1987, three monthsafter Bakker resigned in a sex-and-hush-money scandal.   In testimony Tuesday, pastor Evelyn Spencer of The House ofTruth Church in Oakland, Calif., said that she and other PTL boardmembers consistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses forBakker.   ``If a bonus came up, I voted for it,'' said Ms. Spencer, whowas on the board from November 1985 to March 1987, when the boardresigned.   According to IRS figures presented in court, Bakker received$278,000 in salaries in the fiscal year ending in May 1987, plus anadditional $1,167,000 in bonuses in that year.   Bakker was to testify Tuesday but that was postponed a day toallow him time to review canceled checks and reimbursement vouchersthat were supplied to his attorneys Monday.   Bakker said he was ``a touch angry'' that he was only nowreceiving information he needs to defend himself, and hinted atintentional sabotage. ``I think somebody calculated they would holdall the materials until the middle of the trial,'' he said, thoughhe did not say who.   And he predicted his research would satisfy at least 90 percentof the IRS's concerns.   Also testifying Tuesday was independent financial analyst JamesWilson, who said PTL's finances from 1978 to 1986 showed it to be ahealthy, growing ministry without financial problems.   According to Wilson, the ministry's fixed assets grew at anannual compound rate of 28 percent during that time while revenuesincreased 19 percent.   Under cross-examination by PTL attorney Tom White, Ms. Spencercould not recall the precise salary of Bakker during her time onthe board.   ``Everything you can get your hands on would be fair?'' JudgeRufus Reynolds asked Ms. Spencer about Bakker's compensation. Ms.Spencer denied that.   Also testifying was Patricia Harrison, Bakker's former financialsecretary, who said her job was to keep his personal expensesseparate from the ministry's money. She said she routinely wrotereimbursement checks to the ministry for Bakker's expenses.   But she said former Bakker aide David Taggart, also a defendant,frequently received cash advances for himself and Bakker for whichshe never saw documentation. Taggart told her he kept thatdocumentation at home, she said.   An IRS agent also testified he found cash advances to Bakker andTaggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose.</TEXT></DOC>
