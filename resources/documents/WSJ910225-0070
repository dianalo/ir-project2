The WEU, which includes all the EC members except Denmark,Greece and Ireland, endorsed for further talks a report thatwould add institutional muscle to the WEU as the strengthenedEuropean pillar of NATO. The report affirms the need toretain trans-Atlantic defense links. It says that theEuropean Council, the meetings of heads of state andgovernment of the EC countries, should be able to discuss alldefense and security matters, and that its decisions wouldserve as guidelines for the WEU to enact. The WEU wouldremain independent, but consider moving its secretariat toBrussels from London to be closer to EC bodies.   The plan is a compromise on ideas, such as an EC-WEUmerger, for organizing a Pan-European defense policy.   Officials of the WEU said its strengthening within NATOcould include having the WEU increasingly agree on commonEuropean proposals to be brought before the NATO council. TheWEU also could expand its role as a coordinating body forjoint military operations.                                                                                                          MILESTONE FOR BULLET TRAINS                                                                                                          Japan's &quot;bullet train&quot; service, which began operating in1964 to coincide with the Tokyo Olympics, is expected tocarry its three billionth passenger tomorrow. The trains,which can travel at speeds of about 125 miles an hour, havelogged 762.6 million miles, equal to 1,600 round trips to themoon, a Japanese news agency said. The one billion-passengermark was set in 1976 and the two billion level in 1984.                                                                                                          GERMAN RETAILERS WIN WAGE DEAL                                                                                                          The 600,000 employees in small retail outlets in easternGermany, almost all of which have been privatized, will bepaid at 65% of the level for comparable work in westernBerlin, retroactive to Jan. 1. They previously got 55% ofcomparable wages. By year end, the ratio is to rise to 75%.The Union of Public Service, Transport and Traffic Workersalso wants a 65% deal for its 110,000 workers in the five newstates of eastern Germany.                                                                                                          AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND                                                                                                          The 22 member nations of the African Development Fund,which provides loans through the African Development Bank,agreed to commit $3.42 billion to the fund through December1993, adding about $100 million to previous commitments.Contributors are from outside Africa.                                                                                                          CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S PRIVATIZATION                                                                                                          Parliament is expected to vote tomorrow on a landmark billto turn much of Czechoslovak industry over to private hands,a cornerstone of the planned transformation of theinefficient state-controlled economy into one patterned afterthose in the West. Large concerns are to be converted intojoint stock companies, with state-owned shares to be sold inturn to domestic and foreign investors. Separately,Bulgaria's parliament voted to restore farmland to privateowners and end more than 40 years of former ruling Communistmanagement of agriculture, in a bid to overhaul the economy.                                                                                                          HONG KONG EMIGRATION CASE                                                                                                          Lakeview Development of Canada Ltd. and one of itsexecutives were fined 52,000 Hong Kong dollars (US$6,674)total, after pleading guilty to three counts each of sellingunauthorized investments designed to make it easier toemigrate. Regulators could have imposed a HK$500,000 fine oneach count and three years in prison. Limited partnershipssought to raise money to develop property in Canada, with thepromise this would improve an investor's chance of gettingpermission to emigrate there. Hong Kong's effort to protectagainst unscrupulous immigration plans comes as hundreds ofthousands of people seek second passports before 1997, whenthe British colony reverts to China.

Kim Yong Hwan, former chief policy maker for the party,said Kim Young Sam, the party's executive chairman, was oneof the three who signed the report.
