Therefore, FmHA amendsits regulations to require that the County Supervisor or District Directormust review a certification statement with applicants for insured loansand that the applicant must sign and date the certification statement toshow that the applicant is aware of and understands the debt collectionmethods the Federal Government can use in recovering delinquent or defaulteddebt on FmHA loans.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>[53 FR 9318] on March 22, 1988, and invited commentsfor 60 days ending May 23, 1988. Two comments were received from farm organizationsand one from the FmHA Single Family Housing Processing Division (SFHPD).They were concerned that (1) the actual Form FmHA 1910-11 was not publishedin the <T4>Federal Register; </T4>(2) suspension and debarment proceedings werenot listed on the form; and (3) the form does not include borrower rightsor available servicing options.Form FmHA 1910-11 was not published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as a Proposed Rule, however, draft copies ofthe form were available upon request and FmHA did provide these copiesto interested parties in response to requests for the form.Concern also was expressed that Form FmHA 1910-11 did not include debarmentand suspension as available debt collection mechanisms. Since the timethese regulations were published as a Proposed Rule, the Department ofAgriculture issued agency-wide regulations concerning debarment and suspensionat 54 FR 4722 (January 30, 1989). As a result, debarment and suspensionhas been included on Form FmHA 1910-11 as a possible action that may betaken by the Federal Government if loan payments become delinquent or ifthe borrower defaults on the loan.Form FmHA 1910-11 does not list borrower rights or available servicingoptions. These issues are addressed in other FmHA Regulations. The intentof this form is only to ensure that applicants for Federal loans are awareof debt collection methods the Federal Government can use in recoveringdelinquent or defaulted debt on FmHA loans.A minor modification in FmHA instruction 1944-A is made in answer to theSFHPD request.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 1822Loan programs_Housing and community development, Low and moderate incomehousing, Mortgages, Nonprofit organizations, Rural housing.7 CFR Part 1823Credit, Indians.7 CFR Part 1910Applications, Credit, Loan programs_Agriculture, Loan programs_Housingand community development, Low and moderate income housing, Marital statusdiscrimination, Sex discrimination.7 CFR Part 1941Crops, Livestock, Loan programs_Agriculture, Rural areas, Youth.7 CFR Part 1942Community development, Community facilities, Loan programs_Housing andcommunity development, Loan security, Rural areas, Waste treatment anddisposal_Domestic, Water supply_Domestic.7 CFR Part 1943 Credit, Loan programs_Agriculture, Recreation, Water resources. 7 CFR Part 1944 Administrative practice and procedure, Aged, Farm labor housing, Grantprograms_Housing and community development, Handicapped, Home improvement,Loan programs_Housing and community development, Low and moderate incomehousing_Rental, Migrant labor, Mobile homes, Mortgages, Nonprofit organizations,Public housing, Rent subsidies, Rural housing, Subsidies. 7 CFR Part 1945 Agriculture, Disaster assistance, Loan programs_Agriculture. 7 CFR Part 1951 Account servicing, Grant programs_Housing and community development, Reportingrequirements, Rural areas. 7 CFR Part 1955 Government acquired property, Sale of government acquired property, Surplusgovernment property. 7 CFR Part 1965 Administrative practice and procedure, Loan programs_Housing and communitydevelopment, Low and moderate income housing_Rental, Mortgages, Rural areas.Therefore, FmHA amends Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulationsas follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1822_RURAL HOUSING LOANS AND GRANTS </ITAG>1.
