But others, after being briefed by Defense Secretary DickCheney, said they agreed with the administration's caution in theface of weak intelligence flowing in from Panama during theuprising on Tuesday.   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., likened the situation to the failedattempt by exiled Cubans to invade at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, whenU.S. support was withheld at the crucial moment.   ``Why have 12,000 troops in Panama who are highly motivated andtrained, and not use them in either a military or a paramilitarymanner?'' asked Skelton, a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee.   ``We had full knowledge they were going to do this. I'm afraidit's a matter of cold feet,'' Skelton said in an interview. ``Itwas a conscious decision (by Bush) not to assist ... I'm furiousabout it.''   On his way to the briefing, Cheney told reporters theadministration believes Noriega was in the control of the rebelsfor a time, though it had not been clear during the uprising thiswas the case.   ``Clearly they were not of the mind to turn him over to us,''Cheney said.   Noriega is under federal indictment in Florida for drugtrafficking.   Later, after the hour-long Cheney briefing, Skelton said theadministration's doubts weren't sufficient justification forinaction. ``They wanted certainty. Well, you do not get an engravedinvitation to a coup... They just lacked boldness.''   ``We look indecisive, vacillating and weak,'' said Rep. HenryHyde, R-Ill. ``The consequences from this could be profound.''   ``We blew it,'' said Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, thesenior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   ``It's a major setback for our foreign policy. It raisesquestions whether people down there can ever have confidence in theUnited States.''   Broomfield said if the White House had advance knowledge of thecoup plans and had called in senior congressional leaders, theadministration would have found ample support for a limitedmilitary response to the uprising.   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., who attended the closed briefingconducted by Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, for members of the Senate, raised questions aboutthe United States' intelligence capability in Panama.   ``It would appear to me that we would have better intelligencesources in Panama than we have,'' Sasser told reporters. ``The factthat this coup materialized, we don't have notice of it sooner thanwe did, we could not have reacted quicker to it, I think it's someindication that our intelligence sources in Panama are not asadequate as we have a right to expect them to be given our longpresence in that country.''   Asked after the Senate briefing what the coup attempt means forNoriega, Cheney said: ``If I was in General Noriega's shoes, I'd bea very nervous man tonight. Here's a guy whose got to have doubtsgiven the fact that one of his close supporters tried to run a coupon him. That can't give him great confidence about his ownsecurity.''   There were some lawmakers supportive of Bush's decision, as well.   ``The president was absolutely correct,'' said Rep. JosephMcDade, R-Pa. ``We're not an invading force. We'd like to seeGeneral Noriega out, but I support the president in what he did.''   ``They deserve credit for the coolness and calmness theydisplayed under very difficult circumstances,'' said Rep. StephenSolarz, D-N.Y.   Opponents of Bush's inaction were far more vocal.   Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said theadministration apparently has decided on a policy of not usingforce in Panama.   ``Any disturbance like this should have provided the necessarycover and opportunity to move with military force againstNoriega,'' Aspin said. ``We ought to be ready at any opportunity... They did not seize the moment.''   ``This is laissez-faire diplomacy and it's outrageous,'' saidRep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., a member of the House IntelligenceCommittee. He said it would apparently have been relatively easy tosupport the rebels, but the administration ``blinked.''   ``Yesterday makes Jimmy Carter look like a man of resolve.There's a resurgence of the wimp factor,'' McCurdy said.   ``There is a role for force in our foreign policy. Bush wouldhave come off as a hero in America, and probably throughout CentralAmerica. Now, instead, we have a major credibility problem.''   Lack of U.S. support for the rebels makes it even more remotethat any members of the Panamanian military will risk anotheruprising, he said. ``Who's going to volunteer to do this now?''</TEXT></DOC>
