(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Genicom 1040 It's a rare occasion when you can take a printer out of the box,set it up with hardly a glance at the manual, and run it through the entiresuite of PC Labs tests without a problem.andP;  It is rarer still for the sameprinter to produce letter-quality text, crisp graphics, and solid coloroutput--all at reasonable speed and acceptable noise levels.andP;  The $1,92424-pin wide-carriage Genicom 1040 is just such a printer.andM;The 1040 is a letter-quality black-and-white printer with an optional colorcapability.andP;  The black-andwhite version is $1,799, and the color upgrade kitcosts an additional $125 (including the $48.70 color ribbon).andP;  Although thecolor upgrade is normally installed by the user, Genicom provided the eviewunit with the upgrade already installed.andM;Setting up this printer is nearly trivial.andP;  The paper path for the built-inpush tractor is unambiguous, and the tractor itself is easy to load andadjust.andP;  Installing the ribbon is a little trickier, but you can learneverything you need from a quick glance at the illustrations in the manual.andM;As shipped, the 1040 wakes up in Epson LQ-2500 mode and uses the printer'sparallel port.andP;  If those are the settings you want, all that remains is toplug in the cable and power cord, turn on the printer, and start printing.andM;If you want to change the emulation to IBM Proprinter XL24 or ANSI, or usethe serial port, you have to flip some DIP switches.andP;  Even this step isreasonably minor, however.andP;  The instructions are easy to find in the manual,and the switches themselves are readily accessible from the front of theprinter.andP;  The only oversight is that the switch functions aren't clearlyidentified in the printer itself.andM;Happily, the lack of labeling is confined strictly to the DIP switches.andP;  Likemany printers, the Genicom 1040 includes a two-character LED with suchcryptic status codes as F4 and C4.andP;  Unlike most such printers, however, thetranslations are clearly listed on the front panel.andP;  A second LED shows thecurrent pitch (10, 12, 15, 17, or 20 character per inch) or displays &quot;PS&quot; forProportional Spacing or &quot;PC&quot; for Proportional Condensed.andM;Front-panel membrane switches include the usual on-line/off-line, line feed,and form feed buttons, as well as the less-common controls for changingpitch, font, and print quality.andP;  In addition, there is a set of clearlylabeled paper-handling controls.andP;  These allow you to load tractor-feed orsingle-sheet paper to the top of the form, to park continuous-form paper outof the way to allow for single sheets, and to momentarily advancecontinuous-form paper to tear off the page.andM;This impressive set of paper-control features is a suitable complement to theprinter's paper-handling abilities.andP;  In addition to the built-in push tractorand friction feed, you can get one of three optional sheet feeders: asingle-bin model for $440, a dual-bin model for $735, or adual-bin-plus-envelope-bin version for $975.andP;  Capacities are 150 sheets perbin or 50 envelopes for the envelope bin.andM;Still another paper-handling option is a $129 external tractor for thealternate, bottom-feed paper path.andP;  You may prefer this for printing on heavypaper or multipart forms, though the built-in tractor handled both of thesewithout problems on our tests.andM;The only resident typeface in the 1040 is Brougham, a close cousin toCourier.andP;  The printer does have a font-card slot under the front-panelcontrols; as of this writing, Genicom sells one font card (not provided forreview).andP;  Additional cards are promised for the near future.andM;As already indicated, the output quality on the Genicom 1040 is superb.andP;  OnPC Labs tests, draft-quality text was easily readable and letter-qualityoutput was unusually dark and crisp, with individual characters lookingalmost fully formed.andP;  Graphics output was similarly impressive.andP;  All solidareas, both in color and in black, were nicely filled in; cross-hatched areasand patterns retained all their detail, and the scanned photo retained bothdetail and shading.andM;On the PC Labs speed tests, the 1040 came in with goods scores: under theEpson emulation, 114 characters per second for high-speed draft, 103 cps fordraft, and 66 cps for letter-quality--an eminently readable, 12-pitch,draft-quality mode.andM;The Genciom 1040 offers a lot of pluses with no important minuses.andP;  It willgive you color, letter-quality, and draft-quality text, sophisticated paperhandling, and impact printing for multipart forms.andP;  If what you need is asingle all-purpose printer, the Genicom 1040 is a good bet.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
