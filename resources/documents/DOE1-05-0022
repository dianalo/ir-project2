<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0022 </DOCNO><TEXT>Various SiC sintering processes can involve competition between shrinkage-freeand high-shrinkage sintering mechanisms. The shrinkage-free sinteringmechanism appears to constitute an evaporation/condensation process.In the case of recrystallized SiC, this is the dominant sintering mechanismand should be encouraged as part of the prodution process. The occurrenceof low-shrinkage mechanism is regarded as undesirable in the manufactureof dense SiC-base sintering materials. The evaporation/condensation processappears to be suppressible through the addition of free carbon and/orexposure of the closed system to an external mechanical pressure. Theproposed sintering model allows comparison of the sintering behaviorof the material variants RSiC, SSiC, HPSiC and HIPSiC, which until nowwas not possible.</TEXT></DOC>
