The thrift holding company said the SEC hadn't questioned its reported 1986 net income of $11.3 million.    Citizens Savings reported 1986 per-share earnings rose to $5.62 from $2.83 a share in 1985. The company said it chose not to follow the SEC's suggestion that it reflect in its earnings statements an imputed market rate dividend on the preferred stock issued to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. That preferred was issued as part of Citizens' acquisition of a troubled Lancaster, Ohio, thrift, Equitable Federal Savings Bank.    Citizens Savings said that had it followed the SEC's suggestion, its would have posted 1986 per-share earnings of $4.84. The company said it couldn't give assurance that it won't be required to reflect that dividend.    SEC officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
