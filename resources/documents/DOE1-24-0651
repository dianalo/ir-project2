Here, the relativeline intensities of the low rotational transitions of (C-12)O and (C-13)Omolecules were calculated for regions with temperature gradients andwere found to be very different from those expected from an isothermalregion at any temperature. The standard procedure used in the analysisof CO data under assumption of uniform temperature was then applied tothe results of the calculations with a temperature gradient. It was foundthat the deduced filling factors were less (or greater) than unity ifthe temperature increased (decreased) toward the center of the molecularcloud. It is concluded that the deduced filling factors (and, thus, theclumpiness) are an artifact of the assumption of uniform temperatureadopted in the data analysis. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
