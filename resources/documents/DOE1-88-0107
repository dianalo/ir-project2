The paper deals with theset-up (basic elements) of such plants, their principle of function,and different structural concepts (distributed collector system, centralreceiver system), as well as with the state of development and the possibleuses of these two types of solar power plants. It discusses for photovoltaicplants the aims in research and development, system technology, comprehensivesystems, and spheres of use. The growing market for solar cells is dealtwith as well as solar and photovoltaic power generation in Austria (Kaernten)and the influence of the criteria of choice on site potential (maps,nature and landscape protection, tourism, infra-structure, grid connection,site description). For Alpine solar power plants, site potentials areindicated (examples of sites). Periods of use and economic efficiencyare further subjects, as well as possible market shares. The report finallypoints out that the market for photovoltaic systems is still small inAustria. (HWJ)</TEXT></DOC>
