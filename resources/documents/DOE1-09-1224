<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-09-1224 </DOCNO><TEXT>State-of-the-art n/p and p/n heteroface GaAs cells, processed by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, were irradiated by 1 MeV electronsand 37 MeV protons and their performance determined as a function offluence. It was found that the p/n cells were more radiation resistantthan the n/p cells. The increased loss in the n/p cells was attributedto increases in series resistance and losses in the p-region resultingfrom the irradiation. The greater loss in fill factor observed for then/p cells introduces the possibility that the presently observed superiorityof the p/n cells may not be an intrinsic property of this configurationin GaAs.</TEXT></DOC>
