This plan is intendedto provide specific guidance for the management of furbearers and theiruses, including trapping. Because of the importance of furbearers as awildlife resource and the local and national interest in their managementand use, the Service determined under the provisions of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act that an environmental assessment needed to be prepared. It should be noted that the Service has substantially modified its preferredalternative (Alternative B) for managing furbearers on the Kenai Refugefrom proposals in the draft Furbearer Management Plan. The Service tookthis action in response to the public comments received on the draft planand recommendations from the Kenai Refuge furbearer management charrette,held on December 2-4, 1987, in Soldotna. The Service is accepting comments, suggestions and recommendations fromthe public on this draft environmental assessment for 45 days. The commentperiod will end on February 26, 1988.
