But after some celebrating, members plunged intotrying to build a free-market environmental movement. Thetransition was appropriate. As communism exits history'sstage, the main threat to liberty may come from a utopianenvironmental movement that, like socialism, views thewelfare of human beings as subordinate to &quot;higher&quot; values.   The Mont Pelerin Society was founded in 1947, when alonely band of free marketeers met at a Swiss resort.Nationalism and fascism had ended the classical liberalorder, and communism was grinding much of humanity under aboot. Two founders -- Milton Friedman and F. A. Hayek -- havesince not only won Nobel Prizes but have lived to seesocialism discredited.</LP><TEXT>   Neither man attended this year's meeting, but some 250kindred spirits from 20 nations gathered to discuss howeconomic incentives can promote environmental values.&quot;Environmentalists have looked to the 160 governments of theworld to solve problems, while ignoring the role the world'sfive billion people can play,&quot; says Richard Stroup of thePolitical Economy Research Center in Bozeman, Mont.   Mr. Stroup notes that when regulations are the primarymeans of ensuring environmental quality, the effort iscostly, cumbersome and divisive. The private sector can befar more responsive to environmental needs if property rightsare expanded and enforced. Resources owned in common -- suchas federal forests -- are subject to political pressures andhave few long-term protectors. Private parties abuse theenvironment where markets do not exist or property rights areunenforceable -- such as in endangered species. In Zimbabwe,where the government sells permits to hunt elephants andtrade in ivory, elephant herds have grown by one-third since1986. The key is to rearrange economic incentives so thatpeople don't find polluting or depleting resources easier andcheaper than not doing so.   Take the current debate over oil exploration in Alaska'scoastal plain. New drilling methods can dramatically limitany environmental disruption and render it temporary. Yetenvironmentalists oppose even exploring for oil in Alaska --they see no possible benefit to the environment. But in itsRainey Wildlife Sanctuary, the National Audubon Societyactually allows oil drilling -- the revenue funds otherconservation efforts. John Baden, head of the Seattle-basedthink tank FREE, suggests the third of the U.S. now owned byWashington would be better managed if it were turned over toenvironmental groups. &quot;They could set stringent rules, allowresponsible development and raise money to buy endangeredland elsewhere,&quot; he says.   Although short on detail, the case for marketenvironmentalism is impressive. An expanding economy is theenvironment's best friend. Poor nations are invariably lesshealthy and more polluted places than wealthy nations. Mostpeople in advanced societies care as much for clean air andwater as do Sierra Club members. Just as the key to aprosperous economy is to let markets respond to consumerpreferences, the best way to enhance the environment may beto use market incentives to channel human self-interest intolong-term thinking.   Still, the Mont Pelerinites have an uphill battle.Environmental doomsayers have convinced many that the samegovernment that subsidizes the cutting of 800-year-old sprucein Alaska can best promote green values. And the politicalagenda of radical greens didn't go unnoticed at Big Sky. MontPelerin President Gary Becker noted the most extremesupporters of command-and-control environmental methods areoften the kind of people who once embraced socialism --young, urban intellectuals. The political result could evenbe the same -- placing control of the economy into the handsof an elite that will then monopolize power.   &quot;True conservationists in Europe have no use forquasi-Marxist Greens,&quot; says Peter Stein of Sweden, wherevoters tossed the Green Party out of parliament Sunday. &quot;Theycall them watermelons -- green on the outside and red on theinside.&quot;   ---   Mr. Fund is a Journal editorial writer.</TEXT></DOC>
