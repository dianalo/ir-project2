Sewell, director for the Immigrationand Naturalization Service's Harlingen District, where more than100,000 Central American immigrants are expected to pass throughthis year.   More than 1,000 Central Americans, primarily from Nicaragua andEl Salvador, formed a half-mile-long line Wednesday to apply forpolitical asylum at the new INS processing location at the agency'sremote rural detention center southeast of Harlingen.   It was their first chance to file for political amnesty since theINS processing center in Harlingen was closed Friday because ofalleged health and fire code violations.   Sewell and other INS officials contend that many seeking asylumare here only to better themselves economically and use the asylumprocess and lengthy appeals to get into the United States. Politicalasylum is granted only to those fleeing persecution for political orother reasons.   ``I'm waiting for more direction from Washington, and I thinkthere's going to be some action taken to relieve this problem,''Sewell said while taking a look at the line of immigrants outsidethe minimum-security, 347-acre Port Isabel Service Processing Center.   He declined to reveal what that action might be.   Sewell said Tuesday that detention for the asylum-seekers whiletheir cases are under review is one alternative being considered.Mario Ortiz, the INS' regional public affairs director, repeatedWednesday that a detention camp remains a possibility.   The INS detention center is in eastern Cameron County near theunincorporated community of Bayview, just south of the LagunaAtascosa National Wildlife Refuge and 15 miles northeast ofBrownsville.   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela of Brownsville has said he wouldrule by Monday on whether the INS can resume a policy of requiringasylum-seekers to stay in southern Texas while their cases arereviewed.   The judge on Jan. 9 issued a temporary restraining order forcingthe INS to allow them to travel to their U.S. destinations afterchecking in with the agency's Harlingen District.   But Vela has said he probably would allow the INS to resume theno-travel policy for all asylum-seekers after the restraining orderexpires Monday.   The INS originally began the travel restriction to relieve hugebacklogs of thousands of asylum cases in cities such as Miami andLos Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
