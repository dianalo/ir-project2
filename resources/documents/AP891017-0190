Shamir told supporters of his right-wing Likud bloc at a rallyin Ramle: ``In everything related to the Land of Israel, we shallstand as one man, and we will not give in, even if we would have toface a conflict. I hope we would not have to. It is not justifiedfrom the American point of view, but totally justified from theJewish and the Israeli points of view.''   Shamir rejected American efforts to arrange negotiations betweenIsraeli and Palestinian delegations in Cairo. President HosniMubarak of Egypt has offered to play host to such talks.   ``The stone-throwers, the firebombers have not succeeded indriving us into the arms of the PLO. It is not possible that whenthey fail to do this, others by diplomatic means and exerciseswould try to bring us to meetings with the PLO,'' Shamir said.   He said the proposed meeting would be a ``trap'' in which otherparties would try to make Israel ``slide into recognition of aPalestinian state.''   Israel has balked at the proposed meeting with Palestinianrepresentatives because it fears the Palestinians would be membersof the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel considers the PLOa terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it.   Shamir told a closed-door meeting of Likud legislators earlierTuesday that Israel might be ``entering a period of tension withthe United States,'' Israel radio reported.   On Tuesday, a human rights group reported that Israeli soldierskilled 20 Palestinians in the first two weeks of October, one ofthe bloodiest periods of the 22-month-old uprising against Israelirule in the occupied lands.   The increase in deaths followed a change in army orders lastmonth that allows soldiers to fire live ammunition at maskedPalestinians who ignore orders to halt, even if they are not armed.   Army reports said at least eight Palestinians killed in thefirst 15 days of October wore masks.   According to the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights,the early October death toll was second only to the same period inApril 1988, when 23 Palestinians were killed.   Soldiers or Israeli civilians have killed 596 Palestinians sincethe uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip, and 40 Israelis have died. At least 130 Palestinians havebeen killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboratingwith Israel.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured three West Bank townsTuesday, including Beit Sahour, where soldiers and tax agents havecarried out tax raids for three weeks.   Reporters and photographers were not allowed to accompany Rabininto the Christian town, which the army has declared a ``closedmilitary zone.''   Telephone lines also have been cut to Beit Sahour, a town ofabout 10,000 known for widespread compliance with a tax boycottcalled by the uprising leadership.   Israeli officials said up to $1 million worth of furniture,machinery and other goods had been confiscated in Beit Sahour andwould be sold to recover unpaid taxes. The town is prosperousbecause scores of small, family-owned factories operate there.   ``Everyone, everywhere, pays taxes,'' Rabin said after touringBeit Sahour.   In nearby Bethlehem, a soldier pursuing Palestinianstone-throwers was slightly injured by a rock and troopers openedfire, wounding one Palestinian, the army said. A second man wasreported arrested.   Elsewhere, seven other Palestinians were shot and wounded inclashes with Israeli troops, Arab hospital officials reported. Thearmy said it was checking the reports.</TEXT></DOC>
