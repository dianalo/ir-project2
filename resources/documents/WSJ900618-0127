After a decade of career obsession, more professionals andmanagers are balking at grueling hours, frequent travel andfamily neglect. There's a push for equilibrium between workand home, even at a cost of lost promotions and pay.</LP><TEXT>   And that means pressing often reluctant companies for morework schedule options. Last week, the Senate approvedlegislation already passed by the House that would requirecompanies to give workers up to 12 weeks annual unpaid leavefor childbirth, adoption or serious family illnesses. ButPresident Bush has threatened to veto it, saying suchbenefits should be offered voluntarily. Business groupslikewise oppose the measure and say many companies alreadyoffer such benefits.   Even if it survives to become a law, the legislationcovers only special circumstances, and many employees sayday-to-day problems need addressing, too. To achieve balance,some are negotiating part-time jobs or switching toslower-paced careers. Others are staying in full-time jobsbut limiting business travel and their daily schedules.   &quot;Unless I'm inventing a cure for AIDS, unless I'm reallymaking a major social contribution, it's not worth missing mydaughter growing up,&quot; says Judy Pesin, 38 years old, who onceworked 12-hour days as a vice president of Citicorp butswitched to part-time work there after the birth of her childfour years ago. &quot;I'm good at what I do, but delivering $50million in banker's acceptances isn't worth the tradeoff.&quot;   For the most part, it's women who are leading the push forflexible work schedules, and getting them at a small butgrowing number of companies. The drive is especially evidentfor baby boomer women in their 30s and early 40s who've hadfewer and later-born children, and now want to invest as muchenergy in their progeny as their deals.   Consider Joan Cohlan, 35, who after her son was borncontinued to work a frenetic pace as a marketing executive atCiticorp. When she wasn't at the office, she was out-of-townon business or grappling with a 90-minute commute. &quot;Thechallenge was to be like a man,&quot; she says. &quot;But I missed thefirst three years of my son's life.&quot; So she quit to doconsulting work from her home, and to learn she was &quot;capableof being a good mother.&quot;   When her son was five, Ms. Cohlan took a full-timemanagement job at Nynex Corp. nearer to her home in WhitePlains, N.Y., and tries to limit her daily work schedule to10 hours. She believes she has the best of both worlds now --a professional challenge coupled with family support. Sheearns less than she did at Citicorp, so she and her husbandhave shelved home-renovation plans, deferred vacations andfrequent dinners out. But she's gained &quot;a sense of family.&quot;   Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a research firm, noted asimilar shift in its annual surveys of American values andlife style. &quot;We're finding that having it all and doing itall is neither desirable nor practical,&quot; says Barbara Caplan,the vice president of the firm. Both women and men arebeginning to &quot;reassess&quot; tradeoffs between work and family,she says.   Many women are still deeply committed to work, but &quot;theissue here is options,&quot; Ms. Caplan says. And &quot;while men don'twant to be Mr. Moms, they're rethinking how much of theirfamily lives, friends and leisure they're willing to giveup.&quot;   In fact, more than half of 500 men polled recently byRobert Half International, the executive recruiting firm,said they'd be willing to cut their salaries as much as 25%to have more family or personal time; about 45% said they'dlikely turn down a promotion if it meant spending less timewith their families.   Paul Whitehead, a 39-year-old attorney at the UnitedSteelworkers union in Pittsburgh, has strong memories of&quot;hearing the back door shut in our house every day at 4:52p.m., hearing my dad walk into the front hall and kiss my momhello. I associate my happy childhood with a father who washome.&quot; Mr. Whitehead used to routinely put in 70 hours a weekat work. But since he married and subsequently had a sonthree years ago, he's learned to do more in fewer hours, sothere's time left over for family.   Not all bosses or colleagues understand, however.Switching to the balanced track is a risky proposition thatalmost always includes a price -- a cut in pay perhaps orloss of a promotion. Sometimes it's a decline in careerstatus, or respect. &quot;If you acknowledge that you like tospend a lot of time with your family, you risk being seen asnot sufficiently dedicated to your job,&quot; says DavidMachlowitz, who left a New York law firm three years ago fora less-frenetic corporate counsel's job.   He still works long days and travels out-of-town onbusiness, but he has &quot;more control over scheduling,&quot; he says.Nevertheless, after talking openly about his career switch, aco-worker in another department sent his boss a snide notesaying, &quot;Gee, can I get a job in your department?&quot;   Mr. Machlowitz warns those who want more time outside workto &quot;make sure you'll be judged on the basis of what youaccomplish rather than the mere hours you spend in theoffice, even if you spend them talking about football oroffice gossip.&quot;   Indeed, many companies still equate high performance withphysical presence at work, rather than contributions, leavingemployees with responsibilities for children or elderlyrelatives at a &quot;distinct disadvantage,&quot; says Fran Rodgers,president of Work/Family Directions, a Watertown, Mass.,consulting firm.   Linda Ortwein, a principal at Kurt Salwyn Associates, aNew York management consulting company, has squeezed herweekly work load into a four-day, 40-hour schedule since herdaughter turned one. While her productivity hasn't slipped,she believes that &quot;in the short term I may not have the sameopportunities to advance.&quot; And although she often works athome in the evenings, she worries about whether her stafffeels resentful when she leaves the office each day at 6 p.m.   Slowing down in times of managerial and cost cutbacks canbe chancy, too. Says one Wall Street skeptic: &quot;If your firmis going through a 20% cutback, do you want to be the firstone to say you want part-time work?&quot;   Most corporations are only beginning to come to grips withtensions in the modern work force, where more than half ofwomen return to their jobs within a year of having a childand 60% of employed men have employed wives. Yet thehigh-cost of replacing experienced employees and othereconomic factors are propelling companies to offer morefamily-supportive policies. A survey of 259 major employersby Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm, shows that55% offer some form of child-care aid, 31% provide elder-careaid, 56% have flexible scheduling, 42% offer unpaid parentalleave and 14% provide adoption benefits.   &quot;Companies are being pressured to accommodate more -- butthey're reacting with schizophrenic sensitivity,&quot; saysKathleen Christensen, a City University of New York professorwho surveyed flexible scheduling at 521 U.S. corporations.&quot;They say sure you can work at home as long as you do 80hours a week, or they give one person part time, but don'treduce that person's work load.&quot;   And even compressed work schedules don't leave very muchtime for families. Gloria Jacobs works four days a week as asenior editor at New York Woman magazine. But on those fourdays, she says, &quot;I come home beat to kids who are also tired.There's really no life with them during the week.&quot; She alsoworries she may not be there for guidance. &quot;There's a lotgoing on at school -- racial tensions, boy-girl issues -- and{my eight-year-old daughter} wants to talk about it when shegets out for the day, not at 7:30 at night.&quot;   Others believe some jobs simply can't be done onflex-time. Marlee Myers, a partner at Kirkpatrick andamp; Lockhartin Pittsburgh, says she's had to accept that her corporatepractice can't fit into a part-time or even normal full-timework schedule. &quot;You don't know if you'll be working until 10p.m. or 2 a.m. or around the clock -- but you have to dowhatever it takes to get the deal done.&quot;   She's able to do that, she acknowledges, because herhusband, a free-lance writer, can always be home for dinnerwith their two children, ages seven and 10. Ms. Myers is also&quot;skeptical&quot; about what critics deride as &quot;the mommy track,&quot;and wonders if part-timers can really get ahead. &quot;You can bea part-time lawyer and not do the kind of work I do, but tome it's not the most challenging work. You have to make achoice, and there's a price you pay.&quot;   That ability to make a choice is the point for many, andit looks as if it may become available to more employees astime goes on. Peter Friedes, chief executive of HewittAssociates, the benefits consulting firm, believes that overthe next 20 years a &quot;normal career&quot; will be replaced by&quot;multiple paths that people will take trying to be goodworkers and good parents.&quot; Companies will operate like skiresorts, he believes, with multiple starting points, pathsand ending points at the bottom of the mountain. &quot;Even theidea of stopping half way down the mountain for lunch seemsapplicable to a career,&quot; he says.   Laura Meyer, a 39-year-old Citicorp manager, felt her ownhalf-way stop was an enjoyable pause in a demanding career.After her second child was born two years ago, she took aone-year leave from her job as director of investor relationsto spend more time with her family. And because she'd lefther job &quot;in a senior capacity with good exposure,&quot; returningto another senior position was no problem.   Similarly Susan Reid Morris, a 35-year-old Washington,D.C., attorney who switched from full-time to a part-timeposition after the birth of her daughter, says her path hasalready produced a payoff for her daughter's future. &quot;Whenshe's asked what she wants to do when she grows up, she saysshe wants to be a lawyer and a mommy. In her mind, she's sureit can work out.&quot;   ---                   Reshaping the Workweek                                                                                                                         What Companies Offer Now                                                                                                          Availability of flexible scheduling according to a surveyof 259 companies                                                                                                          No flexible scheduling .......................... 44%   Flextime ........................................ 42%   Part-time employment ............................ 36%   Job sharing ..................................... 17%   Compressed work schedule ........................ 13%   Work at home ....................................  9%   Other ...........................................  3%                                                                                                          Source: Hewitt Assoc.
