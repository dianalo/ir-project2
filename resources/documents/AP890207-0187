VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis left more than $2.6 million topay for shutting down his Democratic presidential campaignoperation, while Republican George Bush spent almost everything hehad to win the White House, their financial reports showed.   Dukakis campaign treasurer Robert A. Farmer said Tuesday theMassachusetts governor ``is the sort of man who does not want adebt.''   During the campaign, Dukakis fostered a public image of frugalityand bragged about having a 25-year-old snowblower to clear hisdriveway.   ``If you're prudent, you keep a reserve to pay your expenses,''Farmer said.   However, there was some confusion among Dukakis aides over howthe surplus was reported.   ``We definitely did not run a surplus,'' said Jack Corrigan, acampaign aide to Dukakis who how works for him in the governor'soffice.   Nevertheless, Corrigan said he could not explain the figures onthe campaign's financial report filed with the Federal ElectionCommission.   The leftover money comes from the $46.1 million Bush and Dukakiseach got from the federal Treasury to pay for their general electioncampaigns. Under federal election laws, candidates using publicmoney in the general election cannot also use private money for thecampaign.   However, the law does allow the candidates to raise money for thesole purpose of covering the costs of legal and other expensesinvolved in closing down their operations after the election.   The candidates can cover these expenses with money they got fromthe federal government, but that drains cash away from the campaignto win the election, said Fred Eiland, a spokesman for the FederalElection Commission.   While the Bush campaign ended with a surplus of just under$70,000, its November victory gives it the ability to raise moremoney if it's needed to close down.   However, Dukakis does not have that ability, Farmer said. On topof losing the presidential election, he announced he would not runfor re-election in next year's gubernatorial election.   ``My understanding is we spent almost to the nickel the amount ofmoney we could spend on the campaign,'' he said.   Farmer said it may take two years to close out the campaign.   Dukakis' year-end report filed with the Federal ElectionCommission showed he wound up with more than $3.9 million in cash,with outstanding debts of nearly $1.3 million.   The same report for Bush showed he had $272,359 in cash at theend of the year and had $202,537 in debts.   Democrat Gary Hart and Republican Bob Dole ended their campaignsin the black. Hart, a former senator from Colorado, wound up with$155,876 in the bank and $2,156 in debts, while Dole, the Senateminority leader, had $28,098 in cash and $1,682 in debts.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Republican Pete du Pont of Delawarealso ended the year with their campaigns out of debt. Simon had$454,360 in cash and $94,346 in debts, while du Pont had $50,799 incash and didn't owe anything, according to their FEC reports.   Television evangelist Pat Robertson's campaign for the GOPpresidential nomination ended the year in debts with $516,158 inbills with just $19,420 in the bank. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., alsoended in the red with $53,332 in debts and $5,180 in cash, accordingto reports filed with the FEC.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., also ended in debt, with $10,330 inthe bank and $427,049 in bills.   The Rev. Jesse Jackson has not yet filed a year-end report on hispresidential campaign, according to the FEC.</TEXT></DOC>
