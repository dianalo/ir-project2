(Earth Observing System)</TITLE><AUTHOR>: Van Nostrand, Jim.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The Earth Observing System (Eos) satellite constellation willconsist of four satellites, each four times as big and seven timesas heavy as the Landsat satellites that preceded Eos and connectedwith a data-management system that will begin transmitting data ata rate of 300 Mbps back to the United States, Europe and Japan inthe late 1990's.andP;  NASA will launch two of the EOS platforms.andP;  Theother two will be launched by the European Space Agency and by theJapanese government.andP;  Challenges still to be faced include theneed for in-space servicing of components and instruments, highdata rates and sheer platform size.andP;  The volume and broad natureof the data require development of an extensive, expandable anddistributed rapid-access information system.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     SatellitesSpace CraftEarth Observing System (artificial satellite)NASASoftware EngineeringInformation Resources ManagementOn-Board SystemsInformation Storage and RetrievalData Acquisition Systems.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Relative sizes of Earth observation platforms.
