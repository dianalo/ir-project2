While the chemical weapons plan was the centerpiece of hisremarks, Bush also paid tribute to the Soviet Union for removing``a number of obstacles'' on treaties reducing long-range nuclearweapons as well as troops and tanks in Europe.   Bush took note of the array of agreements reached during aweekend of talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker III andSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, as well as adecision to hold a summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev by early next summer.   ``Each of these achievements is important in its own right, butthey are more important still as signs of a new attitude thatprevails between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.,'' he said. ``Seriousdifferences remain _ we know that _ but the willingness to dealconstructively and candidly with those differences is news that we,and indeed the world, must welcome.''   Bush's nationally televised speech marked his first to theUnited Nations General Assembly as president. Bush served as U.N.ambassador in the early 1970s, and told his audience it was a``homecoming for both Barbara and me.''   His speech was interrupted twice by applause, once when hecalled for the elimination of chemical weapons, and again when hetouched on the progress of the weekend superpower talks.   Shevardnadze, who will address the world body Tuesday, calledBush's speech ``a constructive statement in the spirit of thetimes, in the spirit of the tasks that we are facing, that the U.S.is facing and in a broader context, too.''   He said the Soviet Union had a ``positive view'' of the chemicalweapons proposals.   In his remarks, Bush said the world was witnessing a ``rise offreedom,'' and cited advances in Hungary, Poland, Latin America andAfrica.   ``Make no mistake. Nothing can stand in the way of freedom'smarch,'' the president said.   ``Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise ofthe totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state,'' hesaid.   Yet, he cautioned, ``We have not entered an era of perpetualpeace.'' He said regimes throughout the world were emerging ``armedwith old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of massdestruction.   Bush said regional conflicts ``may well threaten world peace asnever before.''   His offer to slash U.S. chemical weapon stockpiles was both achallenge to the Soviet Union to follow his lead and an invitationto the 38 other nations whose negotiations in Geneva to ban theweapons are moving at a snail's pace.   ``Let us act together, beginning today, to rid the earth of thisscourge,'' he said.   Baker had given Shevardnadze advance word of the chemicalweapons proposal during their talks in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The twoagreed on a two-stage U.S.-Soviet program to exchange informationabout their chemical weapons and to inspect each other's plants andarsenals.   Only the United States and the Soviet Union admit to havingposion gas. But Bush said more than 20 nations possess chemicalweapons or the capability to produce them.   ``And these horrible weapons are now finding their way intoregional conflicts,'' he said. ``This is unacceptable.''   He referred to U.S. accusations that Iraq and Iran both usedpoison gas in the Persian Gulf war.   ``For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse thisthreat.''   Bush outlined a series of steps the United States was willing totake ``to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons'' and movetoward an international ban to take effect 10 years after anagreement was signed.   The three major elements of Bush's plan:   _While working to complete a global agreement, the United Stateswill eliminate more than 80 percent of its stockpile ``if theSoviet Union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equallevel, and we agree on the conditions, including inspections, underwhich stockpiles are destroyed,'' Bush said.   _Once an international treaty is signed, the United States willdestroy more than 98 percent of its current chemical weaponsstockpile over an eight-year period, provided the Soviet Unionjoins the ban. ``I think they will,'' he said.   _The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed over the next twoyears after all countries capable of producing chemical weaponsbecome partners to the agreement.   The Soviets acknowledge having 50,000 tons of chemical weapons;some analysts think they may have more. The United States has neverpublicly released figures on its own arsenal; analysts estimate ittotals 30,000 tons.   Bush said it would be difficult to monitor a total ban onchemical weapons but said recent research, as well as informationobtained in recent arms control discussions ``makes me believe wecan achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence togo forward with the ban.''   On other fronts, Bush called for international cooperation onillegal drugs, the environment and terrorism.   He said narcotics were ``a menace to social order and a sourceof human misery whereever they gain a foothold. The nations whosuffer this scourge must join forces in the fight. And we are.''   Urging a united stand on terrorism, Bush said, ``Hostage takingand the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win theworld's approval.''   Bush urged the General Assembly to condemn the murder of MarineLt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was taken hostage in Lebanon whileon a U.N. peacekeeping mission last year. His captors said theyhanged him this summer in retaliation for Israel's abduction of aMoslem cleric.   The president said Higgins was a ``soldier of peace'' and calledon those resposible for his death to ``have the decency'' to returnhis body.   ``And let us all right now _ right here _ rededicate ourselvesand our nations to the cause that Col. Higgins served soselflessly.''   Bush had a full day of activities at the United Nations. Amongthem: separate meetings with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez deCuellar, Brazil's President Jose Sarney, Israeli Finance MinisterShimon Peres, Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo, VenezuelanPresident Carlos Andres Perez and Bolivian President Jaime PazZamora.   Bush also scheduled a lunch for NATO allies, and with his wifeBarbara, a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a diplomaticreception and dinner.   In their weekend meetings, Baker and Shevardnadze signed anagreement to exchange data on chemical weapons by the end of theyear and allow visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpilesand plants by June 30. In a second phase, there would be moreintensive on-site inspections of the submitted data.   They also reached agreement on the broad principles forverifying limits on strategic forces and nuclear tests.   In a major development, the Soviets said they would drop theirdemand that the United States abandon work on its Star Wars missiledefense program before concluding a treaty curbing long-rangemissiles, bombers and submarines.</TEXT></DOC>
