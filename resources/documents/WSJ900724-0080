So beforeelaborating on the Supreme Court, we'd like to pause a momentto note that in reversing Oliver North's convictions, theFederal Court of Appeals has ruled that the Iran-Contraprosecutions were indeed kangaroo trials.   The court's tight reasoning Friday reversed all threeNorth convictions -- one outright and the other two pendingtheoretically possible reinstatement after seeminglyimpossible further hearings. It ruled that the Northconvictions, and by implication presumably the JohnPoindexter conviction as well, may have been tainted by themisdeeds of Congress and Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh.</LP><TEXT>   Congress forced Mr. North to testify in public during thesummer of 1987. His testimony didn't go the way hisinquisitors had planned; he became a national hero instead ofan excuse to impeach President Reagan. The legal significancewas that Congress forced Mr. North to abandon his rightagainst self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. When adefendant is given immunity and forced to testify in public,any trial must proceed without any use in any way of thecoerced testimony. No witnesses, prosecutors or jurors can be&quot;tainted&quot; by Mr. North's testimony to Congress.   At Mr. Walsh's urging, trial Judge Gerhard Gesell failedto hold a hearing on this issue. Now the appeals court saysif anyone wants to keep pursuing Mr. North, there will haveto be a hearing to &quot;inquire into the content as well as thesources of the grand jury and trial witnesses' testimony.&quot;The court added that the inquiry &quot;must proceedwitness-by-witness; if necessary, it will proceedline-by-line and item-by-item.&quot;   &quot;We readily understand how court and counsel might sighprior to such an undertaking,&quot; the court said, in anot-very-subtle message to Mr. Walsh and/or Judge Gesell tocall the whole thing off. The judges said such a hearing&quot;could consume substantial amounts of time, personnel, andmoney, only to lead to the conclusion that a defendant&quot;cannot get a fair trial.   Many witnesses admit hearing Mr. North's congressionaltestimony; one witness, Rep. Lee Hamilton, had earlier beenone of his interrogators. As we wrote two years and millionsof taxpayer dollars ago, the immunity issue was one of manythat would have stopped any normal U.S. Attorney frombringing this case.   The Fifth Amendment here is no Miranda-style technicality.While reversing on narrower grounds, the appeals court sawhere the same principle that led the Founding Fathers toinclude constitutional provisions banning ex post facto lawsor bills of attainder. This was a political battlemasquerading as a criminal case. The court wrote, &quot;We do notcountenance political trials in this country, and this matteris not styled Independent Counsel v. Executive Branch or evenCongress v. Executive Branch.&quot;   It is now clearer than ever that Mr. Walsh should cut hislosses and go home. Or President Bush should send himpacking. Congress should forswear its triple punch of forcinga presidential aide to testify, then sicking a loose-cannonspecial prosecutor on him, then having the congressionaltestimony used in criminal court. We can hope that Mr.North's wrongful trial might be this country's lastexperiment with political prosecutions.</TEXT></DOC>
