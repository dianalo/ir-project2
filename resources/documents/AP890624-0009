Their tape-recorded portrayals of sexual encounters _ part of amultibillion-dollar business known as dial-a-porn _ were ruledconstitutional, within some restrictions, by a unanimous high courtFriday.   The decision, based on the First Amendment guarantee of freespeech, rejected a federal law that sought to ban telephonepornography outright. Obscene messages can be banned, the courtsaid, but simply ``indecent'' ones cannot.   ``It's fantastic. The First Amendment will not be put down,''said Gloria Leonard, publisher of the sex magazine High Society anda leading dial-a-porn entrepreneur. ``We feel very triumphant.''   But telephone pornography opponents claimed victory, too.   ``Many, many of these messages are obscene,'' said Len Munsil,lawyer for the Children's Legal Campaign in Phoenix.   As such, he said, they fall under the remaining ban.   The debate began in 1983, when the court-ordered breakup of thetelephone company gave independent companies the right to operateinformation services. Callers pay the fee, usually up to a fewdollars, on their phone bill. In exchange, they can hear women, ormen, make suggestive comments.   The problem: Curious children were calling the numbers umpteentimes, racking up enormous phone bills.   Parents were not amused. Neither were organizations such asMunsil's, which has been mounting lobbying and courtroom campaignsto have dial-a-porn banned as a corrupting influence on minors.   ``There's no way to discriminate between adults and children inthe listening audience,'' said Munsil. ``And it's quite clear thatthese messages are harmful to children.''   Beyond citing protections of free speech, Ms. Leonard pointed todial-a-porn's financial success as evidence that it meets communitystandards of acceptability. ``At its peak, a number of years ago, wewere getting half a million calls a day,'' she said.   While Ms. Leonard said her business is off dramatically _ down toperhaps 5,000 calls a day _ she attributes that to a proliferationof competitors, not any lessened interest in sex talk.   ``There are dozens if not hundreds of these numbers in everycity,'' she said. ``This stuff has really taken off, on amom-and-pop basis.''   But a source in the Justice Department speaking on condition ofanonymity said many of the dial-a-porn services appear to havecorporate links.   The opportunity for profit is great; all that's required is acontract with the local phone company for an information servicenumber _ often given under the ``976'' exchange _ a switchboardcapable of handling many calls at once, and women and men willing tobe recorded making suggestive words and noises.   Some of the services provide live telephone contacts.   Although complete figures haven't been compiled, court recordssay 180 million dial-a-porn calls were placed in New York in 1984.California has 204 separate dial-a-porn services, making up 25percent of its information service numbers.   Nationwide, the industry did an estimated $2 billion in businesslast year.   Congress asked the Federal Communications Commission to look intorestricting dial-a-porn in 1983, and last year the federal lawmakersdecided to ban the services outright.   Although the court rejected the ban on messages that are only``indecent,'' other restrictions are possible.   Diane Killory, the FCC's general counsel, said the commissionlikely will revive a plan to require access codes, scrambledmessages or credit card payment for dial-a-porn. The principle isthat children, lacking the codes, unscramblers or credit cards,could not make the calls.   Other steps are possible. In California, for example, PacificBell will cut off 976 access to customers who request it, and800,000 have done so.   And the ban on obscene messages remains in effect, although thedifference between obscenity and indecency can be a difficult one todraw.   ``I don't believe that what we do is obscene,'' Ms. Leonard said.``And if it is, it's yet to be proven.''</TEXT></DOC>
