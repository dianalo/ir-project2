Doctors at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a part of the NIH, said a single dose of the new injected vaccine protects about 75% of those who take it from getting the disease. About 55 million cases of typhoid are reported each year in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it's a major cause of death.    Institute scientists headed an international team that published its findings in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Their study is being conducted among nearly 7,000 villagers in Nepal, where typhoid fever is epidemic. In a pilot study with 274 subjects, only two suffered side effects.    The current vaccine requires two injections and often leaves the patient with a sore arm, fever and bad headaches, and leaves the patient unable to work for three days. It must be given every two or three years for lasting protection. About 70% of those who take this vaccine are effectively protected against getting the ailment.    Another type of vaccine is a pill that must be taken three times to reach a 70% effective rate. This presents serious distribution problems in countries without extensive public-health facilities.    The new vaccine apparently offers &quot;protection significantly longer lasting than current vaccines,&quot; Charles Lowe of the child health institute said in an interview.    Typhoid is an &quot;economically important disease,&quot; he said, because it can put farmers and workers out of work for 20 to 30 days. The disease is contracted through contaminated water, and its symptoms are high and persistent fever and spleen swelling. It frequently strikes during prime working years, and the mortality rate is 2% to 40%, depending on a variety of circumstances.    The disease is uncommon in the U.S. Only 369 cases were reported in 1984, mostly near the Mexican border, according to Dr. Lowe.    But all military recruits are inoculated against the disease. That &quot;usually puts them out for a couple-three days at the time,&quot; said Louis Baron, chief of the department of bacterial immunology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Medical Research.    The military is interested in using the new vaccine because it also can be modified to protect against dysentery and malaria, Dr. Baron added.    The new vaccine is made from the capsule surrounding the cell that carries the disease bacteria. Whole bacteria cells are used to make the current, injected vaccine.    The Institute Merieux of Lyon, France, which manufactures the new vaccine, plans to distribute it throughout the world at a low cost. The drug currently is used only on an experimental basis.
