During this period of increasing demands,the state's oil and gas reserves will be depleted for use in energy production.Texas is looking to lignite and western coal as &quot;transition fuels,&quot; bridgingthe gap between depletion of the state's oil and gas reserves and thecommercialization of the clean, renewable energy sources of the twenty-firstcentury--fusion, solar, wind, and geothermal (Radian 1979). Because ofthe universal scrubbing requirements proposed to comply with the CleanAir Act Amendments of 1977, which have removed the primary advantageof low-sulfur western coal, and because of rising rail transportationrates, it is expected that Texas lignite will be the fuel preferred bymany of the state's utility companies and industries. Lignite miningin Texas is a groundwater issue because most of the mining occurs withina major aquifer system, the Wilcox Group. Extraction of the lignite byopen-pit mining or in situ gasification can potentially affect quantityand quality of groundwater resources. This paper discusses the seriousnessof past impacts and the potential for future impacts.</TEXT></DOC>
