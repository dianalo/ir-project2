Frequently, an exploratorylaparotomy was necessary to provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment.Within the past decade, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) havebroadened our diagnostic ability by permitting visualization of the pelvicmass itself; a natural evolution in sequencing of diagnostic tests hasensued. In some instances, these newer imaging techniques disclose amass not requiring treatment (e.g., pelvic kidney, fibroid uterus, orovarian cyst). In masses requiring treatment, information provided byultrasound or CT frequently aids in directing various therapeutic options,that is antibiotics, surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Moreover, visualizationof the mass itself permits interventional radiologic options such aspercutaneous biopsy or drainage. The imaging approach to a pelvic massvaries according to a number of different factors: the type of mass clinicallysuspected, patient symptomatology and body habitus, ease of pelvic examination,radiation exposure, the physician's individual training and experience,equipment availability, examination costs, and referral patterns. Thischapter presents a coordinated diagnostic approach to a wide spectrumof common and uncommon pelvic masses. Emphasis is placed on expeditious,cost-effective diagnosis of these masses.</TEXT></DOC>
