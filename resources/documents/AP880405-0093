(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A hunter suspected of illegally shootinga mother bear and leaving her three cubs in a trash bin has agreedto turn himself in, authorities said.   An arrest warrant was issued Monday for the 27-year-old Bay Cityman, who agreed to appear today for arraignment, Crawford CountyProsecutor John Huss said.   The two-count warrant accuses the man of illegally killing abear and of unlawfully possessing a bear or parts of a bear.   The man has said he killed the black bear in self-defense, butDepartment of Natural Resources law enforcement chief Herb Burnssaid that's unlikely.   ``Our evidence points to this being a deliberate shooting andnot the result of a bear attack on the individual,'' he said in astatement Monday.   ``The parts he possessed were the head and the paws,'' saidHuss, adding that he didn't know the reason they were taken. ``Iguess it's like a bullfighter. They take the ears, right?''   The head and claws were found in the suspect's residence afterthe DNR received a tip on its poaching hotline, said Lt. Jay Larsonof the DNR office in Mio.   Killing a bear illegally is a misdemeanor, which carries finesranging from $200 to $1,000, a mandatory five-day jail sentenceextending to up to 90 days, $1,500 in restitution for the animaland a three-year loss of hunting privileges. Illegal bearpossession carries the same penalties, Huss said.   Last week, the suspect led wildlife officials to the bearcarcass in a swamp in the Au Sable State Forest in the northernLower Peninsula. He said he found the bear's cubs after he shot herand left them in a trash container, according to the department.   A conservation officer rescued the two male and one female cubsMarch 24 after someone called a wildlife office and said he foundthe three bears in the trash container, in rural Crawford County.The caller told officers he would leave the cubs in a telephonebooth.   Barb Rogers, who is taking care of the 2-month-old cubs at theWildlife Recovery Association in Midland, has said they cannotsurvive in the wild because they have been handled by humans.   Tom Monaghan, owner of the Detroit Tigers baseball club andDomino's Pizza, has offered to adopt the cubs and give them a homeon a Domino's retreat on Drummond Island in the Upper Peninsula. ADNR official said he hoped the department would be able to turn thecubs over to the retreat within a week.</TEXT></DOC>
