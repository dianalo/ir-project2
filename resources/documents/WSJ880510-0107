For months it was known there would be difficulties in putting through original plans for two of the biggest consumer-products groups in France to team up in operating a major French maker of washing liquids and detergents, the spokesman said.    The venture, announced last year, was to have joined Henkel and New York-based Colgate as 50-50 owners of Lesieur-Cotelle's manufacturing operations and split up marketing and distribution of Lesieur-Cotelle's product lines. But the French competition council has indicated that the strategy probably would run afoul of French fair-competition rules.    In the original agreement, Colgate was to be responsible for soap, window cleaning and bleach operations. Henkel was to market liquid soaps, fabric softeners and household cleaners.    The Henkel spokesman hadn't any comment on how the venture would be rearranged to satisfy French authorities. But he said a detailed statement would be made at the company's annual news conference scheduled for today.    Henkel bought Lesieur-Cotelle from Lesieur S.A. for two billion French francs ($350.4 million) last year. The group has annual sales of 1.35 billion francs. </TEXT></DOC>
