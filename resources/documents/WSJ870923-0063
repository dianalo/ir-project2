In the secondary markets, meanwhile, fixed-coupon Eurodollar bonds posted losses around 3/8 point. The markets recovered partly from even steeper early losses prompted by declines in U.S. Treasurys.    Professionals represented the bulk of dealings, and overall participation was limited by concerns about hostilities in the Persian Gulf and other events that all prompted caution, according to Eurodollar specialists.    Yesterday's syndication activity didn't feature any Eurodollar straight-debt issues, with that sector reportedly hurt by oversupply after $1.35 billion of new bonds were issued last week. &quot;There are a lot of Eurodollar bonds still on dealers' books,&quot; said one official at a U.S. house.    Borrowers tested other variations, however, with four issues in Canadian dollars and two in New Zealand dollars.    Canadian and New Zealand dollar bonds have benefited as investors sought to diversify holdings outside of the declining U.S. dollar. But despite the growth in these bonds, the two sectors still remain relatively small.    Meanwhile, the West German central bank, shortly after meeting with the managers of six Japanese banks and securities houses, announced it was lifting its restrictions and would allow them to lead mark issues in West Germany starting Oct. 1.    However, managers said it doesn't necessarily mean there will be a rush to launch bonds. High yields and lackluster investor demand have damped opportunities for borrowers to launch mark-denominated issues.    &quot;It depends on the market situation,&quot; said Masayuki Yamamura, chairman of Industriebank von Japan AG. &quot;My only concern is that we can tap the market in an orderly and carefully prepared way.&quot;    Japanese banks have held securities licenses since the West German markets were liberalized in May 1986. But they have been prevented from leading new issues by the Bundesbank since then because reciprocity had not been extended to West German banks in Japan.    The latest move by the Bundesbank comes after the last of six West German banks received reciprocal rights in Japan earlier this summer. </TEXT></DOC>
