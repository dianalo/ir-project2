The multiple-count indictment announced Wednesday by the U.S.attorney's office alleged that two small investment firms and threetrading professionals _ including a researcher for troubled DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. _ schemed with others who have been previouslycharged.   It also alleged previously undisclosed links between Drexel, theso-called Yuppie Five insider trading ring exposed two years ago andIvan F. Boesky, the imprisoned speculator who turned state'sevidence after paying the government a record $100 million fine forinsider trading in November 1986.   One of the allegations asserted that an unidentified trader inBoesky's now-defunct firm _ who wasn't charged and apparently is acooperating government witness _ stole tips from Boesky and sharedthem with other co-conspirators.   If so, it suggests that while Boesky was using stolen or boughttips to trade for himself, others were stealing from him.   The indictment also cast a new cloud over Drexel, which isfighting other civil fraud charges by the Securities and ExchangeCommission stemming from its relationship with Boesky and is thetarget of a federal grand jury probe.   The latest charges largely are an outgrowth of the Yuppie Fivecase, in which four young investment professionals and an attorneyconfessed to charges of stealing secret information about takeoversfrom clients and using it to profit in the stock market. Those five,already sentenced in the earlier charges, have been cooperating withfederal investigators.   Accused in the Wednesday indictment were Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. andVictor Teicher andamp; Co., small investment firms in Manhattan. Alsoaccused were D. Ronald Yagoda, 44, head of arbitrage trading atMarcus Schloss; Victor Teicher, 37, head of Teicher; and RossFrankel, 32, head of arbitrage research at Drexel.   Through their attorneys, all the defendants denied any wrongdoingand vowed to fight the charges in court. They are scheduled toformally enter their pleas Nov. 10.   The indictment accused the defendants of participating in aninsider trading ring with the Yuppie Five and the unidentifiedtrader for Boesky, using non-public information about Union CarbideCorp., American Can Corp., Allegheny Inc., Avondale Mills andAmerican Brands Inc. to trade profitably in the stocks of thosecompanies.   The indictment also alleged that Frankel improperly funneled toTeicher the identities of four companies on Drexel's so-calledconfidential ``phantom list,'' identifying potential targets oftakeovers the firm might finance. The indictment identified thecompanies as Republic Airlines Inc., Westchester Financial ServicesCorp., Western Union Corp. and Warnaco Inc.   The defendants face varying counts of securities fraud, mailfraud, wire fraud, perjury and obstruction of an SEC investigation.   Drexel, moving quickly to distance itself from this new source ofpotential trouble, said in a statement that Frankel had taken atemporary leave of absence to devote his efforts to fighting thecharges.   ``Today's indictment of Ross Frankel is disturbing,'' said Drexelspokesman Steven Anreder. ``It would be unfair to prejudge the caseor comment at this time.''   Yagoda's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, suggested his client wasindicted because of a plea agreement between federal prosecutors andAndrew Solomon, a former Schloss apprentice and a member of theYuppie Five ring.   Schloss stated that it ``believes itself innocent of anywrongdoing and will accordingly vigorously contest these charges indue course.''   Robert G. Morvillo, Teicher's attorney, said his client``emphasized most strongly that he never violated those laws and isconfident that his innocence will be established at trial.''   Yagoda was accused of 10 counts, Teicher 22 counts and Frankelseven counts. Each faces a maximum penalty of five years in prisonand a $250,000 fine for each count.   Schloss was accused of eight counts and Teicher's firm 22 counts.Both face a maximum fine of $500,000 for each count.</TEXT></DOC>
