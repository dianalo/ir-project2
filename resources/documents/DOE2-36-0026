This is followed by a description of the tasks andstructure of the gas industry. Finally the paper says that, while notall energy problems can be solved by giving clear preference to gas,gas will help to achieve some basic goals of energy policy, for instanceinternational, environmental, and social compatibility. Economic efficiencywill, however, be subject to the respective price trends for gases andtheir substitutes. (orig./HSCH).</TEXT></DOC>
