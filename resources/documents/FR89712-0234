On December 6, 1988, the Bureau of Export Administrationpublished a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to implement this provision. Having receivedand considered comments, the Bureau of Export Administration is issuinga final rule creating a new general license designated G-COCOM. GeneralLicense G-COCOM is designed for exports to COCOM countries and countriesdetermined to have sufficient export control systems to warrant this benefitunder section 5(k) of the EAA. Commodities that may be exported under GeneralLicense G-COCOM are those described in Supplement No. 2 to Part 771, andthose commodities eligible for General License G-COM or GFW. SupplementNo. 2 to Part 771 lists commodities that could have been exported to thePeople's Republic of China with only notification to other COCOM governmentsas of the date of enactment of the Trade Act. The list of eligible commoditiesmay be upgraded from time to time to reflect action taken by the CoordinatingCommittee (COCOM). Some commodities are ineligible for General License G-COCOM because theyare controlled for other than national security reasons or because theirexport requires more than mere notification to COCOM. A Swiss Blue Import Certificate will be required for exports to Switzerlandunder this General License G-COCOM.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective July 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Patricia Muldonian, RegulationsBranch, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Telephone: (202) 377-2440.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA), signed by the Presidenton August 23, 1988, amended section 5(b)(2) of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979 (EAA), by allowing exports of ``Green Zone'' commodities toCOCOM participating countries and countries determined to be COCOM comparable.Consistent with the OTCA, the Department of Commerce issued a proposedrule on December 6, 1988 (53 FR 49202) with a request for comments on waysto implement the legislative requirements. The proposed rule created a new General License G-COCOM to allow shipmentsof additional low level dual use items to COCOM participating countriesand countries determined to have sufficient export control systems to warrantthe benefit under section 5(k) of the EAA. A proposed new Supplement No.2 to Part 771 listed commodities that could be exported to the People'sRepublic of China with only notification to other COCOM governments asof the date of enactment of the Trade Act. In addition, the proposal wouldnot have authorized the use of the general license provision for exportsto entities that the exporter knows or has reason to know are controlled-in-factby Country Groups Q, W, Y, or Z. The Department received comments from 14 firms and associations. In general,the comments were opposed to the scope and limitation of the proposed GeneralLicense G-COCOM. Most commenters felt that creation of yet another general license was confusing,and that it was the intent of Congress to expand General License G-COMto allow exports of ``Green Zone'' commodities, not to create a new generallicense or restrict commodities to the ``PRC Green Zone'' as of August23, 1988. Commenters felt that the proposed General License G-COCOM willcause confusion in implementation. The final rule retains the proposedGeneral License G-COCOM structure of listing the eligible ``Green Zone''commodities, as of the date of enactment of the Trade Act, in SupplementNo. 2 to Part 771. However, the final rule adds four entries to the Supplementthat were erroneously omitted in the proposal and raises the maximum bittransfer rate of Disk Drives from 3 Mbytes/sec. to 6 Mbytes/sec. The proposed rule would not have made the general license provision availablewhen the exporter knows or has reason to know that the recipient is a personor entity controlled-in-fact by governments of Country Groups Q, W, Y,or Z. Many commenters expressed concern that other COCOM countries do nothave the same restriction and that these unilateral controls placed anunfair advantage on U.S. competitiveness. This final rule removes the restrictionin its entirety.A number of commenters noted that the restriction to consumption withineligible countries would prevent shipments for inventory, where ultimateuse was not yet established. The final rule allows shipment under G-COCOMwhere the goods might be reexported under other authorization. Some commenters observed that the Act addressed ``goods and technology''while the proposal dealt only with goods. BXA is revising the technicaldata regulations and will address the Trade Act revisions in that separatedocument. In addition, the proposed rule specified Switzerland as the only non-COCOMcountry eligible to benefit from General License G-COCOM. Many commentersquestioned why only Switzerland was included; they believed that Congressintended to include other countries for eligibility. The EAA provided forthe exercise of judgment as to whether a country's export controls arecomparable in practice to those of COCOM participating countries. The Departmentof Commerce can also treat a country like a COCOM participating countryin some or all respects under the EAR without having determined that thecountry's export controls are fully comparable in practice to the COCOMsystem. Because of continued improvement in its export controls, this finalrule adds Finland on this discretionary basis as a country to which thisGeneral License provision will apply. Possible extension to other countrieswill be considered. Export license applications do not generally specify whether the goodsare within advisory notes or not. Thus, the Department has no statisticalbasis for determining how many individual validated license applicationswill be eliminated as a result of this new general license. However, weexpect a sharp decrease in applications because G-COCOM covers a broadrange of goods destined to the major markets for U.S. exporters. <ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements </ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661. 2. This rule does not contain a collection of information subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). As a result of this rule, a reduction of paperwork burdenon the public is anticipated. Affected OMB controlled collection actionsinclude 0694-0005, 0694-0007, and 0694-0010. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Nevertheless, to helpascertain the economic impact of the regulation upon the general public,the regulation was issued in proposed form and public comment was solicited.Because this rule was originally issued in proposed form it complies withsection 13(b) of the Export Administration Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Parts 771, 774, and 786</ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, Parts 771, 774, and 786 of the Export Administration Regulations(15 CFR Parts 768-799) are amended as follows: 1.
