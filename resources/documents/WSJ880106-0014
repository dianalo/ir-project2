Central banks aggressively bought dollars, helping wipe out losses that the dollar incurred in a post-Christmas 1987 sell-off. Some traders said the blitz of official buying touched off new short-term market bullishness about the U.S. currency. Still, analysts and economists said the dollar faces formidable obstacles to any sustained rise.    Stock and bond prices climbed as well yesterday, as traders were heartened by the dollar's rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 16.25 points to 2031.50, while prices of 30-year Treasury bonds rose more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount. The Dow industrials finished at their highest level since before the Oct. 19 stock market crash.    The dollar declined from its opening in early trading in Tokyo Wednesday. At midmorning, the dollar was quoted at 127.30 yen, down from 128.20 yen at the opening, but up from 124.80 yen at the end of yesterday's trading. The dollar's decline was checked by intervention by the Bank of Japan, traders said.    The dollar began rising Tuesday from the start of Asian trading, boosted by reports of as much as $1 billion of Bank of Japan intervention and by the strength of the rally in U.S. markets Monday. It got a further big lift when New York trading opened and traders said the U.S. Federal Reserve was actively buying dollars. The Fed and the Bank of Japan declined to comment on their activities.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 127.60 yen, compared with 122.98 late Monday, and 1.6295 marks, compared with 1.5880 a day earlier. The British pound eased 2.6% to $1.8265 from $1.8745, and the dollar advanced 3.1% against the Swiss franc to 1.3290 from 1.2885.    The dollar's gain against the yen was believed to its biggest one-day rise in percentage terms in the past several years. Traders attributed some of the force of its move to a change in the central banks' intervention tactics. Both the Fed and the Bank of Japan, they said, stepped into the market when the dollar wasn't under selling pressure. This indicated they wanted to move the currency higher, traders said, rather than merely prevent a further decline.    &quot;The fact that the Fed came in with the dollar as high as it was caused a shift in sentiment,&quot; said Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at European American Bank in New York. The dollar already had gained about 1.5% against the mark and 2% against the yen in Asian and European trading when the Fed was first reported to be buying dollars early in the New York day.    Estimates varied widely on how much the Fed spent in its intervention, but traders agreed that it was less than the Bank of Japan's $1 billion. Some estimated total world-wide central bank buying at $2 billion, and others said it was less than Monday's estimated $1.75 billion.    In addition to the Fed and Japanese central bank's reported actions, the West German Bundesbank confirmed that it bought dollars in the open market but didn't indicate the amount, and small amounts of buying by the Bank of Canada and the Austrian central bank were reported.    Foreign exchange market activity, meanwhile, was reported to be very heavy until about midday in New York. The dollar eased slightly around that time, then continued drifting upward as the trading pace slowed.    The easing came shortly after White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, in response to a reporter's question, that the dollar &quot;appears to have stabilized today.&quot; The remark, however, was understood to be an extemporaneous comment and not a policy statement that the Reagan administration wanted the currency's new upward course to flatten out.    The dollar resumed its rise late in the New York day and opened at 128.23 yen in Australian trading Wednesday.    Gary Dorsch, senior money market analyst at LNS Financial Group Inc., Chicago, said the mood in the market &quot;has changed 180 degrees&quot; to a feeling that the dollar is oversold and the central banks have &quot;constructed a strong wall of defense&quot; through their market intervention.    He said currency-price charts used by technical traders indicate the dollar will strengthen substantially over the next two weeks to the range of 135 to 140 yen and about 1.70 marks. He cited large-scale liquidations of foreign currency positions in the market and said: &quot;The world is short of dollars; an interim bottom (for the dollar's value) appears to have been reached.&quot;    In the longer term, however, &quot;There isn't any current belief out there that the dollar is going to go up over time,&quot; Robert H. Chandross, vice president and chief economist in New York for Britain's Lloyds Bank PLC, said.    The central banks probably could continue their intervention until the U.S. announces its November merchandise trade figures on Jan. 15, he said. But the consensus estimate, he said, is that the U.S. ran a trade deficit of $15 billion or more in November, and any deficit of more than $14 billion for the month would be negative news for the dollar.    He said the U.S. unemployment figures that will be released Friday also might create downward pressure on the currency. An increase of more than 175,000 in non-farm employment, he said, would indicate a relatively robust economy -- but also would be a sign that demand for imports will remain strong, complicating the task of narrowing the trade deficit.    Despite the magnitude of the dollar's gain yesterday, several traders said it looked more like a technical rebound than a major advance.    Mr. Ryan of European American Bank said the currency was &quot;fundamentally ripe for a correction&quot; after its late-1987 slide. It declined more than five yen in the final five trading sessions of the year. Yesterday's gains brought it back to the levels it held around Dec. 15 against most other major currencies.    Rony Schlapfer, chairman of Capital Management International, a New York-based money management concern, said there wasn't any &quot;remarkable new inflow of funds&quot; yesterday. He said much of the activity consisted of central bank buying and covering of short, or oversold, dollar positions.    The dollar's steep rise yesterday, meanwhile, was more than matched by the Canadian dollar, which ended the day slighter stronger at 77.46 cents.    Bryan Griffiths, senior vice president, foreign exchange, for Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, said traders sometimes use the Canadian currency to extend their U.S. dollar positions. But he and other traders also cited strong recent economic growth in Canada and said there was strong commercial interest in the currency yesterday.    Separately, the Bank of France cut two benchmark interest rates a quarter-point yesterday, reducing its money market intervention rate to 7 1/2% and its seven-day securities repurchase rate to 8%. The French Economics Ministry said the move was made after consultation with other central banks. It said this illustrates the cooperation that has developed among European central banks since the October stock market crash.
