Congress has been debating creation of such a fund for 15 years,but supporters said the effort received little attention until thetanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in March, dumping 11 milliongallons of oil into the pristine waters off Alaska.   Skinner outlined the administration's proposal at acongressional hearing during which he noted that the federalgovernment at the time of the Alaska spill had only a few milliondollars available specifically for cleanup efforts.

Criminals ``think threatening the judge will solve theproblem,'' said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service.   ``It kind of goes with the turf, unfortunately,'' said OlmstedCounty District Judge Gerard Ring, who received several deaththreats last year after a controversial ruling in the case of ayouthful ax murder suspect.   ``I don't think there's been a judge who's been on the benchmore than a couple years who hasn't had some threats or harassmentof some kind,'' said Anoka County District Judge Lynn Olson.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rhunetta Crumel is one person who thinks AvonProducts Inc. should not be fighting so hard against Amway Corp.'soffer to buy it for more than $2 billion.
