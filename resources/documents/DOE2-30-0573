Datawere collected from telephone interviews conducted in eight cities acrossCanada. Some highlights of the survey findings are as follows. Thereis a decreasing consciousness of the problems and implications of theenergy situation compared with earlier surveys. 41% of respondents believethat the energy crisis is a hoax. The energy shortage ranked last inimportance among six selected issues facing Canadians. Shortages of specificfuels were seen at two levels of concern: gasoline and heating oil athigh concern, electricity and natural gas at about half that level. Nearly30% favored increasing gasoline prices to world levels; such an increasewould change gasoline-related habits. A series of possible energy savingactions showed varying levels of support, e.g. 57% for a tax on gas-heavycars. Certain conservation practices have become common, such as lowthermostat settings and regular furnace servicing. 30% of those usingoil heat gave serious thought to switching to another fuel, and thereis also evidence to show actual switching. 119 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
