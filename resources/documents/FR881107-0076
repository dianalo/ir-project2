Box 1369, Nome, Alaska 99762 has filed a petitionto modify the application of 30 CFR 56.9003 (mobile equipment brakes) toits Anvil Mine (I.D. No. 50-01452) located in Seward Peninsula, Alaska.The petition is filed under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety andHealth Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that powered mobile equipmentbe provided with adequate brakes.2. Petitioner operates a Caterpillar 631B to haul coarse tailings awayfrom the screening plant, and Terex scrapers to haul fine supersaturatedtailings from the plant and raw materials to the plant for sizing and segregation.The scrapers operate 75% of the time in wet, soft, and muddy conditions.The materials are deleterious in nature and become unstable and unsupportivewhen wet and worked.3. Due to continuous operation of the equipment under these types of conditions,application of the standard would result in a diminution of safety.4. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes that operators would travelwith the scraper bowl slightly above the ground surface and have one handready to drop the scraper bowl to the ground at all times in the case ofdeceleration on a grade or in the case of an emergency stop.5. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
