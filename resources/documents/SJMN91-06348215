Donal Keohanewas not the father of Vicki Long's 5-year-old daughter, LaDonna Michelle. Thejury also said the priest was not bound by a 1986 contract he signed agreeingto pay $350 a month in child support. Long, a Columbus resident whose affairwith Atlanta Archbishop Eugene Marino led to his resignation last year, filedsuit against Keohane in 1987. When 1988 blood tests showed he was not thefather, she amended the suit to say he must adhere to the contract anyway.Long's attorney tried to cast doubt on the validity of the blood tests. Healso said Keohane broke the contract when he stopped payments last year. ButKeohane's attorney told the jury Long was the one who broke the contract byfiling suit. The contract stated that Keohane would provide child support ifshe kept her paternity charges secret.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PRIEST SPARED FROM PAYING CHILD SUPPORT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  National News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911213  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  192  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 13, 199100348215,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
