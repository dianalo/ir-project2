He suggests theprocess of ethics investigations needs improvement.)   Maybe the whole process needs some change and clarification. ...Maybe the committee that is currently required to sit as a kind ofgrand jury and petit jury both, ought to have a differentcomposition. ... Maybe once a report of alleged violations isissued, the committee rules ought to allow the member to respondexpeditiously.   You know, to deny a member the opportunity to reply quickly cancause serious political injury. It is unfair. ... In my case, forexample, the committee has yet to release any witness testimony ordocuments that it obtained during the investigation. ...   Perhaps we want to consider outright abolition of all honoraria,speaking fees, altogether. ... In exchange for a straightforward,honest increase in the salary for members of all three branches ofthe government.   It is intolerably hurtful to our government that qualifiedmembers of the executive and legislative branches are resigningbecause of ambiguities and confusion surrounding the ethics laws,and because of their own consequent vulnerability to personalattack.   That's a shame.   It's happening.   And it is grievously hurtful to our society.   When vilification becomes an accepted form of political debate,when negative campaigning becomes a fulltime occupation, whenmembers of each party become self-appointed vigilantes carrying outpersonal vendettas against members of the other party, in God'sname that is not what this institution is supposed to be all about.   When vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication, harshpersonal attacks upon one another's motives and one another'scharacter drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on importantissues, things that we ought to be involved ourselves in, surelythat is unworthy of our institution, unworthy of our Americanpolitical process.   All of us, in both political parties, must resolve to bring thisperiod of mindless cannibalism to an end.   There has been enough of it. ...   When I first came here all those years ago in 1955 this was aplace where a man's word was his bond and his honor and truth ofwhat he said to you were assumed. You didn't have to prove it. ...   Now, we need that.   Have I made mistakes?   Oh, boy, how many!   I made a lot of mistakes.   Mistakes in judgment, oh, yeah.   A lot of them.   I'll make some more. ...   Have I contributed unwittingly to this manic idea of a frenzy offeeding on other people's reputations?   Have I at all caused a lot of this?   So maybe I have. God, I hope I haven't, but maybe I have.   Have I been too partisan?   Too insistent?   Too abrasive?   Too determined to have my way?   Perhaps.   Maybe so.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
