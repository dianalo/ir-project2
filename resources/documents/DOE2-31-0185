One circumstance militating against automaticcontrol of heating and air systems is that these are designed for extremeconditions (e.g. lowest mean outdoor temperature) which are hardly everencountered in actual service. Microelectronics assumes great importancefor automation and information processing in building services. Withthe availability of efficient, low-cost microprocessors, it has becomepossible to make more use of modern control and optimization techniquesin heating and air conditioning. They have been applied on a broad basis,ranging from simple heating regulators through self-teaching controldevices to major, decentralized building automation systems. These automationand optimization systems are described.</TEXT></DOC>
