The State Department, which has estimated that there areabout 11,000 Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait, said yesterdaythat one more American and eight British citizens were seizedby Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait, reportedly after a Kuwaiti manwas forced at gunpoint to identify homes of Westerners. Thataction increased the number of Americans held hostage by Iraqto 54, according to the department.</LP><TEXT>   While it is difficult to confirm the whereabouts of theforeigners caught up in the crisis, several Americancompanies said their employees haven't been seized.   Asea Brown Boveri Inc., an engineering firm based inStamford, Conn., said it has about a half dozen Americanemployees in Kuwait and Iraq. None have left, and aspokeswoman said the company is in &quot;regular communication&quot;with them. Lockheed Corp., of Los Angeles, said it has threeAmerican employees still safe, at least as of earlier thisweek, when the company received a fax transmission that saidthey were safe and still in Kuwait.   Chevron Corp. said two of its chemical engineers weretrapped in Kuwait while working on a refinery near KuwaitCity. They haven't been heard from since the Aug. 2 Iraqiinvasion. The State Department told Chevron that the twoweren't among 28 Americans transported to Baghdad.   Turner International Inc., an international generalcontractor based in New York, has several employees at largein Kuwait, and the company was indirectly in contact withthem as late as Saturday. &quot;We heard that they were OK andthey were laying low,&quot; said Nick Billotti, the company'sdirector of international business. &quot;They are keeping a verylow profile.&quot;   It is hard to estimate how many Americans remain inKuwait, partly because the State Department seems to beadvising most American companies to make no publicacknowledgment of any operations or employees in thatcountry. For instance, Raytheon Co., Lexington, Mass., won'teven confirm the existence of its Raytheon Gulf Systems Co.of Kuwait.   &quot;With the turbulent situation in the Middle East, we'renot going to talk about it,&quot; said Walter Palmer, head ofRaytheon's public relations.   Bechtel Group Inc., the giant San Francisco generalcontractor, is believed to be the largest American employerin the Middle East. While Bechtel won't say exactly how manyAmericans it employs in the region, it had 1,200 people ofall nationalities -- including dependents -- before theinvasion; that number has been reduced to about 900currently. The company hasn't had offices in either Iraq orKuwait for at least a year, but it declined to say whetherany of its workers were in the two countries when theinvasion took place. A spokesman would only say: &quot;We're incontact with all of our people.&quot;   Another big contractor, Ralph M. Parsons Co., Pasadena,Calif., has 12 employees and eight of their relatives inKuwait. They were working on a waste-water treatment plant, apower plant and highways. As of last week, they were believedto be safely out of Iraqi hands.   So far, the company with the largest contingent held byIraq is Santa Fe International Inc., the big oil drilling andrig equipment operator. Eight of its oil field workers weretaken to Baghdad from Kuwait after the invasion, and thecompany hasn't had contact with them since.   Relatives of the Americans in Kuwait, while all anguished,are divided over whether their predicament should determilitary action by the U.S. &quot;Providing the Americans are out,I would be for it, but my son is in Kuwait City,&quot; said EmilyAbramson of Southbury, Conn., whose son is an architectworking for a private Kuwaiti firm. She opposes militaryaction until all Americans are out of Kuwait. The StateDepartment told her that as of Aug. 16 her son was stillfree.   The Rev. Edwin Davis of Koran, La., whose daughter and twograndchildren were trapped in Kuwait while visiting in-laws,said, &quot;I'd hate for {the U.S.} to start something and I don'tthink they will.&quot; He hasn't heard from his daughter sinceAug. 2. If the Americans could be evacuated, &quot;I wouldn'tcare, let 'em fight. Let 'em clean that bunch out.&quot;   Betty Seago, whose husband, Guy, maintains radar equipmentfor the Kuwaitis, said, &quot;I stand behind the government. Ofcourse you love your family and all, but I would have tostand behind it. It's not in my hands.&quot; Mr. Seago'swhereabouts are unknown.</TEXT></DOC>
