Bush's national edge over Dole narrows slightly to 39%-31% among likely GOP voters in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, but he remains over 20 points ahead in the Southern Super Tuesday states. Bush's rating on toughness jumps sharply to 64% positive after his run-in with TV's Dan Rather. A majority still think Bush hasn't given a full accounting of his Iran-Contra role, but fewer consider it a key issue.    Dukakis soars to a 29% to 17% lead over Gephardt among Democrats. Even among white Southerners, Dukakis leads with 26%, as Gore and Gephardt vie for second with this group. Among likely Democratic voters, 61% say Dukakis's experience as Massachusetts governor qualifies him to be an effective president. Jackson slips a bit, and Gore wins almost no support outside the South.    But Democrats in the poll, by 54% to 40%, say they aren't satisfied with the current crop of candidates.    CHANCES ARE DIM for reviving Mideast peace talks, U.S. officials concede.    The hope is to prod Israeli's Shamir into dropping his objections to the U.S. peace plan. But Shamir is likely to play for time by demanding changes. Israel's hard-liners may believe U.S. pressure will backfire and help them in this November's Israeli election. Some may hope Reagan will be succeeded by a Democrat even less willing to push for Israeli concessions.    Shamir will be pressed for a response when he visits Washington later this month. Meanwhile, the U.S. quietly tries to persuade former Israeli Defense Minister Sharon not to undercut Shamir by attacking the peace effort. Despite pessimism about getting talks started, one U.S. official says, Reagan has to make one more try &quot;for the history books.&quot;    GREENSPAN WINS mostly cheers so far as Fed chief, but tests lie ahead.    Lawmakers say he is more candid than his predecessor Volcker was. Democratic Sen. Chiles applauds him for successfully riding &quot;the giant slalom&quot; of the stock market and the dollar over the past six months. A Merrill Lynch economist calls it a &quot;virtuoso&quot; performance.    Greenspan avoids splits at the Fed so far after courting outspoken member Angell and Vice Chairman Johnson. But some regional Fed-bank presidents complain the chairman didn't consult them in his January move to lower rates. And Senate Banking Chairman Proxmire warns that Republican Greenspan's performance during the presidential election year &quot;will be closely scrutinized.&quot;    A key test could come if increased inflation worries put pressure on the Fed to push up interest rates.    BUSH'S ELECTABILITY worries Republicans as he falls behind Democrats in some surveys. The recent Field poll shows Bush now trailing Dukakis by nine points and Gephardt by five points in California, a slide of more than 20 points in only three months. &quot;George's ability to win a general election depends on the Democrats screwing up,&quot; a GOP strategist frets.    DUKAKIS'S DOUGH pours in at a rate of $1 million a month, for a total exceeding $19 million; he raised $132,000 this week at a largely Greek-American event in the unlikely setting of Williamsburg, Va. Gephardt's money flow rises, but rivals are skeptical of his claim that he raised $500,000 in one day.    AMBIVALENT VOTERS: In the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters by a 58%-35% margin say the next president should change direction rather than follow Reagan's policies. But by a narrow 39%-36%, voters think it would be better to have a Republican as the next president.    COZY COUNSELS: Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh sent a congratulatory note to Independent Counsel James McKay after McKay won conviction of former White House aide Nofziger. And McKay has agreed to share with Walsh some Justice Department documents that the Iran-Contra prosecutor didn't have.    SESSIONS'S START as FBI chief gets off at a slow pace.    The new director acknowledges that he doesn't know the details of sharp White House cuts in the FBI's initial 1989 budget request for anti-drug programs. He says he doesn't know which U.S. agencies collected intelligence about drug-running by Panama's Noriega. And he says, &quot;I don't know if I have access to the president.&quot;    After three months on the job, Sessions says his agenda is just &quot;beginning to develop.&quot; He has indicated that priorities would include bank-fraud enforcement and tightening FBI procedures for undercover probes. Critics say that under his cautious approach, the FBI failed to defend itself quickly enough against recent allegations of politically motivated investigations.    Sessions aides say the former judge is moving methodically to avoid mistakes and to reassure lawmakers.    MINOR MEMOS: Fruitful skies: The Bush campaign bills reporters $3,400 each for two days' travel, double what the commercial first-class air fare would have been. . . . William DeGregorio, author of a book on presidents, puns: &quot;The Democrats Polked us in 1844. They Pierced us in 1852. Will we be Gored in 1988?&quot; . . . Psychologists for Social Responsibility urges presidential candidates to &quot;avoid cheap but really harmful appeals to exaggerated enemy images.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
