Homeowners in the U.S. are more likely than renters tohave washers, dryers, dishwashers, and even telephones,according to a new housing survey from the Census Bureau.Refrigerators and stoves are virtually universal for bothowners and renters. But only 86% of renters have a phone,compared with 97% of owners. Homeowners are more than twiceas likely as renters to have washers, 93% vs. 42%.Eighty-four percent have dryers, compared with 33% ofrenters. Over half -- 55% -- have dishwashers, compared with31% of renters.   Homeowners have more money to buy such things. They alsohave more room for them. Nearly half -- 47% -- of homeownershave a separate dining room, compared with 24% of renters.Forty-three percent have two or more living or recreationrooms, compared with just 9% of renters. To keep this spacecomfortable, owners are more likely to have air conditioningand fireplaces.   Owners also are more likely to have outdoor space. Fully83% of homeowners have a porch, deck, patio, or balcony,compared with 61% of renters. Seventy-two percent have agarage or carport, compared with 29% of renters.   When it comes to waste, however, renters are nearly tiedwith owners. Thirty-six percent of renters have a disposal intheir kitchen sink, close to the 38% share of homeowners.                                                                                                          Travel Paths Diverge   With Older Americans                                                                                                          EVERYONE KNOWS that the retired are a good travel market.But there are different travel segments within the olderpopulation.   A new study from New York-based Mediamark Research foundthat 52% of adults aged 55 and older took a domestic trip of200 miles or more in the past year, close to the average forall adults. They make up 26% of the total adult travelmarket.   Most mature Americans are retired, which means they havethe time to take longer trips. They are 10% more likely thanthe average adult to go away for one to two weeks, and 50%more likely to go away for more than two weeks.   Many of those aged 55 to 59 still work, and they dominatethe short-trip market. Forty-four percent went away for aweek or less, compared with 35% of all older Americans.People 60 to 64 dominate midlength trips. Seventeen percentwere away for one to two weeks, compared with 14% of allolder Americans. Ten percent of those 65 to 69 were away formore than two weeks, compared with less than 9% of all matureAmericans.   The younger segment of the older market is more likely totravel than the older segment, probably because they havemore money and better health. Twenty-one percent of thoseaged 55 to 64 took at least one trip outside the continentalU.S. in the past year, compared with 18% of all matureAmericans.   There is something of an age limit to traveling. Thoseaged 75 and older are less likely than average to travel.Even so, 41% of these oldest Americans took a domestic tripin the past year, and a vigorous 12% went abroad.                                                                                                          One Roof Overhead,   Separate Costs Below                                                                                                          THE OLD SAYING that two can live as cheaply as one is aslight exaggeration. In fact, two-person households spend 68%more than one-person households, according to a 1988 Bureauof Labor Statistics survey.   It's true that some expenses are more economical whenshared. Two-person households spend just 53% more thansingle-person households on housing. In dollar terms, thiscomes out to $4,074 per person, compared with $5,335 forone-person households. Two-person households spend only 48%more on clothing than single-person households; they spend$663 per person, compared with $893 for singles.   Two-person households spend twice as much as one-personhouseholds on health care and on personal insurance andpensions. They also have twice as many cars on average, andspend twice as much on transportation, $5,403 compared with$2,700.   Alcohol is the only major spending category for which theold adage is true. The average two-person household spent$278 on alcohol in 1988. So did the average single-personhousehold.                                                                                                          Middle Age at 26.1:   Hispanics Are Youngest                                                                                                          HISPANICS ARE the youngest population in the U.S., with amedian age of 26.1. New Census Bureau estimates for 1989 showthat fully 68% of Hispanics are under age 35, compared with54% of the general population. Only 5% of Hispanics are aged65 and older, compared with 12% of the total population.   Blacks are slightly older than Hispanics. Their median agein 1989 was 27.7. Sixty-three percent of blacks are under 35,and 8% are aged 65 and older. Asians and native Americans areslightly older than blacks, with a median age of 29. Some 61%are under 35, and 7% are 65 and older.   Whites are the oldest population group in the U.S., with amedian age of 33.6. Some 53% are under age 35, and another13% are aged 65 and older. Whites also have ahigher-than-average share of middle-aged people. Thirty-fourpercent of whites are aged 35 to 64, compared with 32% ofother races, 28% of blacks, and 27% of Hispanics.   The young median age of Hispanics is attributed to higherfertility and immigration rates. Blacks also have higherfertility rates than whites. Asians have higher immigrationrates.</TEXT></DOC>
