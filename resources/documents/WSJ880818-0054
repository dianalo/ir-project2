Unfortunately, however, in an apparent effort to clarify one of my remarks, an editorial change was made that distorted my intentions. At the end of my version of the first paragraph I stated: &quot;To be sure, there are occasionally lucky discoveries, but to expect that the disappearance of the U.S. government debt will be realized requires a tremendous dose of optimism.&quot;    Irving M.
