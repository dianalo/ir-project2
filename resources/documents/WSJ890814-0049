So much so, in fact, that the London Futures and Options Exchange is raising original margin deposits, or good-faith money, to #1,000 ($1,600) a contract from #400 ($640) beginning Aug. 17. A single contract contains 10 metric tons of cocoa. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.    That action led to a sharp drop in cocoa prices in London on Friday, followed by a lesser decline in New York. &quot;We are taking preventative action against the possibility of a major price movement,&quot; a London exchange official says. Both the exchange and its clearinghouse will continue to &quot;consult with individual members to ensure an orderly market,&quot; the official says. It might require additional margins from members with &quot;significant positions,&quot; he says.    The two trading firms -- Phibro-Salomon of New York and Cie. Financiere Sucres et Denrees, or Sucden, of Paris -- are controlling so much cocoa that they are virtually monopolizing the market, several London cocoa traders say. They contend that the increase in margins was necessary. The two firms could be in a position to corner or squeeze the London cocoa futures market, they say.    Both Phibro, a Salomon Inc. unit, and Sucden declined to comment on their positions and reasons for the deal.    The Ivory Coast announced that it intends to sell 500,000 metric tons of cocoa worth an estimated $665 million from the crop whose 1989-90 season will begin Oct. 1.    Sucden confirmed that it is purchasing 200,000 tons, while traders say Phibro is buying the remaining 300,000 tons. Further details of an intricate plan to buy the cocoa at prices of 8,500 francs ($1,332) a ton or higher, are expected to be announced soon, dealers say.    Even after Friday's fall, London December cocoa futures prices at #925 ($1,467) a metric ton are 22% higher than their lows in May.    In London the December 1989 contract alone has an open position of 40,000 contracts, the exchange says, while the total open futures position until December 1990 is 119,393 contracts, equivalent to nearly half annual world output. Open positions are contracts that remain to be liquidated by either an opposite trade or delivery of the commodity.    A year ago the total open position in London was 48,000 contracts, about the same level as New York's present open position of around 49,170 contracts.    The bulk of the London positions, particularly those that mature in December, are controlled by Phibro and Sucden, dealers say. &quot;So much of the world's biggest producer's cocoa is controlled by just two trading companies that markets are naturally sensitive to the size of open futures positions,&quot; says James Fry, a director of Landell Mills Commodities Studies.    Over and above the latest sale, Sucden bought 200,000 tons of cocoa from the Ivory Coast earlier this year and is storing a further 200,000 tons for the producer, dealers say. Phibro purchased 280,000 tons from the Ivory Coast about two months ago.    So the total amount of cocoa controlled by the two merchants is nearly 1.2 million tons, dealers say, although by now the firms may have sold some of it.    Ivory Coast cocoa output this season is estimated at 780,000 tons, or a third of Western production, estimates the Gill andamp; Duffus Group, a London commodity merchant.    &quot;The two companies are propping up the market,&quot; says Donald Spence, an analyst at E.D.andamp;F Man International. Yet there is a &quot;horrendous surplus,&quot; he says, so eventually prices will fall again.    World cocoa production has exceeded consumption for five years running, says Gill andamp; Duffus. This season's output of 2.4 million tons could exceed consumption by 309,000 tons, raising the world cocoa stockpile to 1.1 million tons, the firm says. This is equivalent to about six months demand.    A lengthy study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, &quot;Cocoa, a Commodity in Crisis,&quot; says that &quot;a boom in prices is out of the question.&quot; Instead, cocoa prices are likely to slump in the next four years. The commodity has been in a long-term decline since it peaked at $5,467 a metric ton in 1977, the study says.    But the glut of cocoa shouldn't be examined at face value, a London dealer cautions. A large proportion of the cocoa is poor quality. Chocolate manufacturers generally favor supplies from the Ivory Coast and other West African nations, so the market in &quot;desirable cocoa is tight,&quot; he says.    Sucden and Phibro hold the key to the market, says Brenda Sullivan, analyst at GNI Ltd., London commodity brokers. &quot;If they refrain from selling prices will rise; if they don't, the bears will be right.&quot;    Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:    Energy    This week should determine whether last week's oil-price rally was a flash in the pan or signaled an end to the recent slide in petroleum prices. Despite two days of brisk gains last week, many oil traders and analysts look for further weakening soon. Their reasoning is that the industry's supply fundamentals are negative because of higher OPEC production than had been expected. They say these excess supplies will show up in inventories soon.    So far, U.S. and Pacific-area oil markets appear to be balanced, according to Energy Security Analysis, which monitors oil supplies world-wide. But the Washington firm reports a buildup of 10 million barrels in crude oil inventories in Europe in July. Its analysts say they remain &quot;neutral to modestly bearish&quot; on the price outlook.    Views of other traders and analysts are mixed. Some said it's a toss-up whether oil prices will go up or down over the days ahead. &quot;There may be a little weakness in the fundamentals, but there is some strength technically,&quot; said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp.    From a technical point of view, last week's price action for the West Texas Intermediate crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange was &quot;very constructive,&quot; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, senior vice president, futures investments, for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He said $18.30 a barrel was an &quot;important number&quot; for the September contract, and he noted there were &quot;two back-to-back settlements&quot; above that price last week. Even though the futures price of September West Texas crude declined 11 cents a barrel Friday to settle at $18.48, he said the near-month crude contract &quot;should be going up to test $19.65 or $19.75 over the next week or so.&quot;    Grains and Soybeans    Traders this week will focus on fallout from the government's Thursday report that projected less of a rebound in corn production than had been widely forecast by analysts.    The price of several corn futures contracts Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade rose their daily permissible limit of 10 cents a bushel. The Agriculture Department forecast a 49% jump in corn production instead of the 53% jump widely predicted by market analysts from the drought-stunted 1988 harvest of 4.92 billion bushels of corn.    Traders this week will also watch for any corroboration of a rumor that the Soviet Union is interested in buying between 500,000 metric tons and one million metric tons of U.S. corn. Many traders are skeptical.    The weather will continue to be a hot topic because of lingering dry conditions in parts of the western Corn Belt states.    Orange Juice    Traders this week can expect a continuation of Friday's price decline, which followed the sudden upward spike last Thursday.    For some time there has been concern over whether there are enough supplies of the concentrate to deliver against the September future, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. The first notices to deliver the juice against September contracts will be issued Sept. 1.    Brazilian new-crop concentrate usually begins arriving in the U.S. in July, but the Brazilian 1989-90 orange crop's development was delayed by drought last fall and it is now thought that shipments won't begin to arrive in the U.S. until late October, according to Ms. Ganes.    &quot;It is the doubt about whether there are enough domestic supplies to cover this time gap that is creating the concern,&quot; said Ms. Ganes. &quot;However, supplies should be ample to meet exchange delivery commitments.&quot;    Thereafter, Ms. Ganes notes, the concern will be that supplies will be more than ample. Brazilian sources are estimating that country's orange harvest at a record 290 million boxes. That would be 40% higher than last season's 210 million boxes and top the record of 239 million boxes in 1985-86. A box weighs 90 pounds.    Moreover, Ms. Ganes said, demand has turned sluggish, which has contributed to recent price declines.    Sugar    A drop in Brazilian sugar output helped sugar prices rise sharply Friday and may continue to be a supporting factor this week. The October delivery contract rose 0.57 cent a pound to 14.42 cents.    A report from a prominent Brazilian trade house said that Brazilian sugar production during the three months ended in July amounted to 1.6 million tons, compared with 2.4 million tons during the same period last year. Increasing demand for sugar and alcohol in Brazil is raising concern about Brazilian sugar supplies, according to the report, an analyst said. Brazil is a major exporting country.    In addition, the analyst said, Morocco is expected to buy as much as 150,000 tons of sugar this week, and it is still anticipated that India will be a major buyer.    Copper    If the host of actual or potential production-threatening problems aren't soon solved, traders can look for another week of price advances.    On Friday, prices shot up 4.75 cents a pound in the September contract as technically oriented traders were aggressive buyers. The advance was accelerated when the September future rose above $1.14 after three failed attempts, and then above the longer-term resistance level of $1.15.    Major price-supporting factors, an analyst said, were the continuing strike at Highland Valley mines in British Columbia, which began July 9, and the Peruvian national miners' strike that was to have begun today. &quot;The Highland Valley strike, especially, has gone on longer than expected,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
