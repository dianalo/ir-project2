Officials estimate 70 percent of their events are free _including a forum for high school students, a children's festivaland a public White House welcome that will constitute George Bush'sfirst official act as president.   Those events cost money and don't bring in any, but they're a keyelement in an inaugural schedule designed to foster inclusivenessand family feeling, say top officials of the Presidential InauguralCommittee.   The free events _ plus inflation, 11 inaugural balls and theusual galas and glitz _ are driving Bush inaugural costs to the $25million range. By comparison, President Reagan's 1981 and 1985inaugurals cost $15.5 million and $20 million, respectively.   Most of the money is raised privately and all of it is beingtightly monitored, according to those who hold the purse strings atBush inaugural headquarters.   ``We are extremely cost-conscious,'' said Stephen Studdert,executive director of the inaugural committee. ``We try and bideverything that can be bid. We try to get the best bang for thebuck. The dollars are not being spent for gold and glitter. They arebeing spent on substantive things.''   Bush himself said Thursday that he is ``not entirely''comfortable with the cost of his inauguration. But he added that ``Ihave no apologies for the way we're doing it at all'' because thecountry deserves a celebration every four years.   Asked at an inaugural news briefing whether the $25 millionwouldn't be better spent on the homeless, Stephen M. Studdert,executive director of the inaugural committee, said the inaugurationrepresented the strength and continuity of American democracy andthe peaceful transfer of power and was ``worthy of celebration.''   The inaugural committee raised $20 million in interest-free loansfrom 200 corporations who advanced $100,000 each. The money will berepaid from various sources, most of it from the yet-undeterminedtake from ticket sales.   Other anticipated revenues include about $1.5 million from saleof commemorative items, some $2 million from sale of tickets andadvertising time associated with a televised Kennedy Center gala,and an estimated $2 million in in-kind contributions and corporateand individual sponsorships.   Asked about the appearance of corporations trying to curry favorwith the new administration, Studdert said, ``The transition teamhas no idea who has supported the inauguration.''   The committee does not have to disclose its finances. However, ithas decided to publish a list of corporate lenders, in-kindcontributors, and corporations and individuals underwritingparticular aspects of the inauguration. Reminded of this, Studdertreplied, ``We're not distributing copies of it specifically topresidential personnel or anything.''   Even with millions flowing in from sales and contributors,taxpayers aren't entirely off the hook.   First, there's the creamy pumpkin-colored building the federalgovernment's General Services Administration turned over toinaugural committee for its headquarters. Set in the middle of anavy yard in an industrial section of Washington, the building hadbeen used to store machine guns. It has been converted with acombination of inaugural committee and GSA funds, Studdert said.   Other parts of the inauguration also are being paid by taxpayers.For example, Congress appropriated $750,000 to the JointCongressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to take care of theactual swearing-in ceremony and a luncheon to follow.   Congress also earmarked $2.5 million as the operating budget forthe Armed Forces Inaugural Committee, which currently counts 1,294people at its headquarters and expects to swell to 1,500 at theinaugural peak.   The military also expects to contribute 8,500 people duringinaugural week to march in the parade, drive dignitaries toinaugural-related events and serve in other capacities.   Congress tried to stem the government cost of such services lastyear by directing the Pentagon to seek reimbursement for allpersonnel participation in non-public events, but the provision isnot legally binding and is unlikely to have dramatic impact thistime around.</TEXT></DOC>
