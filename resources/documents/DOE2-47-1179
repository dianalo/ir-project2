Current waste disposalfacilities are exceeding their capacities and increasingly stringentdisposal requirements dictate the need for the sites and new waste disposaltechnologies. The Low-Level Waste Disposal Development and DemonstrationProgram has developed a strategy for low-level waste disposal built arounda dose based approach. This approach emphasizes contamination pathways,including surface and groundwater and ALARA conditions for workers. Thisstrategy dictates the types of data needed for this data package. Thedata package provides information on geology, soils, groundwater, surfacewater, and ecological characterization of the Oak Ridge Reservation inorder to evaluate alternative technologies and alternative sites. Theresults of the investigations and data collections indicate that differenttechnologies will probably have to be used at different sites. This conclusion,however, depends on the findings of the Environmental Impact Statement.14 figs., 19 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
