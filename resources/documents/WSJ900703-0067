During the session the price of some soybean contractsrose by their daily limit of 30 cents a bushel. Profit-takinglate in the session trimmed gains. Nevertheless, the wildrally signals just how skittish the grain industry is gettingabout prospects for the soybean crop.</LP><TEXT>   Most crop analysts don't foresee that much damage fromthis heat wave, which might last for roughly a week in theimportant soybean-growing areas of the delta. The soybeancrop there doesn't reach its vulnerable flowering stage formany weeks. The unusually wet spring gave much of the U.S.crop ample -- if not excessive -- soil moisture on which todraw.   But analysts are edgy because the government surprisedthem last week when it lowered its three-month-old estimateof planted soybean acreage by 1.4 million acres to 58 millionacres. Most analysts had thought the government was going toraise its estimate.   &quot;I don't think the weather will be that much of aproblem,&quot; said Steve Freed, senior grain analyst at DeanWitter Reynolds, Chicago. &quot;But we have low acres and stoutdemand&quot; for soybeans.   At the same time, the spate of hot weather is rekindlinginterest in forecasts by a few private meteorologists thatthe soupy spring will be followed by a hot and dry summer.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday thesoybean contract for July delivery rose 22.5 cents a bushelto settle at $6.46 a bushel.   The prices of corn futures contracts rose slightly totouch new life-of-contract highs during part of the tradingsession. Hot weather is expected to brush the Midwest for afew days. Temperatures in parts of Iowa, for example, areexpected to approach 100 degrees Fahrenheit today.   After the close of trading, the National Weather Servicereleased a six- to 10-day forecast calling for above-normaltemperatures throughout much of the Midwest.   Crop condition reports released by the major farm stateslate yesterday show that the corn and soybean crops are inrelatively good condition despite the cool and wet plantingseason.   In Iowa, 60% of the soybean crop is in excellent or goodcondition and 65% of the corn crop falls in that category.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices hit new session lows inlate trading yesterday and closed lower on the New YorkMercantile Exchange in light trading. Oil futures tradersfocused on the hour-to-hour developments of the strike by4,000 of Norway's oil workers that began late Saturday andshut down Norway's total crude oil output of 1,630,000barrels a day. The market opened higher on the chance thatstrikers might ignore the government's forced arbitrationorder. But the market fell as the government called on thestrikers to return to their jobs. The Norwegian Federation ofOil Workers Union central committee advised 4,000 strikingworkers to return to work because arbitration ordered by thegovernment earlier yesterday is legally binding. Afterfutures trading ended, the Norwegian oil workers' uniondisclosed that most of the workers won't obey theback-to-work order and that wildcat strikes are widespread.&quot;We have lost control of our members. Production in the NorthSea is completely stopped,&quot; said a union official, accordingto Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. In some cases,he said, the workers have blocked helicopter landing padswith cranes so new crews can't land. If the stoppagescontinue, prices are expected to rise today. Analystscaution, however, that it would take an extended strike towhittle down global inventory levels, which are currently atan eight-year high.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Prices closed strong with the October contractending 0.49 cent higher at 13.26 cents a pound. Sandra Kaul,tropical commodities analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in NewYork, said that Cargill Inc.'s taking delivery of more than400,000 tons of sugar on Friday showed that interest in thephysical market was more intense than had been perceivedearlier. &quot;There is some feeling in the trade that Cargillmight have done a deal with the Soviets for sugar,&quot; shenoted. Ms. Kaul also said that there isn't much sugarcurrently available, but there is plenty of uncertainty inBrazil concerning their export targets. She said Pakistan,Jordan and Syria have all announced that they will be cominginto the market soon to buy white, or refined, sugar. Shesaid tight supplies of white sugar will start influencingraw-sugar prices. Harry Schwartz, commodities specialist atCargill Investors Services, said he believes this rally haslimited potential. &quot;When prices get over 15 cents again Ibelieve that we will begin to lose&quot; some sales in thephysical market, as happened earlier this year.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices rose. The September contract gained$63 a ton to $1,309, $8 off the day's high. Mr. Schwartz ofCargill Investors Services said yesterday's price action waspuzzling to him because the Ivory Coast has been receivingmoisture at close to normal levels, and because summer isusually cocoa's slack period. &quot;I have to believe that this isnothing more than a technical rally,&quot; he said. Ms. Kaul fromShearson disagreed. She noted that chocolate manufacturershave established a large number of long hedges -- that is,they bought cocoa for future delivery between $1,000 and$1,200 a ton -- which in effect has established a band ofsupport for the market. Ms. Kaul also noted, &quot;There areperceptions that the French will reduce their commitment toWest Africa, the major cocoa growing region of the world,because of easing fears about the spread of world communism.&quot;She said such a perception could cause the cocoa industry toworry about political stability in the area. In addition, thefungus witches' broom has been spotted in Bahia, the largestcocoa-producing region in Brazil, the world's second largestproducer after the Ivory Coast. Ms. Kaul says this fungusdevastated cocoa production in the Amazon region of Brazil inthe 1950s. The country has taken many steps to ensure thatthe disease didn't spread, but apparently didn't completelysucceed. Ms. Kaul said there is no known cure for the fungus.She said the market could see the first effects of thedisease on the main Brazilian crop, which will begin to beharvested in October.</TEXT></DOC>
