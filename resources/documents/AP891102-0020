White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Wednesday reiteratedthe administration's position, with congressional Republicans instrong support, that the GOP was willing to live with the $16billion in automatic spending cuts which were ordered last monthunder the Gramm-Rudman law.   The cuts _ half from defense and half from domestic programs _were mandated because Congress and Bush have failed to agree onalternative ways of reducing the federal deficit.   ``We're prepared to go that route if that's what it takes to getsome leverage,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.   But Democrats said they felt politically confident ifRepublicans wanted to hold education grants, agriculture subsidies,national defense and a host of other popular programs hostage to acapital gains tax cut.   Republicans claim the tax cut, which Bush promised in hiscampaign, would be a boon to the economy. Democrats say it's agiveaway to the rich.   ``That's not a bad battleground for me. I'll take it,'' saidRep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the House majority whip. IfRepublicans want to cut programs for average Americans ``to providetax breaks for Donald Trump ... I'll be glad to debate that fromthe cornfields of Iowa to the bayous of Louisiana.''   The House has passed a plan to cut the tax rate on capitalgains, but it has been blocked in the Senate by a parliamentarymove led by Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.   The deadlock is holding up such matters as revising or repealingthe Medicare catastrophic illness plan and a much-needed bill toraise the government's debt limit.   If the Treasury isn't given new borrowing authority next week,it could be forced to default and bring major damage to thegovernment's world financial position.</TEXT></DOC>
