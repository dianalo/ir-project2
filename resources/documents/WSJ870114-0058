The Bank Board data also indicate that thrifts, prodded by regulators and new managers installed by the regulators, are continuing to take massive write-offs on real estate loans, mostly on commercial and apartment properties.    The Bank Board data, which is public but unreleased, make a distinction between &quot;current net income,&quot; which includes operating and nonoperating items booked in the quarter, and &quot;adjusted net income,&quot; which includes write-offs that the Bank Board believes should be attributed to earlier quarters.    Current net income of 3,234 federally insured savings and loan associations fell 94% in the quarter to $59 million from $1.04 billion a year earlier, according to the Bank Board data.    But the Bank Board reported adjustments to prior periods of a negative $469 million, resulting in an adjusted net loss of $410 million. A year earlier, the adjustment was a negative $295 million, resulting in net income of $743 million.    Current net income in the second quarter was $210 million, a drop of 88% from the year earlier, according to the Bank Board's most recent computer data. That represents a drop of more than $100 million from the $314 million of current net income reported in a Bank Board compilation in October.    In the second quarter, the adjustment to prior periods was a negative $569 million, resulting in an adjusted net loss of $358 million.    The sharp drop in current net income partly reflects much smaller gains from the sale of loans and mortgage-backed securities. Gains from such sales fell 28% to $1.3 billion in the third quarter from $1.8 billion in the second quarter.    And partly because of the large volume of refinancing of older, high-yielding fixed rate mortgages, thrifts' yield on loans has fallen faster than the rates they've had to pay to attract deposits. During the third quarter, thrifts' average yield on mortgages fell 0.31 percentage point, while their cost of funds fell only 0.22 percentage point.    But industry analysts said the lower current income figures also reflect some write-downs taken by thrifts on real estate loans. New regulations on classifying doubtful loans took effect early last year, and began to be reflected in industry results starting in the second quarter, said Dennis J. Jacobe, research director of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.    Most of the huge negative adjustments to prior-period results have been taken by thrifts that have been put into the Bank Board's management consignment program, said Richard Pickering, deputy director of the Bank Board's office of policy and economic research.    Because the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. doesn't have enough money to take over the biggest of the thrift industry's failures, the Bank Board has kept about 50 failed thrifts running under the program, but has ousted their former managements. The write-offs generally have been taken by the new managements.    &quot;As the people who are operating them get into the books of these failed institutions, they find there are some losses that should have been taken and they take them,&quot; Mr. Pickering said. &quot;These adjustments are from a relatively small number of institutions, they're just big,&quot; he added.    Mr. Jacobe said he believes that big write-downs of real estate loans continued in the fourth quarter, for which results aren't yet available. &quot;I hope that it's going to be over with by the end of the fourth quarter,&quot; he said.    At Sept. 30, the thrift industry's repossessed assets rose to $14.57 billion from $8.87 billion a year earlier and $13.17 billion at June 30. Loans foreclosed during the quarter were $3.81 billion, compared with $2.35 billion a year earlier and $3.24 billion in the second quarter.    Other Bank Board figures add evidence of the wide divergence of results within the industry. About 77% of the nation's thrifts were profitable in the third quarter, having a return on assets of 0.92%, down slightly from 1.03% in the second quarter.    The remaining 23%, however, had a return on assets of a negative 3.52%, slightly improved from a negative 4.13% return in the second quarter.    The problem thrifts are concentrated in Texas, the Northwest, the Midwest, California and the Southeast.    The Bank Board statistics also show that thrifts increased their portfolios of low-rated or unrated debt securities, known as &quot;junk bonds,&quot; to $7.23 billion at Sept. 30 from $7.17 billion a year earlier and $6.58 billion at June 30. </TEXT></DOC>
