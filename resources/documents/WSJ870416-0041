Companies in this sector use &quot;renewable&quot; energy sources, such as wood, water power, garbage, the sun and the Earth's internal warmth, to produce electricity and for heating and cooling. Some concerns also tap the &quot;alternative&quot; source of industrial waste heat.    Many of the companies grew out of federally subsidized programs in the 1970s that were intended to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. As the subsidies have dried up, institutions are starting to pick up the slack.    &quot;Institutional investors are awash in cash, and some are betting there'll be another energy crisis&quot; that will put renewable energy in the spotlight, says Scott Fenn, energy director of the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.    The center is a nonprofit provider of analytical services and is funded largely by institutional investors. It recently completed a study of their holdings in renewable-energy companies. Among the findings: Seven renewable-energy concerns have 20% or more of their common shares owned by institutions.    Even without another energy crisis, some think the renewable energy field has a bright long-term future. Many electric utilities predict they'll need additional generating capacity by the early 1990s. But they are reluctant to grapple with the vagaries of state utility regulation and commit themselves to building more of the familiar fossil-fuel or nuclear power plants.    Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette recently estimated that the renewable and alternative energy business could grow 20% to 40% a year in the next five to 10 years, generating total investments in the industry of $25 billion to $50 billion. That compares with $5 billion to $10 billion invested so far.    The outlook for the renewable energy business isn't the only lure for institutions. Dimensional Fund Advisers, a money manager based in Santa Monica, Calif., owns several such stocks simply because they fit into Dimensional's small-company portfolio made up of concerns with stock-market values of $10 million to $100 million.    Rex Sinquefield, Dimensional's co-chairman, says that smaller firms in general generate higher rates of return than larger firms, even after adjusting for increased risk. Dimensional, for example, currently owns 3% of Energy Factors, a San Diego company that designs and builds cogeneration plants. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and steam from a single fuel source, such as natural gas.    Richard Reiss is a big believer in the potential of hydropower in the Northeast. That's why, as managing director of Cumberland Associates, a New York investment management firm, he has acquired 9% of Consolidated Hydro of Stamford, Conn. Consolidated Hydro acquires, develops and operates small-scale hydroelectric plants in New England and New York state, selling the power to local utilities under long-term contracts. Mr. Reiss expects the region to be short of power by the 1990s, when many of Consolidated Hydro's contracts come up for renewal. &quot;It's a real growth area,&quot; he says.    Of course, there are risks in investing in renewable and alternative energy technologies. If there isn't a power shortage in the 1990s, there might be scant demand for electricity produced from renewable sources, especially if oil prices stay low. Many of the companies are still spending heavily on research and development. Many depend on just a handful of projects for revenue.    In addition to Consolidated Hydro, Donaldson Lufkin follows Catalyst Energy Development of New York. The company's engineering expertise cuts across several alternative-energy technologies, including cogeneration, hydro and geothermal energy. &quot;As a leading developer of those alternative-energy sources, Catalyst Energy appears to be in an extremely good position to benefit from the envisioned shortage of conventional electrical generating capacity,&quot; the securities firm says.    Mr. Fenn of the research center says recent breakthroughs in superconductivity research could make some renewable-energy firms more attractive. He says that if superconducting electrical wire can be perfected, solar and geothermal power plants, which often must be built far from population centers, could become more economical as their power could be transmitted more efficiently over long distances.    One company already making news in this area is Energy Conversion Devices, a Troy, Mich.-based solar energy concern, which last month announced that its scientists have developed a thin film of material that makes superconducting wire more economically feasible.    Another factor attracting interest to renewable-energy companies is the nationwide landfill crisis. Many cities have or are about to run out of garbage-dumping space, and thus they're turning to garbage-incineration plants that also generate electricity. Conversion Industries of Pasadena, Calif., is involved in one such big project, while O'Brien Energy Systems of Downingtown, Pa., has projects that recover methane gas from existing dumps. </TEXT></DOC>
