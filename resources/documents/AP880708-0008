In the strongest hint yet that the administration might supportcompensation for the destruction of the plane and the death of its290 occupants Sunday, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I suspectthat doing what we think is right will be the deciding factor.''   The comment came amid revelations that two Iranians triedunsuccessfully several times to open a diplomatic dialogue betweenTehran and Washington in recent months.   Fitzwater emphasized that the compensation matter is under staffreview and has not yet even gone to senior advisers or thepresident. He said it was ``under active discussion,'' and hedeclined to outline any timetable for the decision.   But in contrast to his suggestion earlier this week that thequestion would have to await the outcome of the Navy'sinvestigation of the incident, Fitzwater said he wanted toemphasize that ``we're moving along through the considerationprocess'' on the issue of compensation.   ``One of the driving forces behind our consideration is simplythe moral responsibility of America and the fact that we've alwaysbeen a humane nation that takes these kinds of problems veryseriously and assumes personal responsibilities,'' he said.   ``America has traditionally been a humane and moral nation whoassumes those responsibilities.''   The spokesman said there has been ``no response at all'' fromIran to Reagan's message on Sunday, when he explained the shootdownof the Iran Air jetliner by a missile from the USS Vincennes was anaccident and expressed ``deep regret.''   He said the administration would be ``deliberate'' in itsconsiderations and would ``opt for more time, and not less'' inreaching the decision.   Asked if there was any ``dollar figure'' under discussion,Fitzwater said, ``We aren't willing to discuss any dollar figure.''   Meanwhile, a U.S official said an Iranian deputy foreignminister and an Iranian-born scholar tried several times over thelast few months to open a diplomatic dialogue with the UnitedStates, but so far the initiatives have not panned out.   Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Larijani sent a probingmessage through a U.N. official in April, while the scholar, whoseidentify was not disclosed, approached the Reagan administrationtwice, saying he represented Iranian authorities, the U.S. officialtold The Associated Press.   In response to Larijani's overture, the administration asked forproof that he had the approval of the entire Iranian government,and ``it never got off the ground,'' said the official, who spokeonly on condition of anonymity.   Apparently alluding to the Iran-Contra scandal, the officialsaid ``We wanted to make sure we weren't burned.''   Meanwhile, Phyllis Oakley, the deputy State Departmentspokeswoman, stressed the United States remained interested in adialogue with Tehran.   ``Our position still holds,'' she said. ``We are prepared tomeet with an Iranian who speaks authoritatively for hisgovernment.''   Some analysts view Larijani as an ally of the relativelymoderate speaker of Iran's parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, but notas a representative of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini`sfundamentalist government.   In the case of the scholar, a native-born Iranian, the Reaganadministration also could not authenticate that his two probingmessages had the support of the Iranian government, the U.S.official who spoke anonymously said.   A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry on Thursday denied thatIran recently tried to open direct talks with Washington, accordingto the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.   The unidentified spokesman described such claims as ``futileefforts'' to divert world public attention from the destruction ofthe airliner.   The U.S. downing of the Iranian passenger jet led to revelationsthat the United States had tried to discuss ending the Persian Gulfwar and other problems despite a nine-year break in relations andthe continued plight of nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon.   Operating through the Swiss and other intermediaries, especiallyat the United Nations, the administration attempted to find out ifthe Iranians were willing to talk.   Relations with Tehran were broken in 1979 after the U.S. embassywas sacked and its American occupants were taken hostage for morethan a year.   The Reagan administration also holds pro-Iranian forces inLebanon responsible for the nine American hostages in that war-torncountry.   ``We certainly couldn't expect to have a normal relationshipwith Iran while American hostages are still being held, while thewar continues between Iran and Iraq, and, certainly, while Iranmaintains its present position of supporting terrorism andviolence,'' Mrs. Oakley said Wednesday.   However, she acknowledged ``various indirect messages'' had beenpassed to Iran, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz toldreporters traveling with him to Asia that ``we've had a number ofthese probes ... from Iran through various third parties sayingthat they'd like to talk with us, and we've responded to those.''</TEXT></DOC>
