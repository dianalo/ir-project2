Bush returned to the White House late Thursday after a day tripto New York where he mixed politics with a patriotic call to allAmericans to join his crusade for volunteerism.   He made clear his distaste for the Supreme Court's 5-4 rulingstriking down the 48 state laws against flag burning and otherdesecration.   The president told 1,000 business leaders he understands thelegal basis for the ruling, and ``will see that the law of the landis fully supported, but I have to give you my personal, emotionalresponse: flag burning is wrong, dead wrong.''   Bush's distaste for the ruling was matched in Congress as abipartisan Senate passed a resolution condemning the Supreme Courtdecision.   ``Congress has believed that the act of desecrating the flag isclearly not `speech' as protected by the First Amendment,'' said theresolution, which passed 97-3.   Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Howard Metzenbaum ofOhio, both Democrats, and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, aRepublican, were the only dissenters.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., summed up the majority mood: ``Wemust stand for America. The flag, the flag. America, America. Forus!''   At a New York Republican fund-raising dinner later Thursday, Bushurged the GOP to press for ``big legislative gains in Albany'' andother capitals to keep the Democrats from rigging congressionaldistrict lines after the 1990 Census.   ``It is absolutely essential that we block the gerrymanderingways of the Democratic party in all 50 states,'' he said. ``They'vedone it to us in the past, and we can't let them do it to us again.''   Bush also exhorted the faithful to wrest control of ``the mostpowerful local office in America'' from incumbent New York Mayor EdKoch. He tried to play no favorites in the three-man Republicanfield in September's primary, but stumbled and mispronounced thename of front-runner Rudolph Giuliani, the former top U.S. attorneyin Gotham.   ``Sorry, Rudy,'' he apologized.   The ex-prosecutor, vying against Ron Lauder and Herbert London,laughed it off, saying, ``If you haven't taken Latin, sometimes thename Giuliani can be a little difficult.''   Bush capped his New York visit with a stop at a black-tie banquetmarking the 100th anniversary of The Wall Street Journal. He hailedthe business newspaper as ``one of America's most trustedpublications,'' but quipped that the thing he really liked about itis ``you don't carry Doonesbury.'' That comic strip has takenfrequent shots at Bush over the years.   Bush also seized the occasion to repeat his pitch to corporateAmerica ``to enlist in a new crusade to bring national service intoevery corner of America.''   Bush's return from New York was delayed a half hour by anaccident involving containers of dangerous chemicals near NewarkInternational Airport that led him to detour in the fog to NewYork's Kennedy Airport. Containers of two toxic and potentiallyexplosive chemicals overturned while being loaded on trucks next tothe Newark airport, but never spilled, officials said.   Air Force One was flown to the other airport and Bush's motorcadewas held up at the banquet as the Secret Service plotted a new pathout of New York.   Earlier, Bush elaborated on plans for a public-private foundationcalled the Points of Light Initiative to spearhead the push forvolunteerism, and he chatted with youths who have spent years livingon the streets and now have found shelter at Father Bruce Ritter'sCovenant House.   Barbara Bush joined him at the shelter, cradling one youngwoman's three-week-old baby.   At one point in the unusual rap session, when a boy told thepresident he could make ``a $100 in 15 minutes'' peddling drugs,Mrs. Bush remarked that the same boy had said earlier that sellingdrugs led to jail, death ``and whatever the third (choice) was.''   ``Doesn't always happen, though,'' the boy replied.   ``Mrs. Bush,'' said the priest, ``the kids are bullet-proof.''   ``Oh, I forgot that,'' said the first lady.   New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, named by Bush to head an advisorycommittee for his Points of Light Initiative, said the emphasis onvoluntary service is ``a shift obviously away from the Great Societybecause what it's saying is clearly there are limits to whatgovernment can do.''   Bush is pledged to seek $25 million a year for four years for thefoundation from Congress, but his director of national service, C.Gregg Petersmeyer, emphasized, ``This isn't bricks-and-mortar. ...This is a movement.''</TEXT></DOC>
