(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anti-nuclear activists blocked gates atthe Seabrook nuclear power plant today, capping a weekend ofprotests that brought the arrest total to nearly 700.   Police said 48 people were arrested as they sat in the road infront of two gates and kept workers on the 7 a.m. shift fromentering the plant on time. They were quickly loaded into a van,many of them dragged by officers, and taken to the Seabrook policestation.   Some of those demonstrators returned two hours later and joinedothers to block one gate where management people tried to enter theplant, and at least 17 more arrests were made.   ``We've put in long hours and there is no reason that we shouldkeep having this aggravation,'' a frustrated Police Chief PaulCronin said today. ``And that's all it is. It's an aggravation forthe town, it's an aggravation for the police department.''   The arrests came a day after non-violent demonstrations thatresulted in 627 arrests, the second largest number of arrests inone day in 13 years of demonstrations that have made Seabrook asymbol of the nation's anti-nuclear movement. The largest was inMay 1977, when 1,414 people were arrested.   There was also a rally on Saturday, which attracted an estimated4,000 people.   ``I think this truly marks the beginning of a new era ofresistance to the Seabrook project. We will be back at this plantas they continue to attempt to license it,'' said Roy Morrison,shortly after he was arrested Sunday on a criminal trespass charge.   Protest spokeswoman Dianne Dunfey said protests could continuelater in the week as the start of low-power testing at the plantdraws near.   Employee Bob McCormack, who sat in his pickup truck honking atthe demonstrators in front of him, said he resented having hispassage blocked. McCormack said the protesters have a right toexpress their opinion but no right to interfere with his job.   Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said the demonstrators and the 4,000people who rallied Saturday at Hampton Beach State Park were a``vocal minority.'' Still, it was the largest anti-Seabrookgathering in 11 years.   ``The majority of people in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and therest of New England recognize that nuclear power is a viable energyalternative,'' Sher said. ``We're safe, we're needed and we'reready to produce electricity.''   Nearly three years after the $6 billion reactor was completed,it won its federal low-power testing license on May 26.   During the weekend, Seabrook engineers encountered a problemwith a valve in a safety-related system, but plant spokesmenpredicted the first atomic chain reaction in Seabrook's 100 tons ofuranium fuel would start by late this week.   The plant can't win a commercial license before the NuclearRegulatory Commission approves evacuation plans for crowded beachesand communities up to 10 miles from the plant _ includingMassachusetts communities that have refused to cooperate in makingthe plans.   Interviewed late Sunday night at the Seabrook police station,Cronin said the 627 arrests included about 75 people who werearrested twice.   Before the weekend, Clamshell organizers had met several timeswith state and local police to discuss plans for the protest.   ``It went pretty much as planned,'' Cronin said.   The weekend's demonstrations were organized by the ClamshellAlliance, which has been staging protests against Seabrook sinceplant construction began in 1976.   About 1,500 protesters converged on the plant site Sunday.Hundreds of them climbed over or crawled under boundary fencesaround the plant and sat down when they met police lines a shortdistance inside.   No protesters resisted arrest, though some would not walk towaiting school buses and had to be dragged on. Some protesterschatted briefly with their arresting officers and shook hands withthem.   No injuries were reported.   Morrison was among about 50 demonstrators who climbed a fence atan abandoned railroad siding on the north side of the plant,re-creating an August 1976 protest there that was the first groupcivil disobedience ever against a U.S. nuclear power plant.   The first over the fence was Paul Gunter, who was among the 18arrested in the protest in 1976.   Many of the protesters arrested in the first wave of civildisobedience Sunday returned to the scene waving their pink summonsslips for criminal trespassing.</TEXT></DOC>
