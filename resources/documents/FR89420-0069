In addition, today'snotice publishes the granting of Trane's application for an Interim Waiver.Trane manufactures residential heating appliances. The petition requestsDOE to grant relief from the DOE test procedure relating to the blowertime delay specification for Trane's condensing furnaces TUC(-) up-flowmodels and TDC(-) down-flow models. Trane seeks to test using a blowerdelay time of 30 seconds instead of the specified 1.5 minute delay betweenburner on-time and blower on-time.

McCabe, U.S. Departmentof Energy, Office of Conservation and Renewable Energy, Mail Station CE-132,Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585,(202) 586-9127.Eugene Margolis, Esq., U.S. Department of Energy, Office of General Counsel,Mail Station GC-12, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW.,Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-9507.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles)was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA),Pub. L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy ConservationPolicy Act (NECPA), Pub. L. 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, and the National ApplianceEnergy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Pub. L. 100-12, which requiresDOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumptionof certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the testprocedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption thatwill assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test proceduresappear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.DOE has amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process, 45 FR 64108. DOE furtheramended the Department's appliance test procedure waiver process to allowthe Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy to grantan interim waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers thathave petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51FR 42823, November 26, 1986. The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy to waive temporarily test proceduresfor a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic modelcontains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing accordingto the prescribed test procedures or when the basic model contains oneor more design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribedtest procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate thebasic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumptionas to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generallyremain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective,resolving the problem that is the subject of a waiver.The interim waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the AssistantSecretary to grant an interim waiver when it is determined that the applicantwill experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiveris denied, it if appears likely that the petition for waiver will be grantedand/or the Assistant Secretary determined that it would be desirable forpublic policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determinationon the petition for waiver.Trane's petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that requirea 1.5 minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and startingof the circulating air blower. Instead, Trane requests the allowance totest using a 30 second blower time delay when testing its condensing furnacesmodels TUC(-) and TDC(-). Trane states that the 30 second delay is indicativeof how these condensing furnaces actually operate. Such a delay resultsin an energy savings of approximately 1.8 percent. Since current DOE testprocedures do not address this variable blower time delay, Trane asks thatthe waiver be granted.The Department finds that it would be desirable for public policy reasonsto grant Trane's Application for Interim Wavier. Specifically, in thoseinstances where DOE has granted a waiver for a similar product design,it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and ratedfor energy consumption on a comparable basis. Previous waivers for thistype of timed blower delay control have been granted to the Coleman Company,the Magic Chef Company and the Rheem Manufacturing Company. 50 FR, 2710,January 18, 1985, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985, and 53 FR 48574, December1, 1988, respectively.Therefore, Trane's Application for an Interim Waiver requesting relieffrom the DOE test procedures for its condensing furnace models TIC(-) andTDC(-) is granted.Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The petition contains no confidentialinformation. DOE solicits comments, data, and information respecting thepetition.In addition, pursuant to paragraph (e) of section 430.27 of the Code ofFederal Regulations, the following letter granting the Application forInterim Waiver was issued to The Trane Company. <ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, April 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.
