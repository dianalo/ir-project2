<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0685 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since the early suggestions that many nuclei having the last odd nucleonin the 1g/sub 9/2/ shell, might be candidates for the Coriolis CouplingModel (CCM), much experimental information have emerged. In particularmany of the high spin states in nuclei near mass number 100 seem to exhibitrotational structure. Nevertheless, many of their spectra at lower excitationenergies seem to agree with the expectation of a weak coupling model(WCM). The most important point in the CCM is that the coupling termis specified to be 2 (I,j) and the core is identified to be rotational.The key difference between the WCM and the CCM is that in the WCM theparticle is coupled to spherically symmetric states and in the CCM theyare coupled to axially symmetric states. This difference in symmetriesin two cases manifests itself in the electro-magnetic properties suchas moments and transition rates. To show these similarities and the differencesbetween the two models, the author constructs first an extreme CoriolisCoupling Model (ECCM), for the 1f/sub 7/2/ and 1g/sub 9/2/ shells. Hehas calculated the low lying positive parity states of /sup 50/Ti, thusextending the model of ref. 1 to an even-even nucleus.</TEXT></DOC>
