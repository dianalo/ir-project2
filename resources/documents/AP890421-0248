A grim performance by RJR Nabisco Inc. may have been expected,due to its $25 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., butthat didn't make the news any easier to bear.   The company said it shouldered $247 million in so-called``change of control'' costs, including severance pay, pension planbenefits and other payments to executives leaving on account of thebuyout.   RJR Nabisco shareholders are expected to approve the deal withKohlberg Kravis at a special meeting on Thursday.   The flop of RJR Nabisco's Premier smokeless cigarette, which wasrecently yanked from test market store shelves because consumersrejected the brand, also had something to do with the earningsslump.   The company said its after-tax income in the January throughMarch period amounted to $103 million, down 62 percent from $273million in the same quarter a year ago.   Sales in the quarter were up 5 percent, to $4 billion from $3.8billion in 1988.   Without the buyout-related costs and a charge for abandoning thePremier tests, net income would have been up 17 percent to $320million in the first quarter.   The leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco is setting precedents forcosts associated with these deals in which a target company'sassets and cash flow typically are tapped to finance thetransaction.   For RJR Nabisco, further costs could show up in subsequentearnings statements.   The buyout was expected to impair RJR Nabisco's profitabilitybut the magnitude of the effect in the first quarter was a surpriseto some analysts.   Among other companies posting results, General Motors Corp.reported a 42.2 percent first-quarter profit gain, reflectingimprovements in North American automobile operations and continuedcost-saving measures.   The nation's largest company said it earned $1.55 billion, or$2.37 per share, in the three months ended March 31, up from $1.09billion, or $1.56 per share, for the same 1988 period.

American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. reported a 20.7 percent risein first-quarter earnings to $594 million, or 55 cents a share,from $492 million, or 46 cents a share, as revenue rose 3.2 percentto $8.66 billion from $8.39 billion. ATandamp;T benefited from growth ininternational sales of products and services plus a surge inlong-distance calling.   BankAmerica Corp. said its net income soared 152 percent in thefirst quarter, underscoring the strength of the big bank holdingcompany's recovery.
