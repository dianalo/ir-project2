Using code names like ``Tipped Kettle II,'' ``Elephant Herd,''and ``Focal Point,'' U.S. officials praised, cajoled, warned andadmonished other governments in the massive secret effort to keepthe Contra movement alive.   Details of the effort were laid out in an extraordinary documentread into the record Thursday in the trial of Oliver North, thefired National Security Council aide accused of breaking the law inefforts to help the Nicaraguan rebels. The government and North'sattorneys agreed that the facts in the document are true.   The outlines of this arm-twisting effort had emerged in previousnews reports and in the congressional investigation into theIran-Contra case. But the extent of the government's efforts andthe number of individuals who were aware of them are described forthe first time in the summary of facts.   The document names at least 40 U.S. officials, incluingPresident Bush _ then Reagan's vice president _ who were aware ofthe clandestine efforts to get assistance for the Contras,including during the 1984-85 period when Congress blocked directand indirect U.S. aid to the rebels, and into 1986 when onlynon-lethal aid was allowed.   North's defense hinges on the argument he orchestrated theefforts at the orders of White House superiors. That proposition isbolstered by the court document, in which 107 points of fact areasserted.   Those facts show the aid efforts took bizarre turns.   Longtime enemies Taiwan and the People's Republic of China wereboth approached to aid the Contras. Apparently the meeting with therepresentative of the Communist government was under FBIsurveillance, because the document says the FBI was asked to keepits report on the meeting secret.   In another apparent case of the government watching itself, thedocument said the White House and the CIA ``learned of reports'' ofa meeting between an Israeli government official and MichaelArmacost, then undersecretary of state for political affairs, todiscuss Israeli help for the Contras.   And North met with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, whooffered to kill Sandinista leaders if the United States would helphim clean up his image. North rejected the assassination proposal,but said Noriega might help in sabotage in Nicaragua. The Reaganadministration later indicted Noriega in connection with drugdealing.   The court document's 107 points center on Reagan administrationefforts to enlist other countries in the Contra effort. Inparticular, major pressure was applied to get Nicaragua's fourclosest neighbors _ El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, andGuatemala _ to provide arms, facilitate weapons deliveries andallow their territory to be used for support operations.   Quid pro quo arrangements abounded.   Reagan, depicted as taking an active role in third-countrysolicitation, was told in February 1985 that Honduras needed ``someenticements...so that it would maintain its aid to theresistance,'' said a memo from then-National Security adviserRobert McFarlane.   Subsequently ``the president personally authorized the entireplan'' in which the Hondurans were to receive expedited economicaid and military assistance in exchange for helping the Contras,the court summary says.   Bush is cited as an emissary from the White House to Honduras,carrying word in March 1985 to then-President Roberto Suazo thatReagan would speed U.S. aid to his country.   While Reagan was telephoning and sending messages to Suazourging that he do all in his power to ``support those who strugglefor freedom and democracy,'' State Department officials publiclywere sounding a different tone. They assured congressional hearingsthat the government view was that solicitation of third countrieswas illegal under the ongoing aid ban.   Later in 1985, the Hondurans again were waffling, annoyed thatthey were being put upon.   They were upset that promised U.S. aid had not come through andwere ``particularly angry that the U.S. Embassy there had recentlydenied any connection with the resistance, referring inquiries torepresentatives of Honduras,'' the court summary said.   By early 1986, the importance of getting Honduran cooperationfor the secret Contra air resupply network led to plans for Bush toplay a major role in pressuring the new president, Jose Azcona.   The document does not say whether Bush ultimately carried itout, but cites a State Department memo prepared for a Bush meetingwith Azcona, with the Honduran expected to insist on getting``clear economic and social benefits from its cooperation with theUnited States.''   Bush was to emphasize the importance of keeping the Contrasstrong, while National Security Adviser John Poindexter would meetprivately with Azcona to seek a commitment for Honduran support ofthe Contras, the document said.   The late CIA Director William Casey also is depicted as playinga key role in bringing other countries into the Contra-aid business.   In mid July of 1984, he told his deputy John McMahon and DeputySecretary of State Kenneth Dam that ``those present ought to getmoving'' on non-U.S. funding for the rebels in light of AttorneyGen. William French Smith's ruling that such fund-raising would notbe an impeachable offense _ a fear that had been raised by thenWhite House Chief of Staff James A. Baker III. Baker is now Bush'ssecretary of state.   Smith's ruling stated that third-country solicitation wasacceptable only if there was no ``quid pro quo.''   As early as August of 1984, shortly after Congress cut off U.S.aid to the rebels, Secretary Shultz was proposing a plan to ``winkat lethal support for the resistance,'' according to the document.The idea was that the United States would give arms to El Salvadorwhich in turn would give arms to the contras.   In his testimony to the congressional Iran-Contra investigatingcommittees, however, Shultz had said he opposed soliciting thirdcountries that were major U.S. aid recipients.   If Contra supporters were rewarded, then the Reagan White Housetook the opposite view of those who didn't cooperate.   In the case of Costa Rica, its new president Oscar Arias was apersona non grata in Washington after his government revealed inSeptember 1986 the existence of the Santa Elena airstrip, which hispredecessor had sanctioned for use by the Contra supply operation.North recommended cancellation of a planned Arias visit to theWhite House because of the Santa Elena disclosure.   Conversely, North got Reagan to agree in March 1986 to pose fora ``photo opportunity'' with Costa Rican official Benjamin Piza,who had arranged for construction of the Santa Elena airstrip.   In 1986, the Guatemalans were seeking new U.S. recognition fortheir assistance to the Contras.   After meeting with Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo inSeptember 1986, the court document says, a U.S. official informedReagan, Bush, Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger andPoindexter ``that in return for Guatemalan support for theresistance, Cerezo would ask Secretary of State Shultz to triplemilitary assistance ot Guatemala, to double economic assistance toGuatemala, and to undertake other forms of support for Guatemala.''   North had recommended in March 1985 that additional military aidbe sent to Guatemala ``as a means of compensating Guatemala for theassistance it was providing to the resistance,'' the court documentsaid.   Guatemala had a valuable role as provider of phony end usercertificates that certified it was the recipient of $8 millionworth of weapons shipments that actually were going to the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
