Sandamp;P also downgraded ratings on certificates of deposit of several of the companies' banking units. Real estate loans make up the largest portion of the lending portfolios at nearly all big Texas banks.    Sandamp;P lowered ratings on senior debt of Dallas-based MCorp to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus, on its subordinated debt to double-B-plus from triple-B, on its preferred to double-B-minus from double-B and on commercial paper to A-3 from A-2. The company said it was disappointed with the Sandamp;P action, which it said reflected &quot;continuing concerns about the persistent economic weakness in our primary markets.&quot; About $600 million of MCorp debt was affected.    Sandamp;P also downgraded $65 million of senior debt of Texas American Bancshares Inc., Fort Worth, to double-B from triple-B-minus. The company didn't comment on the action. Ratings on certificates of deposit of its Texas American Bank, Fort Worth, unit were lowered to double-B-plus/single-B from triple-B-minus/single-A-3.    Subordinated debt of First Amarillo Bancorp. was downgraded to triple-C-minus from single-B-minus. Sandamp;P cited the Amarillo-based company's three consecutive years of losses and termed its liquidity &quot;mediocre&quot; because of withdrawals by depositors. H. Joe Horn, First Amarillo's chief financial officer and treasurer, said, &quot;I understand their reasoning, based on the loss our company sustained in 1986.&quot;    Sandamp;P lowered Allied Bancshares' senior debt to triple-B-minus from triple-B and its commercial paper to A-3 from A-2.    Sandamp;P also lowered its ratings on issues supported by the bank's letters of credit and Allied's certificates of deposits to triple-B-minus/A-3 from triple-B/A-2.    About $50 million of debt is affected, Sandamp;P said.    Though Allied has a relatively low level of exposure to energy, Sandamp;P said its substantial exposure in real estate &quot;presents significant risk.&quot; Sandamp;P said it also expects earnings to remain &quot;weak&quot; for the foreseeable future. Allied couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
