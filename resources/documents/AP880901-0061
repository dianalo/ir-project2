(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker made the highest bid for theassets of PTL, moving him a giant step closer toward recapturingthe television ministry he was forced to leave after a sex andmoney scandal.   PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said he expectedtoday to formalize the $165 million proposal Bakker made Wednesdayto buy the Heritage USA Christian retreat, PTL television networkand other assets.   Bakker and his attorney, Jim Toms, met Wednesday with Benton tooutline their plan.   ``We've discussed the terms; we've agreed on everything,''Benton said. ``The lawyers are now documenting it and as soon asthe papers are ready ... and everybody's agreed, we probably willboth sign it and then we'll have us a deal.''   Toms said Bakker intends to present a letter of credit and tomake a formal announcement today of the plan, which could total$200 million when money for improvements and repairs at HeritageUSA is included.   Final approval of bids for PTL's assets rests with BankruptcyJudge Rufus Reynolds, who set a Sept. 10 deadline for Benton topresent any offers to buy the ministry, which is under Chapter 11protection from creditors.   Canadian real estate magnate Peter Thomas, chairman of SamothCapital Corp., had offered $113 million. Thomas said Wednesday hewas unwilling to increase his bid ``and enter a bidding war,'' butwas skeptical of Bakker's proposal.   Bakker ``has been all talk so far'' and unwilling to reveal hisfinancial backers, he said. ``It makes one wonder where he'sgetting the cash from.''   Thomas said from his office in Vancouver that his $1 milliondeposit was mailed back to him, but he added that his offer wouldbe renewed if Bakker fails to come up with the funding.   PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987, threemonths after Bakker left the ministry amid allegations of misuse ofmoney and revelations of his sexual encounter with church secretaryJessica Hahn.   Bakker was greeted Wednesday at the offices of the Jim and TammyMinistries, his new ministry, by cheers of ``praise God'' and``thank you, Jesus.''   ``As it stands now, we will be able to have Heritage USA. It'sbeen a long wait,'' Bakker said to the applause of his followers.   Bakker said he has the financial backing for a bid that totalsat least $165 million, including about $70 million in cash up frontat closing and up to $15 million to pay off debts owed Kansascontractor Roe Messner, who was PTL's prime builder.   Bakker also plans to obtain an $80 million mortgage on 1,000acres of undeveloped land at Heritage USA. The money would be aguarantee that he will restore the benefits of PTL's majorcontributors, its so-called Lifetime Partners.   ``When you boil it all down it's a matter of who would providethe most dollars for the creditors,'' Benton said. He said thereremained the possibility that someone could come up with a betterbid. ``But it's getting late,'' he said.   Benton had said he wanted all bids in before today.   Bakker said his financial backer ``is a corporation of 28international business people who pool their money for investmentsin the U.S.'' He said the terms of his agreement with the backerprevented him from further identifying those involved.   Toms said a lawsuit filed by PTL officials, seeking to recover$52 million from the Bakkers and his top aides for allegedlymismanaging ministry funds, ``should not impede approval of theplan.''   ``Part of the negotiations included that all claims would beassumed by the new owner,'' Toms said. ``If the suit were tocontinue after Bakker regained the ministry, he would essentiallybe suing himself.''</TEXT></DOC>
