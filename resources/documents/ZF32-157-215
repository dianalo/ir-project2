 Of the three major types ofprinters, laser printers offer the highest quality, producingprofessional quality results due to its non-impact, lightbeam-based technology.andP;  The price of some low-end laser printers,capable of output of three to four pages per minute, has beencoming down into the range of competing 24-pin dot matrixprinters.andP;  Dot matrix printers, available in nine-pin, 18-pin and24-pin models, remain the most popular printers.andP;  Nine-pin dotmatrix printers, given their low price, may be ideal for somenetworking needs.andP;  Ink jet printers are in a difficult positionsince they cannot compete with laser printers for quality nor withdot matrix when it comes to price.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Equipment AcquisitionPrintersDot-Matrix PrintersLaser PrintersInk-Jet PrintersCost of OperationUser Needs.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Selecting a printer is a difficult task.andP;  It is necessary to understand thefeatures that each printer offers in order to select the one that best suitsyour application.andM;The main factors influencing printer purchases are price, output quality,speed and options.andP;  The challenge arises when weighing these factors againstone another to determine exactly what type of product you need.andM;For example, you might be looking for a printer with high output quality tobe shared by all of the workstations in your office.andP;  In this case, either a24-pin or a laser printer would most likely be suitable.andM;On the other hand, if you were looking for inexpensive printers to be set upat each workstation for printing rough drafts, a nine- pin dot matrix printerwould probably be suitable.andM;The key to successfully selecting a printer is to understand the advantagesand disadvantages associated with each type.andM;Ink-jet printers operate virtually on the same principal as dot matrixprinters.andP;  Both types form letters with a series of dots.andM;However, the primary difference between the two is that ink-jet printersspray the dots in a non-impact manner, while dot matrix printers transfer thedots through impact on a ribbon.andM;Ink-jet printers have declined in popularity over the years, and have beenoffset by better quality laser and dot matrix printers.andM;Ink-jet printers are in a difficult market position because they don'tcompare to laser printers in quality and they can't compete with dot matrixprinters on price.andM;The quality of the ink-jet printer is inferior because the &quot;spraying&quot; actionthat transfers the dots also causes blurring.andM;Although the price of the ink-jet printer has dropped in accordance withlaser printer prices, it is still one of the more expensive types ofprinters.andP;  Unfortunately, the quality is sometimes poor, making it difficultto easily cost-justify this selection.andM;Laser printers form characters in a non-impact manner.andP;  The laser image isformed with a light beam that can be turned off and on very quickly toaccurately form characters.andP;  As a result, laser printers have a highresolution and can produce documents that are professional and suitable forpresentation.andM;Laser printers are sensitive and, as such, require clean and temperaturecontrolled conditions.andP;  It is an expensive type of printer and, as a result,accessories and repairs for lasers are also very expensive.andP;  For this reason,many companies opt to buy one high-quality laser printer, with a fullselection of options, to be shared by all of the workstations in the office.andM;In some network situations, there are less expensive, lowend printers set upat each workstation for draft purposes, and presentation documents are sentto the laser printer that is hooked up to the file server.andM;Relatively inexpensive laser printers, that turn out three to four pages perminute, have recently been introduced to the market.andP;  The price of theseprinters is close enough to that of ink-jet and 24-pin dot matrix printersthat they are starting to attract more buyers.andM;Like the ink-jet printer, dot matrix printers form characters with a seriesof dots.andP;  There are three main types of dot matrix printers: nine-pin, 18-pinand 24-pin.andP;  Of these three types the most popular is the nine-pin printer.andO;Nine-pin dot matrix printers are inexpensive and, as a result, are attractiveto small businesses, educational institutions and the home market.andM;Twenty-four-pin dot matrix have the highest resolution and are at the highend of the dot matrix market.andM;They have also dropped in price and are expected to take over some of themarket from nine-pin printers.andM;When you take into account the many factors that affect your buying decision,it is easy to see why buying a printer requires careful consideration.andM;Before you purchase a printer, be sure you have carefully assessed yourneeds, the capabilities of the printer and its suitability to yourapplication.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
