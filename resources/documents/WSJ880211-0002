Ronald Semler, 44 years old, and Barry Semler, 38, were convicted in U.S. District Court here yesterday. Ronald Semler was sentenced to three years in prison, and Barry Semler was sentenced to a year and a day, as the result of a plea-bargaining agreement.    Jeffrey Modisett, assistant U.S. attorney, said the case began in 1985 when authorities discovered that a West German distributorship controlled by the two men, Delta Avia, had illegally exported more than 100 helicopters made by Hughes Helicopters Inc. to North Korea.    But according to Vincent Marella, an attorney for the two men, they didn't know that the helicopters were sold to North Korea and therefore weren't charged with trading with the enemy.    North Korea, Cuba and certain other Communist nations are regarded as enemies under federal law.    Mr. Marella said the men pleaded guilty to &quot;technical violations,&quot; some of which concerned the falsification of records at a family-controlled domestic distribution company, Associated Industries.    Delta Avia, formed in 1981, is no longer a distributor for Hughes Helicopters, which was bought in 1984 by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. and renamed McDonnell Douglas Helicopters Co.    Mr. Modisett said that Mesa, Ariz.-based McDonnell Douglas Helicopters and some current and former officials are under investigation in the case. The company hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing.    A McDonnell Douglas Helicopters spokesman declined to comment, but said that the company's management has cooperated fully in the past with authorities in connection with the exporting case.    The Commerce Department, which participated in the investigation, hailed the guilty pleas as a major victory for U.S. export-control enforcers. &quot;The illegal shipments of these helicopters to North Korea caused serious concerns to our South Korean allies,&quot; said Paul Freedenberg, acting undersecretary of commerce for export administration. </TEXT></DOC>
