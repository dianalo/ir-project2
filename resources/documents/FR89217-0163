This Notice discusses how claims forindemnification and requests for Federal disposal should be prepared andsubmitted to EPA. It also instructs persons who responded to the April15, 1987, Notice how to affirm, amend, or withdraw a previously submittedclaim and/or request, or to submit a claim for indemnification and/or requestfor disposal assistance for previously ineligible products.This Notice establishes two time periods with separate deadlines for ownersto submit claims for indemnification and/or requests for disposal. Ownersof products which may not be used in 1989 on caneberries must file claims/requestsduring the first time period. Owners of products which may be used on caneberriesmust file claims/requests during the second time period. Procedures forfiling claims/requests are discussed in Unit II. of this Notice. Unit II.B. lists products for which claims/requests may be submitted during oneof these two time periods.This Notice also discusses the interim storage, transportation, and disposalof dinoseb stocks. EPA has awarded contracts to two waste management firmsfor the disposal of dinoseb. It is the responsibility of the holder tostore the dinoseb safely and transport it to EPA's designated facilitywhen EPA is ready to receive the stocks.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>A. Legal StandardSection 6 of FIFRA authorizes the EPA Administrator to take certain actionsto prohibit sale, distribution, and use of pesticide products that poseunreasonable adverse effects to human health or the environment. If useof a pesticide poses a risk that outweighs the benefits of continued use,the pesticide's registration may be cancelled and/or suspended. If actionis necessary to prevent an imminent hazard to human health or the environment,the Administrator may announce his intent to suspend a pesticide registrationat the same time he issues a Notice of Intent to Cancel. If an emergencyexists which does not permit the Administrator to hold a hearing beforesuspending a pesticide registration, he may issue an Emergency SuspensionOrder which immediately halts all use, sale, and distribution of the pesticide.Adversely affected persons may request, within certain time frames, a hearingto challenge EPA's suspension. After an opportunity for a expedited hearing,a Final Suspension Order can be issued. Also in accordance with section6 of FIFRA, a Notice of Intent to Cancel and deny registrations providesthat a pesticide product would be cancelled 30 days after publication ofthe cancellation notice or its receipt by the registrant unless the registrantor other adversely affected person requests a hearing to contest the cancellationof that registration.Prior to its amendment in December 1988, section 15 of FIFRA required theAdministrator to make indemnity payments to owners of pesticides suspendedand cancelled under section 6 who suffered losses by reason of the Agency'sactions. The statute provided that indemnification is payable to any personunder the following conditions:1. The Administrator suspended the registration to prevent an imminenthazard.2. The registration was subsequently cancelled.3. The person owned some quantity of the pesticide immediately before thesuspension.4. The person suffered losses by reason of the suspension or cancellation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Under section 15(b), the amount of indemnity payment was to be determinedon the basis of the cost of the pesticide owned by the person immediatelybefore the suspension, but could not exceed the pesticide's fair marketvalue at that time.Also prior to the 1988 amendments, section 19(a) of FIFRA and the regulationspromulgated pursuant to it at 40 CFR Part 165 required Administrator toaccept at convenient locations for safe disposal those pesticides the registrationsof which have been suspended and cancelled as specified in section 6(c),if requested by the owner of the pesticide. However, before the owner ofa pesticide requests such acceptance, he/she must make every reasonableeffort to return the material to the manufacturer, distributor, or otheragents capable of relabeling, recovering, recycling, or reprocessing thematerial (See 40 CFR 165.4).Both sections 15 and 19 of FIFRA were substantially amended by Pub. L.100-532, the FIFRA Amendments of 1988, which was given into law by thePresident on October 25, 1988. EPA does not believe that the 1988 amendmentsare applicable to its current dinoseb indemnification and disposal program.Accordingly, all references in this Notice to sections 15 and 19 of FIFRArefer to the law as it existed prior to the 1988 amendments.B. Dinoseb HistoryBased on information about the adverse human health and environmental risksposed by dinoseb-containing pesticide products, on October 7, 1986, theAdministrator issued an Emergency Suspension Order for all registrationsof pesticides containing the active ingredient dinoseb. It immediatelyprohibited all further sale, distribution, and use of dinoseb products.Notice of this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 14, 1986 (51 FR 36634). Although fourregistrants requested a hearing concerning whether the suspension of dinosebproducts should remain in effect, these requests were withdrawn on October30, 1986, resulting in immediate entry of a Final Suspension Order.Also on October 7, 1986, the Administrator issued a Notice of Intent toCancel and deny registrations of all dinoseb-containing pesticide products,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 14, 1986 (51 FR 36650). Upon the expirationof the applicable 30-day period, many dinoseb registrations were cancelledby operation of law. However, several registrants requested hearings contestingthe EPA's cancellation action. These registrations were suspended, butnot cancelled, pending the outcome of an administrative hearing.Prior to issuance of a Final Cancellation Order, certain actions were takenwhich resulted in modification of the Suspension Order on dinoseb. First,EPA was petitioned under Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 164 to modify the FinalSuspension Order to permit use of dinoseb on certain crops. Following anadministrative hearing, on March 30, 1987, the Administrator issued a Decisionand Final Order Modifying the Final Suspension of Pesticide Products whichContain Dinoseb. This order and the FIFRA section 18 emergency exemptionswhich implemented it allowed limited use of FIFRA during the 1987 and 1988growing seasons on dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas in Washington and Idaho.A subsequent order permitted use on the same crops in certain countiesof Oregon.Second, following a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Oregon by a number of user groups, the Suspension Order ondinoseb was enjoined on April 15, 1987, with respect to certain crops inthe Pacific Northwest. <T3>Love v. Thomas, </T3>668 F. Supp. 1143 (D. Oregon 1987), <T3>affirmed in part </T3>838 F. 2d 1059 (9th Cir. 1988). In particular,the District Court ruling enjoined the Suspension Order as it applied todinoseb use on caneberries, cucurbits, green peas, and snap beans in theStates of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.  On June 9, 1988, the Administrator issued a Final Cancellation Order ondinoseb, cancelling all remaining registrations. However, the Order providedfor limited use of existing stocks of dinoseb on specific crops in thePacific Northwest during the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons. The Order permittedexisting stocks of all cancelled dinoseb products which were previouslylabeled for use on peas, lentils, or chickpeas to be sold, distributed,and used for weed control in dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, and green peasin the States of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington during the 1988 use season.In addition, the Order permitted existing stocks of all cancelled dinosebproducts previously labeled for use on caneberries (blackberries, boysenberries,loganberries, and raspberries) to be sold, distributed, and used for canecontrol in these crops in the States of Oregon and Washington for the 1988and 1989 use seasons. The 1989 caneberry use in Washington and Oregon isthe only allowable use remaining at this time.  The Final Cancellation Order was challenged in the same District Courtof Oregon, which initially issued a preliminary injunction partially stayingthe Order. However, the Court ultimately concluded it did not have jurisdictionto review the Order and, in the alternative, entered judgment sustainingthe Administrator's decision. <T3>Northwest Food Processors </T3>v. <T3>Thomas</T3>, N-88-641-RE (D. Oregon Sept. 25, 1988). The NorthwestFood Processors Association previously filed a petition in the Ninth CircuitCourt of Appeals seeking review of the cancellation order and has alsoappealed the Federal District Court decision to the Ninth Circuit Court. <T3>C. April 15, 1987 Federal Register Notice  </T3>EPA issued a notice, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 15, 1987 (52 FR 12352), announcing thatpursuant to sections 15 and 19 of FIFRA it was accepting claims for indemnificationand/or requests for disposal assistance for dinoseb pesticide productsthat were suspended and cancelled. The April 15, 1987 Notice describedprocedures and set a deadline of July 14, 1987 for filing claims and/orrequests for eligible products. As described in the April 15, 1987 Notice,eligibility did not extend to suspended dinoseb registrations which hadnot been cancelled (i.e., those registrations for which registrants hadrequested a cancellation hearing). Although such products were not eligiblefor indemnification and disposal assistance at that time, EPA requestedholders of these ineligible products to provide the Agency with certainbasic information, such as location and quantity of their stock. EPA requestedthis information to be able to estimate the total quantity and locationof all dinoseb products which could become eligible for indemnificationand disposal assistance if the registrations of such products were eventuallycancelled.  In response to the April 15, 1987 Notice, EPA received over 1200 submissions.About one-third of these were for products eligible at that time for indemnificationand disposal assistance, and the others were for products that were noteligible. All submissions were assigned claim or file numbers and informationfrom the aggregate was used to estimate the total amount and location ofdinoseb stocks. EPA has been reviewing these submissions and has contactedsome people regarding their claims/requests. EPA has made a number of offersto pay indemnification to owners, and is processing these claims as theacceptance agreements are returned by the owners. The Agency will be contractingall other people who responded to the April 15, 1987 Notice regardlessof whether their products were eligible or ineligible for indemnificationor disposal at the time of their initial submission. EPA appreciates thecooperation of holders of suspended-only products who responded to theApril 15, 1987 Notice. The information helped expedite the dinoseb indemnificationand disposal program.  After the publication of the April 15, 1987 Notice, and prior to issuanceof a Final Cancellation Order, several registrants who had requested acancellation hearing withdrew their requests and, in so doing, their dinosebregistrations were cancelled by operation of law. Once cancelled, ownersof such products were eligible to seek indemnification and disposal assistance.For example, the registrations of Uniroyal Chemical Company dinoseb productswere cancellations on June 19, 1987 when Uniroyal withdrew from the hearing.At that point, dinoseb products registered by Uniroyal became eligiblefor indemnification and disposal assistance. However, many owners of Uniroyalproducts may not have been aware of the cancellation and their subsequenteligibility. This Notice serves, in part, to announce that owners of Uniroyalproducts registered by other companies who withdrew from the hearing afterthe April 15, 1987 Notice was issued are now eligible to file claims forindemnification and requests for disposal and must file claims/requestsas outlined in Unit II. of this Notice.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Requirements for Indemnification and Disposal  </ITAG><T3>A. Who is Eligible to File Claims for Indemnification and Requestsfor Disposal? </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. General</ITAG>All federally registered dinoseb products, including products with SpecialLocal Need registrations (under section 24(c) of FIFRA), have been suspendedand cancelled. Accordingly, owners of these cancelled dinoseb productsincluding registrants, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and usersmay submit claims for indemnification and requests for disposal, providedthat the cancellation occurred after the October 7, 1986 Emergency SuspensionOrder and the other conditions specified in this Unit are met.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Effect of Intrastate Registration</ITAG>At the time of the October 7, 1986 Emergency Suspension Order, certainproducts containing dinoseb were being marketed under State pesticide registrationswith applications for Federal registrations pending before EPA in accordancewith EPA regulations at 40 CFR 162.17. Applications for these intrastateproducts were pending on October 7, 1986, when EPA issued a concurrentNotice of Intent to Deny all pending applications for Federal registrationof these products.The denial of Federal registration for these intrastate products was analogousto cancellation. A U.S. Claims Court decision in <T3>Gro-Green Products, Inc. </T3>vs. <T3>United States, </T3>3 Cl. Ct. 639 (1983), held that in similar circumstancesa claimant who held stocks of an intrastate pesticide product containingsilvex was entitled to indemnification. Accordingly, persons with dinosebproducts that were previously marketed under pending intrastate applicationsmay also be eligible for indemnification and disposal, and must submitany claim during the first time period established in Unit II. E.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Effect of Section 18 Emergency Exemptions, the District Court Rulingsand the Final Cancellation Order</ITAG>The Final Cancellation Order superceded all sale, distribution, and useof dinoseb under the section 18 emergency exemptions or the District Courtrulings. However, as discussed above, the Final Cancellation Order permittedthe sale, distribution, and use of dinoseb for certain crops in 1988 and1989. Persons who used dinoseb under the section 18 emergency exemptions,the District Court rulings, or the existing stocks provision (for usesother than on caneberries) in the Cancellation Order, and who have notsubmitted a claim for indemnification, must now do so. Further, if theyhave previously submitted a claim/request or information they must nowaffirm, amend, or withdraw it. Such amended claims/requests must reflectany product that was used or sold for one of these uses. However, if adinoseb product may be used on caneberries during the 1989 use season,they should not submit a claim or amend a claim until the second time periodas discussed in Unit II. E.Owners/holders of dinoseb should remember that products for which existingstocks may still lawfully be sold or used under the Cancellation Orderinclude <T3>any</T3> products labeled for caneberry uses, whether or not they werecancelled prior to issuance of the Order. Such products must be used onlyin full compliance with all of the stringent use restrictions requiredunder the Order, and supplemental labeling containing all of the use restrictionsmust accompany the product when it is sold or distributed. Holders of theseproducts may use, sell, or distribute their dinoseb stocks in Oregon and/orWashington during the 1989 caneberry use season in conformity with theCancellation Order. Owners/holders who previously submitted claims/requestson these products and who subsequently use, sell, or distribute some orall of their stock must amend their claim accordingly and notify EPA duringthe second time period as discussed in Unit II. E.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Ownership requirement</ITAG>Any person who owned some quantity of a registered dinoseb pesticide productimmediately before the registration of that product was suspended, or whosubsequently received a permissible assignment of the original owner'sclaim or a power of attorney from the original owner to file the claim,may claim indemnification for the product. Claims/requests may be filedby persons representing, in some legal capacity, the product owners atthe time of suspension or cancellation.A ``power of attorney'' is a document which appoints someone other thanthe actual product owner (the registrant, for example) as an agent of theproduct owner. In this instance, such a document merely gives an agentthe authority to submit an indemnification claim and receive payment onthe owner's behalf. The claim remains that of the pesticide owner.EPA encouraged registrants to recall their products from distributors andretailers, so that the dinoseb products would be consolidated. If a registrantrecalled its products, the registrant could obtain assignment of the originalowner's claim. The document of assignment transfers the pesticide owner'sright of indemnification to the other person. The pesticide owner thereafterhas no legal interest in the claim. Samples of a ``power of attorney''and assignment documents are provided in an Appendix to the Dinoseb ClaimForm. Forms are available from the regional offices listed in Unit II.D. of this Notice.The Federal Anti-Assignment of Claims Act would ordinarily bar an assignmentof a claim that occurred before the claim was allowed. As stated in theApril 15, 1987 Notice, EPA plans to waive this prohibition against ``early''assignments with regard to otherwise valid claims for indemnification undersection 15 of FIFRA. However, EPA intends to waive this prohibition onlywith respect to an assignee who took back the product as part of a recallor a seller who subsequently accepted returned stocks from purchasers.Owners such as end-users and dealers/distributors who have acquired stocksof dinoseb products since October 7, 1986, will not be eligible for indemnificationfor such stocks even if the products were acquired in a lawful manner becausethese people did not own the product on the date of suspension. EPA willnot waive the Anti-Assignment of Claims Act prohibition against assignmentof indemnification claims for these products because waiver of this prohibitionwould not be consistent with the purposes of the Act. Claims for indemnificationbelong only to the person who owned such stocks on October 7, 1986 andmay not be assigned to anyone else unless such assignment is part of arecall or return of stocks to suppliers.EPA suggests that any dealer or user who acquired stocks of dinoseb productsafter October 7, 1986, which he/she cannot or does not intend to lawfullysell or use should attempt to return such stocks to the party who ownedthem on October 7, 1986. Only that party is eligible to receive any indemnitypayment for remaining stocks. Likewise, any person who intends to acquiredinoseb for the lawful use permitted under the Final Cancellation Ordershould be cautioned that he/she would not be eligible for indemnificationfor that particular stock, if any is unused at the end of the 1989 useseason, because he/she was not its owner on October 7, 1986. However, evenif it is not possible to return remaining stocks of a cancelled pesticideproduct to the original owner, the new holder may submit a request forFederal disposal assistance if the stocks are otherwise eligible.EPA requires information from the claimant on the current ownership andlocation of the product, as well as the ownership at the time of suspension.For purposes of determining who owned the product at the time of suspension,the operative date is October 7, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Loss Requirement</ITAG>The amount of indemnity payment is to be determined on the basis of thecost of the pesticide owned by the person immediately before suspension,but can not exceed the pesticide's fair market value at that time. Ownerscan recover indemnification only for losses suffered. Therefore, anyonewho legally sold or used any dinoseb products after October 7, 1986 (e.g.,as legally permitted under section 18, the District Court injunctions,or the Final Cancellation Order) must make appropriate adjustments on his/herclaim. The total amount of ``loss'' sustained by the owner for a givenamount of a dinoseb product must be reduced by the proceeds of any saleor distribution of that product. Any owner who uses a given amount of adinoseb product has eliminated those ``losses'' that might otherwise havebeen sustained as a result of suspension and cancellation of the amountof product. A claimant is not entitled to an indemnity payment for anyamount of dinoseb product for which losses were recovered through saleor use.B. What Products Are Eligible for Indemnification and Disposal?The following lists include all dinoseb products that are now eligiblefor indemnification and Federal disposal assistance. List A contains productsfor which no caneberry uses are permitted, and for which EPA is now acceptingclaims/requests. Claims/requests for products in List A must be submittedduring the first time period specified in Unit II. E. List B contains productswhich may be used on caneberries in Washington and/or Oregon during the1989 caneberry season. Claims/requests for products on List B should notbe submitted to EPA until the second time period specified in Unit II.E.Most pesticide product labels contain an EPA registration number (usuallydesignated as ``EPA Reg. No. 999999-9999'') and an EPA establishment number(usually designated as ``EPA Est. No. 99999''). The owner should locatethe EPA registration number and use that for identifying his/her product(s)and for completing the form. The owner should not use the EPA establishmentnumber for identifying his/her product(s). That number is not sufficientlyspecific to be useful for the dinoseb indemnification and disposal program.Some product labels list a registration number that begins with the letters``SLN'' and then a two letter State abbreviation, followed by a 6-digitnumber. These are called section 24(c) or Special Local Need registrationsand are legitimate EPA registration numbers. In rare cases, pesticide productlabels do not contain an EPA registration number. These are probably ``intrastate''products that have never received a Federal registration number.

E., depending on whether the product also bears generallabeling for use on one or more caneberry crops. If a product is registeredunder section 24(c) and does not bear any labeling for use on a caneberrycrop, the owner may submit a claim during the first time period. </F></ITAG>Using these lists, the person filing the claim should find the product(s)for which he/she is claiming indemnification and/or requesting disposalassistance, and complete the claim form (including the product registrationnumber) as described in Unit II. C. If the registration number on the productlabel is not present on this list, and the owner is sure he/she has a dinosebproduct, he/she should file the claim or request using whatever numberis present on the label. The absence of a product registration number maybe explained by a registration transfer from one company to another. Insuch a case, the new registration legally encompasses all former registrationsand, as long as the registration was transferred to another company andwas subsequently suspended and cancelled under section 6(c) of FIFRA, theowner may be entitled to an indemnity payment and/or disposal assistancewith respect to that product even though the product now goes by anotherEPA registration number.C. What Information Must be Submitted?<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Claim Form and Supporting Documentation</ITAG>EPA has prepared an updated form for filing claims/requests and an instructionsheet to accompany it. The form and instructions distributed in conjunctionwith the April 15, 1987 Notice have been revised to reflect changes inthe eligibility and labeling of certain products that have occurred sincethe April 15, 1987 Notice. The revised materials can be obtained from theEPA regional offices listed in Unit II. D. of this Notice.It is the responsibility of the person submitting an indemnity claim tosubmit the required documentation to support the claim. The instructionsaccompanying the claim form indicate what type of supporting documentationis acceptable for each element of the claim. For example, all individualsfiling claims must submit evidence of the cost to the claimant in eitherproducing or acquiring the product. The cost is limited to the direct costof the product and does not include such incidental items as transportor storage costs. For registrants/manufacturers holding inventories ofa labeled and packaged product that could not be sold, production recordsshowing cost of production, or invoices showing the purchase cost willbe acceptable. Distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and users should submitpurchase invoices, purchase receipts, or notarized affidavits.If disposal or reprocessing has already occurred, evidence of legal disposalis also required. Records to be used as such evidence should be kept insufficient detail so that EPA could track the history of individual dinosebproducts for which indemnification is being sought. Such evidence mustinclude invoices or waste manifests from facilities permitted to handledinoseb wastes. In such a case, indemnity payments may be granted for thecost of the product but not for the cost of disposal or reprocessing.The form also provides a way to request disposal of a product, whetheror not indemnification is requested. All information requested on the formregarding quantity, unit number and size, and other facts pertinent todisposing of excess product must be submitted in order for the productto be eligible for Federal disposal.A claimant is not entitled to an indemnity payment for a dinoseb productfor which he/she has already recovered losses through sale or use. If anowner of a dinoseb product has sold or used any existing stocks (for example,for use consistent with the Final Cancellation Order, for other lawfuluses during past use seasons, for a non-pesticidal purpose, for use inanother country, or other purposes), the owner must reflect the effectof this sale or use in completing the claim form, since it will lower theamount of indemnification for which he/she is eligible. Any claim againstthe Federal government must be offset by the amount received from saleor use of the dinoseb product because the owner has eliminated those ``losses''he/she might otherwise have sustained as a result of suspension and cancellationof that amount of product.Any person submitting a claim as a legal representative of another personmust submit evidence which establishes his/her authority to file the claimand receive payment in satisfaction of the claim on behalf of the ownerof the product. A person submitting a claim as an assignee must submitevidence of assignment of the claim and demonstrate that such assignmentoccurred as part of a recall of the products in question.If at any time a claimant decides to withdraw a claim and/or request, he/shemust certify in writing that the product has been properly disposed of;lawfully sold, distributed, or used in accordance with the CancellationOrder, emergency exemptions, or the injunctions by the District Court ofOregon; recycled; or exported.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Business Records Verification</ITAG>Manufacturers, registrants, distributors, and any other claimants thatnormally maintain business records are permitted to consolidate the supportinginformation required to accompany the claim form and to verify the contentsof the claim by submitting an auditor's report or a schedule supportedby an independent certified accountant's statement verifying the validityof the schedule. Each element of the claim, such as cost per unit of productor quantity of product owned at the time of suspension, must be reviewedand verified by the independent auditor if verification for the completecontents of the claim is being provided through the report or statement.If the independent review is being conducted for only one element of theclaim, such as a manufacturer's cost of production per unit of product,supporting documentation must be submitted for all other elements of theclaim. EPA retains the right to request submission of the information thatformed the basis for the audits or reports in order to verify the validityof the information submitted.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Composite Claim Lists</ITAG>Registrants or suppliers who have recalled a product from their customersand who are assignees or representatives of those customers may submitcomposite lists for separate elements of the claim form identifying theproduct, product owner, quantities and units of pesticides, and other pertinentinformation indicated on the claim form. Documentation of the assignment,power of attorney, or other legal authorization from each original ownerof the product listed in such composite list must be submitted. The legaldocumentation should identify the parties and product involved. If thepesticide is still owned by anyone other than the person completing theclaim form, proof of each element of the claim must be submitted on behalfof the owner. For example, if a registrant has recalled material and isfiling the claim by power of attorney for the owner, the registrant mustsubmit verification of ownership at the time of suspension, the quantityof product returned to the registrant by the owner, and the cost of theproduct to the owner. If, on the other hand, the registrant is filing theclaim as an assignee, the registrant should provide the information andverification required by the claim form.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. </ITAG><T3>Confidential Business Information </T3>As a general matter, businesses may assert claims of business confidentialitycovering part of the information submitted through the claim form, in themanner described in 40 CFR 2.203(b). Any such assertions of confidentialityof business information must be supported by documentation of the reasonswhy disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm tothe competitive position of the business. The information covered by theassertion will be disclosed by EPA only to the extent allowed by FIFRAsection 10, and by means of the procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 2.If no such assertion and supporting documentation accompany the informationwhen it is received by EPA, it may be made available to the public by EPAwithout further notice to the business (See 40 CFR 2.203(a)(2)). EPA hasdetermined that it will not afford confidential treatment to certain informationrequested on the claim form because it must be disclosed to contractorsto arrange for disposal of the dinoseb pesticides. Confidentiality claimsshould not be applied to: the type, composition, and quantity of pesticideproduct, the unit size of containers, and the product's location. If EPAreceives any confidentiality claims for this information, the claim forindemnification and/or request for disposal will not be considered andwill be returned to the claimant. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. </ITAG><T3>EPA Investigations </T3>EPA plans to conduct random investigations of claims/requests submittedfor the purpose of establishing their veracity. In verifying claims/requests,EPA may seek to enter premises to examine any dinoseb pesticide productsbeing stored pending disposal to assure that they are being stored appropriately(i.e., in conformance with the regulations and guidelines described inUnit III.), to examine records relevant to the claim, or to conduct whateverother examinations are necessary to audit the claim. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. </ITAG><T3>Signing Claim Required </T3>The claimant or authorized representative must sign the claim form. Signingthe form constitutes agreement to the following: a. That all statements made and information provided in the claim are trueand correct to the best of the claimant's knowledge, and that the amountof the claim is an accurate statement of the cost of the product. b. That the claimant had no knowledge of facts which, in themselves, showedthat the dinoseb pesticide did not meet Federal registration requirements.c. That acceptance by the claimant of any payment made by EPA constitutesfull satisfaction and final settlement of the claim. d. That by submission of the claim, the claimant grants permission to authorizedagents of the Federal government to enter premises where records or productsare retained to conduct whatever inspections, audits, or examinations arenecessary to verify the contents of the claim. e. That by submission of the claim, the claimant waives any claim for confidentialtreatment of certain types of information, including the type, composition,and quantity of pesticide product, the unit size of containers, and theproduct's location. f. That the claimant has received no other payment for the cost of thepesticides for which indemnification is claimed and that should claimantreceive such other payment, claimant agrees to promptly reimburse the Federalgovernment, in such amount up to and including the full amount of the indemnificationpayment made under this program. g. That ownership of and responsibility for pesticide products for whichindemnification payments are made under this program remains with the claimantsand/or holders of the material unless and until EPA accepts the materialfor disposal under section 19 of FIFRA. h. That neither payment of indemnification under section 15 of FIFRA noracceptance of pesticides for disposal under section 19 of FIFRA in anyway constitutes a finding or warranty by the United States with respectto the proper or safe storage, packaging, handling, transport, or disposalof such products by the owners or holders of the products or by agents,employees, or other persons acting in their behalf.i. That if the claim is filed by an assignee, the United States may assertagainst the assignee any defenses, or right of set-off or counterclaim,applicable against the person who assigned the claim. D. Where Can a Claim Form be Obtained?Copies of the claim form can be obtained from EPA regional offices. Theregional office contact person for dinoseb indemnification and disposalinformation/claim forms, addresses, telephone numbers, and the States locatedwithin each EPA region are as follows: <ITAG tagnum="81">EPA Regional Offices</ITAG>1.

Region X, Jon Heller, 1200 6th Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101 (206-442-1970)(Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington). E. Where and When Must the Claim/Request be Filed?All claims for indemnification and requests for disposal for any dinosebproducts whose registration is listed in this Notice as having been suspendedand cancelled must be submitted to EPA in Washington, DC at the addresslisted under the <T2>``ADDRESS'' </T2>section at the beginning of this Notice. Because theFinal Cancellation Order permits the limited sale, distribution, and useof existing stocks of certain dinoseb products for vegetative cane controlin caneberries (blackberries, boysenberries, loganberries, and raspberries)in the States of Washington and Oregon during the 1989 use season, theAgency is establishing two time periods for submission of indemnificationclaims and requests for disposal assistance. EPA is not accepting claims/requests for products that can be used on caneberriesuntil after the 1989 season because it would be unable to compute the lossessuffered by owners until these opportunities for sale and use of the productshave expired. Therefore, owners of products that can legally be used oncaneberries should not submit claims and/or requests for disposal untilthe beginning of the second time period. The first time period extends from February 17, 1989 to June 19, 1989.Owners of dinoseb products which may not be used on caneberries in Washingtonand Oregon must submit claims for indemnification and requests for disposalassistance during this period. The second time period extends from June15, 1989 to August 15, 1989, and owners of dinoseb products which may beused on caneberries in Washington and Oregon during the 1989 use seasonmust submit claims for indemnification and requests for disposal assistanceduring this second time period. Unit II. B. of this Notice lists productsaccording to whether or not they are labeled for use on caneberries.Claims submitted by owners of products that were eligible for indemnificationat the time of the April 15, 1987 Notice but which may be used on caneberriesin Washington and/or Oregon will not be processed until after June 15,1989.As explained previously, EPA will be contacting all people who submittedinformation on their dinoseb products, but whose products were ineligibleat the time of the April 15, 1987 Notice. If none of the information haschanged, the owners will be able to affirm the information in their priorsubmission and formally submit their claims/requests by returning a signedsummary claim sheet and certification form during the first or second timeperiod, depending on whether their products may be used on caneberries.In addition, EPA has decided to afford owners of products eligible at thetime of the April 15, 1987 Notice but who failed to submit a claim and/orrequest for disposal assistance in response to the April 15, 1987 Notice,a second opportunity to do so now. These people should determine whethertheir product may be used on caneberries, and thus whether to respond duringthe first or second period. All claims/requests must be submitted by August15, 1989. All claims/requests received after August 15, 1989 will be denied.EPA does not plan to provide another opportunity to file or submit claimsfor indemnification or requests for disposal assistance for dinoseb stocks.If a claim/request is filed within the prescribed time period, but EPArequests supporting documentation not included with the original claim/request,an appropriate period will be allowed for submission of the additionalinformation required for consideration of the claim/request.A claim/request may be amended at any time before final action by EPA.All amendments must be submitted in writing and signed by the claimantor his/her authorized agent or legal representative.Further, in order to expedite the disposal of dinoseb products, EPA requestspersons who will be submitting requests for disposal assistance duringthe time period June 15, 1989 through August 15, 1989, but who have notyet submitted information or a request for disposal assistance to so notifyEPA Headquarters disposal staff immediately by telephone (1-800-DIN-OSEB(in Maryland call 1-800-331-3704)).F. How Will Claims be Processed?Upon receipt of a claim, EPA will assign it a claim number and all correspondenceregarding the claim will reference that number. All claimants will be notifiedof any additional information or verification required for considerationof the claim. If a claimant is unable to provide the documentation requiredfor consideration of his/her claim within the prescribed time period, theclaim will be denied. EPA plans to conduct random audits of claims, includingfield inspections, and may reject claims if investigators are not permittedto enter the claimant's premises or are otherwise impeded in conductingan audit.EPA's determinations regarding eligibility of claims and amounts of indemnitypayable shall be administratively final.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Interim Storage, Transportation And Disposal of Dinoseb Stocks</ITAG>EPA encourages all registrants and manufacturers that are capable of recallingor reprocessing their dinoseb pesticide products to do so. However, ifthe product is reprocessed, the amount of indemnity to which that personis entitled may be affected.EPA has awarded contracts to two waste management firms for the disposalof dinoseb. It is the responsibility of the holders to handle and storethe material safely. The conditions required for proper handling of dinosebpesticides may be governed by FIFRA or the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct (RCRA), as well as by pertinent state and local laws and requirements.The determination of whether FIFRA or RCRA applies depends on the intentof the holder (See 40 CFR 261.2(a)(2)(i) and 261.33, 40 FR 637 (Jan. 24,1985)). Simply stated, if unused dinoseb pesticide stocks are being heldwith the intent of legally using, recycling, selling, or distributing them,then they may still be considered pesticide products and should be storedin accordance with FIFRA. However, once the stocks are being held withthe clear intent of disposing of them, then they may be considered solidor hazardous wastes and must be stored, transported, and disposed of inaccordance with RCRA and any other applicable laws and regulations governingwastes. The procedures for handling, storing, and disposing of dinosebunder FIFRA and RCRA are described in more detail in the following units.A. Interim StorageIn general, the FIFRA procedures for storage described in 40 CFR 165.10recommend that the material be stored on pallets or similar raised platformsin a dry, well-ventilated, and separate room, building, or covered areawith a concrete floor, where fire protection is provided. Movement or handlingshould be kept to an absolute minimum.Containers should be stored with the label plainly visible. Containersshould be checked regularly for corrosion and leaks. If a dinoseb containeris found to be leaking or damaged, the container should be transferredto a sound, suitable, larger container (preferably a steel salvage drum)and the overpack container should be properly relabeled. Alternately, thecontents of the damaged container may be transferred to a new container(i.e., repackaged) and then properly labeled. Before repackaging however,the owner/holder should contact the appropriate EPA regional office tolearn of any applicable State or local requirements. Overpacking or repackagingwill not generally jeopardize the award of a claimant's indemnity payment,provided that the claimant or holder adequately documents such repackagingand the outside of the package is clearly marked with information to identifythe contents. Additional guidance is provided in a short document on overpackingand repackaging dinoseb, available from the pesticide disposal staff atEPA headquarters (1-800-DIN-OSEB (in Maryland call 1-800-331-3704)).However, if a person is holding unused stocks with the clear intent ofdisposing of the stocks, he/she must comply with the requirements underSubtitle C of RCRA as specified in 40 CFR Parts 124, 261 through 266, and270. These requirements may differ from the storage requirements of FIFRA.Additionally, a storage permit may be required (See 40 CFR 270.13 through270.15).In general, the dinoseb storage area must be maintained to mitigate thethreat or the potential threat of release. In case of an emergency (severalleaking containers or a spill), the owner/holder should immediately contactthe appropriate EPA regional office listed in Unit II. D. In the eventof a release, the released product becomes a waste (unless it is capableof being recycled) which is subject to regulation under Subtitle C of RCRA.In particular, the person storing the dinoseb product that has been spilledmust clean up the spill and properly store, treat, or dispose of any resultantmaterials in accordance with the appropriate hazardous waste rules. Dry,absorbent materials such as absorptive clay, sand, sawdust, vermiculite,oil-dry, kitty litter, dry rags, or paper should be kept on hand for useas appropriate for the emergency cleanup of spills or leaks. Materialsthat are used for this purpose and become contaminated with dinoseb maythemselves be hazardous wastes and must be managed as such. If the holderof the product takes no action after a spill or release, EPA will takeappropriate action, including any enforcement action. In addition, theholder of the product may also be subject to liability under the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amendedby the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). EPA may perform inspections of materials in storage to determine if theabove conditions have been met. Further technical advice may be obtainedfrom the EPA regional office contacts listed in Unit II. D of this Notice.In addition, information on the storage provisions under FIFRA are availablefrom the pesticide disposal staff at EPA headquarters at 1-800-DIN-OSEB(in Maryland call 1-800-331-3704), and on the storage requirements underRCRA from the RCRA Hotline at 1-800-424-9346 or (202) 382-3000.B. Disposal Disposal of certain unused pesticide products may be subject to regulationas hazardous waste under RCRA. Under the existing hazardous waste rules,unused dinoseb product that has become a ``waste'' is regulated when discardedin commercial grade, technical grade, or off-specification form or if dinosebis the sole active ingredient in the formulation (hazardous waste designation``P020'') (See 40 CFR 261.33(e)). Discarded formulations containing dinosebas one of a number of active ingredients are presently not considered tobe hazardous wastes unless they exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste.A formulation is considered hazardous if it has one or more of the followingcharacteristics: 1. It is easily combustible. 2. It dissolves metals or other materials, or burns the skin. 3. It shows Extraction Procedure toxicity (contains high concentrationsof heavy metals or specific pesticides that could be released into groundwater).4. It is unstable or undergoes rapid or violent chemical reaction withwater or other materials. (See 40 CFR 261.20 through 261.24 for additionalinformation about these characteristics).Persons accumulating or possessing dinoseb in less than the quantitiesspecified in these regulations (1 kilogram or about 2 pounds per month)may be conditionally exempt from RCRA regulation. However, State hazardouswaste storage and disposal requirements may still apply.Under the hazardous waste rules, empty containers with minimal dinosebresidues as defined in 40 CFR 261.7 are exempt from regulation under RCRA.Specifically, containers that once contained dinoseb are considered tobe empty if they are triple-rinsed with an appropriate solvent (or cleanedby a method of equivalent effectiveness) or the container's inner linerhas been removed (See 40 CFR 261.7(b)(3)). However, the rinsate that isgenerated from this operation may be considered a hazardous waste underRCRA and must be managed in accordance with the appropriate managementstandards unless the person conducting the operation is a farmer. Specifically,a farmer disposing of such rinsate from a dinoseb container that was usedon his/her own farm is not subject to regulation under RCRA for those wastesprovided he/she triple rinses each emptied dinoseb container and disposesof the dinoseb residues on his/her own farm in a manner consistent withthe disposal instructions on the product label (See 40 CFR 262.70). Additionalinformation can be obtained from the RCRA Hotline (1-800-424-9346 or (202)382-3000).C. Transportation of Dinoseb StocksEPA has awarded contracts to two waste management firms for the disposalof dinoseb. It is the responsibility of the holder to handle and storethe material safely and transport it to EPA's designated facility whenthe Agency is ready to receive the stocks. EPA is preparing guidance fordinoseb owners/holders on transportation requirements. Holders should note,however, that proper transportation to EPA's acceptance site is the responsibilityof the holder and that transportation costs will be borne by the holder(See 40 CFR 165.5). Information obtained from holders responding to theApril 15, 1987 Notice has facilitated much progress on certain technicaland procedural issues including the recent award of contracts for disposal.Such early progress should expedite the ultimate disposal of all dinosebstocks for which EPA will be responsible. Additional information on schedulingshipments and transporting stocks to the EPA-designated acceptance siteis forthcoming. Any disposal of dinoseb independent of the federal disposalprogram must be conducted in accordance with all relevant local, Stateand Federal requirements. Documentation must be provided by submittingcertificates of destruction or other proof of proper disposal to the pesticidedisposal staff at EPA headquarters.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
