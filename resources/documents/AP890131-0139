Speaking to members of his Liberal Democratic Party hours beforeleaving on a weeklong U.S. trip, he said ``political reform is mytop priority.''   ``No matter how difficult, I will restore the people's trust ingovernment and earnestly work toward political reform,'' Takeshitasaid. ``I will thoroughly enforce discipline in my administrationand bring back public faith in it.''   For the last six months, Japanese politics has been rocked bydisclosures that top politicians or their aides profited from sharesin a real estate development firm because they bought them beforepublic trading. When the sales went public, the shares soared invalue.   The purchases of shares in the firm, a subsidiary of theinformation conglomerate Recruit Co., were not illegal but raisedquestions of political ethics, fund-raising and influence-peddling.   Three of Takeshita's Cabinet ministers have resigned in the lastthree months because they received political donations from Recruitor were linked to purchase of the shares.   ``In the wake of the Recruit problem, we have been subject tosevere criticism over political ethics,'' Takeshita said in hisspeech to the conservative party, which he addressed in his capacityas its president. ``Political reform should be the basis for allreform.''   He said he had assembled an advisory group on political reformthat has begun drawing up concrete measures to deal with the problem.   The political opposition calls the Recruit affair proof ofcorruption in the governing party, although a few oppositionpoliticians have also been implicated. The opposition has demandedthat the entire Cabinet step down and Takeshita call new elections,but he has refused.   In an editorial last week, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun said thescandal had damaged the image of politicians.   ``It does nothing but deepen the nation's political discredit,''the Asahi said. ``Takeshita must make clear to the people how hewill put an end to such a shameful political situation and takepolitical responsibility.''   The Liberal Democrats have been buffeted in both electoral andopinion polls in recent weeks.   A recent survey by Kyodo News Service showed support forTakeshita had plummeted from 53.4 percent in September to 35.9percent. A poll released Saturday by the Asahi put public support at28 percent, down from 57 percent a month earlier.   The party also suffered a setback in elections last weekend inKitakyushu, western Japan, where the opposition Socialists andCommunists made slight gains in municipal balloting.   Opposition politicians also claim a new tax package, whichintroduces a general consumption tax of 3 percent and lowerscorporate and higher-bracket income taxes, was steamrolled throughParliament and benefits the wealthy.   Also Tuesday, Takeshita disclosed his personal assets, saying hewas worth more than $1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
