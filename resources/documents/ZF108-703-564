 Yet, anincreasing number of federal contracts oblige them to comply with a set ofstandards called the Applications Portability Profile (APP) developed by theNational Institute of Standards and Technology.andM;Although APP is new, making government contracts more flexible has been arecurring problem for decades.andP;  Indeed, many legal challenges face thosetrying to adhere to standards using the typical government contractprocedures.andM;Ray Boileau, a law student at the University of Baltimore School of Law inMaryland, covers many of these legal issues in an unpublished paper on the&quot;Legal Basis for a Federal Contract Clause to Produce a Contractor Obligationto Meet the Government's Evovling IRM Standards.&quot;andM;The first of these challenges is the burden on the government to writeunambiguous specifications.andP;  As drafter of these contracts, the government issubject to the doctrine of contra proferentum.andM;When it comes to the language of government contracts, vendors must take itor leave it.andP;  In light of this advantage, the U.S.andP;  Supreme Court has foundthat &quot;a contract should be construed against the drafter.andP;  .  .  .&quot;andM;A lower court found that the contractor's interpretation will be adopted inthe absence of &quot;obvious error in drafting, a gross discrepancy, or aninadvertent but glaring gap.&quot;andM;Nevertheless, courts have held that contractors have the duty to inquire forclarification of potential problem areas.andP;  Contractors also are obliged towarn the government if the deliverable is impossible or would requireexcessive and unreasonable costs.andM;The government gas the right to make changes via a changes clause in acontract.andP;  But a &quot;cardinal change,&quot; an alteration in &quot;the nature of the thingto be constructed,&quot; may open the government to breach of contract suit andsubstantial damages.andM;Unfortunately, Boileau did not consider the role of vendor implementationagreements like those developed by the Open Systems InterconnectionImplementers Workshop sponsored by NIST.andM;A federal solicitation for OSI-compliant telecommunications systems isstrengthened by references to these implementer agreements.andM;Government agencies get this same advantage, and more, when they use theGovernment OSI Profile.andM;OSI product developers have negotiated the text of these agreements in apublic forum, so customers can assume more safely that the outcomes arepracticable.andP;  Because the feds are not the sole drafters, the risks ofambiguity are shifted somewhat toward the vendors.andM;And because modifications are made gradually and with broad industryconsensus, new versions of these agreements are unlikely to create cardinalchanges in contracts that cite them.andM;The task of achieving multivendor interoperability and portability is oftentoo complex to leave to the standards process.andP;  Implementation agreementsamong vendors not only are essential from a technical perspective, but theyalso help equitably distribute the uncertainty and risk between customer andsupplier.andM;In view of the length of system lives and contract life cycles, federalmanagers need to buy products compatible with current standards, not those ineffect when the solicitation was drafted.andM;Because these agreements spread the risk of changes in technology, NISTshould consider moving toward implementer agreements for other technologiesin the APP besides Open Systems Interconnection.andM;The bottom line is that federal contracts can be flexible, but the draftersmust be cautious about requiring the contractor to meet ill-defined futurerequirements.andM;Agencies are advised to understand and use in their solicitations NIST's APP,GOSIP and any implementer agreements available.andM;The closer one sticks to these documents, the stronger an agency's positionis if problem arise.andM;Walter R. Houser is responsible for information resources management andpolicy at a major federal agency.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
