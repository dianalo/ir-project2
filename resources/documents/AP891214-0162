Southern California air quality officials view the proposedstate regulations, designed to reduce statewide auto emissions byas much as two-thirds, as a crucial part in their efforts to meetfederal clean air standards by the year 2007.   California motorists would be the first in the nation able toswitch to low-polluting cars under the plan, which was formallyunveiled at a meeting of the California Air Resources Board.   All fuel sources, including new gasolines, methanol, compressednatural gas, propane, ethanol and electricity, would be permittedas long as vehicles meet stricter emissions standards, officialssaid.   The resources board, in calling for the standards, seeks tostretch to new lengths its longtime campaign to force automakersand fuel companies to advance their anti-pollution technology.   ``In the past we have regulated the car industry and the fuelindustry,'' board spokesman Bill Sessa said Thursday. ``This isreally an effort to regulate them at the same time. It will requirean uncommon amount of cooperation between car and fuel makers andother energy suppliers to reach the goals we are targeting.''   No action was taken during the hearing, held at the downtownstate office building, as the board begins gathering reaction fromvarious groups, including the Western States Petroleum Association,Pacific Gas andamp; Electric, Southern California Gas Co. and Ford andGeneral Motors and others.   The board will review the draft proposal, which was formulatedby staff after consultation workshops with the auto and fuelindustries, Sessa said.   A final draft of the pollution-cutting plan was expected byJuly, with a board vote possible in September.   The proposal calls for oil and auto companies to join forces todevelop new engines and fuels that produce fewer contaminatingemissions.   The plan also calls for about 10 percent of all new cars sold inCalifornia each year between 1994 and 1996 to be cleaner-fuelmodels.   In 1997, one-quarter of new cars would have to operate on thecleaner fuels. The quota would increase to half of cars sold in1998, and to 98 percent in 2000.   Automakers have complained that cars using methanol costhundreds of dollars more to operate than those using gasoline.   ``There are many ways to meet the standards, through acombination of things, such as a superior grade of gasoline withadvanced catalyst systems, or perhaps with lower technology enginescoupled with cleaner burning alternative fuels such as methanol ornatural gas,'' Sessa said.   But citing uncertainties in developing new technologies, autocompany officials said before Thursday's meeting they planned toask the agency to postpone its compliance deadlines.   ``This is going at such an unprecedented pace. My fear is thatthey will adopt rules that can't be achieved,'' said Mike Schwarz,Ford Motor Co.'s manager of emissions control in Detroit.   Schwarz said cleaner-fuel cars could be introduced to stateconsumers in 1994 or 1995. But he said the auto industry needs atleast until 1997 to meet any quotas.   Sessa, however, said the deadlines were reasonable.   ``There will be much more discussion before a firm proposal, butwe're confiden t that these deadlines could be met, based ontesting of prototype cars ,'' he said.   Some 1 billion gallons of the cleaner fuel would have to bemarketed in 1997, increasing to about 11 billion gallons in 2006,according to the plan.</TEXT></DOC>
