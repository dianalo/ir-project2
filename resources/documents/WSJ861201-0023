That advantage is disappearing, however, and major oil companies' earnings in the current quarter are expected to be smaller than in preceding quarters.    &quot;The pendulum has swung,&quot; warns Philip L. Dodge, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. Oil product prices and refining profits once again are depressed by hefty inventories.    The outlook is for smaller profits from the &quot;downstream,&quot; or refining and marketing, end of the oil business. Frederick P. Leuffer, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., calculates that major oil company earnings from domestic downstream operations fell 22% on average in the third quarter from the second quarter and that earnings from foreign downstream operations fell 32% in the same period. &quot;Early signs point to further erosion of a similar magnitude in the fourth quarter,&quot; says Mr. Leuffer.    Among the warning signals are bulging inventories of refined products in the U.S., which at the end of October stood at 760.9 million barrels, 10% more than a year earlier and 14% more than stocks in April, the low point this year.    The bigger inventories resulted from increased refinery output. &quot;We have overshot, filled up our inventories, and driven down prices,&quot; says Dixon Smith, general manager for operations and business at Chevron Corp.'s Chevron USA unit in San Francisco.    For a while, the gyrations of oil prices made for very profitable times in refining and marketing. At Exxon Corp., for instance, after-tax earnings from refining and marketing more than quadrupled to $1.64 billion and accounted for 42% of the company's $3.88 billion net income for the first nine months of 1986, compared with 13% of the $3.07 billion net of the nine-month period a year earlier. New York-based Exxon's revenue in the latest period totaled $57.41 billion against $68.53 billion a year earlier.    The price of petroleum products trailed the descent of crude oil prices for much of this year. &quot;Many retail markets tend to respond slowly to changes in the price of a raw material,&quot; says Philip Verleger, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank.    The gap that opened up was vast in this case. According to figures of the Energy Information Agency, an arm of the Energy Department, profits from refining operations at U.S. facilities averaged $3.87 a barrel of oil refined this May, up from 51 cents in January. From that peak in May, profits slid to $1.01 in September, the latest period for which full calculations are available.    &quot;It appears that October and November weren't much changed from September,&quot; says Robert A. Speir, director of publications and analysis in the petroleum marketing arm of the Energy Department. Mr. Speir estimates that refinery profits sagged to 72 cents a barrel in October and rallied slightly to $1.06 last month.    At the peak, profits were even more spectacular in Europe, where tighter market controls kept refined product prices up longer and where the plunging U.S. dollar added a currency advantage for oil companies that buy oil in U.S. dollars but sell the products in local currencies, which have been increasing in value relative to the U.S. dollar.    &quot;Graphs of refinery margins this year look like the Matterhorn,&quot; says Paul Mlotok, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.    What put the margins on the downward slope in recent months was a squeeze. After falling from an average of $25.64 a barrel in January to a low of $11.51 a barrel in June, refiners' costs of crude oil turned upward, to an estimated $13.28 a barrel last month. At the same time, the average value of products refined from a barrel of crude oil has fallen from $21.18 in June to an estimated $19.96 last month.    The effect on profits will be plain. Mr. Leuffer, of Cyrus J. Lawrence, for instance, estimates that this squeeze will contribute to a slide in net at Chevron to 22 cents a share in the current quarter from 61 cents in the third quarter and from $1.75 in last year's fourth quarter. He expects net income at Exxon to slide to $1.14 a share from $1.46 in the third quarter and from $2.43 in last year's fourth quarter.    Mr. Leuffer sees Texaco Inc., White Plains, N.Y., about breaking even, after earning 67 cents a share in the third quarter and $1.29 a share in the fourth quarter of 1985.    Not all oil companies will show a decline in fourth-quarter earnings from the third quarter, Mr. Leuffer says. He expects New York-based Mobil Corp.'s earnings to increase to 70 cents a share from 45 cents a share in the third quarter but to be down from $1.04 a share in the fourth quarter of 1985. Similarly, he estimates that Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings will rise to $2.78 a share from $1.84 a share in the third quarter. The company, based in The Hague, Netherlands, had earnings of $3.26 a share in the 1985 fourth quarter. Mr. Leuffer says that earnings for both Mobil and Royal Dutch are affected by nonrecurring items.    With the prospect of low downstream prices and low crude prices, &quot;it doesn't look good on either side,&quot; says Chevron's Mr. Smith.    A jump in crude oil prices could actually depress oil company earnings in the first quarter next year, says Mr. Leuffer. &quot;It would wreak havoc with first-quarter earnings if OPEC actually gets the $18 a barrel price it's looking for because product prices are very unlikely to catch up with the higher crude oil price in the quarter,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
