<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-04-1196 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors previously predicted very low thermally induced brine migrationvelocity in a salt repository after the salt has consolidated againstthe waste package - so low that radionuclide release into the consolidatedsalt is expected to occur largely by molecular diffusion of species inbrine in the salt grain boundaries. In this paper they present estimatesof radionuclide release rates from waste packages into salt. This analysisshows that for the parameter values selected here, and for containmenttimes of andgt; 300 yr, release rates from individual waste packages in saltcan meet the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) performance objectivefor the engineered barrier system. If the container fails shortly afteremplacement, the release rate for {sup 137}Cs is exceeded for up to 300yr.</TEXT></DOC>
