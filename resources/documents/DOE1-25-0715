<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-0715 </DOCNO><TEXT>Single pellet injection experiments have been carried out on TFR in Ohmicconditions, aiming at an improvement of the experimental knowledge ofablation physical processes and also at a better description of the heatand matter transport during and after pellet evaporation. Ablation cloudshave been photographed, providing experimental penetration depths inrough agreement with the neutral shielding model. Observation of striationsin the cloud has led to an experimental determination of the safety factorprofile. The plasma parameters in the ablation cloud have been determinedspectroscopically. Fast heat transport has been evidenced during pelletevaporation ({similar_to}100 {mu}s), which exhibits some features ofminor or major disruptions (appearance of an m = 1, n = 1 island on theq = 1 surface, bursts of density fluctuations, comparable heat diffusivity,etc.). Matter transport takes place on a larger time-scale ({similar_to}10ms). This long temporal relaxation is well accounted for by the MAKOKOT1-D transport code with the same dependence of the transport coefficientson the plasma parameters before and after pellet injection. Heat andmatter transports are affected by the presence of the m = 1, n = 1 islandon the q = 1 surface. (author). 50 refs, 28 figs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
