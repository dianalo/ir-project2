Even the sternestcritic of Mexico can no longer deny the success of PresidentCarlos Salinas's macroeconomic policies.</LP><TEXT>   Liberalization of tariffs and investment laws have led toa boom of foreign direct investment, which reached a record$4.4 billion in 1990. The bulls on Mexico's increasingly opencapital markets continue to reign, leading to anotherdoubling in value of the stock market over the past year,with 22 new issues placed so far this year. Non-oil exportsincreased 18% last year, despite complaints from exportersthat the peso is overvalued against the dollar. Flightcapital is flowing back to Mexico, much of it used to buy upprivatized government assets. Privatization means a reductionof government spending and the addition of more than $14billion dollars to a contingency fund earmarked to amortizingthe internal debt. All this has helped balance the budget andboost Mexico's cash reserves to $16.3 billion.   Of course, the treasury's new riches bring back some badmemories. The last time Mexico was flush -- in the easy-loanera of the late 1970s -- the money was squandered byfast-spending politicians. Today, however, rather than merelydividing up the country's riches, the Salinas administrationhas embarked on a program meant to shore up the economy andencourage wealth creation at every level of Mexican society.&quot;Yes, we've dramatically increased the investment climate forforeign investments,&quot; says Mr. Aspe. &quot;We had to reverse thedecline. But now is the time to expand the entrepreneurialbase and broaden the middle class in Mexico. This is Mr.Salinas's deepest commitment: of going from a dominant poornation to a dominant middle-class nation.&quot;   One of the clearest signs of this commitment came with thebudget presented to congress on Nov. 15. From the countrysideto the cities the budget is aimed at turning Mexico'smarginally productive workforce into full participants in itsincreasingly global marketplace, turning an impoverishedliability into an asset.   The most revolutionary change in the budget -- botheconomically and politically -- is the plan to reform the&quot;ejido&quot; land tenure system, which has kept most Mexicanfarmers dirt poor and prevented any meaningful exploitationof Mexico's agricultural export capability.   Established by a constitutional article after the 1910revolution, ejidos were designed to prevent exploitation ofpeasants by feudal land owners at a time when most Mexicanslived in the countryside (currently, fewer than 30% ofMexicans do). Large land holdings were expropriated by thestate and divided among millions of peasants, who wereorganized into ejido collectives by the ruling InstitutionalRevolutionary Party (PRI). But ejido members are not allowedto sell, rent or mortgage their small plots of land.Diseconomies of scale and lack of personal incentives haveforced Mexico to import food it should be exporting and ledto heavy subsidization of inefficient farms.   There is a political dimension to the ejido structure, aswell. Implicit in restrictions of ownership is the necessarydependence of ejido members on government to provide economicand social services. To quote an unpublished report on theejido by a government ministry: &quot;Through the ejido system,the government provided a paternalistic structure whichserved as an umbrella under which ejidatarios {ejido members}operated.&quot; Members of the opposition are more specific. &quot;Theejidos replaced one &quot;cacique&quot; {feudal lord} with PRIcaciques,&quot; says Luis Alvarez, from the National Action Party.   If Mr. Salinas's initiative to amend the constitutionsucceeds, ejido members will be guaranteed titles for theirplots, with which they will be able to do as they please.&quot;The operative word is `choice,'&quot; says PRI president, LuisDonaldo Colosio. &quot;If they want to remain as members of theejido commune, that would be fine. But if ejido membersprefer to operate as a joint venture with a large companythat can better exploit the farm land, so be it.&quot;   The possibility of such joint ventures has already beenrealized in Mr. Salinas's home state of Nuevo Leon. There, ina town called Vaquerias, a large cookie company called Gamesaentered into a 12-year agreement with ejidos and severalsmall landholders last year. In exchange for capital,equipment and training, ejido members provide the land andlabor for a chance to share equally in profits. The jointventure took an even more interesting twist late last yearwhen Gamesa was acquired for $320 million by PepsiCo, openingup the possibilities of an infusion of foreign capital tospur Mexico's agricultural production. &quot;In agriculture,&quot; saysMr. Aspe, &quot;we're going to see the most important economicboom of all as we finally give people choice while feedingour people.&quot;   Addressing the needs of the cities is an even moredaunting task than reforming the agricultural sector.Nevertheless, the potential rewards -- especially thepotential of Mexico's huge underground economy -- are just asgreat. According to a recent survey by the NationalConfederation of Manufacturing Chambers, those employed inthe underground economy amount to 22.5% of Mexico's activeworkforce (5.7 million people). Another substantial portionof the workforce exists in a kind of &quot;gray&quot; economy. Deputyminister of finance for taxation Francisco Gil Diaz says thatmany companies pay up to 50% of workers' salaries in untaxed&quot;fringe benefits,&quot; most frequently in cash.   The main reason for all this underground economic activityis excessive taxation and regulation. Mexico's top rate onpersonal income is now 35% and kicks in at about $9,000 peryear. This is a big improvement over the 60% rate in effectjust four years ago, but workers must also deduct from theirsalaries 7% in social security payments, a 5% &quot;worker'shousing fund&quot; and several other smaller deductions. DavidGoldman, of the New Jerseybased firm Polyconomics, estimatesthat collected revenues are only 15% of what they would be ifthe government enacted lower rates and simplified the taxcode. In addition, since most small companies rely on savingsto get started, there's no telling how many new businessescould be created if well-paid workers were free to keep andinvest more of their earnings.   In its new budget, the government has proposed to draw theworst paid workers back into the formal economy by cuttingthe tax rate on those earning less than five times theminimum salary ($20 a day) in half. In addition, thevalue-added tax is to be cut, to 10% from 15%. Moreover, Mr.Gil Diaz has a proposal to lower tax rates on more highlypaid workers if their &quot;bonuses&quot; are included in taxableincome.   In one of the few lapses in the supplyside logic of thisadministration, Mr. Aspe and his team continue to support a35% capital gains tax on the grounds that it helps modernizethe economy. The theory is that since dividends (from profitsalready taxed at the corporate rate) are not subject tocapital gains tax, tightly-held family businesses will betempted to open their books and jump into the capitalmarkets. Nevertheless, both Messrs. Aspe and Gil Diaz admitthat the growth potential of removing this barrier to capitaldevelopment may outweigh the relatively minor income theyreceive from the capital gains tax. (It should also bementioned that capital gains made in agricultural productionwill be taxed at 17.5% -- half the normal rate -- to spuragricultural investments.)   While Mexico's investment climate continues to improve,even optimistic Mexicans urge caution. &quot;We understandexternal optimism, but we can't share in it completely,&quot; saysAlejandro Junco, owner of a Monterrey newspaper and a capitalmarkets information service. &quot;There is a sense that thegovernment doesn't entirely trust competitive forces. Theystill parcel out concessions to individuals -- often withmonopoly rights -- rather than opening the market. Forexample, as regards information services, they say: `We grantAlejandro a special privilege for which he must be grateful,'rather than letting all Mexicans compete based on the qualityof their product or service.&quot;   The slow dismantling of bureaucratic controls of theinternal market naturally frustrates local entrepreneurs. Andthe transition from a highly protected market to one in whichthe true value of products are reflected in the price of astrong, reliable currency exacts a toll on establishedindustry. Nevertheless, what is most impressive about theSalinas growth plan is its emphasis on self-reliance ratherthan dependence -- from the largest enterprise to thesmallest.   At the lowest end of the economic scale, the self-reliancephilosophy is reflected in a work-fare poverty program called&quot;Solidarity.&quot; Despite an overall decline in domestic spending(due primarily to a lowering of internal debt service) thenew budget calls for a doubling of spending on the Solidaritycampaign. Solidarity projects for potable water, schools,sewage plants, etc. are designed in rough form by localresidents who are then given technical and materialassistance by the federal government. But the residentsthemselves must provide the work to complete the project.   Chalco is a slum of perhaps a half million people justsouth of Mexico City. Open sewage drains flow just outsidethe open windows of many shanties. Approximately half of thepopulation is unemployed. Yet the community is busy at workon dozens of Solidarity projects, even on a holiday. &quot;Thedifference between Solidarity and past poverty projects,&quot;says Chalco's Solidarity coordinator Tomas Cruz Martinez, &quot;isthat we are responsible for the projects to improve ourlives. In the past, we had to rely on the government, as ifit was our &quot;patron&quot; {protector}. There was no pride. Now weonly get what we work for. And we prefer it that way.&quot;   ---   Mr. Asman edits the Journal's Americas column.</TEXT></DOC>
