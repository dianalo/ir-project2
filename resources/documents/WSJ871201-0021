If there's a U.S. recession in 1988, bearish analysts say, earnings estimates for some economically sensitive companies could be cut by 30% to 50% and their stocks could get clobbered.    Yesterday's downturn was occasioned partly by bearish newspaper stories over the holiday weekend on the U.S. economy and by renewed pressure on the U.S. dollar. It wasn't confined to cyclical stocks, of course. But many recently popular stocks that were supposed to benefit in 1988 from stronger commodity prices or a weaker dollar -- including Phelps Dodge, Reynolds Metals and Bowater -- surrendered about 10% of their value, much more than the market.    &quot;You have one group of investors that sees inflation tapping at the door,&quot; says Frank Kelly, an E.F. Hutton trader, &quot;while the other sees recession around the corner.&quot; Apparently, the latter group was in ascendancy yesterday.    In the rush to get out, trading opened late and sharply lower in some cyclical stocks -- a reminder that the market hasn't been very liquid since the crash. Caterpillar, for instance, was off 2 1/8 to 57 3/4 on an opening trade of 90,000 shares. It closed at 56 3/4, off 3 1/8. Reynolds Metals opened 3 1/4 lower at 43 on 84,000 shares. It closed at 41 1/2, despite announcing a $1.1 billion debt refinancing pact late yesterday that, it said, &quot;will improve its financial structure.&quot;    &quot;These were some of the preeminent cyclical stocks,&quot; says Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst at Salomon Brothers.    Caterpillar's treasurer, Len Kuchan, was puzzled by the sell-off of the company's shares. &quot;Normally, with the dollar going lower, Caterpillar would be stable or even higher,&quot; he says. The bet on concerns like Caterpillar is that the weak dollar will boost their exports and increase their share of the U.S. market.    Despite investors' bearishness yesterday, Mr. Kuchan says orders for the company's mining and construction equipment are &quot;holding steady at high levels.&quot; Caterpillar isn't losing market share and expects to do better in 1988 than in 1987, he adds.    There were rumors yesterday that an analyst had taken Phelps Dodge off his buy list. But Kim Sterling, a shareholder relations officer, couldn't confirm them. She said the company's chairman, Robert Durham, will meet analysts today in New York for what should be &quot;an upbeat presentation.&quot;    &quot;If you envisage a recession, you should avoid all cyclical stocks,&quot; says Clarence Morrison, a Dean Witter metals analyst. If the economy stalls, many industrial concerns would have much lower earnings and maybe deficits, analysts say.    Pete Ingersoll, a Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst, says Phelps Dodge could earn $340 million, or $11 a share, in 1988 -- much more than twice its projected 1987 profit -- if copper prices hold at current levels of about $1.15 a pound. But if copper falls to 85 cents a pound, the company would earn $6 a share, he says.    Mr. Ingersoll isn't expecting a recession. But if there is one, he says, price-earnings ratios for copper companies &quot;would be cut in half,&quot; making the stocks look expensive at current levels. Analysts say Magma Copper, a high-cost producer, would be even more vulnerable than Phelps Dodge, the industry leader.    In 1982, a recession year, Mr. Ingersoll says, world copper consumption fell almost 6%. Copper prices fell 50% from their peak and the industry in 1982 racked up hundreds of million of dollars in losses. He notes that Phelps Dodge had &quot;huge swings&quot; from 1979's peak earnings of more than $100 million to 1984's biggest loss of $268 million.    &quot;That's why they call them cyclical stocks,&quot; says Dean Witter's Mr. Morrison.    To be sure, analysts say, the damage wouldn't be nearly as great in any future recession because industrial companies generally in recent years have grown leaner and have slashed production capacity. Because of tight copper supplies, for instance, copper prices have doubled in less than a year, analysts say.    Moreover, not all metals concerns are equally vulnerable to recession. While copper companies are tied to the construction industry, which is recession-sensitive, aluminum producers have stable demand from the packaging industry that makes them more immune to recession, says Peter Anker, a First Boston analyst.    In 1982, he says, aluminum shipments fell about 10% and almuninum prices tumbled because of a buildup in inventories. But this time around, he says, inventories are so low that even a 10% fall in shipments wouldn't create an &quot;inventory overhang.&quot; Mr. Anker thinks &quot;it would be O.K. to own&quot; aluminum stocks such as Reynolds, Aluminum Co. of America and Amax in a mild recession.    Ken Heebner, a Loomis Sayles money manager who has a lot riding on copper, aluminum and steel stocks, says he can't see any evidence of softening in the economy that justifies selling cyclicals. &quot;We're in a market environment where selling is compulsive,&quot; he says.    Industrial stocks since the Oct. 19 crash have had &quot;such a run&quot; that it's natural for investors to take profit, adds Jack Baker, a senior trader at Shearson. Caterpillar has gained 40% since the crash and Phelps Dodge, almost 100%.    But to hold metal stocks currently, says Shearson's Mr. Ingersoll, &quot;you have to assume an up economy&quot; in 1988. &quot;If you don't,&quot; he says, the bulls on cyclicals, himself included, &quot;will be dead wrong.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
