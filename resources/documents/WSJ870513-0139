Mr. Vitale, 53 years old, is the main U.S.-based executive of Bertelsmann AG, whose interests here include RCA/Ariola Records and Bantam Books. Six months ago, Bertelsmann paid a hefty $500 million for Doubleday andamp; Co., a major U.S. publisher fallen on hard times. The move tripled Bertelsmann's U.S. publishing revenue to more than $700 million annually, and put it in a position to compete more aggressively in the U.S. with such giants as Gulf andamp; Western's Simon andamp; Schuster unit and Advance Publications Inc.'s Random House unit.    Mr. Vitale, who rose at Bantam to become its chief executive officer last year, has the formidable task of bolstering Doubleday's sagging fortunes and integrating it with the younger, more aggressive Bantam Books. Now chief executive of the combined Doubleday/Bantam/Dell Publishing Group, Mr. Vitale says his goal is to wring 10% to 15% annual profit growth out of the U.S. book business.    It's no easy task. While Bantam has had admirable success expanding from a paperback house to a formidable hard-cover publisher, Doubleday had losses during most of the 1980s; it earned only $7 million on sales of $472.3 million in the year before Bertelsmann's acquisition. The family-owned company had a reputation for cronyism, and had been hurt by a revolving door in its editorial and executive suites. Doubleday has an impressive backlist of titles, and publishes 500 or so new ones annually, including best sellers such as Bill Cosby's &quot;Fatherhood&quot; last year. But it had lost some popular authors like Kurt Vonnegut and Barbara Taylor Bradford.    During the past five months, Mr. Vitale has overseen a sweeping reorganization, dismissing several top Doubleday executives, naming three new president/publishers to the individual units of the new publishing group, and asking 600 of Doubleday's approximately 4,000 employees to take early retirement. He merged overlapping sales staffs and consolidated warehouses and computer processing operations.    While the moves have been unsettling for Doubleday employees, Mr. Vitale says they are crucial to improving the group's prospects. &quot;We had to do away with a lot of corporate overhead, rationalize and consolidate all the services, take away all the frills and just do what is essential to run a top-notch, quality company,&quot; he says.    Industry executives still question whether Bertelsmann will ever justify the high price it paid for Doubleday. But Mr. Vitale argues that despite its financial condition, Doubleday has assets and franchises that were uniquely suited to Bertelsmann's needs. For example, Bertelsmann is the world's largest book-club operator, and Doubleday includes a leading U.S. book club, the Literary Guild.    Doubleday also provided Bertelsmann with much-needed U.S. book-manufacturing operations. Moreover, Mr. Vitale says it's worth a premium to get a foothold in the U.S. market. &quot;If you are in publishing, the only market with large numbers is the English-speaking market,&quot; he says.    Mr. Vitale says he wants to &quot;extend the Bantam know-how and expertise&quot; to Doubleday. Bantam is highly regarded among booksellers for good marketing and distribution, while Doubleday's reputation in those pivotal areas had deteriorated badly. Bantam has also has had considerable success using television promotion for books and persuading supermarkets to sell hardcovers. But the chief executive of one rival publishing firm warns, &quot;you have to worry about how much resources are being siphoned off from Bantam to shore up Doubleday.&quot;    Born in Vercelli, Italy, and raised in Italy and Cairo, Egypt, Mr. Vitale was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Graduate School of Finance. He started his career at Italian office-equipment maker Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. and its U.S. subsidiary, and later joined the Agnelli family's Istituto Finanziario Industriale, the holding company with ties to Fiat. The company purchased Bantam in 1974; Mr. Vitale joined the publisher and came along when Bertelsmann bought it a few years later.    Mr. Vitale, who mainly reads business books such as &quot;Iacocca: An Autobiography,&quot; and Louis L'Amour's Western novels, says he relies on editorial executives to choose books. Each imprint -- Bantam, Doubleday and Dell -- will retain its independence, he says.    His most controversial hire was Nancy Evans, editor of Time Inc.'s Book of the Month Club, who Mr. Vitale named president and publisher of Doubleday. As a former book club executive, Ms. Evans's experience is primarily in picking already published books rather than finding new manuscripts.    But Mr. Vitale, whose experience is largely financial and administrative, says Ms. Evans's previous job gives her &quot;an excellent sense of what works and what doesn't work in the market.&quot;    He also named Dell Vice President Carol Baron as president and selected Linda Grey, a Bantam executive, as his successor there.    Ms. Grey calls her boss &quot;extremely supportive&quot; and willing to take risks because &quot;he knows that while you never put yourself in a position of outrageous financial jeopardy, sometimes there are things more important than the bottom line, such as the quality and identity of the publishing house.&quot;    Mr. Vitale dismisses industry concerns that foreign owners will misjudge the U.S. market and try to influence publishing decisions. &quot;A foreign publisher affords you more freedom than an (American) one because they have to rely more on you,&quot; he says. If there were much meddling, he adds, &quot;they wouldn't have a person working for them.&quot; He says, &quot;the thing we cherish most is our independence.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
