This equation is compatible with the hydrodynamicequations of a plasma. It yields a very accurate description of the nonlocalnature of the release of fusion energy. The diffusion coefficient andthe dissipation coefficient which appear in this equation are calculatedfor five basic products of the reactions of the D-D cycle. It is shownhow the diffusion approximation can be reduced to an even simpler approximationof an {alpha}-particle thermal conductivity.</TEXT></DOC>
