Administration and industry officials told a House MerchantMarine and Fisheries subcommittee Tuesday that more research isnecessary to determine what impact the by-products of a degradableholder would have on marine life. But the environmentalists saylegislation is needed quickly to save seabirds and marine mammalsthat are killed by the discarded plastic rings.   Albert M. Manville II, a biologist for Defenders of Wildlife andchairman of the Entanglement Network coalition, said plasticsix-pack containers can remain in the environment for ``hundreds,perhaps thousands of years,'' killing wildlife that becomeentangled and choke to death, or mistake the yokes for food andstrangle or die from starvation.   ``The six-pack ring epitomizes the plastic pollution problem _ ahighly successful product that is functional and durable, and yetugly and deadly when improperly discarded,'' said Rep. Gerry E.Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee on fisheries andwildlife conservation.   But Sylvia Lowrance, director of the Environmental ProtectionAgency's solid waste division, warned that the proposed law has``the potential for replacing one problem with another.'' And shenoted that even degradable yokes can stay in the environment forseveral months before breaking down.   Robert Smith, deputy assistant director at the Fish and WildlifeService, said his agency opposes the legislation because ``we donot have information that indicates six-pack yokes are a majorthreat to fish and wildlife resources.''   ``They probably are not a major threat to wildlife population,''Smith said.   Environmentalists disagreed with that assertion and urgedimmediate action.   ``Enough is enough,'' said Manville. ``When is there sufficientinformation?   ``The majority of what is seen and reported involves animals onshore. These reports probably represent only a fraction of what isentangling fish and wildlife on the open oceans.''   The United States produced 10 million tons of plastic waste in1986, about 7 percent of the 158 million ton total, according toLowrance. Projections show the plastic trash total rising to 16million tons by the turn of the century.   The bill by Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., was passed by theSenate in May and is pending before Studds' subcommittee and theHouse Energy and Commerce subcommittee on transportation andtourism.   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the commercesubcommittee, said ``there may be reason to question the need forcongressional action'' in light of states' responses.   Sixteen states have enacted similar laws, beginning with Vermontin 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
