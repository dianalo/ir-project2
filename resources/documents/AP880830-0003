(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaking rocket fuelforced the evacuation of a Titan 2 launch pad during the weekend,the Air Force said Tuesday.   The Air Force declined to confirm whether the mishap Sundaydelayed the classified launch of four Navy spy satellites.   John Pike, a space policy expert at the Washington-basedFederation of American Scientists, said last week that a classifiedTitan 2 launch was expected soon.   He said the one-time intercontinental ballistic missile, in itsmaiden flight as a space booster, was almost certain to carry intoorbit a set of four White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance Systemsatellites designed to eavesdrop on radio and radar transmissionsby the Soviet fleet.   The Air Force and Martin Marietta Corp. have previously saidthat Space Launch Complex 4 West will be used to launch refurbishedTitan 2s carrying military payloads.   ``We had a minor vapor escape of monomethyl hydrazine at SpaceLaunch Complex 4 West this weekend,'' said Capt. John Sullivan, aspokesman for the Air Force Space and Missile Test Organization atthis military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.   ``The leak was detected by our sensors and the pad was evacuatedwith our safety procedures,'' he added. ``The vapor dispersedharmlessly into the atmosphere. At no time was there any danger tothe base or community population'' in nearby Vandenberg Village orthe neighboring city of Lompoc.   Sullivan emphasized the leak wasn't serious, but said he didn'tknow how many people were evacuated from the launch pad.   He also declined comment on whether a Titan 2 was being loadedwith the hydrazine fuel to prepare it for a classified launch.   For about 25 years, Titan 2 rockets served as ICBMs, eachcarrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead. Maintenance and safetyproblems spurred removal of the obsolete missiles from their silosin Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona.   The Air Force has ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as spaceboosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Mariettabecause it was cheaper than building new rockets.</TEXT></DOC>
