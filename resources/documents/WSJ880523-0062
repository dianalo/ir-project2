A prosecution lawyer said the charge of conspiracy to defraud shareholders and creditors of Carrian Investments Ltd. was dropped because of potential time conflicts with another criminal trial that Mr. Tan is likely to face.    Mr. Tan, grinning broadly, hadn't any comment after leaving court.    The charge arose when Carrian collapsed in 1983. A trial last September of Mr. Tan and several others on a charge of alleged falsification of investment accounts ended in acquittal.    Mr. Tan still faces 23 criminal charges in a separate fraud and corruption case arising from his dealings with Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd., a Hong Kong unit of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. </TEXT></DOC>
