HAMM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department sought a temporaryrestraining order Wednesday in an attempt to stop the District ofColumbia from barring newly sentenced prisoners from itsovercrowded jail facilities.   The department filed suit in U.S. District Court after thedistrict failed to accept the federal government's offer ofshort-term help to alleviate jail overcrowding in exchange for acommitment by the district to quickly increase its space forhousing prisoners.   The offer by Associate Attorney General Frank Keating would haveassigned to federal prison facilities up to 200 newly sentencedpeople. That offer would have lasted until Oct. 14, and the citywould have resumed accepting prisoners Oct. 17. Under the offer,the people temporarily housed in federal facilities from Oct. 4 toOct. 14 would have been returned to the district by Jan. 1.   The city had until 3:30 p.m. Wednesday to accept the offer anddid not do so, said a statement issued by the Justice Department.Federal prisons now hold nearly 2,000 city prisoners.   The crisis was triggered last Thursday, when U.S. District JudgeWilliam B. Bryant's ordered the Corrections Department to complywith a court-ordered inmate cap at the jail. He gave the District afive-day grace period before the decree took effect at noon Tuesday.   An appeals court decision, handed down the same day as Bryant'sruling, requires the Corrections Department to bring the populationat the overcrowded Central Facility at Lorton, Va. in line with acourt-ordered cap by Nov.1.   The D.C. Department of Corrections closed its overcrowded prisonsystem to new inmates Tuesday to comply with the court order, andplaced responsibility for housing them in the hands of the attorneygeneral.   In a six-page letter to Washington Mayor Marion Barry, Keatingsaid the pace of new prison construction in the District ``has beentotally inadequate.''   ``The District has been unwilling to take the obvious emergencymeasure of placing on vacant sites within the District the modularfacilities which other jurisdictions have used to provide quickaccommodations for excess prison populations,'' said Keating.   The city submitted a report to Bryant on Wednesday morningexplaining its plan for reducing the jail population, a spokeswomanfor Bryant said.   In addition to closing the prison system, the city announcedplans to release 350 inmates early, transfer 130 to penalinstitutions in other states, and hire contractors to post bond forsome indigent inmates awaiting trial.   District of Columbia and federal officials met for hoursWednesday in an unsuccessful effort to resolve their differences.   Meanwhile, the D.C. police department's traffic branch holdingcell was turned over to the Department of Corrections to house someprisoners temporarily, according to police spokesman Joe Gentile.And police station houses were placed on alert to prepare to acceptoverflow prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
