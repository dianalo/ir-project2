The arrests sent ``a very clear political and economic signalthat this administration is stronger than the last,'' said AbelBeltran del Rio, director of Ciemex-Wefa, a consulting firm thatspecializes in Mexican economics.   To expedite his plans, Salinas needs to make the once-wild stockmarket ``a clean, healthy conduit for local and foreign investors tofinance Mexican investment and generate jobs,'' del Rio said in aninterview from the firm's offices in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.   The arrests on illegal trading charges stem from the 1987 crash,which exposed the Mexican stock market as one of the world's mostfreewheeling and fraudulent bourses. Hundreds of investorscomplained their money was squandered by unscrupulous traders innearly all the country's 25 brokerages.   The crackdown on white collar crime deflected criticism thatSalinas' government is anti-labor, charges incited by anotheranti-corruption campaign begun in January against the powerfulMexican Oil Workers Union.   Among the stockbrokers seized last week was Eduardo Legorreta,board chairman and co-founder of Operadora de Bolsa and one ofMexico's wealthiest businessmen, nabbed by federal agents at aMexico City restaurant.   Legorreta, known as one of the nation's most aggressive brokers,was charged with trading in expired Treasury bills, investingwithout clients' knowledge and falsifying clients' trading records.   Gustavo Diaz, president of an investors' association, estimatedcorrupt brokers netted $43.3 million in profits from illegaltrading, while Cesar Fentanes Mendez, an attorney, said stockholderslost more than $21 million through fraud. The government itself hasnot revealed a figure.   Up to 148 more stockbrokers face administrative sanctions _including lifetime trading bans _ for other irregularities,according to stock exchange president Alfredo Harp Helu.   The Salinas-led shakedown against both the stockbrokers and oilunionists broke new ground for Mexican presidents, who had largelyignored questionable activities by these groups before.   Alfonso Martinez Dominguez, a former president of the governingInstitutional Revolutionary Party, welcomed the Salinas effort,saying, ``In our country there are no distinctions toward anyclass.''   Samuel del Villar, a political scientist with the Colegio deMexico and adviser to former President Miguel de la Madrid, saidSalinas moved against the oil workers and brokers because boththreatened his economic program.   ``Corruption is worst where the economic activity is moststrategic _ and in Mexico that means petroleum and the stockmarket,'' del Villar said. ``The brokerage firms, like the oilworkers union, weren't filling a productive role in the economy.''   Both the Mexican stock exchange and securities commission lastweek said they planned to tighten supervision, including anautomated reporting system that would leave a paper trail ofquestionable trades.   Despite the campaign for a clean market, critics still argue thegovernment has failed to explain its own role in the October 1987crash and the boom that preceded it.   In the nine months before the crash, Mexico's exchange was thefastest gainer among world markets. Its 52-stock index rose by morethan 690 percent.   Inexperienced investors weary of a protracted economic crisis,their savings devastated by inflation and currency devaluations,flocked in droves to eager brokers.   The boom was fed by a 1987 government order forcing brokeragehouses to open accounts for anyone willing to invest, regardless offinancial considerations. Houses hired many rookies to meet demand,swelling their work force to about 13,000.   In one display of volatility just before the crash, the marketsurged 7 percent in just 90 minutes after the announcement thatSalinas would be the governing party's presidential candidate in the1988 election.   The October 1987 crash hit investors, brokers and the businesscommunity especially hard.   The market index dropped 74 percent in 28 trading days, thesteepest decline anywhere. Losses reached an estimated $17 billion,said Oscar Espinoza Villareal, president of the National SecuritiesCommission.   The ``crack,'' as it's known here, prompted the securitiescommission in December 1987 to suspend 105 brokers trading withoutfederal licenses; fine 87 firms that violated trading rules, andraise capital requirements for all. The number of brokerageemployees is now down to about 10,000.   An announcement by Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe that no morebrokers faced sanctions soothed nerves and sent brokers back toconcentrating on business. In fact, the market index registered nosignificant changes in trading last week.   What remains unclear is whether the long-term effect theanticorruption campaign will help further Salinas' economic reforms.   To make up for a reduced governmental role in the economy andpromote growth, Salinas' 1989 budget projects a 7 percent increasein private investment.   ``One very basic thing that Mexico needs as never before is avery dynamic and secure stock market,'' del Rio said. ``As long asthere are doubts about the market, it will be difficult to getinvestment as quickly and in the amounts Salinas wants.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for AMs Tuesday Feb. 21.</NOTE></DOC>
