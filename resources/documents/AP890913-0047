William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency, said Tuesday he opposed changing the administration's cleanair bill to provide special help to the the nine states.   He produced figures strongly contradicting the states' assertionthat they would pay a disproportionate share of costs to reduce acidrain.   Reilly testified before the House Energy and Commerce energy andpower subcommittee on the acid rain section of the Bush legislation.Today, the Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee is meetingto amend the bill, a process that could take three weeks. Thelegislation would then go to the full Energy and Commerce Committee.   Reilly said the acid rain section is ``fair to those who cleanedupin the past. It doesn't make them pay to clean up again,'' hesaid, referring to electric customers from outside the nine states,whose utility bills already include the cost of pollution-cuttingmoves by utilities in their own areas.   The administrator sparred often Tuesday with Rep. Philip R.Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the energy and power panel, who insistedelectric customers in the nine states ``are being asked to do morethan our fair share.''   The states are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Georgia, Ohio,Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri.   Sharp has demanded that electric ratepayers in those statesreceive financial help in paying for power plant reductions ofsulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, emissions that form the compoundknown as acid rain. The nine states have plants that burn highsulfur coal.   So-called cost sharing could be accomplished by forcingnon-utility industries to reduce their emissions, or by havingelectric ratepayers elsewhere pick up part of the tab through theirbills.   ``The environment will not know'' where reductions come from,``but our ratepayers will know,'' Sharp said, contending that someutility rates could rise by 20 percent in the nine states. ButReilly said the five hardest-hit states would only see ratepayersbills increase _ on the average _ a third of a cent perkillowatt-hour by the year 2001.   Sharp began his hearing Tuesday by citing new figures thatcontended the nine states would be asked to clean up about 77percent of the acid rain emissions, even though they cause only 50percent of the problem.   He contended in the initial phase of the program, ratepayers inthe nine states would ``pay for fully 90 percent of the cleanup.''   But Reilly then presented his own statistics, which said that thenine states produced 51 percent of the acid rain emissions but theiractual cleanup costs would only be 50 percent of the total.   ``That's as fair as we can possibly make it,'' he said.   Bush's legislation seeks to reduce pollution from toxic airbornechemicals, acid rain and ozone. Acid rain consists of sulfur dioxideand nitrogen oxide, substances that unite in the air and travelhundreds of miles before falling to earth.   Acid rain destroys lakes, kills trees, makes buildingsdeteriorate and causes lung problems.   The president proposed reducing sulfur dioxide by 10 million tonsby the year 2000 based on 1980 levels _ nine million coming frompower plants and one million from industrial emissions alreadyachieved. There would be an emissions ``cap'' to prevent futurereleases from offsetting the reductions.   Nitrogen oxides from utilities would be cut two million tons fromthe projected level in the year 2000. But since these oxides couldincrease by three million tons during this period, there couldactually be an increase of one million tons.   Utilities could decide how to reduce their pollution, withpossibilities including switching to cleaner burning fuels,employing existing anti-pollution equipment like scrubbers, tryingnew methods such as developing technology for cleaner burning ofhigh-sulfur coal, and conservation.
