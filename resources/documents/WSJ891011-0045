Telos provides computer software design, development and consulting services for U.S. defense and space programs and some commercial applications.    Atlanta-based Contel is hoping the proposed acquisition will give the company a competitive edge in serving government customers and expanding its federal systems business, which provides government agencies with life-cycle management of integrated telecommunications and information systems networks.    Charles Wohlstetter, Contel's chairman, said Telos would help &quot;particularly in the design and development of Ada software, which is becoming the standard computer language among government agencies.&quot;    For the year ended March 31, Telos, based in Santa Monica, Calif., posted profit of $3.9 million on sales of $116 million.    Telos's chairman, president and cofounder, Lin Conger, described Contel as an &quot;excellent merger partner.&quot; Mr. Conger said he expects the transaction to be completed by year end. </TEXT></DOC>
