CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America's mainline faiths, mostly missing fromtelevision's sweeping purview in recent years, are launching a new,unprecedented ecumenical network on the nation's cable TV systems.   Plans for it were confirmed in interviews this week, with apartial start-up expected in midsummer, expanding to 18 to 20 hoursdaily in the fall.   ``A fresh, new wind is coming across the country's televisionscreens,'' said the Rev. Daniel Paul Matthews, a ManhattanEpiscopalian and board chairman of Vision Interfaith SatelliteNetwork.   Called ``VISN,'' it will shun soliciting money, as typifiesindividual TV religious preachers. But it has financial backing ofthe industry, and projects sustaining commercial sponsorship.   ``It's an idea whose time has come in market need and consumerneed,'' said David Ochoa of Nashville, Tenn., a United Methodistand president and chief executive officer of the enterprise.   ``For years, the mainline denominations have been on thesidelines, but they've finally got off their duffs and are doingsomething.''   Ochoa, who owns a cable channel in Los Angeles and who also iscommunications chief for United Methodism's board of highereducation and ministry, added:   ``It's the first time mainline faith groups, Protestant, RomanCatholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish, have worked together tocreate a new TV programming service for people of faithnationwide.''   Religious television in recent times has been dominated byindividuals, such as the fallen TV personalities Jim Bakker andJimmy Swaggart, giving a limited impression of religion.   ``We've been getting personal pietism exclusively slanted towarda narrow perspective,'' Matthews said. ``This is a valid piece ofthe pie, but it gave a distorted image of American religious life.''   Matthews, with extensive TV experience in Knoxville, Tenn., andAtlanta, before becoming rector of Manhattan's Trinity Church, saidthe new network would reflect historic faiths that have been the``backbone of America.''   Actively involved are most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodoxdenominations, plus some evangelical and Jewish bodies. Officialssaid Roman Catholics are expected to join through decisions ofbishops late this month.   Officials emphasized that added participation of evangelicalgroups was sought, including Southern Baptists, who already operatetheir own cable network.   Several factors largely have pushed mainline faiths off networktelevision, including aversion to soliciting money, plusderegulation of broadcasting, which made public service timeunnecessary and mostly unavailable.   This combination spurred individual preaching entrepreneurs totake over the field, fervently appealing for donations, raisinghuge amounts to buy their TV time.   A catalyst for the new network was one of the largest cablesystems in the country, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), based inDenver. It dropped Baker's scandal-linked network, and sought amore broadly based religious component.   A key influence was research showing less than 10 percent ofAmericans watched the individual preaching shows, leaving a largesegment of religious people concerned with broader faithcommitments.   TCI executives, along with those of about 20 other cablesystems, met last year with a recently organized NationalInterfaith Cable Coalition, and plans for the new network took lifeand have snowballed since.   Officials said the cable industry is providing ``bridgefinancing'' loans to get the network started, with TCI leading theway, in costs for facilities, staffing and satellite rentalexpected to be up to $5 million.   Programming is to come from the denominations, which alreadyhave many highly rated productions available but so far with littleoutlet for them.   ``Some of the most exciting, extraordinarily good televisionprogramming simply hasn't had broad distribution, although it hasevery bit of innovative broadcast quality,'' said William Airy,operations consultant for the new network.   ``From a programmers viewpoint, it's like being turned loose ina candy store, with all the fine resources existing there, butwhich nobody even knows about.'' Airy, of Albuquerque, N. Mex,formerly ran an all-music Gospel channel.   Plans are for prime-time programs to be of a broad value-basednature that will attract commercial advertising revenue.   Nelson Price of New York, head of United Methodistcommunications, and board member for the new network, said 12 to 15cable companies, besides TCI, were moving to help underwrite startof the venture.   He said programs would include examinations of social issues,dramas and entertainment faithful to moral-ethical precepts,interfaith films and programs for special audiences such aschildren, the elderly and single parents.   A standards and practicers committee has set these rules forcontent:   No material that denigrates or maligns any other faith orreligion; no programs that proseletyze to gain members at expenseof other churches, and no use of time to solicit funds.   Price said, ``VISN is a historic undertaking that bringstogether a diverse group of religious traditions to create andsustain a positive approach to religious programming.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs March 11.</NOTE></DOC>
