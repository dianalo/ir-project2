(Qandamp;A )andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT LOTUS PRODUCTSandM;1-2-3/SYMPHONYandM;CALCULATING EMPLOYEEandM;SALARY INCREASESandM;Q.andP;  I use Symphony Release 2.0 to calculate increases in employees' salaries.andO;Many of the salaries have ceilings, but for historical reasons someemployees' salaries are above their ceiling limits.andP;  These employees receiveno increases.andM;Given the following worksheet, what formula should I enter in column E? S. s.andO;Mullin University of New Brunswick Fredericton, CanadaandM;A.andP;  Enter the following formula in cell E2.andP;  Copy it down the column asneeded: @IF(C2-B2andgt;=D2,D2,(C2-B2andgt;= 0)*(C2-B2))andM;Enter the formula +E2+B2 in cell F2 and copy it to range F3..F4.andP;  Theseformulas work in all releases of 1-2-3 and Symphony.andM;TRANSLATING dBASE TOandM;1-2-3 OR SYMPHONYandM;Q.andP;  I've been using dBase III Version 1.1 and have a great deal ofinformation stored in that file format.andP;  I read that I can use this data in1-2-3 Release 2.andP;  Could you tell me how? E. F. Brewton Fulghum IndustriesInc. Wadley, Ga.andM;A.andP;  You need to use 1-2-3's Translate utility to convert dBase III files intoa worksheet file format.andP;  In DOS, make the 1-2-3 program directory current.andO;Then enter lotus.andP;  When the Access menu appears, select Translate.andP;  As analternative, you can enter trans at the DOS prompt in the 1-2-3 subdirectory.andM;Follow the prompts and elect to translate from dBase III to 1-2-3 Release 2.andO;First you see a screen of information about the translate procedure, then theTranslate utility prompts you to indicate a source file.andP;  Press the Escapekey if you need to edit the path of the source file.andP;  Select the name of thefile you wish to translate, then specify a name for the file after it hasbeen translated.andP;  Again, you can press the Escape key if you need to edit thepath or file name.andP;  The Translate utility converts the dBase III file intothe 1-2-3 Release 2 file format.andP;  When you exit from the Translate utility,you'll be able to retrieve the new file in 1-2-3.andP;  1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 andSymphony Release 1.2/2.0 can translate to and from dBase III.andM;ANNOYING NUM INDICATORandM;Q.andP;  I have Compaq Deskpro 286 computer and 1-2-3 Release 2.01.andP;  When I startthe computer and load 1-2-3, the NumberLock key is active.andP;  I've triedwriting a macro and storing it in a file named AUTO123, but this doesn't shutoff the Num indicator.andP;  Can I disable this annoying feature, or must I alwayspress the NumberLock key after I start up? Nancy J. Aldridge-Bloom DeloitteHaskins andamp; Sells Chicago, Ill.andM;A.andP;  Some 286-based computers do it, some don't.andP;  It's not a feature of 1-2-3or Symphony, and there is as yet no feature built into these spreadsheetproducts that lets you defeat it.andM;We don't have an immediate solution to the problem, but by now someone hassolved it.andP;  There must be software in the public domain that shuts off theNumberLock key after the computer starts.andP;  Please drop us a line if you knowa simple solution to the problem.andM;STATISTICAL BAGGAGEandM;Q.andP;  Is there a way to enter text that @functions do not recognize as zero?andO;When I use a statistical function such as @AVG in a range that containslabels, the function interprets the label as having a value of zero and usesit in the @AVG formula.andP;  The Function ignores blank cells, which is the way Iwant the formula to handle labels.andP;  However, rather than leave cells blank,I'd like to enter N/A to indicate to other users that some data is missing orisn't relevant.andP;  Nancy Motz EGandamp;G Miamisburg, OhioandM;A.andP;  There are two less-than-ideal ways to do this.andM;If your data is scattered throughout a range that includes several columns,you must customize your @Functions for each range.andP;  For example, suppose thatyou wish to calculate in cell A1 the average of the numbers in rage B3..D5 ofthe following Figure:andM;Move the cell pointer to cell A1 and enter @AVG(B3,B5,C3..C5,D4..D5).andP;  Thisformula omits from its list of arguments any cells that lack values.andM;If all the values you wish to average are within a single column, you can usethe @DAVG function.andP;  The @DAVG function calculates the average of valuesselected from a database.andP;  The function has the syntax@DAVG(input,offset,crit), in which input is a Database range with fieldnames, offset identifies the database column that contains the values toaverage, and crit identifies a range that determines which entries from thedatabase column should be included in the average.andM;The following figure shows the values from the previous figure, entered incolumn B.andP;  We've also added a field name in cell B2 and field name for aCriterion range in cell C2.andP;  These two field names are identical labels.andM;To put the Database and Criterion ranges to work, enter the formula@DAVG(B2..B11,0,C2..C3) in cell A1.andP;  To average only the numbers, move thecell pointer to cell C3 and enter the formula @ISNUMBER(B3).andM;The @ISNUMBER function isn't available in 1-2-3 Release 1A.andP;  For moreinformation on databases and the @D functions, see you 1-2-3/Symphonysoftware documentation.andM;TRANSLATING DIF FILESandM;Q.andP;  My repeated efforts to translate a DIF file into a 1-2-3 Release 2.01file yielded the error message The input file is not a valid DIF file.andP;  As alast attempt, I dusted off a copy of 1-2-3 Release 1A and used its Translateutility.andP;  It worked!andP;  Did I use the 1-2-3 Release 2.01 Translate utilityincorrectly? James I. Hamilton Kemper Group New York, N.Y.andM;A.andP;  If you attempt to translate a DIF file that contains the optional itemslabels and sizes, you will receive the error message The input file is not avalid DIF file.andP;  The Translate utility in 1-2-3 Release 2.01 and SymphonyReleases 1.2 and 2.0 can't interpret the optional items.andP;  Therefore, thetranslation fails.andP;  The Translate utility in Symphony Release 1.1 will readonly the first 12 lines of a file that contains these optional items.andO;However, the file can be translated successfully using the Translate utilityin 1-2-3 Release 1A/2 or Symphony Release 1/1.01.andM;To resolve the situation, use an ASCII text editor such as DOS'S EDLIN, orissue the File Import Text (in Symphony, SERVICES File Import Text) commandand delete the lines containing the optional information.andP;  Then use theTranslate utility in 1-2-3 Release 2.01 or Symphony Releases 1.2 and 2.0, andyour file will translate successfully.andM;PROTECT FORMULAS FROMandM;BEING CHANGEDandM;Q.andP;  Please tell me how I can design a worksheet in which the formulas areguarded against undesirable changes.andP;  I'd like to set up a worksheet and giveit to other people for data entry without any risk that they will damage theoriginal formulas.andP;  James Pekar Anchorage, AlaskaandM;A.andP;  There is no way to completely protect a worksheet against a sophisticateduser who wants to snoop.andP;  However, you might find that cell protectionsatisfies your needs.andM;Think of cell protection as an electric fence.andP;  When you start 1-2-3 orSymphony, cell protection is turned off until you invoke it.andP;  When you enableprotection, you turn on the electricity for the fence, after which you cannotmake changes to the protected cells.andM;Activate cell protection in 1-2-3 by selecting/Worksheet Global ProtectionEnable.andP;  In Symphony select SERVICES Settings Global-Protection Yes, thenselect Quit.andP;  In either case, you'll be able to make entries only inunprotected cells.andP;  Those entries will appear highlighted by either color orintensity, depending on your monitor, to distinguish them from entries inprotected cells.andM;To remove protection from cells in 1-2-3, select/Range Unprotect and indicatethe cell or range intended for data entry.andP;  In a Symphony SHEET window,select MENU Range Protect Allow-Changes.andP;  Repeat the procedure for each ofthe appropriate cells or ranges.andM;If this level of protection isn't enough, consider buying one of thecommercially available spreadsheet compilers.andP;  Once you've created aspreadsheet, compile it and &quot;lock in&quot; the worksheet so that users won't evenneed 1-2-3 to run it.andP;  They'll have very limited access to the worksheet, soyour formulas will remain safe.andM;1-2-3andM;ADD-IN MANAGER MAKESandM;FILE SIZE LARGERandM;Q.andP;  With the 1-2-3 Add-In Manager installed, any file I retrieve and saveincreases in size regardless of whether I make changes to the file.andP;  Why?andO;Maria Mendez Dallas, Tex.andM;A.andP;  When you save a file while the Add-In Manager is installed, 1-2-3 addsinformation to the file to identify which add-ins are attached at the moment.andM;DRIVER INITIALIZATIONandM;ERROR STARTING 1-2-3andM;Q.andP;  I installed 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 and tried to start the program byentering 123.andP;  I received the error message 1-2-3 cannot start because thedriver set is invalid.andP;  (Driver initialization error.) To make and revisedriver sets, see the &quot;Getting Started&quot; manual for instructions.andP;  (Press anykey to exit.)andP;  What can I do to get rid of this error message and start1-2-3? Rosemary Peters Des Moines, IowaandM;A.andP;  You receive this error message when your driver set contains the wrongdisplay driver.andP;  For example, you might have installed a driver for theEnhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), and your computer doesn't have an EGA card.andM;Rerun the Install program and select a graphics display driver appropriate toyour machine.andP;  If your computer lacks a graphics card, or if you don't knowwhat kind of graphics card it has, select First Time Installation from themain menu in the Install program.andP;  Answer No to the question Can yourcomputer display graphs?andP;  Then complete the selection of your text andgraphics printers as you did before and save the driver set.andP;  You'll mostlikely be able to run 1-2-3, though it won't be able to display graphs.andM;When you find out which graphics card your computer has, you can rerun theInstall program and select the appropriate graphics display driver.andP;  Then1-2-3 will be able to display graphs.andM;You might receive the error message you describe because a 1-2-3 driver fileis damaged.andP;  If you're using a hard-disk system, test your 1-2-3 program diskby placing it in the A drive.andP;  At the DOS prompt, type A: and press Return.andO;Then enter 123.andP;  If the program loads without incident, the files are in goodshape.andP;  Rerun the Installed program and select an alternative display driver.andM;If you can't start 1-2-3 from its original program disk, consider callingLotus Development Corp.'s Replacement Department at 617-623-6572.andP;  It may betime to get a replacement disk.andM;VALUE OR LABELandM;Q.andP;  I use 1-2-3 Release 2.01.andP;  The first help screen reads The first key youpress determines your action and states that pressing the dollar-sign keysignals that you are about to enter a formula or a number.andP;  However, when Ipress the dollar-sign key, the indicator in the upper right of the screendisplays LABEL.andP;  Is there anything wrong? Song Su Los Angeles, Calif.andM;A.andP;  Somebody changed the currency default in your spreadsheet.andP;  To see this,select/Worksheet Global Default Other International Currency.andP;  The controlpanel will display Currency sign: $.andP;  Notice that the cursor is located twopositions away from the dollar sign.andP;  When this default was changed, a spacewas added to the currency default by pressing the Spacebar.andP;  That's why theindicator displays LABEL when you type a dollar sign.andM;To change the currency format to its original state, select /Worksheet GlobalDefault Other International Currency.andP;  Press the Backspace key once to deletethe space, press Return twice, then select Quit Update Quit.andP;  Now when youtype a dollar sign, the indicator will display VALUE, and your entry will berecognized as a value for calculations.andM;ZEROS SUPPRESSEDandM;Q.andP;  I have a 1-2-3 Release 2 worksheet in which the Balance column showszeros in every row unless I issue the Worksheet Global Zero Yes command.andO;However, when I issue this command, all the zeros in the worksheet vanish.andO;Can I show zero at the bottom line when the account is paid up, but eliminatethe other zeros in the balance column? Bill McKee James River Timber Corp.andO;Butler, Ala.andM;A.andP;  There are many ways to accomplish this.andP;  Here's one way.andM;The formula in cell A7 of the following illustration is @SUM(A2..A5)andM;When you select /Worksheet Global Zero Yes, all the zeros in column A vanish.andO;Cell A7 displays a zero, so replace its formula with the following:@IF(@SUM(A2..A5)=[PHI],@REPEAT(&quot;&quot;, @CELL(&quot;width&quot;,!A6)-2)andamp;&quot;[phi]&quot;,@SUM(A2..A5))andM;Unfortunately, the zero in cell A7 will be a label rather than a value.andP;  Itwon't be affected by cell formats, but it might be invalid in some formulas.andO;So use this technique sparingly.andP;  This formula also works in 1-2-3 Release2.01, but not in 1-2-3 Release 1A.andM;SYMPHONYandM;PESKY MAILING LABELSandM;Q.andP;  I created a database in which I store mailing labels.andP;  The databasecontains fields for Name, Address1, Address2, City, State, and Zip.andM;Sometimes one or the other of the Address fields is blank.andP;  When I print themailing labels, a zero appears where there isn't an entry.andP;  Why is this?andO;Christine Morales South Kearny, N.J.andM;A.andP;  This happens because there are four formulas in your Report range.andO;Symphony prints the results of all four formulas for each record selected,regardless of whether there are corresponding entries in the database.andM;There are several ways to eliminate the zeros from your address labels.andO;Better yet, you can write formulas that close up the address in the labelwhen information is missing.andP;  For example, when you leave the Address2 fieldblank in your database, Symphony prints the following: Christine Morales 88Seemore Drive 0 South Kearny, NJ 07032andM;Ideally, Symphony should print the address as: Christine Morales 88 SeemoreDrive South Kearny, NJ 07032andM;The techniques for printing tidy address labels are too involved to presentin this column.andP;  However, the Symphony Maccos column in the June 1986 issuediscusses mailing labels in depth.andP;  Back issues of LOTUS are availablethrough our circulation department: LOTUS, Single Copy Sales, P.O. Box 9123,Cambridge, MA 02139-9950.andM;Qandamp;A REVISITEDandM;SEPARATE DATA RECORDSandM;In the February issue, you suggested that W. H. Cox use the Data QueryExtract command to create two sections of a database for a printed report.andO;Cox requested an easy way to insert several blank lines between rows 5 and 6of the database shown in this figure:andM;I recommend a different approach from yours.andP;  Erase range A11..C18.andP;  Enterthe letter F in cell B9 of the worksheet and the value -- 1 in cell C9.andP;  Copyrange B9..C9 to range B10..B11.andP;  These represent the number of dividing rowsto insert between the F and M entries in the database.andM;Use the Range Format Hidden command to hide the entries in range B9..C11.andO;Then select /Data Sort Data-Range and indicate range A2..C11.andP;  SelectPrimary-Key, indicate cell B1, and enter A for ascending sort order.andP;  SelectSecondary-Key, indicate cell C1, and accept the default of D for descendingsort order.andP;  When you select Go, 1-2-3 will sort the apparently blank rowsinto the database, separating the F and M records.andM;One advantage to this technique is that you can use a single line separatorfor each group of data and enter a page-break character in column A of eachseparator.andP;  When you print the database, each group of records begins on anew page.andP;  Allen Jackson New York, N.Y.andM;PAGE BREAKS REVISITEDandM;In answering Julie Davis's query about generating page breaks in 1-2-3(January), you failed to clarify an important point: A page-break symbol inthe print borders is invalid.andP;  If you select /Print Printer options BordersColumns (in Symphony, SERVICES Print Settings Other Left-Labels), anypage-break symbols within the columns you indicate will cease to have aneffect in printing.andP;  Page-break symbols must fall in the leftmost column ofthe Print range, even when you use print borders.andP;  Edison Vizuete NorthDakota Dept.andP;  of Human Services Mandan, N. Dak.andM;COPYING DOWN A COLUMNandM;In the March issue, you suggested that Greg Mosely use the Move command tocopy ranges of cells downward in the worksheet.andP;  Your answer works if you'reworking with a column of values.andP;  I use another method when I work with acolumn of formulas.andM;In the following worksheet, to copy the formulas in range C1..C6 to rangeC2..C7, select /Copy (in Symphony, MENU Copy), indicate range C1..C6, thenindicate cell D1.andP;  This creates a second set of formulas in column D andpreserves the relative relationships between referenced cells in theformulas.andM;Now select /Copy again, indicate D1..D6 as the range to copy from, andindicate cell C2 as the range to copy to.andP;  Finally, erase the formulas incolumn D. William F. Sutton III Provident Mutual Philadelphia, Pa.andM;The editor comments: You may prefer the following method if your worksheet isvery large and cluttered.andP;  Select /File Xtract Formulas (in Symphony,SERVICES File Xtract Formulas) and enter a file name such as TEMP.andP;  Thenindicate range C1..C6 as the range to extract.andP;  Your software stores a copyof the range on disk.andM;Now move the cell pointer to cell C2, select /File Combine Copy Entire-File,and enter the name of the temporary file.andP;  In Symphony select SERVICES FileCombine Copy Entire-File Ignore Formulas and enter the name of the temporaryfile.andM;The advantage of this technique is that you don't create interim formulas inthe worksheet.andP;  In complex models, this reduces recalculation time andeliminates the need to find an unused area in which to copy formulas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
