Sixty-nine patientsreceiving six different combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, includingDDP were examined. Twenty-eight of these patients received DDP in combinationwith the radioprotective agent S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)-ethylphosporothioicacid (WR 2721). No risk factors were identified relating to personalhabits or past medical history of the patients. However, patients receivingDDP (40 mg/m2) on 5 consecutive days had a significantly higher incidenceof neuropathy. Patients receiving DDP in combination with WR 2721 hada significantly lower incidence of neuropathy, and the mean dose at onsetwas significantly higher than the mean dose at onset of neuropathy forall other groups. In addition, five of six patients who were availablefor long-term follow-up demonstrated nearly complete reversal of thesigns and symptoms of neuropathy.</TEXT></DOC>
