Jerusalem police made a house-to-house searches of two Arabneighborhoods for the second day in a row, looking for suspectedrioters, police spokesman Alex Lapidot said.   The sweep, involving 150 policemen, was one of the largest inJerusalem since the Palestinian uprising began last Dec. 8.   Nitham Abu Hawelah, 23, of the West Bank's Balata refugee camp,died Wednesday after being hit by nine bullets in a clash withtroops more than a week ago, officials at Jerusalem's MukassadHospital said.   The fatality brought to 281 the number of Palestinians killed inthe uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seizedfrom Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Six Israelisalso have died in the violence.   An army spokesman said the two soldiers were hit by a firebombas they drove through Tulkarem. Israel television reported that onetrooper suffered moderate to serious burns while the other waslightly injured.   The army put a curfew on Tulkarem and started to comb the area.   At least 14 people were arrested in Abu Tor and Silwan on thesouthern outskirts of Jerusalem, and a police crackdown whichstarted late Tuesday was to continue until Thursday, police andIsrael television said.   The detainees ``are suspected of participating in stone-throwingincidents and other disturbances,'' Lapidot said.   Among those arrested in Jerusalem was Ibrahim Hamde, a preacherat Al Aqsa mosque, one of the holiest shrines of Islam. Israelradio called him a radical religious leader and said he wassuspected of distributing underground leaflets.   Silwan and the Arab sector Abu Tor have been major trouble spotssince the Palestinian uprising began. Both are part of Arab eastJerusalem, which Israel annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.   Lapidot said police also were searching for tax evaders in thetwo neighborhoods. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprisinghave called on their followers to stop paying taxes to the Israeliauthorities.   About a dozen Arabs were hustled out of their homes in pajamasand handed court summonses for tax evasion, reporters at the scenesaid.   Troops shot and wounded nine Arabs, including an 11-year-old boyand three teen-agers, in clashes in the West Bank city of Nablus,Arab hospital officials said. One of the wounded, 16-year-old JihadDib, was shot in the head and listed in critical condition atMukassad Hospital.   The military command confirmed five casualties and said it wasinvestigating the other reports.   In Balata, news of Hawelah's death sparked a stone-throwing riotand the army clamped a curfew on the camp's 12,000 residents.   In the occupied Gaza Strip's Beach refugee camp, soldierswounded five Arabs, three of them teenagers, Arab hospitalofficials said.   They said an 18-year-old was hit in the eye by a plastic bullet.The army said it was checking the reports.   Israeli troops detained Naela Ayesh, 28, a Palestinian employeeof the U.S.-based Save the Children organization in Gaza City, armyofficials said. They gave no reason for the arrest.   In another development, army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomrondefended the use of plastic bullets at a closed-door meeting of theparliamentary Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, Israel radioand newspapers reported.   Shomron was quoted as saying the army was using the bullets tostop riots before they got out of hand and to prevent fatalities.   But the figures he presented seemed to contradict his claim.Shomron told the legislators that in the last three weeks, sincethe massive use of plastic bullets began, 11 Palestinians have beenkilled and 267 wounded, compared with the previous three weeks inwhich 10 Arabs were killed and 137 wounded.</TEXT></DOC>
