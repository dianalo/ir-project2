(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In psychology, cognitive dissonance is a state that occurs when a person'sattitudes or beliefs conflict with his actions or perceptions.andP;  In computing,cognitive dissonance is the experience of working on a Toshiba T3200SXC andsuddenly remembering that what's sitting in front of you is a portable.andM;Toshiba, long the industry leader in portable computing, has alwaysmaintained two basic classes of machines: AC-only powerhouses and lighter,less power-packed laptops and notebooks.andP;  Make no mistake: The T3200SXCbelongs to the former class.andM;Our overall reaction to this machine is extremely positive.andP;  The 20MHz SXprovides a reasonable dose of computing power.andP;  The built-in modem andincluded expansion slots lend it flexibility, as do the two serial ports,dual-function parallel interface, and external VGA and keyboard connectors.andO;What truly propels this machine into excellence is the active-matrix colorLCD display (see sidebar).andM;We were somewhat perplexed by Toshiba's decision to outfit this powerful andexpensive machine with an SX-level processor.andP;  Despite the price difference,a full-bore DX would seem to make more sense for a machine targeted at theportable-desktop market.andM;The T2300SXC was evaluated with three primary considerations in mind:performance/compatibility, usability, and quality of display.andM;Compatibility is not an issue with this model.andP;  All of the test programs ranflawlessly.andP;  Microsoft Windows 3.0andM;andlsqb;TABLE DATA OMMITTED]andM;seemed a bit sluggish, but that was most likely because of our test model'slimited 3Mb of RAM.andM;The 20MHz SXC did quite well on PC Magazine benchmark tests, and we wereespecially pleased with the relative speed of the VGA subsystem and theimpressive results turned in by the Connor hard disk.andM;We assessed usability by running the SXC in a variety of work environments,making it our main machine for the duration of the testing period.andP;  Theergonomics and aesthetics of the SXC are superior.andP;  The 84-key, &quot;function keyswithces and a full numeric keypad.andP;  Although the control key is out of placeat the left of the &quot;A&quot; key, we were delighted by both the response and sizeof the keyboard.andM;The unit itself is built out of molded grayish-black plastic, weighs 17pounds, and has a pull-out security loop which can be used to lock the SXC toyour desk.andP;  Power, HDD, FDD, and the usual cursor-control status lights arelocated just under your line of sight on the post connecting the LCD to thebody of the PC.andM;The model is too heavy for a lap--at least for a computer--but we found theunit's size amenable to computing on a breakfast tray in bed, on a desktop,and on a coffee table.andP;  Seventeen pounds isn't too heavy, on the other hand,to carry while traveling, or to use in several locations around the office.andM;However, you may have second thoughts about slinging the SXC over yourshoulder for an assault up Mount Everest.andM;The combination diagnostics/set-up program allows you to set up screenblanking, toggle between monochrome and color modes, and configure the serialports and internal modem.andP;  One of the most flexible options on the system isthe printer port.andP;  A slider switch on the case allows you to toggle between aprinter and floppy A: or B: drive configurations.andP;  An option in the setupprogram, only valid when the slider is set to printer, allows you to choosebetween &quot;output&quot; and fully bidirectional modes.andM;Actively &quot;Matrix'd&quot;andM;The key to this machine is the active-matrix LCD.andP;  The displays makes it anideal machine to use for on-the-road presentations, or as a primary machinefor those who find themselves traveling more often than they're at home.andP;  Asa primary machine, the SXC would be best for anyone who needs to compute inmore than one location, and who doesn't want to have to set up CRTs andkeyboards all over town or the office.andM;A big plus for those who want to use the SXC for presentations is the immenseviewing area.andP;  We were able to clearly see both text and graphics images fromwell over six feet away, and within a 180-degree arc around the screen.andM;The 10.5-inch horizontal active-matrix LCD supports VGA, CGA, EGA, and MCGA.andO;A choice in the setup menu allows you to toggle between color and monochromemodes.andP;  VGA is provided via a Western Digital Paradise controller chip.andM;While you can access the full 264,000-color VGA palette when using anexternal monitor, the LCD supports only 256 onscreen colors from a palette of185,913 in 320x200 mode, and 16 colors from a palette of 512 in 640x480 mode.andM;The screen image is phenomenal.andP;  Without question, this is the clearest andbrightest display we have ever seen.andP;  A nice feature is that you can displayinformation on both an external VGA-compatible monitor and the LCD screensimultaneously.andM;There is one major design flaw on the SXC, however: There are no brightnessor contrast controls.andP;  Toshiba claims that the screen is so well optimizedthat nobody will miss these controls.andP;  Not true.andP;  In rooms that are eithervery bright, or dim, you really need to be able to optimize the screen, otherthan by tilting it back and forth.andP;  We also noticed that the screen seemedbrighter near the top in rooms with very little light.andM;Under Windows, there was no evidence of the delayed or invisible cursoreffects that plague conventional LCDs, nor were there any trailing effectswhen rapidly scrolling either textual or graphical data.andM;Through a gamut of graphics applications--including Autodesk Animator, PCGlobe, PC USA, CorelDRAW!, ZSoft's Publisher's Paintbrush, WinWord, PageMaker4.0, and Excel--all images were acurately mapped.andP;  In practice, thebrightness and clarity of the display overcame the limited colors, even whendisplaying 256 color reproduction of photographic images.andM;Internally, the SXC is based around a surface-mount motherboard.andP;  Takingapart the whole machine is not advised as it involves dealing with 40 screwsand 20 minutes of work.andP;  Fortunately, accessing the expansion areas is fareasier.andP;  The internal modem port is located on the bottom of the case in ashielded compartment.andP;  To get at the expansion slots, you need to remove theplastic back piece and a metal cover.andP;  The SXC has an 8-bitthree-quarter-length slot, and one 16-bit full-length slot.andP;  A pull-downpanel on the left side allows you to get at any connectors mounted on acard's bracket.andP;  To get at the RAM and comprocessor areas you simply removethe keyboard and its metal underliner.andM;Additionally, there are two 9-pin serial connectors, one 25-pinparallel/floppy disk drive connector, one PS/2-style keyboard port, and one15-pin VGA adapter.andM;The 1.44Mb floppy drive is manufactured by Citizen, and the hard disk is a3.5-inch Conner model 3104.andM;The performance and quality of this machine were top flight.andP;  Not only did ithave an almost joyous feel to it, but it also ran through every applicationtossed its way without so much as blinking.andP;  The price is high, and that'sthe way it will be for some time to come with active-matrix LCDs.andM;Price aside, the Toshiba earns the highest marks for technical innovation andoverall excellence.andM;David A. Harvey is a freelance writer based in Houston.andP;  You can reach him onCompuServe at 72007,2313 and on BIX and MCI as daharvey.andM;Color My World: Thin Film TransistorsandM;One of the most important technological developments of the '90s, thin filmtransistor (TFT) LCDs, provide a display that far outstrips the capabilitiesof conventional CRTs, in terms of both performance and quality.andP;  In aninteresting convergence of the consumer and computer markets, TFT displaysare being used for both PC and HDTV (high-definition television) displays.andM;TFT displays differ from a strandard LCD in that each pixel on the grid iscontrolled by a transistor.andP;  In essence, a TFT flat-panel display is asingle, giant integrated circut with a fixed resolution.andP;  The panel on theT3200SXC consists of 921,600 transistors--that's 640 vertical, 480horizontal, and one each for red, green, and blue.andP;  To display modes lowerthan 640x480, pixels are combined together in picture elements (pels).andP;  Forexample, in 320x200 mode, each pel consists of four pixels.andM;While the future of TFTs is bright, especially when HDTV begins to drive themarket, TFTs today are extremely costly.andP;  The problem lies in themanufacturing process.andM;TFTs are difficult to produce.andP;  One defective pixel, and the entire panel hasto be scrapped.andP;  As a result, production yields are extremely low, and pricesare high.andM;According to Jefferey Friederichs, product marketing manager for Toshiba,&quot;Over the next one and a half years, we'll see refinements in themanufacturing process that will allow for increased yield.andP;  This is nothingrevolutionary, just an evolution of [the] manufacturing process.andP;  Forexample, two years ago, the technology didn't exist to manufacture even a10.5-inch active-matrix display.&quot;andM;Recently, Toshiba entered into a technology-sharing agreement with IBM Japan,which evolved into a joint venture, Display Technologies, Inc.andP;  One resulthas been the development and production of a 14-inch panel.andM;Friederichs sees TFT displays supplanting Toshiba's plasma screens within thenext six months to a year, and replacing CRTs within the next three or fouryears.andP;  Within the next year, he believes that Toshiba will be able toproduce a TFT-based laptop with a reasonable battery life, thanks in part toToshiba's work with nickel-hydride batteries.andM;TFT is inherently superior to CRT technology.andP;  Subjectively, we noticed thatafter spending time with the SXC, our CRT monitors seemed washed-out andblurry.andP;  The reason is that a transistor is capable of displaying informationwith far greater precision and speed than a phosphor.andP;  The bonus to all thisis that TFTs produce virtually no electromagnetic fields, eliminating worriesabout the hazardous effects of VDTs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
