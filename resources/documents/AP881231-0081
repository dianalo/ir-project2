(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan on Saturdayauthorized an exchange of diplomatic notes to put the U.S.-Canadianfree trade agreement into effect and called it ``an example for theworld on how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples.''   The president telephoned Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroneyfrom the estate of publisher Walter Annenberg, where he isvacationing, to congratulate him on the final approval of the pactFriday by Canada's Senate.   Reagan also took action under the law, through an executiveorder, to permit the export to Canada of up to 50,000 barrels perday of crude oil. The order affects oil that has been transported bypipeline and oil from the naval petroleum reserves.   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said theexchange of diplomatic notes would put the agreement into effect asof Sunday.   ``The Free Trade Agreement established the world's largest freetrade zone involving two countries,'' Popadiuk said.   The United States and Canada are each other's principal tradingpartners, with two-way trade of nearly $150 billion in 1988.   The agreement eliminates all tariffs between the two countriesover a 10-year period and eliminates or reduces many non-tariffbarriers.   ``The agreement will also enhance energy security, improve theinvestment climate, and significantly increase opportunities in theservices sector, including financial services,'' Popadiuk said.   ``While the free trade agreement will not eliminate all tradeissues between our two countries, it gives us the framework tomanage them and the basis for expanding our economic relations,''the White House spokesman said.   Popadiuk quoted Reagan as saying, in his telephone call toMulroney, ``Together, our governments have set an example for theworld on how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples.''</TEXT></DOC>
