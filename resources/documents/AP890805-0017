Friday's speech in Farsi was broadcast by Tehran radio andtranslated by The Associated Press in Cyprus:</TEXT><TEXT>   One of the most vociferous, revealing and at the same time veryugly events this week took place in Lebanon. This can reveal theface of the hegemonistic powers of the world.   See how ugly the issue is.   A country by the name of Israel, which is from the root up anusurper, officially enters a town with military forces, with ahelicopter, and takes the Friday prayer leader of the town alongwith two of his security men.   This is not at all acceptable by any international standard, andno country can say this is right. No international law can condonethis action.   A country cannot enter another country, kidnap and leave ... andthen confess to it.   OK, it used to do this and not confess, it would deny it.   This wasn't boastfulness. It was a crime, but not boasting.   But it confessed. It announced. This is to make a laughingstockof all those individuals who adhere by international laws.   What happened in return?   Some innocent people, whose identity isn't even known. A numberof unknown people combating covertly, announced that a person theyhad (been keeping) as a spy had been killed. They hanged him inrevenge. Their reason was that Israel is America's agent, and wewill take our revenge on this American person whom we have captive,and who is implicated in Israel's crime, in return for Mr. SheikAbdul Karim Obeid. This was what they said.   Then they threatened that they would kill the rest (of thehostages) too, if you don't free Obeid. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   So what should we do in this situation?   Here there is one clear point and a somber point:   The clear point is that a government has officially confessed,confessed to all about its crime.   The somber point is that a group has killed someone, who may beinnocent, but we don't know, therefore we will not make anyjudgment on this. We don't even know who he is, and so we don'tmake any judgment.   And we don't know this group either, whether they are righteouspeople or not, who they are. We only know only that the people ofLebanon are innocent people. And innocent people cannot becondemned without reason. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   Global arrogance (The United States), if it wanted to dosomething, it would have been clear:   It should take Israel by the collar and say free Sheik Obeid sothat the issue is finished.   If you take a criminal and ask him to stop his crimes, this ispopular in the world.   They might say, ``No, this doesn't concern us and we are nomatch for Israel.'' This is not acceptable to us. No one acceptsthis. Israel itself does not accept this, the people of Americadon't accept this. If America really wants to stop Israel it mustannounce, it must say, ``Until Sheik Obeid is freed American aidwill be stopped.''   This Congress that convenes in America, these bigwigs that sitand vote there, this is the way you should vote.   Why do you think so crookedly, and speak so arrogantly? Insteadof going after a self-confessed, known, boastful criminal, youorder that your warships gather from around the world towardinnocent Lebanon. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   What kind of idiots are you?   See how ugly the world is? See how the idiotic are thepoliticians who rule the world?   If they want to solve the problems of Lebanon there are ways,the ways are clear; they don't want to solve the problems, they arenot prepared to stop backing Maronite rule in Lebanon.   They are still hoping, waiting for the day to have a MaroniteIsrael in Lebanon. One Jewish Israel in Palestine, one MaroniteIsrael in Lebanon. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   I state, I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon hassolutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable,prudent solutions.   These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solvethe problems. Come let us enter reasonably, we too will help solvethe problems there, so the people of the region can live in peaceand harmony.</TEXT></DOC>
