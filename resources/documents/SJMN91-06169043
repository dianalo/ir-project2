Federalagencies would be required to make efforts to protect it, probably by banninglogging in areas where the bird is known to nest and breed.;    Similarprotections for the spotted owl have resulted in dramatic logging cutbacks inthe Northwest. Some industry leaders predict the reductions ultimately couldcost the region as many as 100,000 jobs.;    However, environmentalistsmaintain the industry's job force is declining because of market pressures andmodernization of equipment.;    Earlier this year, the Fish and WildlifeService proposed more than 11 million acres be designated as habitat criticalto the spotted owl. The service said today that &quot;critical habitat for themarbled murrelet is not determinable at this time.&quot;;    Like the remainingestimated 3,000 pairs of spotted owls, the marbled murrelet lives in treesfound primarily in old-growth forests.;    Fish and Wildlife estimates thereare fewer than 2,000 of the seabirds in California, fewer than 2,000 inOregon, about 5,000 in Washington, between 20,000 and 45,000 in BritishColumbia and between 50,000 and 250,000 in Alaska.;    Numerous other speciesliving in old-growth forests are candidates for listing as threatened orendangered species. Adoption of effective conservation strategies for speciesdependent on old-growth could benefit species other than the marbled murrelet,Turner said.;    &quot;I believe it is essential that we strive to developconservation strategies that protect species before the need for listingoccurs,&quot; Turner said in a prepared statement today.;    &quot;This is the only waythat we can make the most of our chances to preserve our precious wildlifeheritage without encountering the frictions that sometimes arise in theEndangered Species Act process.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910617  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  527  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday June 17, 199100169043,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
