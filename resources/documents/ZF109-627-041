From its sibling product, Word for Windows,come the ribbon for recording and changing character formatting and afunctional ruler for setting margins and tabs.andP;  The menu bar and commandstructure also closely mimic the menus in Word for Windows, enabling users toquickly upgrade from one to another.andM;The changes in command structure range from merely annoying -- the commandmenu is now invoked with ALT instead of ESC -- to dangerous.andP;  The DEL keydeletes marked text permanently instead of cutting it to a paste buffer.andO;Fortunately, there is a single-level undo capability for recovering fromminor disasters, provided they are noticed immediately.andM;File compatibility with version 5.0 is excellent.andP;  In processing severaldozen existing 5.0 files and newly created 5.5 files -- documents, stylesheets, glossaries, supplemental dictionaries and printer drivers -- underboth versions, PC Week Labs found no incompatibilities in either direction.andM;However, because keyboard macros are related to the menu structure, 5.0macros must be converted to a 5.5-compatible format.andP;  A conversion program isincluded, along with documentation on fine-tuning the conversion by hand.andM;As for performance, there are virtually no changes.andP;  Long-running processeslike repaginating or searching through a long document are measurably slower(by up to 50 percent) than in version 5.0, but interactive operations are notperceptibly affected, according to PC Week Labs' benchmarks.andM;Realizing that users get attached to a word processor's look and feel,Microsoft has bundled version 5.0's tried-and-true interface in the same box,but without documentation or tutorials.andP;  Manuals for the old interface costan extra $25.andM;Word 5.0 users can upgrade for $50, but the only reason to upgrade would beto tap the new interface.andP;  Functionally, Word 5.0 and 5.5 are identical.andP;  Assuch, Word 5.5 is best suited for corporations who have standardized on Wordand want a version that is easier to use.andM;Word 5.5 costs $450.andP;  Networks require one copy of the program for eachserver plus a $295 license pack (containing documentation but no software)for each workstation.andP;  Upgrades from earlier versions cost $75.andM;Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., can be reached at (800) 426-9400.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
