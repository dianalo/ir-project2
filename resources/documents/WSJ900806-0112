The Englishrefugees who first settled these shores came here in largepart because the medieval mind-set of Tudor England was beingreplaced by James I's modernizing ideas, and those whocouldn't adapt emigrated.   The essence of medieval polity was that all authority wasultimately vested in &quot;natural law,&quot; i.e. God's law, which wasinterpreted for the people's use by the church. While thedrafters of our Constitution were far removed from medievaltimes ecclesiastically, their political instincts were stillrooted in Tudor England, not Stuart, Orange or Hanoverian.</LP><TEXT>   Compare Britain and the U.S. in terms of the locus of&quot;sovereignty.&quot; In the former, the law is whatever the Houseof Commons says it is, and that House is by and large a fairreflection of the &quot;vox populi&quot;. &quot;The people&quot; are, through therepresentational mechanism of the House of Commons, indeedsovereign.   In the U.S., by contrast, sovereignty is vested in a pieceof paper, the meaning of which, while reasonably clear whenwritten, is now available to the people only through theinterpretation of the Supreme Court. Our electedrepresentatives, both executive and legislative, are helplessin the face of contrary &quot;interpretations&quot; by a majority ofour nine high priests.   You and I may understand, for example, that so long as theU.S. does not have an &quot;official&quot; church, the Constitution'sprohibition of the &quot;establishment&quot; of religion is beingcomplied with, and no further action or decision isnecessary. However, the simple words in the Constitution nolonger mean what they say; they mean whatever our unelectedlifetime-appointed neoclergy decides they mean.   Therefore, unless there is a fundamental restructuring ofthe American system of government, the Constitution willremain, rather than be transformed into, &quot;Holy Writ.&quot; I leaveit to you and your readers to figure out what can be doneabout it.
