SHEERAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After a month of public feuding, the family ofbrain-damaged singer-composer Barry Sadler of ``Ballad of GreenBerets'' fame has agreed to the appointment of an independentguardian to handle his affairs.   The agreement was announced Tuesday by Probate Judge John J.Donnelly following two days of hearings on Sadler's mentalcompetence.   While the judge agreed Sadler was incompetent to handle hisaffairs, he said he had no jurisdiction to rule in the case becauseSadler is not an Ohio resident.   At the same time, Sadler's family has agreed to let a probatejudge in Nashville, Tenn., name an independent guardian, Donnellysaid.   Sadler's mother, Bebe, and son, Thor, 24, had made competingappeals to be named his guardian.   Under the agreement, the guardian must consult with familymembers before making major decisions for Sadler, according toDonnelly, who said relatives indicated a preference for naming asguardian a Vietnam veteran like Sadler.   Sadler, a former member of the Army's Special Forces unit, wroteand performed ``The Ballad of the Green Berets'' in 1965 in honor ofthe unit. He since has written a series of books on military themes.   He was interviewed by Donnelly at Southwest General Hospital insuburban Middleburg Heights on Monday. ``The responses wereconfusing,'' said Donnelly.   The 48-year-old Sadler, who has a home in suburban Nashville,repeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told thecorrect date, and could name only two of his three children, thejudge said.   Sadler was shot in the head last year in Guatemala City, where hehad lived for five years. The circumstances of the shooting havenever been disclosed.   Psychologist Gintautas Z. Sabataitis testified that Sadler wascompetent but ``severely limited'' in his abilities and needed aguardian.   Sadler had been treated at the Nashville Veterans Administrationhospital before being sent to Cleveland Nov. 8 for further treatmentand rehabilitation.</TEXT></DOC>
