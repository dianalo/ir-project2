David Durenberger was on the car telephone telling his son that the last stop before dinner was to do a campaign spot at radio station WCCO.    &quot;Negative or positive?&quot; asked David Jr.    It was a perfectly relevant question in the Senate race between Mr. Durenberger and state Attorney General Hubert &quot;Skip&quot; Humphrey III. In this campaign, issues have played second fiddle to a bitter battle of advertisements filled with allegations and misrepresentations.    &quot;It's been pretty negative, very negative. I want to know what they're going to do for me,&quot; complains Roger Autrey, 52 years old, the proprietor of a St. Paul convenience shop.    The public irritation got so bad that last week the two candidates agreed to stop running negative ads. But whether the cease-fire will hold remains to be seen.    On paper, this race should have been one of the more high-toned in this negative political year. Minnesota has a tradition of substantive politics that has produced acclaimed politicians in both parties.    And GOP Sen. Durenberger is a thoughtful, 10-year Senate veteran who has been a major participant in issues ranging from health care to intelligence matters. Democrat Hubert Humphrey III, of course, is the son and namesake of the most successful and respected politician in Minnesota's history, the late senator and vice president.    But issues in their campaign have been overshadowed by an electronic duel of negative 30-second television spots and radio ads. And while the candidates lament the dominance that the ads have commanded in the campaign, they haven't any regrets about their own volleys.    One Humphrey ad suggested that Sen. Durenberger believes that &quot;pulling the plug&quot; on sick old people is a valid way to save Medicare dollars.    &quot;I don't regret that, and very frankly our own polling has shown it has worked very well for us,&quot; Mr. Humphrey says.    Meanwhile, Durenberger ads have blamed Mr. Humphrey for a rise in crime, even though the attorney general in Minnesota, unlike at the federal level, isn't the chief law-enforcement officer. If that is misleading, then it is equally misleading for Mr. Humphrey to say he is tough on crime, argues Leon Oistad, Mr. Durenberger's campaign manager.    Charles Backstrom, a University of Minnesota political scientist, contends advertisements for both candidates so &quot;cheapen the process&quot; that both parties will have difficulty recruiting &quot;equally classy people {to run} in the future.&quot;    Why have the candidates been relying on such pointed electronic weapons? Because &quot;negative ads work.&quot; Mr. Backstrom says.    Ironically, earlier in the campaign both the senator and Mr. Humphrey had improved their images with positive commercials about themselves. Sen. Durenberger, according to Mr. Backstrom, rid himself of a &quot;flaky&quot; image: In the positive ads, &quot;He looks stable, a family man with values.&quot;    Mr. Humphrey used his earlier spots to &quot;change himself into a dynamic person,&quot; Mr. Backstrom says. &quot;He's not Hubert, but he's good as he can be.&quot;    Being the son of Hubert Humphrey has been &quot;a strength,&quot; the Democratic candidate says. But the strong paternal shadow makes for some backhanded compliments.    &quot;Time and again people will say, 'if you're only half as good as your father, I'm voting for you,'&quot; says Mr. Humphrey, a short, bouncy man who sounds like his father, but who isn't as eloquent or long-winded.    Mr. Humphrey, 46, calls himself a &quot;progressive liberal&quot; who believes the &quot;government can be an active partner and a constructive force for change.&quot; He blasts President Reagan's strategic defense initiative, favors gun control and says, unlike Sen. Durenberger, that he would have supported a recently approved federal antidrug bill, despite his opposition to a provision permitting the death penalty for those convicted of drug-related killings.    Despite his liberal views, Mr. Humphrey gets hit from the Democratic left because he opposes abortion. And he fails to generate great excitement within the Democratic Farmer Labor Party, as the Democrats are called here. &quot;I just have a real hard time knowing what Skip Humphrey stands for,&quot; says Rita Brain, 37, a state computer specialist who has been active in party campaigns.    Sen. Durenberger, tall and low-key, sometimes raises eyebrows with his candid style. In an interview, the GOP senator says in a reference to the Iran-Contra scandal that &quot;the president was a participant in the lie.&quot; Mr. Durenberger was rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee a couple of years ago for talking too freely about an Israeli spy case in the U.S. when he was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater said in a recent book that Sen. Durenberger had a reputation as a &quot;blabbermouth.&quot;    The senator's ads portray him as &quot;Senator Health Care&quot; because of the active role he has taken with Medicare legislation. He recently brought in Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to Minnesota for a series of health-issue forums, but has been criticized for taking campaign money from tobacco companies. Sen. Durenberger, 54, supports providing research funds for the Strategic Defense Initiative and advocates tuition tax credits and school vouchers.    Currently, Sen. Durenberger leads in two important sets of campaign numbers. Polls indicate that he is ahead in the election race. And he anticipates raising a total of $6.5 million in campaign funds, while the Humphrey camp expects to raise about $2.5 million.    For now, both candidates have agreed to run only commercials that focus on pure self-promotion. Mr. Humphrey also has suggested that the two men appear jointly at a series of forums around the state.    &quot;That would be good,&quot; says Mr. Autrey, the St. Paul shopkeeper, because voters might &quot;not get the same old rhetoric over and over again.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;In Wisconsin, Candidates for U.S. Senate Engage in Race Out of Keeping With State Traditions...&quot; -- WSJ Oct. 31, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
