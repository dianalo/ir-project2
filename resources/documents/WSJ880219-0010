One reason, no doubt, is that Congress has been chastened by the public outrage over the pork-filled continuing resolution it dumped on the President just before Christmas. If the current mood prevails, this year's budget process may be less chaotic than last year's. The key unknown is what effect a national election will have.    Horrors continue to emerge from last year's fiasco. The latest -- a secret 20% pay increase for congressional staffers -- is described below. Such revelations have had their effect. Fifty House Democrats, representing different points on the party's political compass, have sent a letter to Speaker Jim Wright saying they will refuse to support another last-minute catchall spending bill. President Reagan has promised to veto any such document. So there may be little change in the current design for spending the $1.09 trillion of the nation's resources Washington has preempted for its particular and often-doubtful purposes.    That design gains further stability from the fact that most of its contours had been established in the budget summit agreement between the White House and Congress last November. Defense spending, for example, already has been set at $299.5 billion for fiscal 1989, some $33 billion less than the Defense Department's original request. Under pressure from the Democrats, national security has been gradually giving way to social spending. The so-called &quot;safety-net&quot; programs, which account for half again as much spending as defense, will have healthy budget increases.    In this election year, of course, there will be the usual sniping that this administration wants to &quot;shortchange&quot; the poor. But the programs most jealously guarded by Congress have nothing to do with the poor. The new budget calls for the abolition of the Interstate Commerce Commission, small-business loan programs, and urban development action grants. Well-heeled interests will fight to preserve these dinosaurs.    The poor would benefit from lower food prices if the administration's proposed cutbacks in crop-price supports are implemented, but those will be fought as well. Ditto with the budget's proposal to overhaul U.S. sugar quotas, a protectionist program that costs a typical family of four an extra $100 a year for such staples as ketchup, cereal and peanut butter.    The administration wants to add 135,000 units to the nation's stock of government-subsidized housing. To its credit it is proposing as well to end federal subsidies for the repair of rental housing in any cities with rent-control laws, thus recognizing how such laws have worked to destroy thousands of lower-income housing units. But don't bet on survival of that forward-looking idea.    Privatization of government services is showcased in the new budget. The administration wants to sell several regional power-marketing authorities, naval petroleum reserves, waste-treatment plants, mass-transit projects and the Rural Telephone Bank. Programs targeted for &quot;possible privatization&quot; include some Postal Service operations and the management of minimum-security prisons. And why not, when even heavily socialist countries around the world are privatizing apace, thereby shucking off huge budget costs?    Interestingly enough, some Democrats are warming to the idea. &quot;Privatization often is simply good management sense. It no longer represents just an ideological argument,&quot; says David Linowes, a Democrat who chairs President Reagan's Commission on Privatization, which issues its report next month. Adds Democratic Rep. Dennis Eckart of Ohio: &quot;We ought to look at alternatives and better ways to provide (Services). The basic Democratic response until now has been 'Drop dead' but I think that's a mistake.&quot; Some Democrats believe the president may get some of his privatization initiatives enacted before he leaves office.    Of course, there will be the usual election-year temptation to fork up more pork and this might convert the current relative order into renewed disorder. But Congress surely is aware of the public disgust over its budgetary performance last year. If Speaker Wright continues to ignore advice of the type he has just received from his 50 fellow Democrats, sometime, somehow there will be a political price to pay. </TEXT></DOC>
