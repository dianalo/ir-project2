Yukon Pacific is proposing to build and operate an intrastatenatural gas pipeline known as the Trans-Alaska Gas System (TAGS) to transportgas from the North Slope of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay to Valdez on Alaska'ssouthern coast where it would be liquefied and transported by ship to thosePacific Rim countries. Construction of the pipeline, LNG plant, and marineterminal would require five years. When the TAGS facilities are fully operational,14 million metric tons of LNG per year (660 billion cubic feet (Fcf) regasifiedor 730 trillion Btu's) could be exported. Authorization is requested for a term of 25 years commencing on the dateof the first delivery, which is estimated to be in 1996. The application is filed with the ERA pursuant to Section 3 of the NaturalGas Act (NGA) and DOE Delegation Order. No. 0204-111.

Specifically,Yukon Pacific proposes to export up to 14 million tons (660 Bcf) of naturalgas annually for a period of 25 years commencing on the date of the firstdelivery, which is estimated to be in 1996. Yukon Pacific states the TAGS project would include the construction ofa intrastate, 796.5-mile, 36-inch outside diameter, buried, and chillednatural gas pipeline, originating at Prudhoe Bay, Alalska, and terminatingat a tidewater site on Port Valdez, Anderson Bay, Alaska. The pipelinewould transport up to 2.3 Bcf of natural gas per day. In addition to thepipeline, the TAGS project would include (1) an LNG plant designed to removeany impurities from incoming gas, and to reduce the temperature of suchgas to -259 degrees Fahrenheit, thereby condensing it to a liquid statefor storage and shipping: (2) four LNG storage tanks, each with an individualcapacity of 800,000 barrels (bbls); (3) a marine terminal designed to berthand load two LNG tankers; and (4) 15 LNG ocean transport vessels havingindividual cargo capacities of a nominal 125,000 cubic meters. Yukon Pacificindicates natural gas production wells and gathering systems are alreadyin place to produce and gather the gas to be exported from the North Slopereservoirs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Interest Considerations</ITAG>In support of its application, Yukon Pacific states there is no presentor future domestic need for natural gas from the North Slope of Alaska.Yukon Pacific indicates there currently exists a substantial natural gassupply surplus in the United States that will continue into the next century.Yukon Pacific prepared and submitted a study that concludes that adequatesupplies exist in the Lower-48 states, Canada, and Mexico to meet economicallyU.S. demand for natural gas in the foreseeable future without the needfor the Alaskan gas proposed to be exported. This study also concludesthat Alaska's reserves are sufficient to support both the TAGS projectand the Alaskan Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS) project, a projectsponsored by a partnership of other private firms to deliver North Slopegas by means of a pipeline across Alaska and Canada to the Lower-48 statesthat received Presidential and Congressional approval in 1977. In addition,Yukon Pacific questions whether gas from Alaska should be considered apotential source to meet domestic need because it may not be economicallyfeasible to supply Alaskan natural gas to the Lower-48 states in the eventa domestic supply shortage emerged. With respect to need for the gas inAlaska, Yukon Pacific asserts that all of the State's requirements canbe satisfied by the available reserves in the Cook Inlet Basin area ofAlaska. Yukon Pacific maintains that the export of natural gas from the North Slopeof Alaska to the Pacific Rim countries would be consistent with the publicinterest. First, Yukon Pacific indicates that exports of natural gas fromAlaska would yield significant international relations and national securitybenefits, including; (1) Reduction in the U.S. trade balance deficit; (2)strengthening of our trade and political alliances with Pacific Rim countries;(3) promotion of international energy stability by decreasing relianceon politically unstable regimes; (4) reduction of the potential for relianceby our allies on the Soviet Union for natural gas; and (5) maintainanceof Canada as a supplier of natural gas to our domestic market.Yukon Pacific also indicates that the TAGS project will benefit the Stateof Alaska by assisting in the development of its natural resources, introducingnew industry into the State, providing new jobs, and creating an expandedtax base. Yukon Pacific states that the TAGS project will benefit the National economyby encouraging development and discovery of new energy sources and by providingbusiness opportunities associated with the construction and operation ofthe TAGS project.In addition, Yukon Pacific states that authorization of the TAGS projectwill inject an element of competition into the development of North Slopenatural gas reserves which should prove healthy to both United States andCanadian entities seeking to bring natural gas to their respective domesticmarkets.Finally, Yukon Pacific indicates that the TAGS project will not be detrimentalto the interest of American consumers because the risks and costs associatedwith the completion and operation of the TAGS project, including the marketingof the gas, will be borne by the project's private sponsors, their lendersand investors, and the foreign purchasers of the gas. <ITAG tagnum="84">Supply Sources</ITAG>Yukon Pacific indicates that it has entered into discussions with certainNorth Slope producers and the State of Alaska for the purchase and commitmentof sufficient natural gas reserves to supply the long-term export contemplatedby its application. Yukon Pacific states that it is assessing its optionsfor the purchase of proven and current production from Endicott, Kuparuk,Lisburne, Milne Point, Prudhoe Bay, and Thompson/Flaxman Island North Slopeproduction fields. These fields represent proven and producible reservesof approximately 36.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). Yukon Pacific anticipatesthat undefined or nonproducing fields in the North Slope will be developedand exploited by North Slope producers once the TAGS pipeline facilitieshave been constructed. These undefined or nonproducing fields include BeechyPoint, Coleville Delta, East Umiate, Gwyder Bay, Havard, Hemi-Springs,Kaktovik, Kavik, Niakuk, North Star, Reservoir, Seal, Tern, Umiat, andWest Sak. Yukon Pacific states that this supply may also be utilized toserve the market and needs of ANGTS should that project ever be completed.Yukon Pacific states that its supply procurement efforts will focus primarilyon purchasing natural gas produced from the Prudhoe Bay oil field and,in particular, the gas cap from Prudhoe Bay's main oil producing formation_theSadlerochit formation. Consideration will be given to any surplus gas fromthe Kuparuk field and the Endicott field as will as natural gas from Thompson/FlaxmanIsland.Since Yukon Pacific has not yet procured gas reserves to support the exportcontemplated by this application, it has not submitted any contracts. YukonPacific indicates that it will submit to the ERA all agreements with theNorth Slope producers when they are signed and before initiating the proposedexports. The application indicates that the contract terms with each producerwould be established through arms-length negotiation and would be flexibleover the term of the agreement to take into account changes in market conditions.The purchase price to be paid producers would be determined by a formulausing a base price per MMBtu adjusted for variations in the LNG sales priceat the point of destination, but would not exceed the ceiling price establishedby Section 109 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.In connection with discussions of the availability of North Slope reservesto the TAGS project, Yukon Pacific states that there is no law that explicitlyprohibits the export of North Slope natural gas. Yukon Pacific notes thatSection 12 of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act (ANGTA) providesthat exports of North Slope gas subject to the NGA and the Energy PolicyConservation Act, as well as to the requirements contained in Section 12itself. Since each of these statutes makes provision for exports of NorthSlope natural gas, Yukon Pacific concludes that, so long as these statutesare satisfied, North Slope natural gas may be exported. Yukon Pacific alsoindicates that no North Slope natural gas reserves have been ``dedicated''to interstate commerce under the provisions of Section 7 of the NGA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Export Markets</ITAG>Yukon Pacific states that the TAGS project would sell natural gas to purchasersin Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In support of its application, YukonPacific provided a June 1987 preliminary feasibility study for the TAGSproject that indicates Japan and Korea will require an increasingly supplyof LNG to meet growing energy requirements and that LNG from Alaska canbe competitive in those markets. The study determined that Taiwan couldprovide a spot rather than a base-load market. Yukon Pacific states thatit has entered into discussions with various parties in Japan, South Korea,and Taiwan interested in importing LNG, but that ERA export approval isrequired before it can obtain firm commitments from potential buyers. YukonPacific states that it will submit to the ERA all agreements with the Asianpurchasers when they are signed and before initiating the proposed exports.Yukon Pacific indicates that contracts with foreign purchasers would beachieved through arms-length negotiations and their provisons would beresponsive to international gas market conditions. The arrangements wouldbe for 25 years to coincide with the requested export authorization term.As presently contemplated, the delivered price of LNG sold under the proposedauthorization would start with a base price per MMBtu and would vary eachmonth according to a formula based upon changes in the average sellingprices of selected major crude oils.<ITAG tagnum="84">ERA Evaluation</ITAG>This export application will be reviewed pursuant to Section 3 of the NGAand the authority contained in DOE Delegation Order No. 0204-111. The decisionon whether the export of natural gas is in the public interest will bebased upon the domestic need for the gas and on whether the arrangementis otherwise consistent with the public interest, including the nationalenergy policy of promoting the efficient development of our natural gasresources through the efforts of private parties in the energy marketplace.In this regard, the ERA notes the <T3>Presidential Finding Concerning Alaska Natural Gas</T3> issued on January12, 1988 (53 FR 999, January 15, 1988). This finding states that ``exportsof Alaska natural gas would represent a judgement by the market that theenergy demands of American consumers can be met adequately from other sourcesat comparable or lower prices.'' The finding concludes that such exportswould not ``diminish the total quantity or quality of energy availableto U.S. consumers because world energy resources would be increased andother more efficient supplies would thus be available.'' In addition, they``would not increase the price of energy available to consumers since increasedavailability of secure energy sources tends to stabilize or lower energyprices.'' The finding also sets forth a policy of letting ``the marketplaceundertake a realistic consideration of various options concerning Alaskanataural gas.''Yukon Pacific asserts that the gas is not needed domestically and the exportis otherwise consistent with the public interest. The application containsnumerous statements to support these assertions. Parties that oppose approvalof the export should comment on the conclusions of the Presidential Findingand the specific statements of the applicant. Opponents will bear the burdenof demonstrating that the proposed export is not consistent with the publicinterest. Any party that seeks consideration of the economic feasibilityof the TAGS project must demonstrate the relevance of such considerationto a public interest determination. The ERA will presume that the economicfeasiblility of the TAGS project is not relevant to the extent that Americanconsumers do not bear any of the economic risks associated with the project.Yukon Pacific states that it is unrealistic to expect it to secure firmcommitments from producers and consumers prior to the receipt of the requisiteexport approval from the ERA. Yukon Pacific indicates that requiring firmcommitments before export approval would put the ``cart before the horse''and unnecessarily delay or prevent the TAGS project. The ERA recognizesthe unique aspects of producing and marketing natural gas from the NorthSlope of Alaska and may determine that firm commitments are not a prerequisiteto its decision on this case under section 3 of the NGA.The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires the ERA toconsider the environmental effects of gas export authorizations. In 1984Yukon Pacific applied to the Bureau of Land Management of the Departmentof the Interior (BLM) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) fora right-of-way to build the pipeline component of the TAGS project acrossFederal lands. In connection with the right-of-way application, the BLMand the Corps determined that under NEPA an environmental impact statement(EIS) for the proposed TAGS project should be prepared and jointly publisheda draft EIS in September 1987 (52 FR 34424, September 11, 1987) which addressesthe environmental consequences of the TAGS project, including the potentialenvironmental consequences on the Lower-48 states of exporting naturalgas from the North Slope of Alaska.The DOE is a cooperating agency andassisted in the preparation and review of that draft EIS. The ERA willnot issue a final decision to Yukon Pacific in this proceeding until ithas reviewed the final EIS and the DOE has met its obligations under NEPA.Yukon Pacific requested expeditious consideration of its application sothat it can secure firm commitments for prospective Pacific Rim purchasersand avoid possible forfeit of ``an $80 billion LNG market to Indonesianand other competing foreign suppliers.'' The ERA will attempt to complywith this request. A decision on whether additional written comments orother procedures are needed in this case, however, will be made when allresponses to this notice have been received and evaluated. Yukon Pacific also filed on December 3, 1987, an application at the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for permission to use Port Valdez asthe place of export (FERC Docket No. CP88-105-000). <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the application must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. Thefiling of a protest with respect to this application will not serve tomake the protestant a party to the proceeding, although protests and commentsreceived from persons who are not parties will be considered in determiningthe appropriate action to be taken on the application. All protests, motionsto intervene, notices of intervention, and written comments must meet therequirements that are specified by the regulations in 10 CFR Part 590.They should be filed with the Natural Gas Division, Office of Fuels Programs,Economic Regulatory Administration, Room GA-076, RG-23, Forrestal Building,1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-9478. Theymust be filed no later than 4:30 p.m., e.s.t., March 9, 1988.The Administrator intends to develop a decisional record on the applicationthrough responses to this notice by parties, including the parties' writtencomments and replies thereto. Additional procedures will be used as necessaryto achieve a complete understanding of the facts and issues. A party seekingintervention may request that additional procedures be provided, such asadditional written comments, an oral presentation, a conference, or trial-typehearing. Any request to file additional written comments should explainwhy they are necessary. Any request for an oral presentation should identifythe substantial question of fact, law, or policy at issue, show that itis material and relevant to a decision in the proceeding, and demonstratewhy an oral presentation is needed. Any request for a conference shoulddemonstrate why the conference would materially advance the proceeding.Any request for a trial-type hearing must show that there are factual issuesgenuinely in dispute that are relevant and material to a decison and thata trial-type hearing is necessary for a full and true disclosure of thefacts.If an additional procedure is scheduled, the ERA will provide notice toall parties. If no party requests additional procedures, a final opinionand order may be issued based on the official record, including the applicationand responses filed by parties pursuant to this notice, in accordance with10 CFR 590.316.A copy of Yukon Pacific's application is available for inspection and copyingin the Natural Gas Division Docket Room, GA-076, at the above address.The docket room is open between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday, except Federal holidays.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, February 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance L.
