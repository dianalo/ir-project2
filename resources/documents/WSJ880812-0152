Eva Robinson, a 28-year-old secretary in Chicago, isn't sure. &quot;It could mean a lot of things,&quot; she says, gazing at the bold headline, &quot;Lowest Prices Guaranteed,&quot; in a Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. newspaper advertisement for electronic gear. &quot;It could mean it's the lowest price they've offered all year. It could mean it's the lowest price, compared with the competition.&quot;    Mrs. Robinson is wrong on both counts. The guarantee refers to Ward's policy of matching a competitor's price for 30 days after a purchase -- if the customer finds an ad with a lower price for the same item.    Ad pitches like this are proliferating as retailers, facing intense competition, try to lure shoppers into their stores. Nowadays, discount chains and stores specializing in electronic goods, automotive products and home furnishings promote their price-matching policies with catchy slogans like &quot;lowest prices guaranteed,&quot; &quot;we won't be undersold&quot; or &quot;you'll never pay less.&quot; Sometimes the ads disclose details of the policies; sometimes they don't.    Now the pitches increasingly are coming under fire: In a widely watched case, the National Advertising Review Board, an industry self-regulatory panel, last month branded Montgomery Ward's lowest-price claim &quot;inaccurate&quot; and &quot;confusing.&quot;    Ward disagreed with the finding but agreed to modify its ads within three months. As a result, local regulators and Better Business Bureaus across the country are expected to crack down on other retailers who make similar claims. The bureaus in Missouri are already working with merchants and the state attorney general to write voluntary advertising guidelines on pitches for price-matching policies, among other things. &quot;We believe there has been a substantial amount of abuse in that area,&quot; says William L. Webster, Missouri's attorney general.    In New York City, which has some of the toughest consumer-protection laws in the country, officials are more blunt. &quot;'Lowest price guaranteed' is inherently deceptive,&quot; says Patricia Kruger, the general counsel for the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. &quot;If what they really mean is, 'We'll match any price,' they should say that in their ad.&quot;    The debate over lowest-price guarantees underscores a growing concern about the accuracy of retail advertising. New York City's consumer affairs department is suing Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. in state court in Manhattan for a number of allegedly misleading practices, including promoting discounted clothing prices without explaining whether markdown percentages were based on the usual price of the merchandise. J.C. Penney Co. faces similar charges in a suit brought by the state of Washington in state court in Spokane. Sears and Penney deny any wrongdoing. So does the Hecht's unit of May Department Stores Co., but it agreed to change some ads and paid $500,000 last month to settle a suit brought by Maryland in state court in Rockville. The suit charged Hecht's with using artificially inflated regular prices on mattresses to create the false impression that significant markdowns were being offered.    &quot;There is no question that for quite a while retail advertising was treated in a rather loose fashion, without too much regard for the facts and the store's ability to deliver,&quot; says Kurt Barnard, an industry consultant and the publisher of Retail Marketing Report. &quot;The Montgomery Ward decision is likely to make retailers wake up and realize that this is one area where carelessness cannot be condoned.&quot;    In the Ward case, the advertising review board took a strong stand. The board said the Chicago-based retailer couldn't use the phrase &quot;lowest prices guaranteed&quot; unless it monitored its competitors' prices and could prove that its prices are actually the lowest in any given market. The board said such a monitoring program would be difficult to maintain in today's highly competitive retailing environment.    Ward's practice of disclosing the conditions of its price-matching policy in fine print didn't satisfy the board. &quot;An asterisk after the claim places an undue burden on the consumer to (make) a full reading of this small-type disclaimer, which severely restricts the apparently unlimited lowest price claim,&quot; the board said in its decision.    The board suggested that Ward drop the word &quot;lowest&quot; and simply say &quot;Price Guarantee&quot; or &quot;Lower Price Guarantee&quot; along with a description of the conditions of its price-matching policy. It didn't say how prominent to make this description.    The board said, however, that Ward could continue to use the phrase &quot;we won't be undersold&quot; as long as its ads fully describe the store's price-matching policy.    During the case, Ward defended its advertising as &quot;truthful, accurate and clear,&quot; according to the panel's published decision. It also said some of its competitors use &quot;highly questionable claims.&quot; A spokesman declined to elaborate.    Some industry consultants play down the significance of ads that aren't crystal clear. &quot;There's always an opportunity that somebody will misunderstand the message,&quot; says Paul A. Koenigsberg, vice president of marketing strategy at the Management Horizons retail consulting unit of accountants Price Waterhouse. &quot;But our research shows that the majority of people who consume that kind of advertising see it for what it is and shop accordingly.&quot; In other words, most consumers understand &quot;lowest price guaranteed&quot; to mean a price-matching policy.    Leo J. Shapiro andamp; Associates, a Chicago consulting firm that tracks consumer buying trends, maintains that consumers aren't confused even if they find ads for two or more stores all guaranteeing the lowest prices. &quot;The consumer finds this useful because it means the stores are serious about lowering their prices,&quot; says George Rosenbaum, the firm's president.    Still, price-matching policies vary from store to store. Good Guys Inc., a San Francisco-based electronics chain, promises to beat a competitor's advertised price before a purchase, or refund 110% of the difference between its prices and its competitors' for 30 days after a purchase. Ward says it will refund 110% of the difference on electronic gear, but its guarantee applies only to sale items that it advertises. Sears, which started carrying brand-name electronics and appliances at some of its stores this month, says it will refund only the difference between its prices and those advertised by its competitors.    Moreover, most stores that promise to beat a competitor's price don't say by how much in their ads. For example, Tops Appliance City Inc., Edison, N.J., offers a $100 reward if it can't beat the best deal a customer can find in the state. Harrel Silverstein, vice president of sales and advertising director, says, &quot;At worst, we end up beating (competitors') prices by $10.&quot;    Still other stores make it difficult for customers to take advantage of price-matching policies. For instance, regulators in New York City are negotiating a settlement with an electronics chain, which they decline to identify, that promises to beat its competitors' prices but requires an ad with a picture and model number as proof that a competitor is offering a lower price. The chain also defines its competitors to exclude non-chain stores and stores that aren't authorized dealers, according to Ms. Kruger, the consumer affairs department's general counsel.    Even some retailers find the phrase &quot;lowest prices guaranteed&quot; confusing. Officials of Good Guys debated its meaning and in March rewrote their ads to say &quot;guaranteed low prices&quot; instead of &quot;lowest prices.&quot; Says Fay Landau, vice president of sales promotion: &quot;We realized we weren't being as clear as we meant to be.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
