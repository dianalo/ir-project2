WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voters in Britain, Ireland, Denmark, theNetherlands and Spain chose European Parliament members Thursdayafter election campaigns dominated by national rather thanpan-European issues.   In other European Economic Community nations _ Belgium, France,Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and West Germany _ voting takesplace Sunday.   Official results of Thursday's balloting will not be announceduntil voting ends in the other countries Sunday night. In Denmark,the vote count begins Monday morning.   A total of 7,126 candidates are vying for seats in the 518-memberParliament, which meets one week a month in Strasbourg, France.   Contenders represent 178 national parties of every politicalpersuasion.   Unofficial projections on Thursday's balloting offered a mixedpicture.   A British opinion poll saw Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservative Party losing four to 10 of its 45 seats, getting 38percent of the vote against 42 percent for the opposition LaborParty, which has 33 seats.   Labor turned the election into a referendum on Mrs. Thatcher's 10years in power at a time when Conservative support is at its lowestsince she won a third five-year term in 1987. People are concernedabout high inflation and interest rates.   Mrs. Thatcher sees planned European Community legislation as athreat to the free-market revolution she is carrying out in Englandwith mixed results.   In the Netherlands, an exit poll projected Prime Minister RuudLubbers' Christian Democrats will win two more seats from theirConservative coalition partners, giving them a total of 10 seats.The Conservatives now hold five seats. Labor Party would retain itsnine seats, according to the poll.   Spain was out of step with the general trend. Polls there showedthe Socialist Party of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez could lose asmany as four of its 28 seats. Conservative and centrist oppositionparties also were expected to post slight losses, leaving them ahalf dozen seats while the communist-led United Left coalition wasseen winning 5 seats, up from 3.   Spanish opposition parties see the election as a litmus test forgeneral elections to be held by June 1990.   Opinion polls predict balloting in all 12 member nations willboost socialists, who with 166 seats already are the largest factionin the assembly, and centrist Christian Democrats, who hold 112seats.   Green parties concerned with the environment hold 20 seats andare expected to do well, notably in West Germany and France.   Voting in Ireland coincided with national elections, as will bethe case Sunday in Luxembourg and Greece.   Especially in these nations, campaigns have highlighted nationalrather than European issues such as the plan to remove thecommunity's internal borders and create a single market by Dec. 31,1992.   The European Parliament is one of three institutions directlyinvolved in the community's lawmaking process. It must be consultedon single market issues involving the environment, research andtechnology, occupational health and safety.   It also approves some treaties with other countries andapplications for membership.</TEXT></DOC>
