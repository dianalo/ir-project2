Mr. Liedl declined to say whetherany members of Congress are targets of the study, which wascharacterized as a preliminary inquiry, not a full-scaleinvestigation.</LP><TEXT>   The criminal inquiry, which began five months ago, wasprompted by the same General Accounting Office study that ledto a recent report by the House Ethics Committee. The GAOfound last fall that present and past House members hadwritten 8,331 checks on insufficient funds over nearly ayear's span in 1989-90.   Mr. Liedl wouldn't indicate when a decision will be madeon any possible prosecutions.   In the meantime, some of the biggest abusers of thenow-defunct House Bank might find that they will be houndedby the Internal Revenue Service as well as by angryconstituents.   Some tax experts contend that if the lawmakers' overdraftsare big enough, they might owe significant back taxes to thefederal government. Under the law, those experts said, theoverdrafts could be considered as interest-free loans fromthe government. In that case, the amount of interest thatshould have been charged for the loans should be counted asincome.   As a result, the largest offenders in the House could owethe federal government thousands of dollars in taxes.   &quot;The big offenders are likely to find they have areasonably substantial tax problem as well as a publicrelations problems,&quot; said Don Alexander, a former IRScommissioner under three presidents and now a lawyer withCadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft. &quot;They might well hear from theIRS.&quot;   Some tax experts also questioned whether the House Bankitself might be exposed to liability for failing to properlynotify the IRS about the transactions.   The IRS declined to comment on the matter.   Most of the 355 present and former House members who havehad overdrafts in recent years won't have a tax problem. Theback-taxes law generally affects only individuals who have$10,000 in overdrafts at any one time.   But at least some of the biggest abusers may fall intothat category. The 24 worst &quot;abusers,&quot; who will formally benamed by the House Ethics Committee next week, were overdrawnby more than their next month's payroll deposit for eight ormore months during the 39 months that ended Oct. 3, 1991. Twomonths of deposits would exceed the $10,000 limit because thenet monthly pay for most members was about $7,000 during theperiod.   Lawmakers might escape paying extra taxes by assertingthat the overdrafts were used for business or investmentpurposes and that the interest would be deductible. But thatargument isn't a strong defense. The overdrafts were frompersonal checking accounts and probably were used forpersonal expenses. Besides, saying the overdrafts were usedto make business profits probably would create an even largerfuror for a politician than being overdrawn.   Separately, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid administration aides are inquiring into whether any topBush administration officials who are former House memberswrote bad checks at the House Bank. But he said that &quot;at themoment, we don't know.&quot;   Cabinet members who served in the House include DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, Veterans'Affairs Secretary Ed Derwinski, Labor Secretary Lynn Martin,Agriculture Secretary Ed Madigan and Interior SecretaryManuel Lujan. Deputy White House Chief of Staff Henson Mooreand Small Business Administration chief Patricia Saiki alsoserved in the House.   Though a preliminary review by White House counsel BoydenGray didn't indicate any problem for top administrationofficials, Mr. Fitzwater added that Mr. Gray is &quot;making acheck&quot; of the matter one more time.   Mr. Fitzwater declined to say whether the White House hadreceived specific new information indicating that any Cabinetmember had bounced checks. &quot;We aren't going to comment on anyindividual or what anyone has told us . . . until we'vechecked with everybody,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said. He did say thatMr. Bush didn't overdraw his account when he served in theHouse in 1967-71. Separately, Vice President Dan Quayledidn't bounce any checks as a House member &quot;as far as he canremember,&quot; according to spokesman Jeff Nesbit.   Congressional critics meanwhile seized on the House Bankscandal to call for changes in the way Congress operates.Consumer activist Ralph Nader wrote to House Speaker ThomasFoley (D., Wash.) and House Minority Leader Robert Michel(R., Ill.) warning of a &quot;citizen revolt&quot; and seeking repealof recent pay increases and an end to congressionalperquisites.   &quot;The congressional pastime of perks, pensions and paygrabs -- which are ever increasing and diversifying --distracts, compromises and corrupts Congress,&quot; Mr. Naderwrote. &quot;These never-ending indulgences damage seriously whatis left of Congress's moral authority to govern and toreceive respect of the people.&quot;   ---   Joe Davidson in Washington and John Harwood in Chicagocontributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
