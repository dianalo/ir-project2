The release of the U.S. trade deficit figure for March came too late to affect most markets, although worry about the results damped buying in Zurich, a trader said.    In Tokyo, stocks closed at their third high in five sessions as retail and other issues rallied amid exchange rate stability and an emphasis on domestic factors.    The Nikkei stock average, which fell 172.66 points Wednesday, rose 288.25 to 24651.44. The close surpassed the May 11 mark of 24608.22.    The first section index rose 14.28 to 2169.45. Turnover was about 1.1 billion shares, down from 1.2 billion Wednesday. Advancing issues outnumbered losers 614 to 292, while 114 issues were unchanged.    There was emphasis on more diverse fundamentals, such as department store sales, following Wednesday's currency rate-dominated market, traders said.    Yesterday started with a surge in export-led stocks amid the dollar's narrow meanderings around 140 Japanese yen and optimism that U.S. sanctions against Japanese imports will be lifted soon.    In the afternoon, retail issues gained in the wake of the late Wednesday report that sales at Tokyo department stores last month rose 6.5% from a year earlier.    The rally in retail and consumer-related issues also was fueled by reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has scrapped its controversial sales tax plan.    Among department stores, Marui surged 150 to 2860 yen ($20.40), and Mitsukoshi climbed 110 to 1620. Daiei, a large supermarket chain, rose 80 to 1640.    Among housing issues, Daiwa House sprinted ahead 90 to 2470 and Sekisui moved up 50 points to 2250. Toto, which makes bathroom fixtures, advanced 90 to 2630. Construction benchmarks were stronger, too, with Taisei up 100 at 1290.    Banking issues continued to weaken, following Wednesday's slump, because of government efforts to curb their lucrative currency speculation. Industrial Bank of Japan fell 90 to 4860. Mitsubishi Bank slipped 10 to 4040.    Although the market is still sensitive to exchange-rate pressures, traders said, emphasis on domestic demand may be a sign the Nikkei will continue to surge.    London stocks ended higher in moderate trading, helped by political news and several positive earnings reports, although late profit-taking trimmed the gains.    The 100-share index rose 16.6 points to 2180 -- its second consecutive record close and third high in five sessions. The Financial Times 30-share index rose 3.7 to 1684.2, a high.    Stocks opened firmer, underpinned by gains on Wall Street and an opinion poll showing the ruling Conservative Party with a 14 percentage-point lead over the opposition Labor Party.    The market gained more strength from a better-than-expected earnings report from Shell, which said net income fell to 698 million pounds ($1.17 billion) in the first quarter from 718 million pounds a year earlier. The result was at the higher end of expections and &quot;put some flip into the market,&quot; a broker said. Shell rose 29 pence to 13.28 pounds ($22.17).    Britain's other oil giant, British Petroleum, said net income in the first quarter rose to 458 million pounds from 22 million pounds a year earlier. BP shares rose 14 to 356. Saatchi andamp; Saatchi, the world's biggest advertising agency, said pre-tax profit doubled to 56.2 million pounds in the six months ended March 31 from 25.9 million pounds a year earlier. Its stock slipped 30 to 624, though, on worries that it may merge some of its units or acquire new ones, and lose some accounts through duplication or conflicts of interest.    Wellcome was up 18 at 447 on news the government would provide 1.5 million pounds to help fund hospital programs that use the company's drug, known as Retrovir, to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    Grand Metropolitan said first-half pre-tax profit rose 18% to 167.7 million pounds. The result was &quot;up to scratch,&quot; a broker said, and the stock rose 5 to 526.    On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, prices closed lower across the board in nervous trading as the market gave up most of Wednesday's gains amid, brokers said, uncertainty about the trend of the dollar and a lack of foreign buying.    Trading also was hurt by news that Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest commercial bank, will make a 15-for-1 rights issue totaling 2.6 million new shares at 450 marks ($250.70) each.    The announcement, combined with the bank's report that four-month operating profit was lower than a year earlier, sent the stock down 13.5 to 625.5.    In Singapore, prices surged again in near-record volume as the Straits Times Industrial Index rose 24.42 points to 1204.94, its second high in a row. Foreign and local institutions continued to pick up blue chip issues, brokers said, and some interest shifted to lesser stocks, with heavy trading in more speculative Malaysian issues.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
