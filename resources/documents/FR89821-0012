The first suchapplication was in 1966, when Congress extended the Act's coverage (includingthe prohibition against sex-based wage differentials adopted by the EqualPay Act of 1963) to employees of States and other public enterprises engagedin operating transit companies, hospitals, schools and related institutions.The constitutionality of this extension of the Act's coverage was upheldin <T3>Maryland </T3>v. <T3>Wirtz, </T3>392 U.S. 183 (1968).In 1974, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover virtuallyall public sector employees except those specifically exempt as holdersof a public elective office or employees appointed by such an office holderto be a ``member of his personal staff'' or ``to serve on a policymakinglevel'' or as an immediate advisor ``with respect to the office.''On June 24, 1976, the Supreme Court ruled in <T3>National League of Cities </T3>v. <T3>Usery, </T3>426 U.S. 833, that the minimum wage and overtime provisionsof the Fair Labor Standards Act could not constitutionally be applied toState and local government employees who are engaged in traditional governmentalactivities. The Court expressly overruled its earlier decision in <T3>Maryland </T3>v. <T3>Wirtz </T3>insofar as that decision upheld the application of the Act'sminimum wage and overtime provisions to public school and hospital employees.The Court's decision did not affect the continued application of the Act'sminimum wage and overtime provisions to employees engaged in activitieswhich are not traditional functions of government.Because the Supreme Court did not establish a test for distinguishing betweentraditional and nontraditional governmental functions for purposes of applyingthe Act's minimum wage and overtime provisions, the three-judge districtcourt to which the case was remanded requested the Secretary to proposea means of providing interpretative guidance to public employers in identifyingthe nontraditional functions which are constitutionally subject to theminimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Thecourt also indicated that the States and political subdivisions shouldnot be subject to an award for ``liquidated damages'' (over and above backwages) except as to activities which had already been identified as nontraditional.In response to this request, the Secretary submitted a proposal to thecourt for the amendment of the Secretary's enforcement policy stated in29 CFR 775 and a notification procedure for identifying traditional andnontraditional governmental functions. This proposal was approved by thecourt and published in final form in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 21, 1979 (see 44 FR 75628), by addingandSection;andSection; 775.2-.4 to Part 775.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of The Garcia Decision</ITAG>On February 19, 1985, the Supreme Court in <T3>Garcia </T3>v. <T3>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, et al., </T3>469 U.S. 528,overruled the <T3>National League of Cities </T3>decision. The court found authorityfor application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local governmentsunder the Commerce Clause of the Constitution and found that applicationof federal regulation on the basis of a governmental function being traditionalor nontraditional was unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.As a result, classification of state and local governmental functions astraditional or nontraditional became obsolete and unnecessary. Accordingly,29 CFR Part is amended by deleting andSection;andSection; 775.2, 775.3 and775.4.<ITAG tagnum="84">Publication in Final</ITAG>The Department of Labor has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B),that good cause exists for waiving public comment on this procedural amendmentto the regulation because such comment is unnecessary. This finding ismade because the changes made herein are necessitated by operation of lawas a result of the Supreme Court's reversal of its prior decision in <T3>National League of Cities.</T3>Regulatory ImpactThis document reflects the removal of interpretive or procedural regulationsfor which there is no current statutory or other legal authority.
