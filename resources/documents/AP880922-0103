Asked if Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who beganthe discussions with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, had``brought good news,'' the president replied, ``I think so.''   Reagan, who spoke briefly with reporters as he left the WhiteHouse for a trip to Texas, did not elaborate.   Later, however, State Department spokesman Charles Redman saidthe Soviets had provided ``some ideas'' to U.S. officials of theirproposals in advance. He declined to give details.   The talks may be the last full-scale review of relations betweenthe two superpowers before Reagan leaves office next January.   Going into the meetings with Shultz at the State Department,Shevardnadze told reporters he planned ``full-scope negotiations''and had with him ``specific proposals in many areas.''   Speaking through an interpreter, Shevardnadze said, ``We havenot come empty handed. As you can see we have a lot of baggage.''   He said the discussions would cover nuclear and space weaponsalong with conventional armaments and chemical weapons.   Shevardnadze said the two sides will take up continuingdifferences over interpretations of the 1972 Anti-BallisticsMissile Treaty and will seek to narrow the gap on their jointeffort to achieve reductions in strategic nuclear weapons.   Also on the table will be proposals for reducing air-launchedand sea-launched cruise missiles.   Shevardnadze arrived at the State Department two hours laterthan originally planned. U.S. officials said Shevardnadze had askedfor the delay, complaining that he was tired after histrans-Atlantic flight on Wednesday.   Shevardnadze's talks here will include separate meetings Fridaywith Reagan and Vice President George Bush. The latter encounter isbeing held at Bush's request, a U.S. official said, adding thatDemocratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has not asked for ameeting with the Soviet diplomat.   But Shevardnadze, during his remarks on arrival, appeared toleave open the possibility of a meeting with Dukakis.   With no new summit meeting on the horizon and no prospect for amajor arms reduction agreement, Shevardnadze's visit lacks some ofthe drama which has accompanied many of his previous 27 meetingswith Shultz dating back to 1985.   According to well established procedures, the agenda for thetalks includes discussions on nuclear issues, human rights,bilateral issues and Third World military conflicts in which bothcountries have an interest.   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway told reportersthere is no possibility that the two sides will be able to resolvedifferences before the end of the year on their mutual goal ofachieving 50 percent cuts in strategic ballistic missile warheads.Many of the unresolved issues involve ways to verify that each sideis fulfilling its commitment.   One area in which some progress may be possible centers on thePeaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty, which was approved during themid 1970's but never ratified.   Ridgway said the two sides are ``very close'' to a an agreementgoverning verification of the treaty, which sets ground rules foruse of nuclear weapons for such activities as building dams andaltering the course of rivers.   Once verification procedures are agreed to, the treaty will besubmitted to the Senate for ratification.   Shultz and Shevardnadze also planned to discuss verificationprocedures for a second unratified treaty which limits to 150kilotons the size of underground nuclear explosions each side maycarry out. As part of an experiment to improve verificationprocedures, experts from the two sides have been monitoring eachother's nuclear tests.   Perhaps the most serious area of arms control contention betweenWashington and Moscow involves a U.S. demand for the dismantling ofa Soviet radar facility at Krasnoyarsk.   The administration has said repeatedly that the installationviolates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty because it could beused to coordinate defense of Soviet missile silos or othermilitary facilities.   On regional issues, the two sides are encouraged by theprospects for agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign forcesfrom Angola and Namibia, a high priority administration goal.   But Moscow's decision to continue arms shipments to Nicaragua'sleftist government even after the U.S. military aid cutoff to theContra rebels has been a major disappointment for theadministration.   Administration officials have said that the Soviets have refusedto negotiate seriously on this issue.</TEXT></DOC>
