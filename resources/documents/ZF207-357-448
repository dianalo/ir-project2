Rezaul.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Time scale decomposition (TSD) algorithms are an effective step inreducing the computational complexity and numerical instabilityproblems in the application of a class of generalized stochasticPetri net (GSPN) models to systems with diverse activities withdurations that vary by an order of magnitude or more.andP;  Aneasy-to-use TSD algorithm is developed that decomposes a GSPNmodel into a hierarchical sequence of subnets, each valid at aspecified time scale.andP;  The subnets are solved separately, withresulting solutions integrated for a solution of the entiresystem.andP;  Development, analysis and decomposition of GSPNs aredescribed.andP;  Application of the TSD algorithm to a shared memorymultiprocessor system with random failure and repair is described.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AlgorithmsStochastic ModelSystems AnalysisPetri NetsSystem DesignTime Series.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Buffer-multiprocessor subsystem.
