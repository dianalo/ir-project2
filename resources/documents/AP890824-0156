Police reported widespread rioting linked to the campaign.   Officers used birdshot, rubber bullets, whips and tear gas todisperse protesters and rioters in 10 black and mixed-race townshipsnear Cape Town, police said.   Crowds threw stones, hurled firebombs and set street barricadesalight, they said.   Six officers were injured and seven people were arrested over a24-hour period, police said.   Anti-apartheid leaders coordinating the defiance campaign accusedthe government of distorting their intentions and challenged ActingPresident F.W. de Klerk to a nationally televised debate. There wasno immediate response from de Klerk's office to the challenge,announced at a news conference in Johannesburg.   The white women, members of the Black Sash civil rightsorganization, stood in a market square in central Cape Town holdingposters supporting the defiance campaign.   Police declared the demonstration illegal and ordered the womento disperse. When they refused to leave, they were led into a policebus.   About 200 black and white bystanders cheered in support of thewomen, among them Mary Burton, the president of Black Sash.   At the University of Cape Town, 1,000 students, both black andwhite, marched across a highway bordering the campus before beingdispersed by police using whips and tear gas.   Many students regrouped and marched back to the campus behind aprotester carrying the black, green and gold flag of the outlawedAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement.   Police headquarters described the marchers as ``aggressive,rioting students'' and said an officer was struck by a stone. Themarchers had demanded the lifting of a ban on a militant studentgroup.   Since anti-apartheid groups launched the defiance campaign onAug. 2, there have been almost daily confrontations between policeand demonstrators in the Cape Town area.   Police have broken up many protests, often with tear gas, anddetained dozens of activists. Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, aNobel Peace Prize winner, was among those tear-gassed at ademonstration on Wednesday.   Tutu on Thursday described the police account of the incident asa ``blatant lie,'' insisting he had emerged from a church beforetear gas was fired without warning at protesters outside. Policesaid Tutu was inside at the time and that a warning was issued.   Tutu also recounted his efforts to defuse volatile confrontationsbetween police and protesters, and demanded that police retract anallegation that he encouraged illegal actions.   The defiance campaign is aimed at ending segregation ofhospitals, schools, neighborhoods, beaches and other facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
