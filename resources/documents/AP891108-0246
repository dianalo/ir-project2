Thisis one of a periodic series of articles, ``The '90s,'' looking aheadto the promise and peril of the upcoming 10 years, in theenvironment, medicine, technology and society.</TEXT><BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fewer and fewer people will be entering theU.S. job market in the 1990s, and the dwindling flow will change theface of the factory and office _ and of American society _ in thecoming decade.   Women and minority-group members will account for over 80 percentof all new entrants in the labor force in the '90s, says the privatePopulation Reference Bureau.   In the 1970s, 24.1 million young people entered the workforce. Inthis decade, only 18.0 million did so. And in the 1990s, accordingto a bureau study, the number is expected to decline to 15.6million. Much of the dropoff is among non-Hispanic white males.   The coming change in the labor force will follow a decade, the1980s, of significant social transformation in the United States,lifestyle changes likely to continue through the coming 10 years.   Because improved medical care has extended lifespans, theAmericans who greet the year 2000 will be on average older and, ifnot wiser, at least better-educated than the ones who saw thecurrent century arrive. Other lifestyle trends: people are marryinglater and divorcing more, and women have become an important part ofthe workplace.   Forecasting into the next century, Carol J. De Vita, a seniorresearcher at the Population Reference Bureau, says technology maysolve part of the labor dilemma by eliminating the need for somejobs.   But many millions of new workers will still be needed, andemployers may have to turn to older people or immigrants, De Vitaexplained in an interview.   Some businesses, such as fast-food outlets, are already feelingthe pinch and have begun seeking out retired people to fill jobs.   ``Many of the jobs that younger workers do are entry level, sothe question is if someone with more experience would want to switchand gain some new skills,'' she said.   A second choice for labor-short companies may be immigration, ifforeign workers can be found with needed skills.   In fact, De Vita noted, some bills have been introduced inCongress to shift the focus and give foreign workers with desiredskills, rather than those with relatives in the United States,higher priority for immigration.   The growth of the U.S. population is expected to slow in the '90s.   Americans of the giant post-World War II Baby Boom generation arenow becoming parents, producing a relatively large number ofoffspring.   The ``Boomers'' were followed by a Baby Bust generation in thelate 1960s and 1970s. As this group reaches its childbearing yearsduring the 1990s, fewer potential parents will mean fewer offspring,unless the ``Bust'' generation sharply reverses the trend of recentdecades, during which people have postponed childbearing andeventually had smaller families than in years past.   The U.S. Census Bureau notes that the elderly constitute thefastest-growing group in the national population.   As of 1987, there were 29.8 million Americans age 65 or older,12.2 percent of the population. The Census Bureau says this groupwill continue growing into the next century, and will include oneAmerican in five when the bulk of the Baby Boom generation hassenior-citizen status, by about the year 2030. Census projectionsshow the elderly to be the only group to continue growing throughthe middle of the next century.   The boom in elderly will have a critical impact on health careand retirement-income programs, observes the Population ReferenceBureau study. But it also will provide more older candidates for thejobs De Vita sees going begging because of the decline in the numberof young workers.   Meanwhile, the ``traditional'' family of working husband, andwife staying home with the children, has largely disappeared. Fewerthan half of all families now have children. Even in families thathave offspring, most mothers held jobs outside the home as of 1987,the Census Bureau reports.   At the same time, the Population Reference Bureau noted, ``thegrowing incidence of divorce and out-of-wedlock births has fueled anenormous increase in single-parent families.''   Almost one in four children now lives with only one parent,compared with one in 10 in 1960, the Population Reference Bureaufound. ``The growing concern over child care, elder care andparental leave will continue well into next century,'' it concluded.   The Census Bureau reports that blacks now constitute 12.2 percentof Americans and Hispanics 8 percent _ meaning these two groupsaccount for about one in five Americans.   ``By 2000 nearly one-third of all school-age children will befrom minority populations _ a situation that presents a majorchallenge to our school systems,'' the Population Reference Bureaureports.   The growth of minority groups, like the change in the face of theworkforce, will present society with further new challenges _ in theeconomy, in politics and in the legal system, where affirmativeaction and related issues may become still more pressing.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues AMs, Nov. 14, and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
