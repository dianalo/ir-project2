Kennedy assassination, a public television broadcast this weekcasts doubt on many of the second gunman theories.   The JFK segment of the ``Nova'' series, narrated by former CBSNews anchorman Walter Cronkite, used available evidence _ and insome cases new scientific analyses _ to test theories that a secondgunman shot at Kennedy and that the wounds were altered to hideevidence of a conspiracy.   The program, which for the first time gained access to autopsyphotos of the slain president, concludes only that the availableevidence, even when put through modern-day scientific testing, isinconclusive on whether there was a second gunman.   The one-hour Public Broadcasting Service special, ``Who ShotPresident Kennedy,'' was scheduled to air Tuesday night, one weekbefore the 25th anniversary of the slaying.   Producer Robert Richter received permission from the Kennedyfamily to show 52 color and black-and-white autopsy photos to fourdoctors who were part of the emergency medical team that struggledto save the president in Dallas.   Each of the four doctors examined the photos individually behindclosed doors at the National Archives, where evidence from the JFKassassination is stored. They concluded that the wounds looked thesame as they did when the president arrived at Parkland MemorialHospital in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.   The testimony strikes directly at a cornerstone of the secondgunman theory: that Kennedy was shot from the front by a gunman onthe infamous grassy knoll as well as from behind by Lee HarveyOswald and that bullet wounds were altered somewhere between Dallasand the Washington autopsy to make it appear as though entrancewounds were actually exit wounds.   Nova received family permission to view the original autopsyphotos only by agreeing not to show them during the broadcast, butthe program does show, for the first time, several graphic autopsyshots of the slain president. Richter said they were copies obtainedby an outside source whom he declined to identify.   Richter used a computer model of Dealey Plaza to show how themuch-maligned ``single-bullet theory'' embraced by the WarrenCommission could be correct.   According to Richter's computer model, a single bullet fired fromthe sixth floor of the nearby Texas School Book Depository, whereOswald was perched, could have traveled through Kennedy's neck, ifhe had been bending slightly forward, and go through then-Gov. JohnConnally of Texas.   But the surgeon who operated on Connally in Dallas, interviewedon the program, doubted that the bullet could have done that damageand remain nearly intact. The bullet, recovered later at thehospital, had little damage.   Nova producers also had a fuzzy photograph, which some say showeda gunman on the grassy knoll, analyzed by scientists at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology and Polaroid Corp. Theanalysis was inconclusive.   The program did not explore other theories that say Oswald wasthe lone gunman but that he and Jack Ruby, the nightclub owner whoshot Oswald, were part of an organized crime or Cuban plot to killthe president.   Cronkite said additional tests on the bullet could be helpful toformulate a more conclusive opinion.</TEXT></DOC>
