The findings quickly ignited political pressure to speedup the elimination of chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons,which are used as refrigerants and solvents and which destroyozone in the upper atmosphere. Du Pont Co., a leadingproducer of CFCs, immediately said it would accelerate itsown schedule for phasing out destructive chemical compounds.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the report said that reducing CFCs may notprevent global warming, which is caused by gases trappingheat in the atmosphere. The Bush administration hasrepeatedly argued that CFC reductions would help stave offwarming.   Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist for theEnvironmental Defense Fund, said the findings required&quot;urgent&quot; international action to stave off skin cancer andcrop damage from increased ultraviolet radiation from thesun.   William Reilly, chief of the Environmental ProtectionAgency, said the U.S. already is far ahead of schedule inhalting production of the worst ozone-eating chemical butneeds to persuade developing countries to do the same.   The study marked the first time scientists have found thatheavy ozone depletion occurred during the summer, when peoplespend more time outdoors and crops are in their growingseason. The EPA estimates that the thinning of the ozoneshield will lead to as many as 12 million more skin cancersand more than 210,000 additional skin-cancer deaths in theU.S. during the next 50 years.   Heavy doses of ultraviolet rays also can stunt cropgrowth. But so far, experiments in Antarctica -- where acontinental-sized &quot;hole&quot; in the ozone layer opens mostsprings because of CFC chemistry -- have found hardly anydamage to plant life in the sea.   The panel, appointed by the World MeteorologicalOrganization and the United Nations Environment Programme,said that the ozone layer thinned a total of about 3% duringthe summer from 1979 to 1991, in heavily populated areas ofthe Northern hemisphere. The scientists said they expectedanother increase of similar size during the 1990s. Mr.Oppenheimer and a Du Pont scientist estimated that a 3%decrease in ozone can lead to a 6% increase in the amount ofultraviolet radiation that hits the Earth.   The Earth is wrapped in a layer of stratospheric ozonethat blocks out deadly ultraviolet rays. A series ofcomplicated reactions involving CFCs and other chemicals,including halons, which are used in fire extinguishers, candestroy this protective layer.   Under an international agreement, industrial countries arerequired to halt production of CFCs and other chemicals bythe year 2000. But Du Pont said it would quicken itsphase-out of CFC sales to industrialized countries to 1996and its sale of halons to the end of 1994. It also said itwould eliminate one of its CFC substitutes, HCFC-22, morequickly than would be required under federal law because itstill is detrimental to the ozone layer.   Faster phaseout of CFCs, which U.S. companies already arelearning to do without, also was quickly endorsed by acoalition of 500 CFC producers and users. The group, theAlliance for Responsible CFC Policy, said the ban on CFCs fornew products could be moved up to 1997 if the EPA quicklyapproves more substitutes.   Environmentalists called for amending the treaty on ozonedepletion, called the Montreal Protocol, at a conference nextsummer in Copenhagen by cracking down further on CFCs andphasing out some of the proposed substitutes. Mr. Reilly, theEPA chief, said the Bush administration hasn't yet staked outa position on whether to seek treaty changes.   The study also poked a gaping hole in the administration'sstrategy for dealing with global warming by casting doubt onthe role of CFCs in warming the Earth. Previously, scientistshad lumped CFCs with other so-called greenhouse gases thattrap heat on the Earth's surface. By reducing CFCs, theadministration argued, it was already fighting globalwarming.   ut the scientists now say that ozone depletion may coolthe Earth by blocking solar heat from reaching the surfacethrough an unexplained mechanism, even as CFCs heat the Earthby a similar amount. Thus, eliminating CFCs probably wouldn'taffect global warming, said Robert Watson, an atmosphericscientist at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, who co-chaired the panel. &quot;It's not clearwhether CFCs have warmed the atmosphere or not,&quot; he said.   In the study, the scientists looked at both ground-basedand satellite observations of the ozone layer at a latitudeof 45 degrees North. That runs through the U.S. atMinneapolis, through the middle of Europe and the southernSoviet Union. The satellite data said that the ozone layerhad thinned 2.9% during the months of May through August from1979 to 1991. Ground data put the depletion at 3.3%. Thesatellite-based figures could be off 2.1 percentage points;the ground-based data could be off by 1.2 percentage points,the report said.   At 45 degrees South, which cuts through southern Argentinaand passes slightly below Australia, depletion during thesummer months of December through March registered 5.2%, withan uncertainty of 1.5%. The team didn't report ground datafrom the Southern hemisphere.   The report attributed the thinning of the ozone world-wideto the spread of ozone-poor air from the poles and chemicalreactions involving CFCs and sulfur particles from volcanoes.But the scientists acknowledged they didn't fully understandthese mechanisms and suggested other factors may be at work.   But the study also suggested how difficult it is toestimate the effects of man on the environment. In the 1970s,atmospheric scientists predicted that a fleet of supersonictransport aircraft would eat away at the ozone layer --helping to doom the U.S. effort to build the jets. But thisozone study reversed course and reported that a fleet wouldhave little if any effect. NASA now is studying a new designfor such jets.</TEXT></DOC>
