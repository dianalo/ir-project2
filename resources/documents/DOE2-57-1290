Consequently, it has been necessary to select expensivesynthetic resin with the thermal deformation temperature of at least100{sup 0}C or more as the substrate base material. This invention hasbeen done in order to realize a highly reliable, low-cost and light-weightsolar cell module and its modularization method using the synthetic resinwith its thermal deformation temperature lower than the above heatingtemperature and proposes a solar cell module which is made by adheringa solar cell and a substrate utilizing the base material with low thermaldeformation temperature with a sheet adhesive and a method to laminatein vacuum the above solar cell and a substrate using a sheet adhesiveat or above the thermal deformation temperature of the base materialconcerned. Furthermore, the usage of the synthetic resin whose thermaldeformation temperature is 100{sup 0}C or less as the base material andthe usage of frames as required during the above lamination, etc. areincluded in the above proposal.
