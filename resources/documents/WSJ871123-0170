A Bain official said the cut followed the stock-market crash and an increase in computerized operations that reduced the need for staff. He said he believed that Bain hadn't been hurt more than Australia's other brokerages by the crash.    The Italian government approved a commercial credit granted by FIAT S.P.A. to Poland, enabling the auto maker to proceed with its project to produce small cars in the Eastern European nation. Under the September accord, Fiat will build the cars in conjunction with the Polish state-owned auto maker. The agreement is valued at 880 million West German marks ($526.9 million), half of which will be financed by the Fiat export credit and half by an international group of banks.    GOETABANKEN, Sweden's fourth-largest commercial bank, said that the head of its securities and finance department, Goeran Larsson, is leaving his post following losses of 200 million kronor ($32.9 million) incurred by the bank in the options market. The trading losses, resulting from improper trading by a single broker, could slash the bank's pretax profit this year to 300 million kronor from about 500 million kronor, according to an earlier statement by Goetabanken. The bank said it will shuffle responsibilities of its executive vice presidents to help provide stronger oversight of its activities.    PEUGEOT S.A. said consolidated revenue rose 18% in the third quarter, to 26.84 billion French francs ($4.72 billion) from 22.84 billion francs a year earlier, and 12% in the first nine months, to 85.29 billion francs from 76.14 billion francs. In the third quarter, the French auto maker said, export sales rose 25%, while domestic sales gained 14%. Peugeot said that &quot;the evolution of sales seen in the first nine months. . . is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.&quot;    French Economics Minister Edouard Balladur asked France's Fair Trade Committee to examine possible monopoly problems linked to the purchase of a 13.6% stake in SAINT LOUIS S.A., a French food group, by a unit of the Italian agro-industrial concern FERRUZZI AGRICOLA FINANZIARIA S.P.A. Saint Louis has noted that the Ferruzzi unit already owns 51% of Behin-Say S.A., which competes with Saint Louis in the French sugar market.    TSB GROUP PLC, a British commercial bank, said it controls 91.5% of the shares of the British merchant bank HILL SAMUEL GROUP PLC under its #777 million ($1.39 billion) takeover offer. </TEXT></DOC>
