Islamic Jihad said it killed Mohammed Ali Marzouqi, personnelofficer at the Saudi Embassy in Damascus, Syria, to avenge thebeheading of 16 convicted terrorists in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 21.   A typed statement in Arabic was delivered to a Western newsagency, accompanied by a picture of American hostage TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,to prove its authenticity.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, a Shiite group thatholds two other U.S. hostages, vowed to kill 10 Americans for any``revolutionary'' threatened by a recent U.S. Justice Departmentruling allowing American authorities to pursue and apprehendterrorists abroad.   Police said Marzouqi, 68, was climbing into his gray embassylimousine in west Beirut's Tallet Khayyat district when three menraked his car with fire from submachine guns equipped withsilencers. They said his Syrian driver was wounded in the righthand.   Marzouqi was a frequent visitor to Beirut. He handled paychecksfor Lebanese employees who act as custodians of the desertedembassy.   Saudi diplomats and personnel were evacuated in 1985, afterpro-Iranian Shiite zealots ransacked the embassy.   Iran and Saudi Arabia, which is predominantly Sunni Moslem, areat odds over who speaks for the world's nearly 1 billion Moslems.Saudi Arabia broke relations with Iran in April 1988, accusing itof subversion and terrorism.   Islamic Jihad said in the statement Wednesday: ``Several weeksago the rulers of Saudi Arabia, the servants of the devil,committed a massacre against 16 Moslem pilgrims from Kuwait.   ``They thought they had escaped (the consequences of) their act... but we will kill them wherever we find them.''   It claimed Marzouqi was ``one of the most senior Saudi securityofficers in Lebanon. His activities were not hidden from the eyesof our Mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors.   Revolutionary Justice did not mention Marzouqi. Its threat toAmericans was made in a handwritten statement in Arabic deliveredto the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar with a photocopy of anold picture of American hostage Edward Austin Tracy, who waskidnapped Oct. 21, 1986.   It was reacting to a Justice Department decision empowering FBIagents to arrest terrorists abroad, and a draft law before theCongress making terrorist attacks against Americans punishable bydeath.   Iran's parliament approved a law Wednesday authorizing thearrest anywhere in the world of Americans who acted against Iran.   In its statement, Revolutionary Justice said it would ``kill 10Americans for threatening the freedom or life of a singlerevolutionary.''   Saudis have been a target of worldwide terrorism in recentmonths, and pro-Iranian factions have claimed responsibility instatements from Beirut.   On Oct. 16, an embassy employee in Ankara, Turkey, lost bothlegs in a car bomb explosion.   A Saudi serving as a Moslem prayer leader in was killed inMarch, and an Egyptian driver for the Saudi Embassy there wasmurdered in June. The third secretary at the Saudi Embassy inThailand was killed in Bangkok in January.   The picture of Anderson accompanying the Islamic Jihad statementshowed him with a mustache, cutting a birthday cake, wearing a paleT-shirt and glasses.   Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and has been held longestof the 18 hostages in Lebanon. He was 42 on Oct. 27.   It was unclear whether the picture was new, or one of a seriesof similar pictures released in the past year. The cake in front ofhim looked different and appeared to have a single tier, ratherthan two as in the previous photos.   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 58, who was actingdean of agriculture at American University of Beirut when he waskidnapped June 9, 1985.   Revolutionary Justice holds Tracy and Joseph James Cicippio, 59,of Valley Forge, Pa., kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. Its statement didnot include a direct threat to them.</TEXT></DOC>
