Brig. Gen. Rudolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital RegionDefense Command, said those arrested included three former soldiersand two civilians. Four were arrested late Wednesday and the fifthwas captured today, Biazon said.   Biazon told reporters they included retired Master Sgt. DomingoEscarcha, alleged founder of the Black Force Commandos. Thecommandos, made up of renegade soldiers, took part in the 1986 coupattempt at the Manila Hotel and in other moves to topple the Aquinogovernment.   The arrests brought to nearly 70 the number of suspectedright-wing extremists arrested in recent weeks. They included Lt.Col. Eduardo Matillano, a leader of last year's bloody coupattempt, who was arrested Tuesday.   Biazon said that during the raids, police found copies ofdocuments pointing to financial support from unidentified ``outsidesources.''   On Wednesday, Biazon told a House of Representatives committeethat unidentified businessmen and opposition politicians were undersurveillance for possible links to military renegades, includingformer Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan.   Honasan led the failed coup Aug. 28, 1987, which killed at least53 people and wounded 300. Matillano was one of Honasan's keylieutenants during the failed coup.   Both were later arrested but escaped separately last April.   In Wednesday's congressional testimony, Biazon said the businessexecutives and politicians were providing ``financial support and apolitical component'' to the anti-Aquino movement.   He said the military was collecting evidence ``before we take upaction.''   The opposition Union for National Action, led by Vice PresidentSalvador Laurel, has demanded in a statement that Mrs. Aquinorelease immediately the names of all those suspected of links toHonasan and other rebel soldiers.   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the vice chairman of theunion, denied he was personally linked to the mutineers and said hewas ready to defend himself in court if the government tried toimplicate him.   Enrile was fired as defense minister in 1986 after a failed coupby his followers. Honasan was Enrile's chief of security when heheld the defense post.   Also today, police shot and killed four people after they robbedan American army officer who had just arrived at Manila's airport,and soldiers killed six other people in another incident nearManila's airport, officials said.   Police identified the robbery victim as Army Capt. MichaelSmith. They said four armed men stole his luggage and valuables,then sped off in a car and were later chased by police officers.   Soldiers killed six people they said refused to stop at acheckpoint, officials said. Troops claimed the occupants openedfire, triggering a shootout near the Manila airport. No casualtieswere reported among the soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
