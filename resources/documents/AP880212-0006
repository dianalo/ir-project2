It would have been too much tobe found guilty of cruelty to my 2,000 hens,'' Karl Wettre wasquoted as saying by the national NTB news agency after hisacquittal.   The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animalsclaimed that by keeping hens in small cages, Wettre violatednational legislation to allow animals' natural development andbehavior.   But the court found that Wettre observed Norwegian regulationsstipulating that a hen should have at least 112 square inches ofcage space in which to live.
