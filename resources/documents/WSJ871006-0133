KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM LABORLABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp. agreed to pay a $500,000 fine to settle Labor Department charges that it willfully violated record-keeping regulations.    The fine is the largest an employer has agreed to pay in a record-keeping violation case. But in recent months, the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed larger ones, including one for penalties totaling $2.6 million against Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s IBP Inc. unit.    GM agreed to pay its fine to settle OSHA charges that it willfully failed to report adequately on injuries and illnesses at four facilities during 1986. The No. 1 auto maker agreed to the settlement without admitting guilt as to the allegations.    In Detroit, GM said it settled to avoid lengthy legal proceedings. The company added: &quot;The alleged violation only related to record-keeping and didn't compromise the safety or health of our work force or place any of our employees at risk.&quot;    OSHA defines a willful violation as one in which an employer knew about workplace health or safety conditions that don't meet federal requirements, or was aware of a hazardous condition but didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    The settlement covers OSHA citations against GM's Oklahoma City plant; its Leeds plant at Kansas City, Mo.; its Delco Electronics plant at Oak Creek, Wis., and its service-parts operations at Martinsburg, W.Va.    GM agreed to correct immediately the injury and illness logs for 1986 at the four facilities, and to bring by October 1988 its injury and illness recording practices into compliance with federal standards at all of its more than 140 U.S. facilities, said George Salem, solicitor of labor.    OSHA said GM also will investigate the causes of occupational injuries and illnesses affecting GM workers.    OSHA's citations at the four GM plants included ones for failing to record or for improperly recording a wide range of injuries, including fractures, burns, back strains and repetitive-motion disorders, the agency said.    OSHA has concentrated on paper work violations as it has increased its enforcement efforts in the past year and a half. The agency's critics say OSHA needs to do more to improve workplace health and safety directly, rather than just imposing fines for reporting omissions. But OSHA officials defend their focus on paper work, insisting they can't deal adequately with substantive work-site violations until they have full and accurate reporting by employers. </TEXT></DOC>
