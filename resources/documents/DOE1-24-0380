Specifically, results were presented ofa field survey of sugar cane field workers in Florida. Determinationswere made of the airborne concentration of amorphous silica fibers towhich these workers were exposed. The airborne fibers ranged in sizefrom 3.5 to 65 micrometers long with an average diameter of 0.6 micrometers.The concentration of these fibers in the air was as high as 300,000 fibersper cubic meter during cane-cutting activities. Polyaromatic hydrocarbonconcentrations were detected in the burnt leaf, but the concentrationsin air were well below the limit of detection. The author recommendsthat comprehensive monitoring be considered for exposure to biogenicfibers among field workers, as well as refinery workers. The author alsosuggests that exposure to biogenic silicates in other industries whichinvolve processing of agricultural commodities should be investigated.Solubility and persistence of these particular fibers in biological fluidsshould be considered.</TEXT></DOC>
