Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn last week denied motions by Lilco to dismiss a $2.9 billion civil suit that charges the utility defrauded its customers by lying to the New York Public Service Commission in order to get rate increases tied to the construction of Lilco's Shoreham nuclear power plant. Judge Weinstein set Sept. 26 for the jury trial and suggested he expects the trial to last only a few weeks.    Lilco has said it faces bankruptcy if it loses the suit, a condition that would likely lower the offering price of the Long Island Power Authority. At the same time, the public agency could just as well use the suit as a face-saving way to delay a takeover bid. That, in turn, would give more time for a negotiated settlement between Lilco and New York state. Those talks have temporarily stalled over several financial issues.    Sources close to the talks say such a settlement generally would kill off Shoreham while keeping Lilco an investor-owned utility.    Long Island Power Authority &quot;has been overambitious in its strategy,&quot; said Daniel Scotto, utility-bond analyst for L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., referring both to problems the public agency could face raising $9 billion in the municipal bond market, plus possible legal challenges by Lilco to any plan the agency develops for meeting Long Island's future energy needs. Judge Weinstein's decision gives the agency &quot;an excuse to put the takeover on a back burner,&quot; Mr. Scotto said.    A spokesman for Long Island Power Authority said while the authority &quot;will continue to consider&quot; everything that affects Lilco's financial condition, the lawsuit won't affect the &quot;timing&quot; of &quot;deliberations&quot; by the agency's board. The spokesman also said the board isn't locked into any timetable for making a takeover bid when and if such a bid is decided upon.    Yesterday, both the plaintiff in the suit, Suffolk County, N.Y., and Lilco claimed the upper hand.    Judge Weinstein's ruling &quot;is a tremendous victory for the Suffolk County Legislature,&quot; said county legislator Wayne Prospect. &quot;We will now have the opportunity to prove that, for the past 14 years, Lilco has deliberately lied to the PSC and, as a result of those lies, Lilco collected $2.9 billion in fraudulent rate increases from the public -- approximately 30% of our electric bills -- to pay for Shoreham.&quot;    Susan Silverman, Lilco's assistant general counsel, said, &quot;It's almost laughable&quot; Suffolk County is claiming to have documents proving Lilco lied to the PSC. Ms. Silverman said the utility will soon file new motions to have the suit dismissed, adding that Lilco denies all the allegations.    Also yesterday, Lilco's stock gave up nearly half of its sharp Friday run-up, dropping 75 cents a share to close at $9.25 on volume of 696,000 shares. Friday's $1.75-a-share surge in the stock price had been fueled by takeover speculation caused by Lilco publicly demanding that the Long Island Power Authority make its &quot;best offer&quot; now. Investor enthusiasm cooled considerably in the wake of reports that Lilco's demand was a bargaining tactic aimed at getting its talks with the state back in high gear.    Those talks originated to find a way to cancel the completed but unlicensed Shoreham plant, while in turn offering Lilco assurances it would be kept financially whole, and that its power supply problems would be dealt with without Shoreham. </TEXT></DOC>
