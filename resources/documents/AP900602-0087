The three days of talks toward ending the 11-year-old civil warare mired in dispute even before their scheduled start Monday. TheHun Sen government supported by Vietnam refuses to consider givingan equal voice to Sihanouk's powerful Communist allies, the KhmerRouge.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to end three years of rule bythe Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, whose repressive policies are blamedfor the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians.   Sihanouk, who also represents two non-Communist guerrilla groupssupported by the United States, said in Beijing that he will signthe cease-fire accord with Premier Hun Sen ``to show the good willof the resistance and in order to show that I am in favor of a quickreturn of peace in Cambodia.''   But he said the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three guerrillafactions, have told him they are unhappy with the agreement craftedby Thailand's defense minister, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.   The Khmer Rouge claim Vietnamese troops still occupy Cambodiadespite a massive pullout last year and that Vietnam has annexedCambodian territory.   ``So there will be a possibility that in Tokyo the Khmer Rougewill more or less sabotage the peace process,'' Sihanouk said.   He also criticized Hun Sen for saying that Khmer Rouge leaderKhieu Samphan should not be allowed to sign the peace accord. Byostracizing the Khmer Rouge leader, Sihanouk said, ``indirectly HunSen encourages the Khmer Rouge to go on fighting.''   Sihanouk said there will be no effective body to oversee thecease-fire, and he called for reconvening the Paris Conference onCambodia, which ended in failure last year.   Resistance forces led by the Khmer Rouge have launched majorattacks in recent days in a drive to expand areas under theircontrol before the June 4-6 Tokyo meeting.   Guerrilla leaders and diplomats say the Khmer Rouge have made themost substantial gains, but the pro-Hanoi government of Hun Sen alsohas been active on the battlefields.   Sihanouk, 67, was not available to reporters upon arriving inTokyo. He held a 55-minute meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifuand thanked him for agreeing to a Thai suggestion to host theconference, a Foreign Ministry official told reporters.   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Sihanouktold Kaifu he had made a major compromise in recently proposing thattwo sides _ his guerrilla coalition and the Hun Sen government _make up a national council to prepare for elections.</TEXT></DOC>
