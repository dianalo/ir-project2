BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bankers will reap more that $700 million in feesfor their participation in history's largest deal, according togovernment documents filed in the wake of the $24.53 billion buyoutof RJR Nabisco Inc.   Company directors, meanwhile, said Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co.'s vow to retain some of the company's food operations andpreserve the benefits of terminated employees tilted the scalesagainst the management group led by Chief Executive F. Ross Johnsonin the buyout battle.   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissionsuggest investment and commercial bankers would get as much as$711.88 million in fees for arranging financing for Kohlberg's $109cash-and-securities offer for each share of RJR stock.   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. would take home the lion's share ofthe fees, getting an estimated $226.88 million. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.would receive $109.38 million, while Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. andWasserstein, Perella andamp; Co. would get $25 million each.   In addition, a syndicate of four banks _ Bankers Trust Co. ChaseManhattan Bank, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. _ wouldsplit $325 million for lining up $14.5 billion in bank loans.   Drexel could also end up with 4 percent of RJR Nabisco, whileMerrill Lynch would get 2 percent.   Although the dollar amounts are huge, the percentages are low forleveraged buyouts.   ``Of course, we don't have much to compare it with,'' WilliamCurt Hunter, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta whohas studied fees paid investment bankers, said Thursday.   The previous record fee for a leveraged buyout was the $49million paid in the 1986 $6.1 billion sale of Beatrice Cos., alsobought by Kohlberg.   According to the filing, the fees break down this way:   _A 1.5 percent commitment fee and .05 percent funding fee toDrexel Burnham for a $3.5 billion bridge loan; Merrill Lynchreceives the same fees for a $1.5 billion bridge loan.   _Drexel Burnham and Merrill Lynch each will receive another 3.62{percent when they replace the $1.5 billion bridge loans with junkbonds.   _Drexel Burnham gets another 3.87{ percent for the remaining $1.5billion in junk bonds.   _The four investment bankers get $25 million each for otherservices, including advice and financing.   ``Although these dollars seem excessive, they're probably not ifyou look at the risk,'' Hunter said.   ``There's a lot of risk involved, and also underwriting the junkbonds,'' he said. ``There's a real question if the market can absorbthis amount of financing.''   Also in the filing, Kohlberg disclosed 10-year businessprojections made by RJR management and provided during thenegotiations.   Profits for the nation's 19th largest industrial company areexpected to jump from $1.4 billion in 1988 to $4.6 billion by 1998,with tobacco continuing to provide most of the profit, the filingsaid.   By 1998, sales of the company's tobacco products, includingWinston, Salem and Camel cigarettes, are projected to go from $6.1billion a year to $15.7 billion a year, with operating income fromtobacco climbing from $1.9 billion to $5.5 billion.   Food sales _ Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, DelMonte vegetables and others _ could go from $9.9 billion to $18.5billion, with operational income rising from $1.1 billion to $2.4billion.   Kohlberg has said it may sell as much as $6 billion worth of thefood business, especially in areas that may raise antitrustquestions because of KKR's Beatrice holdings.   However RJR's board said in a separate SEC filing that itaccepted Kohlberg's offer in part because it ``contemplatedretention of substantial portions of the company's food business,while the revised management group's proposal contemplated the saleof all the company's food businesses.''   Another plus for Kohlberg was its willingness ``to provide forthe preservation of benefits for employees whose employment would beterminated as a result of the business divestitures whilerepresentatives of the management group were unwilling to providefor the preservations of such benefits.''   The board opened the bidding to all-comers after Johnson'soriginal $75-a-share offer on Oct. 20, and extended the auction toseek higher offers, including taking post-deadline offers from bothsides.   The filing said a final decision was made Nov. 30 to declareKohlberg the winner because ``the risk that further negotiation witheither the management group or KKR could result in the withdrawal ofeither party from the bidding process, which could have adverselyaffected the (board's) special committee's ability to achieve thehighest and best offer for the company.''   While the SEC filings reveal some of the details of the offer,there is no indication yet about the future of some of theexecutives who were involved Johnson's bid.   Kohlberg partner Henry Kravis, visiting R.J. Reynolds TobaccoCo., in Winston-Salem, N.C. earlier this week, repeated his plansfor Johnson to leave the company after the deal is completed, to bereplaced in the interim by former RJR chief J. Paul Sticht. Howeverhe said tobacco chief Edward Horrigan may be kept on.   Horrigan was the No. 2 man in the seven-person management groupand his departure had been expected. However Kravis said, ``The dooris open for discussion with Mr. Horrigan.''</TEXT></DOC>
