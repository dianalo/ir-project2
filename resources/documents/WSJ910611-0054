The SEC alleged that Anthony M. Morelli, director ofheadquarter services at Philip Morris's Park Avenue office inManhattan, gained access to the inside information whilepreparing a meeting room for company executives, just hoursbefore the takeover was announced.</LP><TEXT>   In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SECsaid that Mr. Morelli passed the information on to hisson-in-law, a stockbroker. The son-in-law, Frank S. Petrone,then informed his colleague James Zanengo as the two brokersheaded out for a game of golf, the SEC said in the suit. TheSEC alleged that Mr. Zanengo in turn tipped off two otherbrokers, who weren't named as defendants in the lawsuit.   All of the alleged illegal securities transactionsoccurred the afternoon of Oct. 17, 1988 -- a few hours beforePhilip Morris announced its tender offer, after the stockmarket had closed. On Oct. 18, Kraft common stock soared to$88.50 a share, up $28.375, on volume of 7.8 million shares.   The SEC said the total profit from the alleged insidertrading was $333,973.   In its suit, the SEC said Mr. Petrone, a broker at Rickelandamp; Associates in Millburn, N.J., made illegal trading profitsof $104,271 by purchasing Kraft call-option contracts beforethe deal was announced. The SEC said Mr. Petrone, 29 yearsold, bought the call options for $1.75 each on Oct. 17, andthen sold them for $43.50 each two weeks later.   The SEC alleged that Mr. Zanengo made total profits of$66,463 on Kraft call option contracts he bought on Oct. 17.   The SEC said in the suit that Mr. Zanengo tipped off FrankHusek, a broker at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.'s office inMillburn, and Victor Ricciardelli, another Rickel broker. TheSEC suit said Mr. Husek made a profit of $122,866 on Krafttransactions for a partnership he belonged to. The SEC alsosaid Mr. Ricciardelli made a profit of $40,373 on histransactions.   Neither Mr. Husek nor Mr. Ricciardelli were named asdefendants in the SEC lawsuit. The suit said Mr. Zanengopassed on information that caused the two men to buy Kraftsecurities, but doesn't allege that they knew their tradingwas based on inside information. The lawsuit seeks to recoverMr. Husek's and Mr. Ricciardelli's profits from Mr. Zanengo,30, of Berkeley Heights, N.J. Mr. Zanengo currently is acertified public accountant.   Mr. Morelli, who is still employed at Philip Morris,didn't trade on the alleged inside information, according tothe SEC suit. But the commission asked the court to hold bothMr. Morelli and Mr. Petrone responsible for Mr. Petrone'salleged illegal profit. The lawsuit also seeks additionalinsider-trading penalties against the three defendants.   Diana Parker, an attorney for Mr. Morelli at the law firmof Morvillo, Abramowitz andamp; Grand, said Mr. Morelli did nothingwrong and &quot;intends to contest the allegations to theirfullest.&quot; A spokesman for Philip Morris said Mr. Morelli isin charge of administering the headquarters building, butdeclined to comment on the SEC lawsuit.   Edward Rubin, an attorney for Mr. Zanengo, said his client&quot;expects to be vindicated and cleared of any wrongdoing.&quot;   Robert Fogelnest, an attorney for Mr. Petrone, said, &quot;Weintend to contest the allegations, and I'm certain that afterthis matter is resolved, Mr. Petrone will be vindicated.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
