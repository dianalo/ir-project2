<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-1081 </DOCNO><TEXT>A survey is presented on stirred tank reactors and cascades of stirredtanks applied in industrial polymerization (bulk, solution, precipitation,grain and emulsion polymerization). Special attention is given to variousdesigns of both agitator and cooling devices. Scale-up problems arisingfrom the variety of unit operations (homogenization, suspension, dispersion,heat transfer), carried out in stirred vessels, are explained, and thedifferent methods of indirect cooling (jacketed tank, internal coil,external heat exchanger) are assessed and compared with evaporative cooling.Finally, safety measures in operating polymerization vessels are discussed.(orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
