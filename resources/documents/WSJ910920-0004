That's a tricky question for small investors. Betting onemerging stock markets has always been perilous, but it canbe especially treacherous for folks who only have a fewthousand dollars to invest.</LP><TEXT>   Here's why. For smaller investors, the main way to dabblein emerging markets is through single-country funds, whichmake their money by buying the stocks of a single foreigncountry. These funds are notoriously volatile, sometimesgenerating dazzling gains, occasionally posting rapid anddevastating losses.   Until two years ago, these funds were little more than astock-market curiosity. At the beginning of 1989, there werejust 14 of these country funds, seven of which specialized inemerging markets.   But in what ranked as Wall Street's last great hurrah ofthe 1980s, country-fund fever ripped through the stock marketin late 1989. Investors bid up the prices of many countryfunds to exorbitant levels, prompting fund managers to bringout a slew of new funds.   That deluge of funds, plus the bear market sparked by theIraqi invasion of Kuwait, eventually sent country-fund pricesreeling. But country-fund fever did have a lasting legacy:Today, there are 32 country funds representing 23 nations,with combined fund assets of $4 billion. Half of these fundsspecialize in emerging markets, including those of Brazil,Chile, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, thePhilippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.   But these funds aren't for the faint of heart. While somehave posted spectacular gains, many have suffered agonizinglosses. In the year ended June 30, for instance, the ChileFund soared 83.7%, while the Turkish Investment Fund plunged50.8%.   &quot;These things are pretty volatile,&quot; notes Ron Olin, a fundspecialist with Houston's Deep Discount Advisors. &quot;It'sreally not a game for amateurs.&quot;   In the 12 months ended June 30, the share price of theaverage country fund slipped 5%, after adjusting fordividends. Country funds specializing in emerging marketssuch as Indonesia and Thailand, as well as those that buyEuropean stocks, were especially hard hit, with some fundsdown over 20%. In the same period, the average stock mutualfund gained 5.2%, according to Lipper Analytical Services.   That miserable performance has scared away a lot ofinvestors, but it has intrigued some fund specialists, whothink now may be a good time to do some bargain hunting.&quot;It's a reasonable time to begin picking your spots among thesingle-country funds,&quot; says Mr. Olin. &quot;As a long-termproposition, some of the funds are attractive&quot; at currentprices.   Country funds are so-called closed-end funds, which meansthat they operate quite differently from regular mutualfunds. A regular mutual fund stands ready to sell new sharesto investors at any time, and the share price quoted in thenewspaper each day fully reflects the value of the securitiesowned by the fund.   By contrast, closed-end funds issue only a fixed number ofshares, which then trade publicly just like any other stock.A closedend fund's stock trades independently of the value ofthe securities owned by the fund. Thus, a fund can be boughtfor more or less than its underlying portfolio value.   Closed-end funds are initially sold at a 7.5% premium tothe fund's portfolio value. But once the initial publicoffering period has passed, closed-end funds tend to slip toa discount, so that new investors can sometimes buy thesefunds for 85 cents or 90 cents on the dollar.   That's what has happened with many of the country funds.Today, half of the emerging-markets funds trade at discounts.   Mr. Olin believes those discounts are justified. He notesthat the average country fund charges annual expenses equalto 1.9% of fund assets, which is a cost investors wouldn'tincur if they bought foreign stocks directly.   As a result, says Mr. Olin, &quot;you need approximately a 10%discount just to make up for the expenses.&quot; But becausecountry-fund share prices swing fairly sharply, a 10%discount &quot;isn't enough to compensate for the risk,&quot; heargues. He thinks investors should avoid emerging-marketcountry funds unless they can buy them at discounts of atleast 20%.   Mr. Olin suggests that investors buy a variety ofdifferent country funds. That can dampen the overallvolatility of a portfolio, because funds tend to do well atdifferent times, with one fund soaring while another isgetting whacked.   But many investment advisers remain leery. George Foot, amanaging partner with Newgate Management Associates,dismisses the funds as &quot;gambling chips. They pervert the realadvantages of diversifying internationally and instead turnit into a country-picking game. The country-fund approach isbased on the assumption that a small investor in Kansas Citycan pick between global markets the same way an experiencedinternational portfolio manager can.&quot;   Mr. Foot believes a good global portfolio manager can addvalue by shifting money between different countries based onthe outlook for each nation's stock market, economy andcurrency. Because country funds restrict a fund manager topicking from among just one country's stocks, you take awayone of the tools by which the manager can add value, Mr. Footsays. And because country funds are so narrowly focused, theytend to be far more volatile than funds that buy stocks froma host of different countries.   That's why Kenneth Gregory, editor of L/G No-Load FundAnalyst, a San Francisco newsletter, is interested in some ofthe newer funds that buy stocks from a variety of differentemerging markets. These funds could eventually supplantcountry funds as the main way for small investors to bet onemerging markets. But for the moment, only a handful of thesefunds exist, most of which Mr. Gregory ignores because theyaren't fully invested in emerging markets or because they areonly sold through brokers and thus charge a sales commission.   But there is one fund that Mr. Gregory likes: TempletonEmerging Markets Fund, a closed-end fund. &quot;The fund has puttogether some fabulous performance numbers in its shortlife,&quot; notes Mr. Gregory. Since its launch in March 1987, thefund is up 149.2%, compared with a 57.8% gain for theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index.   &quot;In terms of a true emerging-markets fund, Templeton isprobably the only choice,&quot; Mr. Gregory argues. But thatuniqueness comes at a price. Shares of the Templeton fundtend to trade at, or above, the value of the securities heldin the fund's portfolio. Those who want both emerging-marketsexposure and bargain prices will have to stick withsingle-country funds.   ---   Mr. Clements covers Mutual Funds from The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
