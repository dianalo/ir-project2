The report, released by members of the congressional JointEconomic Committee, said the newly emerging democracies in EasternEurope could be rocked by unrest if the public is unwilling toaccept hardships for years to come.   ``The public's tolerance for prolonged austerity will be the keyto the success of the reforms, and it remains largely untested,even in Poland,'' the report said.   ``As long as aggressive implementation of austerity measurescoincides with consumer shortages and a prolonged decline in livingstandards, there will be a risk of public protest that could setback reforms and economic recovery,'' CIA analysts wrote in theirreport.   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said the report underscored that the``road to economic well-being will be long and arduous'' for thenations of Eastern Europe.   Unemployment will be a big problem as countries try to transformtheir centrally planned economies into those dominated by marketforces.   ``Unemployment is likely to soar if the new governmentsvigorously pursue plans to break up large single-enterprise statemonopolies, restructure their economies ... eliminate statesubsidies and let the market determine winners and losers,'' thereport said.   In Poland, joblessness could easily exceed 1.5 million, or 9percent, the study said. Unemployment is forecast at 15 to 20percent in East Germany and Yugoslavia, and 5 percent or more inBulgaria and Hungary.   The new democracies have economic hangovers because of fourdecades of economic mismanagement under communist governments.   The problems include ``slow or stagnant growth, decliningproductivity, energy-intensive and obsolete heavy industries, heavyforeign debts, poor-quality goods and non-competitive exports,massive environmental problems and deteriorating infrastructures,to name a few.''   Others economic problems also threaten Eastern Europe, theanalysts said.   For instance, heavy debt burdens and poor prospects forincreasing export revenues will make it difficult for countries topay their debts and modernize their economies.   Then, countries will have to determine how to distribute wealth,the report said. The struggle over privatization could be intense.   On top of the economic squeeze is the inexperience of the newgovernments, some of which are coalitions of divergent groups, theCIA report said.   Western nations will play a big role in getting the newdemocracies on their feet with financial aid and privateinvestment, the study said, adding that joint ventures are viewedas particularly crucial.   While governments seem eager to help Eastern Europe, long-termeconomic development will depend on how much private investmentpours into the region, it said. Bank lending to the region alreadyshows signs of drying up, the report said.   Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University professor who has workedwith the Polish government, said the United States must move tobecome actively involved in development of the Soviet Union.   ``Let's make clear to the Soviet Union that we will supporteconomic reform in a measured, careful way,'' he said.   It is important for the Soviets to know _ at a time of greatinsecurity and uncertainty _ that there ``is help out there,''Sachs said.   Last weekend, President Bush proposed spending $300,000 to startup a volunteer corps to provide assistance to the democracies inEastern Europe.   A similar proposal was introduced in the Senate in March bySens. David Pryor, D-Ark.; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; and SladeGorton, R-Wash.</TEXT></DOC>
