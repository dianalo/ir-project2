An additional $4.2 billion is budgeted for environmental cleanup.;  But congressional critics and several state government agencies contend thatmore than $1 billion a year will continue to be spent on plants that havestopped operating, are winding down or are closing.;   Department spokeswomanDeborah Smith acknowledged that the department planned no abrupt changes inits spending plans, including plans to repair installations no longer neededin the post-Cold War era. She said Energy Secretary James Watkins &quot;has movedas quickly as he can based on world events.&quot;;   But less senior officials saidthat even as President Bush and Watkins set the department on a new course,Energy Department engineers and managers simply are not able to respond asquickly.;   But Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., a persistent critic of the EnergyDepartment, said Tuesday that the agency had ample information to predict thedeclining need for maintaining such a large nuclear arsenal.;   &quot;The EnergyDepartment has been indulged for too long by a mind set that breeds waste,&quot;said Skaggs, a member of the House Appropriations Committee.;   A primeexample of the difficulty the Energy Department is having translating a newpolicy into savings is now occurring at the Rocky Flats Plant, an industrialfortress outside Denver. Rocky Flats has been shut for two years and isunlikely to function again as a manufacturer of plutonium triggers for nuclearweapons, administration and congressional experts say.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911218  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  378  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 18, 199100353117,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
