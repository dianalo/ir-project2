Mr. Watkins told reporters that over the next four years,the Energy Department plans to reduce the number of peoplemaking non-nuclear parts of weapons by about 4,000 to around5,000. The nuclear production work force of almost 30,000will shrink by several thousand over the next few years,although final decisions haven't been made.</LP><TEXT>   Previously, such steps weren't anticipated until after theturn of the century.   &quot;We can and we will reduce and streamline our nuclearweapons complex and make it more cost-effective, responsiveto changing times and less expensive to the taxpayer withoutabandoning our responsibility to support this nation'snational security,&quot; he said.   At the same time, the department will continue shiftingthe mission of its weapons plants to cleanup from production.Mr. Watkins said the department expects theenvironmental-restoration work force to nearly triple by 1995from just over 10,000 in 1989.   At the briefing, Mr. Watkins emphatically defended hisdecision last week to allow the restart of thetritium-producing K reactor at Savannah River, S.C. Amongother complaints, critics have argued the restart wasn'tneeded because the dismantling of weapons under internationalarms accords has left sufficient tritium for several years.   Mr. Watkins contended that it is important to demonstratethat the reactor is a reliable producer of tritium, aperishable gas used in nuclear warheads, in case it becomesneeded before a new tritium-producing reactor comes on linebetween 2005 and 2008. He said the department plans to putthe K reactor on a standby basis once its reliability isassured.   Discussing the new production reactor, Mr. Watkins saidthat the reduced need for tritium is allowing the departmentto take another look at the possibility of producing tritiumusing particle accelerator technology. Such technology wasn'tconsidered feasible under Cold War scenarios, when itappeared that the nation would need more tritium than it doesnow.   Noting that the nation's need for tritium has fallen morethan 50% since he became energy secretary in 1989, Mr.Watkins predicted that further shrinkage may be ahead. Thedepartment is preparing a proposed reconfiguration of itsentire weapons complex that it said could reduce the nuclearwork force to about one-half its current size in the next 10to 15 years. That study is due in October 1993; Mr. Watkinssaid yesterday that he is seeking to speed up that process.   The department plans a three-year phase-out of non-nuclearproduction at its Mound facility near Dayton, Ohio; itsPinellas plant in Clearwater, Fla.; and its Rocky Flats plantnear Denver. These activities will be transferred to a plantin Kansas City. Some non-nuclear production work willcontinue at the Pantex plant near Amarillo, Texas, and at theY-12 plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn.   The Pantex, Rocky Flats and Y-12 plants also performnuclear-production work. Environmentalists have called for aphasing out of all production work at Rocky Flats. Mr.Watkins said he is to report to Congress in February aboutwhether and when it might be feasible to end production atthat site.</TEXT></DOC>
