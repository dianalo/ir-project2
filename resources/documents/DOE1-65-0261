Althoughonly NO{sub 2} has been shown to affect human health, NO is also importantbecause it is a precursor of NO{sub 2}. At present the United Kingdom(UK) has emission standards for nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles,however, following the proposal of an NO{sub 2} Directive by the Commissionof the European Communities, it is likely that air-quality standardsfor NO{sub 2} will soon be applied. The introduction of such standardswill create a need for methods of modelling the dispersion of NO{sub2}. In this report, a Gaussian plume model is used to calculate long-periodaverage concentrations (averages over 6 and 12 months) of NOx in GreaterLondon. The procedure used to compile the emissions inventory for NOxis described. By means of an empirical relationship between NOx and NO{sub2}, the model results for NOx are used to estimate the correspondingaverage concentrations of NO{sub 2}. The model results for NOx and NO{sub2} are compared with observed values.</TEXT></DOC>
