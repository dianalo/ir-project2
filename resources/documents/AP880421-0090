Yeltsin, fired for criticizing the slow progress ofreforms in the Soviet Union, says he was correct in speaking out, aSoviet-published newspaper said.   In an interview in the May issue of the German-language MoskowNews, Yeltsin was quoted as saying: ``I belong to the ones who arewilling to take the rough road and have no fear of risks.''   Yeltsin was fired in November after a critical speech in Octoberbefore the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party.   The report describes visits by a Moscow correspondent toYeltsin's office, where he now works as the Soviet Union's DeputyChief of the State Constructions Committee, and to a hospital wherehe was admitted temporarily for heart problems.   Moscow News is based in Cologne and lists as its publisher theSoviet Union's Novosti news agency. It also lists the giant Grunerand Jahr publishing house of Hamburg as one of the West Germancompanies cooperating in the publication.   The May issue is the newspaper's first.   Yeltsin was quoted as saying he was surprised to hear that therewere printed copies of his October speech.   ``That must be a forgery,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying.``There was absolutely no (printed) text of my speech at theOctober plenum.''   But the interview, published with a photograph of Yeltsinwalking with his grandson, Boris Jr. in what appears to be a park,indicates he does not feel he was wrong in criticizing the Sovietsystem.   ``I spoke straightforwardly and said what I felt and thought wascorrect,'' the report quotes him as saying.   Yeltsin is quoted as explaining his reason for criticizing theslow-moving reforms without citing any names.   ``Someone had correctly said: Each must think independently, sothat later not all suddenly see the light all at once.''   The report says Yeltsin declined to repeat what he had said atthe Central Committee meeting in October because the committee hadnot formally decided to make the plenum remarks public.   ``I as a Central Committee member am not permitted to violatethis rule,'' the newspaper quoted Yeltsin as saying.   Lev N. Zaikov replaced Yeltsin as party chief of Moscow on Nov.11 in what some political observers said was a move by Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to appease opponents of his reformprogram for more openess in Soviet society.</TEXT></DOC>
