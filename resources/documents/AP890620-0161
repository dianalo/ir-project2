The three types of budget options described in the CongressionalBudget Office report would cost $11.3 billion to $18.4 billion from1990 to 1994, rather than the $31.1 billion proposed by PresidentBush for the same period.   ``If we spend billions on strategic defense that does not reallydefend us _ and siphon these billions from the budgets of fighterplanes, ships, tanks and personnel _ we may not make the countrymore secure,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., a member of the HouseArmed Services Committee who requested the report. ``For thisreason, the CBO report bears careful study.''   Bush cut spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative to $4.6billion for fiscal 1990, down from the $5.9 billion proposed byformer President Reagan.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has also said Bush will shift thefocus of Star Wars from deployment sometime in the 1990s to researchon a more advanced system known as ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' consistingof thousands of orbiting satellites.   Under the report's first option, the United States would beprotected against a Soviet breakthrough in technology or theKremlin's deployment of a strategic defense system.   Total spending would range from $11.3 billion to $14.5 billionand the option would be in compliance with the Anti-ballisticMissile Treaty, the report said.   The second option, estimated at a cost of about $17 billion,would enable the United States to defend parts of the countryagainst a limited nuclear attack caused by an accident. That optionmay comply with the ABM Treaty, the report said.   The third option, costing about $18.4 billion, would provide alarger strategic defense system that would protect land-basedmissiles housed in silos such as the MX and Midgetman.   The report estimates did not include the cost of procuring thesystem.</TEXT></DOC>
