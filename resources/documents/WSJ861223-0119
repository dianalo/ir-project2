Terms of the acquisition weren't disclosed, but First Nationwide said the closely held thrift, Clayton, Mo.-based St. Louis Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, has about $960 million in assets and 25 branches in Missouri. First Nationwide said the acquisition increases its total assets to more than $14 billion.    First Nationwide, the big thrift unit of Ford Motor Co., said it will receive &quot;monetary assistance&quot; from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for the transaction, but it wouldn't specify how much. The FSLIC said it would insure First Nationwide against certain liabilities and litigation that may arise as a result of the acquisition.    Anthony M. Frank, chairman of First Nationwide, said the FSLIC didn't assume any of the ailing thrift's nonperforming loans.    Mr. Frank said he doesn't yet have any acquisition targets in Illinois, Michigan or New Jersey. But he added, &quot;we'll start looking for friendly, healthy institutions.&quot; He said the transaction, &quot;gets a lot closer to living up to our name: First Nationwide Bank.&quot;    Yesterday's acquisition represents the second time First Nationwide has acted under a recent Federal Home Loan Bank Board regulation designed to help regulators find buyers for ailing thrifts. The new regulation can give thrifts that acquire ailing institutions the right to buy healthy thrifts in as many as three states outside of those in which they currently operate.    Last June, First Nationwide acquired two ailing Ohio thrifts -- State Savings andamp; Loan Co., South Euclid, and Citizens Home Savings andamp; Loan Co., Lorain -- in exchange for regulatory approval to expand its retail branch operation into Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado.    With the St. Louis Federal transaction, First Nationwide now has approval to operate in 11 states, including California, New York, Florida and Hawaii. </TEXT></DOC>
