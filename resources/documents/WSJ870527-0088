The rating concern also lowered its preliminary rating on $200 million of Borg-Warner shelf registrations to single-B from single-A-plus and removed the company from its CreditWatch list. Sandamp;P said the changes reflect increased financial risk and erosion of Borg's business position since its agreement this month to be taken private in a $3.76 billion leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company largely through debt and plan to pay the debt with funds generated by operations or asset sales. Sandamp;P said the buyout will raise Borg's debt level and probably prompt it to sell valuable assets. A Borg spokeswoman declined to comment on the Sandamp;P action.    ---   MERCANTILE BANCORP. -- Sandamp;P said it downgraded this St. Louis-based bank holding company's senior debt to single-A-minus from single-A-plus and its commercial paper to A-2 from A-1, affecting about $60 million of debt. The rating concern also downgraded its Mercantile Bank unit's certificates of deposit and issues supported by letters of credit to single-A-minus/A-2 from single-A-plus/A-1. Sandamp;P cited what it called substantial deterioration in the company's asset quality and profitability over the past five quarters. A spokesman for Mercantile said the company didn't disagree with the rating change.    ---   U.S. HOME CORP. -- Sandamp;P raised Houston-based U.S. Home's senior debt to single-B-plus from single-B and its subordinated debt to single-B-minus from triple-C-plus. About $150 million of debt is affected. The rating concern cited efforts to restore profitability and reduce financial and business risk. Sandamp;P said the home builder's current management has adopted more sound operating policies than its predecessors. A spokeswoman said the upgrading is evidence that the company's restructuring program is working. </TEXT></DOC>
