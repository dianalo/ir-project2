The proportioning valve further comprises a normally open additional valve      (14) arranged between the chamber (16) and the sensor (10), in order to      interrupt communication between the chamber (16) and the sensor (10)      during a braking operation. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a brake pressure proportioning valve of a      vehicle, subject to the load of the vehicle and controlled fluidically. </PAR><PAR>  Such brake pressure proportioning valves have been known to an average      person skilled in the art for a very long time. </PAR><PAR>  The document FR-A-2,600,957 describes, for example, a proportioning valve      according to the precharacterizing clause of the main claim. </PAR><PAR>  This proportioning valve is of the type comprising a piston sliding in a      stepped bore made in a body and carrying a normally open shutter arranged      between a source of fluid under pressure and an associated brake circuit,      the piston being movable counter to a spring under the effect of the      pressure of the fluid which tends to close the shutter, and comprising      furthermore a sealed control chamber connected to a load sensor. </PAR><PAR>  Such a proportioning valve has a considerable defect which can become      serious in some circumstances. In fact, it is known that such a      proportioning valve serves for modulating the pressure of the brake fluid      in the rear wheels as a function of the pressure of the source and of the      load of the vehicle, in order to prevent a locking of the rear wheels      during braking. Now during a braking operation, the rear wheels are, of      course, relieved of stress because a load transfer towards the front of      the vehicle takes place. Since the cutoff point of the proportioning valve      is determined as a result of the setting of the proportioning valve at the      factory, and since this setting depends on a chosen compromise taking a      particular load transfer into account or not, the braking of the vehicle      is therefore at its most efficient only in some highly specific instances. </PAR><PAR>  In fact, if the setting is provided for a medium load transfer, in the      event of rapid braking in which the load transfer is greater than the      medium load transfer provided, because of the response time inherent in      the fluidic connection between the load sensor and the control chamber of      the proportioning valve, the latter &quot;sees&quot; a higher load than that which      actually exists. The rear wheels are thus braked excessively in relation      to what they can support, and this can result in a locking of these rear      wheels. This perverse effect is amplified with the amount of braking      required and therefore runs completely counter to safety. </PAR><PAR>  If the setting is provided for a maximum load transfer, the opposite      occurs, and the rear wheels are not braked sufficiently in relation to      what they can support (except during rapid braking). The front wheels thus      ensure too high a proportion of the braking of the vehicle, thereby making      it necessary to oversize the corresponding brakes and possibly giving rise      to a locking of the front wheels in the event of poor adhesion. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The object of the present invention is to overcome this major disadvantage      arising as a result of a setting involving a compromise, by ensuring that      the proportioning valve memorizes the load of the vehicle before the load      transfer attributable to the braking operation. The cutoff point of the      proportioning valve can then be set at the factory independently of the      stress relief and is no longer the result of a compromise which can have a      perverse effect. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve this, according to the invention, the proportioning valve      comprises a normally open additional valve arranged between the chamber      and the sensor, in order to interrupt communication between the chamber      and the sensor during a braking operation. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the valve is controlled by the pressure of the fluid counter to      a spring. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, the valve is a solenoid valve interrupting communication      when the pressurization of the fluid of the source is commanded, or a      valve sensitive to the deceleration, the shutter of the latter      interrupting communication by inertia. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the      accompanying drawings in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 illustrates diagrammatically a proportioning valve according to a      first embodiment of the invention, </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2 and 3 each show a proportioning valve according to the diagram of      FIG. 1 diagrammatically in section, </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate two other embodiments of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  In the figures, identical elements bear the same references. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the figures, this proportioning valve comprises a fluidic      load sensor 10, for example arranged under the suspension spring of a rear      wheel. This sensor 10 usually consists of a sealed pocket filled with a      fluid, such as air, oil or water. This pocket is connected by means of a      conduit 12 to the sealed control chamber 16 of variable volume of the      proportioning valve. This chamber 16 controls the force on a pusher, on      which a stepped piston 18 sliding in a bore made in a body is capable of      coming to bear in order to change the cutoff point of the shutter which      the piston 18 carries. The source of fluid under pressure is connected to      the conduit 20, while the associated working circuit is connected to the      conduit 22. The functioning of such a proportioning valve is considered to      be well known to an average person skilled in the art and will not be      repeated in detail here. </PAR><PAR>  In brief, when the source of fluid under pressure is activated, the piston      18 moves in the direction of closing of the shutter which it carries, in      order to interrupt communication between the conduits 20 and 22. The      closing moment of this shutter is determined by the pressure of the source      of fluid under pressure and by the force on the pusher controlled by the      control chamber 16. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, the proportioning valve comprises an additional      valve 14 which is arranged in the conduit 12 and is normally open and      which interrupts communication between the load sensor 10 and the control      chamber 16 during a braking operation. Thus, during braking, the chamber      16 is as it was before the braking, whatever the load transfer detected by      the sensor 10. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows diagrammatically this additional valve 14 controlled by a      piston sensitive to the pressure of the source of fluid under pressure. A      conduit 24 therefore connects the conduit 20 to this valve 14, in order to      interrupt communication as soon as the pressure of the source reaches a      specific threshold. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate this embodiment in practical terms. In FIG. 2, the      conduit 24 is arranged outside the active part of the actual proportioning      valve. While in FIG. 3, the conduits 22 and 24 form only a single conduit,      the piston ensuring the closing of the shutter of the valve 14 then being      the conventional piston 18, to which is fixed a rod of telescopic type 26      making it possible to close the shutter of the valve 14, while at the same      time allowing the movement of the piston, even when the shutter is closed. </PAR><PAR>  The example illustrated in FIG. 2 makes it possible to use conventional      proportioning valves, without changes to these (except where the setting      is concerned) and to obtain the desired effect simply by adding one      component. The same applies to the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 4 and      5. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows diagrammatically a proportioning valve according to the      invention, but of which the additional valve is a solenoid valve      controlled, for example, by means of the stop light switch, with which      every vehicle is equipped in order to allow stop lights to light up. Thus,      as soon as the driver presses on the brake pedal, the chamber 16 is      isolated from the sensor 10 so as to obtain the desired effect before the      start of braking. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 5, the additional valve 14 is a valve sensitive to the      deceleration, its axis forming a particular angle with the horizontal.      Thus, the shutter consisting of the ball 28 is normally open at rest, and      as soon as the vehicle is decelerated the ball 28 closes the conduit 12 by      bearing on its seat simply as a result of inertia. An average person      skilled in the art will select this solution when he wishes to isolate the      chamber 16 after the start of braking. </PAR><PAR>  It will easily be appreciated that an average person skilled in the art can      make many modifications to the present invention, without departing from      the scope defined by the accompanying claims. For example, the additional      valve can have a third position, in which communication between the sensor      10 and the control chamber 16 will not be interrupted, but will simply be      reduced by means of a restriction, the load transfer information then      being sent to the proportioning valve with a calculated delay. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What we claim is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
