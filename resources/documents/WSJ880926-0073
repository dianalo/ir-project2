The U.S.-Canadian trade agreement is a step in that direction, and both presidential candidates endorse similar trade liberalization with Mexico. Vice President Bush has even advocated &quot;a new North American compact&quot; to open trade among Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.    The idea of greater trade liberalization in North America has long appealed to liberals and conservatives alike. Some even dream of the eventual creation of a North American common market. Right now such a prospect seems remote; yet there are powerful forces that could drive the North American nations in that direction.    Last year Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, both Republicans, introduced legislation to create a North American Free Trade Area. The bill hasn't gotten very far in the legislative pipeline, but it has generated some commentary. The conservative Heritage Foundation focused on the plan's benefit to the U.S.    &quot;The improved economic efficiency resulting from a North American Free Trade Area would surround the U.S. with a ring of prosperous countries better able to purchase U.S. goods and to provide the U.S. with valuable products. A North American FTA, moreover, would strengthen U.S. security&quot; by bolstering Mexico's economy and easing the risk of wrenching political change, according to the Heritage analysis.    But the advantages to our neighbors also are great -- freer access to the world's largest market and more capital investment and technology from the U.S. In many respects, the countries complement each other well.    Canada, a sophisticated industrial economy, is resource-rich and population-poor. With only seven people per square mile, it has one of the world's lowest population densities -- hardly a limitless market for new products. Mexico, a debt-ridden, developing country, desperately needs investment, technology, exports and other economic elixirs to spur growth. But it has an abundance of oil and of people. Its population is growing rapidly and the number of potential new workers is rising much faster than the number of jobs the economy is generating.    The U.S. needs resources, and, increasingly, it needs workers. Because of a sharp decline in the birth rate that started in the late 1960s, the U.S. work force will grow by about 1% a year in the 1990s, down sharply from the 2.5% annual rate in the last 1970s. And, of course, the U.S. needs more markets for its exports.    Yet further integration of the North American market will be a drawn-out, delicate process. Although the U.S. and Canada already are the world's largest trading partners, the new trade agreement, which calls for the removal of most trade barriers between them over the next 10 years, has provoked fears in Canada about loss of economic and cultural sovereignty.    Mexico is even more afraid of potential U.S. economic and cultural domination. And the U.S. worries about an influx of illegal immigrants from Mexico. Unlike Europe, the North American nations are a long way from creating a common market that allows goods, services, capital and people to move across borders without restriction.    Assuming that the Canadian Senate approves the new trade agreement with the U.S., the key to further integration of the North American market will be relations between the U.S. and Mexico. After six years of debt crisis and austerity, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's newly-elected president, must work fast to improve economic conditions and bolster his political base.    &quot;It may be that the moment has been reached in which Mexico's leaders believe that the country has no choice but to tie its economic fortunes even more closely to those of the U.S. -- at least for the immediate future,&quot; says Cathryn Thorup, the director of the U.S.-Mexico Project at the Overseas Development Council. &quot;Whether this will create greater bilateral conflict or enhance cooperation over the long run is impossible to judge,&quot; she adds.    Too often, she points out, U.S.-Mexican relations have dealt with problems -- such as drugs and debt -- rather than opportunities. Mr. Salinas appears to be committed to a course the U.S. supports -- opening the Mexican economy to competition and allowing more foreign investment. But after his close election, it's not clear whether he has the power to proceed. One key may be the amount of help he gets from the U.S., particularly in Mexico's efforts to manage its debt service burden.    The fact that both Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis advocate liberalizing trade with Mexico doesn't mean it will happen. &quot;For historical and economic reasons, that will present challenges,&quot; Mr. Dukakis concedes. But there's a powerful incentive for success; the population of North America is 355 million, 10% more than the European Community, and the fastest growing country in the North American market is Mexico.    ---                 The North American Market -                POPULATION     ANNUAL RATE     PER CAPITA               (in millions)   OF INCREASE     GNP (1986)    Canada          26.1          0.7%           $14,100    Mexico          83.5          2.4              1,850    U.S.           246.1          0.7             17,500   Source: Population Reference Bureau, Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
