The machines will start at $2.2 million, a price that putsthem in competition with entry-level technology from Japaneserival Fujitsu Ltd. as well as intensive-computing devicesfrom such domestic competitors as International BusinessMachines Corp., based in Armonk, N.Y., and Convex ComputerCorp., based in Richardson, Texas.</LP><TEXT>   Called the Y-MP2E, the latest Cray supercomputers are adownward extension of the company's primary line of Y-MPs(for multiprocessor). Until now, the cheapest Y cost $5million while the eight-processor version -- the world'slargest -- cost nearly $23 million.   The new machines contain the same processing and memorytechnology, and run at the same six nanosecond (billionths ofa second) cycle speed, as other members of the Y family. Butthe small versions won't need the cumbersome cooling&quot;plumbing&quot; its larger siblings require. Instead, they can beeither air-cooled or water-cooled, allowing them to fit intocurrent computer-room environments.   Four years ago, Minneapolis-based Cray rolled out a $2.5million machine called the X-MP/14se, which the company thendescribed as a &quot;starter set.&quot; Now discontinued, it wasintended to offer supercomputing to potential users whoeither couldn't afford or didn't need full-sized machines.But the one-processor 14se was limited in its capabilities,and couldn't connect to large data-storage devices.   Those limitations as well as the development of a newgeneration of technology led to that machine's demise.   The 2E also replaces earlier one-processor andtwo-processor Y machines, which didn't offer air cooling andwhich cost twice as much. Moreover, the new machines offerlarger memories than the previous models.   Cray said it is positioning the new small machines for twotypes of customers -- those looking for an entry intosupercomputing and those current users with computingproblems too small for their current supercomputers but toocomplex for easy solution elsewhere. Thus, the latter will beable to &quot;download&quot; those discrete problems to the small Y.   Supercomputers typically are used to tackle problems toocomplex for regular mainframe machines; often the problemsare sophisticated mathematical models used to design suchproducts as automobiles, airplanes and drugs, or simulationsof such events as a nuclear explosion.   Although the company says it made two-thirds of theworld's current supercomputer systems, it has been facingincreasing competition at the low end of the market,particularly as it fights for more commercial customers. Thenew line extension seeks to &quot;offer customers realsupercomputer power at affordable prices,&quot; said MarceloGumucio, Cray's president.   Acknowledging what he called supercomputing's changinglandscape, Cray's chairman and chief executive officer, JohnA. Rollwagen, said the company was responding to theincreasing popularity of computer networks while continuing&quot;aggressive development at the high end of the performancespectrum.&quot;   Mr. Gumucio said shipments of the 2E would begin withinthree or four months but declined to estimate how many thecompany was projecting to sell or lease in the next year.   Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. analyst Barry Willman estimatesthat the new machine will contribute only marginally torevenue this year but forecasts about 15 systems beingshipped next year. Gary Smaby, a Minneapolis-based analystwho heads his own company, said he expects margins on the newproducts to be &quot;modestly lower&quot; than on larger Cray machines.   Cray stock closed at $48.75, up 75 cents, in compositetrading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
