Whittle Communications, a Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company,said Sunday the subscriptions during the first eight weeks ofactive recruitment of schools puts the project halfway toward itsgoal of having 1,000 schools equipped to receive the show at launchin March 1990.   It now expects to have 1,000 schools signed up by the end ofthis year.   The Channel One project has come under fierce attack by nationaleducational groups, state officials in California and New York andothers who object to giving advertisers a platform for pitchingproducts to students in the classroom.   Channel One plans to send a 12-minute news show geared towardstudents to participating schools every weekday. Each show willcontain two minutes of paid advertising. In exchange for therunning the show, schools get about $50,000 each in televisionmonitors, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes.   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications, saidhis salesmen have approached about 1,290 school districtsrepresenting 3,855 schools in 24 states so far. He said 10 percentof the districts have rejected the offer, schools in 238 districtshave signed up and talks continue in the rest.   He said he expects to have no trouble meeting the longer-termgoal of having 7,000 to 8,000 schools participating in the programby the end of 1990.   ``This documents what we thought: that local educators wouldview this very differently than national ones,'' he said. ``Somecritics are going to be very surprised.''   Installation of equipment is expected to begin in January.   Whittle has previously said it had signed contracts withadvertisers who have bought 56 percent of the available commercialtime on Channel One for the first year of programming.</TEXT></DOC>
