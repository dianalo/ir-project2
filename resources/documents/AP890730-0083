Hundreds of people watched from shore as the ship, pushed bytugboats, entered the bay and rounded North Island, passingwaterfront hotels and Navy warships. Harbor seals stared from atopbuoys.   ``It's a wounded dinosaur,'' said Rick Nadeau of Greenpeace, theenvironmental group, which sent boats out to check for oil in thetanker's wake.   Families with cameras jockeyed for the best shooting positionswith news photographers and television cameramen.   Joggers and bicyclists joined the crowd that stretched about 500feet along the shore to marvel at the high-riding vessel inscribedwith the name Exxon in bright red letters.   Several people waved branches with feathers attached _ a silentprotest on behalf of the birds killed in Alaska's Prince WilliamSound when the Exxon Valdez hit a reef and spilled 11 milliongallons of oil on March 24.   A number of protesters hoisted signs that read: ``No OilSpilling, No Ocean Killing'' and ``End of the Exxploitation.''   The strains of John Lennon's song, ``Imagine,'' were heard abovethe drone of a Coast Guard helicopter hovering over the tanker.   And as the tanker glided under the Coronado Bridge, the crowdtook on a carnival atmosphere. Vendors hawked $7 T-shirts that read``American Wilderness: Love it or Leave it Alone'' and ``OilProfit$ Can't Buy Back the Environment.''   The tugs pushed the ship to a pier at the National Steel andShipbuilding Co. for a nine-month, $25 million repair job, ending a2,500-mile voyage from Alaska's and the nation's worst oil spill.   Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg said no oil discharges werespotted. At the pier, the tanker was encircled by a floating orangecontainment boom.   ``It ended today very quietly and we were pleased it endedquietly,'' Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi toldreporters at the dock.   Iarossi again denied the ship was the source of at least threeoil slicks off the coast, as charged by state Fish and GameDepartment officials.   ``I'm denying the Valdez spewed oil,'' he said. ``There was nooil on that ship. People are losing sight of that fact.''   He disclosed that Exxon may try to remove the stigma of thespill from the ship by changing its name.   ``Rechristening wouldn't be in order, but we are consideringwhether we should start a new career for the vessel with a newname,'' he said.   The 987-foot tanker was allowed in as far as the pilot's buoyoutside the harbor at 11 p.m. Saturday. After inspection, the portcaptain, Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro, gave final clearance.   The ship reached San Diego three weeks ago but was turned awayas a pollution risk and had to stay about 50 miles offshore whileExxon negotiated with five state agencies for permission to enterCalifornia waters.   During that time, divers cut away dangling steel plates thatripped from the ship's hull en route from Alaska. That wasnecessary so the tanker could navigate shallow sections of the bay.   Entering the harbor, the ship rode high with the top of therudder and propellers exposed.   Coast Guard and Harbor Patrol boats guarded a security zonearound the tanker. Ships with pollution containment and salvageequipment followed.   Among dozens of surrounding pleasure boats were Greenpeace boatswith crews watching for signs of oil in the wake.   ``Oil Spills Kill,'' said a banner with a skull and crossboneson one boat. ``Change The Course, Steer Toward Sane Energy,'' saidanother.   Greenpeace activist Kelly Quirke said they were not protestingthe ship's arrival, but what it represents.   ``It represents a fossil-fuel energy policy that is not onlydestroying the ocean but the atmosphere,'' Quirke said.   The repair job stirred excitement at the shipyard where thetanker was built in 1986. Shipyard managers expect to add 300people and boost the workforce to 3,000. Sixty laid-off workerswere to be recalled immediately, said Peter Zschiesche, arepresentative of the machinists' union.   ``They've been calling me every day wanting to know, `When isthe ship coming in? When can we go back to work?''' he said.   Under Exxon's agreement with the state, the Valdez had to beleak-free for the 24-hour period before entry and accompanied by apollution response vessel.   Exxon put up $20 million in a bond and a trust account to insureits performance and cover cleanup costs in the event of a spill inlocal waters.</TEXT></DOC>
