Swarns (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MCIC </CO><IN> ERN TEL </IN><TEXT>   MCI Communications Corp. said second-quarter net income surged to $73 million from $8 million a year earlier, reflecting a much wider revenue base and greatly improved operating margins.    The results took Wall Street by surprise, triggering a jump in stock price and prompting many analysts to boost their earnings forecasts for 1988 at least 10 cents a share.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI climbed $1.25 a share to close at $17.375 in active trading. Volume of about 5.3 million shares was by far the heaviest in Nasdaq trading yesterday.    The Washington-based telecommunications company's per-share rose to 25 cents from three cents a year earlier. Revenue rose 28% to $1.22 billion from $952 million.    Earnings in the latest quarter included a tax credit of $15 million for tax-loss carry-forwards and a pretax gain of $9 million on the company's previously reported settlement of antitrust litigation with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., MCI's giant rival in the long-distance business.    Daniel F. Akerson, chief financial officer, attributed the improvement to &quot;superlative revenue growth,&quot; particularly in 800-service, international services and commercial accounts. He predicted continued rapid growth &quot;in the next couple of years&quot; as the company reaches more markets &quot;that have been the sole domain of ATandamp;T.&quot;    Mr. Akerson said large business accounts contributed about 15% of revenue, compared with 7% in the year-earlier quarter. In the latest quarter, for example, MCI won contracts from Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Baxter Healthcare Corp. and the Social Security Administration.    Cost-containment measures and decreased capital spending also contributed to higher earnings. Capital spending has declined from a high of $1.1 billion in 1986, when MCI was upgrading and expanding its long-distance network, to $750 million this year.    &quot;The company's on a roll,&quot; said Edward Greenberg, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who had expected MCI to earn only about 17 cents a share for the second quarter. &quot;I didn't expect (the earnings) to be this strong,&quot; he said.    Mr. Greenberg expressed the view of many industry analysts who now believe they have underestimated MCI's growing financial strength. Moreover, MCI's decision last week to buy back International Business Machine Corp.'s 16% stake in the company is considered a further indication of that strength.    Gerald Levine, a partner at New York money manager Weiss, Peck andamp; Greer, said the buy-back, coupled with MCI's &quot;extraordinary business momentum,&quot; creates an odd situation where &quot;every analyst's estimate on the Street is too low.&quot;    For example, analysts at Morgan Stanley Group, PaineWebber Inc., and Nomura Securities Co. all have raised their 1988 estimates twice in the past week. Morgan Stanley and Nomura Securities boosted their estimates to about 80 cents from about 75 cents after the buy-back announcement, and again yesterday to the range of 90 cents to a $1 a share.    Jack Grubman, an analyst for PaineWebber who intends to raise his 1988 estimate significantly from 90 cents a share, also said he anticipates a further rise in MCI's stock price within the next six to 12 months. </TEXT></DOC>
