 The twoencompassing themes are: Cooperative processing and Cooperative applicationdevelopment.andM;Cooperative processing is the technical side of the picture, where severaltrends are emerging:andM;* Distributed database integration is the strategic weapon for users to getthe most value out of their investment dollars.andP;  Data sharing across systemswill be a reality through advancements in hardware and software.andM;* PCs will be the tools for applications development and use.andP;  Minis andmainframes will become the data repository for mission-critical systems.andM;* SQL has already emerged as the database language that will facilitate theconnection.andP;  The bus will make data sharing possible.andM;* Database engines will emerge as hardware devices that provide performance.andO;The database engine, in large part, will be submerged into the CPU andoperating system.andM;* Finally, front-end tools that can access database engines will be thewinners in the 1990s.andM;By data sharing, do you mean that data is available from other systems?andM;It'll be much more extensive than that.andP;  Not only will corporate data beavailable to individual users, other users' private data will also beavailable.andM;Accompanying cooperative processing will be cooperative applicationdevelopment, the organizational aspect of the revolution.andP;  The role of userand data processing professionals will merge.andM;More and more development work will be the responsibility of the departmentalusers.andP;  As some of the applications increase in usefulness, they will betransferred to data processing (DP) professionals to upgrade control andsecurity.andP;  Thus, systems will be 'cooperatively' developed.andP;  Vendors mustprovide products that meet the full spectrum of needs for power anduser-friendless.andM;In the era of cooperative application development, DP professionals must moveaway from being carpenters and move toward being architects, consultants, andcontrollers.andP;  The role of data administration will become more and moreimportant.andM;Data with mission critical significance will reside in corporate datarepositories.andP;  Application logic will be separate from data managementprocedures.andP;  Data access will be available to other users as authorized bytheir rightful owners.andM;Powerful CASE tools will be available to help end users and DP professionalsdevelop applications.andP;  For example, an artificial intelligence system canhelp users design databases by suggesting normalized data structures.andO;Systems will become increasingly visual.andM;How are you positioning DataEase International, Inc. in thispost-revolutionary environment?andM;DataEase is and will be a front-end products company.andP;  In order for thiscooperative environment to work, tools must be as powerful and user-friendlyas [DataEase's] 4GL tools.andP;  In the current technology there's a schism; usersmay choose non-procedural tools that are easy to use but run out of gasquickly.andP;  Data processing professionals will use a procedural programminglanguage that has power, but which will be very intimidating to users.andM;DataEase, our backbone product, is a forerunner of the types of products thatwill be available in the 1990s.andP;  The product is definitely non-procedural.andM;Our add-on products present data to users in a more intuitive way than thetraditional textual mode.andP;  DataEase Imag-In allows users to scan, store,manipulate and retrieve images as files.andP;  DataEase CrossView lets usersdiscover patterns on data using multi-dimensional spreadsheets or arrays.andM;We also have products that access data from the mainframe.andP;  DataEase Connectwill bring data from IBM mainframes to the PC.andP;  Already announced is DataEaseSQL, a front-end product that interfaces with OS/2 EE and many mainframedatabases.andM;Is that your complete list?andM;We're currently evaluating and planning to support other servers.andM;You mention that very powerful development tools are available for users.andP;  Doyou mean DataEase Developer?andM;The Developer supports the later stages of the System Life Cycle bygenerating application documentation automatically.andP;  DataEase sees a systemgoing through four stages: 1) Pre-implementation, where the requirements aregathered; 2) Implementation, where the system is developed; 3) Migration toproduction; and 4) Managing evolution.andM;So you see that we have products that support only stages 2 and 3.andP;  The totalsystem life cycle is important, and DataEase is committed to offer solutionsfor all stages.andM;How do you think users will benefit from your philosophy?andM;Productivity is the major benefit.andP;  With productivity you get maximum returnfor your dollar.andP;  Quick and effective systems and user satisfaction are someother benefits.andM;Do you see your products as end users tools?andM;Actually, we built the system with sufficient power to satisfy DPprofessionals.andP;  However, end users also find our product very useful.andP;  As aresult, we're marketing to them as well.andM;Going back to DataEase, what's the difference between DQL and SQL?andM;SQL is the database sub-language.andP;  DQL is more than SQL, although there aresome overlapping functions.andP;  Because we see SQL as the dominant databaselanguage of the 1990s, we're committed to migrating true database functionsto SQL.andP;  DQL will be an application development tool.andM;Is SQL implemented on the server only, and what do you see as itsramifications?andM;No, SQL will be available as a query language to our users on workstations.andO;By providing SQL on workstations, users proficient in SQL can submit queriesdirectly to the database engine, while other users can access data by usingDQL, our more friendly and comprehensive language.andP;  DQL transparentlytranslates the commands into SQL for our users.andM;DataEase is the No.andP;  2 micro database management product, yet very few peoplehave heard of it.andP;  Why is that?andM;A large part of our sales is outside of the U.S.; roughly 40 percent is inEurope.andP;  Also, we've concentrated on selling the product to largeorganizations.andP;  Finally, we haven't been very aggressive in advertising ourproduct.andM;Is your client base primarily corporate?andM;We have been, but we're now interested in reaching mid-size and smallerclients.andP;  We want to work aggressively with developers and resellers.andM;We're launching a &quot;Custom Application Development&quot; campaign where we offer toprototype a client's application free.andP;  In that effort we're recruiting alarge number of consultants.andM;What do you see your company doing in 1989 and beyond?andM;We're in the middle of a revolution.andP;  People are using PCs differently.andO;DataEase hopes to push the edge of technology further by providing tools andsolutions that offer user friendliness, data sharing, and--most ofall--productivity.andM;Julie Finkelstein in Senior Consultant at Performance Computing, Inc.andP;  Shehas over 15 years of database management and consulting experience, and aspecial interest in personal computing.andP;  Currently, she is in the process ofestablishing a midwest SQL users group.andP;
