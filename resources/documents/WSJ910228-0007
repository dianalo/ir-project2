That is something for investors to keep in mind as theypour billions of dollars a week into the funds.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Probably the last thing you want to think about is yourmoney fund,&quot; says John Markese, research director for theAmerican Association of Individual Investors, based inChicago. &quot;You should think about it.&quot;   Money funds typically are considered safe havens duringuncertain times. They are structured so the net asset valueremains at $1 per share and only the yield varies, so aninvestor's principal isn't at risk. They also are totallyliquid, meaning that an investor can withdraw funds at anytime.   Those features continue to make money fundsextraordinarily appealing to many people. Investors haveadded about $50 billion to money funds just since the startof the year, even though yields have fallen a percentagepoint or more and the stock market has rallied. Today, thereare more than 450 taxable money funds with assets of wellover $450 billion.   But there are variations in yields, management fees,portfolios and services, among other things, that make somefunds more attractive than others to various investors.Here's a look at some of the key differences:                                                                                                          YIELD. Many investors choose money funds because yieldsare higher than on comparable short-term investments. Indeed,the average seven-day compound yield on taxable money fundsin the latest week, 6.49%, compares with an average 5.84% onbank money-market accounts and 6.08% on three-month bankcertificates of deposit, and 6.19% on three-month Treasurybills sold at the latest auction. (Compound yields assumereinvestment of dividends.)   But averages don't tell the whole story. The highestyielding taxable money fund last week, according toIBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, was American PerformanceCash Management, with a seven-day compound yield of 7.53%.The seven-day compound yield of the lowest-yielding fund,Declaration Cash Account, was 4.79%.   It is important to know what is behind the yields, too. Anumber of funds are waiving all or part of their managementfees, which has the effect of boosting yield. Some do it as amatter of policy, to keep yields competitive; others do itwhen the fund is new to attract investors. Eight of thetop-10 funds last week were waiving fees, including AmericanPerformance Cash.   When the waivers are lifted, yields can drop, althoughfunds usually phase in fees gradually. Fidelity Spartan MoneyMarket Fund, for instance, which currently charges fees equalto 0.35% of assets and has promised not to top 0.45% through1995, began by charging 0.05% in the spring of 1989. Theaverage for all money funds, according to Donoghue's is0.65%.                                                                                                          INVESTMENTS. Some funds invest exclusively in Treasurybills or Treasurys and government agency securities, othershave almost all their assets in commercial paper (short-termcorporate IOUs). Many funds also buy bank certificates ofdeposit, including some dollar-denominated CDs issued by U.S.banks overseas (Eurodollar CDs) or by foreign banks in theU.S. (Yankeedollar CDs). &quot;There's a hierarchy of risk as youmove from U.S. Treasurys to agencies to commercial paper toYankeedollar CDs,&quot; says Mr. Markese of AAII.   About 47% of total taxable money fund assets is currentlyinvested in commercial paper, down from nearly 52% last fall.A few recent defaults by commercial paper issuers forcedmutual fund companies to bail out funds holding the paper toavoid losses to investors. Just this month, the Securitiesand Exchange Commission approved new rules limiting moneyfunds' investments in less than top-rated commercial paper to5% of the total portfolio.   Some people favor funds that invest exclusively inTreasurys, or in Treasurys and government agency paper,because of the added margin of safety. The trade-off is thatthat these investors usually have to accept a lower yield.The average sevenday compound yield on government-only funds,was 6.25%, according to Donoghue's. But funds that investonly in Treasurys are exempt from state and local incometaxes in most states, which effectively boosts their yield.                                                                                                          AVERAGE MATURITY. Longer maturities enable a fund to holdonto relatively high yields when interest rates are falling,while shorter maturities permit them to grab higher yieldsquickly when rates are rising. For all taxable funds, averagematurity of their investments is now 54 days -- just a dayshort of the longest it has been in more than a decade.                                                                                                          SERVICES. The services a fund offers can make a bigdifference to some investors. Some funds have a minimuminitial investment of $500, others are as high as $20,000.Some have a minimum amount on checks, others don't. Somefunds have a per-check charge, too.   Even geography can be a factor. Investors who send checksby mail may want to take into account how long it will take.   Financial professionals say it behooves an investor toread a fund's prospectus and annual report. Besidesinformation about investments and services, these documentsalso provide information about such things as procedures forpurchases and redemptions and when a fund credits income.   Finally, there is nothing that says one money fund has tomeet all of your needs, especially if you have a lot of moneyto invest. &quot;We advise people to have multiple money funds,&quot;says A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper AnalyticalServices, a mutual fund research firm. &quot;J.P. Morgan used tosay you can either eat well or sleep well, but most peoplewant to have both.&quot;   ---               How Some Money Funds Differ                                                                                                                                         PORTFOLIO                             --------------------- ASSETS                      AVERAGE            PCT (In               EXPENSE   MATURITY  PCT  COMMERCIAL  PCT millions) YIELD*  RATIO     (days)    TREAS   PAPER    CDS                                                                                                        GW Sierra Global Income $   61.5   7.42%    0.25%**    75       ---      70      6                                                                                                        Vanguard MMR Prime 14,103.5   7.16     0.30       49       ---      67     26                                                                                                        Dreyfus Liquid Assets  7,505.5   6.67     0.65       50       ---      72     28                                                                                                        T.
