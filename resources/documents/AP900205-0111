In a speech one environmentalist called a ``grossdisappointment,'' Bush said he is convening a meeting at the WhiteHouse this spring of top environmentalists, economists andecologists to grapple with the issue.   He promised U.S. support for ``aggressive and thoughtfulaction'' to solve problems caused by global warming. But he soundeda note of caution against scientists and environmentalists whobelieve the warming of the Earth's atmosphere is already seriousenough to warrant severe anti-pollution controls.   ``Wherever possible we believe that market mechanism should beapplied and that our policies must be consistent with economicgrowth and free market principles in all countries,'' Bush said inhis address before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, aUnited Nations-sponsored group opening a three-day meeting atGeorgetown University.   Environmentalists from the United States and Europe were quickto criticize Bush for not making a clear commitment for immediateaction aimed at dealing with global warming.   ``It was a gross disappointment. There was more talk in thespeech about economics than about the environment,'' said DanielBecker of the Sierra Club.   Stewart Boyle of the Association for the Conservation of Energyin Great Britain said Bush's remarks demonstrated ``a leadershipcrisis'' on the global warming issue at the White House. ``Aboutthe only thing we can say about it is he turned up'' at theconference, said Boyle.   The cross-section of environmentalists are attending theconference as observers. They said they would have liked to haveseen Bush present specific U.S. commitments toward energyconservation and specific goals on reductions in carbon dioxidepollution, which is the major contributor to global warming.   Global warming is the gradual increase in the Earth'stemperature due to buildup of heat-trapping gases emitted into theatmosphere by burning oil and gas.   In his speech, Bush said, ``We all know that human activitiesare changing the atmosphere in unexpected and in unprecedentedways.''   He said ``some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns forpolitical positioning.''   ``Where politics and opinion have outpaced the science, we areaccelerating our support of the technology to bridge that gap,''Bush said.   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu reportedly orderedchanges in the text to mute U.S. concerns about global warming.Sununu acknowledged Sunday he made some changes, but said they weresimply to make the speech ``reflective'' of administration policy.   Sununu also criticized ``faceless'' environmental bureaucrats hesaid want to force Americans to give up their cars.   ``If we hope to promote environmental protection and growtharound the world it will be important not to work in conflict, butwith our industrial sectors,'' Bush told the scientists.   ``You're called upon to deliver recommendations which strike adifficult and yet critical international bargain, a convergencebetween global environmental policies and global economic policies,a bargain where both perspectives benefit and neither iscompromised,'' Bush told the scientists.   The speech drew restrained applause from several hundreddelegates.   ``There was no step forward in his speech,'' remarked BrooksYeager of the National Audubon Society.   Later, at the White House, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater asserted scientists disagree on the issue of globalwarming and ``the people who think this is a problem that needs tobe solved today don't understand it. They're wrong.''   Fitzwater was asked if Bush had changed his position since the1988 presidential campaign.   During the campaign, Bush said he would convene a globalconference on the environment in his first year in office on globalwarming and other environmental problems, and that it was time toact on these problems.   ``If that's true, then he has changed his view. I don't know ifhe said those words during the campaign, but if so, he's changedhis mind,'' Fitzwater said.   In a major speech on enviornmental policy in Michigan on Aug.31, 1988, Bush said that ``those who think we're powerless to doanything about the `greenhouse effect' are forgetting abvout the`White House effect.' As president, I intend to do something aboutit.''   Bush also greeted the president-elect of Uruguay, Luis AlbertoLacalle. He also met with a delegation of 24 U.S. Jewish leaders,who urged him to prod Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev tospeak out against rising anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.   Sununu, speaking on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''said Sunday the speech would focus ``on our commitment to deal withthe international environmental issues in such a way that we don'tend up not being able to use our coal, oil and natural gasresources.''   ``There's a little tendency by some of the faceless bureaucratson the environmental side to try to create a policy in this countrythat cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas,'' said Sununu,a nuclear engineer by training.   ``I don't think that's what this country wants. I don't thinkAmerica wants not to be able to use their automobiles,'' said theformer governor of New Hampshire, who has clashed withEnvironmental Protection Agency head William K. Reilly on this andother issues.   White House officials said the president is seeking tounderscore environmental steps he is taking, including:   _A proposal to spend $1 billion in fiscal year 1991, an increaseof 57 percent, for global change research.   _Plans to spend $175 million to plant 1 billion trees annuallyfor a decade.   _Major revisions in the Clean Air Act to attack smog and otherpollution, still pending in Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
