The court overturned a federal magistrate's dismissal in April 1987 of a civil suit filed against American Home by Zenith Laboratories Inc., a Ramsey, N.J., generic-drug maker, and by a generic-drug makers' trade association. Zenith and the trade group had accused American Home's Ayerst Laboratories unit of trying to frighten pharmacists out of using a generic version of Ayerst's Inderal, a heart drug.    The magistrate said claims by Zenith Laboratories and the trade group lacked standing under U.S. antitrust laws and the Lanham Act, a federal law that bars companies from making false and misleading statements about another company. Milton Bass, a New York attorney for Zenith, asserted that the appeals court's ruling will spur civil suits against other drug companies that have &quot;conducted campaigns to frighten doctors and others not to use generic drugs.&quot; Mr. Bass also represents the trade group, the National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.    American Home declined to comment.    The suit, which sought damages and costs totaling $50 million, charged that Ayerst and a newsletter to pharmacists had illegally warned druggists that they might be liable for damages if they filled prescriptions for certain patients with a generic copy of Inderal. The suit noted that all 50 states have laws under which pharmacists can substitute generics for brandname drugs unless a doctor orders otherwise. Ayerst's warning to druggists and Zenith's suit is one of many marketing and legal battles that continue to be fought between big drug makers and the manufacturers of less expensive generic versions of the brand-name drugs.    Mr. Bass said he expects to go back to federal district court in Manhattan and seek damages. But first, he said, &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if American Home took this {the appeals court's decision} to the Supreme Court.&quot;    In 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration called American Home's warning to pharmacists &quot;false and misleading&quot; and said it constituted &quot;an attempt to intimidate pharmacists to always dispense Inderal.&quot;    Zenith Laboratories filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in May. The company has had financial problems for several years and in the first quarter of this year reported a loss of $6.1 million and a 44% drop in sales to $7 million from the year-earlier period. </TEXT></DOC>
