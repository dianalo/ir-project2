According to Hungarian television, majority agreement was reachedon a constitutional reform, establishment of a constitutional court,the functioning of political parties and a draft electoral law.   Negotiators also agreed on a reform of the penal code and anamendment to the law on criminal procedure.   The items of legislation will be submitted to Parliament, whichconvenes on Sept. 26.   Four opposition groups _ the League of Free Democrats, the Leagueof Young Democrats, the League of Independent Democratic TradeUnions and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party _ did not sign theagreement, but said they won't stand in the way of Parliament'sworking on the bills.   The agreement specified that political bargaining would continueon issues not resolved.   According to the state news agency MTI, these include thetechnical aspects of electing the president of the republic; a newlaw on information; issues related to transforming the workers'militia, now a paramilitary group, and ruling out violent means tosolve political issues.   In addition to the communists and opposition groups, the talkswere attended by social organizations, including the official tradeunions.   In a major concession announced earlier, the Hungarian SocialistWorkers Party, or the Communist Party, agreed to give $36 million tothe government by the end of the year to be used to financeopposition political parties.   MTI said agreement was reached that the president will be chosenby referendum this year, but should be selected by Parliament oncefree elections have been held.   After the constitutional amendment is enacted, the currentPresidential Council will be dissolved and its duties assumed by thespeaker of Parliament until a new president is elected. The11-member council is empowered to exercise the functions ofParliament when Parliament is not in session.   A major opposition demand was disbanding the workers' militia, anorganization set up in 1957 by the communist party to safeguard itsrule.   The communists tried to defuse the issue on Monday by offering toslash the 60,000-member militia's strength by a third and put itunder Defense Ministry supervision, but this apparently was notenough.</TEXT></DOC>
