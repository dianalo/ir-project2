In an unsually strong statement broadcast by Radio Soleil churchradio, the bishops addressed ``a solemn appeal to all Haitians totake seriously this moment which, led according to the principlesof the Gospel and the social teachings of the church, can lead to averitable liberation.''   The bishops said the people wanted a change in the system when,through massive demonstrations, they forced Jean-Claude Duvalier toflee to France in February 1986, ending his family's 29-yeardictatorship.   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy then became de facto ruler of Haiti untilSept. 17, when he was ousted by enlisted men of the PresidentialGuard and replaced by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, a longtime Duvaliercollaborator.   Much of the recent violence in Haiti targeting civilianopponents of Namphy's authoritarian rule was carried out by thugswho at one time belonged to the Tonton Macoutes, the dreadedprivate militia of the Duvalier regime.   The rebels have ousted military commanders who tolerated theviolence and there have been reprisal killings of people associatedwith the Macoutes.   In their statement, the bishops called for ``a policy ofelimination of Macoutism and a plan for the salvage of the nation.''   ``This policy entails the general disarming of Macoutes and theexclusion from the civil service of all those who in one way oranother actively contributed to the consolidation and perpetuationof the dictatorial system during the last 30 years,'' the bishopssaid.   It was not immediately clear whether the bishops were includingAvril in their refernce to Duvalier collaborators. Avril was afinancial adviser and close friend of Duvalier and also servedunder the dictator's father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.   The bishops called for the creation of an impartial judiciaryand urged unspecified ``international organizations'' to increaseassistance to this impoverished Caribbean nation.   The United States, France and Canada cut off aid after thugsattacked and killed at least 34 voters in thwarting November 1987balloting that would have been Haiti's first free elections in 30years.   The church has always exerted a strong influence over theHaitian populace, which is 90 percent Roman Catholic and was acrucial supporter of the demonstrations that led to the end ofDuvalier rule.   Laennec Hurbon, a sociologist and author of books on Haitianculture, called the bishops' statement ``a break with the pastpolicies of the church.''   Hurbon, who is affiliated with the National Science ResearchCenter in Paris, said the bishops recognized that nationalreconciliation is not possible unlces Macoutism is eradicated.   Some 3,000 Roman Catholics, meanwhile, spilled out of theauditorium of the St. Gerard Church on Sunday for a service tomourn victims of a Sept. 11 massacre at the nearby St. Jean BoscoChurch and to celebrate the military uprising.   The Rev. Antonio Sele referred in a sermon to the rank-and-filetroops who led the coup as ``our soldiers'' and denounced theslaughter that left 13 people dead and more than 70 wounded at St.Jean Bosco's.   After the Mass, about 1,500 people, including 150 survivors ofthe massacre, marched more than seven miles to a suburban churchschool, where they were greeted by the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,pastor of St. Jean Bosco's.   It was Aristide's first public appearance since escaping themassacre.   ``God is with us. We don't lose courage. The cleaning up hasjust begun,'' he said in a barely audible voice as the throngerupted in cheers. Two women shouted, ``He's alive, he's alive.''   Aristide, a frequent target of assassination by the Macoutes,was an outspoken critic of the Namphy government.</TEXT></DOC>
