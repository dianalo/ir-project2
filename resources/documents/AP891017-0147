Lawmakers considered constitutional amendments to eliminate allreferences to the leading role of the Communist Party and to bringthe constitution in line with new legislation setting legalpreconditions for multi-party elections due by June 1990.   Earlier this month, the Communist Party renamed itself theSocialist Party and committed itself to loosening its hold on powerand allowing multiparty democracy.   The draft amendments before parliament would end the pattern ofone-party rule, Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said.   ``Parties will not be able to wield direct power,'' he said,adding that they would ``declare rights not doled out by the statebut that are guaranteed for each ... citizen.''   Other bills before parliament include one on the functioning ofpolitical parties, the establishment of a constitutional court anda new electoral law.   The body also plans to debate the creation of the office ofstate president _ a new post that would replace the collectivepresidential council of 21 members. It also will discuss the rightsof the new president and set the date for a free election to thepost. The date has tentatively been set for Nov. 26.   However, before parliament opened its session, members of theopposition League of Free Democrats presented more than 120,000signatures on a petition calling for a referendum on the date andfor a postponement until after next year's national elections.   Opposition leaders believe that a presidential vote held beforethe parliamentary elections would favor the communist candidate,Minister of State and popular reformer Imre Pozsgay.   Under recently adopted legislation, parliament must decide oncalling a referendum within 60 days of receiving 100,000 signatureson a given issue.   Kulcsar instead suggested that parliament vote on the issuedespite the receipt of the petition, which opposition leaders saynow bears nearly 200,000 signatures.   He questioned the validity of the way signatures were collected,noting that the date of the presidential election was only one offour questions requiring a collective yes or no answer.   Maverick lawmaker Zoltan Kiraly also criticized the petition,saying the inclusion of other questions about the party's assetsand its armed guard, the Workers' Militia, misled some signers.   Members of the opposition League of Free Democrats, whichco-sponsored the petition with the League of Young Democrats, saidit had been conducted properly and charged that Kulcsar and Kiralywere campaigning for the presidential post by making remarksbroadcast on live television.   At the weekend the Patriotic People's Front, a mass socialorganization trying to shed its affiliation with the ruling party,nominated Kulcsar for president.   Kiraly has been proposed by a local group of the small SocialDemocratic party, but has denied being a presidential candidate.   Peter Toelgyessy of the Free Democrats said if the presidentialelections went ahead without a referendum, Hungary would ``not be astate of law but a police state.''</TEXT></DOC>
