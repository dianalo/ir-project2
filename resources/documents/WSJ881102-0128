Gurney compares himself with a medieval stonecutter caught in the wrong century, chipping away at flying buttresses in an age of I-beams and curtain walls. As his audience, we are implicated in the analogy: If writing plays is an antiquated craft, then we who watch them must be throwbacks as well, relics of a holier time.    Maybe that's why I left the Promenade Theater feeling . . . well, exalted. A good play can do that, of course. But the feeling inspired by &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot; goes beyond the thrill of hearing shap dialogue exchanged by interesting characters in an engrossing story. These elements aren't lacking here. Indeed, Mr. Gurney is in total command of his art. But in writing this play about writing this play, Mr. Gurney invites the audience to join him in the heady act of creation, to see the world with an artist's double vision. Simultaneously, &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot; gives us the playwright's world, and the use he makes of it. It's an exciting combination.    As always in Mr. Gurney's plays, we are in WASP country, Bush-and-Quayle-land, where adults are called things like &quot;Pookins&quot; and &quot;Jigger&quot;; where malaise can always be blamed on &quot;the servant problem&quot;; where psychiatry, FDR and Fiberglas boats are still considered somehow disreputable; and where the cocktail hour is sacred. At this particular cocktail hour, a playwright who closely resembles Mr. Gurney returns home to get his family's permission to put them on the stage.    The play is called -- what else? -- &quot;The Cocktail Hour,&quot; and its cast of characters closely resembles the one assembled by director Jack O'Brien on Steven Rubin's perfect living-room set. Bruce Davison plays John, the autobiographical gray sheep of the family, not sure whether he wants in or out of it; Keene Curtis plays Bradley, the controlling patriarch who thinks his checkbook can supply a solution to every family conflict; Nancy Marchand plays Ann, the mother who's more indulgent of her children's foibles but no less mystified; and Holland Taylor plays Nina, the older sister whose placid demeanor hides much resentment.    If it sounds as though Mr. Gurney is setting up a latter-day &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night,&quot; it's because a bare-bones description of this family doesn't begin to convey how funny it is. This is on one level a conventional, truth-telling family-confrontation play; but it's also a wry social satire. When Bradley finds out his son has put the family in his new play, his first question is, &quot;Do you use our names?&quot; Placated on that score, his next worry, beautifully timed by Mr. Curtis, is, &quot;I suppose you make {two beats} cracks.&quot;    God, yes, Mr. Gurney makes cracks, although more often than not, he puts them in the mouths of the other characters rather than in his surrogate's. John comes across as rather earnest, self-involved and astute about everything except his own motives; it's Mr. Davison's performance that makes him so appealing. But the other three are winning comic creations, quirky yet classic. &quot;Just a splash,&quot; coos Ms. Marchand as she holds out her martini glass for a refill. &quot;Oh, that damned war,&quot; sputters Mr. Curtis when the talk turns to the '40s. And Ms. Taylor erupts in a vehement denunciation of all the good things she's had in life when she finds out that despite all his efforts, John has been unable to turn her into anything but a minor character in &quot;The Cocktail Hour.&quot;    No, things do not look good for John's play. Nina resents her small part. Bradley doesn't relish the prospect of &quot;complete strangers roaring their heads off&quot; at him. And Ann wishes John could just write books, which &quot;aren't quite so public.&quot; It's not that his parents don't like the theater. They have fond memories of plays in which actors behaved like ladies and gentlemen, never took off their clothes, and certainly never swore. They don't understand why their son persists in writing plays when he has a perfectly good day job. The irony, of course, is that for all his rebelliousness, these are precisely the kinds of plays John writes, as we know from the one before us.    Indeed, the one moment of dramatic crisis in &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot; is precipitated by the use of a mildly improper word. There is another crisis, but it's happening offstage, where a substitute maid whose name nobody seems able to get is methodically ruining dinner. As the cocktail hour gets longer and longer, we discover that there's another writer in the family, one who has destroyed a book because the &quot;feelings&quot; weren't right. John confesses that he, too, has trouble getting feelings right. And this play has none of the &quot;tempestuous passions&quot; of the discarded novel. The emotions in it flow between the playwright and his audience. More than most of the audience-participation stunts that are in vogue at the moment, this play needs our presence to complete it. The impeccable prediction we are watching is the play that's being talked about onstage. We know more about it than any of the characters, including its author, and without us, it would be nothing at all. It is a playwright's affirmation of himself, his audience and their mutual dependence and, thus, an act of astonishing generosity. I, for one, am deeply grateful. </TEXT></DOC>
