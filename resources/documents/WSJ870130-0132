Xerox's insurance unit, however, continued to post soaring profits, and executives see an upturn in sluggish photocopier sales this year.    David T. Kearns, chairman, said that while he sees an unspecified improvement in Xerox's main product lines this year, the company nonetheless will continue to reduce jobs, capital spending and discretionary expenses in 1987. Mr. Kearns gave a private briefing to Wall Street analysts yesterday morning, followed by a news conference later in the day.    The company took several unusual charges and gains for the fourth quarter and year. The charges mask improving results fueled by surging profits in financial services, while the gains helped operating earnings without an actual upturn in the office-equipment business.    Net income in the fourth quarter fell sharply, partly because of the $51 million charge to reserve for losses in an insurance operation that was closed in 1985. Net was $87 million, or 77 cents a share, compared with $156 million, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier, when results included a $42 million gain on the sale of a publishing operation.    Revenue from Xerox's major line of business -- photocopiers, printers and computer systems -- rose 8% in the quarter to $2.72 billion from $2.51 billion a year earlier.    After-tax profit from Xerox office equipment rose 3% to $88 million in the quarter but fell sharply for the year, down 26% to $260 million from $351 million in 1985. Xerox's president and chief operating officer, Paul A. Allaire, said Xerox misread the market early last year and had boosted the office-equipment work force by 500 people in anticipation of strong demand that didn't materialize.    Since then, the payroll has been reduced by 1,200 people through attrition as well as some dismissals. An additional 1,100 people will take early retirement by February, and the biggest part of the Xerox payroll -- the 103,000 people on the office-equipment side compared with 12,000 in financial services -- will be reduced further this year.    &quot;We have more overhead (staff) personnel than we can afford,&quot; Mr. Allaire said. Executives wouldn't say how much they hope to trim, but Mr. Kearns, the chairman, said &quot;our hope&quot; is to avoid outright dismissals.    While troubles continue in the photocopier business, Xerox's controversial move to diversify into insurance, investment banking and leasing has finally paid off -- and handsomely. The company was criticized for the diversification in 1985, as huge losses at the Crum andamp; Forster insurance unit dragged down Xerox's overall performance.    But now Crum andamp; Forster, the centerpiece of Xerox's financial services, is the primary drive behind soaring profits from that sector. Profit from Xerox's financial-services units was up 81% to $50 million in the quarter from $28 million a year earlier. Full-year earnings from financial services soared to $228 million from a dismal $30 million in 1985.    Xerox executives touted the improvement in earnings from continuing operations, which rose 22% to $138 million in the quarter. But the result would have risen only 2.6% without the $21 million gain taken because of a tax-law change. Full-year earnings from continuing operations were up 28% to $488 million and would have risen 22% without the tax-law gain.    But Stuart Ross, Xerox's chief financial officer, contended the fourth-quarter rise in continuing earnings was strong even without a one-time gain, because the company also took insurance-related charges that exceeded the $21 million tax boost.    In all of 1986, Xerox net fell 2% to $465 million, or $4.28 a share, from $475 million, or $4.44 a share, in 1985. The 1986 figure includes a $65 million charge for operations shed during the year and a $42 million onetime gain because of an accounting change for a pension plan. The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of $94 million from the operation and later sale of publishing and equipment units that were discontinued.    In the quarter, revenue from other sources, including interest, was added to office-equipment sales to make total revenue $2.83 billion. In the full year, other revenue added $426 million to the equipment sales to raise total revenue about 10% to $9.78 billion from $8.9 billion in 1985.    Xerox also broke out financial-services revenue for the first time, combining it with office-equipment sales and restating year-earlier figures, in effect boosting overall revenue. Revenue from financial services rose 16% to $950 million in the quarter and increased 19% to $3.56 billion in the year. That new accounting put Xerox's total revenue at $3.67 billion for the quarter, up 10% from a restated $3.33 billion a year earlier, and pushed the full-year total to $12.92 billion, up 11% from $11.68 billion in 1985.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Xerox shares closed at $68.375, up $1. </TEXT></DOC>
