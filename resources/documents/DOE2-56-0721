Due to its extended use and to thecompetition within the industry for plants and services, this reactorsystem is being further improved and developed, assuring its furthergrowth well into the next century. Complementary types of nuclear reactors,modular high temperature reactors (HTR-M) and breeders, have been testedin prototype and demonstration plants and will be made available forcommercial use. The HTR-M opens up additional fields of deployment fornuclear energy - such as process heat, oil recovery and coal gasification- while the breeder assures long-term exploitation of uranium to itsfull potential. The high conversion reactor, still in the planning stage,allows more flexibility in achieving the optimal mix of uranium consumingand plutonium producing reactors. If the energy demand of the still risingworld population is not to lead to early depletion of oil and gas norto increase the atmospheric carbon dioxide content to levels which endangerthe terrestrial climate, then for all practical purposes only nuclearpower can make a stabilizing contribution during the coming decades.</TEXT></DOC>
