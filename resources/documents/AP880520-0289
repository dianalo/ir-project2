Peter Marx, head counsel for a group of customers of DataGeneral Corp., said he plans a meeting Monday in Boston withrepresentatives of at least a dozen similar groups connected toother computer firms, including International Business MachinesCorp., Digital Equipment Corp. and NCR Corp.   The proposed coalition of user groups would establish a strongervoice and greater clout for users concerning development of newsoftware systems, said Marx. It also would serve as a liaisonbetween the computer users and the public and Congress, he said.   A user group is an umbrella organization composed of companiesusing the same type of computer system. The members generally usethe group to share information and express concerns to individualmanufacturers.   ``You look at the articles written about the computer industryand there is hardly any mention of users, and users are what it isall about,'' said Marx, who also serves as counsel for theWashington, D.C.-based Information Industry Association andchairman of the New England Computer Law Forum in Boston.   ``There is no voice now for the users. There are some years ofchaos ahead until this issue of a standard operating system issettled. It's time the users should be united.''   On Tuesday, four American and three European computers announcedformation of a joint $90 million project to create a softwarepackage modeled after the Unix operating system by AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph. Unix, which controls the basic operation ofa computer, has been sought by non-ATandamp;T customers because it allowscomputers from different manufacturers to use the same programs.   ``If we're moving in the direction of a standard, then it'svital we make our presence known,'' said Marx. ``It would be toocostly to have a system we can't live with. Leverage is important.''   Others agreeing to attend the Monday meeting includerepresentatives of the user groups for Honeywell Bull Inc., PrimeComputer Inc., Xerox Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. Marx wouldnot name the other user groups planning to attend the meeting.   Several computer industry analysts question the feasibility of anationwide coalition of user groups.   ``It would be noble cause, but I'm pretty skeptical it couldsucceed because there are too many vested interests among theusers,'' said Robert Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research Inc.in Phoenix, Ariz.   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``there is a strong need for theuser to speak in unison rather than be led by vendor interest.Users have generally been meek and mild and non-confrontational,and this has actually hurt them right in the pocketbooks.''   Michael Geran, an analyst at Nikko Securities Co. InternationalInc. in New York, said the push toward connectivity among differentcomputer systems could unite users in the future, but the varietyof needs may pull apart the proposed coalition.   ``What's good for one user is not good for another at thispoint,'' said Geran. ``It seems there are just too manyapplications and needs to unite the users.''</TEXT></DOC>
