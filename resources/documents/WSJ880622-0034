In Florida, a chiropractor hires foreign doctors who speak little English to work in a medical clinic. The names of the unwitting physicians are then stamped on bogus insurance claims, and the reimbursement checks are sent to mail drops set up by the chiropractor.    In Michigan, a group of physicians and pharmacists open a clinic that illegally dispenses prescription drugs to addicts. The cost to the addict? A sample of blood, which the clinic &quot;analyzes&quot; and then uses as the basis for fraudulent insurance claims of about $700 for each addict.    It wasn't long ago that most health-insurance scams were variations of simple bill-padding schemes. A practitioner, for instance, might add a couple of questionable tests to increase a patient's bill. Or the bill sent to the insurer would be inflated, allowing the patient to be completely reimbursed for the actual charge.    Those schemes still exist. But new kinds of health-insurance scams are popping up around the U.S. These scams are more elaborate -- and tougher to track down.    Many of the cases now &quot;involve conspiracies not only among several physicians, but among groups of providers -- physicians, pharmacists and medical laboratories,&quot; says Larry Kuhl, a special agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington.    Adds Michael A. Israelite, an assistant vice president at Cigna Corp.: &quot;They're complex enough that in many instances you don't figure them out until you've paid a lot of money.&quot;    Overall, health-insurance fraud rakes in $10 billion a year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. At a minimum, such abuse translates into higher premiums for companies and individual policyholders, insurers say. But the problem also means that patients are suffering.    &quot;Any time a practitioner's top priority is income and the patient's welfare is secondary, we have to worry about the quality of care the patient is receiving,&quot; says James L. Garcia, an Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. official and chairman of the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association.    Insurers say the growth in fraud has been sparked by recent changes in the health-care industry. Squeezed by cost-containment programs as well as by increased competition, some health providers are turning to &quot;creative billing&quot; to bolster their incomes. Moreover, with health-care expenditures in the U.S. now totaling almost $500 billion a year, &quot;the temptation to skim some of that money has just become enormous,&quot; says Mr. Israelite.    Some schemes even cut the patients in on the deal. Officials in Chicago are investigating a ring of about 35 doctors who Travelers Corp., a Hartford, Conn., insurer, says have submitted hundreds of thousands of dollars of inflated or fraudulent claims -- some of which were used as payoffs to patients.    The doctors, says Tom Raitt, an associate manager in Travelers' Naperville, Ill., office, hire &quot;runners&quot;-people who steer patients to the physicians' offices. These patients may be actual accident victims or simply people the runners have met, often in bars. In some cases, the patients act as victims in &quot;accidents&quot; staged by the runners, Mr. Raitt says. The patients are divided into &quot;players&quot; -- who are aware of the scam and receive kickbacks from the doctors -- and &quot;non-players&quot; -- those who just receive medical attention.    Both players and non-players usually have one thing in common: a valid insurance card from a group medical plan. Once the patient enters the doctor's office, says Mr. Raitt, that insurance card is the ticket that enables the physician to file exaggerated or false claims. Sometimes the abuse involves outright medical fraud: doctors performing unnecessary surgery just to collect an insurance claim.    A patient &quot;will come in for something slight; they'll say, `My wrist is bothering me,' &quot; explains Mr. Raitt. &quot;But the doctor will say it's a 'ganglion tendon' that has to be relieved with minor surgery.&quot; The result: an inflated insurance claim.    But the problem doesn't stop there. &quot;Ten months later, we get the same bill for the other wrist,&quot; Mr. Raitt says. But the second operation exists only on paper; it typically is never performed.    Bilking corporate medical plans is the centerpiece of what carriers describe as the biggest health-insurance fraud in the nation: the rolling labs that have plagued California and are now spreading to the Midwest and East Coast.    &quot;It's an immense problem,&quot; says R. James Guzzi Jr., director of the claims division at Travelers, which received more than $1 million in claims from such operations between January and April. Insurers estimate that in California alone such labs have filed fraudulent claims totaling $80 million in the past three years.    Operators of the mobile labs usually offer &quot;free&quot; diagnostic tests to members of health clubs and corporate fitness programs. Those members, insurers say, are perfect targets. Because they are interested in health, they are more likely to sign up for the tests -- and they tend to belong to corporate medical plans.    The word &quot;free,&quot; however, applies only to the patient. Once the lab completes its cardiac studies, blood tests, ultrasound exams and the like, the claims -- often ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 a person -- are filed with insurers.    In almost all cases, the tests aren't needed and the charges are excessive, insurers say. But stopping payment to one or two labs does little good. The operations simply &quot;change their tax identification number and name and submit the exact same bill&quot; with a different business name and new tax number, making it difficult to track them down, says Mr. Guzzi.    To fight such abuse, the insurance industry has set up special investigation units, tightened audit procedures and improved contacts among companies to identify fraudulent claims. Federal and local law-enforcement agencies, meanwhile, are making greater use of mail-fraud statutes and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to prosecute health providers in such scams.    Sometimes their efforts succeed. The chiropractor who hired foreign physicians was convicted in U.S. district court in Tampa, Fla., in April of mail fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government, filing false claims totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, and racketeering, among other charges. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and is appealing the conviction.    And in March, four people -- including a physician and a pharmacist -- were convicted in U.S. District Court in Detroit of racketeering for their involvement in the Michigan clinic that analyzed blood samples taken from drug addicts. The four received sentences ranging from 18 months to 17 years. The scheme brought in $7 million to $10 million before the arrests.    Still, insurers say they frequently fall short in trying to stop fraud schemes. The insurance industry these days is trying to cut costs, which means less money is available for the time-consuming task of tracking fraud. And scam artists have learned to take advantage of the insurers' computerized claims operations. &quot;They're very educated in what an insurance company is looking at and not looking at,&quot; says Mr. Raitt.    Moreover, says Aetna's Mr. Garcia, when it comes to health-insurance fraud &quot;there's a perception that no one really cares -- that it's an accepted practice.&quot;    Take a recent group of claims investigated by Travelers, for instance. Five employees from one company agreed to undergo a battery of questionable diagnostic tests for which the health provider submitted five identical claims of $475 each. The employees, it turned out, were all members of the same softball team. Their incentive for participating in the scam? The health-care provider promised to give each of them a new softball jacket.    ---                  The Feds Zero in on Fraud   In fiscal year 1986, federal officials obtained 106 criminal convictions and took 412 administrative actions* against individuals and institutions involved in Medicare fraud.
