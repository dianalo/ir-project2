A full-scaleload test was performed assuming that a truck entered a sidewalk. A reviewof the dynamic strength of protective piping and the current capacityof cables obtained from the test shows that burying the line to a depthof as shallow as 30 cm is free of trouble. Road Traffic Law and otherregulations specify the minimum earth covering as 60 cm or more undersidewalks. Burying at a depth of 30 cm will greatly reduce costs. TheCenter has studied ways to improve thermal diffusion characteristicsusing a heat pipe to reduce the size of directly-buried-type transformers.The Center has also observed by full-scale tests that the transformerscan be reduced to a size equal to that of overhead type versions. TheCenter uses power distribution lines for signal transmission to studythe ideal form of an advanced information system, new automation technology,measures to counter instantaneous voltage drop, and the application ofamorphous material and ether new materials.
