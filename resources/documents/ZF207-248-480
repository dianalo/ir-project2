 Let'stalk about their Model 761 Video Transmission System, shall we?andM;The 761 transmits one channel of studio quality baseband video and audiothrough the air, point-to-point.andP;  Any one-volt composite video signal fromsources such as TV cameras, VTRs or demodulated-microwave basebands can besent up to a mile.andP;  The receiver reproduces the transmitted signal to drivecoaxial cables, microwave transmitters, video monitors or another 761 relaylink.andM;The system consists of one transmitter and one receiver housed in ruggedaluminum cases which are suitable for outdoor installation, although they maybe mounted indoors to transmit through glass windows.andP;  The receiver containsan optical filter which makes it impervious to extraneous lighting.andM;CALIFORNIA MICROWAVEandM;California Microwave's TXR-1001 and TXR-1004 radios transmit digital signalsat 10 GHz frequencies.andP;  The TXR-1001 unit accepts one T-1 signal into itsheart in the DS-1 format.andM;The TXR-1004 provides 6.312 Mbps transmission in the DS-2 format or four T-1signals with DS-1 format.andP;  Only a 5-MHz band is needed for transmitting thatDS-2 signal.andM;The products feature narrow transmitter bandwidths, high-stabilityfrequencies and are receiver selectable to allow many radio links to beinstalled in a small area.andP;  Reliable operation can go as high as the 12- to16-mile ballpark with but two-foot antennas.andM;DIGITAL MICROWAVEandM;Digital Microwave (San Jose, CA) is definitely a leader in the wonderfulworld of short-haul microwave technology.andP;  It seems there's alwaysinnovations and news pumping from this impressive machine-like corporation.andM;We'll have to focus on a particular innovation.andP;  It's a cool one.andP;  Somethingthey calla Forward Error Correction Enhancement Option.andM;The Forward Error Correction (FEC) option was built for their W Series Radioproduct line.andP;  FEC increases the products' system gain by four dB, usingproprietary hardware and software algorithms developed by DMC that are bittoo complicated to get into here.andP;  By the by, those W radio are available in8, 13, 18 and 23 GHz frequencies.andM;In addition to extending the performance of the radios, FEC has two otherstrong points.andP;  First, it provides real-time, continuous performance and BitError Ratio (BER) monitoring.andP;  An operator can actually sit there and look ata few LEDs that tell him how things are working.andP;  We saw a demo of this atComNet.andP;  It's a great feature, eliminating the need for external testequipment and telemetry to check link performance.andM;Secondly, because of the added system gain that FEC produces, the intendedone might be able to save on the size of the antenna he needs, thus reducingcost.andP;  Always a good thing.andM;ISHERandM;Isher (Santa Clara, CA) has been making infrared communication things andsecurity systems for over 17 years.andP;  They were the first company to producean Ethernet-compatible system in 1987, which allows companies to create acampus-wide network fast and inexpensive.andM;Speaking of &quot;campus-wide,&quot; Isher recently hooked up with the fiber/coaxialdata-backbone company -- Luxcom -- to become up with a system they call theDL-87LC Infrared System.andP;  It's an infrared-based data communication systemthat links various IBM networks between buildings in a campus environment.andM;The Luxcom Model LC-100 Mux and the Isher DL-87/LC Airpath Repeater weresuccessfully integrated at Friendly Hills Hospital in La Habra, CA.andP;  Itworks.andP;  Listen to Chris Turner, the telecom manager there.andM;&quot;It offers us significant savings over other alternatives.andP;  It lets uscommunicate with our computer at better than 100 times the previous rate.andO;And we're not dependent on the telco for our data link.&quot;andM;The system integrates buildings up to a kilometer away.andP;  It works with IBM3270, System 3X and/or AS/400 networks.andM;LASER COMMUNICATIONSandM;We've never included this company in one of short-haul buyers' guides before.andO;We don't know why we haven't.andP;  It's just another mystery of the universe.andM;Anyway, they make short-haul laser stuff.andP;  They're located in Lancaster, PA(could their location have anything to do with the fact that we had a hardtime finding them?).andP;  Their latest product is something called the L00-36.andM;They like to call it &quot;fiber without the fiber.&quot;andP;  With two of the L00-36s oneither end of the hop, accompanied by a couple of channel banks, you cantransmit a T-1 signal.andP;  And that's without any FCC snags.andP;  It works up toapproximately the one-kilometer range and that whole package mentioned aboveruns for around $12,500.andP;  That's a good price.andM;M/A-COMandM;This Chelmsford, MA-based company came out with a new product recently.andP;  It'scalled the MA-23VX.andM;It's a 23 GHz microwave system available in three configurations for bothvoice and data communications: T-1 only; LAN only; and a simultaneouscombination of both.andP;  List prices range from around 10 to 15 grand for acomplete full-duplex system.andP;  For what it can do, that's a simply fabulousprice.andM;Like most of the systems you'll find here, it gives the intended acost-effective alternative to T-1 service from the local common carrier.andP;  Inmost cases, this system will pay for itself in less than a year.andP;  It can alsobe used to connect Ethernet LANs to a full 10 Mbps.andP;  This lets youinterconnect to LANs at up to eight times the speed of T-1 interconnectionwithout using coax or fiber-optic cable.andM;LANs meeting IEEE 802.3 Ethernet and 802.5 Token Ring specs are connected tothe MA-23VX using third party LAN interfaces.andP;  It acts as a pipeline, passingall information without regard to protocol.andM;The unit also has a scramble/descrambler for a high level of voice and datasecurity, with up to 1,024 user-selectable scrambling codes.andP;  The MA-23VX istransparent to the PCM-framing format which allows it to interface with awide variety of T-1 terminals.andM;It is equipped with a standard one-foot antenna for applications involvinglinks under four miles.andP;  A two-foot antenna is used for applicationsinvolving longer hops.andP;  Maximum range of the system varies with the type ofdata being transmitted (T-1 or LAN) and the characteristics of thegeographical area where the system is installed.andM;There's also a video version of the system.andP;  It supports 525- and 625-linevideo plus up to two FM subcarriers for audio and/or data channels.andP;  For onetrade magazine, anyway, life does have meaning now.andM;MICROWAVE NETWORKSandM;There are several new announcements from his Houston-based company.andM;The first is their new version of the MicroNet 23 LAN radio whichincorporates DES encryption and bridging functions.andP;  It offers many importantfeatures for the Ethernet user who wishes to extend his LAN via microwave.andO;Safe, secure transmission with DES encryption built into the radio'sinterface insures complete privacy at all times.andM;The full-duplex radio and bridging features in the interface allow distancesup to 15 miles with collision detection limitations.andP;  Additional externalbridges are not required since all the usual bridge features are built intothat interface.andM;Microwave Networks has also come out with a new line of 18 GHz radios.andP;  Usingthe same baseband modems already proven in the MicroNet 15 and 23 radios, thenew line is ideal for the last mile or first mile of any communication link.andM;They features tunable RF transmitter and receiver units.andP;  The latesttechnologies in gallium arsenide, surface-mounted components, bead leaddiodes and MIL-Spec parts have been slammed into this new line.andM;They've also come out with a new data radio that tackles one of telecomnewest buzzword -- fractional.andP;  As in T-1.andP;  This new microwave link at either15 or 23 GHz offers fractional T-1 data for a bunch of digital applications.andM;It's full-duplex, transmitting at the basic T-1 rate of 1.544 Mbps fordistance up to 10 miles.andP;  And an integral time-division mux takes data fromone to four input ports and frames the serial data stream into a T-1 formatfor transmission across the microwave link.andM;The data rate is switch selectable at one end of the link from a menu ofpopular rates from 56 to 768 Kbps.andP;  Any combination of inputs can be used aslong as the aggregate data rate does not exceed 1.472 Mbps.andM;MOTOROLAandM;Like most of the companies in this guide, Motorola has been busy upgradingand introducing.andP;  We can't tell you everything.andP;  But we'll try to whet yourappetite.andM;First, there's the new UltraStar 18 DLR digital microwave radio.andP;  The thingoffers digital interfaces of DS-2 and 4xDS-1 for use in the US, and CEPT-1,CEPT2 or 4xCEPT-1 for use internationally.andP;  It comes in both non-switchoverand true hot-switchover configurations to insure nice redundancy.andM;It features synthesized Automatic Frequency Control for easy frequencychanges in the field and the elimination of frequency-dependent components.andO;It's also constructed in a modular fashion, so field serving or replacementcan be done without any special tools.andP;  A standard integral part tester helpsto confirm microwave link integrity for a more efficient and cost-efectivesystem.andM;Motorola has also come out with second generation of their 23 GHz line.andP;  Thefirst products include the UltraStar DLR, Multi T-1 and DS-3.andP;  All havegreater capacity than their predecessors.andM;The DLR model has a separate antenna and radio unit so the user can realignthe path without waiting for service.andP;  The Multi T-1 unit comes complete with12-T-1 multiplex ports.andP;  And the DS-3 features 28 T-1 line capacity for up to672 channels for voice and data.andM;All three feature field-tuneable broadband frequency oscillators.andP;  Theoscillators keep sparing to a minimum and data rate upgrades can be easilymade in the field through plug-in module replacement without the system goingoff the air.andP;  True hot-switchover protection provides inpedendent switchingof the transmitter, receiver and modem.andM;Last September, Motorola announced a product that would support transmittingEthernet over Microwave at 10 Mbps.andP;  The UltraStar 23 LAN Microwave Systemincludes a radio and a buffered repeater and data-linked layer Ethernetbirdge.andP;  It provides 10 Mbps extension of the standard IEEE 802.3 Ethernetnetwork transmissions to users in worldwide markets with multi-LANfacilities.andM;That bridges, based on their highly successful 68010 microprocessor chip,provides throughput filtering in excess of 11,000 packets per second,sophisticated network management features and automatic backup.andM;RACONandM;Racon (Seattle, WA) came out with their 23 GHz Micropass 8000 Series earlylast year.andP;  It's as full-featured and sophisticated as any of the other stuffyou're gonna find here, with compact antenna units providing full-duplexdigital communication of voice and data and expandable from one to fourT-1/DS-1 lines.andM;Later last year, they came out with their 8500 Series.andP;  This line of radiossprung out of the 8000 Series.andP;  It was built specifically (but notexclusively) for the transmission of duplex real-time full-motion video.andO;This is becoming more and more of a big market niche for microwave people.andM;Working reliably up to around 15 miles, its features include: a typicalsystem gain of 179 dB; modular construction which allows upgrading for audioand data/control subchannels; choice of one, two or four foot antennas; andan optional 24VDC or 240vac power supply.andP;  The high performance radiooperates in the 21.2 to 23.6 GHz frequency band.andP;  It's engineered for futureexpansion capabilities.andM;Racon has been marketing this nice video system very effectively to a coupleof niches.andP;  One is something called distance learning.andP;  That's where in acity or campus environment they use the system as the transmission medium forinteractive (communication goes both ways between, say, students andlecturer) education.andP;  The other application is court arraignment.andM;We've talked about this before.andP;  Instead of shlepping the defendants fromjail (usually outside city limits) to court for arraignments, they do it overvideo.andP;  Saves a lot of time and money.andP;  First off, a lot of the expense fortransporting the unfortunate in this case comes from police budgets.andP;  Theycan certainly use the money and the manpower for other causes, like fightingcrime.andP;  Imagine that?andM;ROCKWELLandM;INTERNATIONALandM;Rockwell's MDR-3X18 digital microwave radio is part of a product line ofmicrowave radio systems for businesses and common carriers.andM;The MDR-3X18 series is a family of 18 GHz radios for business short haulapplications.andP;  They're available with 4 DS1, 8 DS1 or 28 DS1 capacity.andP;  Theirrange is from 1.8 miles for an MDR-3418 with a two-foot antenna in a wetregion to 24.6 miles for an MDR-3118 with a six-foot antenna in a dry region.andM;The system also touts a high system gain -- from 106 dB to 98 dB.andP;  The radioshave single-unit packaging.andP;  They can be used indoors or out and have adirect DS1 or DS3 interface.andP;  There is a hot standby option, but you willprobably never need it, the series has a mean time between failure rate ofmore than 14 years.andM;Other Rockwell microwave products include the new MDR-5102 2 GHz commoncarrier microwave radio which carries 12 DS-1s in 3.5 MHz of bandwidth.andP;  Italso features forward error correction, hitless receiver switching andautomatic power control -- which improves system gain by 3 dBs.andM;The MDR-1111 11 GHz radio is also fairly new.andP;  It is a common carrier systemthat carries 12 DS1s.andM;Rounding out the line is the MDR-4106.andP;  The MDR-4106 6 Ghz radio is alsoavailable in a common carrier model -- MDR-4106C.andP;  Both models feature fourdigital service channels and 1 DS3 capacity -- that's 672 voice channels.andM;TELCO SYSTEMSandM;Telco Systems (Norwood, MA) makes systems for short-haul fiber applications.andO;Recently they introduced something called the FOX-3 broadband fiber-hubbingsystem.andP;  It's a loop application.andM;Using the FOX-3 with their M560 fiber-optic terminal, traffic can be sentover fiber at 560 Mbps and then directly extended from that same terminal at45 Mbps to as many as 12 additional locations.andM;The system consists of a dual-optical transceiver card that replaces one ofthe low speed DS-3 interface cards in Telco System's M560 fiber terminal.andO;The card optically extends one or two protected 45 Mbps channels to their828AF fiber muxes at remote sites up to 40 kilometers away.andM;Optical plug-ins can be mixed with DS-3 electrical interfaces in the sameM560 terminal enabling users to interface electrical DS-3s at the fiber-hublocation.andP;  Conversion from electrical to optical interfaces can be done whilethe M560 is in service.andM;Because it eliminates the need for back-to-back muxes that would otherwise berequired to extend at 45 Mbps from the hub, the system offers a significantreduction in hardware costs.andP;  Also smaller space and power demands, easierinstall, maintenance and administration.andM;TELESCIENCESandM;TeleSciences Transmission Systems (Fremont, CA) swallowed up Avantek -- oneour usual participants in this exercise of spec-sheet paraphrasing.andP;  Butanyway you slice it, quality short-haul products are still being made.andP;  We'lltease you with two systems -- one 23 GHz radio and one 18 GHz.andM;The DR23A digital microwave radio employs direct FSK modulation (you wantedto know that, didn't you).andP;  It transmits at DS-1, DS-2 and both internationalstandards of CEPT 1 and 2.andP;  It's equipped with all kinds of nice self-testcircuits and it does have loopback test switching.andM;Among other things, it's simple to install and replace components.andP;  With theT/R module located in an outdoor weather-resistant enclosure, the installerhas easy access to all electronic assemblies.andP;  The inside control unit caneither be rack-mounted or plopped on a desktop.andM;Their DR18C products can transmit 6 DS-1 channels (144 digitally formattedvoice and/or data circuits) point-to-point at 10 Mbps.andP;  It incorporates astandard built-in mux for up to six T-1 lines.andM;Maintenance and alarm reporting is done through the use of up to twodigitized 300 Hz to 3.3 KHz toll-quality service channels.andP;  It's also veryeasy to install and maintain this one physically.andP;  Make no mistake, it ismodular in design.andM;Connection to indoor equipment from antenna unit and outside assembly isthrough a single coax cable which can extend up to 1,200 feet.andP;  Maintenanceof a 1x1 hot-standby protected system can be accomplished with trafficinterruption, allowing repairs during business hours.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
