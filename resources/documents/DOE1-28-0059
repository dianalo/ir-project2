The global modesare obtained by integrating numerically the linearized collisionlessBoltzmann equation as an initial value problem. Modal calculations havebeen made for a series of disks with bulges of different length scalesbut of the same mass, half that of the disks. The results show that avery compact bulge can reduce disk instabilities remarkably. It is suggestedthat the hotness of the central part of a disk and inner Lindblad resonancesplay an important role in stabilization of a disk.</TEXT></DOC>
