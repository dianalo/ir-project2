Levine, whosesquealings led to the Ivan Boesky scandal and a crackdown on WallStreet corruption, has finished his prison term but remains underJustice Department supervision, federal officials said Friday.   Levine was released Thursday from a Manhattan halfway house forfederal inmates, Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman Kathryn Johnson saidin a telephone query. He had been transferred there July 5 from aprison camp in Lewisburg, Pa., where he had been confined sinceApril 6, 1987.   Martin Flumenbaum, Levine's attorney, confirmed his client hadbeen released but would not disclose his whereabouts or whether hewas employed.   Formerly a mergers specialist at the investment firm DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., Levine was arrested in May 1986 after theSecurities and Exchange Commission accused him of making $12.6million in profits through illegal trading on inside information.   After pleading guilty in a cooperation agreement with federalprosecutors, Levine was sentenced to a two-year prison term oncharges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.   Technically, he was not scheduled for release until next April3, but his time was reduced for good behavior under federalcriminal sentencing laws.   ``He's not serving his sentence any longer, but he's stillsubject to the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office,'' saidDavid Chapman, executive assistant at the Lewisburg camp. ``Anyviolation at all, and he would have to serve the rest of hissentence.''   For example, if Levine failed a drug test, consorted with otherfelons, carried a gun or left the probation office's jurisdictionarea without permission, he could be returned to prison, Chapmansaid.   But ``with a white-collar criminal like this, he probably won'thave too many restrictions on him,'' Chapman added.   Michael Luciano, chief probation officer for the SouthernDistrict of New York, who is in charge of Levine's supervision,said he expected no special restrictions would be established forLevine, except for the standard rule of no travel outside thedistrict without permission.   The district comprises the Manhattan and Bronx districts of NewYork City plus six counties north of the city.   Luciano said Levine also was expected to work unless he wasattending school. He would not comment on Levine's living oremployment status.   Whatever work Levine does, it will not be related to WallStreet. Under an SEC order against him, Levine ``is barred from anyparticipation in any form of the securities business, in anycapacity.''   A 36-year-old father of two who grew up in a Queens, N.Y.middle-class family, Levine was once regarded as an ambitioussecurities professional who drove a Ferrari, ate $200 lunches andspent more than $250,000 to renovate his swank Park Ave. apartment.   When the SEC caught up with him in 1986, Levine admitted he hadparlayed $40,000 into a profit of $12.6 million through a five-yearscheme of insider trading on impending corporate takeovers.   It was Levine's cooperation with federal authorities that ledthem to Boesky, the Wall Street speculator who used sensitiveinformation provided by Levine to profit on insider trading himself.   Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million in illicit insidertrading profits and penalties in November 1986. He is now serving athree-year federal prison term for conspiracy to lie to the SEC.   Both men provided extensive information to prosecutors andimplicated other securities professionals in a widespread insidertrading scandal that has jolted the securities business and raiseda clamor about Wall Street ethics.   The latest fallout from the Boesky scandal was a massive SECenforcement action Wednesday against Drexel Burnham Lambert,Levine's former employer. The SEC accused Drexel and several keyemployees with insider trading, stock manipulation, cheatingclients, falsifying records and other alleged frauds. Thedefendants denied the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
