A year earlier, the Buffalo, N.Y., banking concern had net income of $7.6 million, including $6 million in special gains. It wasn't held publicly at that time.    Ross B. Kenzie, chairman and chief executive officer, said the loss primarily reflects write-downs on real-estate properties as well as the effects of economic events. The latter include a relatively low level of securities gains and a decreased net interest margin from higher deposit costs.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Goldome was unchanged at $3.375 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
