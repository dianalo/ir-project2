The average rose 4.18 to 2699.17, just 23.25 points below its August 1987 record close of 2722.42. Gains in Boeing, Aluminum Co. of America, Eastman Kodak and International Business Machines accounted for most of its advance.    Broader averages were narrowly mixed. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.06 to 349.35, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.06 to 194.13.    New York Stock Exchange volume was heavy for the second consecutive day at 200,340,000 shares, compared with 197,580,000 Monday. Contributing to the increased volume, traders said, were profit-taking, activity in takeover stocks, portfolio managers moving their holdings between sectors and foreign buying.    Portfolio managers' switch out of recession-resistant stocks and into shares more sensitive to economic growth continued. Some accounts appear to be turning even more bullish and are jumping into technology stocks, traders said.    IBM gained 7/8 to 118 1/4 on volume of 2.6 million shares, while Digital Equipment rose 3 3/4 to 101 3/4 on 1.6 million shares. The rush to technology issues also forced bearish speculators who had sold borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back later at lower prices to buy more shares to cover their positions, traders said.    Analysts said the market appeared to be registering a vote of confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability to keep the economy on a non-recessionary growth path. Bank stocks were sold, a sign that investors don't expect interest rates to drop much further. But the move to economically sensitive shares reflects expectations of good corporate earnings. &quot;We are somewhere between a soft landing and good earnings, even if interest rates stay high,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;Investors are walking a tightrope.&quot;    James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott, said the market will be in for a rude awakening if rates don't drop further. &quot;This market is artificially pumped up by foreign money and pension funds who think they've missed the rally,&quot; he said, but those props will give way if investors decide rates won't fall much further.    Among declining bank stocks, First Chicago fell 1 1/8 to 46 7/8, Citicorp slipped 7/8 to 31 7/8, and Chase Manhattan eased 3/8 to 38 3/4. Insurance company stocks, also sensitive to interest rates, fell as well.    Kemper tumbled 3/4 to 44 5/8, and Loews dropped 1 1/8 to 120 1/4.    Yesterday, however, investors clearly weren't focusing on interest rates but on the market's ability to rally. Buy orders materialized whenever stocks traded lower. &quot;The sell-offs just aren't lasting,&quot; said Sid Dorr, vice president, sales and trading, at Charles Schwab andamp; Co. in San Francisco.    Takeover speculation fueled much of the interest. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, which posted a historic single-day rise of 94.06 Monday, gained an additional 11.74 to 1355.80. UAL, the subject of a takeover offer, again led the average higher, rising 8 1/2 to 219 1/4 on nearly two million shares.    Boeing, the best performer in percentage terms among the 30 industrial average stocks, jumped 2 1/2 to 53 7/8, a 4.9% rise. Kodak gained 1 3/8 to 49, Alcoa rose 1 3/8 to 74, and Woolworth rose 1 1/4 to 60 5/8.    Those rallies allowed the average to withstand selling of two issues that had been among Monday's better performers: International Paper, which dropped 1 5/8 to 55 3/8, and Westinghouse Electric, which fell 2 1/4 to 70.    Elsewhere in the technology sector, Wang Laboratories Class B advanced 1 1/8 to 6 7/8 in American Stock Exchange trading of 2.8 million shares. Frederick A. Wang, son of founder An Wang, resigned as president and chief operating officer.    Other issues in the group were mixed, in contrast to Monday's broad gain. NCR advanced 1 1/2 to 63 5/8, Data General fell 1/4 to 17 1/8, Hewlett-Packard dropped 1/2 to 57, Cray Research rose 1/2 to 45 1/4, Unisys slipped 1/4 to 21 3/4, and Motorola lost 1 3/8 to 59 7/8.    Similarly, cyclical stocks fell short of repeating their across-the-board gain. Dow Chemical climbed 2 to 97 1/2 on 1.7 million shares, W.R. Grace gained 1 to 34 3/4, and Armco rose 3/4 to 12 7/8 on 1.6 million shares; on the other hand, paper producers' stocks were generally weak, and Monsanto went down 1 3/8 to 118 5/8 while Du Pont fell 1/4 to 119 1/4.    USAir Group dropped 1 5/8 to 51 3/8 after taking steps to reduce the risk of takeover by a group headed by investor Michael Steinhardt. The company sold preferred stock convertible to a 12% stake to Berkshire Hathaway, controlled by investor Warren Buffett, expanded a stock purchase program and said it is considering an employee stock ownership plan.    Takeover fever continued elsewhere in the airline group, however. Apart from UAL's continued surge, Midway Airlines rose 1 1/2 to 20 1/2; Ampco-Pittsburgh said it has a 6.6% stake in the company and may seek control. Delta Air Lines advanced 2 1/4 to 76 3/4, and AMR, which owns American Airlines, gained 2 3/8 to 73 7/8.    Selected thrift issues rallied on further speculative buying, tied to provisions in bailout legislation that allow commercial banks to acquire healthy thrifts immediately. HomeFed surged 4 1/2 to 44, CalFed gained 1 1/2 to 28, GlenFed went up 1 3/8 to 24, Dime Savings Bank of New York rose 1 5/8 to 16 1/4, and Downey Savings andamp; Loan Association added 7/8 to 28 7/8.    Hilton Hotels rose 1 1/8 to 107 7/8 amid rumors that its board plans to meet tomorrow. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report they believe the board will give its investment bankers clearance to pursue a possible sale of the company.    Stocks of other casino operators posted gains as well. Holiday rose 5/8 to 70, Circus Circus Enterprises advanced 3/4 to 44 1/2, and Caesars World gained 1 3/4 to 39 3/4.    Paramount Communications climbed 2 5/8 to 59 5/8 on rumors that Chris-Craft Industries may use proceeds from the imminent sale of its stake in Warner Communications for a takeover attempt. Paramount declined to comment. Some other entertainment stocks also reversed recent slumps; Walt Disney jumped 4 5/8 to 119 3/8, and MCA rose 1 5/8 to 68 7/8.    Wal-Mart Stores fell 1 3/4 to 41 3/8 on two million shares as the retailer's second-quarter earnings report proved disappointing. Analysts at PaineWebber and Bear Stearns said they may lower their estimates of fiscal-year earnings.    Artra Group added 1 3/8 to 22 7/8. The company reached an agreement to sell a major part of its Sargent-Welch Scientific operations to a unit of VWR. Terms weren't disclosed.    The American Stock Exchange Index set another record, gaining 1.78 to 380.96. Volume totaled 16,350,000 shares, compared with 13,120,000 Monday. There were 296 issues advancing, 301 declining and 268 unchanged.    OMI rose 3/8 to 9 3/4. The company reported improved second-quarter earnings and said it expects to post pretax gains totaling $17 million in the third and fourth quarters from tanker sales. </TEXT></DOC>
