EDITS thereafter to trim.^By PETER ENG</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vietnam will withdraw 50,000 troopsfrom Cambodia by the end of the year and will pull out all itsforces by 1990, the official Cambodian SPK news agency said today.   The Soviet news agency Tass, reporting from Hanoi, also reportedthe pullout announcement.   SPK quoted a communique from the Ministry of National Defense assaying the soldiers would be returning home from June to December.   Remaining troops will be placed under the command of thepro-Vietnamese Cambodian government, SPK said.   A 50,000-troop pullout would be by far the largest of sixpartial withdrawals Vietnam claims to have made since 1982.   About 20,000 troops returned home in the most recent and largestwithdrawal last November. The United States says that was the onlygenuine withdrawal, and it estimates that 120,000-125,000Vietnamese troops remain in the country battling about 50,000guerrillas.   SPK, monitored in Bangkok, said that over the past nine years,the Cambodian government ``has gradually undertaken the defensework by itself, thus creating the conditions for six annualwithdrawals of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Kampuchea(Cambodia).''   ``This time, the command of the Vietnamese volunteer army inKampuchea will also be pulled out from Kampuchea and the remainingVietnamese troops in Kampuchea are to be placed under the commandof the People's Republic of Kampuchea until their completewithdrawal in 1990.''   The announcement followed word on the Vietnamese pullout by asenior Vietnamese Foreign Ministry official Wednesday to a group offoreign diplomats in Hanoi, a Western diplomat in Bangkok saidtoday.   The diplomat, quoting a cable from his country's embassy inHanoi, said he had no other details. He gave the information oncondition of anonymity.   The development came before Sunday's start of the Moscow summit,at which President Reagan has said he will ask Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev to encourage the Vietnamese to resolve theCambodian conflict.   The Soviet-armed Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978 andare fighting guerrillas backed militarily or diplomatically byChina, non-communist Southeast Asian countries and the UnitedStates.   Hanoi had warned it will take unspecified action if theguerrillas take advantage of the pullout to try to return to power.   The strategy of the Khmer Rouge, the largest of the guerrillagroups, has been to gain control of villages and wait for theVietnamese to withdraw in 1990.   The Western diplomat said the Vietnamese were moving into theinterior of the country, leaving the Phnom Penh forces to guard theThai border area, the traditional area of fighting.   Earlier this week, Reagan said in response to written questionsfrom reporters from Southeast Asian countries that he would raisethe Cambodian issue in Moscow.   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand quoted SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze as telling him last week inMoscow that the Kremlin would talk to the Vietnamese about endingtheir occupation of Cambodia.   That could represent a significant change of position _ theSoviets previously stated they have no direct role to play in theconflict and that Vietnam is a sovereign country whose policies theKremlin cannot influence.   In exchange for rights at Vietnam's numerous military bases, theSoviet Union gives Vietnam several billion dollars a year in aid.</TEXT></DOC>
