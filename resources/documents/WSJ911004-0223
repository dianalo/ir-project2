Lotus stock continued to fall yesterday after a group of10 law professors filed briefs with the U.S. District Courtin Boston supporting aspects of Borland's case. Their brieffollowed a similar brief filed Monday by the U.S. CopyrightOffice.</LP><TEXT>   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Lotusclosed at $26.75, down $2.50 for the day and down $5.25 forthe week. Borland, also traded over the counter, closed at$49.75, up 25 cents.   &quot;Before this, the consensus view was that Lotus wouldwin,&quot; said W. Christopher Mortensen, a software analyst withAlex. Brown andamp; Sons. &quot;These briefs raise doubts whether it'sthat cut and dried.&quot; He added, &quot;I think Borland still has anuphill battle, but this shows that at least they have somefriends.&quot;   The professors include copyright experts Ralph S. Brown ofYale Law School, Pamela Samuelson of University of Pittsburghand Peter S. Menell of Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.They argued that Judge Robert Keeton used &quot;an overbroad testin assessing the copyrightability of the Lotus 1-2-3 userinterface,&quot; in a previous ruling. They added that his test&quot;has an adverse effect on the development of copyrightdoctrine {and} on software development and the softwareindustry.&quot;   Lotus's 1-2-3 software has long dominated the spreadsheetsoftware market. Lotus sued Borland in July 1990 chargingthat an optional feature of Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheetthat made it work the same way as 1-2-3 was a violation ofLotus's copyright. The suit was brought before Judge Keeton,who had just ruled that Lotus's copyright had been violatedby Paperback Software International's VP Planner, a &quot;clone&quot;spreadsheet that mimicked both the appearance and the commandstructure of 1-2-3.   The latest flurry of briefs was filed in response toLotus's motion for a summary judgment in the case. Borlandhas publicized them in news releases and telephoneconferences with reporters and analysts.   A Lotus spokesman said, &quot;We feel it's unlikely that thecourt will embrace the point of view of these professors thatit rejected a year ago,&quot; in the Paperback case. &quot;We remainconfident we will prevail in court.&quot;   Lee Gesmer, a Boston lawyer who specializes in technologylaw, said, &quot;These arguments aren't new. I can't imagine anyreason {Judge Keeton} will find them more persuasive now&quot;than he did when he rejected them in the Paperback case. Mr.Gesmer noted that it is unusual for plaintiffs to seekfriend-of-the-court briefs in district court cases and hespeculated that &quot;it may offend the judge&quot; that Borland haspublicized them in the press.   Gary Reback, an attorney representing Borland, a ScottsValley, Calif., company, said: &quot;We think Judge Keeton will beenormously interested in what these other distinguishedprofessors have to say.&quot;   The professors' brief argued that the organization andstructure of Lotus's commands, which Judge Keeton ruled wereviolated by Paperback, aren't necessarily subject toprotection by copyright. They said patent law is moreappropriate for such functional concepts.   Mr. Mortensen of Alex. Brown said Borland may haveconceded &quot;we'll never change Judge Keeton's mind, but atleast we're building a case for appeal.&quot;   Well-heeled Borland will inevitably appeal the case if itloses. It has sold one million copies of Quattro Pro andanalysts have estimated that Lotus could win damages of $10million to $100 million. The Paperback verdict was neverappealed because financially strapped Paperback settled thedamages portion of the case by paying Lotus $500,000 andcanceling sale of its product.</TEXT></DOC>
