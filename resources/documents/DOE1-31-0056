<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-31-0056 </DOCNO><TEXT>The standard sequence of the Cenozoic sediments hidden under the OsakaPlain was made clear by the deep drilling OD-2 and OD-1 performed inthe period of 1963 to 1967. The OD-1 and OD-2 cores obtained in the Osaka,Infra-Osaka and Kobe Groups were investigatd. The lithologic featureof the Kobe and Infra-Osaka Groups is very similar to that of the lowerand the lowermost parts of Osaka Group distributed in the hilly landsurrounding the Osaka Plain. Pollen assemblage of the Infra-Osaka andKobe Groups in the OD-2 core is characterized by the occurrence of Diploxylon,Picea, Abies, Tsuga and Taxodianeae, and the absence of Carya and Nyssa.Fission track age of volcanic ash which is intercalated in the Kobe Groupof the OD-2 core is 1.84 + 0.20 Ma. As a result of this study, the strataformerly regarded as belonging to the Kobe and Osaka Groups are excludedfrom these groups, and now referred to the lower and the lowermost partsof the Osaka Group.
