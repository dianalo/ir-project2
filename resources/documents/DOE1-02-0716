Our framework for achieving this goalis based on the types of data commonly available from both laboratoryand field studies. One of the models (PHALCA) in this framework estimatesthe number of fish surviving as a function of time, given pH, Al, andCa levels. A second model (FISHEGGS) evaluates the reduction in reproductivepotential of a fish population attributable to the effects of pH, Al,and Ca on the survival of young-of-the-year and older fish and on fecundity.Preliminary results from these two models are presented, and the entireframework will be applied and tested over the next year using data forbrook trout and lakes in the Adirondacks. The framework and models area complementary alternative to the statistical analysis of survey dataon water chemistry and on presence or absence of a fish species.</TEXT></DOC>
