Reynolds Tobacco Company.The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty(60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments receivedand will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make finalthe agreement's proposed order.According to the Complaint issued by the Commission in this proceeding,R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (``Reynolds'') published an advertisemententitled ``Of cigarettes and science.'' This advertisement discussed inthe context of a larger discussion about how science is supposed to work,a scientific study known as the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial(MR FIT). According to the complaint, the advertisement invited consumersto consider and question the relationship that they had been told existsbetween smoking and heart disease. The complaint alleged that Reynolds'advertisement contained three false or misleading representations aboutthe MR FIT study: (1) That MR FIT was designed and performed to test whethercigarette smoking causes coronary heart disease; (2) that MR FIT providescredible scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous as the publicor the reader has been lead to believe; and (3) that MR FIT tends to refutethe theory that smoking causes coronary heart disease. That complaint alsoalleged that, in light of the representations contained in the advertisement,it was a deceptive practice for Reynolds to fail to disclose certain factsabout the study and the lower risk from coronary heart disease in men whoquit smoking.Under the terms of the proposed consent order, Reynolds must cease anddesist from making the three representations identified in the complaint.Moreover, in any discussion of the MR FIT study that questions the relationshipbetween smoking and smokers' risk of coronary heart disease, Reynolds mustdisclose that: (1) The men in the study who quit smoking had a significantlylower rate of coronary disease death than men who continued to smoke; or(2) the study results are consistent with previous studies showing thatthose who quit smoking enjoy a substantial decrease in death from coronaryheart disease. Finally, Reynolds must cease and desist from misrepresentingthe results, design, purpose or content of any explicitly referred to scientifictest or study concerning any claimed association between cigarette smokingand chronic or acute health effects. This final provision does not applyto certain statements of Reynolds' opinion or to representations aboutthe amount of tar and nicotine in cigarettes.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedorder. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of theagreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
