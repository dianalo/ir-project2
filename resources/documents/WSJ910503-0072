Chairman Rand Araskog'scompensation level, is further underscoring its disapprovalby voting against the company's directors at next week'sannual meeting.   Dale M. Hanson, chief executive officer of theorganization, known as Calpers, said &quot;the huge amount ofcompensation that ITT's board has awarded its {chiefexecutive} . . . despite what we consider to be quitemediocre performance, compelled us to express our displeasurein some tangible way.&quot; Calpers owns 1,149,150 shares, orabout 1%, of ITT's shares outstanding.</LP><TEXT>   As previously reported, ITT rewarded Mr. Araskog with a63% pay raise last year, plus incentive payments andperquisites that brought his total remuneration to $7.3million. During the year, the company's stock price sank 18%.   In a statement, ITT defended Mr. Araskog's pay and said itrespects and recognizes Calpers' right to vote on the issuesany way it chooses. The board's compensation committee, withthe counsel of outside compensation consultants, &quot;believesthe chairman's compensation is entirely appropriate in lightof his performance and accomplishments.&quot; ITT added that basedon proxies received so far, shareholders have overwhelminglyvoted in favor of the slate of directors.   Calpers' decision represents another blow for ITT, whichhas become something of a symbol this year of increasingshareholder concern about the perceived disparity betweenexecutive pay and the company's performance. Mr. Araskog's1990 pay has been the subject of several articles infinancial and business publications.   Moreover, the negative vote represents a failure by ITT todisarm the growing controversy. Executives of the companytraveled to California, where Calpers is based, earlier thisweek to explain the company's position and presumably topersuade Calpers to cast a favorable vote for the company'sslate. The annual meeting is scheduled for Tuesday inLeominster, Mass.   While Calpers was encouraged by the meeting, Mr. Hansonsaid, &quot;to expect us to simply ignore the board's actionsduring 1990 and during the preceding several years was simplyasking us to make too great a leap of faith.&quot;   In announcing its decision yesterday, Calpers calculatedthat Mr. Araskog earned total compensation, excluding fringebenefits, of $30 million during the four years ending in1990. It said Mr. Araskog's pay package during the period wasmore than double the &quot;going rate&quot; for comparable chiefexecutives based on company size and performance.</TEXT></DOC>
