Statistics seem to back their claims. In the first half of1991, federal prosecutors brought 42 indictments under theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, theJustice Department says. These included nine cases involvingwhite-collar defendants. That's about the same rate as in1990, when there were 91 RICO indictments, 20 in white-collarcases.</LP><TEXT>   In Chicago, Los Angeles, Newark, N.J., and elsewhere, thetravails of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who have beenreversed in a spate of RICO cases and other white-collarprosecutions, seem far away -- and of little relevance. Thisis largely because the cases were reversed on narrow legal orprocedural grounds, without repudiating RICO itself.   &quot;If white-collar institutions believe criminal RICO is onthe ropes, they are sadly mistaken,&quot; says Michael Goldsmith,a law professor at Brigham Young University and the vicechairman of the American Bar Association's committee on RICO.&quot;There's no indication at all of a trend to throw out RICOcases.&quot;   RICO, enacted by Congress in 1970 to battle organizedcrime, calls for harsh penalties for anyone engaging in apattern of serious crimes through some business ororganization. The law first caught the attention of thebusiness community four years ago when Rudolph Giuliani, thenU.S. Attorney in Manhattan, began to use it in Wall Streetfraud investigations.   The law allows judges to freeze a defendant's assetsbefore trial and, after conviction, to order the forfeitureof the money or property the defendant acquired throughcriminal activity. Defense lawyers have attacked RICO asonerous and unfair, saying it penalizes defendants beforeguilt has been proved and coerces them into plea bargainseven if they are innocent. A separate civil provision of thelaw, which allows private parties to sue for racketeering andextract triple damages, has also been criticized.   RICO indictments, which also carry the threat of 20-yearprison terms, helped extract settlements of criminal chargesinvolving Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its junk-bondimpresario, Michael Milken, among other ex-Drexel officials.And RICO convictions were won in cases involvingPrinceton/Newport L.P., the Wedtech Corp.government-influence scandal and several other bigprosecutions.   In late May, however, the federal appeals court inManhattan reversed all convictions in the Wedtech-relatedtrial of E. Robert Wallach, former adviser to ex-AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese. In early June, the appeals courtoverturned the RICO convictions of eight defendants in amassive organized-crime case. A few weeks later, the courtthrew out the racketeering convictions in thePrinceton/Newport case -- the government's first use of RICOagainst the partners of a securities firm.   The reversals have left an impression that Mr. Giuliani'soffice may have used RICO too freely. Still, prosecutors anddefense lawyers agree, in none of the reversals did theappellate judges make any broad determination that RICO wasinappropriate in white-collar cases. Indeed, the SupremeCourt has already affirmed that RICO can be used outside theorganizedcrime arena, and recent appeals court rulings havedealt with narrower questions.   In the Wallach case, the appeals court said the RICOcharges were &quot;legally sufficient&quot; but overturned theconviction because a key government witness lied to the jury.In the organized-crime case, the appeals court criticized thelong, costly &quot;megatrials&quot; that sometimes result from RICOcases because of the large number of defendants. But itdidn't say there was anything inherently unfair about suchcases.   Only in the Princeton/Newport case did the appellatejudges question the appropriateness of using RICO -- and thenonly in cases involving tax fraud. In its opinion, the courtnoted that the Justice Department in 1989 issued guidelinesdiscouraging the use of RICO in tax cases.   Robert S. Mueller III, assistant attorney general for theJustice Department's criminal division, says, &quot;A reversal ofa RICO conviction on a non-RICO issue is often mistaken as ajudicial criticism of RICO when it is actually no suchcriticism at all.&quot; He adds that reversals related solely tothe RICO law have been extremely rare. He said RICOconvictions over a broad range of crimes have recently beenupheld by federal appeals courts in Boston, Chicago andPhiladelphia.   Michael Chertoff, chief federal prosecutor in Newark,N.J., adds, &quot;The argument that RICO is an unfair statute isbelied by the fact that you do see some mixed verdicts. If itwere an unfair law, we would win every case, and if it wereunworkable we'd lose every case.&quot; In the past 18 months, theNewark U.S. Attorney's office has won RICO convictions in abroad range of cases, including insurance fraud, pensionfraud, political corruption and penny stock fraud.   Among recent RICO cases in Los Angeles was that of JanetFaye McKinzie, charged with looting the now-defunct NorthAmerica Savings andamp; Loan. In March 1990, Ms. McKinzie wasconvicted of conspiracy, racketeering, bank fraud and wirefraud. She was sentenced to 20 years and ordered to payrestitution of more than $13 million. An appeal is pending.   In Chicago, prosecutors have used RICO to fightcommodities fraud, insider trading and political corruption.In 1988, the Chicago U.S. Attorney's office broughtracketeering charges for the first time ever in an insidertrading prosecution. The defendant, Alfred Elliott, a formerlawyer, was convicted in 1989 and sentenced to five years inprison as well as $600,000 in fines and forfeitures. Therewas no appeal. The Chicago office's many RICO convictions incases involving lawyers accused of bribing public officialswere upheld on appeal. And more recently, eight of 10defendants charged with racketeering in Chicago's bigcommodities fraud cases were convicted; one pleaded guilty;and another was acquitted. Appeals are pending.   Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence Rosenthal inChicago says RICO has served well as a deterrent. &quot;Interviewany group of investment bankers and ask if they are aware ofthe recent prosecutions, of the criminal sentences, and ifthey don't think more about their own conduct now,&quot; says Mr.Rosenthal. &quot;Five years from now, you'll see a similar thingin bank fraud and the Sandamp;L prosecutions. You bring in theheavy artillery, and it works, so why stop using it?&quot;   The number of RICO cases in the U.S. Attorney's office inManhattan has stayed steady. So far this year, the office hasbegun six RICO cases, compared with seven in all of 1990 andnine in 1989.   Nonetheless, criminal lawyers who practice in New Yorksuspect that fewer RICO cases involving Wall Streetwrongdoing will be brought there, mostly because the new U.S.Attorney, Otto Obermaier, has been less aggressive than Mr.Giuliani in pursuing securities-related cases. A spokeswomanfor Mr. Obermaier, who succeeded Mr. Giuliani in 1989, saidthe office would have no comment.</TEXT></DOC>
