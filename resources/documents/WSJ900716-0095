The vote this timewill be close. But even if it passes, the danger is thewinning amendment will treat the symptoms of deficit spendingwithout applying the needed cure: effective restraints onspending.   Democratic House leaders bottled up the balanced-budgetamendment in committee for years, even though this year asolid majority of 249 Members sponsored it. The only chanceof getting a vote in the full House was to persuade 218Members to sign a discharge petition bringing it to thefloor. Enough Members were leery of offending House leadersthat the petition languished.</LP><TEXT>   The amendment finally broke free last month when GOP Rep.Chuck Douglas threatened to reveal the names of thoseco-sponsors who were hypocritically refusing to sign thedischarge petition. There was a sudden rush of Members tosign it.   However, all balanced-budget amendments are not madeequal, and there are sharp differences between the twoversions to be voted on tomorrow. Members will first vote ona proposal by Texas GOP Rep. Joe Barton, which requires abalanced budget unless three-fifths of Congress agrees to adeficit. Increases in government revenues would be limited tothe growth of national income, similar to the Gann limit thatcurbs spending in California. A three-fifths vote of Congresswould be needed to raise the limit.   After the Barton amendment, Members will vote on one byGOP Rep. Larry Craig and Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm. Itwould not explicitly restrain government spending, andrequires only a majority of both Houses to balance the budgetthrough higher taxes. Only the one with the most votes goeson for a final up-or-down floor vote.   We have always been skeptical of how much abalanced-budget amendment could restrain the spending habitsof a wily Congress. Members are expert at creating off-budgetspending, and the 1974 Budget Act, which was supposed to curbspending, has been waived by Congress 398 times in the pastdecade. We've felt there was as much chance that an amendmentwould lead to higher taxes as it would curb spending.   Even so, we recognize that tomorrow's vote is an importantone. Here is a short guide to determine the extent to whichyour representative is serious about controlling the size ofgovernment:   If a Member votes for both the Barton and Craig-Stenholmamendments, he or she clearly wants to impose restraints onhow much of the taxpayer's money Congress can take. A voteagainst both amendments is a clear endorsement of thetax-tax-spend-spend mentality. But if a Member votes againstthe Barton amendment and for the Craig-Stenholm amendment,they are trying to snow the voters. In effect, they aretelling them they want to limit government borrowing, whilethey oppose the amendment that restrains the spending machinethat creates the need for borrowing.   The Barton amendment is too cumbersome for our tastes,although we doubt that will be the basis of many votes castfor or against it. But at least it recognizes that thefundamental problem facing the country is not primarily thesize of the deficit, but the total resources the governmentextracts from the private sector as spending. TheCraig-Stenholm approach makes attempts to raise taxes morevisible, but doesn't do enough to make it more difficult topass them into law. Members who support it, but not theBarton amendment, should be in for some tough questions fromvoters this fall.</TEXT></DOC>
