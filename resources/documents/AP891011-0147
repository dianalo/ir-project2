Robert Garcia and his wife used theWedtech Corp. like a personal bank, trading the congressman'spolitical influence for payoffs and interest-free loans, aprosecutor charged Wednesday.   ``The Garcias were greedy. They wanted something more from thisoffice than the satisfaction of doing good for the public,'' saidAssistant U.S. Attorney Michele Hirshman in closing arguments atthe Garcias' bribery and extortion trial.   ``In doing so, they corrupted it, abused it, misused it, soldit,'' she said.   The defense painted a different picture in its summation,telling the 12 jurors in Manhattan federal court to acquit theGarcias by rejecting testimony from the prosecution's star witness,former Wedtech vice chairman Mario Moreno.   ``There are many reasons to doubt Moreno's testimony _ reasonsbased on lies, told and untold crimes and his willingness to doanything to evade justice,'' said Ronald Fischetti, the lawyer forJane Lee Garcia.   Fischetti said Moreno, who pleaded guilty to theft- andbribe-related charges in 1987 and testified at other Wedtechtrials, was a ``perjurer, liar and thief.''   Garcia, a 56-year-old Bronx Democrat, and his wife are accusedof conspiring to obtain $185,000 in checks and interest-free loans,and a diamond and emerald necklace for Mrs. Garcia, from officialsof the now-defunct Wedtech Corp.   Their trial is the last of several to stem from the scandal atWedtech, the small South Bronx machine shop that grew into amultimillion-dollar defense contractor through various bribeschemes. The company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations ofcorruption.   Hirshman said the relationship between Garcia and Wedtechstarted out legitimately, with the congressman using his influenceto help Wedtech secure government contracts.   This changed, she said, when financial problems prompted theGarcias to seek money from Wedtech. The prosecutor said theirdealings turned into extortion in May 1984 when the congressmantold Moreno that his power in the House was growing and then askedhim to hire his wife.   When Moreno balked, saying it would be improper, Mrs. Garciasuggested the payments be made through a lawyer friend in PuertoRico, Ralph Vallone, Hirshman said.   The prosecution claims that in 1984 through 1986, Wedtech sentVallone $86,100 of which $76,000 was transferred to Mrs. Garcia'sconsulting firm.   Fischetti said he did not dispute that Mrs. Garcia receivedmoney from Vallone, but he claims the payments were for workunrelated to Wedtech.   Fischetti said the prosecution had presented no evidence tosupport Moreno's testimony about the alleged extortion and bribery.``There is no corroboration of illegal acts.''   After the Vallone payments began, Hirshman said Garcia helpedWedtech obtain a lucrative contract with the U.S. Postal Service,``something he should have done without getting paid.''   She said their financial problems continued in 1985, so theGarcias returned to ``their local cash machine, the Wedtech Corp.''for a $20,000 loan.   Garcia instructed Moreno to make the check out to his sister,Aimee Cortese, and she transferred the money to Mrs. Garcia'saccount, Hirshman said.   ``If this was a legitimate loan, why is Mario Moreno being toldto make the check out to Aimee Cortese?'' she asked.   Closing arguments will continue through Thursday when U.S.District Judge Leonard Sand will instruct the jury. Deliberationsare expected to begin Friday.   The Garcias have pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy,extortion, bribery and accepting illegal gratuities. If convictedof the most serious charge, extortion, they would face up to 20years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
