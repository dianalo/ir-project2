Thesemen and women control the world. They devour the rain forest;they manufacture the cars that pump millions of tons ofcarbon dioxide into the atmosphere; they own the coal, gas,oil and factories of the world.   To get away from all these wealth-creating &quot;resources&quot;would be inconceivable, for what would thecapitalists/industrialists do? They have built a megamachineon the very specifications of a greenhouse Earth. Theyeducate millions of young students in the wisdom of thisearth-heating, destructive, suicidal system.   These same earth-heating technocrats have also beentelling the Third World that &quot;development&quot; means to do whatthey did: Industrialize everything: force the peasants offthe land and create mechanical cash monocultures; sell trees,bananas, coffee, vanilla, cacao, oil palm, beef and oil tothe &quot;developed&quot; North and with the money import TVs, luxurygoods like big cars, and machine guns to kill the peasantguerrillas who cause trouble.</TEXT></DOC>
