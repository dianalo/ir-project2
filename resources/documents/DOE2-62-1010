The authors introduce a normalizationmethod to fix the positions of the broadcast sources so that the deriveddesign can be further transformed by retimings into a systolic array.The authors' method is fully illustrated in designing systolic arraysfor enumeration sort, solving simultaneous linear equations, and computingtransitive closure.</TEXT></DOC>
