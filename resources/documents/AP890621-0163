The court, by a 6-3 vote, limited states' power to punish thereporting of truthful information that is lawfully obtained. Thethree dissenting justices criticized the court in a strongly wordedopinion for hampering efforts to protect the privacy of sex-crimevictims.   Florida law makes it a crime to ``print, publish or broadcast''the names of victims of sexual crime.   The Florida Star, a weekly newspaper in Jacksonville, published arape victim's name in its Oct. 29, 1983, police report.   The name had been obtained from a report posted, apparently bymistake, in the press room of the Duval County Sheriff's Department.   Most news organizations, including The Florida Star, havepolicies against publication of rape victim's names. The name of thewoman, identified in court records as B.J.F., was publishedinadvertently, the newpaper's lawyers said.   Relying on the state law, the rape victim sued and won the$97,500 award, which threatened to put the 18,000-circulation paperout of business. Her suit also named the sheriff's department as adefendant, but she was paid $2,500 in a pre-trial settlement.   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said the awardviolated free-press rights protected by the Constitution's FirstAmendment.   However, the ruling did not preclude the possibility that statesmay punish those who publish the name of a sex-crime victim.   ``We do not hold that truthful publication is automaticallyconstitutionally protected, or that there is no zone of privacywithin which the state may protect the individual from intrusion bythe press,'' Marshall wrote.   ``We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthfulinformation which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfullybe imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a stateinterest of the highest order.''   That interest was not present in the Florida case, Marshall said.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra DayO'Connor and Byron R. White dissented.   ``I would find a place to draw the line higher on the hillside: aspot high enough to protect B.J.F.'s desire for privacy and peace ofmind in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy,'' said White,writing for the three.   ``There is no public interest in publishing the names, addressesand phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime _ and nopublic interest in immunizing the press from liability in the rarecases where a state's efforts to protect a victim's privacy havefailed,'' he said.   White noted that the woman's name was published a week after theassault, before her assailant had been arrested.   ``As a result, B.J.F. received harassing phone calls, requiredmental health counseling, was forced to move from her home, and waseven threatened with being raped again,'' he said.   Eric O. Simpson, publisher of The Florida Star, said he waspleased with Wednesday's decision.   ``We were being denied to publish the truth,'' Simpson said. ``Itconstituted prior restraint.''   Simpson said that if the award had been upheld it might have ledto laws restricting the reporting of names of victims of other typesof crimes.   ``A person being raped is no worse than a person being killed,''he said.   Marshall's opinion noted past high court decisions on ``theconflict between truthful reporting and state-protected privacyinterests.''   The court in 1975 barred states from imposing sanctions for thepublication of truthful information _ a rape victim's name _contained in official court records open to public inspection.   A 1977 decision struck down a state law that barred the newsmedia from publishing the name or photograph of an 11-year-old boyin connection with a juvenile court proceeding reporters hadattended.   And in 1979, the court invalidated a state law that made it acrime for newspapers to publish, without written approval of ajuvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender_ even if that information were obtained lawfully.   Marshall's opinion was joined by Justices William J. Brennan,Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. JusticeAntonin Scalia concurred in the result.</TEXT></DOC>
