Standardized methods for buildupremoval tested on a commercial scale in the power plants are comparativelyevaluated. Scaling in the boiler heat exchange system is investigated.Using hydrofluoric acid for scale removal is discussed. Concentrationof hydrofluoric acid ranges from 1.5% to 2.0%. Ryphalgan and Kaptax areused as corrosion inhibitors. Syntron B is also used for scale removalduring boiler operation (at a pressure to 6.4% and temperature below270 C). Efficiency of scale removal using various reagents is discussed.4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
