Background</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 26, 1984 (49 FR 37916), the EPAissued a proposal to modify its registration procedures contained in 40CFR Part 162. These procedures were originally promulgated in 1975 in responseto amendments to FIFRA in 1972, and applied to a broad range of pesticideregulatory actions authorized or affected by that legislation, includingpesticide registration and classification. In succeeding years, as additionalmaterial was added to Part 162, it grew in volume and complexity.The 1984 proposal was the first comprehensive revision of the 1975 regulations.One main purpose of the revision was to reorganize the material to eliminateoverlapping, redundant, or obsolete requirements, and to make them clearerand more useful to applicants and registrants. A second objective was toupdate the requirements to conform to legislative changes since 1975, andto include policy and procedural changes that had evolved in that period.The Agency believes that the final rule responds to these needs, and willbenefit the Agency, pesticide producers, and the public by clearly settingout policies and procedures.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 3, 1985 (50 FR 40408), the Agencyissued a proposal to establish criteria for the ``flagging'' by registrantsor applicants of pesticide data they submit to the Agency, to indicatethat the data contain significant information concerning potential adverseeffects. The proposal would modify existing Part 158, and also parts ofPart 152 as proposed in 1984. Comments on that proposal have been consideredand are addressed in this document. Parts 158 and 152 as promulgated todaycontain the revisions proposed on October 3, 1985.The regulations adopted here are an integral part of a larger set of regulationsaddressing pesticide regulatory activities, all of which have been organizedto be comprehensive and complementary. Individual elements of the pesticideregulatory scheme have been segregated and are presented in separate Partsfor easy understanding:1. Part 152 sets out Federal pesticide registration procedures in theirentirety. Procedures for State registration of pesticides under FIFRA sec.24(c) have been retained as Part 162, Subpart D.2. Part 153 contains general policies pertaining to registration or registeredproducts, but distinct from the registration process itself. Today's finalrule promulgates Subparts G, H and M of Part 153, concerning (a) declarationof certain ingredients as inert; (b) coloration/discoloration of pesticideproducts; and (c) devices. Additional Subparts A and D, concerning, respectively,pesticide advertising and reporting of adverse effects data have been proposed,but have not been made final.3. Part 154, promulgated on November 27, 1985 (50 FR 49015), describesthe Agency's Special Review process in its entirety.4. Part 155, promulgated the same day (50 FR 49001), discusses the publicparticipation procedures associated with the development and issuance ofRegistration Standards.5. Part 156, which was proposed on September 26, 1984, revises labelingrequirements for pesticides and devices, currently located in andSection;162.10.Today's rule document redesignates andSection; 162.10 as andSection; 156.10,retaining current requirements until the revised rules are promulgated.6. Part 157, promulgated on June 11, 1986 (51 FR 21286), contains requirementsfor the packaging of pesticide products, currently limited to child-resistantpackaging.7. Part 158, promulgated on October 24, 1984 (49 FR 42881), contains datarequirements applicable to pesticide products.Each of these addresses a single regulatory topic, process or function,and can be used independently of the others.In response to its 1984 proposal, the Agency received 30 comments. Commentersincluded individual pesticide producers, trade associations, user groups,an environmental group, and a Federal agency. The significant commentsare addressed in Units III through XVIII and XX of this preamble. In responseto its 1985 proposal, the Agency received 10 comments. These are addressedin Unit XIX of this preamble.As part of its 1984 document, the Agency proposed to establish Part 157,containing regulations governing child-resistant packaging requirementsfor pesticides. Readers should note that the Agency has separately promulgatedthese regulations in final form, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 11, 1986 (51 FR 21276). Comments pertainingto child-resistant packaging of pesticides have been addressed in thatfinal rule, and are not repeated here.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Definitions</ITAG>A. Acute LD-50The Agency proposed definitions for ``acute oral LD <T2>50</T2>,'' ``acute dermal LD<T2>50</T2>,'' and ``acute inhalation LC<T2>50</T2>,'' which defined these values as ``statistically derived estimates''of the single dose (or concentration) that would cause mortality to 50percent of the test species. Several commenters stated that the definitionsare inconsistent with the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, in that a statisticallyderived estimate requires a study using three dosage levels, while thePesticide Assessment Guidelines permit the use of a single dosage ``limittest'' if it shows no mortality. They believe that the proposed definitionprecludes the use of the limits test.EPA disagrees. The definitions are exactly the same as those containedin the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines themselves and are correct definitionsfor the terms. The use of these definitions in the Guidelines has not raisedsimilar concerns among data developers, and the definitions have co-existedwith the limits tests since the Guidelines were issued. Thus the definitionsare not incompatible with the Pesticide Guidelines or the limits test.EPA strongly supports the use of the limits test in defining acute toxicitylimits, because its single dosage regimen can significantly reduce thenumber of test animals used. EPA also attempts to evaluate pesticides usingdata from structurally similar chemicals when appropriate. If classic acutetoxicity studies are nonetheless required, the Agency encourages maximumutilization of the testing to evaluate multiple toxic endpoints ratherthan just simple lethality. The LD50s and LC50s derived from standard acutetoxicity testing are used not only as indicators of acute toxicity (forpurposes of labeling the product), but also serve as rangefinding levelsfor use in subchronic studies and chronic studies that follow.B. Distribute and SellSeven commenters expressed concern at the definition of ``distribute andsell'' in andSection; 152.3(j). In addition to the statutory language concerningdistribution and sale, the definition deemed distribution to have occurredeither when a finished product was both packaged and labeled in the mannerin which it would be shipped or when it was stored in an area where suchfinished products are stored. The Agency's intent was to incorporate thecurrent definition of ``released for shipment'' as part of the definitionof ``distribute and sell.'' The term ``released for shipment'' is usedin FIFRA sec. 9 to define when a product may be inspected for compliancepurposes.According to industry commenters, the Agency's proposed inclusion of thecriteria for ``released for shipment'' would create problems for the industryif it were used to determine whether a product has been introduced intocommerce and thus can be found in violation of FIFRA. All commenters expressedconcern that products which a registrant has not decided to ``release forshipment'' may meet the definition of ``distribute or sell''. Accordingto commenters, the term ``release for shipment'' does not describe an identifiableand uniformly enforceable point in the distribution chain of a product.The commenters said that whether an individual product has been releasedfor shipment depends on the policies of the producer involved, i.e., thata product has been released for shipment when the producer intends thatit be shipped. Unless the producer admits that the product has been releasedfor shipment, they suggest, the product cannot be inspected for compliancepurposes, and therefore cannot be found in violation of FIFRA. Moreover, commenters claim, the proposed definition runs counter to productionand storage practices commonly used in the industry. Finished productsthat have been released for shipment are commonly stored with other productswhich are ``on hold'' for one reason or another. They state that a finishedproduct may be in both ``released for shipment'' and not ``released forshipment'' status, and claim that the proposed definition does not recognizethis distinction. Commenters feared that, if the definition were adopted,products that are on hold might frequently be deemed to have been distributedand sold. EPA disagrees with the statements of commenters that there can be, or shouldbe, a distinction made between products that have been released for shipmentand those that have been deemed to be distributed or sold. A product thathas been released for shipment by its producer is considered to have beendistributed or sold as defined in the Act (which includes holding for sale).A producer cannot reasonably assert that two batches of registered product,identical in packaging and labeling and located in the same area of a warehouseor producing establishment, are different merely because one allegedlyhas been released for shipment and another has not. The Agency, in inspectingfor compliance, will assume that a product that is packaged, labeled, andstored in an area where finished products are normally stored has beenreleased for shipment. The Agency would be severely hampered in its ability to enforce complianceif products released for shipment were not considered to have been distributedand sold, since violations of the Act depend on ``distribution and sale''and not upon ``release for shipment.'' Carried to its practical conclusion,if a product that had been released for shipment, and therefore could beinspected under FIFRA sec. 9, were to be found in violation, the Agencycould not take enforcement action until the product had actually been distributedand sold. If inspection of products released for shipment could not leaddirectly to enforcement action, but must await some further point at whichit had been ``distributed and sold,'' the Agency's enforcement effortswould be thwarted. Consequently, in the final rule, the Agency has included the term ``releasedfor shipment'' in the definition of ``distribute and sell.'' The Agency also considered defining the term ``channels of trade,'' whichhas been used in past Agency documents (without definition) as an informalsynonym for the litany of terms in FIFRA sec. 12 comprising ``distributeand sell.'' EPA considers the two terms synonymous: a product that is beingdistributed and sold by any person is in channels of trade, and vice versa.It is therefore unnecessary to define ``channels of trade'' separately.Moreover, the Agency does not expect to use the term in future regulatorydocuments, but will rather specify the categories of persons who are prohibitedfrom distributing or selling a product. Thus, the registrant may be prohibitedfrom distributing or selling after a certain date, while other persons(e.g., retailers) may be prohibited from distributing or selling aftera second date. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Products Required To Be Registered </ITAG>The Agency proposed to clarify its interpretation of what constitutes apesticide, for purposes of compliance with the registration requirementof FIFRA sec. 3. Section 152.15 proposed to add new language stating thata substance may be intended for a pesticidal purpose (and therefore requiredto be registered) if any of a number of tests are met. The first of theseis whether advertising or product labeling claims, implicitly or explicitly,that the product is a pesticide. This is the principal test contained incurrent regulations. No comments were received on this test, and it hasbeen adopted as proposed. EPA also proposed to treat as a pesticide any substance which has no significantcommercially valuable use other than a pesticidal one. One commenter objectedthat the term ``significant commercially valuable use'' is judgmental.EPA acknowledges that a certain degree of judgment must be exercised indeciding whether a substance meets this definition. On the other hand,the Agency believes that a large percentage, if not the majority, of pesticideactive ingredients are clearly identifiable either as pesticides or asmulti-purpose substances, and that the Agency will rarely be compelledto use this criterion alone to judge whether a substance is a pesticide.The Agency has in the past focused its enforcement efforts on individualproduct claims, and EPA intends to continue this focus. The Agency further proposed, as a third criterion, that if a person knows,or should reasonably know, that he is selling a product for a pesticidalpurpose (even though the product itself bears no pesticidal claims), theproduct should be a pesticide subject to the registration requirement.This criterion would apply primarily to products which are currently notregistered as pesticides (for example, multi-purpose substances havingpesticide uses, but for which a particular product bears no pesticidalclaims.) Nine persons commented upon this provision. Several expressed concern thatthe language was imputing knowledge of pesticidal use and responsibilityto manufacturers who have no control over their distributors and customers.This burden, they state, is unreasonable. Other commenters, while not objectingto the criterion per se, requested that the Agency clarify its intent,and sought reassurance that the criterion would be used for enforcementagainst the person making the claim and not against the producer. Somesuggested that simply deleting the word ``reasonably'' from the criterionwould resolve the problem satisfactorily. In general, commenters believedthat definition was too broad and inclusive. In response, the Agency has clarified the definition by replacing the ``reasonable''knowledge terminology with language concerning ``actual or constructive''knowledge of pesticidal use. Actual or constructive knowledge will be gaugedas objectively as possible. The Agency issued in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 25, 1987 (52 FR 9504) a proposal concerningestablishment registration, which uses the same terminology to describewhen a pesticide producer must register his producing establishment. Inthat document, the Agency described the criteria that it would considerin determining actual or constructive knowledge. These included promotionalclaims and advertising, common knowledge of the general business of theperson to whom the substance is sold, and the commercial distance froma producer to a formulator. The same principles will guide the Agency inapplying the ``actual or constructive knowledge'' test of pesticide forpurposes of registration. The Agency believes the fears of the commenters concerning ``upstream penalties''are unfounded. The Agency does not intend to impose penalties upon theproducer of a non-pesticide product, if, without his knowledge, a pesticidalclaim is made for the product by someone else. EPA agrees that it wouldbe unreasonable to require registration of a product whose primary usesare non-pesticidal merely because a retailer sold the product as a pesticide.On the other hand, EPA believes that a producer who sells a product withfull knowledge of its intended pesticidal use should be held responsiblefor its registration. This situation might apply, for example, when a producersells what would ordinarily be considered a basic chemical to a user whoseonly purpose in acquiring such a chemical would be to use it as a pesticide.If the seller of the product is aware of the nature of his customer's business,EPA may consider him to be selling a product for a pesticidal purpose.EPA acknowledges that application of this criterion for enforcement purposeswill require subjective judgment.The second and third criteria both are intended to address longstandingenforcement problems in which neither labeling nor advertising clearlystates or implies that the product is a pesticide, but the product is soldunder circumstances in which it is clear that the product is intended fora pesticidal purpose. For example, if the ingredients of a well-known woodpreservative mixture are offered for sale (without pesticidal claims) ina trade magazine aimed primarily at wood processors and there is no otherapparent reason for wood processors to be interested in the ingredients,it would not be unreasonable to regard the products as pesticides.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Exemptions</ITAG>A. Exemptions under FIFRA Sec. 25(b)Sections 152.20 and 152.25 describe exemptions based on FIFRA sec. 25(b)for, respectively, products adequately regulated by another Federal agencyand products of a character not requiring FIFRA regulation.One commenter suggested that the exemption for pheromones in andSection;152.25(a) be expanded to include pheromones other than those produced byan arthropod. Paragraph (a)(1) of that section defines a pheromone as acompound produced by arthropods. The Agency declines to adopt the commenter'ssuggestion. The Agency is not aware that pheromones produced by other animalsare registered with the Agency. EPA was able to exempt arthropod pheromonesbased on information it possessed in its files on such products. Althoughthe Agency may choose to exempt such pheromones in the future (and wouldprobably adopt the commenter's suggestion concerning revision of the definitionif it does so), it does not choose to do so prospectively in the absenceof information concerning their characteristics and effects.Two commenters requested that an additional exemption be added to andSection;152.25 for preservatives used in ``non-FDA regulated products,'' when usedat levels consistent with Food and Drug clearances for drugs and cosmetics.The commenters stated that exemption would make available a greater varietyof preservatives for use in household products.It is not clear to the Agency what exemption is being proposed or for whatpreservatives. It appears that the commenters' concern is that the availabilityof preservatives for use in consumer products is limited because such preservativesare required to be registered as pesticides. The implication is that producersof some preservatives suitable for use in these products are unwillingto undertake the registration process for what is presumably a limitedmarket. The commenter further suggests that if FDA-regulated preservativeswere not required to be regulated under FIFRA, producers of preservativeproducts would make more of them available.Although the commenters' suggestion may have merit in certain situations,it is not specific enough for the Agency to act on in this final rule.The commenters provided proposed language for an exemption, but it wasworded so broadly and ambiguously that EPA cannot properly evaluate it.No specific preservatives were mentioned, only those ``used by the cosmeticand drug industry.'' Moreover, no levels or limits were indicated or evenreferred to; the proposed language simply stated ``in amounts consistentwith those `used in FDA regulated products.' '' EPA would be willing toentertain proposals for exemption of specific preservatives at specificlevels, but is not willing to grant the blanket exemption suggested bythe commenters.In andSection; 152.20(a)(3) of the final rule, the Agency has made a minortechnical change. That section provides an exemption from FIFRA requirementsfor certain types of living organisms, except as provided. The list ofexceptions (organisms that are not exempt) has been modified to use currentterminology. The Agency is currently reviewing this exemption and its implicationsin light of recent advances in biotechnology. If changes in the exemptionor new policies evolve from the Agency's review, this section may be modifiedafter notice and comment.B. Contract ManufacturingThe Agency proposed two changes affecting current contract manfacturingprovisions. First, the Agency proposed to revise the definition of ``operatedby the same producer'' in andSection; 152.3(q). This definition is the keyto an exemption from registration provided by the statute in FIFRA sec.3(b). The Agency proposed to limit this definition to its clear statutorymeaning, which would exclude from the definition contractual arrangementsbetween different companies. The modified definition would include onlyfacilities owned or leased by a single company.At the same time, the Agency proposed to continue an exemption for certaincontract manufacturing by specifically including contractual agreementsin andSection; 152.30, which exempts certain types of transfers from registration.EPA proposed to exempt from registration certain transfers of pesticidefor the purpose of processing, packaging, or labeling, provided, amongother things, that the transferor was the owner of the transferred pesticideand the registrant of the final product distributed or sold.Thirteen commenters commented upon the two proposed sections. Althoughsome addressed the definitional change and others the exemption, all expressedsimilar concerns. Commenters stated that, when considered together, thedefinitional change and the revised exemption provision would precludethe contract manufacturing operations that are extensively relied uponby producers. Commenters stated that many registrants contract out theirentire production operation, including production, packaging and labeling;they may also contract out certain distribution by means of a supplementalregistration (see andSection; 152.132). The reasons cited for such extensivecontracting operations are varied. For small companies not having a productionfacility, contracting may be the only way to distribute and sell a pesticide;for large companies, temporary contractual arrangements afford flexibilityin producing a product while the registrant determines whether the marketingof a product warrants construction of a dedicated production facility.These practices have been possible in the past, despite the language ofthe statute and regulations, because of an exercise of prosecutorial discretionby EPA. The Agency announced that it would not regard as an actionableviolation of FIFRA the transfer of an unregistered pesticide pursuant toa contract, providing that the transferor would supply the pesticide inquestion to no one in the United States except the transferee contractingparty. However, for reasons described in this unit of the preamble, EPAhas determined that it will not continue this enforcement policy.A common arrangement has been for a contractor who is formulating the productfor the registrant to obtain quantities of an unregistered technical gradeactive ingredient from a producer other than the registrant. The registrantof the formulated product is not the owner of the transferred technicalmaterial, as required by proposed andSection; 152.30, nor is the formulatingprocess carried out in a facility ``operated by the same producer'' withinthe meaning of the proposed definition. Consequently, under the proposedrule, the transfer of that technical chemical to the contract formulatorwould be in violation of the Act unless the technical chemical is a registeredpesticide product.In general, commenters asserted that the proposed changes would have theeffect of eliminating the current contract manufacturing system, and wouldbe burdensome to formulators, who rely on contract manufacturing. Theybelieved EPA should reinstate the definition to provide that contractualrelationships be deemed to be ``operated by the same producer'' and thatandSection; 152.30 should be modified to accommodate industry contractingpractices. In short, they objected to the proposed revision and urged thatthe current provisions be restored. The Agency has considered the comments,but has decided to retain the definition change and the exemption providedby andSection; 152.30 (the language of that section has been modified, however,as explained in this preamble unit).The commenters are correct in their analysis of the effect of the proposedchange; as stated in the preamble to the proposal, ``[t]he practical effectwould be that a product would have to be registered prior to any transferrepresenting a sale or change in ownership.'' It was the Agency's intentionto require that pesticides be registered before they are sold or transferredfrom one person to another, even for further formulation under contract.The final rule will not preclude contract manufacturing, but will limitthe use of unregistered pesticides in contract manufacturing.The Agency has cogent reasons for its decision to require the registrationof all technical products. First, the Agency does not believe that Congressintended the exemption from registration in FIFRA sec. 3(b) to be so broadlydefined. A straightforward reading of FIFRA sec. 3(b) suggests that theexemption it provides should be limited as the Agency is doing.Second, EPA is concerned about the lack of regulation of the large volumeof unregistered pesticides that it believes are being transferred. Theprevious exemption permitted an unquantified volume of unregulated distributionand sale of pesticides. Pesticide production reports submitted under FIFRAsec. 7 include numerous pesticides having a large production of end useproducts with no corresponding reported production of a technical gradeactive ingredient. EPA believes that the policy which allowed producersof technical grade active ingredient to distribute and sell product underthe umbrella of a ``sole transferee'' contract accounts for much of thisdiscrepancy.The sale and distribution of unregistered products is contrary to the Agency'smandate to protect human health and the environment, leaves large gapsin the Agency's knowledge about and control of such pesticides, createscompetitive inequities among similar products in the marketplace, and underminesthe efforts of producers of registered products to comply with FIFRA.FIFRA provides a comprehensive regulatory scheme covering all pesticideproducts. Registration is the principal means of ensuring that a productis brought under the FIFRA regulatory scheme. The registrant must demonstrateto the Agency's satisfaction that the product meets the statutory criteriafor registration with respect to composition, labeling, and lack of unreasonableadverse effects. The registrant must take responsibility for quality controlof the product's composition and for adequate labeling describing the product,its hazards and uses. He must submit or cite data concerning the pesticide'simpact on man and the environment, and must assume obligations requiredby section 3(c)(1)(D) with respect to data compensation. Once registered,a registrant is required under FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2) to report to EPA anyfactual information concerning the unreasonable adverse effects of thepesticide on the environment. A person selling an unregistered producthas not complied, and is under no obligation to comply, with any of theserequirements.The producer of a pesticidal active ingredient is more likely to becomeaware of certain types of sec. 6(a)(2) information than a formulator whobuys the active ingredient. EPA is increasingly concerned about the presenceof potentially toxic impurities in pesticides, and is taking steps to reducethe levels of such impurities. For instance, EPA has recently requiredthe reduction of DDT impurity levels in products containing technical dicofol.EPA can more effectively require and monitor compliance with such a directiveif the active ingredient is registered before being distributed and sold;it would have great difficulty in ascertaining compliance for similar productsthat are not registered by the ingredient's producer. In a situation suchas this, where the Agency has concerns about the composition of a technicalgrade active ingredient, the Agency cannot address its concerns by dealingonly with formulators, who may not be aware of the impurities of the technicalthey purchase. Distribution and sale of unregistered products thus seriouslyimpairs the Agency's ability to promote the development of safer pesticides.By requiring registration of all products, EPA also gains the efficiencyof dealing with fewer companies in matters concerning safety of activeingredients or their impurities. Rather than having to concern itself witha large number of formulators who buy and use unregistered technical pesticides,the Agency can focus on the producers of the technicals, who are both moreknowledgeable about the chemicals and significantly fewer in number. Registrationof these products also will reduce the potential for a registrant to abusethe data compensation scheme under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(D) and 3(c)(2)(D)by stating in its registration application that it will purchase a registeredproduct, and then instead using an unregistered product as the source ofthe active ingredient.Commenters who feared that limitation of the contract manufacturing exemptionfrom registration would increase costs or be burdensome apparently basetheir conclusion on the data compensation implications of requiring registrationof technical products. Ideally, of course, data costs to the registranteither would be included in the purchase of a registered product or wouldarise under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(D) because of the use of an unregisteredproduct. However, until all products are required to be registered or reregistered,the real world situation may be that use of an unregistered product isless costly.If all products must first be registered, the burden of data generationand compensation will tend to shift from formulators to technical producers.In turn, this will foster a more competitive market in which FIFRA regulatoryrequirements are not a significant influence on or determinant of costdifferential.Accordingly, in the final rule, andSection; 152.15 requires the registrationof all pesticides, including products intended for formulating use. Section152.30(a) contains the statutory exemption provided by FIFRA sec. 3(b)for products moving between establishments operated by the same producer.In addition, a specific exemption is needed to address contract manufacturingpractices (using registered products) between facilities operated by differentproducers. The Agency does not intend to interfere with or curtail in anyway such contract manufacturing practices relied upon by registrants. Manyproducts are produced by a series of contract operations, involving varioussteps in informulation, packaging, and labeling. Since intermediate products(varying in composition, packaging, or labeling from the technical or finalproduct that is registered) must be shipped between facilities not operatedby the same producer to accomplish this, a specific exemption from theregistration requirement is needed. Section 152.30(b) therefore containsan exemption allowing transfer of what technically are unregistered pesticidesfor contract manufacture and packaging by establishments operated by differentproducers. As long as the products used are registered, the final productis registered, and the transferred intermediate products are properly labeled,the Agency is confident that adequate environmental and regulatory safeguardsare in place.The Agency has already taken steps to begin the process of regulating moreclosely pesticides used in contract manufacturing. EPA issued a notice(PR Notice 87-7, June 3, 1987) revoking the previously-mentioned enforcementpolicy statement and requiring that applications for currently unregisteredtechnical pesticides be submitted by September 30, 1987. As of the effectivedate of this rule, the transfer of unregistered pesticides (except as providedby andSection; 152.30) will be a violation of FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(A).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Registration Procedures</ITAG>A. Amended Applications Not Requiring Full ReviewThe Agency proposed in andSection; 152.42 to define categories of amendmentsto registration that did not require review or approval prior to implementation.Section 152.42(b)(1) listed amendments to registration that could be accomplishedsimply by notification to the Agency, and implemented immediately afternotice was given. Section 152.42(b)(2) listed amendments that could bemade without notice to the Agency.The Agency proposed that certain relatively routine amendments to registrationbe subject only to a notification requirement, and that others of evenlesser significance be permitted without notification to the Agency. Ofthe 10 commenters on this proposal, 7 supported the concept that not allamendments require the same level of scrutiny by the Agency, and that somecan be discretionary with the registrant.Several commenters proposed that additional types of labeling amendmentswould be suitable for inclusion in the ``no approval'' category in andSection;152.42(b)(1)(ii) or the ``no notification'' category in andSection; 152.42(b)(2).Two commenters suggested that changes in label format consistent with Part156 should require no notification, noting that the language is alreadyapproved by EPA. EPA agrees that the Agency need not review each formatchange that is consistent with Part 156, provided that the language ofthe label does not change. Accordingly, paragraph (b)(2) has been revisedto specify that changes in label format for consistency may be made atthe discretion of the registrant.One of those commenters stated that advertising claims are often placedon labels. Although EPA does not prohibit advertising on pesticide labels,it cautions that advertising must not differ or detract from the approvedlabel, and that it may not obliterate or obscure the required label language.Two other commenters suggested that paragraph (b)(2) be revised to requireonly notification when a company wishes to market an already-registeredproduct as two products, each bearing a subset of approved use. Moreover,the commenters suggested that label claims be permitted to be transferredbetween registrations of the same formulation. Although the commentersappear to view these two situations as identical, EPA does not and wishesto clarify its policy.The first situation is already permitted, in EPA's opinion, and will continueto be acceptable under andSection; 152.130(b). A company having a registeredproduct is permitted (both by current policy and by this final rule) tomarket the product in a variety of ways. The product may be marketed underdifferent brand names, each product bearing the full set of uses approvedby the Agency. Or it may be marketed under the same brand name, but bearingdifferent subsets of approved uses (for example, to distinguish primaryuses for different regions of the country). Or each product may bear botha different brand name and a different subset of approved uses. In eachcase, the product is a single formulation having a single registrationnumber, and no other changes in labeling are permitted (in fact, if ``splitting''the uses would result in changes in precautionary labeling, the ``split''is not permitted).The second situation is somewhat different. It appears that the commentersespouse the transfer of uses (without notification to the Agency) betweentwo separately registered products having the same formulation. This isnot acceptable to the Agency. Agency records are compiled and organizedbased upon individual registrations. A single registration covers a specifiedapproved set of uses, regardless of whether there are other registeredproducts with the same composition but different approved uses. If theAgency were to permit approved uses from one registered product to be transferredto another registered product without approval, accurate recordkeepingand effective enforcement would be virtually impossible.Three commenters noted an inconsistency between the language in andSection;152.46(b)(1)(v) that required notification of a change in the source of``beginning materials'' (defined to include inert ingredients) and thelanguage in andSection; 152.46(b)(2)(i) that permitted change in the sourceof inert ingredients without notification to the Agency. In response, theformer paragraph has been revised to exclude inert ingredients.Two commenters noted that Agency's proposed deletion of the supplementaldistributor regulations as superfluous, and, while agreeing with the Agency,suggested that the requirements be retained for completeness. The Agencyagrees, and in the final rule has included supplemental distributor requirementsin Subpart G (Rights and Obligations of Registrants). This location hasbeen chosen because, strictly speaking, a distributor arrangement is notan amendment to registration, but the exercise of a right accorded to aregistrant to facilitate distribution and marketing of a pesticide product.B. Separate ApplicationsIn the final rule, EPA has revised andSection; 152.45 (now andSection; 152.43)to describe more explicitly what variations in product composition requireregistration of a new product. This has been necessitated by comments receivedon the proposal, as well as the Agency's ongoing project to revise andcall in the statements of formula for all products.In the final rule, the Agency has stated that a composition variation wouldtrigger a requirement for separate registration if:1. The variation would result in the active ingredient's nominal concentrationfalling outside the certified limits for the basic product; or2. The variation would require different dosage rates, use directions orprecautionary statements on the labeling. Whenever the labeling of alternativeformulations would differ because of the change in composition of the product,a separate product must be registered. This is an overriding considerationthat outweighs any other permitted variations, and precludes excessivevariation in the composition of any product.For practical purposes, this means that registrants may substitute inertingredients in a product to the extent that the total percentage of inertingredients does not change. EPA believes that variation of inert ingredientswill rarely result in a change in the formulation type of the product,but in andSection; 152.43 EPA has reserved the right to reject an alternateformulation that is significantly different from those already registeredunder a single registration number. If the alternate formulation wouldresult in a change in product type, the Agency is likely to require separateregistration. The Agency anticipates that a requirement for separate registration(in lieu of an alternate formulation) will rarely be necessary.Substitution, addition, or deletion of an active ingredient would affectthe label ingredients statement and would require a separate registration.Under this policy, the registrant could vary the source of his active ingredient(s);however, changing the source of an active ingredient normally will requirethe submission of information concerning the new source, particularly ifthe new source is an unregistered product.In all cases, a registrant seeking an alternate formulation must amendhis registration by submitting an application for amendment, and an additionalstatement of formula for approval. EPA thus will be able to monitor alternateformulations.C. Content of ApplicationsEight commenters addressed the Agency's proposed requirements for applicationsfor registration. Since few of the requirements were new, the commentswere limited to three particular items that were required for the firsttime:1. The releasable summary of data required by andSection; 152.50(c). Fivecommenters questioned the requirement for a releasable summary of the application.Two commenters remarked that the andSection; 152.119 referenced in the proposaldoes not exist. This section was promulgated as part of the data compensationregulations (Subpart E of Part 152) on August 1, 1984 (49 FR 30903), andhas been incorporated into Subpart F in this final rule. Two commentersstated that the Agency's rationale for this requirement was not clear,and requested additional justification for the requirement; one assertedthat the requirement was significant enough to warrant reproposal. Neithercommenter, however, expressed any specific objection to the requirement.Two other commenters objected to the proposed requirement that an applicationset forth ``reasonable grounds'' for approval, stating that submissionof the application constituted reasonable grounds, and that an additionalstatement was therefore unnecessary.The Agency agrees with this last comment, and has revised andSection; 152.50(c)to delete the language. Section 152.50(c) now requires the submission ofa list of studies submitted, with a brief summary of the results. The listrequired by this section will suffice as the transmittal document requiredby andSection; 158.32. Moreover, because it will be a releasable summary,the Agency will be able to respond rapidly to requests for informationafter registration. A summary of data may obviate the need for more extensiveand time-consuming clearance of an entire study and, EPA believes, maybetter serve the needs of the non-technical public. The Agency believesthat additional justification is not necessary, that additional commentwould not be useful or significant, and that reproposal would be burdensome.Accordingly, the provision, as modified, is adopted in this final rule.2. The Good Laboratory Practices certification. Several commenters notedthat the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) requirements mentioned in andSection;152.50(g)(2) currently apply only to toxicological studies. The commentersare correct, and the provision has been revised to insert the words ``ifapplicable.'' EPA notes that it is considering the adoption of GLP requirementsfor other types of studies (such as ecological effects studies), and thislanguage will be satisfactory even if Part 160 is revised to expand thecoverage of GLPs. 3. The requirement that applicants submit adverse effects data in the samemanner that registrants are required by FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2) to submit suchinformation. The Agency has considered comments in response to both theSeptember 26, 1984, proposal, and the October 3, 1985, proposal concerning``flagging'' of data. The Agency received seven comments on its September 26 proposal. Severalpointed out that FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2) applies only to registered products,and suggested that the section be deleted. Others suggested that the policywould be more appropriately dealt with in the Agency's policy statementon FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2), published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 20, 1985 (50 FR 38115). Two commenterssuggested that the requirement be made consistent with the FIFRA 6(a)(2)policy, which requires the submission only of new information and onlyif not available in published literature sources. In response to the comments suggesting that the requirement be deletedbecause FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2) applies only to registered products, EPA notesthat the authority for this requirement is not section 6(a)(2), but section3(c)(1), which authorizes the Agency to prescribe the data that must besubmitted in support of applications for registration. The Agency has chosento apply the same requirement to applicants that is imposed on registrants.Consequently, the final rule retains the requirement, now located as andSection;152.50(g)(3), addressing registration data requirements. Moreover, thatparagraph now references Part 153, Subpart D, as the basis for identifyingwhich information must be submitted. This will eliminate concerns expressedby commenters about inconsistency. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Registration Procedures </ITAG>In Subpart D of the proposal, the Agency prescribed the procedures it woulduse in processing applications for reregistration in response to issuanceof a registration standard. No comments were received on these procedures;however, one commenter addressed two legal aspects of the registrationstandards process (that precedes the procedures proposed in Subpart D).Although not pertinent to the proposed procedures, the Agency would liketo make clear its position on these points. The commenter, an environmental group, asserted that registration standards,which the Agency develops as position documents supporting its regulatoryactions under FIFRA sec. 3(g) and 6, should be considered regulations,subject to the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative ProcedureAct. The commenter noted that many registration standards are given proceduraltreatment similar to that of regulations, and therefore should be affordedlegal status as regulations. EPA disagrees. Registration standards are support documents underlying the regulatorydecisions taken by the Agency. As a licensing statute, FIFRA requires thatthe Agency take regulatory action on an individual product basis. Althoughthe Agency may issue regulations governing all or a group of pesticideproducts, regulatory decisions generally are made legally binding on individualproducts through cancellation actions. EPA thus far has chose not to usethe rulemaking process in carrying out the reregistration of individualproducts. Second, the commenter asserted that Registration Standards are subjectto the Environment Impact Statement (EIS) requirements of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), since they are ``major Federal actions.''Regulatory actions taken by EPA have been held by the courts not to besubject to the requirements of an EIS under NEPA. Consideration of environmentalconcerns is intrinsic to the decisionmaking process at EPA. FIFRA's substantiveand procedural provisions for the registration of pesticides, includingtheir reregistration, are the functional equivalent of an EIS. Under thefunctional equivalency doctrine, EPA is not required to prepare a specificdocument addressing environmental issues. The process used by the Agencyin developing registration standards itself provides for the analyses whichwould be required in an EIS. Moreover, the courts have found that in establishingthe licensing process under FIFRA, Congress recognized that compliancewith NEPA's procedural requirements would not be appropriate. The Agencytherefore declines to accept the comment. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Agency Response to Application </ITAG>Proposed Subpart F described the procedures and criteria that the Agencywould use in reviewing and approving applications for registration andamended registration. This subpart largely described the Agency's currentprocedures and practices and did not propose a significant departure fromthose procedures. Comments were received primarily from industry sourcesand generally reflected their knowledge of these procedures and criteria.Few commenters expressed serious concerns with the Agency proposal or suggestedthat significant modifications were necessary. The majority of commentssuggested clarifications. A. Procedural Issues One commenter noted that the Agency proposed in andSection; 152.102 to issuefor publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice of receipt of an application for registrationof a new chemical or significant new use pattern, but questioned why nonotice of approval was provided for. In response, EPA has revised the sectionto provide for publication of a notice of final action. The commenter alsosuggested that the notice of receipt should include the Agency's assessmentof the application. EPA does not agree with this comment. The notice ofreceipt is required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(4) to be published promptly afterthe application is received, and cannot await the Agency's evaluation ofthe application. Moreover, the purpose of the notice is to obtain commentfrom the public and other Federal agencies, rather than to provide theAgency's conclusions regarding the application. Two clarifications were requested with respect to the Agency's proposedtreatment of incomplete applications. The Agency stated that it would notbegin or continue review of incomplete applications, defined generallyby andSection; 152.104. A number of commenters argued that minor deficienciesshould not hold up review of applications. With respect to applications for so-called ``me-too'' products, which aresubstantially similar to existing products, The Agency intends to followits current practices. The Product Manager will screen incoming applicationsfor completeness; he may choose to telephone or write applicants to correctminor deficiencies, while continuing the review of the application, orhe may choose to reject the application because it cannot be processedwithout correction. With such applications, the Agency normally will retainthe application awaiting response from the applicant. After 75 days, however,if no response is forthcoming from the applicant, the Agency will treatthe application as if it had been withdrawn. The Agency cannot afford tostore pending applications indefinitely awaiting response by applicants.Administrative withdrawal and a requirement for a new application permitthe Agency to clear its files of applications after a reasonable periodof time for response. On the other hand, when an application is submitted for a new chemicalor the first food use of a pesticide, involving substantial amounts ofdata and the expenditure of greater resources and time for review, theAgency will more rigorously screen the application. The Agency has issueda notice to registrants (PR Notice 86-4, April 15, 1986), describing itsscreening procedures for such applications. These procedures provide forthe rejection of incomplete applications without extensive review, andfor the return of applications to the applicant. The Agency will not beginsubstantive review of such applications until they are complete and correct.In these cases, the 75-day response time will not apply, since the applicationwill be returned to the applicant, who may reapply at his convenience.Several commenters asked for clarification of the 75-day response time.Two suggested that it not start until receipt by the applicant of a certifiedletter; another believed that only ``working days'' should be counted.The Agency cannot adopt the first commenter's suggestion, since Agencyletters are not routinely sent by certified mail. (The Agency, as a ruleof thumb, does allow a 15-day mail lag time.) Because the 75-day timeframeis not calculated by the Agency by means of certified mail receipts, theAgency declines to commit itself to the more rigorously defined ``workingdays'' suggested by the second commenter. To do so would lengthen the responsetime by one-third (75 working days is approximately 105 calendar days).EPA believes that 75 days is sufficient time for a registrant either tocorrect deficiencies or to tell EPA when they will be corrected.Two commenters expressed concern with the Agency's policy of reviewingand approving only draft labeling rather than final printed labeling (andSection;152.108). Both were concerned about the ability of the States, which enforceFIFRA requirements under cooperative agreements, to discern compliancewith the Act. These same concerns were raised and have been thoroughlydiscussed in previous documents, including the proposed and final regulationsestablishing the policy, issued in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 15, 1982 (47 FR 40659) and thatof January 4, 1984 (49 FR 380), respectively. The Agency is not aware ofserious problems that have arisen with the policy in the 3 years it hasbeen in effect.One of the commenters also questioned whether, given the labeling changesthat are permitted by the Agency without notification by andSection; 152.42,the States might not encounter labels in channels of trade that are significantlydifferent from those approved by the Agency. The changes permitted by andSection;152.42 are those that the Agency considers minor, unlikely either to involvecompliance questions by States or to be of serious consequence even ifnot correctly accomplished. Furthermore, the permitted changes are insignificantwhen compared with the changes in format that are permitted to be madebetween the Agency's review of draft labeling and the final printed labelthat actually is found in channels of trade. EPA believes that States haveadapted well to the current Agency practice of approving draft labeling,and that changes permitted by andSection; 152.42 will pose no additionalproblems.In andSection; 152.110, the Agency stated that it would review applicationsfor registration as expeditiously as possible, but the Agency did not proposeto establish binding review times. Six commenters urged the Agency to obligateitself to specific review times for applications. Suggestions ranged from75 to 180 days, with one commenter suggesting that the Agency publish areview timetable for various types of applications.EPA has not adopted these suggestions. FIFRA does not mandate statutorytimeframes for review of applications: the language of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(3)requires that Agency's determination of registrability be made ``as expeditiouslyas possible.'' The Agency agrees with the commenters that, from a policyperspective, the Agency would prefer to be able to set achievable timeframesin which to review applications and determine acceptability. However, thenature of the registration process, and the associated regulatory evaluationsand decisions that accompany it, preclude the Agency from doing so. EPAcannot predict the number of applications for registration that it willreceive each year, because submission of an application is largely at thediscretion of persons seeking registration. Nor can the Agency determinethe level of review that will be needed to evaluate the application; someapplications are of greater complexity than others. The Agency does notbelieve it prudent to establish regulatory timeframes that it may not beable to meet consistently because of circumstances beyond its control.Therefore, the final rule does not establish Agency review times.B. Conditional RegistrationSections 152.113 through 152.115 described the criteria for issuance ofconditional registration under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7) and the conditions attachedto such registrations. One commenter focused on these criteria and procedures,in particular those in andSection;andSection; 152.114 and 152.115 relatingto conditional registration of new chemicals.The commenter objected to the Agency's issuance of conditional registrationfor new chemicals. Acknowledging that the statute permits such registrations,and that amendment to FIFRA itself would be necessary to remove the authorityfor issuance, the commenter urged that the Agency adopt a policy (whichwould be expressed in the final rule), of severely limiting the issuanceof new chemical conditional registrations.First, the commenter expressed the opinion that conditional registrationshould not be granted for any new chemical that meets or exceeds risk criteriafor special review found in 40 CFR Part 154. Second, the commenter urgedthat the final rule provide criteria for the public interest finding thatmust be made before a new chemical conditional registration is granted.FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7) requires that the Agency determine that issuance is``in the public interest'' before granting conditional registration fora new chemical. The commenter stated that without definitive criteria onwhich to base a determination of public interest, the Agency could grantconditional registrations for new chemicals very broadly and, it is feared,without adequate justification. Finally, the commenter urged that conditionalregistration of new chemicals should be limited to the specific periodrequired for generation of required data, and that conditional registrationsshould expire automatically at the end of that time if required data arenot submitted.In response to all of these comments, the Agency notes that it has issueda policy statement in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 5, 1986 (51 FR 7628), describing itspolicies for issuance of conditional registration of new chemicals. Thatpolicy statement addresses each of the commenters' concerns in an affirmativemanner. It states that the Agency will not grant conditional registrationfor new chemicals if the available data demonstrate that special reviewcriteria are exceeded. It further sets out in greater detail the typesof information that may be necessary for the Agency to make a public interestfinding in accordance with FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(C). Lastly, the policy statementprovides that conditional registrations will expire automatically if data(or interim progress reports) are not submitted in a timely manner or ifthe data, when submitted, show that the pesticide would meet or exceedrisk criteria for special review.In response to these comments, andSection; 152.114 listing the criteria forapproval of conditional registration of new chemicals has been revisedto clarify that the public interest determination applies only during theexpected period of the conditional registration. Section 152.115(b), specifyingthe conditions of registration for new chemicals, has been revised moresubstantively. The conditions attached to registration under FIFRA sec.3(c)(7)(C) now include an automatic expiration (in addition to Agency-initiatedcancellation as provided in the proposal) if data or progress reports arenot submitted. Moreover, andSection; 152.115 now also includes the conditionthat the conditional registrant submit information on production of theconditionally registered product. This information is required by the Agencyfor its annual report to Congress under FIFRA sec. 29.C. Denial of ApplicationsProposed andSection; 152.118 contained proposed procedures for denial ofapplications for registration. Three commenters noted the provision inandSection; 152.118(e) that, upon notice of denial (by certified mail, assuggested by two commenters), an applicant would have 30 days to respondand correct the deficiencies. The commenters asserted that 30 days is insufficienttime to respond properly with corrective action, and urged lengtheningthe time to 60 or 90 days. They believed that it is unfair to expect 30-dayresponse from the applicant when the Agency has taken several months toreview the application.Although the Agency is sympathetic to the perceived plight of the commenters,EPA notes that FIFRA sec. 3(c)(6) requires a 30-day response to a noticeof intent to deny. If the applicant fails to respond within the 30 days,that section states that the Administrator may refuse to register the pesticide.This discretionary authority permits EPA to provide additional time forcorrection if warranted. EPA does not expect that all corrections can beaccomplished within the 30 days. EPA is seeking, at a minimum, an indicationfrom the applicant that he intends to make the corrections within a giventime period. Thus, although 30 days would seem to bind the applicant toa short time for both response and correction, EPA may permit longer foractual correction, provided that the applicant notifies the Agency withinthe allotted 30 days.A second commenter noted that paragraph (d) apparently makes discretionarythe Agency's publication of a notice of denial in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. He cited the language stating that the Agency``may issue in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a notice of denial * * *,'' and interpreted thisto mean that publication is discretionary. The language in the final rulehas been revised to clarify that it is the decision to deny that is discretionary.All notices of denial will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, as required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(6).<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Undeliverable Mail</ITAG>The Agency proposed in andSection;152.122 that if applicants do not keepthe Agency apprised of their current name and address of record, the Agencywould suspend the registrations of all products of that applicant. Twocomments were received on this provision, neither objecting, but offeringsuggested clarifications. Since this proposal, the Agency has issued inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 5, 1986 (51 FR 7634) a notice announcingthat it will cancel such registrations, and has begun the process of purgingits records of registrations whose owners cannot be located. In the finalrule, the Agency has modified andSection;152.122 to conform to its new policy.The Agency believes that this modification in the final rule does not warrantreproposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Timeframes for Use of Labeling</ITAG>Section 152.128 of proposed Subpart G established timeframes for the useof existing label stocks after the label has been amended (either on theregistrant's initiative or in response to an action by the Agency). Similarly,andSection;152.135, (concerning voluntary cancellation) proposed a time periodfor disposal of existing stocks of the pesticide. Although disposal oflabel stocks upon amendment, and disposal of pesticide stocks after voluntarycancellation are not strictly comparable, comments addressed the two togetherin some cases. Consequently, this unit responds to comments on both andSection;andSection;152.128and 152.135.The Agency proposed a period of 1 year after amendment for the replacementof product labeling if initiated by the registrant. Eleven comments werereceived on this proposal, all of which took exception to the Agency'sproposal; all claimed that 1 year is insufficient time to dispose of existinglabel stocks. The commenters offered various reasons for their objection:sales of seasonal products often extend into subsequent years; the lifeof returnable or reusable containers (which may be embossed or silk-screenedwith permanent labeling) is up to 5 years; health or safety questions thatwarrant such a short time period are not generally at issue in registrant-initiatedamendments; States are unable to keep pace with label transactions eachyear; and some States (unidentified by the commenter) provide a minimumtime of 2 years for exhausting old label stocks. In short, all commentersstated that the Agency should defer to the needs of industry when no questionsof health and safety are involved. On the other hand, no commenter objectedto (and one supported) the idea that where health or safety concerns wereraised, the Agency would specify a timeframe for replacement of labeling,which might be shorter than 1 year.Based on these comments, the Agency has decided that it will permit 18months instead of 12 months for disposition of existing label stocks whenthe amendments proposed by the registrant do not involve health or safetyconsiderations. EPA believes that persons who are seeking label amendmentcan and should plan in advance for use of their label stocks, so that largenumber of label stocks will not remain after 18 months.One commenter urged the Agency to delete the language referring to ``physicalpossession'' as the determinant of which products must be relabeled. Hesuggested that the Agency instead use the more standard term ``releasedfor shipment.''EPA agrees with the commenter and has deleted the term from the final rule.``Physical possession'' is not the term used in FIFRA to define when enforcementactions may be taken. The Act uses the term ``released for shipment'' (FIFRAsec. 9) to define when inspections may be carried out for purposes of compliance,and the Act defines violations (FIFRA sec. 12) in terms of the ``distributionand sale'' of the product. The Agency's current practice in defining dateswhen revised labeling must appear on products has been to specify two dates:a date beyond which the registrant may not distribute or sell the product(a ``released for shipment'' date) and a second, later, date beyond whichdistributors, dealers and retailers may not distribute or sell the product(a so-called ``channels of trade'' date). The Agency intends to continuethis method of specifying timeframes for compliance.One commenter suggested that the voluntary cancellation procedures in proposedandSection;152.135 (codified as andSection;152.138 in the final rule) be modifiedto include a petition process whereby a registrant could petition for aperiod longer than 1 year in which to dispose of a voluntarily cancelledproduct. Rather than specify a specific date by which pesticide stocksmust be disposed with a concomitant petition process to justify a longerperiod, the Agency has deleted from the final rule any specific date bywhich existing stocks must be disposed of. The Agency prefers the flexibilityof dealing with existing stocks questions individually, and hesitates toimpose a formal petition process unnecessarily. Moreover, the Agency believesthat a timeframe for disposal of pesticide stocks should depend on therisks associated with that pesticide that formed the basis for the cancellation.A product that is voluntarily cancelled in the face of impending suspensionor special review decisions may pose risks such that no disposition ofexisting stocks should be permitted. By contrast, a product that is voluntarilycancelled because a changing market no longer supports continued distributionand sale may pose no risks that justify limiting existing stocks distribution.In this latter case, the registrant probably will have only a small stockof product because he has already phased down his production and distributionvolume.Consequently, andSection;152.138 requires that a registrant requesting cancellationof his product propose a timeframe for disposal of existing stocks of thepesticide, taking into account the amount of material and the historicaltime for moving the product through channels of trade. In the notice ofcancellation, the Agency will specify a timeframe for disposal of existingstocks.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Agency Actions Affecting Registration</ITAG>Subpart H of the proposal described in summary form various Agency actionsthat may affect registration_classification for restricted use, data call-in,reregistration, special review, cancellation and suspension, and requireduse of child-resistant packaging.Two commenters addressed this subpart. One commenter urged that when theAgency changes the requirements for data under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(2)(B) (andSection;152.142), the Agency state the reason for the new data and the status ofdata under the old guidelines. The Agency is not certain what the commenteris referring to when he mentions ``changing'' data requirements.The overwhelming majority of data required of registrants under section3(c)(2)(B) are not new or changed requirements, but simply the applicationof current data requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 158 to existing pesticides.If, however, a data requirement being imposed under section 3(c)(2)(B)is not contained in Part 158, or is required only for certain products,the Agency will state the reason for the data requirement.The Agency's policy with respect to previously submitted data is statedin 40 CFR 158.80. That section states that EPA will evaluate a study todetermine whether it was conducted in conformance with accepted scientificprotocols and study designs and whether the results were reproducible.The Agency will not reject a study that is conducted in accordance withAgency recommendations, or another acceptable protocol, provided that thestudy fulfills the purposes for which the requirement was established,and permits sound scientific judgments.One commenter objected to the provision in andSection; 152.148 that the Agencymay initiate cancellation proceedings if the composition, packaging orlabeling of the product do not comply with the Act. The commenter was particularlyconcerned with labeling, stating that labeling requirements are subjective.The commenter asserted that no provision is made in the rule for negotiation,arbitration or other registrant-initiated actions.Section 152.148 states the provisions of FIFRA sec. 6(b), which permitsthe Agency to initiate cancellation proceedings if a product, its packaging,or its labeling is not in compliance with the Act. Once a notice of intentto cancel is issued, however, the registrant has the right to request anadministrative hearing, in which he may contest the basis for the cancellation,including the reasonableness of any labeling requirement that has not beenspecifically established by regulation, or its applicability to his product.During the pendency of such a hearing, the product remains registered.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Restricted Use Classification</ITAG>Subpart I of the proposed rule reorganized and revised the criteria andprocedures for restricted use classification. The Agency proposed few changesin the procedures for classification, and only minor changes in the criteriafor classification. The provisions of proposed Subpart I largely reflectedthe criteria in andSection; 162.11(c) and the procedures in andSection; 162.30.A total of 13 comments were received on Subpart I, the majority directedto the changes in criteria in andSection; 152.170.A. Scope of ClassificationSection 152.160 of the proposal described the scope of the Agency's authorityto classify products, and the overall framework of the program. The Agencynoted that it may classify products for restricted use either by regulationor on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with other regulatory actions.Several commenters stated that the Act does not provide for an ``unclassified''product, as stated in andSection; 152.160(a), and suggested that it be deleted.The commenters are correct that FIFRA sec. 3(d) provides that a productshall be classified for either restricted use or general use. However,as a policy matter, the Agency does not now, and does not intend to, classifyproducts for general use.As stated in the preamble to the proposal, the thrust of the classificationprocess is the identification of products that should be restricted_notthose which do not need to be restricted. A product for which no concernswarranting restriction have been raised does not need confirmation of thatfact by classifying it for general use. The Agency does not intend to devoteits scarce resources to reviewing a product for the purpose of generalclassification_a determination which would carry with it no obligationsor consequences for the registrant. Therefore, a product which has notbeen classified for restricted use remains unclassified in EPA's opinion.Section 152.160 of the final rule acknowledges this fact.A second commenter to andSection; 152.160 objected to the case-by-case determinationsof classification. The commenter argued that case-by-case determinationsdid not permit sufficient phase-in time, provided no notice or commentopportunity under the Administrative Procedure Act, no consideration ofsmall business impacts under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and no judicialreview.The Act specifically provides for case-by-case classification as part ofits registration process. FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(F) requires an applicant forregistration to propose a classification at the time of application andsection 3(d)(1)(A) states that classification shall occur as part of theregistration. In addition, the Act provides for a discretionary processof classification by regulation, which is subject to all the administrativeand judicial protections provided by the Administrative Procedure Act forother regulations. In both cases (case-by-case or by regulation), the Agency'sdecision is a final determination subject to judicial review. Thus thecommenter is in error in assuming that there are no administrative, procedural,or judicial protections for Agency classification decisions.B. Criteria for ClassificationEPA proposed in andSection; 152.170 criteria under which the Agency wouldclassify products for restricted use. The criteria include determinationsby the Agency that the product exceeds certain hazard criteria, that restrictionwould reduce the risk of adverse effects to a greater extent than it woulddecrease benefits from use of the product, and that labeling would notbe sufficient to mitigate the identified risks.The majority of commenters on this subpart expressed concern with the criteriafor restriction for residential and institutional products contained inandSection; 152.170(b). In general, commenters were in favor of the Agency'snot restricting various types of products_e.g., residential, institutional,industrial, or antimicrobial products_or, alternatively, of consideringrestriction only if the products were highly toxic (Toxicity Category I).Some expressed the opinion that the requirements for child-resistant packaging(40 CFR Part 157), together with labeling, are sufficient to protect usersin residential use situations.EPA has not revised the criteria to eliminate the possibility of restricteduse classification for residential/institutional/industrial products. Thecriteria are identical to those in existing regulations (andSection; 162.11(c))for new ``domestic'' products). EPA has not applied those criteria to dateto restrict such products. Child-resistant packaging has been the mechanismthus far used to reduce the risks of products intended for residentialuse. Nonetheless, the Agency does not believe it should limit its regulatorychoices in the manner proposed by the commenters, such that residential,institutional, industrial, or antimicrobial products could not be classifiedfor restricted use if circumstances warrant.A commenter questioned the practicality of a unique and independent fishand wildlife trigger for restricted use (andSection; 152.170(c)). The commenter'smain concern appeared to be the practicality of the fish and wildlife triggerbased on dietary intake, which he stated was difficult to determine. EPAagrees that there is scientific uncertainty in calculations such as thoseproposed. Nonetheless, EPA has developed considerable experience in estimatingdietary intake of pesticides by wildlife, and believes that the estimationsare reliable indicators of hazard. EPA therefore has retained the fishand wildlife triggers based on dietary intake.The same commenter urged that the Agency retain the human risk triggeras prerequisite to a wildlife trigger (i.e., the Agency should not considerrestricted use for wildlife effects unless a human risk trigger has firstbeen exceeded). EPA believes that a scheme in which restriction for ecologicaland environmental effects is only secondary to potential human effectswould provide inadequate protection of the environment, and limits theAgency's regulatory options. Human, ecological, and environmental riskreduction can be equally well served by restricted use classification,which requires application by or under the supervision of a trained certifiedapplicator.Moreover, restricted use classification is intended to function as an alternativeto cancellation of a pesticide that poses unreasonable adverse effectson man or the environment; such effects are not limited to human exposures.If confronted with a pesticide that poses strictly environmental or ecologicalrisks, the Agency might be compelled to cancel products if restrictionwere not available for consideration. Additionally, the criteria for initiatinga special review of a pesticide, a process that may lead to cancellation,include specific and independent criteria for ecological effects. The Agencyhas initiated special reviews of some pesticides based solely on ecologicaleffects. Consequently, EPA will also retain the fish and wildlife restricteduse criteria independent of human effects criteria.Three commenters asserted that use history and accident data, proposedas criteria for potential restriction in andSection; 152.170(d), are notappropriate as triggers for restricted use. They state that these are notindicative of the inherent hazard of the product, but are the result ofmisuse only, and should be deleted as considerations in restricting a product.EPA disagrees. Use history and accident data are important sources of informationon hazards, particularly in the ecological effects area. Moreover, EPAcan usually distinguish between accidents and misuse incidents, and informationfrom accidents can be considered apart from obvious misuse situations.The Agency believes that the training and certification of applicatorsthat is required for restricted use classification can significantly reducethe potential for adverse effects, whether from normal use or misuse. Thusinformation on misuse is an important consideration in evaluating the needfor restriction.The Agency does not contemplate restricting a product based solely on misuseor accident history, but will consider such information as supporting dataon the pesticide's potential to cause adverse human and ecological effects.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Label Improvement Program</ITAG>The Agency proposed to add as Subpart J regulations implementing its LabelImprovement Program (LIP) initiated in 1980. The proposal described theprocedures the Agency would use in conducting an LIP, the expected responsesof registrants, the timeframes for submission of responses, and the compliancetimes for the label changes. Twelve commenters objected to the inclusionof this program in the Agency's regulations. Their objections were varied,but commonly expressed the notions that the program was not sufficientlywell defined in scope and applicability, that it has not ``matured'' tothe point of regulation as yet, and that it could develop into a quasi-registrationfunction not offering opportunity for input by affected or interested parties.Several commenters urged greater participation in the existing non-regulatoryLIP program by industry.Based on these comments, the Agency has decided not to promulgate regulationsfor the LIP program at this time. EPA believes that the LIP serves a usefulfunction, with goals of consistency, uniformity, and clarification of labeling.However, EPA agrees with commenters that the current LIP program is stillevolving and that regulations for its implementation are premature. TheAgency will continue to use the LIP as it has in the past, allowing considerableflexibility in procedures and requirements as individual situations warrant.The Agency will, as requested by commenters, provide more opportunity forparticipation by registrants and the public before issuing LIP notices.At a future time, the Agency may propose regulations for the LIP program.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. Intrastate Products</ITAG>EPA proposed to update its requirements for intrastate products. SubpartL of the proposed rule required that intrastate producers submit applicationsfor full Federal registration no later than July 31, 1988. Products shippedafter December 31, 1988, would be in violation of the Act unless federallyregistered. In addition, the Agency could require earlier submission ofapplications for consistency with regulatory actions concerning federallyregistered products.One commenter pointed out that no provision was made for continued saleand distribution of products if an application had been submitted by July31, 1988, but was still pending as of December 31, 1988. The Agency agreesthat a pending application should suffice to permit continued sale anddistribution of the product while the Agency considers the application.Accordingly, andSection; 152.230 has been revised to state this. The December31, 1988, date for obtaining Federal registration is therefore irrelevant(as would be any specific date for receiving Federal registration). Instead,legal sale and distribution of the intrastate product will be governedby the application submission date of July 31, 1988.Accordingly, by July 31, 1988, each producer of an intrastate product mustsubmit an application for full Federal registration. If no applicationis filed, sale or distribution of the product will be deemed to be in violationof FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(A) after July 31, 1988. The Agency will deny applicationsfor registration of intrastate products that are not complete or sufficientfor review.<ITAG tagnum="84">XV. Devices</ITAG>Subpart M of the proposed rule set out, by reference to the Act and regulations,the requirements pertaining to devices, which are not required to be registeredbut are subject to other provisions of FIFRA. No comments were receivedon this subpart, and it is adopted without change. However, since devicesare not subject to registration requirements, Subpart M has been movedfrom Part 152 to Part 153, containing policies and interpretive rules concerningregistration.<ITAG tagnum="84">XVI. Determination of Active and Inert Ingredients</ITAG>For organizational purposes, the Agency proposed that the information containedin andSection; 162.60 be relocated in Part 158. Current andSection; 162.60describes the general criteria applied to determine whether an ingredientis active in a pesticide product, and lists a number of substances whichare deemed to be inert when used in antimicrobial products. Since thismaterial appeared to relate primarily to the data requirements that mightbe imposed on such substances (depending on whether they were active orinert), the Agency proposed to include the criteria and listing in Part158, which addresses data requirements.Although no comments were received that specifically addressed this organizationalchange or raised issues requiring consideration by the Agency, it was clearfrom comments received on other topics (product chemistry requirementsin particular) that the listing was being misconstrued. At least two commentersassumed that listing a substance in andSection; 158.1001 as an inert ingredientwas equivalent to a clearance process which relieved them of the responsibilityof submitting any data on those substances. The Agency's decision to locatethe material in Part 158 may have contributed to this misperception.The purpose of the listing is to identify substances that are pesticidallyinert; the listing in proposed andSection; 158.1001 applies to substancesused in antimicrobial products. The criteria of proposed andSection; 158.27clearly were related to pesticidal effects of the substances, not toxicologicalor other characteristics for which data may be required. Although the Agencyhas discretion to limit the types and amounts of information it will requireon ingredients in pesticide products, and may discriminate between pesticidallyactive and inert ingredients, it should not be inferred that designationas an inert ingredient automatically has that consequence. The originalneed for making a determination on the listed substances arose becauseregistrants of antimicrobial products tended to include those substancesas active ingredients on their labels. The only regulatory consequencethat can correctly be inferred is that a listed substance may not be designatedon the label as an active ingredient, but must be included in the totalof inerts.To clarify this misperception, the Agency has revised the information andis locating it separately in Part 153, which contains policies pertainingto registration. Section 153.125 clearly describes the criteria as thosefor determining ``pesticidal'' activity. Section 153.125(b) sets out theAgency's authority to determine whether a substance is pesticidally activeor inert (within the meaning of FIFRA sec. 2(m)). Paragraph (c) of thatsection states that designation as inert affects the labeling of the product.A new paragraph (d) has been added to ensure that registrants are awarethat other requirements (including data requirements) may be imposed, eventhough the substances are listed as inert.<ITAG tagnum="84">XVII. Coloration and Discoloration</ITAG>In accordance with FIFRA sec. 25(c)(6), the Agency proposed to requirethat additional types of products be colored (or discolored). Specifically,the Agency proposed that products intended for seed treatment (with certainexceptions) contain a dye, unless instructions were included on the labelto color the seeds separately at the time of seed treatment.No comments were received on this proposal, which reflects current policyand is in conformity with similar regulations under the Food and Drug Administrationand U.S. Department of Agriculture. Accordingly, this requirement is adoptedas proposed.The Agency also proposed to require that granular products for soil applicationbe brightly colored to contrast with soil components. EPA stated that coloredgranules would deter wildlife (particularly birds) from ingesting the granules,and would make application easier. Eight commenters addressed this proposal,seven objecting to the requirement for various reasons. Commenters arguedthat coloration will not deter birds or wildlife; that the Agency has noscientific evidence to support its proposal; that the dyed granules willbe an ``attractive nuisance'' for children; that the addition of dyes willbe costly and not always technically feasible; and that the requirementis arbitrary, being imposed without regard to potential hazard or applicationpractices that might mitigate the hazard.EPA has considered these comments and concludes that they raise issuesneeding fuller evaluation before requirements are imposed. Accordingly,the Agency has deleted the requirement for coloration of granular productsfrom the final rule.Finally, because the requirements for coloration and discoloration aregeneral policy, and do not pertain distinctly to the registration process,they have been redesignated in the final rule as Subpart H of Part 153.<ITAG tagnum="84">XVIII. Format of Data Submissions</ITAG>A. Format RequirementsEPA proposed to establish, as andSection;andSection; 158.32 and 158.33, formatrequirements for the submission of data in support of applications forregistration, experimental use permits, petitions for tolerance, and otherregulatory activities under FIFRA and the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (FFDCA). Submission of data in the formats required will assist theAgency in indexing, cataloging, and reviewing the data, and will facilitateretrieval of data for review and reference purposes. Additionally, therequirements pertaining to segregation of confidential business information(CBI) will permit the Agency to respond more readily to requests underthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) without jeopardizing the confidentialityof information protected by FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1), and without undue delay.In proposed andSection; 158.32, EPA described a number of general formatrequirements for submission of data. Studies must be submitted separately;must contain a title page with specific identifying information; and, whensubmitted with a number of studies, must be transmitted with a cover documentdescribing the entire transmittal. Two commenters addressed the requirementsof this section, requesting clarification of the language on several points.Both commented that at this time the Good Laboratory Practices requirementsreferenced in andSection; 158.32(b)(2) pertain only to toxicological studies.The commenters are correct. Section 160.3(m) of this chapter defines a``study'' in a manner that limits its applicability to toxicology studies.However, EPA has not revised the rule to specify this policy, since thisfinal rule is intended only to cross-reference the requirements of Part160. If Part 160 is revised to add to or change the GLP requirements, aspecific cross-reference in andSection; 158.32 would also have to be revised.The Agency is, in fact, considering revising Part 160 to specify the typesof good laboratory practices that would be appropriate for other typesof studies.Both commenters also requested that the Agency clarify whether the dateof ``completion'' of a study is synonymous with the date of ``issuance''of the study. The Agency wants to know when the study itself was completedby the performing laboratory, not the date it was sent to the submitter.Section 158.32(c) has been revised to clarify this point.B. Confidential Business InformationSection 158.33 of the proposal described the procedures that data submittersmust use in asserting a claim of CBI. First, the Agency proposed that allinformation claimed to be CBI within the meaning of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) be isolated in a separate attachment to the study andcross-referenced in the study itself. Second, the Agency proposed thatother information for which a claim of confidentiality is asserted underFIFRA sec. 10(b) be clearly marked in the text of the study, but not physicallyseparated.Four commenters took exception to the Agency's establishing a system thatrequired segregation of some information from the context of the study.They asserted that the system was cumbersome and complicated for data submittersand that it is heavily weighted toward the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)needs of the Agency. Moreover, they believed that Agency reviewers wouldfind a system that located FIFRA sec. 10(d) information in a separate studyattachment inefficient and difficult to use. All preferred the simplermarking system required for CBI claimed under section 10(b). EPA acknowledges that the procedures required by andSection;158.33 may atfirst be inconvenient and may initially involve slightly increased costsfor data submitters who have not in the past submitted information in thismanner. However, as they gain experience in compiling studies in the requiredformat, data submitters' costs should diminish. Moreover, the costs tothe Government will significantly decrease if these procedures are putin place. The Agency has had experience with the simple marking system advocatedby commenters; the difficulties encountered with this system provided theimpetus for the changes proposed. As to arguments that segregation of claimedCBI will be inefficient for Agency reviewers, EPA disagrees. Agency reviewersrecognize the need to protect CBI, and in drafting Agency documents arerequired to adhere to the same requirements. They are accustomed to theprocedures and have not found the segregation of claimed CBI to be overlyburdensome. The Agency's reasons for requiring separation of claimed CBI under section10(d)(1) were clearly stated in the preamble to the proposal. Commentsfrom data submitters have not convinced the Agency that segregation ofclaimed CBI is unnecessary, nor that a marking system could accomplishthe objectives equally well. EPA continues to believe that the benefitsand efficiencies of the requirements to EPA more than offset the cost andinconveniences cited by commenters in objecting to the requirements. Two commenters questioned the need for the Statement of Non-Confidentialityrequired by andSection;158.33(c). They pointed out that the Agency has statedin andSection;158.33(b) its policy that failure to segregate CBI properlyis deemed to be a waiver of claims by the submitter. Since waiver of claimsis assumed in the absence of an affirmative declaration by the data submitter,the Statement of Non-Confidentiality is redundant. EPA views the policy and the Statement of Non-Confidentiality as complementaryrather than redundant. Although Agency policy is that unmarked and unsegregatedinformation is freely releasable under the FOIA, the Agency believes thatmaximum protection to data submitters (and incidentally to the Agency)is afforded by the affirmative statement required by andSection;158.33(c).If a study is clearly marked as non-CBI, the Agency is assured that thedata submitter has given careful thought to its status, and has not inadvertentlyoverlooked the requirements. Finally, two commenters asked that the final rule clarify where the Statementof Confidentiality Claims should be located, suggesting that the titlepage of the study is an appropriate location. The proposal did not specifya location for the required statement, nor does the final rule. The titlepage of a study may be prepared by the performing laboratory, while thedeterminations of confidentiality would ordinarily be done by the submitterof the data. The Agency prefers that the statement be included on a separatepage immediately following the title page. However, there in no objectionto its being located on the title page if desired by the submitter. <ITAG tagnum="84">XIX. Flagging Criteria </ITAG>EPA issued a proposal in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 3, 1985 (50 FR 40408), that wouldrequire pesticide applicants and registrants to mark or ``flag'' certainstudies at the time of submission to the Agency. The Agency cited the increasedvolume of data expected to be submitted in the near future and its limitedresources for review of those data as reasons for its proposal. Flaggingthe studies would serve to alert the Agency to pesticides having potentiallyserious adverse effects. Earlier, the Agency had issued in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 20, 1985 (50 FR 38115), an interpretiverule concerning the submission of adverse effects data under FIFRA sec.6(a)(2). That regulation, although not requiring the flagging of studies,had requested that submitters voluntarily do so. Together, these two documentsattempted to address all data submissions made by registrants or applicants.In its October proposal, the Agency proposed a set of study types subjectto the flagging requirement. The proposal covered studies of three generaltypes: toxicological studies (subchronic and chronic); ecological effects;and environmental fate studies. For each study, the proposal containedone or more criteria which, if met, would trigger a requirement for affirmativeflagging of the study. The toxicology criteria were qualitative and descriptivein nature. The environmental fate and ecological effects criteria werequantitative and objective. A study was to be flagged by signing a certificationstatement that the study either did or did not meet the criteria. In response to its proposal, the Agency received comments from nine pesticidecompanies or trade associations and one environmental organization. Inresponse to these comments, the Agency is at this time promulgating onlythe toxicology criteria and has better defined those criteria for positiveflagging. The Agency is reassessing the criteria for ecological effectsand environmental fate to determine their feasibility and usefulness andmay in the future promulgate the proposed criteria, or propose differentones. Comments on the proposal are addressed in the following preamblesubunits.A. Need for Flagging The Agency stated in its proposal that it would be receiving large volumesof data in response to its Data Call-In (DCI) and Registration Standardsprograms, and that its limited scientific resources would not permit allsuch data to be reviewed upon receipt. For that reason, EPA viewed flaggingas a means of setting review priorities so that pesticides demonstratingpotentially serious adverse effects could be given early review. Most commenters questioned whether the Agency would accomplish its statedpurpose by its proposal, and several commenters objected to the proposal.Commenters generally stated that the proposal would result in overflaggingof data. Flagging, it was asserted, would not isolate pesticides havingpotential adverse effects; rather, the Agency would be inundated with studiesthat were flagged, which would defeat the purpose of flagging. Commentersattributed this to the combination of several factors: the vagueness, ambiguity,or subjective nature of the criteria, particularly in the area of oncogenicityand chronic feeding studies; the Agency's recommendation for inclusionflagging where scientific uncertainty exists; and the concern that EPAwould seek penalties of an unstated nature, although the proposal did notdescribe such a plan. These three factors, commenters stated, would leaddata submitters to be extremely conservative, with the result that moststudies would be flagged. One commenter also stated that a company desiringearly review of its studies might be inclined to flag them simply for thatpurpose (and could do so with impunity, since the criteria and penaltieswere not sufficiently clear that they could be held accountable for erroneousflagging). The Agency believes this latter occurrence will be infrequent.In response to concerns about ambiguity and lack of clarity in the toxicologicalstudies and the specific comments received, the Agency has revised thecriteria (see Unit XVIII.C.) to delineate more carefully the factors thatshould be applied. With respect to the penalties for failure to flag, under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(2)(B)the Agency may suspend the registration if the data submitter fails toflag the data properly. Moreover, failure to flag may be deemed to be afalsification of a required report under FIFRA sec 12(a)(2)(M). B. Scope of the Flagging Requirement Other commenters who objected to the proposal questioned its utility inthe application review process (as opposed to the Data Call-In process,about which similar comments were not made). Their comments were directedprimarily at new chemicals. Commenters stated that flagging data submittedwith a new chemical application was unnecessary, i.e., that early reviewof the studies would achieve no environmental protection because the chemicalwas not being marketed. These commenters also argued that early reviewwould have little effect upon review resources, since the entire applicationwould still have to be reviewed (including all unflagged studies) beforethe registration could be granted. On the other hand, they pointed outthat flagging of one study could stigmatize the chemical for a single effectwhich might not be significant when considered with the data as a whole.Finally, commenters pointed out that the Agency's stated policy is to givepriority review to safer new chemicals, and that giving early review tostudies demonstrating potential adverse effects runs counter to this policy.A new chemical application having no flagged studies could, presumably,be relegated to a lower review priority while the Agency focused its attentionon a new chemical with a flagged study. Commenters viewed this as an unintendedeffect of the flagging requirement and recommended that new chemical applicationsshould not be subject to flagging. The Agency has decided to retain the flagging requirement for applicationsfor registration. EPA believes that flagging of data for new chemical applications,although not a means of prioritizing the review of the application, willbe useful in other ways. For example, if the Agency has under review otherregulatory actions on a chemical, such as a section 18 exemption request,EPA will be able to use flagged data in evaluating the request. In the case of an application for registration of a me-too product or fora new use of an old chemical, flagging will serve the purpose of identifyingthe study for early review. An application for a new use of an old chemicalor for a me-too product is generally reviewed in an order determined byfactors other than the type of amount of data submitted. In the case ofme-too products, data that would require flagging are rarely submitted.Similarly, unless an applicant seeks a significantly expanded use requiringsubmission of a full battery of studies, the Agency does not expect theroutine submission of the types of studies requiring flagging. In bothof these cases, EPA views the flagging of data that are submitted as especiallyimportant, since the Agency normally will not alter its current reviewpriorities for such applications unless prompted to do so by having thestudies flagged. Finally, EPA notes that the task of flagging the data is not overly time-consumingor difficult, and that the number of studies requiring flagging is relativelysmall. EPA believes that the burden upon registrants will be insignificantcompared to the time and expense of producing the study in the first place.C. Toxicology Criteria The Agency proposed flagging criteria for six types of toxicological studiescommonly required by the Agency. These included oncogenicity, chronic andsubchronic feeding studies, reproduction, teratology, and neurotoxicitystudies. 1. <T3>Oncogenicity studies</T3> (Criteria 1 through 4 in the final rule).A number of commenters raised similar concerns about unclear terms usedin describing the criteria, particularly for oncogenicity and chronic feedingstudies. They singled out terms such as ``marginal,'' ``substantial,''and ``decreased time,'' as needing better definition. They noted that unlessthe terms are better defined, industry compliance and enforcement wouldbe difficult, and excessive flagging would result. Commenters suggestedadditional language that they believed would help clarify the criteria,including ``statistically and biologically'' significant increases, ``concurrentand historical'' controls, and ``treatment-related'' effects. In response to these comments, the Agency has substantially revised thecriteria for oncogenicity studies to eliminate many of the imprecise terms.Specifically, EPA has eliminated the terms ``marginal'' and ``substantialincrease.'' and has included language concerning ``concurrent controls''and ``statistically significant'' increases in tumor development. EPA, however, has not adopted language concerning ``historical'' controls,or ``treatment-related'' or ``biologically significant'' tumor development.The Agency recognizes the importance of the concepts such as ``historicalcontrols,'' ``biological significance,'' and ``treatment-related effects''in the ultimate determination concerning oncogenicity of a pesticide. However,the Agency believes that, since the purpose of the criteria is to providea rough screen to alert the Agency of potential problems, such detailedanalyses are not warranted at this level of review. The ``decreased timeto tumor development'' language has been retained because it is a commonlyrecognized criterion for judging oncogenicity. Although these revisions significantly reduce the ambiguity of the criteria,scientific judgment still must be applied to determine whether the toxicologycriteria have been met, but EPA believes that this scientific interpretationis no more uncertain or ambiguous than that which normally arises in interpretingthe results of any scientific study. 2. <T3>Teratology studies </T3>(Criterion 5). Of the six commenters on theteratology criterion, three suggested the inclusion of the same languageas for the oncogenicity studies. EPA has not included language on biologicallysignificant increases, historical controls, and treatment-related effectsfor the reasons explained before. EPA has included language concerninga ``dose-related response.'' The Agency is conforming this rule to itsposition on teratology as expressed in previous Agency documents (FinalGuidelines for the Health Assessment of Suspect Development Toxicants,September 26, 1986 (51 FR 34028); Standard Evaluation Procedure: TeratologyStudies, OPP, June 1985). The concept of adverse developmental toxicityin the absence or presence of significant maternal toxicity at the samedose level will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Another commenter noted that teratogencity cannot be compared on a fetusbasis, only on a litter basis. The Agency agrees, and has deleted the fetus-basedcomparisons. A third commenter noted that the presence of teratogenicityis sufficient evidence of adverse effects; language requiring an ``increase''in fetal malformations is not appropriate. EPA disagrees, and has retainedthe original language. In most teratology studies, the controls show acertain low background rate of teratogenic effects; therefore an ``increase''when compared with controls is appropriate. 3. <T3>Neurotoxicity studies </T3>(Criterion 6). Commenters on the neurotoxicitycriterion generally stated that the end point of concern_a ``positive effect''_istoo vague and undefined to be meaningful in evaluating whether a studymeets the criterion. Two suggested alternative language that they believedexpressed the criterion more accurately. EPA rejected language requiring``histologic evidence of adverse effect on nerves'' as being too narrow.In the final rule, the Agency has accepted the suggested language of theother commenter, who proposed to base the criterion on a response ``indicativeof acute delayed neurotoxicity,'' but not requiring that a positive responsebe dependent upon histologic findings of nerve effects. The Agency has not adopted language suggested by commenters concerning``historical'' controls, for the reasons cited earlier. Nor has EPA basedthe criterion on ``positive and negative controls'' as suggested by anothercommenter. EPA's concern in evaluating neurotoxic effects focuses on whethersuch effects are greater than negative controls, not on whether they areas potent as positive controls. 4. <T3>Chronic feeding studies </T3>(Criteria 7 and 8). Commenters on thesecriteria focused on the Agency's use of the acceptable daily intake (ADI)which is often derived from the results of chronic feeding studies. Commentersgenerally requested that the Agency clarify what ADI was to be used, whethera provisional ADI (PADI) should be used, and the applicability of the criteriawhen there is no ADI. There was no disagreement with the 10X or 100X factorsused in the translation of the NOEL to the ADI. In applying the chronic feeding criterion, data submitters should use thelatest ADI upon which a tolerance (either temporary or permanent) has beenbased. This may be a PADI if not based on a full complement of toxicologicalstudies sufficient to define an ADI. If no ADI has ever been determined(no tolerances have previously been established), the data submitter shouldflag the first study which permits the establishment of a PADI or ADI,and thereafter apply the criterion as written. 5. <T3>Reproduction studies </T3>(Criterion 9). Two comments were receivedon this criterion. One suggested the inclusion of historical controls,which the Agency has not adopted. The other suggested that the use of the``no observed effect level'' (NOEL) should be replaced with the ``no observedadverse effect level'' (NOAEL). The Agency views these terms as interchangeable,but in the pesticide regulation program has consistently used the term``NOEL'' rather than ``NOAEL'' in previous documents. Language concerning``adverse'' effects would introduce greater ambiguity into the criterion.Therefore, the Agency has not changed the reproduction criterion. 6. <T3>Subchronic feeding studies </T3>(Criteria 11 and 12). Commenters onthe subchronic criteria generally were concerned about the Agency's 200Xand 2000X factors used in translating the NOEL to the ADI. They arguedthat the Agency should not double the factors used (in addition to thetenfold difference factor normally applied based on the use of subchronicinstead of chronic studies). They urged the Agency to use a 100X factorfor the cholinesterase inhibition criterion and a 1000X factor for thegeneral (systemic) toxicity criterion. EPA agrees with these comments,and has revised the criteria for subchronic studies to reflect only a tenfolduncertainty factor. Commenters also suggested language concerning ``treatment-related'' effectsand the NOEL; the Agency has not adopted these suggestions for reasonsgiven earlier. D. Environmental Fate and Ecological Effects Criteria Commenters on both the environmental fate and ecological effects criteriaquestioned whether the criteria would be effective in identifying pesticideshaving potential adverse effects. A typical comment was that in both theenvironmental fate and ecological effects areas, the flagging criteriacould not be applied independently as indicators of potential adverse effects,but must be considered with other studies. Particularly, commenters notedthat the environmental fate criteria are actually characteristics of thepesticide that are meaningless when considered independently. The Agency agrees with commenters that flagging of environmental fate andecological effects studies under the criteria as proposed would resultin a large number of studies being flagged for early review. The Agencyhas tested the flagging criteria by applying them to a random samplingof 23 Registration Standards. Of the available studies (for a number ofStandards, there were no studies which could be judged against the flaggingcriteria), over 80 percent of the hydrolysis and aerobic soil metabolismstudies and 68 percent of the solubility studies would have been flagged.When considered together, it is clear that a large proportion, if not all,pesticides would meet one or more of the environmental fate criteria. Similarly,in the area of ecological effects, 35 to 54 percent of the studies wouldbe flagged, depending upon study type. By contrast, a similar comparison of toxicology studies in the RegistrationStandards surveyed revealed that 30 percent or less of the studies wouldbe flagged (in the Agency's estimation), ranging from a low of 10 percentfor teratology studies to 31 percent of chronic feeding studies. Basedon this limited survey, and the comments received, EPA has decided notto establish flagging criteria for environmental fate studies or ecologicaleffect studies at this time. EPA will be evaluating whether criteria canbe developed that will identify or isolate effects of concern more clearly.At a future time, EPA may promulgate or propose flagging criteria for environmentalfate and ecological effects studies. E. Procedural and Miscellaneous In addition to comments on the criteria, the Agency received a number ofcomments on the procedural aspects of the proposal, as well as some miscellaneouscomments. 1. Does flagging apply to interim reports as well as final studies? No,the requirement applies to the study when complete. However, if the studyis being conducted on a registered pesticide, under FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2)there may be an obligation to submit interim reports identified as 6(a)(2)data. 2. The Agency should issue in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> semi-annually a list of all flagged studies.EPA does not intend to do so. The purpose of flagging is to identify studiesthat should be given early review. Industry commenters were particularlyconcerned that the effect of flagging might be to stigmatize the chemicalin the public perception based on less than complete information. EPA believesit would be premature and inappropriate for the Agency to publicize thesubmission of studies merely because they had been flagged. Until the Agencyhas reviewed studies to determine their significance, publication wouldserve only to raise public concerns and fears that might prove entirelyunfounded. If, based on its review of the study, the Agency determinesto take regulatory action, such as initiating a special review of the pesticide,the agency would then make public its findings and reasons for so doing.3. EPA should use the criteria as indicators that a risk trigger for specialreview has been exceeded. EPA rejects this idea for the same reasons asstated above. The criteria for special review are clearly set out in 40CFR 154.7, and entail consideration of exposure factors not encompassedin the flagging criteria. A pesticide will be placed in special reviewonly upon Agency determination that a special review criterion has beenmet. In this regard, one commenter also suggested that EPA should include flaggingcriteria for exposure factors. The commenter's point was that the Agencyshould give higher priority to a pesticide having high exposure potential,even if there are flagged studies on a low exposure chemical. EPA intendsthat the flagging criteria be used for a relatively rapid screening processfor internal review purposes. If the criteria were encumbered with exposurefactors, which would be considerably more subjective in nature, they wouldlose their usefulness to the Agency, and would be significantly more difficultfor data submitters to interpret correctly. The effectiveness of the flaggingcriteria depends on mutual understanding between the Agency and data submittersof the types of scientific findings that are of concern to the Agency asindicative of potential adverse effects. EPA's objective has been to introducegreater objectivity and clarity into the flagging criteria, not greateruncertainties. As noted earlier, commenters indicated that the criteriaas written (without exposure considerations) were too vague and ambiguous.However, the Agency may take exposure factors into account when determiningthe priority of review among similarly flagged studies. For example, itis likely that higher priority would be given to a flagged study for achemical having high or widespread exposure than to one having limitedexposure. Moreover, another commenter questioned whether the flagging criteria wouldnot put the data submitter in the position of having to make a judgmentcall that the Agency is mandated to make. This commenter raised the questionwhether EPA's independent assessment of the study might be compromisedby the submitter's flagging of the study. Although EPA does not believethat this would happen, inclusion of exposure criteria would certainlygive more credence to the commenter's concern about registrant versus Agencyjudgments. 4. Finally, several commenters remarked on the Agency's recently issuedinterpretive rule on FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2) data. This final interpretive ruleincluded the flagging criteria, with a request that data submitters usethe criteria in submitting section 6(a)(2) data. Although not directlypertinent to this rule, which specifically excludes 6(a)(2) data from theflagging requirement, the comments indicated some confusion as to the roleof the flagging criteria in identifying potential adverse effects dataunder FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2). The Agency has not yet made effective its final 6(a)(2) interpretive rule,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 20, 1985 (50 FR 38115). Before itdoes so, EPA intends to revise the rule in response to concerns raisedby commenters and to republish the final rule. The recommended use of flaggingcriteria will be deleted from the final rule. The Agency agrees with commentersthat flagging of 6(a)(2) data would be a redundant requirement, since 6(a)(2)adverse effects data are inherently relevent to the Agency's risk/benefitdecisionmaking. The purpose of the 6(a)(2) interpretive rule is to delineatethe subset of adverse effects data the Agency is most interested in reviewing.Data identified as 6(a)(2) data are already given priority review in thesame manner as is intended by flagging. Therefore, flagging of only someof those data would create a ``subset within a subset'' situation, whichcould prove confusing to registrants, with no corresponding benefit tothe Agency in early review priorities. <ITAG tagnum="84">XX. Product Chemistry Data Requirements </ITAG>The Agency proposed establishing a new Subpart R of Part 152, which wouldcontain product chemistry data requirements. The proposed data requirementsrepeated the existing product chemistry data requirements currently containedin Part 158. In addition, Subpart R was to codify certain types of productchemistry information contained in the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines,which are referenced in Part 158 in the table of product chemistry requirements(andSection; 158.190), but without guidance on the types and quantity ofinformation required to be submitted. This latter information consistsof information concerning identity and composition of ingredients and impurities,descriptions of starting materials and manufacturing processes, discussionsof potential impurity formation, and requirements for certified limit informationand analytical methods. Eight commenters addressed the product chemistry requirements proposedas Subpart R. All but one of these were pesticide producers or groups whoexpressed concern about the stringency of the requirements. The other commenterwas an environmental group which strongly supported the clarified requirements.A. Reogranization of Part 158 From an organizational standpoint, most commenters noted the redundancyof repeating the product chemistry requirements in two different codifiedlocations (Part 152 and Part 158). The Agency's proposal of Subpart R wasprimarily one of convenience. In order to present the existing productchemistry requirements and integrate the new requirements into a comprehensivewhole, EPA extracted the requirements from Part 158 (which was then readyfor promulgation) and proposed Subpart R. Ultimately, EPA intended to consolidateall the requirements in a single location in Title 40. The Agency agrees with commenters that the requirements should be locatedin Part 158, and has reorganized Part 158 to do so. Product chemistry requirementsare contained in Subpart C, and the remaining data requirements (presentedin tables) comprise Subpart D. Other organizational changes have been madeto accommodate these revisions, but the only substantive changes involvethe revision of the product chemistry requirements. Because of the reorganization of the material, this preamble unit discussessection-by-section the requirements beging adopted by the Agency, and respondsto comments on the proposal. The new organization is used in this preamble.The following table correlates the new Part 158 sections, the old Part158 sections, and the proposed sections. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table_Derivation and Distribution of Part 158 Product Chemistry DataRequirements</T4><H1>New section</H1><H1>Old 158 section</H1><H1>Proposed 152 section</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">158.108 <D>158.115 </D><D>None. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.150 <D>158.105 </D><D>152.340. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.153 <D>158.108(c) </D><D>152.342. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.155 <D>158.108(b) </D><D>152.344. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.160 <D>None </D><D>152.346. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.162 <D>None </D><D>152.348. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.165 <D>None </D><D>152.348. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.167 <D>None </D><D>152.350. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.170 <D>158.120 </D><D>152.352, 152.354. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.175 <D>158.110 </D><D>152.352, 152.353. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.180 <D>158.112 </D><D>152.354. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.190 <D>158.120 </D><D>None. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.202 <D>158.105 </D><D>None. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">158.240-158.740 <D>158.125-158.170 </D><D>None.</D></ITAG></ITAG> B. Scope and Applicability Section 158.150 has largely been repeated from current Part 158. This sectionoutlines the applicability of the product chemistry requirements, and discussestheir purpose and use in the Agency's review scheme and regulatory decisions.A new paragraph has been added discussing the nominal concentration. C. Definitions Section 158.153 contains definitions pertinent to the product chemistryevaluation. The Agency received specific comments on two definitions, andhas revised others for clarity and simplicity. The current (and proposed) definition of ``technical grade of active ingredient''(TGAI) defines the TGAI to include added substances necessary for synthesisor purification. Thus the intended components of the TGAI are the pesticidechemical itself, any starting materials remaining from the reaction process,or added during that process, and any substances remaining from the finalpurification steps. Two commenters suggested that the definition of ``technical grade of activeingredient'' be revised to permit the inclusion of a preservative in theTGAI. The Agency has not adopted this suggestion. The TGAI is the testsubstance normally required for a number of Part 158 studies in toxicology,ecological effects, and environmental fate, and the Agency believes itsintegrity should be preserved as carefully as possible for test purposes.From a strictly scientific standpoint, testing to determine the characteristicsof an active ingredient should be conducted with a version of the ingredientthat is as pure as possible, such as the pure active ingredient. Contaminantsor impurities in the test substance are scientifically undesirable forsuch testing, since they complicate the test procedure and may introduceuncertainties into the evaluation of results. It would be impractical andcostly, however, to require that applicants take extraordinary steps beyondnormal quality assurance measures to purify the TGAI simply for the purposeof most testing. The product of such purification would not be representativeof the actual TGAI that will be incorporated into other products. Therefore,the Agency ordinarily allows use of the TGAI itself, at the point at whichit emerges from the reaction and purification processes, as the most practicalsubstitute, recognizing its limitations. Since unavoidable substances are undesirable in the TGAI, the intentionaladdition of substances (such as a preservative used for stabilization duringshipment to formulators), is less tolerable. Therefore, the final definitionof TGAI has not been modified. Another commenter requested clarification of the definition of ``impurityassociated with an active ingredient.'' This comment, however, was directedto the question of who was required to submit information on the impuritiesassociated with the active ingredient. The commenter's concern was thatformulators should not be required to submit such information, since itwould be available from producers of the TGAI. The final rule specifiesthat formulators would not be required to provide information on the impuritiesin the TGAI, but it does not affect the definition. Consequently, the definitionhas not been revised. With respect to who must submit information on the impurities associatedwith an active ingredient, the burden falls primarily on producers usingintegrated systems, that is, persons who produce the TGAI or end use productin a continuous process. A formulator who purchases a registered productis not expected to provide information on impurities in that product. BothandSection;andSection; 158.155 (product composition) and 158.167 (discussionof formation of impurities) clearly state that the producer of a productby a non-integrated system is not required to provide information on theidentity or amount of impurities contained in the TGAI. The Agency has revised several definitions in other ways, in response tocomments that they were unclear. Further, the Agency has also revised somedefinitions because of modifications in the data requirements (see latersections of this preamble unit). The following changes have been made inandSection; 158.153: 1. Definitions for ``end use product'' and ``manufacturing use product''has been included. These were inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule.2. A definition of ``formulation'' has been added for the purpose of distinguishingthe operation of blending and dilution from that of chemical reaction ordinarilyinvolved in an integrated system. Commenters uniformly noted that datarequirements pertaining to the chemical reaction process were not applicableto the formulation process. 3. The definition of ``beginning material'' has been clarified. First,the term has been changed to ``starting material.'' Second, the definitionhas been modified to clarify that the term applies only to materials usedin a reaction process resulting in a TGAI or its equivalent. Only a producerwho uses an integrated system is required to provide information on startingmaterials.4. The definitions of ``active ingredient,'' ``inert ingredient,'' and``impurity'' have been modified to include groups of structurally similarsubstances as well as single substances. This permits the Agency to specifythat certain closely related impurities, such as nitrosamines, be consideredtogether for testing or regulatory purposes.5. The term ``inert ingredient'' has been changed to delete the words ``intentionallyadded.'' The term is now defined to include only substances intentionallyadded to the pesticide product. Any other constituent that is neither anactive ingredient nor an intentionally added ingredient, such as a degradationproduct, reaction byproduct, or contaminant, is considered to be an ``impurity''within the definition of andSection;158.153(c) for the purposes of productchemistry evaluation. The Agency is aware that, under FIFRA sec. 2(m), impurities are encompassedwithin the definition of inert ingredient. In the final rule, EPA is modifyingthe definition of inert ingredient to exclude impurities. EPA believesthat, for clarity and usefulness of the data requirements contained inSubpart C, the term ``inert ingredient'' should be defined to include onlythose inert ingredients that are intentionally added, and the term ``impurity''should be defined to include all other substances that are not ``ingredients''of the product. This does not modify the legal standing of impurities underthe Act as inert ingredients. However, it significantly improves the abilityof the Agency to describe its data requirements for inert ingredients andimpurities, and makes the terms consistent with their historical connotationand actual usage.6. The term ``integrated formulation system'' is now referred to simplyas an ``integrated system.'' The reason for this is that the term ``formulation''has been defined in andSection;158.153(b) to include only blending and dilutionoperations. An integrated system may or may not include a formulation step.D. Product Composition InformationThe Agency had proposed a set of product composition information that essentiallyrepeated that contained in Part 158. A number of commenters noted thatmuch of the information on active ingredients could be supplied simplyby citing the registration number of the source product (on the assumptionthat the source product is EPA-registered and that EPA will already possessthe information). Another commenter noted that certain identifying informationrequired on inert ingredients is not available to a formulator becauseit is proprietary or trade secret. In general, the comments suggested aneed for clarification of the requirements.EPA agrees with these comments. In order to clarify the product compositioninformation requirements, andSection;158.155 has been reorganized to specifyseparately the information required on active ingredients, inert ingredients,toxic impurities, other impurities associated with the active ingredient,and ingredients that cannot be characterized as discrete substances. Requirementsconcerning impurities associated with inert ingredients have been reservedin this final rule.Section andSection;158.155(a) distinguishes between an active ingredientwhich is derived from an EPA-registered source and one derived from anunregistered source. A formulator who uses a registered product as thesource of an active ingredient in his product is required to provide simplythe pertinent information on the source product, and to provide the nominalconcentration and certified limits of the active ingredient in his product.If the source of active ingredient is not EPA-registered, complete chemicalidentification of the active ingredient is required, including chemicalnames, formulae, and molecular weight. For all active ingredients, thenominal concentration and upper and lower certified limits are required.With respect to inert ingredients, andSection;158.155(b) specifies that thechemical identity of inert ingredients is to be provided by the applicantonly to the extent that it is known to him. A formulator who uses a basicchemical in the formulation of his product, or who simply dilutes the manufacturinguse product with a solvent or water, is expected to provide complete informationon identity. If he uses a proprietary mixture of inert ingredient, suchas a combination of emulsifiers of unknown composition, he is responsiblefor ensuring that the producer of that proprietary ingredient furnishesthe Agency with identity information directly. Producers of proprietaryinert ingredients may wish to establish with the Agency master files ofthe composition of their products for reference by applicants. The Agencymay require an applicant or registrant to know or ascertain the identityof individual inert ingredients of toxicological concern in their products,regardless of their origin in proprietary mixtures, either for data generationor labeling purposes.Moreover, a registrant will be held responsible for the certified limitsof inert ingredients included in his product only as part of a proprietarymixture (refer to Unit XX.H. for further discussion of certified limits).Section 158.155(c) now describes the required identification informationfor impurities of toxicological significance associated with the activeingredient. Section 158.155(d) describes the information required for otherimpurities associated with the active ingredient and present at levelsgreater than 0.1 percent of the TGAI. These requirements for identificationand certification of impurities apply only to technical grade active ingredientsand products produced by an integrated system. Finally, andSection;158.155(f)addresses ingredients that cannot be characterized chemically because oftheir complexity, or because they are substances for which extensive chemicalanalysis is not practicable.Section 158.155 specifies that a person who formulates a pesticide productis required to provide only information on the active and inert ingredients.A producer of a product by an integrated system (whether it is a manufacuringuse product or end use product) also is required to provide informationon the impurities that may be present in the product.E. Materials Used in Producing the ProductThe Agency proposed that applicants provide certain identifying informationon the materials used in producing the final product. Section 158.160 setsout requirements regarding source materials which, although they are verysimilar to those in andSection;158.155, are not the same. Section 158.112focuses strictly on the identity and quantity of the separate chemicalconstituents of the final product_the active ingredient, inert ingredients,and impurities_that is offered for sale and distribution. Section 158.160,by contrast, addresses information on the actual materials used to makethe product, which may be distinctly different. These are often referredto as the ``recipe'' ingredients of the product.Under andSection;158.160, the applicant is intended to provide informationon the ``recipe'' ingredients of his production or formulation process,including their sources and properties. The ``recipe'' ingredients fora technical grade active ingredient or integrated system product are thestarting materials for the various chemical reactions by which a productcontaining the active ingredient is ultimately produced. The ``recipe''ingredients for a non-integrated system product, however, are those ingredients(whose identity and composition may be proprietary) which are blended tomake the final product. Section 158.160 does not address impurities, sinceimpurities are never intentionally used in the process, but are a resultof the process.Several commenters pointed out that, with respect to inert ingredients,the Agency would receive large amounts of duplicative information, sincethe same inert ingredients are used in a number of products. The Agencyrecognizes that, if producers use the same inert ingredients, EPA willreceive some information that is duplicative. On the other hand, informationcan be incorporated by reference if it has been previously submitted bythe applicant. EPA encourages producers of inert ingredients to establishmaster files which will eliminate much repetitious information.The majority of information required by andSection;andSection;158.155 and 158.160is supplied by completing the Statement of Formula. (current EPA Form 8570-4).EPA is in the process of revising its Statement of Formula form to conformto the requirements of this subpart and other needs of the Agency. Theinformation required by andSection;andSection;158.162 through 158.180 is notamenable to standardized forms, and must be submitted in narrative form.A commenter noted an inconsistency in requiring such extensive informationon an inert ingredient, when elsewhere in the rule (proposed andSection;152.42),the Agency proposed to permit a change in the source of the inert ingredientwithout even notifying the Agency. The Agency has now revised andSection;152.42such that changing the source of an inert ingredient is an action requiringnotification to the Agency (but not approval) only if the Agency originallyrequired such information. Changing the identity of an inert ingredient(including variations in proprietary mixtures of inert ingredients) requiresAgency approval.Another commenter suggested that the Agency undertake to identify inertingredients which are sufficiently well known that no information needbe provided. The commenter sugested that ingredients listed in proposedandSection;158.1001 (recodified as andSection;153.139) be considered for thispurpose. That section defined substances deemed to be inert when used inantimicrobial products. Although the suggestion of the commenter is worthwhile,the substances on the list in andSection;153.139 are not chemicals that couldnecessarily form the basis of such a listing. The commenter assumed thatidentification as an inert ingredient in andSection;153.139 establishes apresumption of knowledge about, and automatic ``clearance'' of, such ingredients;this is not so. The substances listed in andSection;153.139 should not beassumed to be ``cleared'' in any regulatory sense of the word; they havenot been reviewed by the Agency for that purpose. Listing in andSection;153.139merely identifies them as pesticidally inert for purposes of labeling.However, the Agency has developed and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305) an inert ingredientstrategy, under which the Agency categorized pesticide inert ingredientsinto four ``lists'' based upon their potential toxicological concern. List4, which is available from the Agency, contained inert ingredients deemedto be relatively innocuous. The Agency is currently taking no regulatoryaction with respect to ingredients on List 4.F. Production or Formulation ProcessThe Agency proposed to required that applicants provide information ontheir production and formulating processes, including the substances andamounts used, the equipment and conditions of production, and quality controlmeasures. These requirements were based on the information stated in thePesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision D.A number of industry commenters and trade groups objected to the proposedrequirements as being burdensome, needlessly detailed, and of little useto the Agency. Comments from formulators expressed concern that the requirementswere appropriate only for integrated processes involving chemical reactions,not for formulating processes which are essentially blending and dilutionprocesses. They suggested that a different process be put in place forend use products (formulated from registered products) to avoid repetitiouspaperwork.Producers of manufacturing use products and TGAIs also objected. Theirobjections stemmed less from the burden of providing the information thanfrom the possibility that the information will not be available at thetime of application. They stated that the manufacturing process for a pesticideoften is not finalized until after registration. Even large producers oftencontract out the initial manufacture of a new manufacturing use product,until marketing and distribution factors and level of demand justify capitalexpenditure for a full-scale production facility. Thus, they assert, theinformation the Agency is seeking may not be available at the time of application.The Agency is willing to accept initial manufacturing process informationfrom pilot-scale production, with full-scale process information submittedlater. However, the Agency will not accept laboratory bench-scale processinformation.In the final rule, the Agency has defined separately the requirements applicableto the production process (andSection;158.162) and the formulation process(andSection;158.165). EPA agrees that some of the requirements set out inthe proposed rule pertain only to production processes involving chemicalreactions and not to formulation operations that are essentially blendingof ingredients not expected to react. Thus a description of the ``production''process needs to be more detailed and to include more information thana description of the ``formulation'' process.All applicants (whether they use an integrated system, a formulation process,or both) must describe the materials used to produce the product, the typeof process being used, the equipment and physical parameters of the process,and the quality control measures (both operational and analytical) forthe final product.In addition, for an integrated system where a chemical reaction is intendedto occur to produce a TGAI, the reaction process must be described fullywith flow charts and chemical equations, and a description of purificationprocedures. If the reaction process occurs in several distinct steps, withisolated chemical substances produced at each step, andSection;158.162 requiresthat each step be treated as a separate process and documented accordingly.G. Discussion of Formation of ImpuritiesThe Agency proposed that each applicant provide a discussion of the potentialfor formation of impurities in his product, based on information availableto him about the materials he uses and manufacturing process. The Agencystated that it would use the discussion to determine what impurities theapplicant expects to be in his product, to evaluate the possibility ofother impurities and to evaluate the reliability of other data presentedby the applicant. Under the Agency's proposal, an applicant would be expectedto discuss the impurities that, based on chemical theory, might be formedat levels of 0.1 percent or greater in the TGAI.Commenters from industry uniformly objected to the requirement for a discussion.Objections focused primarily on the theoretical nature of the discussion;several commenters suggested that it be limited to ``expected'' reactionsrather than ``possible'' reactions, or that it deal only with known byproductsand impurities. Producers of TGAIs and manufacturing use products assertedthat, because of the complexity of the chemical reactions, it would betime-consuming to construct the discussion across the entire productionprocess and that it would not serve the purposes intended.The Agency disagrees with the argument that the information will not beuseful. Some of the risks posed by an pesticide result from the presenceof impurities or contaminants rather than (or in addition to) the activeingredients or inert ingredients. In some cases, impurities pose the moresignificant risks, particularly when chronic health effects are considered.For example, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, which are common impuritiesin the manufacture of some pesticides, are known to be potent carcinogens.The Agency cannot conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of a pesticidewithout considering the possibility that toxic impurities may be formed.One common outcome of current Agency reviews is the requirement that registrantsanalyze their products to determine the presence and levels of toxic impurities.EPA believes that an early discussion of the possibility of impuritiesmight preclude a requirement for more inclusive analysis of products. Thediscussion may alleviate Agency concerns or demonstrate that, althoughtheoretically possible, impurities are not likely to be produced in anapplicant's particular production process. Thus EPA has not modified thefinal rule. The final rule provides that a producer using an integrated system mustaddress impurities that are found actually found by analysis in his product,and also those that theoretically might be present based on establishedchemical theory. The magnitude and depth of the theoretical discussionare not prescribed in the rule, merely the topics that should be addressed.In all cases, the discussion is limited to the applicant's knowledge; heis not expected to seek out information he could not reasonably know orhave access to. A registrant is not expected to provide a sophisticatedor exhaustive treatment of theoretical impurities that are not toxicologicallysignificant. However, if an impurity has actually been found by analysis,or if an impurity of toxicological concern is postulated to be formed,the Agency will expect a significantly more comprehensive discussion. Comments from formulators also expressed concern at the Agency's proposal.The commenters questioned the need for any discussion of impurity formationfor formulated products. They stated that the formulation process is intendedto produce a stable product, and asserted that chemical reactions amongthe components are virtually unknown. Moreover, they noted that informationon the identity of impurities in they active and inert ingredients theypurchase is rarely, if ever, available to them, so that the would be unableto provide the information in any case. As stated earlier, andSection; 158.175 of the final rule is clear on thispoint: the discussion is to be based on information available to the formulator.Thus, the formulator is not required to seek information on the identityor level of impurities in his source products. If provided with such informationby his supplier, a formulator should consider it in his discussion. Sinceinformation on the impurities in a registered source TGAI will be availableto the Agency from the registrant of that source product, duplication ofthe information serves no purpose. Other elements of a discussion for a formulated product, however, are concernedwith reactions that could occur in the formulation process_reactions betweenactive and inert ingredients, reactions between the product and its packaging,and migration of contaminants into the pesticide. These are topics whichonly the formulator can address. If the applicant does not believe it likelythat any possible sources of impurity or contamination will materializein his formulation process, his discussion need only explain why this isso. EPA agrees with commenters that the formulation process is less likelyto involve chemical reactions that result in impurities; nonetheless, thepossibility cannot be dismissed or ignored. In any case, EPA does not believethat the required discussion will be a protracted, time-consuming or burdensomeprocess for formulators, since the majority of impurities in formulatedproducts are present as a result of carryover from the active ingredientsource, of which the formulator's knowledge may be limited. One commenter misinterpreted the discussion requirement for non-intergratedsystem products as requiring analysis of each product at the 0.1 percentlevel and stated that formulators do not have laboratory capability atthat level. Formulators not using an integrated system are not requiredto analyze their products to determine impurities qualitatively or quantitatively.By contrast, producers who use an integrated system are required by andSection;158.170 to provide the Agency with a preliminary analysis of the TGAI tothe 0.1 percent level. The producer of a TGAI or integrated system productis required to address each impurity found in that analysis at a levelof 0.1 percent or greater of the TGAI. Moreover, if a producer has reasonto believe that the TGAI may contain nitrosamine, dibenzodioxin or dibenzofuranimpurities, he is expected to analyze below the 0.1 percent level, in accordancewith the Agency's policy statement on nitrosamines (42 FR 51640, September29, 1977) and its final rule (under the Toxic Substances Control Act) ondibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (52 FR 21412, June 5, 1987).H. Certification of LimitsThe Agency proposed essentially the same certification of limits requirementsas are contained in current andSection; 158.110. In brief, the Agency proposedto require the certification of:1. Upper and lower limits for active ingredients.2. Upper limits for inert ingredients (the omission of lower limits wasunintentional and has been corrected in the final rule).3. Upper limits for impurities at any level that are determined to be toxicologicallysignificant.4. Upper limits for other impurities associated with the active ingredientat levels of 0.1 percent or greater. Impurities were to be certified ifthey were postulated to be present or if they were found by analysis ofthe product.Comments on the certification requirements were received from five industrysources and one environmental group. Most commenters noted that the requirementswere redundant to those in Part 158. EPA acknowledges this, but chose torepropose the requirements for completeness and organization purposes.In the final rule, all product chemistry requirements have been consolidatedinto Part 158, eliminating the redundancy.Industry commenters were unanimous in objecting to the reproposed certificationrequirements, even though they were unchanged from those in current Part158. A number of commenters repeated comments made at the time of initialproposal of these requirements (in 1982). In particular, several commentersaddressed the requirement for certified limits for inert ingredients, andthe possibility that applicants would have to develop costly analyticalmethods and capability to support those limits. The Agency has not changedits position on the requirement for upper and lower certified limits foractive and inert ingredients, and does not believe it necessary to reiterateits responses to those comments. Readers are referred to the preamble tothe final Part 158 rule, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 24, 1984 (49 FR 42862), for a discussionof comments concerning certified limits for inert ingredients, and thelevel of analysis required in support of those limits.The Agency has adopted the suggestion of a commenter that standardizedcertified limits for active and inert ingredients be established, takinginto account acceptable deviations in analytical techniques and concentrationfactors. An applicant would have the choice of using the Agency's standardcertified limits or of proposing his own certified limits, as was requiredby the proposal. The commenter suggested that the guidelines establishedby the American Association of Pesticide Control Officials be consideredas the basis for the standard limits. The Agency considered those guidelines,but has adopted different limits. Section 158.175 now provides that, foractive and inert ingredients, the applicant may propose certified limitsor may use the standard certified limits set out in andSection; 158.175(b)(2).Standard certified limits are not appropriate for impurities for whicha certified upper limit is required; the applicant must propose such limits.Since impurities are not intentionally added to a product, their levelscannot be predicted to fall within standardized limits. Moreover, impuritiesare intended to be minimized, and the Agency does not believe it shouldsanction their presence at predetermined levels.An applicant is not required to use the standard limits. They are providedas an alternative to applicant-proposed certified limits, as a convenienceto applicants. If an applicant chooses not to use the standard certifiedlimits, he may propose wider (or narrower) limits. If wider, the applicantis strongly urged to include in his application a discussion of those limitsand why he has selected them. A thorough discussion of the basis for differentlimits may avoid the Agency's questioning the applicant's proposed limits.With respect to impurities, current andSection; 158.190 and the proposedrule require that upper certified limits be established for impuritiesthat are potentially present in the TGAI (as indicated in the discussionrequired by andSection; 158.167). As a result of the comments received, theAgency has reexamined its requirements for certified limits for impurities,and has made significant changes in the final rule.First, the Agency has eliminated the requirement for an upper certifiedlimit for impurities that are not toxicologically significant. The requirementfor a statement of the nominal concentration for such impurities when associatedwith the active ingredient has been retained in andSection; 158.155(d). Second,the Agency has eliminated the requirement for certified limits on theoreticalimpurities in the formulation. An upper certified limit for toxic impuritieswill routinely be required only if shown by analysis of the product tobe present.The applicant is required to sign a certification statement agreeing thathe will maintain his product's composition within the certified limitsapproved by the Agency. The certified limits approved by the Agency willbe used for enforcement purposes. Moreover, although the Agency has establishedstandard certified limits which should be acceptable for most products,the Agency reserves the right to reject those limits for an individualproduct, and to require the applicant to propose new limits.A formulator should be aware that in formulating a product and certifyingits active and inert ingredient ranges, he may have to adjust his formulationprocess to account for the permitted variability of the active ingredientin the source products he purchases. For example, a formulator may producea product nominally containing 45 percent active ingredient by dilutinga 90 percent nominal concentration technical product on a 1:1 basis. Thestandard certified limits would permit the technical grade active ingredientto vary from 87.3 to 92.7 percent. The forumulated product may thereforecontain only 43.7 percent active ingredient if the formulator is usingsource product at the lower certified limit, assuming optimal formulationconditions and manufacturing practices. If the formulator assumes the standardcertified limit of 3 percent, his product (nominally at 45 percent) willjust barely meet the lower certified limit, and is at risk of being inviolation of FIFRA if his formulation process is less than optimal.EPA urges formulators to be aware of the percentage of active ingredientactually contained in the source products they purchase. Each registrantwill be held accountable for the certified limits of his product.The responsibility of the registrant to adhere to the certified limitsextends to individual inert ingredients. The fact that the applicant usesa proprietary mixture of substances whose composition is not known to himdoes not remove his responsibility for maintaining the composition of eachof those inert ingredients within its certified limits.Although EPA encourages the free and open exchange of information betweenproducers of inert ingredients and their customers, it recognizes thatproducers' concerns about trade secrecy may prevent their customers fromobtaining this information. Therefore, the Agency normally will not requirethat an applicant know the composition of a proprietary mixture of inertingredients in order to obtain registration; he is, however, required toensure that the Agency is informed of the mixture's composition by itsproducer. If a component of the proprietary mixture is an inert ingredientof toxicological concern, the agency may require that the applicant obtaininformation about purchased inert ingredients, so that the product maybe labeled properly. Otherwise, the Agency may have to deny or cancel registrationof the product.In addition, the Agency holds the applicant responsible for the certifiedlimits of each inert ingredient in his product, including those that arepresent as part of a proprietary mixture. An applicant who does not knowthe composition of an inert ingredient, and cannot persuade his supplieror producer to disclose it, may certify to an upper and lower limit ofthe ingredient as introduced into his product as a whole. In this case,the Agency will apply the certified limits of the ingredient as a wholeto the individual substances comprising the ingredient, as disclosed bythe supplier directly to the Agency. The applicant is responsible for maintaininghis product within those Agency-derived limits.A formulator who is uncomfortable with the extent of responsibility implicitin this policy should take steps to decrease the uncertainties, eitherby gaining knowledge of the composition of inert mixtures or by assuringthat the composition of the mixture he uses will not change over time.EPA believes that a contractual arrangement between formulator and supplieris the best way to ensure that the formulator can rely on the compositionof the material received, short of having direct knowledge of its composition. Two commenters questioned the lack of criteria for determining ``toxicologicalsignificance'' of impurities. One suggested that the Agency issue a listof toxicologically significant impurities. The consequence of identificationas an impurity of toxicological significance is that, under andSection;158.175of the final rule, an applicant must supply an upper certified limit foreach such impurity in a TGAI or integrated system product, and, under andSection;158.180,an analytical method suitable for enforcement of the certified limit. Impuritiesnot identified as being of toxicological significance must be identifiedat levels greater than 0.1 percent of the TGAI, and a nominal concentrationmust be provided, but a certified upper limit is not required.   In response to the comment, the Agency has identified in two ways impuritiesfor which it believes that certified limits are necessary. The first isa list of specific substances or classes of substances of known toxicologicalconcern. In some cases, the listed substances are currently or have beenthe subject of regulatory action against pesticide products because ofthe risks posed by their presence as impurities in the product. In othercases, they are identified because historically they are known to contributesignificantly to the toxic profile of an active ingredient. For example,the oxygen analogs of organophosphate pesticides may be more toxic thanthe parent compound and must be considered in setting tolerances for thetoxicologically active components of the pesticide.  The second is a set of criteria for substances which are potentially oftoxicological significance; in this latter list, no specific substancesare named. While substances meeting the criteria of this second list arenot necessarily hazardous, nor have risks associated with their presencebeen quantified in any specific instance, they are typical of the typesof impurities that the Agency has found to be of significance in the past. <ITAG tagnum="81">Impurities and classes of impurities of toxicological concern  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ethylene thiourea (ETU)  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) and other chlorinated diphenylethanes and ethylenes, such as analogs and isomers of DDT, DDD, DDE andCl-DDT (``extrachloro DDT'') </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sulfotepp </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Halogenated dibenzodioxins </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Halogenated dibenzofurans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Nitrosamines </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Biphenyl ethers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Anilines and substituted anilines </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Hydrazines </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Oxygen analogs of organophosphates </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sulfoxides and sulfones of organophosphates and carbamates </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Impurities having characteristics of potential toxicological significance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Any impurity that is structurally related to the parent compound andis not known to be toxicologically insignificant </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Any impurity that is also an active ingredient </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Any impurity that is identified in standard toxicology data basessuch as Toxline as being teratogenic, oncogenic or neurotoxic</ITAG>This list is not exhaustive, and EPA does not intend it to be. The listmay be expanded as new information on impurities becomes available. Forthat reason, the list is not included in the final rule. EPA will updatethe list periodically, and make it available to registrants and the public,or may publish it in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>EPA has reserved the right to require certifiedlimits for other impurities on a case-by-case basis. Registrants shouldcontact the Agency if there is a question about the status of any individualimpurity not listed.  It should be emphasized that the certification of limits for impuritiesof toxicological significance as part of the registration or reregistrationprocess does not imply that the Agency seeks to take regulatory actionbased upon the presence of the impurity or its level in a product. Thecertified limits will permit EPA to monitor the continued stability ofthe manufacturing process, and will foster improved processes to furtherlimit the presence of toxic impurities.On the other hand, if the Agency has not quantified the risks associatedwith a particular impurity, it will not take regulatory action merely becausethe applicant certifies the limits of that impurity in his product. Ina particular active ingredient and use context, the certified limits willbe used to determine the risk posed by the impurity. The Agency would thenundertake its risk/benefit balancing process to determine whether thatrisk is unreasonable.If any of these substances is found to be present at any level in any TGAIused in or produced by an integrated system product, the applicant mustprovide an upper certified limit. Certified limits are not required forimpurities other than those listed or meeting the criteria; however, anominal concentration is required for each other impurity found to be presentat a level greater than 0.1 percent of the TGAI if the impurity is associatedwith an active ingredient. Routine requirements for certification of limitsfor impurities of inert ingredients are not described in this final rule,but under andSection; 158.175(a)(4), the Agency has reserved the right torequire that certified limits be set for other ingredients in a pesticideproduct, including if warranted, impurities derived from inert ingredients.Such requirements are imposed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance withthe inerts policy notice of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305).The need to certify limits of impurities does not require that a produceranalyze a product to any greater extent than he is otherwise required todo. A producer of a TGAI or an integrated system product is required byandSection; 158.170 to analyze the TGAI in his product to the 0.1 percentlevel and provide the results of those analyses to the Agency. Certificationof limits of identified impurities found in those analyses, and identificationof the nominal concentration of other impurities found at greater than0.1 percent are analogous reporting requirements derived from the sameanalyses.I. Enforcement Analytical MethodNo comments were received on the proposed requirements for an enforcementanalytical method for active ingredients and other toxicologically significantingredients. Accordingly, andSection; 158.180 has been adopted as proposed.J. Conforming ChangesThe Agency has made two conforming changes in the final rule. First, aspecific certification statement has been provided in andSection; 158.175(d).Since certified limits are legally enforceable, the Agency believes itessential not only that product composition and certified limits be established,but also that the registrant promise that his product will conform to thoselimits at all times during sale and distribution.Second, the table in andSection; 158.190(a) has been revised to delete therequirements that are now contained in andSection;andSection; 158.150 through158.180 in narrative form.

Statutory Requirements</ITAG>In accordance with FIFRA sec. 25(a), a draft of this final rule was submittedto the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP),and the House Committee on Agriculture and Senate Committee on Agriculture,Nutrition and Forestry for comment. The SAP waived its formal review ofthe final rule. The Congressional Committees did not comment on the rule.The Department of Agriculture, although not objecting to the use of theterm ``unclassified'' for a pesticide that has not been restricted, believedthat such pesticides are essentially classified for general use, and thata determination by the Agency to restrict the pesticide's use should beconsidered a change in classification for the purposes of FIFRA sec. 6.EPA disagrees. EPA does not regard the initial classification of a productor use that was previously unclassified as a change in classification.The Agency's decision to restrict a product's use can be made and announcedin a number of regulatory and non-regulatory contexts, including SpecialReview, issuance of a Registration Standard, or case-by-case reviews ofindividual products. EPA may use the procedures of FIFRA sec. 3(d)(2),under which the registrant and the public are given notice of a changein classification, or EPA may initiate a hearing or cancellation processunder FIFRA sec. 6(b).If a registrant agrees with, or does not contest, the Agency's decisionto restrict the product's use(s), the restriction is implemented. However,if a registrant disagrees with the Agency's decision, EPA can compel compliancewith its decision only by using the cancellation procedures of FIFRA sec.6(b), which provides for 60-day notice to and comment by the Departmentof Agriculture before taking action, and hearing rights for registrants.<ITAG tagnum="84">XXIII. Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order (E.O.) 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.The Agency determined at the time of proposal that this final rule revisingand reorganizing Part 162 is not a major regulation as defined by E.O.12291. This final rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor review as required by E.O. 12291.Regulatory Flexibility ActThis final rule was reviewed against the provisions of section 3(a) ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act and it was determined that it does not containprovisions which would have a significant adverse impact on a substantialnumber of small entities, and I hereby certify that a separate RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis is not required.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the informationcollection requirements contained in this final rule under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and hasassigned OMB Control Numbers 2070-0057 and 2070-0060.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 152, 153, 156, 158, and 162</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Data requirements, Environmentalprotection, Intergovernmental relations, Labeling, Pesticides and pests,Policy statements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

Criteria and procedures for the special reviewprocess are contained in Part 154 of this chapter.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 152.148</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Cancellation of registration.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Grounds for cancellation. </T3>The Agency may issue a notice of intentto cancel the registration of a product or to cancel the registration unlessit is amended as specified in the notice, if the Agency determines thatany of the following criteria has been met:(1) Under FIFRA sec. 6(b), the pesticide, its labeling, or other materialrequired to be submitted, does not comply with the Act. For example, theAgency may propose cancellation if a registrant fails to comply with arequirement that a product bear restricted use labeling, or if a registrantsubmits to the Agency a false statement concerning compliance of a studywith the Good Laboratory Practices requirements of Part 160 of this chapter.(2) Under FIFRA sec. 6(b), the pesticide, when used in accordance withwidespread and commonly recognized practice, generally causes unreasonableadverse effects on the environment;(3) Under FIFRA sec. 6(e), a registrant fails to initiate or pursue appropriateaction toward meeting any conditions imposed on the registration;(4) Under FIFRA sec. 6(c), a registrant fails to meet any conditions imposedon the registration; (5) Under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(D)(ii), the Agency determines, based upona petition by an original data submitter, that a registrant has failedto comply with the requirements of Subpart E of this Part concerning compensationfor use of data. Such cancellations are governed by the procedures of andSection;152.99,and are not subject to the procedures of this section. (b) <T3>Notice of intent to cancel. </T3>The Agency will notify the registrantby certified mail at the address of record of the Agency's intent to cancel,and will state the reasons for the proposed cancellation. The Agency willalso issue in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a notice of its intent to cancel a registration.(c) <T3>Opportunity for corrections. </T3>The registrant may, within 30 daysof his receipt of the notice or publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, whichever is later, make any corrections identifiedin the notice. If he does so, the cancellation action will not become final.(d) <T3>Hearing_</T3>(1) <T3>Requested by a registrant. </T3>A registrant may, within 30 days ofhis receipt of a notice of intent to cancel, or publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, whichever is later, request that a hearing beheld. The registrant may request a hearing on any or all of the Agency'srequirements, as stated in the Agency's notice of intent to cancel. Theregistrant must state in his request the specific requirements he objectsto, and the reasons for his objection. He need not comply with the requirementsin dispute until a final hearing decision has been issued. The registrantmust, however, within the timeframes specified, comply with all other Agencyrequirements that are not at issue. (2) <T3>Requested by another person. </T3>Any other person adversely affectedby a proposed cancellation may, within 30 days of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, request that a hearing be held. The requestmust identify in what manner the person is adversely affected by the Agency'sproposed cancellation. (3) <T3>Initiated by the Agency. </T3>Under FIFRA sec. 6(b)(2), in lieu ofissuing a notice of intent to cancel, the Agency may hold a hearing todetermine whether a registration should be cancelled. (4) <T3>Hearing procedures. </T3>A hearing will be conducted according to FIFRAsec. 6(d) or 6(e) and Part 164 of this chapter. (e) <T3>Effective date of cancellation. </T3>(1) If a hearing request is notreceived in a timely manner and the registrant fails to make required correctionsin a timely manner, the cancellation shall be effective at the end of 30days from the date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> or receipt by the registrant, whichever is later.(2) If a hearing is held to challenge the cancellation, and thereafterthe cancellation is sustained, or if the Agency holds a hearing in whichit is concluded that a registration should be cancelled, the cancellationshall be effective immediately upon issuance of the final Agency orderin the proceeding. (f) <T3>Effect of cancellation. </T3>After the effective date of cancellation,distribution or sale of a cancelled product, except in accordance withthe terms of the notice of cancellation, will be considered a violationof FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(A) or 12(a)(2)(K). The Agency will specify in theorder of final cancellation whether existing stocks of the product maybe distributed or sold, what conditions of distribution, sale, and use(if any) have been established, and the date after which such distributionor sale will no longer be permitted. (g) <T3>Reinstatement of registration. </T3>The Agency will reinstate a cancelledregistration if the registrant can show that the cancellation was the resultof Agency clerical or administative error. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 152.150 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Suspension of registration.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Grounds for suspension. </T3>The Agency may issue a notice of intentto suspend the registration of a product if: (1) Under FIFRA sec. 6(c)(1), the Agency determines that suspension isnecessary in order to prevent an imminent hazard during the time necessaryfor cancellation or change in classification proceedings.(2) Under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(2)(B), a registrant has failed, within the timerequired by the Agency: (i) To take appropriate steps to provide information necessary for continuedregistration;(ii) To participate in a procedure for reaching agreement concerning jointdevelopment of data or in an arbitration proceeding; or (iii) To comply with the terms of any agreement or arbitration decision.(b) <T3>Suspension order. </T3>The Agency may issue a suspension order if:(1) The registrant who has received a notice of intent to suspend failsto request a hearing in a timely manner; (2) A hearing is held, and the suspension is sustained; or(3) Under FIFRA sec. 6(c)(3), the Agency determines that an emergency existswhich warrants immediate suspension.

However, classification reviews normally willbe conducted and products classified only in the following circumstances:(1) As part of the review of an application for new registration of a productcontaining an active ingredient not contained in any currently registeredproduct.(2) As part of the review of an application for a new use of a product,if existing uses of that product previously have been classified for restricteduse. Review of a restricted use product at this time is for the purposeof determining whether the new use should also be classified for restricteduse. Normally the Agency will not conduct initial classification reviewsfor existing uses of individual products in conjunction with an applicationfor amended registration.(3) As part of the process of developing or amending a registration standardfor a pesticide. The Agency normally will conduct classification reviewsof all uses of a currently registered pesticide at this time.(4) As part of any special review of a pesticide, in accordance with theprocedures of 40 CFR Part 154.(c) <T3>Classification procedures.</T3> (1) If the Agency determines that aproduct or one or more of its uses should be classified for restricteduse, the Agency initially may classify the product by regulation. In thiscase, within 60 days after the effective date of a final rule, each registrantof a product subject to the rule must submit to the Agency one of the following,as directed in the final rule:(i) A copy of the amended label and any supplemental labeling to be usedas an interim compliance measure.(ii) A statement, which the Agency considers a report under the Act, thatthe registrant will comply with the labeling requirements prescribed bythe Agency within the timeframes prescribed by the regulation.(iii) An application for amended registration to delete the uses whichhave been restricted, or to ``split'' the registration into two registrations,one including only restricted or all uses, and the other including onlyuses that have not been classified.(2) Alternatively, EPA may notify the applicant or registrant of the classificationdecision and require that he submit the information required by paragraph(c)(1) of this section.

References in this subpart to the ``applicant''include the registrant if the information is required for a registeredproduct.(b) <T3>Purpose</T3>_(1) <T3>Product composition.</T3> (i) Data on product composition are neededto support the conclusions expressed in the statement of formula. Thesedata include information on the starting materials, production or formulatingprocess, possible formation of impurities, results of preliminary analysisof product samples, a description of analytical methods to identify andquantify ingredients and validation data for such methods. In addition,an applicant is required to certify the limits for ingredients of his product.(ii) Product composition data are compared to the composition of materialsused in required testing under Subpart D of this part. This comparisonindicates which components of a pesticide product have been evaluated bya particular study, and might lead to a conclusion that another study isneeded. Based on conclusions concerning the product's composition and itstoxic properties, appropriate use restrictions, labeling requirements,or special packaging requirements may be imposed.(iii) Product composition data, including certified limits of components,are used to determine whether a product is ``identical or substantiallysimilar'' to another product or ``differs only in ways that do not significantlyincrease the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment''(FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(A)). In nearly every case, this determination involvesa comparison of the composition of an applicant's product with that ofcurrently registered products.(2) <T3>Certified limits.</T3> Certified limits required by andSection;158.175are used in two ways. First, the Agency considers the certified limitsin making the registration determination required by sections 3(c)(5),3(c)(7) and 3(d) of the Act and making other regulatory decisions requiredby the Act. Second, the Agency may collect commercial samples of the registeredproducts and analyze them for the active ingredient(s), inert ingredients,or impurities determined by the Agency to be toxicologically significant.If, upon analysis the composition of such a sample is found to differ fromthat certified, the results may be used by the Agency in regulatory actionsunder FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(C) and other pertinent sections.(3) <T3>Nominal concentration.</T3> The nominal concentration required by andSection;158.155is the amount of active ingredient that is most likely to be present inthe product when produced. Unlike the certified limits, which are the outerlimits of the range of the product's ingredients and thus are present onlyin a small proportion of the products, the nominal concentration is theamount that typically is expected to result from the applicant's productionor formulating process. The nominal concentration together with productionprocess information is used to gauge the acceptability of the certifiedlimits presented by the applicant. The nominal concentration is used bythe Agency as the basis for enforceable certified limits if the applicanthas chosen not to specify certified limits of his own (thereby agreeingto abide by the standard limits in andSection;158.175).(4) <T3>Physical and chemical characteristics.</T3> (i) Data on the physicaland chemical characteristics of pesticide active ingredients and productsare used to confirm or provide supportive information on their identity.Such data are also used in reviewing the production or formulating processused to produce the pesticide or product. For example, data that indicatesignificant changes in production or formulation might indicate the needfor additional information on product composition.(ii) Certain information (e.g., color, odor, physical state) is neededfor the Agency to respond to emergency requests for identification of unlabeledpesticides involved in accidents or spills. Physicians, hospitals, andpoison control centers also request this information to aid in their identificationof materials implicated in poisoning episodes.(iii) Certain physical and chemical data are used directly in the hazardassessment. These include stability, oxidizing and reducing action, flammability,explodability, storage stability, corrosion, and dielectric breakdown voltage.For example, a study of the corrosion characteristics of a pesticide isneeded to evaluate effects of the product formulation on its container.If the pesticide is highly corrosive, measures can be taken to ensure thatlids, liners, seams or container sides will not be damaged and cause thecontents to leak during storage, transport, handling, or use. The storagestability study provides data on change (or lack of change) in productcomposition over time. If certain ingredients decompose, other new chemicalsare formed whose toxicity and other characteristics must be considered.(iv) Certain data are needed as basic or supportive evidence in initiatingor evaluating other studies. For example, the octanol/water partition coefficientis used as one of the criteria to determine whether certain fish and wildlifetoxicity or accumulation studies must be conducted. Vapor pressure dataare needed, among other things, to determine suitable reentry intervalsand other label cautions pertaining to worker protection. Data on viscosityand miscibility provide necessary information to support acceptable labelingfor tank mix and spray applications.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;158.153 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>The following terms are defined for the purposes of this subpart: (a) ``Active ingredient'' means any substance (or group of structurallysimilar substances, if specified by the Agency) that will prevent, destroy,repel or mitigate any pest, or that functions as a plant regulator, desiccant,or defoliant within the meaning of FIFRA sec. 2(a).
