The DIG/GPIA system will allownatural gas engine-power and thermal-efficiency improvement of up to50% and 13%, respectively, compared to current natural gas engines. Conceptdesign of a commercial Caterpillar 3500 Series DIG/GPIA natural gas enginehas been made. This includes concept design of a gas injector, a cylinderhead incorporating the glow-plug ignition-assist system, and a gas-compressorsystem. An economic analysis shows a significant economic potential forthe direct-injected natural gas engine over the conventional naturalgas engine.</TEXT></DOC>
