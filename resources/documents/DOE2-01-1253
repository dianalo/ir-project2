<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-1253 </DOCNO><TEXT>The STATEN code, which models velocity and temperature fields in singlephase turbulent flow, has been developed to assess the potential of temperaturefluctuation (noise) monitoring for the detection of pin bundle blockagesprior to boiling. A brief outline of the model is given, together withverification against experimental tests in various geometries, includingrecent comparison with European jet block experiments. STATEN modellingof a CDFR subassembly outlet region is described, and predicted temperaturedistributions at the proposed sensor position, resulting from a limitednumber of blockage sizes in the pin bundle, are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
