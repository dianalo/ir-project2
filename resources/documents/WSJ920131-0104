The study, to be released in Geneva today, proposescreation of a global Environmental Protection Agency, whichwould issue pollution allowances that could then be traded bypolluters and others. It also recommends creation ofexchange-based and over-the-counter futures and optionsmarkets in the pollution rights.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Obviously, this can't be ready in six months,&quot; said FrankJoshua, economic affairs officer for the United NationsConference on Trade and Development. &quot;It would have to bediscussed by governments of the Conference on Trade andDevelopment and, eventually, by the U.N. itself.&quot; Yet theproposal could set a global precedent of using financialmarkets to clean the environment, Mr. Joshua said.   Growing numbers of scientists believe that the Earth'stemperature within 50 years will climb to dangerous levels,eventually leading to coastal flooding, severe storms anddrought. Carbon-dioxide pollution from factories, powergenerators and automobiles is thought to be the biggestsingle contributor to global warming.   At a meeting today in Geneva, the secretary-general of theU.N. Conference on Trade and Development will release thestudy, titled &quot;Trading Entitlements to Control CarbonEmissions: a Practical Proposal to Combat Global Warming.&quot;   Its recommendations are similar to the contents of the1990 U.S. Clean Air Act, which imposes a market-based systemof reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant thatproduces acid rain. In a departure from traditionalregulatory methods, Congress gave polluters the right to meetgovernment pollution limits by buying and sellingsulfur-dioxide allowances. The U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency says the program will force electricity-generatingutilities to cut sulfur-dioxide pollution in half by the year2000.   Private markets such as the Chicago Board of Trade areworking on plans to run the EPA's sulfur dioxide allowancemarket. William F. O'Connor, CBOT chairman, said through aspokesman that his exchange also would be interested inrunning a market in international carbon dioxide allowances.   The commodities industry has adapted markets once intendedfor agricultural products such as grains and livestock totrade everything from stocks and bonds to foreign currencies.Pollution rights will be the industry's next major area ofinnovation, effectively turning air and water intocommodities, predicts Richard L. Sandor, an economist andCBOT director who coauthored the U.N. study.   &quot;Air and water are simply no longer the `free goods' thateconomists once assumed,&quot; Mr. Sandor said. &quot;They must beredefined as property rights so that they can be efficientlyallocated.&quot;   Here's how the proposed international pollution-rightstrading system would work:   Each allowance would entitle a company to emit one ton ofcarbon dioxide a year; the allowances would be traded inbundles of 100, permitting 100 tons of carbon dioxidepollution. Each polluting company in participating countrieswould get a certain number of allowances a year and could buyadditional allowances as needed.   The number of allowances issued would be tightlycontrolled by the global EPA, and reduced over a period ofyears. Inefficient companies that belch huge quantities ofcarbon dioxide would face increasingly steep payments for theallowances they needed, while cleaner companies could make aprofit by selling their allowances on the open market.   One obstacle the proposal faces is skepticism among someenvironmentalists, who say allowing companies to buy theright to pollute is immoral. Others predict an organizationalnightmare in trying to harness into a single system nationsat varying stages of economic development and with vastlydifferent environmental laws.   &quot;We are a long way from being able to define pollution asa commodity to be traded and develop the necessary monitoringand measurement schemes,&quot; said Mary Nichols, senior lawyerfor the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based,non-profit environmental group.   Under the U.N. study, the first phase of the carbondioxide program would target the countries whose industriesare the biggest carbon-dioxide polluters. These would includethe U.S., Great Britain, Germany and former Eastern bloccountries such as Russia and Belarus, which generate much oftheir electrical power by burning coal. But scientists saythat efforts to reduce pollution at such fixed sites won't besufficient to curtail global warming unless auto emissionsare sharply lowered.</TEXT></DOC>
