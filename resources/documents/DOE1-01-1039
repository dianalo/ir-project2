From these, which were all published before the Chernobyldisaster, the reviewer identifies two main problems relating to nuclearenergy - immediate safety and disposal of nuclear waste. Risk analysisis seen as unhelpful in allaying public fears as it is the nature ofthe risk of nuclear accidents, rather than its numerical probability,that is frightening. A paper on the assessment of Best Practical EnvironmentalOptions (BPEO) for management of low and intermediate-level solid radioactivewaste, is referred to when commenting on nuclear waste disposal. Ordinarypeople have two political obligations with respect to nuclear energy- first to demand knowledge and examine further reassuring information.Risks taken will then be taken with proper information obtained first.Secondly, to look beyond the short-term consequences of a nuclear programme.To fulfill these obligations policy-makers have to be educated to beopen and honest about the nuclear future and to be seen to be lookingfurther ahead than the immediate future.
