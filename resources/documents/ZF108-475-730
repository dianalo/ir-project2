Main, Fifth Floor, Salt Lake City, UT84144; (801) 531-0600.andM;InBox Plus 3.0andM;InBox from TOPS is an above-average E-mail package that runs on its own mailserver or on top of AppleShare or TOPS.andP;  Servers can include Macs, PCs, Sunworkstations, VAXes, and other platforms.andP;  Both Macs and PCs can be clients.andO;Workstation InBox allows 20 users per server and is bundled free with TOPS.andO;InBox Plus allows 100 users, plus server-to-server communications.andP;  Messagesare duplicated for each addressee, but enclosed files are stored only once(saving both time and space).andP;  Message forms include only Memo and Phone; itsupports mailboxes, groups, user-configurable passwords, and storage boxes.andO;Messages can be sorted by subject, sender, status, and date, or selected bycharacter string.andP;  InBox finished third in our performance tests.andM;Pros: Easy setup and excellent manuals.andP;  Unlimited file enclosure.andP;  Rememberswindow positions.andM;Cons: Multiple-addressee sends go out from user.andP;  No custom forms.andP;  Nokeyboard loading of recipient names.andM;List Price: 100 users, $995.andM;TOPS, 950 Marina Village Parkway, Alameda, CA 94501; (415) 769-9669.andM;Microsoft Mail 2.0andM;Microsoft Mail offers a mix of functions with Mac and VAX servers, overlocal-area networks and larger internets.andP;  An efficient single-instancestorage scheme is used for messages and enclosures to multiple addressees.andO;User directories are automatically propagated.andP;  The mail server automaticallyreclaims disk space when messages are deleted.andP;  Features include keyboardname entry for messages, customizable forms, image display and voice-mailsupport, and interapplication communication with Excel and Word.andP;  MicrosoftMail edged out QuickMail in most of our performance tests.andM;Pros: Clean interface.andP;  Simple to install, maintain, and use.andP;  Automaticpropagation of user directories.andP;  Quick keyboard loading of recipients.andO;Efficient database server.andP;  Customizable forms.andM;Cons: No multiple-file enclosures.andP;  No local folder storage.andP;  No searching orsorting of messages.andM;List Price: Mail Server, $395; 1 to 4 users, $125; 20-Pak, $1,495; PCWorkstation, $125.andM;Microsoft Corp., One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052; (206) 882-8080.andM;QuickMail 2.2.2andM;QuickMail from CE Software takes first place in the features contest andfinished a close second to Microsoft Mail 2.0 in our speed trials.andP;  Macs andPCs can be used as clients.andP;  An inefficient multiple-addressee scheme thatreplicates messages and enclosures on the server hits performance hard in abusy environment.andP;  Messages can be sorted by priority, subject, recipient, ordate; folders can be created for local storage.andP;  Sixteen files can beenclosed per message.andP;  Each user can establish a personal Mail Log to keeptrack of messages and can unsend and unread messages.andP;  Users can customizeforms.andP;  Voice-mail is supported, as is real-time conferencing.andM;Pros: Powerful user tools, highly configurable.andP;  Multiple file enclosures.andO;Customizable forms.andM;Cons: Busy interface.andP;  Disk-hungry server.andP;  Extensive disk fragmentation withheavy use.andP;  Minor bugs.andM;List Price: 1 user, $189.95; 5 users, $339.95; 10 users, $499.95; 50 users,$2,299.95.andM;CE Software, 1854 Fuller Road, P.O. Box 65580, West Des Moines, 1A 50265;(800) 523-7638.andM;Electronic mail on the Mac is only five years old -- a fairly long life,considering that the Mac itself just celebrated its sixth birthday.andP;  But it'sbeen an active five years for E-mail, as this messaging and file-sharingoffice necessity has come to be known.andP;  Features and performance haveimproved while different delivery strategies fight for market dominance.andP;  Anddevelopers aren't standing still.andP;  Hosts of new features are promised forfuture releases: electronic report distribution, archival services, computerconferencing, and forms-routing systems, to name a few.andM;Whether or not these future features materialize, E-mail users will always beconcerned with one central issue -- getting the mail through fast.andP;  MacUserNetWorkShop dissected five major Mac E-mail products to test how well theyresponded to this eternal need.andP;  We asked two basic questions: How do E-mailproducts work? and how does their structure affect performance?andM;We tested cc:Mail from cc:Mail, Inc.; DaynaMAIL from Dayna Communications;InBox Plus from TOPS (WorkStation InBox, for 20 users, comes bundled withTOPS; InBox Plus, for 100 users per server, is sold separately); MicrosoftMail from Microsoft; and QuickMail from CE Software.andP;  A sixth major E-mailprogram, 3Com's 3+Mail, was not tested, because it is a fully integratedcomponent of a suite of network-management applications and is not sold as astand-alone E-mail product (see the &quot;3Com's 3+Mail&quot; sidebar).andM;Delivering the MailandM;When you set up a LAN (local-area network) in your office, you enablework-group activities such as sharing printers and modems; setting upmultiuser databases; and exchanging files, using servers and transferprograms.andP;  When you install an E-mail system, you increase your network'svalue by permitting a user to send messages and files directly to any otheruser.andM;Messaging and storage.andP;  There are two fundamental strategies for exchangingmessages and files between Macs on a network: point-to-point andstore-and-forward exchanges.andP;  In a point-to-point strategy, one node sends afile -- or message -- directly to another node.andP;  Store-and-forward systemsuse a central repository, usually a file or mail server, where all messagesand files are stored and sent on to their destinations as needed orrequested.andM;Point-to-point file transfer doesn't have centralized store-and-forward filesharing's one major advantage: the ability to retrieve stored files from thecentral server at a later time.andP;  This is important in cases where users arecontinuously logging on to and off of the network, because messages and filescan still be sent to them even when they are not on-line.andM;Simple file-transfer strategies -- both point-to-point and store-and-forward-- are considered &quot;blind,&quot; because recipients are not notified that a filehas been placed on their Macintosh's drive.andP;  This intelligence is now beingadded to both methods.andP;  Products such as Apple's Oscar and Beagle Bros' Flashhave added notification to point-to-point transfers.andP;  E-mail systems use asophisticated store-and-forward method of file exchange, which combines theintelligence of message notification with the capabilities of centralizedfile storage.andM;Most E-mail packages use a client/server model wherein individual users(clients) log in to a centralized mail server, where they're notified ofmessages and files and where they can pick up and deliver messages and filesfor other users.andP;  E-mail can also operate on a point-to-point basis, buthaving it do so sacrifices store-and-forward capabilities.andM;We tested all five products in a store-and-forward configuration.andP;  In eachcase, the message center was a Mac IIcx with 4 megabytes of RAM and a40-megabyte Jasmine harddisk drive (see the &quot;Testing, Testing, Testing ...&quot;andO;sidebar and Figures 1,2, and 3).andM;File server versus mail server.andP;  When we were testing the five programs'performance, the first major differences showed up in relation to theirserver configurations.andP;  Some E-mail packages, such as cc:Mail and DaynaMAIL,must be installed on top of a file server, such as AppleShare; other programsoperate by using their own mail-server software.andM;The file-server setup has the advantage of letting you pick your serverplatform more easily.andP;  File servers compatible with AFP (AppleTalk FilingProtocol, recommended for file servers on AppleTalk networks) are availablefor Mac, PC, and VAX systems.andP;  The disadvantages of a file-server-basedsystem center on performance: In order to preserve the server'sinteroperability among platforms, these E-mail systems sometimes require theclient to execute operations that in other programs would be performed by theserver.andP;  DaynaMAIL, for example, replicates a file when sending the samemessage to several people, whereas cc: Mail opens user-index files fromacross the network to notify the recipients that a message has been posted.andO;Either operation can tie up a user's Mac for considerable amounts of time aswell as increase network traffic.andM;DaynaMAIL and cc: Mail require a file server as a base.andP;  When testing thesetwo products, we first installed AppleShare on the Macintosh IIcx servers andon the clients' SEs.andP;  Only then could we install the server and clientsoftware for DaynaMAIL and cc: Mail.andP;  Both of these programs were generallyslower than the three mail-server-based systems.andP;  InBox, however, was slowerthan QuickMail and Microsoft Mail, since TOPS chose to make the InBox clientdo more work than QuickMail's or Microsoft Mail's clients do.andM;File copying versus databases.andP;  A crucial aspect of an E-mail program'sperformance is its structure, or the way messages and files are sent andstored in the E-mail server.andP;  Some E-mail programs send, copy, and storemessages and files as separate items in several folders -- one for eachclient.andP;  Others store messages and files as a single item inside a database(see the &quot;How It Works&quot; sidebar).andP;  In the first case, data insurance isbought at the cost of greater server activity and disk fragmentation.andP;  In thesecond, data efficiency is bought at the cost of putting all the eggs in onebasket.andM;Our tests show a direct correlation between client/server structure andperformance.andP;  Structure has a direct bearing on how users perceive an E-mailsystem's performance -- some packages, such as DaynaMAIL, InBox, and -- to acertain extent -- cc: Mail, make users wait while they deliver messagesaddressed to several users.andP;  Administrators, on the other hand, don't looktoo kindly on a package, such as QuickMail, that can overtax a server'shard-disk drive by rapidly filling it with messages and files.andM;Each structure does have its advantages, however, Mail programs thatreplicate files (DaynaMAIL, InBox, and QuickMail) ensure that all users senta message get their own copy.andP;  The programs that keep a single copy in adatabase (cc: Mail and Microsoft Mail) ensure efficiency by storing 1 copy ofa message -- rather than 5, 10, or 30 -- thus minimizing disk usage.andM;Setup and AdministrationandM;Setting up a fast and reliable E-mail system requires good planning.andP;  You canenhance performance by using a fast CPU with at least 2 megabytes of RAM anda fast hard-disk drive as the server.andP;  Also, use zoning strategies that don'tput too many devices in one zone or too many users on one E-mail server (see&quot;How to Set Up the Perfect Network&quot; June '90, page 142).andP;  Avoid having usersaccess servers over routers -- routers can degrade performance and make userslose connection with their mail center.andM;If you use AppleShare as your file server for DaynaMAIL or cc: Mail, considerwhether the file server should be active at the same time as the E-mailsystem.andP;  All the E-mail packages reviewed here are compatible withAppleShare, giving you the economical option of running both servers on thesame Mac.andP;  The more traffic there is on either of the servers, however, thepoorer the performance of both.andP;  To avoid this situation, many companiesrecommend that you dedicate a Mac to mail serving alone.andM;Setup and user lists.andP;  DaynaMAIL and cc: Mail are the least friendly to usewhen you're setting up the E-mail system and establishing user lists, in partbecause they reside on a file server.andP;  Users can't use the E-mail serviceunless the server volume is mounted and their names are registered on thefile server; they must also be registered with the E-mail server.andM;InBox, QuickMail, and Microsoft Mail are easier to set up.andP;  Their manualsprovide comprehensive information on setting up your network, and InBox andQuickMail provide detailed specifications on the RAM and disk space you'llneed, depending on use.andP;  Microsoft Mail is the most streamlined of the three,and its setup is the easiest.andM;The first administrative task to tackle when setting up a mail program isbuilding the user-name lists and assigning passwords.andP;  DaynaMAIL gets lowmarks here because you need to remember precisely how you entered users'names in the AppleShare list -- it doesn't recognize any spelling variations.andO;DaynaMAIL also confines you to the DOS eight-character naming convention,which means a long name can't be entered in full.andP;  InBox is more generous andalso allows you to configure the user-name list by first or last name or putit in a customized order.andM;The administrator needs to be able to maintain these lists easily, especiallyif the mail server is on an internet (where two or more networks are linkedvia a bridge or router).andP;  In such cases, propagating directories for variousservers so that users know whom they can send messages to can be difficult.andO;The key thing to know about any mail package is whether separate lists aremaintained for each server or a global directory is built and maintained atevery server.andM;DaynaMAIL and cc:MAIL maintain separate lists for each server, which have tobe manually updated one at a time when users change.andP;  cc:Mail lets you importand export lists from server to server to maintain current directories acrossinternets.andP;  PO Manager (from the River Bend Group in McLean, Virginia)automates this for you.andM;QuickMail maintains separate user lists for each server.andP;  Users can see otherlocal servers by accessing those zones and manually adding names from anotherzone's directory to their own.andP;  QuickMail also has a NameServer utility,which is installed on the mail server and maintains a database of allinternet E-mail recipients.andP;  You still have to manually export and importlists across servers to build global, enterprisewide directories, but theNameServer lets you do a certain amount of administrative work by allowingyou to keep your personal group lists current.andM;InBox Plus and Microsoft Mail provide automatic directory propagation acrossservers whenever a change in any server's name directory is registered.andO;Building a global list of names at each server has the advantage of keepinglist administration to a minimum and screening out the internet'scomplexities to users, who see one list of names and don't have to worrywhether the recipients of their mail are located in the next room, the nextbuilding, or even Hong Kong.andM;Server/client maintenance.andP;  Maintenance includes adding users to the system,adding new features as they become available, backing up the mail files, andoptimizing the server disk for better performance.andM;Optimizing the server disk deletes empty spaces between files and betweenparts of files that can slow down disk read time.andP;  This process becomes moreand more critical over time for products that replicate messages, such asDaynaMAIL, InBox, and QuickMail.andP;  Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail, which usesingle-instance storage systems, do not show nearly as much diskfragmentation.andM;DaynaMAIL, InBox, and QuickMail showed considerable server-disk fragmentationafter our tests.andP;  Fragmentation also occurs when files are deleted.andO;DaynaMAIL and QuickMail, however, reclaim some of this disk space by cleaningup user folders whenever a user logs off.andP;  Our tests showed this to be alengthy process with DaynaMAIL.andM;InBox Administrator has a utility for reclaiming disk space when the serveris not in use -- late at night, for instance -- since deleting messages fromthe server deletes only their directories and not the actual files.andM;Considering the importance of backing up and restoring for data security andperformance, it's surprising that none of the manuals spends much time on thesubject and that only Microsoft Mail provides a backup-and-restore utility.andM;User FeaturesandM;E-mail should be easy to use, with a minimal set of straightforward userfunctions and a clean user interface (see Table 1).andP;  It should makeaddressing and sending a message or enclosing a file simple, and there shouldbe keyboard equivalents for most mouse and menu operations.andM;All of the programs except cc:Mail use a DA for listing a user's mail, andall of them let you print a message, but there the similarities stop.andO;QuickMail has the greatest number and variety of user features, althoughsometimes at the cost of a cluttered interface (see Figure 4).andP;  At theopposite end of the feature spectrum is Microsoft Mail, which has astreamlined look that users take to easily (see Figure 5).andP;  In between arethe other three packages, which take their own approaches to user-interfacedesign (see Figure 6).andM;User preferences.andP;  These settings allow users to decide several details, suchas how often and by what method they are notified of incoming mail.andO;DaynaMAIL and cc:Mail provide the fewest options, QuickMail the most.andM;QuickMail lets you sort your mail by priority, subject, sender, and date(version 2.2 adds a reverse-sort feature).andP;  You can do most of this inDaynaMAIL and InBox too, with DaynaMAIL categorizing your messages as new orold mail for viewing.andP;  InBox has a search function that lets you screen outmail from your list.andM;Most of the products we looked at send you a receipt when your mail has beenread.andP;  But because it's easy to forget a memo when it's out of sight, thisfeature is of only limited use.andP;  QuickMail is the only product that has aUser Mail Log (there's an Administrator Mail Log in cc:Mail).andP;  QuickMail'slog tracks every piece of mail that a user has sent, whether it's Pending(for another server), Unread, or Read.andP;  You can also retrieve and &quot;unsend&quot;messages.andP;  This utility entails a certain amount of server overhead, however,because a file is maintained on the server until you delete it in the log.andM;Multiple addressees and groups.andP;  To select message recipients in InBox andDaynaMAIL, the user must manually scroll through a name list, which quicklybecomes tedious if the list is long.andP;  Users should be able to locate apotential addressee by typing the first couple of characters in the name andpressing Return.andP;  cc:Mail, QuickMail, and Microsoft Mail all let you addressyour mail from the keyboard, and you can designate a recipient as CC:(carboncopy) or BCC:(blind carbon copy, unseen by the other recipients).andP;  InQuickMail, you keep pressing Return to rotate recipient names through thesedesignations.andM;Sending messages to multiple recipients can be a chore.andP;  One way to avoidhaving to select each name is to create a group.andP;  If you typically send amessage to everyone in accounting, for instance, you can create anaccountants' group and then simply address your message with the group namewhen you want to send it to those recipients.andP;  You can include the names ofusers from other servers and zones to address messages easily across servers.andM;For greatest efficiency, setting up group address books from the generalnames listing should clearly be a user function, as it is in DaynaMAIL,InBox, and QuickMail.andP;  In cc:Mail and Microsoft Mail, it's the job of the theE-mail administrator.andM;Keeping group lists current can be a problem.andP;  Only QuickMail provides autility for verifying whether or not a group list is current.andP;  MicrosoftMail, which maintains a global directory, can't delete names from group listsas they're deleted from the global directory (although mail is not sent todeleted users).andM;Multiple enclosures.andP;  E-mail users often want to enclose more than one filewith a message -- copies of correspondence, for instance.andP;  InBox is limitedonly by available RAM in the number of documents you can enclose; QuickMailand cc: Mail permit 16 and 20 enclosures, respectively; and both DaynaMAILand Microsoft Mail currently limit users to one enclosure only, a limit manyfind unacceptable.andM;A new product, StuffIt Deluxe from Aladdin Systems, allows you to circumventthis problem, and Microsoft Mail will soon allow you to automatically stuffdocuments into an archive so that multiple messages can be sent at once.andO;StuffIt Deluxe is also compatible with QuickMail.andM;Storage.andP;  InBox, QuickMail, and cc: Mail let you set up a filing system onyour hard-disk drive for storing mail.andP;  DaynaMAIL and Microsoft Mail do not,although you can save messages as text files in folders on the Finder.andM;Using filing systems is the best way to save text files, because you canaccess your storage folders and messages from within your E-mail program.andO;Storing files on your local hard-disk drive helps clean out your mailbox onthe server, which in turn speeds up the loading of incoming mail and reducesthe server's storage load.andM;Advanced FeaturesandM;Forms.andP;  All the E-mail packages have a basic message form; InBox andDaynaMAIL also have forms for phone messages, and users of QuickMail andMicrosoft Mail can design any form they want.andP;  Microsoft Mail and cc: Mailalso let you display certain graphics -- Microsoft Mail has a special formfor this, and cc: Mail lets your Mac display Mac and PC graphics as enclosedfiles.andM;QuickMail and Microsoft Mail have optional forms that you can install in yourE-mail system.andP;  You can also create customized forms.andP;  Microsoft Mail uses aHyperCard-based forms generator, and the administrator installs custom formson the server.andP;  In contrast, QuickMail's QM Forms utility lets users installcustom forms at their own workstations.andM;Being able to create customized forms is not just a user perk -- when used inconjunction with databases and spreadsheets, this feature has great promisefor both data collection and distribution.andP;  Indeed, QuickMail provides anadd-on Data Collection bridge, and Microsoft Mail is developing a News CenterHyperCard form for downloading and distributing online news, which can beearmarked for users by category.andM;QuickMail and Microsoft Mail are not limited to just the written word -- bothhave a sound form that, when used with Farallon's MacRecorder or Farallon'snew MediaTracks, lets you send recorded voice messages over E-mail.andO;Microsoft Mail automatically installs Farallon's sound driver in therecipient's station if it's not already installed.andP;  Microsoft Mail'svoice-message system also uses an automatic data-compression algorithm -- akey feature, because sound files tend to be large.andP;  QuickMail will add thisfeature in subsequent releases.andM;Fax and E-mail.andP;  E-mail allows you to send messages directly from a Macthrough any fax modem hooked up to a network; cc:Mail, Microsoft Mail, andQuickMail all support this function.andM;Interapplication communication.andP;  QuickMail and Microsoft Mail have begun theprocess of integrating mail with other products.andP;  QuickMail lets you put aMail menu onto any application's menu bar, so that you can quickly encloseyour current active file within a memo.andP;  Microsoft, on the other hand, hastaken the road of integration at the API (application-programming interface)level and has integrated Mail with Word and Excel.andP;  If you are using eitherof these programs when you open your mail, you can fetch the enclosed fileand read it immediately from within Mail.andM;Real-time conferencing.andP;  QuickMail is currently the only mainstream Mac mailpackage that allows you to have a real-time conference with other networkusers, even across zones and local servers.andP;  In Conference mode, one usertalks (types) to another user without going through the server, and users cansave a log of their conversations.andP;  (This feature is similar to Flash fromBeagle Bros, which lets users chat back and forth, as well as transfer files,without using the server as an intermediary.)andM;Reaching OutandM;Extensibility.andP;  An E-mail system quickly becomes obsolete if it cannot beexpanded.andP;  Not only do you need to be able to add more users easily, but youalso need to be able to split your mail service among different servers,across zones, and even to remote locations.andM;Server-to-server communication.andP;  An internet consists of several linked LANs,which can be extended by routers and bridges.andP;  Server-to-server communicationrequires that one server knows when and where to deliver mail to otherservers, both locally (in the same building) and remotely (over phone ordedicated lines).andM;In order to have server-to-server communication in DaynaMAIL and cc:Mail, youneed a PC to do the linkup.andP;  DaynaMAIL also requires you to purchase MHS(Message Handling System) from Action Technologies, of Emeryville,California, for server-to-server communication.andP;  cc:Mail currently makes youbuy both its DOS version to do setup and administration and its cc:Mailgateway for server-to-server linkup.andM;InBox Plus, Microsoft Mail, and QuickMail are able to establish multipleservers, although you have to purchase additional server software becauseeach server is serialized on the network.andM;The QuickMail administrative software provides the most-elaborate options fortweaking local or remote server-to-server connections, including the abilityto adjust the length of the intervals between server-to-server fileforwarding, the transmission rates for modem dial-up, or the log-on times formaking connections to commercial services.andP;  Subsets of these features areavailable in other packages as well.andM;Multiplatform clients and servers.andP;  All the E-mail packages (exceptDaynaMAIL) currently provide support for Mac as well as PC clients on thesame network.andP;  On the other hand, because DaynaMAIL and cc:Mail run on top ofany AppleTalk-compatible file server, any platform that can be hooked up to aLocalTalk network and is compatible with products such as DaynaNET,AppleShare, TOPS, or NetWare can be used as a server.andP;  Microsoft Mail now hasVAX servers available from both Alisa and Pacer.andM;Remote access.andP;  Only QuickMail has a specific program for sending andreceiving messages from a remote location.andP;  It's possible, however, to sendand receive messages from a remote server with any E-mail program by using astandard telecommunications program for terminal emulation and at least a2,400-bps modem.andP;  This communication method can be time-consuming, though.andM;QuickMail's Quick Remote telecommunications package lets you dial directlyinto your E-mail system and pick up and deliver your mail, but it's slow anddoesn't provide you with many of the capabilities you get with your in-houseDA.andM;Gateways.andP;  LAN-based E-mail can connect to commercial mail systems, such asMCI and CompuServe, and corporate mail systems, such as PROFS (which,incidentally, includes the infamous Undelete feature that contributed toColonel Oliver North's embarrassment).andP;  There are two ways to make suchconnections: using a terminal emulator that allows client access to theremote server, or using a gateway that allows your local LAN mail server tospeak directly to the remote mail server (see Table 2).andM;Emulators are easier to write than true gateways -- writing to them is likeconfiguring a telecom package's log-on sequence.andP;  Gateways, which requiretime-consuming programming at the API level, are available from severaldevelopers.andM;The two approaches are very different.andP;  Every terminal emulation requiresthat a separate account be maintained at the mail server.andP;  If many users havetheir own MCI accounts, for instance, and they all try to send mail at thesame time, multiple connections are made with MCI simultaneously and thelocal server can quickly be brought to its knees.andM;A gateway, on the other hand, allows numerous clients to access a serverthrough a single channel.andP;  QuickMail leads the pack in the number ofemulators it provides, but gateways for all the E-mail packages areavailable, with more appearing all the time.andM;Future DirectionsandM;Now that E-mail on the Mac has achieved reasonable performance andreliability, vendors are beginning to tackle other issues such asmultiplatform communication, links to other mail systems, and theimplementation of X.400 WAN standards.andP;  We can expect E-mail to expand soonfrom messaging into such areas as automatic document transport, archivalsystems, and automated invoicing and data collection.andM;E-mail will soon be more than just simple text messaging, offering a richarray of electronic objects such as voice, images, and text in complexmultimedia documents.andP;  With faster networks, the transporting of such complexobjects will become commonplace.andP;  But these advancements are still in thefuture.andP;  To find out what the best E-mail choice is today, see &quot;The BottomLine,&quot; where you'll find MacUser NetWorkShop's picks and pans.andM;Testing, Testing, Testing ...andM;When we began this comprehensive review of E-mail systems, we had two choicesconcerning how to proceed.andP;  We could send all of MacUser's editors, writers,designers, and sales staff on vacation and use the magazine's 100-Mac networkfor a month's testing.andP;  Or we could set up camp in the MacUser NetWorkShopand thrash our test network until an E-mail winner emerged.andP;  We chose thelatter course.andM;MacUser NetWorkShop first installed each E-mail system as recommended by themanufacturer.andP;  We then created a variety of automated procedures to test eachsystem under three simulated workloads: (1) a &quot;normal&quot; load, defined as 30users per server, each sending four messages per hour, including one messagewith an enclosed 20-kilobyte file; (2) an added AppleShare overhead, createdby transferring a 10-megabyte folder to the mail server during messageactivity; and (3) a busy background network condition, created by one usercontinuously sending a message with an enclosed 20-kilobyte file to 30 users.andM;We ran these tests 11 times.andP;  Each test examined a different aspect of E-mailperformance.andP;  Since network variables can affect message-transfer speed, werepeated each test 6 times to ensure that we discovered each system's fullperformance range.andP;  We repeated some tests over two routers to simulateinternet transfers.andM;We've boiled the results down to three sets that best tell the story:single-message (Figure 1), enclosed-file (Figure 2), and multiple-messageperformance (Figure 3).andP;  The complete set of test results, including precisetimings for each iteration, will soon be available on MacUser's new on-lineservice, Zmac (see &quot;On the Line with MacUser&quot; in this issue).andM;The Bottom LineandM;Soon after we began testing the five most prominent E-mail systems, it becameclear that this was a two-horse race.andP;  A month of simulated office chatterconfirmed our suspicions: When picking an E-mail system, look first at CESoftware's QuickMail 2.2.2 and Microsoft Mail 2.0.andM;QuickMail is a fast, powerful, and full-featured E-mail package with loads offeatures for both user and administrator.andP;  CE Software seems to haveanticipated every E-mail need -- or whim.andP;  QuickMail isn't perfect, however.andO;It would earn at least another half mouse if it fixed its inefficientmultiple-message strategy.andP;  It's not unusual for a user to get a &quot;serverbusy&quot; message while QuickMail is grinding away, replicating messages andenclosures on the server.andP;  Larger networks can get into problems if theydon't allocate a large enough hard-disk drive, and weekly backup and restore(for hard-disk defragmentation) is a must.andM;Close behind QuickMail -- very, very close -- is Microsoft Mail 2.0.andP;  Mail islean and mean -- although maybe a bit too lean.andP;  Its client/serverrelationship is fast and efficient, and if the package were morefull-featured, it would clearly be the winner.andP;  If you can put up with alimited set of features for the time being, you may ultimately win out asMicrosoft adds to Mail's power.andP;  Mail 2.0 is spartan today, but it may be thenear-future choice for companies gearing up for large E-mail systems --especially those that benefit from Mail's integration with Microsoft Word andExcel.andM;For TOPS buyers, the basic InBox package is a can't-be-beat bargain: It'sfree.andP;  Users who like the program can upgrade to Sun Microsystems InBox Plus3.0 for a marginal cost, and they'll find it to be a good, solid product withmore user goodies than Microsoft Mail.andP;  InBox's client/server design coulduse some rethinking, however.andM;We can't recommend cc:Mail 1.1 and DaynaMAIL 1.01 in their currentincarnations.andP;  Although cc:Mail has earned a solid reputation in the PCworld, its lack of a Mac-based administrator package makes it not ready forprime Mac time.andP;  We'd also like to see more-competitive pricing: There aretoo many hidden costs for Mac-centric LANs.andP;  PC networks that are alreadyrunning cc:Mail, however, and want to add Macs to their network will findcc:Mail for Macintosh to be a reliable partner.andM;Finally, DaynaMAIL's designers need to go back to the drawing board.andO;DaynaMAIL is touchy to set up, slow to use, and still shaking out the bugs.andO;We advise users who are attracted to DaynaMAIL's distributed, serverlessoption to investigate a low-cost alternative such as Flash.andP;  For a lot lessmoney ($100 for unlimited users) and hassle you can have point-to-point filetransfer and simple messaging.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
