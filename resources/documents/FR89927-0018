FRA proposed to amend its operating practices regulationsto require that certain procedures be employed when railroad employeesoccupy camp cars. These actions are taken in response to a statutory mandate,Section 19(c) of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (RSIA) (Pub. L.100-342).In response to the NPRM, FRA received comments addressing various portionsof the proposed rule from the Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employes(BMWE) and the Association of American Railroads (AAR), and Amtrak. TheBMWE and the AAR submitted a joint proposal that has been helpful in theformulation of this rule. Both these parties also filed separate comments.Interested parties took little exception to the proposed rule. The issuewhich prompted the most discussion concerned the imposition of a speedlimit on trains passing occupied camp cars and a twenty-five foot envelopearound occupied camp cars.On April 5, 1989, the FRA held a public hearing in Washington, DC. Thecomments made at this hearing and those received in response to the publicationof the proposed rule are discussed in the Section-by-Section Analysis longwith some minor changes in the proposed rule.BackgroundAt present, railroads own 3,637 on-track vehicles that are typically usedto provide housing for workers who are building or maintaining tracks,signals, or bridges. These vehicles are known by several names, <T3>e.g.,</T3> camp cars, outfit cars, and bunk cars. For convenience,these vehicles are referred to as ``camp cars.'' The units range from modularhomes mounted on flat cars to converted passenger and freight cars. Thereare approximately 1,309 flat cars, 422 converted passenger cars, and 1,869converted freight cars. Nearly all are used by six Class I railroads: Atchison,Topeka and Santa Fe, Burlington Northern, Conrail, CSX Transportation Systems,Norfolk and Western, and Union Pacific.Under current industry practice, sizeable groups of workers are organizedin so-called ``production gangs'' to improve the speed, quality, and efficiencywith which large scale maintenance can be accomplished. Such a group willmove progressively over that section of rail lines on which work is beingdone. This is typically seasonal work that must be accomplished while weatherpermits. Railroads need to house workers in reasonable proximity to thework site; in many areas of the country, no feasible alternatives exist.Railroads assemble groups of workers and mechanized (on-rail) equipmentand assign a certain number of cars outfitted as mobile living quarters.That collective unit will station itself at a given site and perform itswork. At the end of the work day, crews return to the site of the sleepingquarters.Camp cars are generally parked in yards. When space allows, they are placedon tracks to which they have exclusive access. However, in many cases campcars must be located on tracks where switching is performed or to whichother carrier equipment requires access.When camp cars share a track or siding with other equipment, there is therisk that the cars will be struck by rolling stock and that the occupantswill be injured. A number of railroads have rules addressing this hazard.Current FRA regulations governing railroad operating practices, 49 CFRpart 218, prescribe rules for protection of railroad employees assignedto inspect, test, and repair rolling stock. This rule will extend similarprotection to workers occupying camp cars.Section 19(c) of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (RSIA) (Pub. L.100-342) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary shall, within one year after the date of the enactmentof this Act, amend part 218 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, toapply blue signal protection to on-track vehicles where rest is provided.</ITAG>The purpose of this provision is to require that the same type of protectionnow provided to workers on rolling stock be provided to all railroad employees.However, FRA's proposal does differ in some respects from both the existingregulatory formulation and from other existing methods for protecting railworkers because of the particular safety concerns that are present in thissituation.In formulating its proposal, FRA examined three distinct but related effortsto address the safety problems that are the focus of the legislative concern:(1) The historical industry approach to analogous safety concerns, nowembodied in FRA's blue signal provisions in part 218; (2) the current individualrailroad practices for worker protection; and (3) a joint recommendationsubmitted by a labor-management task force. FRA's final rule blends elementsfrom each of these sources. As noted in the NPRM, the BMWE/AAR submitted some suggestions on additionalissues of camp car safety. One, a prohibition against humping occupiedcamp cars or flat switching them without being coupled to a locomotive,was so important that it is included in this rule. Another suggestion wasto create a 25-foot ``envelope'' around camp cars to protect them frommovements on adjacent tracks, at least movements in excess of a designatedspeed.The issue of a speed restriction on trains passing within 25 feet of occupiedcamp cars generated more comment than any other matter. The BMWE recommendeda limitation of 40 m.p.h. on passing trains. The AAR, although opposedto a speed restriction, indicated that it would support a limit fo 55 m.p.h.on freight trains because of the importance which the BMWE attached tothis issue; the AAR opposed any limit on passenger trains. Amtrak opposedany speed restrictions on passing freight or passenger trains because ofthe disruption it anticipated in passenger train schedules and crew assignments.While there is an obvious correlation in railroad accidents between trainspeed and the extent on property damage, information supplied by the BMWEdid not show a causal relationship between train speed and accidents involvingcamp cars. Because imposition of a speed restriction on passing trainswould exceed the statutory mandate and because FRA has received no datato justify such a measure, no speed restriction will be imposed at thistime.FRA's basic safety purpose in this rule is to protect rail workers whenthey are occupying camp cars that have been parked on main track or otherthan main track. In such circumstances, the occupants of that equipmenthave a reasonable expectation that the equipment will not be moved withoutnotice. If the equipment is unexpectedly moved, the workers risk beinginjured or killed. In one such instance, a freight train collided withseveral camp cars resulting in injuries to twenty-two people, includingthe four crew members of the locomotive and 18 maintenance-of-way employees.The cause was a failure to close a switch on the main track.Since the camp cars themselves are not capable of self-propulsion, movementof these cars results either from the use of a locomotive or from the impactof other cars entering the track occupied by the camp cars. It is the riskposed by unanticipated movement of this nature that FRA is addressing inthis rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Current Practices</ITAG>Rail workers whose duties cause them to be on, under, or between rollingequipment for purposes such as inspecting, testing, or repairing that equipmenthave historically been afforded a method of protection that is commonlyknown as ``blue flag'' protection. The essential elements of this methodof protecting workers are placing a warning signal near the ends of theequipment being worked on and physically limiting access to the segmentof track on which such equipment is located. FRA has established clearminimums concerning each basic element of that method in subpart B of part218.Rail workers who occupy camp cars have historically been afforded varyingmethods of protection. This diversity is reflected in the current individualrailroad practices that FRA examined in preparing this proposal. When specificsystem-wide methods for protecting such workers have been in effect, mostrailroads employed both a warning signal and some form of physical accessdeterrent.Building on that historical precedent, the BMWE/AAR recommended use ofboth a warning signal and physical impediments to prevent the unanticipatedmovement of occupied camp cars.<ITAG tagnum="84">FRA's Final Rule</ITAG>Where railroads currently provide blue signal protection to camp cars,most use a white signal with black lettering warning of the camp cars'presence. We are aware, however, of at least one railroad that uses a bluetinted signal. In selecting the design of the warning signal, we consideredthe option of requiring one type of sign, while permitting the alternativecoloration if the signal was otherwise deployed in accordance with theregulation. We were concerned, however, that permitting various railroadsto use different colored signals for camp car protection would create asafety hazard, especially where a train crew operates over another railroad'sterritory. We note that adoption of a uniform tint could create at leasta short-term risk on railroads required to shift to that coloration. Butthe designated signal mandated in this rule is premised on the belief thatthere is less danger in requiring one, or a small number, of railroadsto experience a short-term adjustment than there is in allowing a systemdiffering color codes to exist over the long-term.The blue tint is recognized throughout the industry as a warning that movementbeyond the signal will create a hazard of death or injury to workers onor about equipment on that track, and as a requirement to obtain the permissionof those workers prior to any such movement. However, signals colored blueare normally employed for only relatively brief periods (hours rather thandays) and only to denote a particular class of hazards (<T3>i.e., </T3>that workers are on, under, or between rolling equipmenton that track). Uniform color coding of hazard signals is a long traditionin the railroad industry. Orange identifies a rear-end marker; yellow isused by many carriers for derails, and red represents a ``stop signal.''The color blue has long been associated with a particular risk_workerson, under, or between rolling equipment on an occupied track_and we areconcerned that its use for long periods in relation to a different classof hazards could promote confusion counterproductive to the safety objectivesof this proposal. We are also concerned that using the color blue to denotediffering hazards could undermine the employees' confidence in the reliabilityof color coding for other hazards. Finally, our data indicate that morerailroads use a white lettered disk to identify camp cars than a blue tintedwarning, meaning that the adoption of a white disk will require less adjustmentthan endorsement of the color blue.One final concern about the signal is the need to illuminate the device.Given the fact that workers tend to occupy camp cars during darkness andthat such equipment contains a ready source of electrical power, FRA hasmandated that the signal be illuminated during darkness.The placement of a warning signal alone does not provide a sufficient levelof protection for workers in camp cars. Any number of circumstances canrender that signal ineffective. Oversight, inattention, inadvertent removal,and vandalism are some of the more common illustrations of what can nullifythe effectiveness of such devices. FRA, therefore, is requiring that thesignal display be supplemented with another method for physically limitingaccess to the track on which the camp cars are parked.Any track on which camp cars are parked will be connected on at least oneend to some other track. FRA proposes to physically restrict movement onthe segment of track on which the camp cars are located by controllingsuch connections that could provide other cars or locomotives access tothe camp cars. Access to track on which camp cars are located would berestricted either by installation of a locked derail or by lining, lockingand spiking the connecting switches away from the segment of track wherethe occupied cars are placed. Physical restriction of access to the campcars would occur either through placement of a locked derail at a specifieddistance from the end of the camp cars or by having the connecting switchesspiked, lined away from the segment of track occupied by the camp cars,and locked in that position. The derails or switches would have to be lockedwith an effective locking device. FRA has previously defined such lockingdevices as excluding locks that multiple parties can operate, such as thetypical switch lock, and requiring a special lock that is controlled onlyby the workers who are being protected by it. <T3>See </T3>49 CFR 218.5(d). FRA previously discussed the meaning of thisprovision when it adopted the current rules (44 FR 2175, January 10, 1979).In essence, FRA proposes to employ the same procedures for limiting accessthat are contained in its existing rules but with one important difference.The procedures for physically limiting access to the segment of track occupiedby camp cars will be applied regardless of whether the cars are parkedon main track or other than main track.FRA will deviate from its existing regulatory approach to address the factthat camp cars, unlike employees assigned to work on, under, or betweenrolling equipment, tend to remain in a single location for lengthly periodsof time. FRA will follow the practice of several railroads and requirethat the dispatcher be notified of camp car placement. The final rule allowsthe dispatcher flexibility in alerting operating personnel about the presenceof the camp cars rather than dictate the manner in which that informationwill be disseminated. At present, one railroad issues train orders indicatingthe location of cars and the others use a combination of measures to notifyaffected personnel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-By-Section Analysis</ITAG>FRA is adding a new subpart E to part 218 that includes the provisionsrelating to camp cars. FRA recently initiated another rulemaking to prohibittampering with locomotive safety devices that will become subpart D ofthis regulation (see the August 31, 1988 issue of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>53 FR 33786). FRA also is adding a new definitionto existing andSection; 218.5 to define the type of rolling equipment towhich this subpart applies.Two parties took exception to the definition of ``camp car'' as it appearedin the NPRM. They stated that the definition was over-inclusive as it includedtrack geometry cars, business cars, research cars, Amtrak dormitory, carsand others. BMWE stated that the legislation was specifically targetedat providing protection for maintenance-of-way employees. AAR objectedto the fact that the rule required the use of these protective proceduresfor cars other than camp cars, namely those listed above. The statute requiresthat protection be provided to ``on-track vehicles where rest is provided.''It does not exempt any cars when they are parked on the track. The onlyexception to the rule is wreck trains, because occupied cars in wreck trainsare not left parked on the track, and wreck trains are under the exclusivecontrol of the people working on them; they are not subject to movementby other crews. All other cars must receive protection when they are parkedon a track. The rule does not apply when cars are in a train.Section 218.71 states the scope of the subpart. The final rule stipulatesthat protection be provided to all on-track vehicles that house railroademployees. The BMWE/AAR objected to the scope of the proposed rule. TheNPRM, in keeping with the statutory mandate, required that protection beprovided to all employees housed in camp cars. The BMWE/AAR contended thatthe rule was intended to apply only to maintenance-of-way employees. FRAhas determined that all railroad employees are entitled to this type ofprotection. Other crafts are occasionally housed in camp cars, and FRAdeclines to make craft distinctions in its regulations, especially wherethe safety of employees is at stake.Section 218.73 requires that a signal be displayed whenever such cars aredesignated for occupancy, not only when crews would normally be restingor off-duty (such cars are also used to provide meals for crews or to housesick or injured workers). Once such signals have been displayed, camp carscould not be coupled to other rolling equipment or moved. As noted earlier,FRA has determined that this signal must be a white disk with the words``Occupied Camp Car'' in black lettering. This section also indicates thosepersons authorized to display or remove such signals.Comments were received on three elements of this section: nighttime illuminationof the warning signals, the language regarding coupling of occupied campcars, and the placement and removal of the warning signals.Amtrak stated that since camp cars are often stored for long periods oftime, there would be occasions when the illuminated white light would notfunction. They recommended that a highly reflectorized material be incorporatedinto the mounting of the light and that the sign be reflectorized. Underthe final rule, railroads must provide an illuminated warning signal atnight; a reflectorized mounting may be used to supplement the illuminationprovided by a white light, but it cannot substitute for this requirement.With respect to the coupling of occupied cars, the BMWE/AAR comented thata literal reading of the language in the proposed rule would mean thatcamp cars could not be coupled to generator cars, dining cars, water cars,etc., while warning signals were displayed. The intent to the rule is toprevent movement of occupied cars while the warning signals are in place.The rule does not preclude coupling of such cars before protection hasbeen established. Neither does the rule preclude movement of such carssubsequently if signals are removed by designated persons in accordancewith specified procedures. An authorized person who removes protectivesignals must ensure that the occupants are made aware that the cars areto be moved. The language of andSection; 218.73(a)(1) has been amended toindicate that camp cars may be coupled to other equipment before warningsignals are erected:After signals have been displayed_(1) The camp cars may not be moved for coupling to other rolling equipment.The third comment on this section concerned necessary movements of occupiedcars once the warning signals have been put in place. The NPRM providedthat the placement and removal of warning signals indicating occupied campcars may be performed only by those persons authorized under the rule.AAR interpreted the proposed rule to mean that when occupants had leftcamp cars for an assignment, the signals could be moved and the cars couldbe switched. It is permissible to do this. However, the signals may onlybe removed by designated persons as identified in this section. Any partyseeking to move rolling equipment onto track where occupied cars are parked,must contact one of the parties designated in andSection; 218.73(b) and arrangefor that person to remove the warning signals. FRA recognizes the needthat can arise, in the course of railroad operations, to have access totrack on which occupied cars may be parked. At the same time, FRA mustensure that such movement does not pose any risk of injury to camp caroccupants.Section 218.75 requires that each switch providing access to the segmentof track where camp cars are located be lined and secured with an effectivelocking device and tagged with an appropriate signal. This requirementapplies regardless of whether camp cars are located on main track or otherthan main track. FRA will employ the same definitions for the terms ``switchproviding access,'' ``main track,'' and ``effective locking device'' thatit currently employs for the blue signal protection provisions of part218. This section also contains FRA's requirement to provide notificationthat camp cars are occupying a segment of track.The BMWE/AAR proposal endorsed the practice of spiking the switch. Thispractice is currently followed by several of the railroads that use campcars. The proposed rule did not require the spiking of manually operatedswitches. Spiking, however, is a useful measure because it requires a deliberateeffort to reverse its effects and ensures that the protection affordedemployees will not be circumvented by simple negligence. Therefore, therequirement that switches be spiked has been included in the final rule.FRA recognizes that spiking is not practicable when ties are concrete.In such instances the use of clamps which secure the switch point and stockrail together would be acceptable.Section 218.77 contains the details of establishing protection in areaswhere remotely controlled switches are present. The designated person,normally the camp car foreman, must notify the operator of the switchesthat camp cars have been placed in the area. The operator of each remotelycontrolled switch must inform the designated camp car employee that eachswitch has been lined against movement to that track and locked. The operatorof each remotely controlled switch shall maintain for 15 days a writtenrecord of each notification with the requisite information. This requirementvaries from FRA's approach to remotely controlled switches under the currentblue signal rule in two ways. First, although the retention period forthis written record remains the same, that period does not commence untilthe operator has been notified that protection is no longer needed. Second,FRA will modify slightly its methods of physical protection when the accessswitch is a remotely controlled switch. As noted earlier, FRA's currentblue signal rule implicitly contemplated only relatively brief time periodswhen the use of a remotely controlled switch would be restrained. Sincethe locking devices for such switches do not have the same level of physicalsecurity as the locks required for manual switches, FRA is concerned that,with the passage of an extended period of time, such a remotely controlledswitch could be inadvertently activated. FRA addresses this possible occurrenceby requiring that a locked derail be installed at least 150 feet from theend of the camp cars.The proposed rule would have required imposition of a locked derail onlywhen occupied cars were to remain on tracks for more than 48 hours. Inthe final rule, FRA has eliminated this 48-hour window for the followingreasons: It is rare that camp cars are on a track for less than 48 hours;there is no safety justification for this grace period; for enforcementpurposes, it would be difficult to determine when the 48-hour period began.Most important, remotely controlled switches do not provide the same levelof protection as manually locked switches.Section 218.79 provides alternative methods of protection for occupiedcamp cars covered under section 218.77. When railroad operations demandthat a portion of the track be used by other equipment, FRA will sanctionthe use of derails to subdivide the track in question, just as the currentblue signal rules permit in servicing areas. Camp cars located on trackswhere switching occurs or where other rolling equipment has access canbe protected by use of a portable derail placed 150 feet from the end ofthe camp car and by use of the required signal. If speed within the areais restricted to not more than five miles per hour, a derail, capable ofrestricting access to that portion of the track where the occupied campcars are located, will satisfy the requirements of a manually operatedswitch when placed at least 50 feet from the end of the equipment to beprotected by the appropriate signal. When derails are so used, they mustbe locked with an effective locking device and flagged with an appropriatesignal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Pursuant To E.O. 12291 and DOT Policies </ITAG>The rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing policies and procedures.It is considered to be a non-major rulemaking under Executive Order 12291,but significant under DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February26, 1979). At present, railroads own an estimated 3,637 camp car-type vehicles. Ofthis total, approximately 90 percent are owned by the following carriers,ordered by size of fleet: Burlington Northern (901), CSX (730), Conrail(539), Union Pacific (486), Norfolk and Western (362), and Santa Fe (327).These six railroads comprise the majority of the activity as well as ownershipof camp cars. The remaining 10 percent of camp cars are owned by 16 railroads,with none of these owning more than 70 camp cars, or 2 percent of the totalcamp car fleet.The majority of camp cars are currently afforded sufficient protection.The rule will further reduce the accident risk by mandating more uniformsafety procedures for protecting workers housed in camp cars.Projected potential benefits of the rule are based on avoidance of accidents.Historical data from FRA shows one major accident in the last ten years.Track and property damage from the accident mounted to $36,550 and 22 injuries(4 crew members and 18 maintenance-of-way employees). Each injured employeewas estimated to be absent from work an average of almost 17 days.The projected potential costs from the rule are expected to be minimal.Cost impacts will be limited to purchases of additional equipment thatmay be needed by railroads not already complying with the planned regulatoryaction. FRA estimates that manufacture and illumination of the proposedsignal device will cost $94.95 per commercial device and approximately$20.00 per railroad-made device. The 760 estimated devices include allcases and may well overstate the actual cost of the proposal. Nevertheless,the total cost of this estimate does not exceed $34,178, assuming thata third of the devices are manufactured commercially and the remainingtwo thirds are produced by the railroads. There will be minimal costs resultingfrom the recordkeeping provisions. This rule will not have a significanteconomic impact since the basic protection mandated in the Rail SafetyImprovement Act of 1988 is already practiced by most railroads using campcars.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>These regulations will not have any economic impact on small entities.FRA therefore certifies that this proposal will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The rule has information collection requirements. FRA is submitting theseinformation collection requirements to the Office of Management and Budgetfor approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Any comments onthese information collection requirements should be provided to Mr. GaryWaxman, Regulatory Policy Branch, Office of Management and Budget, NewExecutive Office Building, 726 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503.Copies of any such comments should also be submitted to the docket of thisrulemaking at the address provided above. When the Office of Managementand Budget approves the information collection requirements in andSection;218.77, the FRA will publish a document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>adding the OMB control number.Environmental ImpactThe rule will not have any identifiable environmental impact.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>This rule will not have a substantial effect on the states, on the relationshipbetween the states and the national government, or on the distributionof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
