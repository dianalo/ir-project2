Acting for the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois asked a federal court here to issue an injunction to prevent the large health-care company from selling the solutions. The U.S. attorney said the action was taken because procedures used to make the products haven't been approved by the FDA.    At issue are solutions made at the company's Morton Grove, Ill., and Bridgeport, N.J., regional-compounding centers. At these centers, Baxter takes FDA-approved drug products it purchases from pharmaceutical houses in the form of liquid concentrates or powders, mixes them in solution, freezes them and then sells them to hospitals and other customers.    A Baxter spokesman said the company has been repackaging drugs at the centers since 1982 with the FDA's knowledge. But in late 1986, the FDA contended that Baxter's repackaging operation needed regulatory approval, a position the company disagrees with.    The Baxter spokesman said an injunction would affect a small part of two Baxter businesses, its intravenous-solutions unit and its operation that provides products to non-hospital health-care facilities.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Baxter closed at $22.25 a share, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
