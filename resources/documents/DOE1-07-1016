The maximum concentration (solubility,S/sub Pu/) of Pu(IV) in the equilibrium organic phase at which stillno third phase is formed is measured as a function of the nitric acidconcentration in the equilibrium aqueous phase C/sub H/, the temperature,and the molecular size of n-alkane duluent. Results show that maximaof S/sub Pu/ at 6 to 7 M nitric acid are observed at 17 deg C, 26 degC and 35 deg C while not at 40 deg C. Minima on the S/sub Pu/ vs. C/subH/ curves at 0.5 to 2 M mitric acid have been observed at 17 deg C and26 deg C. It is found that the molecular size of n-alkane diluents hasa very pronounced effect on S/sub Pu/. The effect of aqueous equilibriumPu(IV) concentration on the formation of a third phase is investigated,when the equilibrium HNO/sub 3/ concentration is 3.5 M. It is shown thatthe plutonium concentration of the third phase is increased with increasingaqueous equilibrium Pu(IV) concentration. The effect of the additionof lauryl alcohol on the S/sub Pu/ is preliminarily studied.</TEXT></DOC>
