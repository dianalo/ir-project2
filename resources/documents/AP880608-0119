Paul Simon, saying ``the verdict is in,''today formally pulled the curtain on his quest for the Democraticpresidential nomination and endorsed Michael Dukakis.   The Illinois senator said he would urge his 150 or so Democraticdelegates to join him in backing the Massachusetts governor unlessthey have strong leanings toward another candidate from Illinois,Jesse Jackson.   Simon suspended his faltering campaign two months ago, saying heanticipated a brokered convention in Atlanta. That nevermaterialized.   ``Conventional wisdom has conventionally been wrong on justabout everything,'' he said at a news conference at DemocraticNational Committee Headquarters.   ``The primaries and caucuses are now history. The verdict is in.I will vote for Michael Dukakis at the convention and will doeverything I can to advance his candidacy after the convention,''he said.   The Illinois senator had amassed about 180 delegates, primarilyon the strength of his home-state win in the March 15 Illinoisprimary. But about 30 had defected in recent weeks, most to Dukakis.   His failure to drop out of the race earlier angered some Jacksonsupporters. In a bow to them, Simon said, ``I will urge delegateswho have no strong commitment in any other direction to vote forMichael Dukakis.''   He said Dukakis must make clear ``that he has a positive programof jobs, for quality education, for long-term care, for moving awayfrom the arms race, for things our party traditionally has stoodfor.''   The bow-tied, liberal Simon, whose hopes were buoyed by hissecond-place finish behind Richard Gephardt in Iowa's openingcaucuses last February, said Dukakis ``clearly is more sensitive tothe fundamental needs of our nation'' than Republican George Bush.   ``I am releasing my delegates, though I expect to work with themon the platform and other matters that may come before theconvention,'' he said.   He praised Jackson, who he said ``has contributed immensely toour party by making us more sensitive to the needs of the lessfortunate.''   But he said Democratic voters had clearly chosen Dukakis, ``whothrough the course of this campaign has demonstrated his leadershipskills, his substance and his commitment to progress for allAmericans.''   Dukakis, who sewed up the nomination by sweeping Tuesday's finalprimaries in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico, wasalso headed to Missouri today to pick up the endorsement of anothererstwhile rival, Rep. Richard Gephardt.   In February, he came out of the gate finishing a close second inthe Iowa caucuses behind Gephardt, and third in New Hampshire'sprimary behind Dukakis and Gephardt.   But with the exception of his home-state win, it was mostlydownhill from there as Simon went down in the polls and deeper intodebt. He sat out the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries across theSouth, then fared poorly in contests in Michigan, Wisconsin andelsewhere.   He said in April that he wanted to hang onto his delegates tohave some influence over whom the party nominated.   But in recent weeks, more than 30 of Simon's 180 delegatesdefected, most to Dukakis.   Simon, 59, a freshman senator whose term expires in 1990, ran asan unabashed liberal Democrat. ``I'm not a neo-anything,'' heboasted.   He promised to curb the arms race and to provide long-termhealth care for the elderly, public works jobs for the unemployedand major new education initiatives.   He encountered skepticism about how he would comply with anotherpromise: balancing the budget in three years.   Suspending his campaign two months ago instead of ending itallowed Simon to retain 47 at-large Illinois delegates whootherwise would have gone to Jesse Jackson, the runner-up in theIllinois primary. That rankled Jackson supporters.   Simon has expressed little interest in the No. 2 spot on theDemocratic ticket, saying last Friday, ``I'm frankly not interestedin spending four years cutting ribbons and attending statefunerals.''   And he made clear on April 7 that his first fling at thepresidency was also his last.   ``Running for president is a little like taking an ice-coldshower,'' he said then. ``It's a great one-time experience, but Ihave no yearning for a repeat performance.''</TEXT></DOC>
