Many members of the Sejm, Parliament's lower chamber,cited a hyperinflation threat from Warsaw's move to allowgreater government spending and a gradual expansion of themoney supply to encourage investment and exports.   Separately, Parliament confirmed Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz'sappointment as central bank president, ending a conflict withPresident Lech Walesa. Ms. Gronkiewicz-Waltz, 40 years old,is a public and bank law specialist. Mr. Walesa proposed herfor the job in November, but the lawmakers in Decemberrejected her nomination, saying she lacked managerialexperience.   The previous bank chief was arrested in September oncharges of fiscal neglect in a trading company scandalinvolving state banks' funds.                                                                                                          CHINA, RUSSIA SIGN TRADE PACT                                                                                                          China and Russia signed their first economic and tradeagreement since the Soviet Union collapsed. Beijing gave fewdetails but said it hoped to establish cooperativeenterprises in Russia. Separately, the World Bank and UnitedNations Development Program agreed to give China $3.7 millionfor two environmental-protection projects. One is for China,the world's largest coal user, to study ways to reduceemissions of carbon dioxide and other gases. The other is todevelop a strategy for protecting endangered species, such asthe giant panda, Manchurian tiger and snow leopard.                                                                                                          BRITAIN ISSUES HARASSMENT CODE                                                                                                          Britain, in a campaign to combat sexual harassment, sent acode of conduct to 100,000 companies with more than 10employees. The government said harassment at work not onlyhurts people but is bad for business, damaging morale andefficiency. The 12-page leaflet lists offensive actions,advises how to seek help and warns firms of legal trouble ifthey don't discipline offenders. The government received 427sexual-harassment complaints last year, up 50% from 1990.                                                                                                          ARGENTINA WINS GATT PRAISE                                                                                                          Argentina's reform program was lauded for its promise ofcreating one of the world's most open economies. The GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, the main world trade group,praised Buenos Aires for transforming the cosseted economy.Inflation is at a 20-year low, privatization is working, thesecondary debt market is growing, capital is returning,exports are expanding, and rising imports have begun to cutthe trade surplus. But GATT questioned the government'smaintaining close links with industry to improve economicperformance.                                                                                                          AFRICAN IVORY BAN TO CONTINUE                                                                                                          Five African countries agreed to a continued moratorium onglobal ivory trade. Botswana, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Namibia andSouth Africa, at a Japanese meeting on trade in endangeredspecies, said the voluntary ban would allow time to create atrading system to discourage illegal ivory dealings.                                                                                                          MANILA'S ECONOMIC PLAN CLEARED                                                                                                          The International Monetary Fund approved the Philippines'economic stabilization program. Manila hopes to attract about$5 billion in foreign loans and aid to spur long-termeconomic growth. The IMF will immediately release $80 millionof a $370 million standby-credit facility. The 1992 programseeks to slash the government budget deficit 66% to 9 billionpesos ($357.1 million) through spending cuts and increasedrevenues. Manila must try to tame inflation to 10% from lastyear's 17.7% average rate. The economic growth goal is 2.5%to 3%, compared with last year's 0.05% contraction.                                                                                                          TAIWAN OFFERS RECORD BUDGET                                                                                                          Taiwan proposed a record government budget of 1.086trillion New Taiwan dollars (US$43.39 billion) for the yearstarting July 1. The plan was hailed for potentiallystabilizing development and criticized for over-reliance ondebt.   The spending proposal represents an 11% increase fromfiscal 1992. Under the budget, Taipei will issue NT$235billion of bonds to cover a revenue shortfall. Bond issuancecould account for 22% of total revenue. Repaying that debt,economists said, could impede long-term economic developmentas Taiwan seeks to finance an estimated NT$8 trillion ofpublic-works expansion programs through 1996.   Revenue from taxes and government-run monopolies are torise 1.7%, far less than projected economic growth of 7%,reflecting tax evasion problems.   Defense spending, the biggest budget item, accounts for24% of the total. Educational and cultural spending come injust above the constitutionally required 15%. Economicdevelopment projects and social welfare spending represent11%.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          China said it won't switch to daylight-saving time thisyear, partly because it interferes with train schedulesacross the country's 2,500-mile width. But because China hasonly one time zone, western regions set their own schedulesso people don't have to get up several hours before sunrise.. . . A power failure cut electricity throughout Manila, withits eight million population, and surrounding provinces. Theoutage, blamed on a sudden overload in the badly deficientelectric utility, snarled traffic, trapped people inelevators and idled air conditioners in the 90-degree heat.</TEXT></DOC>
