The charge, which stems from last October's stock market crash, represents a reduction in intangible assets of acquired retail brokerage firms and costs of consolidating offices. The restructuring seeks to return the Philadelphia company &quot;to profitability in 1989,&quot; the company said. Last December, Hopper Soliday ceased to be a closed-end investment fund.    Separately, the company said it is considering issuing one common stock warrant for each four shares held. The proposed warrant would have a seven-year life, and entitle the holder to purchase one common share at a price currently estimated at 25% above the average market price during the 10 days preceding the record date. </TEXT></DOC>
