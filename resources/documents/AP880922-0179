Wright, who has become a lightning rod for Democrats on CentralAmerica policy, found himself again embroiled in controversy forhis revelation two days earlier that the Central IntelligenceAgency had instigated demonstrations aimed at provoking the leftistManagua government and sabotaging peace talks with the Contrarebels.   The speaker repeated that assertion to reporters, but contendedsuch CIA activity was already well known through news reports.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House on Thursday passed election yearanti-drug legislation that would severely punish recreational usersand murderers alike, but it could face constitutional tests ifenacted into law.   The 375-30 vote is not the final word on Congress' latest effortto respond to Americans' fears over drug abuse. The Senate stillmust consider its own anti-drug legislation, and a conference willlikely be needed to reconcile competing versions.   Despite constitutional concerns, even by sponsors, the tug ofelection-year politics was so strong that House members appearedwilling to enact the toughest possible bill and let the courtsdecide the legal questions later.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Mexican policeman was found guiltyThursday of the 1985 kidnap and torture murder of a U.S. drugagent, a slaying he once described to an undercover officer as ``amistake.''

Gemayel's stunning choice of a military Cabinet, led by armycommander Gen. Michel Aoun, came after civilian Moslem figuresrefused to take part in an interim Cabinet headed by a MaroniteCatholic premier.   Gemayel, 45, had to name a transtition government because thedeeply divided Parliament failed to choose a new presidentThursday. The constitution bars Gemayel from seeking anotherpresidential term.

For children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, thesame uncertainty remains. Some started classes with little or nofuss this year, while a boy in Illinois who has already fled onetown faced more protests in his new home.   ``AIDS Kills,'' said one sign carried by protesters in Illinois.``Help Keep AIDS Out of Our Schools,'' said another.   The National Association of Boards of Education is close tocompleting work on model guidelines which would permit HIV-infectedstudents to be admitted the same as any other student, saidKatherine Fraser, co-director of the association's Aids EducationProject.</TEXT><DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Decades of racism and black unemploymentmade it inevitable that Shreveport would see an outbreak ofviolence like this week's rock-throwing and arson following thekilling of a black man, a civil rights leader says.   ``Shreveport's been dodging the bullet for 25 years,'' saidLarry English of the local NAACP chapter.   The violence Tuesday and Wednesday nights, set off when a whitewoman shot a black man, was confined to a few blocks in CedarGrove, a mostly residential neighborhood of modest houses and smallbusinesses about six miles from downtown.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's savings institutions lost $7.5billion in the first half of this year, the government reportedThursday, as a Senate leader called for the biggest federal bailoutin history.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Sandamp;Ls lost $3.6 billion inthe April-June quarter, a modest improvement over the $3.9 billionloss of the first quarter.   Nevertheless, the industry in only the first half of the year isalready approaching the post-Depression record loss of $7.8 billionfor all of 1987.   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., whois retiring after building a reputation as a penny-pinchinglegislator during 31 years in office, said Thursday that the nextCongress will have to appropriate at least $20 billion _ about $81for every man, woman and child in the country _ to bail out theindustry.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of giant profitable corporationsthat legally paid no federal income tax was cut by more than halflast year, according to a new study, but backers of the landmark1986 tax overhaul said Thursday the figure may never drop to zero.   Sixteen of 250 profitable companies surveyed by Citizens for TaxJustice were able to wipe out their entire federal liability, downfrom 40 in 1986 and 72 in 1982, according to Citizens for TaxJustice, a Washington-based research group funded by unions,churches and social groups. Some of the 16 disputed the report.   Paul Huard, vice president of the National Association ofManufacturers, criticized the report for what he called ``thishorror-story type of argument.'' It is unfair to look at acompany's taxes for one year only, he said, adding that ``thenature of corporate profits and tax accounting being what it is,you are going to get these cyclical variations from year to year.''</TEXT><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled Thursdaythat before receiving a low-power license, Seabrook, N.H., plantowners must prove they can pay to decommission their reactor ifthey never secure a full-power commercial license.

Seabrook officials quickly expressed optimism that they would beable to file a plan to pay for decommissioning that will satisfythe commissioners.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Democrats failed Thursday to break aRepublican filibuster of a bill clouded in presidential politics toraise the $3.35 an hour minimum wage for the first time since 1981.   On a 53-43 vote _ six short of the 60 needed _ the Senaterefused to limit to 30 more hours debate on legislation by Sen.Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to raise the wage floor to $3.75 inJanuary, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.   ``It's only clear that there is a deliberate attempt to stallaction on this bill,'' said Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,D-W.Va., who called the Republican tactics a filibuster.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that raising theminimuand a scarlet macaw. The parrotscan be bought cheaply abroad and sold for $1,500 to $3,000 each inthe United States.   The defendants, Carlos Fernandez, 27, Jose Flores, 24, FelixValdes, 39, Nancy Lopez, 50, and Rigoberto Cherta Garcia, 42, areCuban nationals who live in Miami with legal alien status.   ``The government will show that these birds are endangeredspecies, that the defendants knew,'' said Assistant U.S. AttorneyDaniel Gelber. ``These birds are worth hundreds of thousands ofdollars _ figure approaching a quarter of a million dollars.''   Defense attorney Ellis Rubin said the government's case isreally ``for the birds.''   Rubin told the jury that the government would seek to prove``solely by circumstantial evidence'' that the birds came fromCuba. The attorney said the defendants are breeders who were onlymoving the birds from Miami to Marathon in the Florida Keys whenthey were arrested.   The U.S. Coast Guard received a distress signal from a boat inthe Florida Straits on April 3, which led to the discovery of aboat at Matecumbe Key with the birds aboard.   U.S. Customs Service agents said correspondence on the ship,including a letter from a woman asking to buy ``a girdle, sizemedium, that I need very much to go out,'' showed the boat had beenin Cuba. They also found Cuban coins, a bill from a hotel andsouvenirs of Cuba.   Each defendant is charged with three felony counts, one ofconspiracy to violate the Lacy Act and two counts each of violationof the act itself. If convicted, they face a maximum five-yearprison term and a $250,000 fine.   The Lacy Act controls the interstate transportation of rare andendangered species.   Special Agent Jennifer English of the U.S. Fisheries andWildlife Service said the birds are being housed at Metro Zoo insouthern Dade County.   Gelber and Assistant U.S. Attorney Allan Kaiser said thegovernment would seek forfeiture of the birds in a separate civilaction. If forfeited, the birds would be used for propagationpurposes, Ms. English said.</TEXT></DOC>
