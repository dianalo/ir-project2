Resultsof measuring the amount of photoelectrons for different geometrics ofa wave length shifter and a light pipe are presented. Analysis of theresults obtained has shown that to increase the light collection, useof multilayer optical fibers similar in structure is optimal. The bestresults on light collection are given with scintillator plates producedwith the casting technique in which two-layer optical fiber is bakedinside a scintillator. The count of electrons of 0.7 has been producedfrom each of two fiber edges. Inhomogeneity of response on plate dimensions(97x94x5 mm) constitutes +-0.7%. Results of investigation into lighttransmission methods have shown the advantage of optical-fiber lightextraction in laminated calorimeters as compared with use of plate-wavelength shifters. 7 refs.; 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
