(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists have found they can createhighly accurate animal versions of human diseases by insertingscrambled genes into unborn mice.   The new technique should allow researchers in some cases tocreate animal models on demand.   Such laboratory animals have long been important tools forstudying and curing illnesses. But until now, they have beendeveloped only by breeding animals to bring out naturally occurringdefects.   In the latest experiments, researchers from the WhiteheadInstitute for Biomedical Research at Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology produced so-called ``transgenic'' mice, animals with anextra, mutant copy of a normal gene.   This bad gene contained the same genetic error that causes afatal human birth defect called osteogenesis imperfecta Type II. Asa result, the mice were born with rubbery and missing bones, justlike humans with this disorder.   A report on the research, directed by Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch, waspublished in the March 10 issue of the British journal Nature.   ``This study constitutes the first example of the generation ofan animal model of a human genetic disease by introducing preciselydefined alterations into the normal gene and then transferring themutant gene into transgenic mice,'' the researchers wrote.   At the University of Washington, Dr. Peter Byers said the newtechnique should help researchers understand diseases that causeshort stature and a variety of other disorders resulting fromdefective genes.   ``You now have the potential to do that with almost any othergene in which you can make mutations,'' Byers said. ``It's a way offinding out more about other genes and their functions.''   Although many diseases are thought to arise from geneticdefects, the precise genetic causes are still unknown.   Researchers say it should be possible to tinker with specificmouse genes, put them into unborn mice and then see if the animalshave diseases that resemble human ailments.   The MIT research was conducted on the gene that produces Type 1collagen, a material essential for healthy bones and tendons.   The human collagen molecule is a chain of 1,000 amino acids. Ofthese, 333 are the amino acid glycine. If just one glycine in thischain is replaced by another amino acid, the collagen is defectiveand the disease osteogenesis imperfecta results.   The blueprint that the body uses to assemble these amino acidsis contained in one gene. If this code is garbled by a singlerandom mutation, the gene can instruct the body to build collagenincorrectly, putting glycine in the wrong place.   The researchers made this kind of mutation in the gene thatproduces Type 1 collagen in mice. They transferred the genes intosingle-cell mouse embryos.   The genes produced defective collagen and the mice were bornwith the same defects as babies with osteogenesis imperfecta.   ``Some of them were dramatic,'' Jaenisch said. ``They weremissing bones. You poke their heads, and there is just no bone inthem.''   Having an animal model for osteogenesis imperfecta should helpresearchers learn more about the disease, but it isn't likely toproduce a way to treat it because the defect does its lethal damagebefore birth.   One potential use of the technique, Jaenisch said, would be tolearn how the body uses other kinds of collagen.   ``There are 20 different collagens, and nobody knows what thefunctions of these collagens are,'' he said in an interview. ``Forany of these collagens, this approach will be perfectly suited.''</TEXT></DOC>
