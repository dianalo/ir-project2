(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two public hospitals in Missouri willstop performing abortions because of Monday's Supreme Court ruling,and the governor set up a task force to consider furtherrestrictions on abortion.   ``We in Missouri will press on to protect the lives of our futuregenerations and literally to protect the future of the state,'' Gov.John Ashcroft said at a news conference after the court upheld keyportions of Missouri's 1986 abortion law.   In its ruling, the high court stopped short of overturning its1973 Roe vs. Wade decision which barred the states from outlawingabortion. But it restored Missouri regulations that among otherthings prevent the use of public facilities for abortions, requiredoctors to determine, when possible, whether a fetus at least 20weeks old is capable of surviving outside the womb, and ban the useof tax money for ``encouraging or counseling'' women to haveabortions not necessary to save life.   State health officials said only 90 of the 17,382 abortionsperformed in Missouri last year were performed in two publichospitals, Truman Medical Center in Kansas City and the Universityof Missouri Hospital and Clinics in Columbia.   Dr. James Mongan, executive director of the 360-bed TrumanMedical Center, said the hospital will stop performing abortions,which in the past have been paid for by the client. Abortions inMissouri have not been financed with public money since the mid1970s.   Mongan said the number of requests for abortions at the hospitalhas dropped over the years because the procedure can be doneelsewhere. UMC officials said their physicians will also stopperforming abortions.   ``This is a tragedy ... that will affect mostly low-incomewomen,'' said B.J. Isaacson-Jones, executive director ofReproductive Health Services, the private St. Louis clinic that wasparty to the case. ``I am filled with grief, rage and bitterdisappointment.''   RHS would ``continue to provide all choices to women, regardlessof their ability to pay,'' she said.   The cost of abortions for low-income women at the private, St.Louis clinic, is determined on a sliding scale. The standard fee forfirst-trimester abortions is $260.   Judith Widdicombe, founder of the clinic, called the decision anoutrage.   ``There's a movement in this country that will not tolerate this.It will become our Vietnam of the 1990s,'' she said.   ``Their goal is no abortions,'' Widdicombe said. ``Next will comebirth control.''   A 30-year-old St. Louis woman who had an abortion earlier thisyear was at the clinic for the announcement of the decision.   ``This is going to go on and on,'' said the woman, who asked thather name not be used. ``And the quiet silent majority is going tohave to speak up. Every organization that's pro-choice is going tohave to fight a thousand times harder. It's like dominoes. If yougive up once, they keep falling down one by one.''   Ashcroft said he will form a task force to recommend additionalmeasures ``to protect the health of mothers and protect the lives ofunborn children by reducing the number of abortions.''   ``I think there's a clear message the pendulum has changeddirection,'' said Lou DeFeo of the Missouri Catholic Conference,which helped draft Missouri's abortion law. ``The court hasapparently extended the invitation for legislatures across thecountry to further protect human life from its beginning. It opensnew doors.''   Missouri's abortion statute quickly drew a legal attack after itpassed in 1986 and a federal court blocked its implementation evenbefore it took effect.   That was what supporters wanted because the law was passed withthe intention of making it a vehicle for challenging Roe vs. Wade.   The Missouri case drew national attention, and a flood of briefsfor and against abortion poured into the Supreme Court, which heardarguments on the issue last April.   The law was the Missouri Legislature's third effort to restrictabortions since the 1973 decision. Parts of a 1974 law enacted toget around Roe vs. Wade were overturned by the Supreme Court in1976. Another law requiring that abortions during the fourth tosixth months of pregnancy be conducted in hospitals was overturnedin 1983.   The Legislature voted overwhelmingly to pass the latest law,which included a provision that ``the life of each human beingbegins at conception.'' The Supreme Court on Monday ruled thatprovision was constitutional.   Attorney General William Webster, who argued the case before theSupreme Court, said the decision ``means substantial prerogativewill be returned to all 50 states.''   ``It doesn't take us back before Roe, but it does suggest stateswill have more power than they have had in the past two decades,''said Webster, a Republican.</TEXT></DOC>
