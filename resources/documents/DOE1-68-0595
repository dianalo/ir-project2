The impacts to be considered onthe health and safety of the general public include radiological andnonradiological effects. Economics are included in that excessive disposalcosts deprive the public of alternative personal expenditures. A figure-of-meritmethodology is developed to assist in identifying the disposal site andtechnology having the least overall impact. The figure of merit beginswith a nominal positive value selected to represent the societal benefitsderived from operations that result in the generation of radioactivewaste. An incremental adjustment, either positive or negative, is madeto the figure of merit for each impact considered. An economic basisprovides a common denominator between impacts and the figure of merit.</TEXT></DOC>
