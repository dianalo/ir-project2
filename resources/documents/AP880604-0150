Democrat Jesse Jackson is the only other contestant left of 13would-be presidents who toed the starting line last winter. But evenhis campaign manager concedes that Dukakis is likely to wrap up theparty's nomination by the end of the week.   For the record, New Jersey, California, Montana and New Mexicoare holding primary elections on Tuesday, with 466 Democraticconvention delegates at stake and 265 up for grabs on the Republicanside.   But Bush is unopposed, as he has been for weeks, and he skippedlightly through the final states on the calendar. Instead, he hasspent the last several days trying to figure out how to end adownward spiral that has left him trailing Dukakis by double-digitmargins in some national polls.   ``I've never felt more relaxed, never felt more convinced we'reon the right track,'' he told reporters late last week after fourdays of skull sessions with aides and outside advisers.   The only suspense left in the Democratic primary campaign iswhether Dukakis' expected sweep of the final four contests will givehim the 2,081 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.   ``I hope on Tuesday we will have won the nomination,'' says SusanEstrich, Dukakis' campaign manager. The Massachusetts governorintends to campaign extensively as the nominee-in-waiting in theweeks before the convention opens in July, as well as open serioustalks with Jackson and select a running mate.   The hope among campaign aides is for a display of unity in theweeks to come from the other primary rivals, including Sen. PaulSimon, Richard Gephardt and Albert Gore Jr.   The Republicans have a unity display lined up already.   The vice president will make an appearance at a ``Unity 88''conference in Denver late next week, where Sen. Bob Dole, Rep. JackKemp and Pat Robertson _ former rivals _ also will speak.   Campaign manager Lee Atwater says Bush will use his trip to beginspeaking out more forcefully against Dukakis and provide a ``prettygood taste of the flavor of the campaign for the summer.''   The last act of the primary season means an end to months ofnon-stop campaigning for Jackson, but not an end to the campaign.   He has been pressing Dukakis on issues ranging from the budget topolicy toward South Africa in recent weeks in an apparent effort toinfluence the drafting of the party platform.   On the topic of the vice presidential nominiation, Dukakis andJackson take turns probing and feinting.   Jackson hasn't said he wants it, but says he's entitled toconsideration.   Dukakis, under intense pressure from many party regulars to lookelsewhere for a running mate but aware that he needs Jackson'sfollowers to support him in the fall, praises his rival lavishly andagrees that he is entitled to consideration. But he says the resultsof the primaries do not entitle Jackson to a ``leg up'' on any otherpotential running mate.   Whatever follows, the final days of the primary campaign seemedalmost becalmed.   Jackson's aides said they were spending about $700,000 ontelevision in California, and would limit themselves to radioadvertisements in New Jersey. That was about one quarter of theCalifornia budget envisioned three weeks ago when Jackson dreamed ofambushing Dukakis on the final day of the season.   Dukakis spent nothing on advertising in New Jersey and less than$250,000 in California. What money he did spend went to air acommercial that seemed a preview of the fall campaign. It touted hisefforts to reduce crime in Massachusetts and said he forged hisaccomplishments with ``hard work, integrity, leadership. We coulduse some of that ... in the White House,'' said the announcer.   Bush spent no money at all on advertising in the final primarystates. He also curtailed his travel schedule, wary of bumping upagainst the $27 million federal spending limit for pre-conventioncampaigning.   That laid-back type of campaigning, particularly in the statethat will provide the largest single block of electoral votes in thefall, was a marked contrast to the frenzy of early contests.   Several of the contenders spent roughly $750,000 _ the legalmaximum _ in Iowa alone on the Feb. 8 caucuses that opened theseason.   Bush finished third in that opening event, well behind Dole andRobertson. But he dusted himself off, defeated Dole and the rest ofthe field in the New Hampshire primary, and the rout was on.   The vice president effectively locked up the nomination a fewweeks later in a Super Tuesday sweep of 16 primary states on March8. One by one, his rivals dropped from the field, and the vicepresident gained a mathematical lock on the nomination whenPennsylvania voted on April 26.   Dukakis finished third, as well, in Iowa, behind Gephardt andSimon. But he rebounded to win the primary in New Hampshire nextdoor to his Massachusetts home. In the turbulent weeks ofcampaigning that followed, Dukakis carried five primary states onSuper Tuesday, as did Jackson and Gore.   Simon won his home state primary in Illinois a week later, withJackson second and Dukakis third. Jackson dealt Dukakis a stingingdefeat 10 days later in the Michigan caucuses. Talk of a brokeredconvention hit a high note.   But the Massachusetts governor began a strong spring comeback afew days later in Connecticut, and went on to win nine out of thenext 10 primaries, eliminating his rivals one by one, until onlyJackson remained.</TEXT></DOC>
