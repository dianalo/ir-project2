 While Apple's Macintosh computers support speechsynthesis, IBM PC-compatible microcomputers need added voicedevices in order to speak.andP;  Speech synthesis products cost from$250 to $4,000 dollars depending on voice quality.andP;  Theworkstation using the voice device should be an Intel 80286- or80386-based machine with expansion ports, a serial port, 640Kbytesof RAM and a video adapter.andP;  Installing the voice device isusually simple, but hardware and memory allocation conflictsoccasionally arise.andP;  Problems can usually be solved by loading thespeech synthesizer's screen reader into a different section ofmemory and changing interrupt settings on other boards in theworkstation.andP;  Large print screens and braille printers can alsobenefit visually-impaired users, and printed material can beoptically scanned and read aloud by the workstation.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Voice SynthesisVoice I-O EquipmentBlindLocal Area NetworksTutorialPlanningSpecial-Purpose Computers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Talking NetworksandM;Computers inhabit many science fiction tales.andP;  These intelligent machinesoften have some very human-like qualities, such as the power of the spokenword and the ability to act independently.andP;  While computers are stillcontrolled by their programmers and users, you don't have to wait until theturn of the century to employ a talking workstation in your office.andP;  Atalking workstation is very useful for a disabled computer user, andmainstream spinoff applications can also turn speech into strategy.andM;A LAN is an electronic equalizer.andP;  If a personal computer is equipped withspeech, a visually impaired worker does not have to rely on others to read tohim.andP;  They can send electronic mail or documents.andP;  The computer then reads italoud.andM;The federal government has just changed the Rehabilitation Act to includeadaptive equipment.andP;  The new amendment states that the federal government canonly purchase equipment that is adaptable for the disabled community's use.andO;If a computer or other device cannot be used by a disabled person because ofbuilt-in barriers, the federal government cannot buy it.andP;  Since thegovernment is one of the largest buyers of computers, this amended law isparticularly significant.andM;If you work for a private company, you may not be affected directly; however,the company is still bound by federal and state regulations mandating thehiring of qualified handicapped people.andP;  If you do hire a disabled person,you must adapt his or her job site and workstation with special equipment, ajob that causes much head-scratching among the mainstream computer community.andO;This confusion results because adaptive equipment is a topic that is onlyconfronted when the need arises.andM;You can create a talking PC with no special tools by using off-the-shelfhardware and software.andP;  The next step is to put this workstation on the LAN,which involves pitfalls of its own.andM;Ways of Making It TalkandM;If you want to make an IBM PC or compatible talk, you need a speech circuitcard or an externally driven speech synthesizer.andP;  Since the IBM PCmotherboard does not currently support speech (as does the Apple Macintosh),you need to add a voice device to make the machine speak.andM;A number of third-party vendors make speech synthesis products.andP;  Some sellspeech hardware, others carry only speech software, while others can sell youa total system package, including installation and training.andM;The current crop of speech synthesis products range from about $250 to$4,000, depending on the speech quality.andP;  For about $1,000, you can expect toobtain a good speech card or external box as well as software to turnoff-the-shelf software into talking applications.andP;  However, you can go as lowas a few hundred dollars, if you are willing to tolerate a robotic voice.andM;Voice quality generally is not a visually impaired computer user's primarycriterion.andP;  He or she is more concerned with the functionality of thesoftware that drives the voice device since it can make or break a person'sability to use a piece of commercial software.andM;The screen reader is responsible for making verbal sense out of the screen.andO;For example, using hot keys, a user can instruct the screen reader to readselect windows on the screen.andP;  A user can also tell the screen reader toverbalize dialogue boxes and pop-up windows automatically when they appear.andO;A screen reader is a memory-resident program that sits in the background andredirects all keyboard input and screen text to the voice device.andP;  Since itlacks a voice, it requires internal or external speech hardware to providethe sound output.andP;  The screen reader can be thought of as a device driver; itopens a permanent pathway from the keyboard and screen to the voicesynthesizer.andM;Echo PC from Street Electronics (Carpinteria, Calif.) is a standalone,serially driven, unlimited vocabulary, text-to-speech synthesizer.andP;  (Asynthesizer is said to have an unlimited vocabulary when it can speak anyword or phrase presented to it via the keyboard or screen.)andP;  At $250, Echo PCis one of the least expensive voice products commercially available, but itsvoice quality is highly robotic.andP;  It interfaces to almost any computer via astandard RS-232 port, much like a printer connects to a PC.andP;  The addition ofa commercial screen reader allows the Echo PC unit to verbalize off-the-shelfsoftware.andP;  If you want something with a more understandable voice quality,you should move up in price.andM;The newest voice device to hit the adaptive market is Personal VerbalEmulation in Real Time, or Personal VERT.andP;  This $1,400 system fromTelesensory (Mountain View, Calif.) is capable of turning almost any PC intoa talking computer.andP;  It consists of a half-sized text-to-speech card andMS-DOS-based screen reading software.andP;  Personal VERT can verbalize textletter-by-letter, word-by-word, line-by-line, or by the entire screen.andP;  It iscompatible with most networks and it can be adjusted to deal with interruptand memory addressing conflicts.andM;GW Micro (Fort Wayne, Ind.) sells speech hardware and software for the IBM PCplatform.andP;  It markets an unlimited text-to-speech synthesizer card calledSounding Board and a top-notch screen reading program aptly named Vocal-Eyes.andO;This hardware/software combination makes an effective talking LANworkstation.andP;  Interrupts can be changed using DIP switches, thereby avoidingclashes with network interface cards.andP;  The hardware can emulate other popularvoice devices.andP;  The Vocal-Eyes screen reading software is the latest to hitthe market, and is one of the few programs that can be loaded intoconventional, expanded, or extended memory.andP;  Depending on the amount ofmemory required by the network operating system, this flexibility is ofparamount importance.andP;  The Sounding Board and Vocal-Eyes combination iscompatible with commercial macro programs, which allow you to customize thespeech environment to a user's skill level.andM;Since the Mac has a built-in voice chip, it only requires software to turn itinto a talking workstation.andP;  However, few voice products are available.andO;Outspoken from Berkeley Systems (Berkeley, Calif.) runs on the Mac Plus andhigher.andP;  Since Outspoken is not completely compatible with all Mac software,you will have to test it with your particular network operating systemsoftware.andM;PC RequirementsandM;Before you can create an effective talking workstation, you have to delegatea machine to the task.andP;  The talking workstation is a shared network resource,similar to a modem or optical disk server.andM;The best computer for the job is a 286 or 386 with plenty of expansion ports,at least one true serial port, 640KB of standard memory, and a video adapter.andO;Expanded or extended memory is a nice addition.andP;  If you choose a Mac, itshould have at least 1MB of memory.andM;Expansion slots are necessary for the speech hardware.andP;  Internal speechhardware will occupy at least one slot.andP;  If you choose an external speechdevice, you need a dedicated serial port, and an external serial portconsumes another slot.andP;  The computer should also have at least 640KB ofmemory since the speech software must be loaded into the 640KB controlled byDOS.andP;  Expanded or extended memory is necessary if the PC has insufficient RAMto load the speech, network, and other applications software.andP;  The choice ofa video system is purely a matter of your system's graphics requirements.andO;You can create a talking workstation using almost any video monitor card.andO;The speech hardware and software will speak ANSI-compatible graphics, but itwill not translate bit-mapped graphics into intelligible descriptions.andM;InstallationandM;Although many different hardware and software products on the market cangenerate synthesized speech, the basic installation process is very similar.andO;Simply install the voice card in an unused slot in the PC.andP;  Most voice cardshave volume controls and speaker/headphone jacks on the rear panel, whichmakes it simple to connect either headphones or speakers to the speechdevice.andM;If the PC has a hard disk, you should put the screen reader software into itsown subdirectory.andP;  If the PC has only floppy drives, you need to create aboot disk for the speech hardware.andP;  In either case, you should make a batchfile to load the speech software automatically upon boot-up or upon requestfrom the user.andP;  If a visually impaired and sighted person will share the PC,you may not want to have the system automatically boot up talking every time.andM;Once the system is up and talking, you should load the network operatingsystem and log into the network.andP;  (Always load the speech software first;this allows the blind user to control the computer via speech output, andother programs cannot wrest control from the speech software.)andP;  Loading thescreen reader and network software into RAM often leaves little room forapplications.andP;  Sometimes the screen reader software is so memory-hungry thatthe user won't be able to log into the LAN at all.andP;  If this occurs, you mustload either the speech software or the network driver into expanded orextended memory.andM;I have found the Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager, a popular memorymanager, to be compatible with many speech programs.andP;  Depending on whatsoftware you wish to run, you may have to load the screen reader into highmemory, or you may have to load other applications into the space above640KB.andP;  Either way, you should be able to load everything you need, but youmay have to fiddle with the system to get everything right.andP;  Because a 386PC's memory maps are more standard and better behaved than ATs or XTs, a 386is preferable when expanded or extended memory is needed.andM;An expanded memory board is also helpful, but it is a more expensive option.andO;The Intel AboveBoard works well with voice devices and can provide megabytesof extra memory.andM;Lack of memory isn't the only barrier; hardware conflicts also arise.andO;Undoubtedly, you will encounter hardware interrupt conflicts with networkinterface cards, video adapter cards, hard or floppy disk controller cards,or other interface cards plugged into the would-be talking workstation.andP;  Theconflict is usually between the speech card and only one other card.andM;You can end-run around these interrupt conflicts by careful planning orsophisticated trial and error.andP;  Since no two cards can use the same interruptnumber, each card must be set to a unique interrupt to avoid conflicts.andP;  (Thecards' manuals will detail the available interrupts.)andP;  Your task is to seteach card to a different interrupt number.andP;  You can discover the offendingcard by pulling all unnecessary cards out of the PC and then reinserting thecards one by one until you recreate the problem.andP;  Once you know which card isgiving you trouble, you can flip its DIP switches to alter the interruptnumber, or you can change the DIP switches on the speech synthesizer.andM;The network operating system is loaded after the speech or other adaptivesoftware.andP;  I have tested many speech devices with Banyan VINES, NovellNetWare, and Artisoft Lantastic and had very good results in all cases.andP;  Thebeginning of each installation is filled with a fury of flipping DIP switchesand software gymnastics, but every installation has worked out.andM;Once the PC is logged into the network, run an application you want to adaptfor speech output, such as WordPerfect, dBase, or 1-2-3.andP;  The screen reader'selbow grease enters the picture here since you must create a number ofwindows to read the highly formatted text screens.andP;  After the application isloaded, you must decide what windows need to be made.andP;  Look at theapplication on the screen to decide what regions are dedicated to statuslines, dialog boxes, pop-up windows, menus, etc.andP;  Locate and write down thescreen row and column numbers for these windows, then key them into thescreen reader.andP;  (The voice hardware and software manuals will explain thiscompletely.)andP;  Once accomplished, save the speech environment to a file.andP;  Mostscreen readers allow you to save this information in a standard DOS fileformat.andM;Not Just TalkandM;In addition to unlimited vocabulary speech output, you can add other forms ofadaptive technology to the LAN, including large-print hardware or software, abraille printer, and braille terminal.andM;You can add large-print capability to the LAN by slipping an extra expansioncard into the PC, or you may add large print via software only.andP;  Thelarge-print hardware systems are usually bundled with a mouse andcursor-tracking software, which is similar to a speech-based screen reader.andO;The large-print software can be programmed to speak only certain colors, suchas red or inverse video, or to track inverse menu bars so that when you movethe arrow keys the text is automatically verbalized.andP;  The software can alsovary the size, shape, and color of the video image.andP;  Because large-printsystems use larger letters overall, fewer characters fit on the screen at onetime.andP;  To compensate for less information per screen, a person uses a mouseto move the large-print environment around the screen.andP;  The process issimilar to moving around in a word processor, where you can see on the screenonly half of what appears on a hard-copy printout.andM;If the PC has few available expansion slots, you can provide large-printcapability via software only.andP;  A software-only approach has the advantages ofbeing quick to install, portable from one machine to another, andinexpensive.andP;  The disadvantage is possible conflict with existing videocards.andM;The current crop of large-print programs generate the larger-than-standardimage using the installed video card.andP;  For the most part, large-printsoftware supports the existing mainstream standards, including EGA, CGA, andVGA, but it may not be able to deal with exotic clone cards.andP;  If youexperience this problem, you generally are not out of luck.andP;  May companiesthat sell large-print software can also sell you the appropriate video card.andO;Video adapters are much less expensive than the large-print hardware/softwarepackages described earlier.andM;You can put many of these large-print software packages on the LAN, and havelarge-print emulation on any workstation, as long as the proper video cardsare installed in the workstations.andM;LP DOS from Vision ware (Brookline, Mass.), Optelect from Optelec USA(Harvard, Mass.), ZoomText from [Al.sup.2] (Atlanta), and Qwerty Large Printfrom HFK Software (Lincoln, Mass.) are large-print programs for the PC.andO;Inlarge from berkeley Systems is large-print software for the Macintosh.andM;You can add a braille printer to any workstation on the network.andP;  Brailleprinters look like standard printers, except they use heavier stock paper andproduce raised dots rather than ink images.andP;  They are generally slower thandot matrix printers, but some printers can produce a 100 characters persecond.andP;  Like a standard printer, a braille printer connects to any standardcommunications or printer port via standard interface cables.andP;  The PC mustrun special braille translation software to produce correctly formattedbraille.andP;  The user sends word processing files through the translator.andP;  Theresult is two files--the original file and the braille file.andP;  The braillefile is sent to the braille printer, and the original can be sent to anystandard printer for ink-print copy.andP;  This setup enables users to producebraille and print in parallel.andM;Telesensory's Versa-Point, Romeo from Enabling Technologies (Stuart, Fla.),andO;and Marathon are braille printers for any computer with a serial or parallelport.andM;Braille-access terminals may also be attached to the LAN workstation.andP;  Abraille-access terminal can control the PC via a braille-type keyboard, andthe screen image can be read in braille.andP;  Such a system has two keyboards,original and braille, and two displays, also original and braille.andP;  Thebraille screen consists of the line, either 20, 40, or 80 characters long,which can be moved anywhere on the screen, thus allowing the user to read andreread in braille any portion of the video image.andP;  The user can also entertext and commands at the braille keyboard.andM;Optical ScanningandM;Visually impaired people have always had difficulty getting printed materialread or translated into braille.andP;  It takes hours to read a book onto cassettetape and can take even longer to type a book on a braille typewriter.andO;Optical character recognition (OCR) technology has removed that barrier.andO;Products are available to read and translate printed text into speech or acomputer-readable format.andP;  Using scanning technology, a visually impairedperson can read many forms of the printed word.andP;  A network can distributethis information to many people at a much lower cost than purchasing thenecessary devices for each.andM;A scanning system is tremendously flexible.andP;  Scanned text can be sent to apersonal computer, where it can be translated into large print, hard-copybraille, speech, standard print, etc.andP;  Systems are available to scan aprinted page, speak it aloud, and then run off a braille hard copy.andM;The Kurzweil Personal Reader is a standalone OCR system that can be used withmost personal computers that have serial interface ports.andP;  The machine readstext using its DECtalk synthesizer, and the text can be uploaded to a LANusing any telecommunications software.andP;  The sytem retails for $8,000 to$12,000, depending on the options.andP;  The trend, however, is to use lessexpensive off-the-shelf sysems to accomplish the same purpose.andM;The Calera (Santa Clara, Calif.) OCR board, designed to drive most opticalflat-bed scanners, can function as the core of a high-tech reading machine,but at a significantly lower cost than that of a dedicated one.andP;  Some vendorsadd special scanning software to make the scanner work more efficiently withspeech output devices.andP;  I have found that the Calera board works well withHewlett-Packard ScanJet and Panasonic scanners.andM;A scanner is a vital network device, not only for the visually impaired, butfor all LAN users.andP;  A LAN is the medium to share this costly peripheral.andO;Instead of typing documents into a system, you can scan them into anelectronic library stored on optical disks.andP;  The scanner could producemachine-readable manuals and other information for all employees.andM;Speech Front-EndandM;To maximize you investment, employ adaptive technology in two shfits.andP;  Duringthe day, a visually impaired worker could use the speech device to operate anetwork workstation.andP;  At night, the speech system could function as anintelligent and highly impressive answering machine system.andM;DECtalk from Digital Equipment Corp.(Maynard,Mass.) can function as astandalone synthesizer and has sophisticated telephone interface capability.andO;DECtalk can be connected simultaneously to the telephone system and the LAN.andO;At the end of the day, DECtalk could be brought into the phone system byrunning a dedicated PC program, which would instruct DECtalk how to answerthe telephone and what to respond depending on what buttons the callerpresses.andP;  Such a device can be used to take orders at night (or during theday for that matter) and can also function as an answering machine.andP;  Althoughthe system cannot record incoming calls to a hard disk, text files can beread to the caller and touch-tone interactions can be conducted.andP;  Such asystem can turn speech into strategic power--the ability to performoperations your competition hasn't thought of yet.andM;The FutureandM;Talking computers have left the pages of science fiction forever and havefirmly entered today's mainstream computer technology.andP;  The adaptive devicesbeing used by the disabled today will undoubtedly become the voices and otherhuman-like powers of the computers of the future.andP;  The adaptive technologynow being proved will be the seeds of engineering that develop the newpossibilities of tomorrow.andM;Joe Lazzaro is the director of an Adaptive Technology Program for theCommonwealth of Massachusetts.andP;  He is also founder of Talking ComputerSystems (Watertown, Mass.), an adaptive technology, microcomputer consultingfirm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
