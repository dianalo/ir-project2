Background</ITAG>The Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kansas AMLR programon February 1, 1982. Information pertinent to the general background, revisions,and amendments to the initial program submission, as well as the Secretary'sfindings and the disposition of comments can be found in the February 1,1982, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 4513). Deficiencies that resulted in theconditional approval were corrected by the State, and on June 3, 1983,all conditions of approval were removed by OSMRE. The Secretary's findingscan be found in the June 3, 1983 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (48 FR 24874).Information concerning the previously approved plan and the proposed amendmentsmay be obtained from the agency offices listed under <T2>``ADDRESSES''.</T2>The Secretary has adopted regulations that specify the content requirementsof a State reclamation plan and the criteria for plan approval (30 CFRPart 884). The regulations provide that a State may submit to OSMRE proposedamendments or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendmentsor revisions change the scope or major policies followed by the State inthe conduct of its reclamation program, the Deputy Director must followthe procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14 in approving or disapproving anamendment or revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Proposed Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated September 30, 1988, Kansas submitted a reclamation planamendment to OSMRE (Administrative Record No. AML-KS 93). The amendmentconsists of procedures to be used in the implementation and administrationof emergency reclamation projects.On September 19, 1983, OSMRE informed the States and Tribes of the opportunityto amend their reclamation plans to include responsibility for administeringemergency response reclamation activities (47 FR 42729). For a State toundertake such activities as part of its reclamation program, it must demonstratethat it has the statutory authority to administer emergency reclamationactivities, the technical capabilities to design and supervise emergencyresponse work and the appropriate procurement procedures to quickly respondto emergencies either directly or through contractors. The State of Kansashas submitted material demonstrating compliance with these requirements.OSMRE announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the October 27, 1988,<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 43449-43450), and, in the same notice,opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a publichearing on its substantive adequacy. One public comment was received byNovember 28, 1988, the close of the public comment period. Since no onerequested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, the scheduledhearing was cancelled.Following a thorough review of the Kansas amendment, OSMRE notified theState on November 29, 1988, of the need for several nonsubstantive editorialchanges and clarifications. On December 6, 1988, Kansas submitted the necessaryclarifications and editorial corrections. The Deputy Director has determinedthat these corrections are insignificant in nature and accordingly requireno further public comment.Under SMCRA, OSMRE codifies the approved requirements of individual Statesincluding decisions on State reclamation plans and amendments under parts900 to 950 of 30 CFR Subchapter T. Provisions relating to Kansas are foundin 30 CFR Part 916.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Deputy Director's Findings</ITAG>In accordance with Section 405 of SMCRA, the Deputy Director of OSMRE findsthat Kansas has submitted an amendment to its Abandoned Mine Land reclamationplan and has determined pursuant to 30 CFR 884.15 and the criteria forassumption of emergency response activities specified in 47 FR 42729-42730,that:1. The State provided adequate notice and opportunity for public commentin the development of the plan amendment and that the record does not reflectmajor unresolved controversies.2. Views of other Federal agencies having an interest in the plan or amendmenthave been solicited and considered.3. The State has the legal authority, policies and administrative structurenecessary to implement the amendment.4. The proposed plan amendment meets all requirements of the OSMRE AMLRprogram provisions.5. The State has an approved Surface Mining Regulatory Program.6. The proposed plan amendment is in compliance with all applicable Stateand Federal laws and regulations.7. State emergency reclamation activities (47 FR 42729-42730).Kansas submitted a comprehensive package to demonstrate that it has thestatutory authority to administer emergency reclamation activities, thetechnical capabilities to design and supervise emergency response work,and the appropriate procurement procedures to quickly respond to emergencieseither directly or through contractors.Based upon OSMRE's substantive review and after considering other agencycomments, the Deputy Director finds that the Kansas Department of Healthand Environment has complied with the emergency program guidelines andqualifies for assumption of emergency response capability within the constraintsimposed by law and Departmental regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Public and Agency Comments</ITAG>As discussed in the section of this notice entitled ``Discussion of Amendment,''OSMRE solicited public comment and provided opportunity for a public hearingon the proposed amendment. Since no one requested an opportunity to testify,the public hearing scheduled for November 21, 1988, was cancelled. Onecomment was received from the public during the comment period, which closedon November 28, 1988. A summary of the comment and its disposition follows:The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality suggested that OSMRE providea description of the benefits that will result to the public from transferof emergency reclamation authority to the State of Kansas. OSMRE findsthat the following benefits will result from such transfer:(a) Administrative costs will be reduced.(b) Accessibility of the administering agency to the public and responsetime to emergency complaints will improve because the State Program officeis located in the center of the major area of historical emergency complaints.(c) The State's overall control of the Abandoned Mine Land ReclamationProgram will be enhanced.The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality suggested that a cost/benefitanalysis be performed to ensure that the proposed transfer of emergencyreclamation authority is in the best financial interest of the AbandonedMine Land Reclamation Fund. OSMRE has performed an analysis of State vs.Federal costs and found that State administration of the program shouldbe less costly.Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(2), comments were also solicited from variousFederal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kansas plan.No comments were received in response to the solicitation.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Deputy Director's Decision</ITAG>Based upon the findings enumerated above, the Deputy Director is approvingthe Kansas amendment. A copy of the approved amendment can be obtainedby contacting the offices listed under ``<T2>ADDRESSES''.</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Matters</ITAG>1. Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act OSMRE examined this final rulemaking under Executive order 12291 and hasdetermined that on November 23, 1987, the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) granted OSMRE an exemption from sections 3, 4, 7 and 8 of ExecutiveOrder 12291 for actions directly related to approval or disapproval ofState AMLR plans and amendments. Therefore, this action is exempt frompreparation of a regulatory impact analysis and regulatory review of OMB.This rulemaking was examined pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act(5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and the Department of the Interior determined thatthis document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities. No burden will be imposed on entities operatingin compliance with the Act.2. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act Furthermore, OSMRE has determined that the approval of State and TribalAMLR plans and amendments is categorically excluded from compliance withthe National Environmental Policy Act by the Department of Interior's Manual,516 DM 6, Appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(30). 3. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date </ITAG>The final rule is effective upon date of publication. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d),a rule may not be made effective less than 30 days after publication, unless,among other things, good cause exists and is published with the rule. Goodcause exists to make the final rule effective upon publication because:(1) Kansas' Department of Health and Environment is staffed and preparedto administer the emergency reclamation program, and (2) OSMRE wishes toexpedite grant assistance to the State to initiate emergency reclamationwork. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR 916 </ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 5, 1989 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
