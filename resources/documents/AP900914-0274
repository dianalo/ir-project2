World Bank first vice president Moeen Qureshi said the loanswill help finance reforming Argentina's state sector, reordergovernment relations with provinces and develop programs in thehousing, health and public education.   ``We hope that in the next six months we can bring forward atleast some of these programs,'' Qureshi said. He did not specifyprecisely how the $1 billion would be spent or when.   President Carlos Menem's 14-month-old government is sellingstate companies, paring public employment, curtailing subsidies,hiking public service rates and shutting down money-losing publicbanks.   The government already has eliminated price and currencyexchange controls, partially deregulated the oil industry,increased foreign currency reserves, narrowed the fiscal deficitand proposed to reform the tax code and make the Central Bankindependent of the government.   ``I think the turnaround they have made in the fiscal area isquite impressive,'' Qureshi said.   In the process, however, social services have declined markedly.Schools operate sporadically because of boycotts by teachersdemanding higher pay. Public hospitals barely have enough funds forfood, let alone medicine.   The austerity measures also have contributed to recession. Realwages have shrunk and tens of thousands of people have been thrownout of work, and are unlikely to find jobs in the private sector.   Apart from the new $1 billion loan, Qureshi said the bank hasapproved $4.4 billion in loans to Argentina since 1961, andArgentina has repaid $1 billion. Another $1 billion has beenapproved but not disbursed, he said, and Argentina is in theprocess of repaying $2.4 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
