The sales tax increase that went intoeffect yesterday will, over the next several years, doenormous damage to the Golden State's economy. Propertyvalues and employment among California's most vulnerablepeople will be the hardest hit. But everyone will suffer.   As for the prize at the end of the rainbow -- that elusivestate of fiscal solvency? Unfortunately, the pot's notdestined to be brimming over with coins of gold. The fiscalcondition of California will not improve in spite of all thepain and suffering. A century and a half ago Sir Robert Peelwarned politicians that they would be thwarted in theirexpectations of higher revenues from increased taxation.There is a &quot;curve&quot; that illustrates exactly thisrelationship.</LP><TEXT>   The prospect of a tax increase may prove to have boostedCalifornia's economy during the first half of this year. If atax increase is expected in the near future, people will buynow rather than later to avoid paying the higher taxes. Theseaccelerated purchases will create an illusion of an improvedeconomy. But it is only an illusion: Not only would 1992 be abad year for California in its own right, but all thosepurchases made in the first half of 1991 in anticipation ofhigher taxes in the latter half will weaken the economy stillfurther.   California's tax increase is serious by any measure. Thestate has estimated its likely haul at $8 billion. Countiesand cities are also raising taxes. An $8 billion tax increasetakes California from the rank of 22nd most taxed state inthe nation per $1,000 of personal income, as it was in 1989,to the 9th most taxed sate. Only two states will have hadlarger percentage tax increases in the past seven years: WestVirginia and Louisiana. West Virginia's massive tax graboccurred last year, so it's still too early to track theresults. But Louisiana's happened in 1985, and the resultsare there to see.   In 1985, the first full year of Louisiana's tax increase,the state unemployment rate rose by 1.5 percentage points ata time when the national unemployment was falling by 0.4percentage points. The state's debt was downgraded that year,as well. The next year, 1986, Louisiana's unemployment raterose another 1.6 percentage points to 13.1%. The nationalunemployment fell 0.2 percentage points to 6.9%. The state'sdebt rating was again downgraded. In 1984, the year beforeLouisiana's tax increase, per-capita personal income was alittle more than 83% of the national average; by 1987, incomeper capita had slumped to less than 75% of the nationalaverage.   But California doesn't need to be cautioned by the badexamples of other states. Its own past should be guideenough. From the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s,California's taxes were way above the national average. Formost of the decade from 1967 through 1976, it ranked in thetop five highest tax rate states. On a per-capita basis,California was the second or third highest taxed state ineach and every year of that decade.   During that same 10-year period, California's unemploymentrate averaged 1.8 percentage points above the nation's.Population growth -- while higher than that of the nation asa whole -- was low for California. Housing prices, adjustedfor personal income, were below the national average and realincome per capita was falling relative to the rest of thenation.   California's boom following the tax cuts of the late-1970sis legendary. Unemployment fell below the national average,real income per capita grew, population growth acceleratedand the real estate market soared. With the tax increases of1990 and this year's proposed tax increases all of that is atrisk.   Imagine two companies in close competition with eachother. One of those companies is located in California, theother is in a neighboring state where taxes are not beingraised. Because both companies sell roughly the sameproducts, competition requires them to price their productssimilarly. They pay the same interest rates, supply costs andafter-tax wages. California's tax increase, therefore, cannotbe passed forward in higher prices or backward to suppliers.The California company has to swallow the tax increase intoto.   Rational business decisions would lead to a contraction ofthe California facilities and an expansion out-of-state. Thestock price of the California company will tend to fall.People who can move will move. People who can't move willface the prospects of higher unemployment and lower wages.These people, of course, are those with the poorestemployment skills.   Property values will be exceptionally hard hit, becausethere is nothing less mobile in the short term than property.In the long run, of course, property can move -- newfacilities can be constructed elsewhere and old ones can beallowed to wear out. This is why California's constructionindustry will be one of the hardest hit industries from 1992on.   My estimates for all these effects derived from a combinedtime series cross-section analysis of the 50 states over thepast 35 years are as follows:   -- California's real estate prices will be down from theirprevious highs by close to 20% by the end of 1994.   -- California's unemployment rate will rise -- relative tothe rest of the nation -- by more than 2.5% from June of 1990to the end of 1994.   -- California's personal income per capita -- againrelative to the rest of the nation -- will fall by a total of6% by the end of 1994.   -- California's bond ratings will be lowered.   -- California's budget will remain in crisis.
