Andropov ignored rampant corruption thatreached into the Kremlin while he headed the KGB under Leonid I.Brezhnev, a Soviet magazine said in the first direct official attackon Brezhnev's successor.   Ogonyok, a crusading weekly at the forefront of glasnost, alsoquoted an official who alleged that Andropov helped Josef Stalincarry out his bloody purges in 1949-50.   Andropov, who headed the KGB secret police from 1967-82 and thenled the country until his death in 1984, has not been directlycriticized before in the official press. Andropov was in some ways amentor of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has expandedAndropov's campaigns for honesty in government and against slacknessat the workplace.   The only previous indication that Andropov might be falling outof official favor was an announcement in March that a city would bestripped of his name. One Western diplomat said at the time theswitch indicated ``a major change in the leadership's approach toAndropov,'' even though many current top Soviet leaders stronglysympathize with Andropov.   But it is too early to tell whether the criticism of Andropovappearing in Ogonyok will lead to an official campaign to discreditthe man who turned the KGB into a modern instrument of espionageabroad and repression of dissent at home.   It could just stem from a personal grudge against Andropov by theman he replaced as KGB chief, Vladimir Y. Semichastny, the source ofthe allegations published in Ogonyok. Semichastny appeared bitterthat he was removed as KGB chief after six years of service anddemoted to a party job in the Ukraine to make way for Andropov.   Another element minimizing the criticism was that it was based onSemichastny's speculation about what Andropov should have known ordone about corruption during the Brezhnev era. He offered no proofthat Andropov ignored the corruption, saying only ``all those factsexist in archives somewhere.''   Semichastny said Andropov ``had to be aware of what was happeningin Uzbekistan,'' a reference to the widespread corruption thatplagued the republic. He also should have known about wrongdoing inthe Soviet Interior Ministry, where cronyism and bribery werereported rampant, the former KGB chief told Ogonyok.   Semichastny also implied Andropov did not tell the Kremlinleadership ``about the adventures of Brezhnev's daughter, Galina,about the gypsy, about the whole story with this family.''   Galina Brezhnev scandalized Moscow with her high-rollinglifestyle during her father's reign. The Soviet press has accusedher of speculating in diamonds, and she has been linked to a briberyscandal involving a gypsy performer for the Moscow circus.   She is married to Yuri Churbanov, a first deputy InteriorMinister fired in 1984 and sentenced in December to 12 years in alabor camp for accepting $150,000 in bribes.   Andropov kept ``silent along with the rest'' about the corruptionbecause he probably was afraid he would lose his seat on the rulingPolitburo if he came forward with the allegations, Semichastny said.He also kept quiet, Semichastny said, because he knew Brezhnev wasfriendly with Interior Minister Nikolai A. Shchelokov, who committedsuicide in December 1984 after investigators began probing hisconduct.   One of Andropov's first major personnel shakeups after coming topower was to fire Shchelokov, reputed to have amassed a collectionof Western cars and to have accepted boxes full of money and jewelsfrom Uzbek police officials.   After Andropov succeeded Brezhnev in November 1982, he crackeddown on corruption, and Semichastny acknowledged that he thenfollowed the ``right'' policy. But because he was KGB chief duringBrezhnev's rule, Andropov ``had to be responsible in his own way forwhat was happening,'' Semichastny said.   Semichastny also reviewed Andropov's early career that began inthe northern region of Karelia. He referred to Andropov's``participation in arrests'' in the region during Stalin's purges.</TEXT></DOC>
