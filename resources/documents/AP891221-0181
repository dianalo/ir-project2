In Washington, the State Department said a ``massacre ofundetermined proportions'' was believed to have taken place thelast few days. Officials said the Bush administration was preparingto reduce ties with Romania and hinted at possible sanctions.   Petar Tomic, a Yugoslav journalist in the closed country, saidan armored vehicle crushed two students, other students rushed totheir aid and security forces opened fire, killing or woundingabout 20 people. He said other people were shot down, but he didnot have a casualty count.   Clashes were reported in at least two other cities Thursday. APolish couple interviewed by Hungarian television said that in theeastern city of Arad, soldiers fired on about 3,000 demonstrators.   They said they saw some students ordered out of a college, madeto stand up against a wall and shot dead. When the alleged shootingoccurred was not clear.   American diplomats counted at least 13 people felled byautomatic weapons fire and said more were possible, according toState Department spokesman Richard Boucher.   Jonathan Lamb, first secretary at the British Embassy inBucharest, told British Broadcasting Corp. TV that two of hiscolleagues had seen the bloodied bodies of eight or nine youngpeople with head wounds, and guessed there could be many more.   ``One of my colleagues stepped over a dead body,'' he said.``Two of my colleagues have been towards another demonstration nearthe American Embassy and they have found bodies in the streets.''   He said he had ``no doubt'' security forces had fired onprotesters.   It was the first violence in the capital since hundreds,possibly thousands, of anti-Ceausescu demonstrators reportedly wereshot and killed by security forces last weekend in theTransylvanian city of Timisoara, 500 miles from Bucharest.   By 3 p.m., the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug and theBulgarian state news agency BTA said from Bucharest, firing hadstopped. Elderly people urged troops not to act against theprotesters, BTA said.   By early evening, however, Yugoslav radio and Tass reported morebursts of automatic weapons fire.   ``The streets are becoming more and more animated,'' Tass said,adding that Romanian state TV had not begun its customary broadcastat 8:00 p.m.   The demonstators ``are surrounded by Romanian army soldiers,special troops armed with truncheons and plastic shields andsecurity forces,'' Tass said. ``Choppers are patrolling over thecity.''   The Tass correspondent said he was told by a man in plainclothes, who identified himself as ``a representative of theworking people who helps to preserve order,'' that there was noloss of life.   The man said people who were seen being carried to ambulances``had no time to dine, got overexcited and fainted.''   Mass protests began after Ceausescu was shouted down whileaddressing an official rally in a downtown square in the capital,an occurrence unheard of in the nation he has treated like a feudalfiefdom for 24 years. Official media switched off live coveragewhen the jeering started.   Last weekend in Timisoara, 30 miles from the Hungarian andYugoslav borders, police and soldiers opened fire on crowdsshouting ``Bread!'' and ``Down with Ceausescu!'' Estimates ofdeaths there range from hundreds to 4,000.   Resistance to Ceausescu, who on Wednesday returned from athree-day official visit to Iran, spread to other cities inTransylvania, to Moldavia in the north and on Thursday to Bucharest.   Clashes were also reported Thursday in Arad and Cluj inTransylvania. General strikes were reported in Timisora and Arad.   Ceausescu, 71, faces his most serious challenge, with no supportand much criticism from Warsaw Pact allies whose societies arebeing transformed by a democratic tide. The downfall of the oldguard elsewhere in Eastern Europe has made Ceausescu thelongest-serving Communist ruler.   Journalists have not been admitted to Romania since the weekend,and the travel of those already in the country is severelyrestricted.   Hungarian radio said in an early evening broadcast thatprotesters chanted, ``The army is with us!'' _ indicating somesoldiers were unwilling to fire at demonstrators _ but also quotedHungarian Defense Ministry spokesman Gyoergy Keleti as sayingRomanian security forces wore military uniforms.   Yugoslav media, quoting witnesses, reported that soldiers andpolice who refused to fire on anti-government protesters inTimisoara were executed. They did not say when the executionsoccurred.   Yugoslav radio said there were unconfirmed reports of strikes infactories and that students were promoting a general strike.   Hungarian radio said the Communist Party's ruling Politburo wasmeeting in unannounced session, probably discussing the unrest.   Timisoara was reported near open revolt.   ``According to accounts coming from journalistic circles,enterprises, plants and factories aren't working in Timisoara,''Tass reported. ``They have been occupied by workers, who havewarned that if their conditions aren't met, they will blow up theseenterprises.   ``The conditions ... include a demand for the government'sresignation and a demand that party officials, military and otherleaders who allowed loss of life in the town be called to account.''   It said the workers demanded withdrawal of the army and,``according to the latest information, the military units havestarted to leave.''   A Romanian who crossed to Yugoslavia said tanks were withdrawnfrom Timisoara after workers occupying a large petrochemical plantand threatened to blow it up.   A Romanian traveler arriving in Yugoslavia said he also hadheard of protests Thursday in Craiova in the south and Suceava inthe north.   Reports of continuing trouble in Timisoara suggested Ceausescuobtained little effect by declaring a state of emergency in theregion Wednesday night that set an 11 p.m. curfew and bannedgatherings of more than five people.   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary said he had heard ofclashes ``between security forces'' and some army units and thatthere was ``a serious political movement'' against Ceausescu.   French President Francois Mitterrand said Ceausescu's days inpower ``are numbered.''   A French radio station said Romanian exiles in Rome hadannounced the desire to form a government-in-exile.   At the official rally at which Ceausescu spoke, hundreds ofpeople began to boo and jeer, and thousands more soon joined in,Tomic journalist said.   Live radio transmission was interrupted for about three minutesas the protesters approached and booed and jeered Ceausescu, whoseausterity programs and other harsh policies have imposed rationingand other hardships on his 23 million people.   Suddenly, there was a high-pitched noise on the radio, thenpatriotic music was played for about three minutes beforeCeausescu's speech resumed in midsentence. Later broadcasts of thespeech were edited to omit the jeers.   About 25 minutes after the scene at the rally, a Westerndiplomat said, street protesters could be heard chanting ``DownWith Ceausescu!'' ``Freedom!'' and ``Timisoara, Timisoara!''   Late in the afternoon, Hungarian radio said ``tens of thousandsof people'' were in the streets of Bucharest, some cutting theCommunist emblem out of the national flag after burning bannersmade for the official rally.</TEXT></DOC>
