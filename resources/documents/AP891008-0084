Abdul-Rahman Al-Atiqi, adviser to the emir of Kuwait and aformer oil and finance minister, accused the industrialized nationsof ``fraudulence'' and warned that the ``political aspect'' of debtwas being overlooked.   Atiqi addressed a symposium attended by about 400 prominenteconomists and bankers from the United States, Britain and the GulfCooperation Council, which consists of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.   Market solutions to the international debt crisis is one of thetopics being discussed at the symposium, which focuses on theimpact of globalization of markets on the GCC countries.   ``What the creditor rich countries are proposing for resolvingthe debt crisis is nothing more than fraudulence aimed at shacklingthe states of the Third World and absorbing their resources,''Atiqi said.   ``The rich countries did not grant loans to poor developingcountries out of compassionate motives, but rather for winning themas subservient states that rotate in their orbits, to becomemarkets for their goods and test fields for their weapons ofdestruction,'' he added.   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, has launchedan initiative for alleviating the indebtedness problem of the ThirdWorld, a plan Atiqi called more favorable.   The emir proposed before the U.N. General Assembly last year thewriting off interest paid by poorest countries on their debts aswell as part of the principal. He also called for an internationalconference on resolving the international debt crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
