(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rescuers crawled through collapsed homesand shops today looking for more victims of a tornado that carved a3-mile stretch of destruction, killing 17 people, injuring 463 andleaving 1,000 homeless.   ``It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in ablender and putting it on liquefy,'' said rescue worker BobCaraway, whose specialty is cave rescues. He was among those calledout to help dig through rubble for survivors or the bodies of thedead.   The tornado was one of a series that touched down Wednesday inan arc spanning at least seven states from the Deep South to theMidwest. The other tornadoes caused at least 19 injuries andfar-flung property damage.   In Huntsville, teams with cranes and floodlights searched forthe injured or dead, hampered by wind-whipped rain and temperaturesthat plummeted overnight from 73 degrees into the 30s.   Gov. Guy Hunt sent 50 National Guardsmen to help and said hewould view damage Friday. His spokesman, Terry Abbott, said aerialsurveys indicate the twister hopped along a 25-mile path, much ofit straight through Huntsville.   By this afternoon, severe thunderstorms were crossing theNortheast. The National Weather Service put out a tornado watch forparts of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York,all of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts,Vermont and New Hampshire.   In Pennsylvania, the weather service said it receivedunconfirmed reports of a tornado that turned over a car and knockeddown trees and power lines near Gettysburg.   Elsewhere:   _In Georgia, 19 people were injured, four critically, and atleast 200 people were evacuated after a tornado strus.C., and a tornadotoppled trees, downedpower lines and damaged 20 houses near Greenwood, S.C. No injurieswere reported in either state.   _Tornadoes caused minor property damage in Mississippi, Kentuckyand Indiana.   _In West Virginia, high winds believed to be tornadoes sweptJefferson County early today, overturning trailers, blowing roofsoff homes and downing power lines, authorities said. Four peoplewere injured, two seriously.   _Heavy thunderstorms destroyed at least a dozen homes inAlorton, Ill., killing one person and injuring 20 others, fiveseriously, authorities said.   The tornado struck Huntsville with virtually no warningWednesday afternoon as the city's streets grew busy with theapproach of rush hour. In a matter of seconds, cars were hurledthrough the air and crushed, and apartments and stores looked as ifthey had been bombed.   ``It was fast,'' said Lucy Lee Rusk, whose apartment wasbattered by debris. ``It was like one big pop and that's wheneverything went.''   The National Weather Service had issued a tornado watch earlierin the day, but did not issue a more urgent tornado warning until4:39 p.m. CST, when the tornado was spotted at the municipal golfcourse. By then, it was already tearing up the city.   A watch means a tornado is considered possible, while a warningmeans a tornado is believed to exist.   Huntsville Police Maj. Robert Moder said this morning that 463people were injured by the twister, which plowed through a schooland rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.   Police Chief Richard Ottman initially put the number of dead at19, but his clerk, Kitty Whitworth, later said the death toll waslowered to 17 after police confirmed the count of bodies. She saidpolice had no firm reports of people missing.   No children in the school were killed, but about 30 youngsterswere in a kindergarten class at the building, and five werereported injured. Most of the dead were in apartments, stores orcars.   Mayor Steve Hettinger estimated the number of homeless at 1,000and said officials were preparing a request for federal disasterassistance.   A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood ofthe survivors as ``shock, mostly, and disbelief.''   ``They're thankful to be alive and they're thankful theirfamilies are alive,'' he said, adding that the shelter had receivedcalls from around the country from worried relatives.   The tornado was Alabama's deadliest since a 1975 twister killed22 people in Birmingham, said Danny Cooper, state emergencymanagement director in Montgomery.   Along a highway near a destroyed apartment complex, cars wereflipped and smashed into telephone poles and crushed by trees. Theroadway was strewn with used bandages and medical gloves left byemergency workers treating the injured.   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors haddifficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.   Those in the tornado's path spoke with awe of its fury.   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, andit just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get holdof,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car.   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circusperformer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said. ``All of these heavyarcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping over thetop of us. ... It was as if you were looking into an arc-welder,they were so bright.''   Kenneth Lenhard had undergone an operation at the CrestwoodHospital on Wednesday and returned to his room about an hour beforea window in the next room blew out as the tornado passed.   ``There wasn't anything I could do, so I covered my head,''Lenhard said. ``I thought, `What the heck, I'm already half dead.'''   The downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the WaterfordSquare and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced torubble.   Kindergarteners were the only pupils left at the school by thetime the twister hit.   The city is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and theArmy's Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported fromthe space agency or weapons testing center.   At least two other tornadoes were reported in Alabama, injuringat least three people in addition to the Huntsville total.   Near Palmetto, Ga., resident Jeff Bryant said his home at theSweetbriar Mobile Home Park near Interstate 85 began to vibratewhen the twister approached.   ``Then we heard a large, loud, swirling and humming noise,'' herecalled. ``It didn't sound like a train like everybody says itdoes. I lived near a train track. It did not sound like a train. Itsounded more like a jet aircraft at very close range.''   Thomas Farr was driving on Interstate 85 when the tornado hit.``It was picking up cars and tossing them like toys off theinterstate,'' he said. ``I saw one 18-wheeler flip over. The car infront of us was flipped about 100 yards, and the guy was thrown outof his passenger window and landed 50 feet from his car.</TEXT></DOC>
