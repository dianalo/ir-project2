They also examined ways of increasing the powers of the primeminister, traditionally a Sunni Moslem, Lebanese sources said oncondition of anonymity.   Sixty-three of Parliament's 73 surviving deputies have beenmeeting in Taif since Saturday in a session removed from Lebanonbecause of a battle that began in March between Christians and aMoslem alliance led by Syrian troops.   At the United Nations in New York, Syrian Foreign MinisterFarouk al-Shara said his country would not withdraw its 40,000soldiers and claimed the military presence guarantees somestability in Lebanon.   In the General Assembly, he said Syria would help a Lebanesegovernment of ``national reconciliation to extend its authority allover the Lebanese territory, motivated by the specialSyrian-Lebanese relationship.''   In Tehran, Iran, leaders of the two main Moslem militia factionsin Lebanon, Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Nabih Berri, head ofthe Shiite militia Amal, conferred with Iran's spiritual leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said Khamenei told them:``Lebanon is an Islamic country, and control must be wrenched outof Maronite (Christian) hands.''   The trip to Tehran by Jumblatt and Berri prompted fears amongsome legislators that Iran would try to undermine their peaceefforts.   A new charter they are considering would give the Cabinet thepower to veto presidential decisions. The authority of thepresident himself, a Christian under Lebanon's 46-year-oldunwritten national covenant, would otherwise remain untouched.   Christians have dominated the government, army and judiciarysince Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943. They wereconsidered to be the majority in 1943, but Moslems now areestimated to account for 55 percent of the 4 million people.   Conference sources said the legislators were moving toward``balancing and overlapping powers'' of the president, primeminister and the Parliament speaker, who traditionally is a ShiiteMoslem.   The draft charter was put forth by an Arab League committee ofSaudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco, which has a mandate to settlethe 14-year-old civil war by the end of November.   Sources said the draft would increase the number of deputies inthe unicameral Parliament to from 99 to 128, but many legislatorsappeared to favor adding only nine seats, all for Moslems.   Ten days ago, the Arab committee succeeded in halting six monthsof bloody duels between Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aounand Syrian troops.   Syria sent troops into Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandatefrom the Arab League.   Christians want the Syrian soldiers removed, describing them asan occupation force rather than peacekeepers.   The legislators are expected to formulate the charter while inTaif but leave its ratification for another session, tentativelyplanned for Oct.21 in Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
