Fuqua HadSurgery Sept. 4For Heart Disease---By Linda WilliamsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FQA WNEWS </IN><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   J.B. Fuqua, the 69-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Fuqua Industries Inc., had surgery for heart disease Sept. 4, a procedure that hadn't been disclosed by the company.    In an affidavit submitted as part of a request to delay a court trial, Mr. Fuqua's doctor said the executive shouldn't be subjected to the stress of a trial so soon after the operation.    But the surgery wasn't disclosed to investors, according to Mr. Fuqua, because he was back on the job following the Sept. 7 Labor Day holiday.    &quot;I'm fine,&quot; said Mr. Fuqua, adding that his doctor &quot;went a little overboard&quot; in describing his condition. &quot;I think he must have wanted to impress the judge.&quot;    The chairman's doctor is noted Atlanta cardiologist J. Willis Hurst, who said in the affidavit that Mr. Fuqua &quot;should not sustain the stress and pressure a trial would hold for him.&quot; Mr. Fuqua was expected to be in the Georgia state court for at least four days in a lawsuit over whether an Atlanta man is due a finder's fee in connection with an acquisition by a company formerly controlled by Fuqua Industries. The trial was postponed until March.    According to Dr. Hurst, Mr. Fuqua was diagnosed on Sept. 2 as having &quot;serious symptoms of coronary disease.&quot; Further examination showed a severe blockage in a major artery that carries blood to the heart. The blockage required an urgent procedure called a coronary angioplasty operation during which a balloon is inserted into the damaged artery and is inflated to open the artery, Dr. Hurst said.    In a telephone interview yesterday from Florida, where he was inspecting property, Mr. Fuqua said his doctor urged him to slow down. But he said he would be in his office &quot;by 11 a.m.&quot; today to attend a board meeting of the company's Georgia Federal Bank subsidiary.    Mr. Fuqua, who has run the consumer products and services company for the past 30 years, is known for shrewd acquisitions and sales of companies. He built Fuqua into a billion-dollar conglomerate in the 1970s, but shed operations in anticipation of unfavorable trends. The company sold its petroleum distribution subsidiary before oil prices escalated and its trucking concern before deregulation caused a shakeout among interstate carriers.    Though divestitures reduced annual sales to about $420 million in 1982, from a high of nearly $2 billion in 1980, sales have since climbed to $701.2 million in 1986. Through a series of acquisitions, Fuqua has transformed itself into a consumer products and services concern, with interests in lawn and garden equipment, photofinishing and sporting goods, in addition to the thrift institution unit.    Fuqua president and chief operating officer Lawrence P. Klamon also asserted that Mr. Fuqua's condition wasn't serious enough to require disclosure. &quot;He had a health problem that was cleared up; he's functioning perfectly normally,&quot; he said. &quot;He is as cantankerous as ever.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
