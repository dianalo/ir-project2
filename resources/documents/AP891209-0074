The military said three brigadier generals and at least 12middle-grade officers would be relieved of their duties for joiningthe coup attempt, which left at least 83 dead and more than 580wounded.   In the capital, an assailant hurled a grenade into the main postoffice Saturday, killing two people and wounding 18. It was unclearif the attack was related to the coup attempt.   About 400 troops had held the Mactan Air Base at Cebu City, 350miles south of Manila, since the coup attempt began Dec. 1.   ``Mactan airport in Cebu is now back to normal operations afterthe rebel group surrendered to government troops ... thismorning,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a statement.   `This is good news for our people who have overwhelminglydemonstrated their abhorrence for the violence espoused by themutineers,'' she said, referring to Friday's demonstration inManila in support of her government.   Most of the rebel soldiers who had held the base began leavingfor Mindanao island, where they came from. The rest marched back totheir barracks inside the base, witnesses said. Loyal forces beganclearing the base of booby traps planted by mutineers.   Brig. Gen. Renato Palma, government regional military chief,refused to give details of surrender terms but said he willrecommend no charges be brought against the rebel soldiers.   ``Here in Mactan, not a single shot was fired, so they have notcaused anything ... that will call for serious repercussion,'' hesaid. ``I think that is a very good mitigating circumstance. Inother words, we did not fight.''   Participants in past coups received little or no punishment, andin one instance mutineers were let off with 30 push-ups.   Mrs. Aquino was swept into office during the February 1986``people power'' revolution that forced Ferdinand Marcos into exileafter 20 years in power.   On Friday, more than 100,000 people gathered in Manila in a showof support for Mrs. Aquino. During the rally, she hit back at herchief critic, Vice President Salvador Laurel, and said he ``cannotwait to be president. I will never give up that position to him.''   Mrs. Aquino spoke on the site where hundreds of thousands ofFilipinos filled the streets in 1986 to prevent tanks fromattacking dissident officers who had mutinied against Marcos.   The president did not mention complaints by the rebels and othercritics that she has failed to deliver on promises of socialjustice and reform.   The reported settlement showed just how far both sides softenedto end the revolt.   On Dec. 2, Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations and warned themutineers to ``surrender or die.'' But she stepped aside to allowloyal military commanders to resolve the crisis peacefully.   Before the surrender, the rebel commander, Brig. Gen. JoseCommendador, refused to abandon control of the air base, saying histroops ``have opted to die.''   The surrender of the Mactan holdouts brought to at least 1,900the number of rebels in government hands. The military estimatesabout 3,000 soldiers joined the coup attempt, and the whereaboutsof many rebels remained unclear.   Military officials said lower-ranking officers and enlisted menwould be reassigned to other units, as has generally been the caseafter previous coup attempts.   The coup attempt began when rebel forces bombed the presidentialpalace and seized several military garrisons near Manila on Dec.1.   Government forces, backed by U.S. F-4 Phantom fighter jetsflying cover, retook the garrisons. Another rebel group holding outin Manila's financial district surrendered Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
