<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-1043 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent advances in optical theory and the design and application of opticalsystems are examined in reviews and reports. Topics discussed includeinverse problems in space optics propagation; optical design and imageformation; the processing, storage, and display of holographic images;lasers and laser components; integrated and fiber optics; and opticalmeasurement techniques, metrology, inspection, and remote sensing. Considerationis given to optical and electrooptic materials, medical applications,advanced applications of lasers and laser optics, mechanical applications,nonlinear optics and optical materials, novel spectroscopic techniquesand applications, and phase conjugation and bistability.</TEXT></DOC>
