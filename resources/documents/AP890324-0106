(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Discovery, with one ofits main engines in need of repair, returned to its launch siteFriday riding piggyback atop a jumbo jet.   The Boeing 747 left Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Thursdayand arrived at the Kennedy Space Center after an overnight refuelingstop at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas.   Discovery landed at Edwards last Saturday after completing afive-day orbital mission during which its crew of five conductedvarious experiments and deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satelliteto complete a three-satellite space communications network.   Discovery is scheduled to fly again Aug. 10 on a classifiedDefense Department mission.   One of the craft's three main engines will have to be replacedbecause of a tiny combustion chamber leak discovered duringpost-flight inspection.   NASA said it did not know now whether the engine replacementwould have any impact on Discovery's launch schedule.   Other than the small leak, which had no effect on the flight,space agency officials said Discovery returned from space in bettercondition than any previous orbiter.   Meanwhile, technicians on Launch Pad 39B were continuing to groomAtlantis for the next shuttle mission, scheduled for liftoff April28. The shuttle's five-man crew is to release the $300 millionMagellan spacecraft on the start of a 15-month journey to the planetVenus.   Magellan, which is to orbit Venus and map its surface, was to beloaded into Atlantis' cargo bay on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
