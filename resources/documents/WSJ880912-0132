The plan by the two automobile producers to sell Daimler's commercial vehicles through Mitsubishi's distribution network follows the set-up of a similar venture with Mitsubishi for the import and sale of Mercedes personal cars in Japan earlier this year.    Mitsubishi will hold a majority of the new company and will appoint its president, while Daimler will participate in its management, Daimler said.    Separately, Isuzu Motors Ltd., another Japanese auto maker, has agreed with Britain's Lotus Cars Ltd. to study possible Japanese sales of a &quot;small Lotus sports car,&quot; Isuzu officials said Friday.    The study, they said, will examine the feasibility of selling the sporty vehicle being jointly developed by the companies, which are both affiliated with General Motors Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
