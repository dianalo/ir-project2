SomeWest European scenarios to the year 2000 are discussed. Beyond 2000,the interesting competition will be between gas and electricity, andmore directly between gas and nuclear energy. Aspects of trade structureand state influence on this competition are discussed. A few words aredevoted to Shell, the most influential oil company in Western Europe.The most important natural gas company in Western Europe is Ruhrgas.The level of trade will depend on a mix of commercial and noncommercialfactors. Finally some potential markets are mentioned (transportationand electricity). It would be interesting for IIASA (International Institutefor Applied Systems Analysis) to look at gas and electricity both interms of technology and in terms of institutional structure. An alliancewith electricity is what gas needs in order to become independent ofoil.</TEXT></DOC>
