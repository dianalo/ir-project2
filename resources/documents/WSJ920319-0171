Only Nomura Securities Co., the biggest of the four,expects to post a parent-company profit. Nikko Securities Co.and Yamaichi Securities Co. said they expect losses. Thefourth firm, Daiwa Securities Co., projected a loss last weekas its president resigned following a scandal involvingquestionable trading practices.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, second-tier brokerage house YamataneSecurities Co. became the latest securities firm to settleout of court a claim that it engaged in questionablestock-shuffling practices, called &quot;tobashi&quot;. Yamatane said itagreed to pay a total of 19.4 billion yen ($146 million) totwo corporate clients. Of the Big Four, only No. 2 Daiwa hasalso admitted practicing tobashi, in which securities areshifted from one account to another to conceal losses. Theother three big houses have denied engaging in tobashi.   On a pretax basis, only Yamaichi expects a loss. AlthoughJapanese companies' pretax profits are usually the mostclosely watched part of their earnings reports, the Big Fourfirms' net-income outlooks illustrate the impact of a seriesof scandals, as well as losses from trading on their ownaccounts.   With the Nikkei stock average below 20000 and falling, theestimates are a blow to investor confidence at the worstpossible time. &quot;These kinds of losses are self-perpetuating,&quot;said Alicia Ogawa, senior analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities(Japan) Inc. &quot;People hear about these kinds of losses and say`Oh my God,' and stay away from the market.&quot;   Analysts said the results will hurt the companies, but notfatally. Government regulators, whose once-cozy relationshipswith the firms were bruised by last year's loss-compensationscandals, say they have no plans to help them out.   The biggest drop was projected by Yamaichi, which forecastan unconsolidated pretax loss of 34 billion yen, comparedwith a projection in September of a 20 billion yen profit. Ayear earlier, Yamaichi posted pretax profit of 67.55 billionyen. This year's revenue is expected to fall 36% to 233billion yen from 360.18 billion yen.   Yamaichi said it will pay 28 billion yen in taxes forearlier loss-compensation payments to favored clients, andwill record losses of 10 billion yen on securities it ownsfor investment. As a result, the company expects a net lossof 52 billion yen.   Atsuo Miki, executive vice president of Yamaichi, said itwould be the first net loss for the company since September1965, when Yamaichi had to be rescued by the government. Heblamed the pretax loss partly on a 40% drop in brokerage feesas trading volume plummeted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange inthe past several months. Yamaichi expects to cut its dividendto between seven yen and 10 yen from last year's 13.5 yen, hesaid.   Only Nomura, the world's largest securities firm, expectsto be in the black after taxes for the year. The companyforecast pretax profit of 45 billion yen, down from anearlier projection of 75 billion yen, and 81% below lastyear's pretax profit of 233.53 billion yen.   Revenue is expected to be 425 billion yen, down 38% from688.32 billion yen. Unrealized losses on securities thecompany owns were expected to drag profit down to 30 billionyen. Nomura will pay about 150 million yen in taxes on losscompensation, a company official said.   Nikko projected pretax profit of 2.5 billion yen, down 97%from pretax earnings of 72.95 billion yen a year earlier. Thecompany had earlier projected pretax profit of 45 billion yenfor the period. Revenue is expected to be 285 billion yen,down 24% from 376.57 billion.   Daiwa last week projected a net loss of 43 billion yen forthis fiscal year.</TEXT></DOC>
