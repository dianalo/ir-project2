If Iraq ends attacks on Iran's ships and oil terminals, Iranian action against the U.S. escorts of Kuwaiti tankers is less likely, U.S. officials say. Though there isn't any explicit linkage, &quot;the Iraqis understand us,&quot; one official says. The U.S. view was underscored yesterday when Iran said it wouldn't fire first in the Gulf.    But some analysts worry that Iraq may try to draw the U.S. more deeply into the war by continuing air raids. And some intelligence experts fear that Iran or terrorist allies will retaliate against the U.S. no matter what Iraq does. Some strategists argue that the U.S. should strike first against Iranian anti-ship missiles, but that isn't in the cards, senior U.S. officials say.    The officials warn that any U.S. retaliation wouldn't be bound by the doctrine of &quot;proportional response&quot; as with last year's raid on Libya.    GREENSPAN FACES a possible test as Fed chief over higher interest rates.    New government estimates show the budget deficit may start rising again next year. That is &quot;a very dangerous signal,&quot; says Greenspan, who is expected to be confirmed by early August. If interest rates rise as a result, the White House may lean on the Fed chairman to ease the Fed's grip on credit for fear that higher rates will hurt the economy and GOP chances in 1988.    Greenspan insists he would reject partisan pressures, and even some Democrats seem convinced he would. Volcker's warning to keep up the anti-inflation fight adds to pressures to resist extensive easing. The new Fed chief isn't expected to face any major early decisions on the dollar or Third World debt, nor on banking deregulation, which Greenspan, unlike Volcker, supports.    MORE CONTRA AID is far from certain, despite North's popularity.    The Contras' military performance will determine whether they can win renewed U.S. aid this fall, says Democratic Rep. McCurdy, a swing vote on aid. The Nicaraguan rebels' cause is hurt by last week's reported killing of a pregnant woman and three children during an attack. Contra backers say an acceptable human-rights record is needed to win moderates' votes.    Rebel support stirred by North is widely seen as temporary. Pro-Contra House GOP Leader Michel of Peoria, Ill., gets 97 telephone calls praising the Marine, &quot;but none of them said anything about Contra aid,&quot; a spokeswoman says. Democratic Whip Coelho predicts Congress will defeat aid. White House officials concede it will be up to Reagan to win funds.    Contra backers count on another goof by Sandinista leader Ortega, whose forces once invaded Honduras before a U.S. vote.    ODD PARALLEL: Reagan's record of seven news conferences in 1986 and two so far in 1987 during the Iran-Contra furor exactly equals Nixon's in a comparable 1973-74 period. Amid the Watergate scandal, Nixon had seven news conferences in 1973 and two in 1974 before resigning in August.    BORK'S STANCE on a gay-rights issue while at the Yale Law School will be raised at his confirmation hearing to be a Supreme Court justice. When the school in 1978 expanded its rules for law firms recruiting there to bar bias based on sexual orientation, Bork, as one Yale professor puts it, argued &quot;forcefully&quot; against the change.    KEMP PRODS Bush and Dole to join in a planned September GOP debate. In a private letter, he urges their participation as &quot;a gesture of respect and consideration for Bill Buckley,&quot; the debate's host. Kemp also will unveil a new campaign video in New Hampshire next week and plans an offensive against protectionism.    SWITCH-HITTER: In Oliver North's challenge to the independent counsel law, the Washington law firm of Williams andamp; Connolly is arguing for extreme secrecy in court proceedings. The firm also represented the Washington Post in attacking court secrecy in the jury selection in the trial of Michael Deaver, indicted for perjury by another independent counsel.    WALSH IS UNDETERRED by talk of Iran-Contra presidential pardons.    The independent counsel continues to focus on possible criminal charges, including obstruction of justice. His investigators dissect the personal finances of North, Secord and others. They also increasingly delve into CIA and Justice Department involvement.    The prosecutor probably will delay some major decisions until public reaction to the Iran-Contra hearings dies down. But conservatives' urgings that Reagan pardon North and Poindexter could prompt Walsh to step up his efforts, officials familiar with the inquiry say. He is known to be stubborn.    &quot;If the facts warrant, he won't care at all&quot; whether anybody &quot;is upset with prosecutions,&quot; says one Walsh friend.    MINOR MEMOS: Trying to compliment Greenspan, Texas Sen. Gramm tells him: &quot;Your name will be etched at the bottom of that very distinguished list&quot; of Fed chairmen. . . . To give &quot;plausible credibility&quot; to Senate testimony urging a tax break for nonprofit groups, a lawyer brings along a &quot;colonel in uniform&quot; -- from the Salvation Army. . . . The Agriculture Department's Wilmer Mizell is reimbursed for a trip to the South Pacific nation of Tonga to speak, at the king's invitation, at a prayer breakfast; airline tickets for the Mizells cost $1,316. </TEXT></DOC>
