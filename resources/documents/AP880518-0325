The U.S. Commerce Department reported Taiwan's trade surpluswith the United States was $531.8 million in March, down from $1.34billion the month before.   ``That's really exciting news,'' said Lin Chien-shan, economicsprofessor at Fu Jen University.   Lin said the narrowing trade imbalance would help alleviate U.S.pressure on Taiwan to appreciate its currency against the U.S.dollar. A stronger Taiwan dollar makes the island's products lesscompetitive in the American market and helps U.S. goods sell inTaiwan.   The U.S. dollar gained slightly against the Taiwan dollar in theforeign exchange market Wednesday. The Taiwan dollar traded at28.62 per U.S. dollar, compared with the 28.61 rate maintained forthe past 14 days.   The Taiwan dollar has appreciated 39 percent since January 1986,largely under U.S. pressure.</TEXT></DOC>
