<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-1087 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study was conducted to estimate potential human exposure levels associatedwith PCB-contaminated transformer oil spills following visible tracecleanup. This exposure assessment differed in two ways from those previouslyconducted by the EPA in support of their recent Toxic Substances ControlAct (TSCA) PCB-spill-cleanup policy rule. First, PCB concentrations andassociated exposure levels were estimated for conditions representativeof visible trace cleanup at transformer oil sites. Second, the presenceof mineral oil and its effect on the environmental behavior of PCB wereconsidered. The EPA exposure assessments assumed conditions typical ofdisposal sites, rather than spill sites, and did not consider potentialPCB-mineral oil interactions. PCB volatilization was found to be themost significant loss mechanism, and dermal contact is the most significantroute of exposure. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
