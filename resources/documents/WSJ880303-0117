And if his plan succeeds, you won't have much choice.    Mr. Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications Inc., plans to launch six quarterly magazines in September, each covering a different topic such as personalities or sports. The magazines, called Special Reports, will only appear in doctor's waiting rooms -- and doctors will be asked to stock only two non-Whittle magazines.    Mr. Whittle is sure he can wipe out competing magazines in the waiting room, and he's sure advertisers will flock to him. Moreover, he is accepting only 30 ads, one in every product category, to make sure there really won't be any competition -- only one brand of pain reliever for the six magazines, for example.    &quot;What we're saying is, you buy your category and you have guarantees of no competition and a very low level of ads,&quot; Mr. Whittle says. Advertising clutter is the &quot;soft underbelly of publishing,&quot; he adds, and Whittle's new approach &quot;can be applied to every publishing field in America with similarly devastating results.&quot;    But while Mr. Whittle has been preaching his new concept with evangelical fervor, his success is far from assured. Whittle's bigger competitors are already geared up to fight back, notably Time Inc., which is considering a waiting-room plan of its own. Moreover, despite Mr. Whittle's insistence that advertiser support is strong, ad industry executives say they have reservations. Although Whittle says it will work with advertisers to create audience-measurement techniques, agencies say they can't yet verify Whittle's extremely optimistic readership projections.    Perhaps most unsettling, some industry executives wonder whether magazines created purely to attract advertisers, rather than readers, can succeed. &quot;I'm not sure a marketing-driven idea is going to win out over a consumer-driven idea,&quot; says Leo Scullin, an executive vice president at Young andamp; Rubicam, whose client Warner-Lambert Co. is considering the program.    Whittle shrugs off the criticism. Doctors see Special Reports as a &quot;a major patient-relations program,&quot; says Alan Greenberg, Whittle's vice chairman. Whittle will provide new copies every 30 days if necessary. &quot;Never again will they have old, worn, torn magazines in the office,&quot; Mr. Greenberg says. Moreover, Special Reports will include a free ad campaign promoting the American medical community, he says.    Mr. Greenberg adds that the company has market tested charging doctors between $100 and $200 a year for the Special Reports but hasn't settled on a price.    Special Reports, Mr. Whittle says, are aimed at young working mothers, and are created to take 27 minutes to read -- the average time spent in a doctor's waiting room. He says he expects to launch Special Reports initially in 15,000 doctors' offices -- family practioners, pediatricians, and obstetricians -- and increase that to 20,000 within three years. He says he has already sold almost $20 million of the first-year goal of $37 million in advertising.    Meanwhile, Whittle says its research shows that Special Reports will reach 23 million households with children. But advertisers are wary. &quot;While I like the concept, we're moving very cautiously in terms of the guarantees we need from Whittle regarding the number of doctors' offices they will be in, and traffic to those offices, and who actually reads it,&quot; says Mark McLaughlin, a vice president and associate media director for ad agency D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles.    Grey Advertising, which is evaluating Special Reports for Procter andamp; Gamble, declines comment. But Procter already advertises in Whittle publications, and is believed likely to participate in Special Reports.    Whittle also faces powerful direct attacks by its competitors. &quot;I would give my magazines to the doctors for free if I had to -- and the minute I do that, his program is diffused,&quot; says Dale Lang, chairman of the Working Woman/McCall's group, a joint venture between him and Time. &quot;We aren't going to allow anyone to move us out of the waiting room.&quot;    Time has told advertisers &quot;don't rush in -- let us see what we can do for you,&quot; says Reginald Brack, president and chief executive of the magazine group. He contends readers will be more interested in his magazines, including People and Life, than in generic publications.    Meanwhile, at Newsweek and Gruner andamp; Jahr USA Publishing, executives have asked legal counsel to look into whether Whittle is engaging in restraint of trade. Mr. Whittle says there is no restraint of trade because his magazines are only in three types of doctors' offices.    But not all publications are looking to fight fire with fire. &quot;Our view is that the initial conception and some of the proposed counteroffers are equally ill-conceived,&quot; says Claeys Bahrenburg, an executive vice president and group publisher at Hearst Magazines. &quot;Readers should be allowed to decide what they want to read.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
