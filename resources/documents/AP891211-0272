BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The longest peacetime expansion in history. Theoft-repeated phrase rings hollow in the oil patch, where theoptimism of the early '80s dissolved to depression following theOPEC-induced collapse of the energy markets.   Ditto in the Midwest, which became known as the Rust Bowl. Andon the Plains, where farmers suffered through drought andforeclosure.   And perhaps in the Northeast, where analysts now see recession.   Not everybody has enjoyed 84 straight months of Good Times.   ``Overall, when you look at the macro numbers, it looks prettygood, (but) there have been all sorts of people who havesuffered,'' said Edward Yardeni, the Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc. economist who identified the concept of a rolling recession,which strikes different spots at different times.   ``Try going into a bar in Pittsburgh in 1984, '85 or '86 andtelling the steelworkers we haven't had a recession, they'd tossyou out on your ear,'' said Yardeni.   ``If we can continue to have these rolling recessions _ knocksome sense into all of us but one at a time instead of all atonce,'' then the nation as a whole is better off, Yardeni believes.   Manufacturing had its recession in 1985, energy in 1986 andconstruction started its downturn at the end of last year, saidDonald Ratajczak, head of the Economic Forecasting Project atGeorgia State University in Atlanta.   ``But none of them did it at the same time,'' he said. ``TheSouthwest is just now starting to get its head above water, whilethe darlings of the early '80s _ the Northeast and New England, arejust beginning to slip (and) there are signs out West that theirhousing market has overdone it.''   The rolling recession churns on.   ``Many states that were winners since 1985 could turn out to belosers as the new decade begins,'' said Stephen P.A. Brown, senioreconomist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ``In some regionsthe reversal already has begun.''   The party may be over in the Northeast.   ``It already is the problem area,'' said Sara Johnson, managingeconomist for DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``TheNortheast has experienced the slowest growth among all regions.We're saying the Northeast is in a recession.''   Speculative overbuilding and weakness in the computer industryhave led to the decline, she said.   A report by financial industry consultant Alex Sheshunoffrecently warned of weakening banks in the Northeast as theoverbuilding begins to take a toll, just as it did in the Southwest.   But whatever the Northeast's problems, they won't approach theSouthwest's of the last few years.   When the 1980s opened, the Southwest was basking in expectationsof $50-a-barrel oil while the rest of the country still wasstruggling.   When Northeasterners complained about the high price of oil,Texans responded with bumper stickers saying, ``Let 'em freeze inthe dark.''   Credit was there for the asking; new office buildings sproutedlike the state's prized wildflowers. ``Dallas,'' the prime-timesoap opera, flaunted the Texas high life and became one of the mostpopular shows on television.   Then the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries beganpumping more oil and prices fell to just over $10 a barrel, too lowto be profitable in the U.S. oilfields.   Bankruptcy became common. Unemployment exceeded 10 percent. Realestate agents took second jobs as hotel night clerks. The collapsesoon dragged down the state's largest banks, forcing the federalgovernment to come to the rescue. The more loosely regulated thriftindustry, with problems exacerbated by fraud and shadowy dealing,became an embarrassment.   The long-ignored concept of diversification became dominant, andthe state began paying attention to education and industrialrecruitment, ``because if we can't rely on God's gifts, we have tocreate our own gifts,'' said economist Tom Fomby at SouthernMethodist University.   Texas successfully has turned to high technology, wooing twocomputer consortiums to the capital, Austin. Richardson, a suburbof Dallas, now bills itself as the Telecom Corridor based on thepresence of Northern Telecom's main U.S. research center, plus thecoming of large operations for MCI and Fujitsu.   While the Southwest is only now recovering, ``the Southeasthasn't taken a recession in this decade,'' Georgia State'sRatajczak said. ``Parts of the Southeast stumbled a bit ... whenmanufacturing was stumbling, but there was enough strength in thecities with the movement towards the services that overcame all themill towns shutting down.''   Although the Southeast has been in the lead, DRI's Ms. Johnsonsays it will ``slip into second behind the Pacific Southwest'' asemployment and population gains slow and defense cutbacks are feltin several states.   ``The Pacific regions have capitalized on the export boom andwill continue to do so,'' she said. ``The economy iswell-diversified with a nice mix of high tech, finance andservices. Population continues to drift toward that region.''   The Midwest, meanwhile, may be starting a comeback, saysPrudential-Bache's Yardeni.   ``One of the buzzwords of the 1980s was the Rust Bowl, thede-industrialization of America, and this was focused on theMidwest,'' Yardeni said. ``As it turned out, these forecasts of thedeath of American industry were unwarranted. It did restructure,did cut some excess capacity and by 1987 it was clear that we werecoming out of the mid-cycle industrial recession very nicely.''   Meanwhile, the prospects for agriculture have improved, helpedpartly by the recent political changes in the Communist bloc.   ``Look at all the Russians and East Europeans we're going tohave to feed,'' Yardeni said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
