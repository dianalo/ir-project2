Bush voiced clear skepticism over the practice in which a small``protective pool'' of reporters follows a president whenever heleaves the White House _ whether on official business or personalbusiness.   ``What's being protected?'' Bush asked in an inauguration-eveinterview with a group of news service reporters.   ``You mean, if something happened like I fell over and choked ata restaurant? What if I fall over and choke in the White House?You're not there.''   ``I can't pledge to be anchored down. I'd like to work out someunderstanding that the world is not going to come to a screechinghalt if you don't know that I'm eating Peking duck over inVirginia,'' Bush said.   ``You may not agree with that,'' he said. ``But I think it'ssilly to have to feel that, when the president goes out of thatthing (the White House) that serious journalists, or their editors,feel the nation's business will come to a halt if that is notreported.''   Bush as vice president has been known for venturing into publicplaces frequently _ often going to restaurants with family andfriends, dropping in a neighborhood delicatessen, shopping in supermarkets and visiting hardware stores.   This style contrasts sharply with that of President Reagan, whoseldom left the White House except with advance notice or without atravel pool of reporters in his motorcade.   ``I'm not going to give up my ability to make a decision in ahurry,'' Bush said.   He suggested that, for one thing, going around town with a largeentourage that includes reporters can make it harder to find aparking place in front of a restaurant.   Bush said if he decides at the last minute to have dinner withfriends ``at Joe's Bar or Joe's Restaurant, we've got to be able tobe flexible.''   ``And you shouldn't have to be rudely treated by standing out inthe cold wondering what the hell I've ordered in a Chineserestaurant,'' Bush said.   ``I'm not going to shake you,'' Bush added. ``But I'm not goingto feel obligated to say we can't do this for an hour because we'vegot to notify (the news media).''</TEXT></DOC>
