To Report a Deficit For the 4th Quarter </HL><SO> </SO><CO> SFCP </CO><DATELINE> SUFFIELD, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Suffield Financial Corp. said it expects to report a fourth-quarter loss of $2.3 million after charges from the sale and write-down of securities.    The bank holding company added that it expects to break even for all of 1987, after the fourth-quarter securities losses and a $1.3 million provision for loan losses during the second half.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Suffield earned $1.5 million, or 25 cents a share. In 1986, the company earned $5.9 million, or 97 cents a share.    Suffield said that its fourth-quarter loss included a pretax loss of about $1.8 million from the sale of $15.1 million of securities and a pretax loss of about $2.7 million from the write-down of certain securities in its equity portfolio. Offsetting the losses was a tax benefit of about $1.1 million from the securities transactions, Suffield said.    Suffield said that following management changes in July, it began reducing its dependence on investment profit. The company said that on a cost basis, its equity portfolio totaled 5.7% of assets at the end of 1987, compared with 11.6% of assets on Dec. 31, 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
