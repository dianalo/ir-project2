The House voted Wednesday not to take up the measure, which haspitted Sunbelt states whose populations have been swollen byillegal aliens against Frostbelt states that stand to lose Houseseats after the census.   By a 232-184 vote, the House used a parliamentary maneuversteered by Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., to keep the censusmeasure off the floor.   That vote instructed House negotiators to accept a provision inthe Senate version of the State, Justice and Commerceappropriations bill to condemn the continuation in power of Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama. The rules permit only one set ofinstructions to a conference committee.   The move blocked Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., from offering his ownset of instructions on the census question to the House members ofthe same committee.   Ridge's provisions would have ordered the House negotiators toaccept another Senate-passed provision, this one to barring the useof any money for the Census Bureau to count illegal aliens in its1990 head count.   The census bureau has always counted residents regardless ofcitizenship. Past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the counthave always died in committee.   Under current census rules, California, Florida and Texas, withmany illegal aliens, expect to gain House seats and New York,Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are among those expectedto lose seats.   ``The question is simple,'' Ridge said. ``Are people who haveentered our country illegally entitled to representation in theUnited States Congress? I say no.''   Even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to geta vote on the Ridge proposal, backers of the census change used thehour devoted to the Noriega censure to debate the census issue.   Ridge and others characterized it as a matter of politicalfairness. ``I want equal representation for American citizens,''argued Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa.   Opponents argued that any change in census rules at this pointwould cost $1 billion, including the cost of reprinting forms andretraining the census-takers. They said it was not clear counterscould even get accurate information on citizenship.   Opponents have said the Senate provision is clearlyunconstitutional, since the Constitution requires a census of``persons.'' When the Constitution wants something to apply only tocitizens, it clearly says ``citizens,'' according to this argument.</TEXT></DOC>
