WAKIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two suspended investigators of a countyprosecutor's office were on the verge of pleading guilty to asingle extortion charge nine weeks ago _ with the promise ofprobation for their sentence.   Today they face more than 50 years in prison.   U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry refused to accept theplea, saying it would violate her conscience in light of thecharges' seriousness, and the case went to trial. A federal juryFriday convicted Thomas Gilsenan and Ralph Cicalese of conspiracy,racketeering, extortion and drug charges.   The government said the Essex County investigators protected adrug dealer in exchange for cocaine, cash and valuables.   The jury largely accepted the word of the man the investigatorsprotected: convicted drug-dealer and admitted murderer RobertVidal. Vidal was the bulwark of the government's case.   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the case was difficult,and authorities felt they had less than a 50 percent chance ofvictory at the trial's outset.   ``It's always difficult to convict law enforcement officers ofcorruption,'' he said.   Alito added that the verdict opened new ``avenues'' forinvestigation, and the probe into law enforcement corruption inNewark would continue. He would not elaborate.   The defendants showed no reaction when the verdict wasannounced. From the section where family and friends were sitting,sharp gasps could be heard.   ``The word disappointment doesn't do justice to this,'' saidGilsenan's attorney, David Ruhnke. He and Michael Critchley,Cicalese's lawyer, promised appeals.   Gilsenan, 42, of Verona was a detective in the Essex Countyprosecutor's office since 1971. Cicalese, 36, of West Orange is aformer Newark police officer and worked in the investigator'soffice since 1984. Both were suspended after the indictment.   Barry set sentencing for Feb. 14. They face more than 50 yearsin prison terms.   Gilsenan and Cicalese were each found guilty of racketeeringconspiracy, racketeering and drug and extortion conspiracy.   Gilsenan was also convicted of nine individual extortion, drugand obstruction of justice counts and acquitted of 11 other counts.Cicalese was found guilty of 11 individual extortion and drugcounts and was acquitted of six others. The crimes were committedbetween 1984 and 1986.   McCarthy said that the two investigators tipped off Vidal abouta police informer in his organization, told him of wiretaps andprotected him from arrest. In exchange, he said Cicalese receivedmainly cocaine and Gilsenan got cash, appliances, a car, suits andjewelry.</TEXT></DOC>
