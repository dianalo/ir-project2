Partly in response to a Mexican effort to encouragefranchising, 20 American franchisers so far this year haveregistered to open units in Mexico -- matching the entire1989 total, says Michael Brennan, a franchising attorney inChicago. Mr. Brennan and others say the figures suggestMexico eventually could rival Europe as a foreign destinationfor U.S. firms.   Kwik Kopy Corp., a Houston franchiser of photocopyingcenters, recently signed an agreement to open 100 units inMexico over the next few years. The first is expected tostart up next month. Philadelphia's West Coast Video Inc., afranchiser of video-rental stores, is seeking a Mexicanpartner to open five units in Mexico City, with oneadditional unit to open every six weeks thereafter.   Until this year, Mexican law severely restricted thecontrol a foreign franchiser could exert over itsfranchisees. But in January the government exempted suchbusinesses from many of the old rules and granted franchisersan array of new powers.   Mexico's growing middle class and favorable economictrends and tax structure bode well for franchising in Mexico,as does a free-trade agreement that the country is expectedto reach with the U.S. by the end of 1991.   However, Mr. Brennan warns, &quot;there are still someproblems.&quot; For example, Mexican law prohibits non-competeclauses in contracts and forbids franchise agreements of anykind that run for more than 10 years.                                                                                                          Thriving Scams Aim   At Small Companies                                                                                                          INFLATABLE RAFTS have floated into the sea of smallbusiness scams.   The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles recently obtained fraudconvictions against two men who allegedly used telephoneboiler rooms to sell overpriced advertising trinkets tosmall-business owners after telling each entrepreneur that hewas the winner of a new powerboat. The only &quot;boat&quot; ever sentwas a small, inflatable raft-like vessel that arrived in acardboard box, say the prosecutors.   Telephone-marketing tricksters, mostly based in SouthernCalifornia, are still thriving despite increased efforts byauthorities, and many of their victims are entrepreneurs,says Beverly Hills lawyer David A. Katz. He's the former headof a multiagency government task force aimed at boiler-roomoperators. Many scams involve selling nonexistent oroverpriced office supplies, he says, and small businesses areparticularly vulnerable because they often order moreinformally.   In Capitol Hill testimony last month, Mr. Katz told howscamsters often develop a &quot;mooch&quot; -- a company insider bribedto order thousands of dollars of pens, pads and other items.   In another popular scam against small businesses, thecrook orders merchandise on credit, never pays and disappearswith the goods. Small-business owners should be particularlywary of new customers who make a few small orders and thensuddenly start making giant ones, experts warn.                                                                                                          Carving Out a Niche   In Employee Training                                                                                                          SMALL BUSINESSES thrive helping corporations with trainingand education.   &quot;As technology proliferates into all aspects of theworkplace, corporations are busy retraining workers,&quot; saysventure capitalist Yuval Almog of AIA Ventures, Minneapolis.&quot;Much of that work will be farmed out to small, specialistfirms.&quot; Mr. Almog says he has invested in several suchstartups.   Authorware Inc., also of Minneapolis, recently received amultimillion-dollar contract from American Airlines todevelop training tools for a broad spectrum of its employees.Using Authorware's system, for instance, pilots can evaluatethe impact on takeoff of such variables as runway length,wind velocity and aircraft weight. Northern Telecom Ltd. isworking with Authorware to develop ways to help employeesunderstand new technology.   Multimedia technology -- combining text, graphics, video,sound and animation -- &quot;provides a level of realism andsimulation that traditional training means can't,&quot; says John&quot;Bud&quot; Colligan, chief executive officer of Authorware and aformer Apple Computer executive.   Meanwhile, salesmen and clients of database developerOracle Corp. are using software of Boston's RelationalCourseware Inc. for training. Big corporations have theinternal capability to provide training and education, but&quot;smaller companies often can do the same things faster andcheaper,&quot; says John Carson, a former McKinsey andamp; Co.consultant who launched his own start-up this year to helpcorporations provide employees with parenting information.Educational Publishing, Mr. Carson's start-up, publishes anewsletter that Polaroid Corp. and Pacer Systems Inc. aredistributing to staff.   Odds and Ends                                                                                                          ENTREPRENEURS start young, says a survey of 1,000 smallbusinesses by United Group Information Services. The averageentrepreneur surveyed was about 29 years old when he or shestarted a business, and 82% took the plunge before turning40. . . . Boredom and burnout are the biggest reasonsbusiness owners cite for selling their firms, says David R.Hoods, division president of Geneva Cos., an Irvine, Calif.,merger and acquisition services firm. Lack of capital andabsence of a child who wants to take over are the nextbiggest reasons, he adds.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          YUVAL ALMOG is a partner of IAI Ventures, Minneapolis.
