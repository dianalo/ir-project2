HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A disease closely related to the AIDS viruscan almost certainly be traced back to an African monkey, which mayhave given it to people by biting them, a researcher said.   Dr. Vanessa M. Hirsch of Georgetown University said Friday theWest African epidemic of HIV-2 disease most likely comes from thesooty mangabey, a nondescript charcoal-gray monkey that is nowendangered.   The virus causes no outward signs of disease in the monkeys. Butwhen humans contract the disease, it causes a serious illness thatis similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, although lessfatal.   Hirsch said she believes HIV-2 was transmitted from monkeys topeople within the past century through a bite or some other closecontact.   HIV-2 is in the same family of viruses as HIV-1, the virusresponsible for the AIDS epidemic elsewhere in Africa as well asEurope and the United States.   Many kinds of African monkeys naturally harbor relatives of thehuman AIDS virus. And while the chances of transmission fromanimals to people are slim, this likely has happened in the pastand could occur again.   Hirsch presented her findings Friday at a meeting of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science.   Many experts believe that HIV-1 spread from animals to people,as well. According to one theory, it moved into a small,geographically isolated pocket of humans in Africa; the diseasebecame epidemic only in recent years when those people moved tocities.   ``The evidence is highly suggestive of transmission from monkeysto man of HIV-2,'' said Dr. Louis N. Martin of the Delta RegionalPrimate Research Center at Tulane University. ``But where did HIV-1come from? We don't know.''   Hirsch said there are two reasons to think that HIV-2 came fromsooty mangabeys. The monkey virus and HIV-2 are about 75 percentalike, and the monkeys live in the same area where HIV-2 is rampant.   She said the animals are quick to bite, and people in WestAfrica keep them as pets and for food.   ``I would say it's very dangerous to own any kind of Africanprimate,'' Hirsch said.   She said the sooty mangabey virus also was probably the cause ofan AIDS-like illness in macaque monkeys in the United States.Macaques are Asian monkeys and do not naturally harbor their ownrelative of the AIDS virus.   A virus known as SIV, or simian immunodeficiency virus, wasfirst isolated at the New England Regional Primate Center in 1985,and it has become an important stand-in for studying human AIDS.   Macaques that catch this virus quickly grow sick and die. Theyare now used as models to test possible ways to treat or preventAIDS in people.   For instance, researchers at the New England primate center havefound evidence that a potential medicine known as CD4, which isintended to draw the virus away from its usual targets in thebloodstream, appears to wipe out the virus in monkeys. Preliminarystudies of this approach are now being conducted in people.   Other researchers at the Delta primate center have found thatvaccines made from killed monkey virus may be effective inprotecting animals from infection with the virus. Experts say thiswork is among the most promising signs yet that an AIDS vaccine forpeople is possible.</TEXT></DOC>
