Once in thesteel, the hydrogen is capable of migrating to sites of triaxial stresses,such as those found at the tip of an advancing crack. Sufficiently highhydrogen concentration will interfere with the lattice integrity, thusenhancing fatigue crack growth rates and promoting hydrogen stress cracking.The hydrogen uptake rate is considered to be a key parameter as it givesa measure of the severity of a given exposure and allows appraisal ofpossible hydrogen assisted damage. In this paper a brief review of hydrogenevolution in connection with cathodically protected steel is presented;with measurements of hydrogen uptake in simulated and actual environmentsfully documented.</TEXT></DOC>
