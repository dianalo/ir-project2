More particularly,      it relates to improvements in apparatus of this type in which a drum      having &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; indicia therein is connected to a part which is      rotatable, in response to rotation of the closures member, within a      housing typically installed on the actuator of the valve or apparatus      installed on the valve to monitor its position and having windows through      which the indicia on the drum may be seen from locations remote from the      valve. </PAR><PAR>  As shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,494,566, the housing of      indicating apparatus of this type is of cylindrical shape which is so      installed as to permit a similarly shaped drum to rotate about the      vertical axis of a shaft connected in end to end relation with a part of      the actuator or monitor which rotates in response to rotation of the      closures member. Since the actuator is often of the type whose operator      reciprocates horizontally, and thus of generally elongate configuration,      the overall installation lacks symmetry and is thus not aesthetically      appealing. Also, if space was a problem, the indicating apparatus might      have to be down-sized to the lateral dimension or width of the actuator,      thus making its indicia difficult to see from substantial distances. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore the primary object of this invention to provide apparatus      of this type whose shape conforms generally to and is within the lateral      confines of a typically elongate actuator and which, at the same time, has      indicia which may be easily seen from greater distances. </PAR><PAR>  A more particular object is to provide such apparatus which is of simple      and inexpensive construction, and which is easily and quickly assembled. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects are accomplished, in accordance with the preferred      and illustrated embodiment of this invention, by apparatus of the type      described which comprises a housing having top, side and end walls with      windows therein and a bottom wall with an opening therethrough, and a      first bevel gear mounted on the bottom wall for rotation about a vertical      axis and having means thereon opposite the opening through the bottom wall      to permit it to be rotatably connected to a part exterior of the housing      and rotatable in response to rotation of the closure member between its      opened and closed positions. More particularly, a drum is supported by the      housing for rotation therein about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the      vertical axis of rotation of the first bevel gear and with its walls      relatively close to the corresponding walls of the housing, and a second      bevel gear is supported by the drum for rotation therewith about said      horizontal axis and engages the first bevel gear in order to rotate the      drum in response to rotation of said part, and thus permit indicia about      the drum to be seen through the windows of the housing for indicating the      opened and closed positions of the closure member. </PAR><PAR>  As illustrated, the first and second bevel gears have a one to one ratio,      and the means for indicating the opened and closed positions are spaced      apart at ninety degrees about the horizontal axis of the drum. Also, the      drum preferably includes a shaft having its ends supported by the ends of      the housing for rotation about said horizontal axis and its mid portion      rotatably supported by a bearing mounted in the housing intermediate its      ends. More particularly, the bearing includes a sleeve surrounding the      shaft and radial arms on the sleeve mounted within the housing above and      on opposite sides of the shaft, and the housing, drum and shaft are split      along their lengths to permit their assembly in end to end relation. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAR>  In the drawings, wherein like reference characters are used throughout to      indicate like parts: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of the      indicating apparatus adapted to be installed above a valve actuator or      position monitor, for connection to a part rotatable with the closure      member of the valve, as shown in broken lines, and with the drum thereof      moved to a position to indicate the valve closure member to be in its      &quot;open&quot; position; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a vertical, longitudinal section of the apparatus, on an enlarged      scale, and as seen along broken lines FIG. 2--2 of FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a view of the apparatus as seen from the right hand end thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a view of the top of the apparatus; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a view of the side of the apparatus opposite that shown in FIG.      1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of the apparatus, as seen along broken      lines 6--6 of FIG. 2; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is another cross-sectional view of the apparatus, as seen along      broken lines 7--7 of FIG. 2; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a view of a label or a strip bearing indicia and adapted to be      wrapped around each end of the drum of the apparatus in position to be      seen through the windows. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  With reference now to the details of the above described drawings, the      overall apparatus, which is indicated in its entirety by reference      character 20 in FIG. 1, comprises an elongate housing 21 having a top wall      22, front and rear side walls 23 and 24, respectively, end walls 25 and      26, and a bottom wall 27 mounted on a pedestal 28 adapted to be bolted or      otherwise secured to the top side of the valve actuator or monitor. As      shown, the housing is of generally octagonal shape in cross section,      although it may, if desired, be of generally cylindrical shape, depending      on the shape of the actuator. </PAR><PAR>  The top wall 22 has a pair of side-by-side windows 29 formed therein, each      of the front and rear side walls 23 and 24 has a pair of side by side      windows 30 and 31, respectively, formed therein, and the end walls 25 and      26 have pairs of vertically spaced windows 32A and 32B formed therein. The      bottom wall, on the other hand, has an opening 33 formed therethrough,      which, when the apparatus is installed as shown in FIG. 2, is aligned with      shaft S which is rotatable with the closure member and which extends      through the opening 33, as shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  As previously described, the overall apparatus also includes a drum 34      which, as best shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, is of generally cylindrical shape      conforming to the inner cylindrical surfaces of the housing walls. The      drum has axially spaced apart hollow sections 34A, each of which has a      recess in its outer end fitting closely over a pin 35 extending inwardly      from the opposite end walls 25 and 26 of the housing so as to support the      drum sections for rotation about a horizontal axis concentric to the      housing. More particularly, the recesses are formed in stubs or bosses 36      extending inwardly from the end walls of the drum and connected to and      having shafts 37 extending from their inner ends for driving connection      with one another within a bearing 38 mounting within the housing 21      intermediate its ends. </PAR><PAR>  The housing is made up of longitudinally split sections which fit closely      about the drum sections, and a first bevel gear 41 is mounted by a washer      42 on the lower wall of the housing opposite opening 33 and in position to      engage the rotatable shaft S extending upwardly from the actuator or      monitor and for rotation about its vertical axis perpendicular to the      horizontal axis of rotation of the drum. Thus, as best shown in FIG. 2,      the washer 41 has a central opening therethrough aligned with an opening      in the gear 41 to receive the upper end of the shaft therethrough for      connection to the gear, and a second bevel gear 40 is carried about and      rotatable with the shaft 37 on the right hand section 34A of the drum in      order to rotate the shaft about the axis of rotation of the drum. </PAR><PAR>  As shown, the bevel gears 40 and 41 have the same tooth diameter, and thus      have a one to one relation so as to rotate the housing one rotation for      each rotation of the shaft S. Putting it another way, the drum is rotated      90.degree. in response to a 90.degree. rotation of the closure member      between its opened and closed positions. </PAR><PAR>  As also shown, the bearing 38 has a central sleeve 45 which closely      surrounds and thus supports the shaft 37 for rotation about its horizontal      axis. The bearing also has arms 46 which extend radially from the top and      sides of the sleeve 45 for fitting at their outer ends within slots in the      inner wall of the housing to hold the bearing against rotation with      respect to the housing. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 7, the lower arms 46 and      sleeve 45 of the bearing are placed above the bevel gear 41 as to not      interfere therewith. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 8, the label 50 Which is adapted to be disposed about each      end of the drum section has three pairs of &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; indicia      thereon spaced 90.degree. from one another, such that the indicia will      appear in the respective windows in the top and sides of the housing in      the opened or closed position of the closure member. Thus, the indicia 51A      and 51B are adapted to be alternately moved into positions opposite the      windows 31 in the rear side wall 24 of the housing, depending, of course,      upon the position of the closure member. For example, with the closure      member in its open position, the &quot;open&quot; indicia 51A appear opposite the      windows 31 while the &quot;closed&quot; indicia 51B arranged at 90.degree. from      indicia 51A are opposite a solid portion of the housing intermediate the      windows 29 and 31. </PAR><PAR>  The indicia 52A and 52B, on the other hand, which are also arranged at      90.degree. from one another, are, in the open position to the closure      member, disposed with the &quot;open&quot; indicia 52A opposite the windows 29 in      the top wall and the &quot;closed&quot; indicia 52B opposite a solid portion of the      front side of the housing beneath the windows 30. The indicia 53A and 53B,      which are also spaced apart 90.degree. are adapted to alternately appear      within the windows 30 on the front side 23 of the housing depending on the      position of the closure member. Thus, with the closure member opened,      &quot;open&quot; indicia 53A is opposite the windows 30, while the &quot;closed&quot; indicia      53B is opposite a solid portion of the front side wall of the housing near      its lower side. </PAR><PAR>  As the drum rotates 90.degree. in a counterclockwise direction (FIG. 6), in      response to closing of the valve, &quot;closed&quot; indicia 52B moves 90.degree. to      a position opposite the window 29, while the &quot;open&quot; indicia 52A moves into      a position opposite a solid portion of the housing just above the window      31. At the same time, the &quot;closed&quot; indicia 51B moves into positions      opposite windows 31, while the &quot;open&quot; indicia 51B moves opposite a solid      portion of the bottom wall of the housing intermediate windows 30 and 31.      Still further, &quot;closed&quot; indicia 53B moves into positions opposite windows      30, while the &quot;open&quot; indicia 53A moves opposite a solid portion of the top      wall of the housing intermediate windows 29 and 30. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, indicia 54A and 54B are placed on the ends of      the drum sections for alternate disposal opposite the windows 32A and 32B      in the end walls of the housing. Thus, as shown, &quot;open&quot; indicia 54A is      opposite the windows 32A in the open position of the valve, while &quot;closed&quot;      indicia 54B is opposite the intervening solid portions of the side walls.      These are of course reverse as the drum rotates 90.degree. in response to      movement of the valve to its open position. </PAR><PAR>  In order to assemble the apparatus, the right-hand housing section 30 may      be moved over drum section 34B, and gear 40 assembled over the end of      shaft 37 of drum section 34B. Bearing 38 may then be assembled over the      right-hand shaft section, and the left-hand housing section assembled over      drum section 34A. Prior to movement of housing and drum sections including      their shaft sections 37 into end-to-end relation, and following rotational      adjustment of the right-hand drum to coordinate its indicia, with the      housing windows, gear 41 is moved into place and held therein by washer      42. Upon assembly of the housing and drum sections, the washer is secured      by welding or otherwise within hole 33 formed by the housing sections. For      complete assembly, the housing sections are secured to one another, end to      end. </PAR><PAR>  From the foregoing it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted      to attain all of the ends and objects hereinabove set forth, together with      other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the      apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of      utility and may be employed without reference to other features and      subcombinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the      claims. </PAR><PAR>  As many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing      from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set      forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as      illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
