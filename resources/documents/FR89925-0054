This actionwill not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment or productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets and, therefore, has been determined to be ``not major.'' This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment. The reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507 <T3>et seq.</T3>) contained in this rule have been approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under clearance number 0572-0062. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 0.9 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Departmentof Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250;and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project(OMB 0572-0062), Washington, DC 20503. This program is listed in the catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985), thisprogram is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Background: Currently, the policies and requirements for construction of major outsideplant facilities by the force account method, construction by work orderand administration of construction certification programs by REA telephoneborrowers with REA loan funds are contained in numerous REA publicationsincluding the following existing REA Bulletins:<ITAG tagnum="26">320-23 Construction Certification Procedures for Designated TelephoneBorrowers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">381-7 Methods of Construction of Telephone Borrowers' Initial SystemOutside Plant Facilities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">382-1 Force Account Construction, Telephone Borrowers' Initial Systems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">382-2 Construction of Telephone System Improvements and Extensionsby Work Order or Contract. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">382-3 Final Inventory Documents, Force Account Construction, TelephoneBorrowers' Initial System.</ITAG>Many of these are outdated and contain conflicting information. It is necessaryto consolidate the information and make it available to the public by publishingit in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The Bulletins listed above contain certain policies, requirements, andprocedures that will be incorporated into other CFR parts. When that isaccomplished, these Bulletins will be rescinded. Presently construction is classified as ``initial system'' or ``improvementsand extensions.'' These classifications have not been well defined andcause controversy as to the method of construction to be used. The proposedrule classifies construction as ``major'' or ``minor'' depending on theestimated cost of the construction project, major being over $100,000 andminor being $100,000 or less, labor and materials. The policies, requirements, and procedures for outside plant major constructionby the force account method (borrower providing all labor and materials)are set forth in proposed subpart E. Outside Plant Major Construction byForce Account. The basic policies are (1) REA approval is required to usethe force account method of construction, (2) REA will not approve theforce account method for first time borrowers, except in very unusual cases.(3) Force Account Proposals (FAP) are subject to REA review and approvaland (4) REA will provide loan funds only up to the amount determined bythe completed assembly units priced at the unit costs in the approved FAP.The subpart also sets forth the requirements for the request to use theforce account method, the qualifications the construction supervisor mustmeet and the procedures to be followed for the construction and closeoutof the FAP. The policies, requirements and procedures for minor construction are setforth in proposed Subpart G, Minor Construction. The basic policies are(1) minor construction may be performed by contract or by work order (borrowerproviding all labor and materials), (2) minor construction activities willbe administered under the borrower's regular work order procedure, (3)the completed construction shall be inspected and certified by an experiencedlicensed telephone engineer or the borrower s staff engineer approved byREA as the ``employee in charge'' of force account engineering for allborrowers with 2,000 or more subscribers, and (4) REA will fund minor constructionwork projects only within one year of the construction completion date.The policies, requirements and procedures for the construction certificationprogram are set forth in proposed Subpart H, Construction CertificationProgram. The basic policies are (1) certain borrowers will be nominatedby REA during the loan processing period to participate in the constructioncertification program, (2) borrowers who accept will fulfill the responsibilitiesfor administration and construction of projects financed by REA loans orloan guarantees, such as, approval of engineering and architectural contracts,approval of Pandamp;S (plans and specifications), approval of price quotationsand bids, approval of construction contracts and amendments, approval ofFAP's (following REA approval of the force account method), inspectionand certification of construction, approval of closeout documents and otherresponsibilities as may be specifically granted in writing by REA, and(3) REA will retain all other responsibilities; such as, approval to deviatefrom REA requirements, except as provided in (2) above, approval of constructionprojects or amounts not included in the loan, approval of force accountmethods of engineering and construction, approval to make significant deviationsfrom an approved work plan, approval of interim construction, approvalto use materials not listed in the List of Materials Acceptable for  Useon Telephone Systems of REA Borrowers, approval of field trials, approvalto modify or alter standard forms and contracts, approval to open bidswhen fewer than the required number have been received, approval of outsideplant layouts. ``Buy American'' determinations and other responsibilitiesnot specifically transferred in writing by REA. Borrowers accepting theconstruction certification program must appoint (1) a ``Certifying Officer''to execute binding agreements, (2) a ``Construction Certifier'' to certifythat the construction complies with all technical and code requirements,and (3) a ``Certification Coordinator'' to administer the certificationprogram and serve as the official point of contact for REA. The constructioncertifier must be an experienced licensed telephone engineer or the borrower'sstaff engineer approved by REA as the ``employee in charge'' of force accountengineering. The certifying officer or construction certifier may alsoserve as the certification coordinator. This proposed rule eliminates some reporting requirements and streamlinesothers, reducing the borrowers' burden, while permitting REA to maintainthe security of the Government's loans. These subparts supersede any sections of REA Bulletins with which theyare in conflict. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1765 </ITAG>Loan programs_communications, Telecommunications, Telephone.Therefore, REA proposes to amend 7 CFR chapter XVII as follows: 1.

Compensationmay be based upon unit prices, hourly rates or another mutually agreeablebasis. Each contractor shall have only one contract per project. A singlework project may require more than one contractor. (b) The borrower shall prepare the contract form and attach any diagrams,sketches and tabulations necessary to specify clearly the work to be performedand who shall provide which materials. Neither the selection of the contractornor the contract requires REA approval. (c) Borrowers are urged to obtain quotations from several contractors beforeentering into a contract to be assured of obtaining the lowest cost. Theborrower must ensure that the contractor selected meets all Federal andState licensing and bonding requirements, and that the contractor maintainsthe insurance coverage required by the contract for the duration of thework.
