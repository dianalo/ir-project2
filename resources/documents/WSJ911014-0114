Now, they assemble for a different purpose, toworship the gods of high technology.   Over the last week government ministers and princes ofindustry from all around the globe have come here to Telecom'91, the greatest show on earth for Communications Agehardware. What they see is equipment that not only isadvanced but affordable, which means the communicationsrevolution soon will spread to millions more people, makingthem richer, freer and better informed.</LP><TEXT>   Among the glittering displays at the Palais de Expositionsare the world's latest developments in satellite, cellular,digital and fiber optic technology. With such equipment,places with inadequate or nonexistent phone systems can makeup lost ground quickly and at less cost than was possibleonly a few years ago.   William L. Weiss, CEO of Chicago's Ameritech, explainsthat cellular systems can be set up in far less time and atmuch less cost than the land-line systems that serve most ofthe developed world. Ameritech, which has branched outglobally from its main business running Bell systems in theU.S. Midwest, has just signed a contract to provide acellular system to Poland.   Jean Jipguep, deputy secretary-general of the UN-sponsoredInternational Telecommunications Union, struck an optimisticnote in an introduction to a Telecom economic symposium: &quot;Theaccelerated pace of technological advance has made itpossible for most developing countries to `leap frog' thedevelopment of their telecommunications networks.&quot;   There is plenty of evidence of that. Faris Gaffney, a vicepresident of Scientific Atlanta, notes that the cost of anearth station with 25 voice channels, capable of providingsatellite access to a fair-sized local phone system, hasdropped dramatically in the last five years, to only $150,000from $500,000. Scientific Atlanta last week signed a $12million contract with Papua New Guinea to provide 18 earthstations giving even the remotest areas of the country accessto telephone, data and television services. Four of thestations are transportable, designed for airlifting byhelicopter to rural areas on an as-needed basis. All stationswill communicate through Palapa, a satellite owned byIndonesia, which also is greatly expanding the communicationsinfrastructure stretching across its 3,000 miles of islands.   Ed Mattix, a spokesman for US West, another Baby Bell goneglobal, says it takes only about seven months to install acellular system, whereas a land-line system of the same sizemight take 10 to 20 years. A cellular system installed by USWest has just given St. Petersburg (Leningrad) a new link tothe communications networks of the outside world through a&quot;gateway&quot; in Finland. US West will soon be setting upgateways in the former Soviet republics themselves, inMoscow, Leningrad and Kiev. Right now there is only onegateway, with only 1,200 circuits, serving the entire SovietUnion, which explains why western business people sometimesgo mad waiting to get a line from Moscow back to their homeoffices. The US West project will provide Moscow with 15,000additional circuits and St. Petersburg and Kiev with 4,000each.   The absence of an adequate communications infrastructurein the former Communist lands is not accidental. It's a loteasier to run a totalitarian state if ordinary citizens can'tcommunicate by phone. At a mid-1990 conference in Prague ofleaders of anti-Communist movements in the Soviet Union,veteran U.S. political analyst Albert Wohlstetter delivered apaper entitled, &quot;The Fax Shall Make You Free.&quot; In it he saidthat dissidents in the Soviet Union had &quot;used the explosivegrowth in western information technology to end the isolationwhich had made resistance seem hopeless.&quot; In the West, hesaid, personal computers, laptops, modems, Fax machines,copiers, satellites and flexible packet networks &quot;have beenbeen the most powerful engine driving innovation and economicgrowth, creating world markets and reducing the costs anduncertainties of innumerable widely separate transactions. Inthe East, the same technologies have enabled dissidents toescape Big Brother's clutches.&quot;   Before the break-up of the Soviet Union began, one suchdissident gave me a phone number in Helsinki for reaching hisoffice in Tallinn, Estonia, where he was representing theEstonian government's drive for independence. The Estonianshad set up a cellular link with Helsinki to enable them tototally bypass the Soviet phone system.   But now the emphasis in post-Communist Central Europe andthe separatist former Soviet republics is on opening upcommunications, which is vital to the establishment of modernmarket economies. Their current problem was made evident tome last spring when I visited Sofia, Bulgaria. Ivan Kostov,finance minister of the interim government, told me that thelack of communications infrastructure was a major barrier toinstalling even the simplest banking system. Electronic fundtransfers were impossible, so managers and bankers were stillhauling currencies for payrolls and transactions around thecountry in suitcases.   While Telecom was underway in Geneva last week, a &quot;WorldCommunications Forum&quot; was being held in Crans-Montana,Switzerland, attracting some of the people who would visitTelecom. Andrew Lippman, a communications specialist fromMassachusetts Institute of Technology, told the audience thattheoretically, at least, the countries that are just nowbuilding a communications infrastructure could improveenormously on past practices.   &quot;In the United States we built our communications systemsupside down, using airwaves for TV and wires for telephones,whereas it should be the other way around.&quot; The airwaves arebetter suited to types of communication that do not require ahigh level of quality, whereas wires -- fiber optic lines inparticular -- are better suited to demanding uses. ProfessorLippman says he would like to believe that new systems willget it right, but old habits die hard.   Yet the adoption of cellular systems as quick fixes forunder-served countries -- not to mention the advent of cableTV in the developed world -- points toward what ProfessorLippman suggests. The capacity of cellular systems is limitedby wave bands but digital technology is overcoming some ofthis limitation by making more efficient use of bands.Digital technology also offers the promise of a future inwhich TV broadcasting throughout the world will becompatible, rather than divided among three differentsystems, Professor Lippman notes.   Whatever the future, the princes and potentates who showedup at Telecom '91 will not go home disappointed. In bothdepth and scope, the Communications Age has only just begun.</TEXT></DOC>
