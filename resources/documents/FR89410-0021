Areas eligible for assistance mustbe within the 17 Reclamation States, in an area for which the Governorof the State has declared a drought emergency, and in an area eligiblefor Federal disaster relief assistance under applicable rules and regulationspromulgated by the Department of Agriculture. A Presidential declarationof emergency under regulations promulgated by the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency is not required. Included in the program are short-term actionsto mitigate losses and damages resulting from the drought conditions of1987, 1988, and 1989. Under the program, funds will be provided for loansto purchase and transport emergency water supplies and support managementand conservation activities; water transfers will be facilitated betweenwilling buyers and sellers; and construction, management, and conservationactivities will be undertaken by the Secretary of the Interior. Studiesto determine augmentation, use, and conservation of water supplies willbe performed at Federal reclamation projects and Indian water resourcedevelopments.Activities undertaken by Reclamation are classified as reimbursable (requiringrepayment) or non-reimbursable (repayment not required) in accordance withapplicable Reclamation law. Actions under this rule are therefore classifiedreimbursable or non-reimbursable accordingly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2><T3>Effective Date: </T3>April 10, 1989.<T3>Written Comments: </T3>Reclamation will accept written comments onthis rule until 5 p.m. mountain time on May 10, 1989.<T3>Public Hearings:</T3> Reclamation does not plan to hold public hearingson this rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2><T3>Written Comments:</T3> Hand deliver to the Bureau of Reclamation, ProjectServices Division, Room 690, Building 67, Denver Federal Center, Denver,CO; or mail to the Bureau of Reclamation, Project Operation Services, P.O.Box 25007, Denver, CO 80225-0007.<T3>Public Hearings:</T3> Reclamation does not plan to hold public hearingson this rule.<T3>Requests for Public Hearings:</T3> Submit orally or in writing to theperson and address specified under <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.''</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Tom Phillips, Project OperationServices, Bureau of Reclamation, P.O.

Background</ITAG>President Reagan signed the Disaster Assistance Act on August 11, 1988,providing temporary authority to the Secretary of the Interior to facilitateemergency actions for the mitigation of impacts resulting from the droughtconditions of 1987, 1988, and 1989. The Act provides authority for appropriationsof up to $25 million for construction, management, and conservation activitiesand for loans to water users for management, conservation, or the acquisitionand transportation of water. The Act requires that the Secretary must expectactions implemented under the Act to mitigate losses, or expected losses,and damages resulting from the drought conditions of 1987, 1988, and 1989.The Act authorizes several types of disaster relief activities by the Secretary.Section 412(1) authorizes the Secretary to update studies and to undertakeconstruction, management and conservation activities. Section 412(2) authorizesthe Secretary to facilitate the transfer of water between willing buyersand willing sellers in the redistribution of supplies. Section 413 of theAct authorizes the Secretary to make available excess water or canal capacityon a temporary basis. Water may also be made available for fish and wildlifepurposes under section 413(c). Section 414 provides authority for the Secretaryto make loans to water users for management and conservation activitiesor for acquiring or transporting water. Authority for each of the activitiesexpires on December 31, 1989.In order to implement Title IV, Subtitle B of the Act, Reclamation hasdecided to adopt an interim rule, and simultaneously request comments fromthe public. An interim rule effective immediately is necessary in orderfor the Bureau of Reclamation to take action to ameliorate problems resultingfrom the drought and to immediately provide guidance to those who seekassistance from the Secretary under the Drought Assistance Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Commenting Procedures</ITAG>Written CommentsWritten comments submitted on the proposed rules should be specific, shouldbe confined to issues pertinent to the proposed rules, and should explainthe reason for any recommended change. Where practicable, commenters shouldsubmit five copies of their comments (see <T2>``ADDRESSES</T2>''). Comments received after the close of the commentperiod (see <T2>``DATES'') </T2>may not be considered or included in the AdministrativeRecord.Public HearingsReclamation does not plan to hold public hearings on this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Rules Adopted</ITAG>These rules outline the terms and conditions under which the Secretarywill implement Subtitle B of Title IV of the Disaster Assistance Act of1988.These rules add a new Part 423 to Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations.Because of the emergency created by the drought, these rules are effectiveimmediately, but do make provisions for public comment.Section 423.1 entitled ``General'' provides an overview of Part 423.Section 423.2 describes the information collection requirements.Section 423.3 defines several terms used throughout the regulations.Section 423.4 limits the applicability of the Department of the Interior'swater related assistance programs to the 17 States served by the Bureauof Reclamation. In order to be eligible for drought relief from the Departmentof the Interior, an area must have been declared eligible for disasterrelief under the rules adopted by the Department of Agriculture. <T3>The Bureau of Reclamation may not provide assistance until funds havebeen appropriated or otherwise made available</T3>.Section 423.5 provides an overview of the Bureau of Reclamation's disasterrelief programs. Under guidelines approved by Reclamation's Commissioner,Regional Offices will have primary responsibility for decision-making underthe Act. Each Region will establish procedures for evaluating proposals.Expenditures under section 412(b)(b) will be reviewed by each RegionalDirector to determine the extent of reimbursability. Reimbursable expenseswill be repaid in accordance with existing Bureau of Reclamation practices.Section 423.6 provides procedures for facilitating transfers between willingbuyers and sellers of water. Reclamation's Regional Directors will compilea list of willing sellers and interested buyers in the region and willconsult with State and local water agencies in the prioritization of watertransfers. Interested buyers and sellers of water should contact the appropriateRegional Director to be included on the appropriate list.Section 423.7 provides procedures for the Secretary to make available,by contract, water or canal capacity at existing Federal Reclamation projectsto water users and others on a temporary basis. This water or conveyancecapacity will be made available based on need as determined by the Secretary.Applications can be sent to the appropriate regional office of the Bureauof Reclamation. Information requested in the application includes datarelated to water or conveyance needs and uses, financial information, andother relevant supporting data or justification.Section 423.8 provides procedures for the emergency loan program. Underthe emergency loan program, a contracting entity will be eligible to obtaina loan to improve the water supply situation through activities which (1)Provide new or different water management strategies; (2) produce waterconservation plans or water conservation techniques; and/or (3) permitthe purchase of a water supply and the means to transport that water supply.The loan may also cover increased energy pumping costs to provide a watersupply. Construction activities are not permitted under the emergency loanprogram. The contracting entity should make application to the appropriateRegional Director. A contract for repayment of the loan will be required,and loans will be for a minimum of 5 years and not more than 10 years.Requests will be handled on a first-come first-served basis. All activitiesunder the emergency loan program shall be completed not later than December31, 1989.Section 423.9 provides procedures for providing water to mitigate pastlosses to fish and wildlife resources and help prevent future losses thatoccur as a result of drought conditions.Water may be made available to State, Federal, local or private entitiesbased upon identification of the resource to be protected or mitigated,the magnitude of such protection or mitigation, the level and extent ofcoordination with State and local officials, the source and quantitiesof the water proposed to be used, justification of the reasonableness ofthe proposed action, and any other relevant information deemed necessaryby Reclamation concerning the proposed action.The Act specifically authorizes the Secretary to (a) make available, atthe current contract rate, unallocated carryover storage in the New MelonesUnit, Central Valley Project, California, to the Oakdale and South SanJoaquin Irrigation Districts and (b) install a temperature control curtainas a demonstration project at Shasta Dam, Central Valley Project, California,at a cost not to exceed $5,500,000. The demonstration project is to determinethe effectiveness of the action in controlling water release temperaturesfor the purpose of protecting and enhancing the anadramous fisheries inthe Sacramento River and San Francisco/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta andEstuary. The cost of this demonstration project is to be reimbursed byCentral Valley Project water and power users.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
