Acknowledging that the ruling could encourage otherborrowers who received loans fraudulently to seekbankruptcy-court protection, U.S. District Judge SidneyFitzwater said the problem had to be remedied by Congress,and not the courts.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Fitzwater overturned an April 1990 ruling by aDallas bankruptcy judge who refused to reduce the liabilitiesof two borrowers for loans they fraudulently obtained fromthe failed Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association in Dallas. Theborrowers had argued in court that Vernon Savings officersknew that the loan proceeds wouldn't be used for their statedpurposes.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is pursuingVernon Savings' debtors, sought the full repayment of theloans. But Judge Fitzwater ruled that the agency couldn'tobject to the borrowers' release from liability in bankruptcycourt because the FDIC wasn't the initial lender and hadtherefore not relied on the borrowers' fraudulent statements.   The ruling was a rare rebuff of the FDIC's ever-expandinguse of a 1942 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, D'Oench, Duhme andamp; Co.vs. FDIC, that prohibited borrowers from asserting that sideagreements with lenders, whether written or oral, modifiedtheir liability for loans. The D'Oench Duhme doctrine, as itis known, is widely interpreted as giving the FDIC and otherregulators of financial institutions the ability to quash anyevidence outside of written loan documents, which istypically all that is available to bank and thrift examiners.   The doctrine has been exercised extensively in recentyears as the FDIC and other agencies have pursued borrowerswhose unpaid loans contributed to the widespread failures offinancial institutions. It has been particularly important tothe FDIC in cases, such as the one involving the two VernonSavings borrowers, in which the lender knowingly participatedin the fraud.   But Judge Fitzwater ruled that the FDIC couldn't use theD'Oench Duhme doctrine to sidestep the bankruptcy-lawrequirement that a creditor has to show that it relied on afraudulent statement when it extended credit.   As a result, Judge Fitzwater said borrowers James W. SmithII and Vernon S. Smith Jr. couldn't be forced to repay $2.6million in loans obtained from Vernon Savings.   FDIC lawyers said they asked Judge Fitzwater to reconsiderhis ruling and will decide whether to appeal after hisdecision.   FDIC vs. James W. Smith II, CA3-902488-D, U.S. DistrictCourt, Dallas.   ---   FORMER EMPLOYEES of a failed thrift will get theirpensions.   In the settlement of a suit against former CenTrustSavings Bank Chairman David L. Paul, nearly 2,000participants in the Miami-based bank's 401 (k) pension planwill receive a total of $1,687,500.   Filed in federal court in Miami last May, the suit chargedthat Mr. Paul, a trustee of the plan, had imprudentlyinvested all of the plan's assets in highly speculativeCenTrust securities. The suit also named as defendants thebank's lawyers, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, Garrison ofNew York; Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., a unit of Bear Stearns Cos.and one of the bank's underwriters; and other trustees of theplan.   Barry D. Hunter, a partner in the Miami law firm Paul,Landy, Beiley andamp; Harper that represents the former employees,said the case was the only one stemming from Centrust'sfailure in which damages were covered by an insurance policy.&quot;As a result of this, they {the pension plan participants}are not only going to have their losses made up, but theywill make about 15% on their investment,&quot; he said. The policywas issued by Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., Mr. Hunter said.   Mr. Paul's attorney, Guy B. Bailey Jr. of Bailey, Hunt,Jones andamp; Busto in Miami, said he strongly recommended againsta settlement. &quot;There was no merit to the case,&quot; he said. &quot;Iam very confident that if that case had gone to trial, wewould have won it.&quot; He said the insurance company made &quot;aneconomic decision&quot; to settle.   Attorneys for Paul Weiss and Bear Stearns couldn'timmediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for Aetna hadno immediate comment.   CenTrust, which invested heavily in junk bonds, was shutdown by federal regulators last year. Its failure couldeventually cost taxpayers $2 billion.   ---   FORMER UMPIRE sues professional baseball for sexdiscrimination.   Pamela Postema, who three years ago was believed to have ashot at becoming the major leagues' first female umpire,filed the suit in federal court in Manhattan. Ms. Postema wasan umpire with minor league professional baseball for 13years until she was fired in November 1989 after a negativeperformance evaluation.   Ms. Postema, of San Clemente, Calif., alleged in the suitthat &quot;a longstanding prejudice against women&quot; is the onlyreason that she and other women have not been able to breakinto the major leagues. The suit also accused the leagues oftolerating and even encouraging a work environment in whichwomen were subjected to frequent sexual harassment, such asbeing kissed by male managers.   She said in the suit that less qualified males were hiredand promoted ahead of her. The suit asks the court to orderthe major leagues to hire her as an umpire and to payunspecified damages.   Spokesmen for the minor and major leagues said they hadn'tseen the suit and couldn't comment.   ---   PALESTINIANS FILE wrongful death suit against tear gasmakers.   In a suit filed in U.S. district court in Pittsburgh,eight West Bank Palestinians sought damages from Saltsburg,Pa.-based Federal Laboratories Inc. They claimed theirspouses were negligently killed by tear gas made by FederalLaboratories.   The Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York-basedpublic interest law firm representing the Palestinians, wasable to file the suit in Pennsylvania because the state'swrongful death statute doesn't limit who can sue, accordingto Jennifer Green, an attorney at the center.   The plaintiffs charged that Federal Laboratories and itsparent, TransTechnology Corp. of Sherman Oaks, Calif.,negligently sold tear gas to Israel knowing it would bemisused. Similar negligence suits against handgunmanufacturers have succeeded in Louisiana and Maryland statecourts, said Harvard law professor Morton Horwitz.   The plaintiffs also alleged that Federal Laboratories'tear gas, called CS gas, is defective and dangerous even whenused as intended. Such an argument, if successful, couldaffect all tear gas makers.   Bob Tunno, president of Federal Laboratories' tear gasdivision, said the company couldn't comment until it saw thecomplaint.</TEXT></DOC>
