Tree seedlings planted this spring, intended for harvest in 1996, are being scorched by the drought. Foresters estimate that millions have been killed in Michigan and Wisconsin alone. &quot;This year, there will be plenty of Christmas trees,&quot; says Frank Evans, a Christmas-tree farmer in Decatur, Ill. &quot;Shortages could show up in 1996.&quot;    The drought is beginning to affect many people in many places. Besides singeing crops, lawns and city parks, it is hurting businesses as diverse as tourism and farm-equipment sales; and it has cost country singer Kenny Rogers a gig. Read on.    FOOD PRICES: For many foods, grocery prices are already rising. General Mills Inc. has raised prices 4% on its Gold Medal flour and 5% on its cereals. Pillsbury Co. is raising the tab -- it won't say by how much -- for canned peas, sweet corn and green beans. &quot;It's probably the smallest pea crop we've had in 25 years,&quot; a spokesman says.    Several economists are raising their food-inflation forecasts. Georgia State University's economic-forecasting center expects 1989 food inflation of 7%. Before the three-month-old drought, many economists expected food prices to rise only 4% this year and in 1989.    BEER: Though there is enough barley to make beer, it might not be as rich and full-bodied as usual, says Jerry Steinman, the publisher of a beer-industry newsletter. Another concern, at least for the beer industry: If the weather stays too hot for too long, people may drink less beer. &quot;When it stays hot, people don't go on picnics,&quot; Mr. Steinman says. &quot;They become lethargic.&quot;    YUPPIE CUISINE: Some restaurants that tout fresh foods are considering shrinking portions or going back to frozen or canned vegetables. &quot;What else can you do?&quot; asks Ronald Paul, a restaurant consultant. &quot;If you're known for your corn on the cob, and half the crop burns up, you'll have to serve half a cob.&quot;    FERTILIZER: Manufacturers expect a boom next year if the drought ends. &quot;There aren't many fertilizer reserves around the world. If farmers plant more acreage next year to make up for reduced production in 1988, prices will strengthen and the industry will be building new plants,&quot; says Cleve McCarty, the president of Denver-based Nu-West Industries Inc., which owns three fertilizer plants. Fertilizer currently costs about $175 a ton, down from $300 a ton in the 1970s.    ANTIFREEZE: In some areas, coolant prices have more than doubled to $10 a gallon this summer. Low water levels on the Mississippi River have reduced shipments of ethylene glycol, an essential ingredient. &quot;Prices could go a lot higher in September, the height of the buying season,&quot; says J. Thomas Hurvis, the owner of a Des Plaines, Ill., coolant maker.    RAILROADS: Navigation problems on the Mississippi have helped railroads increase grain shipments by 22% in the first six months of this year, according to the Association of American Railroads, a trade group. Some lines are shipping at night to avoid warped rails -- known as sun kinks -- that can develop during droughts.    STATE FAIRS: Some are scaling back. Bill Waddell, the director of the Missouri state fair, has dropped plans to hire singer Kenny Rogers. &quot;People can't pay $17 a ticket,&quot; he says. He will offer lesser lights for a $5 admission and expects such venerable -- and free -- events as pig racing to remain popular.    MULE SALES: Since it got hot, people have lost interest in mules. &quot;They figure a mule is too expensive to feed,&quot; says Claude O. Adams Jr., who has been raising mules in Lamar, Mo., for 20 years. But he is quick to observe that he sells a yearling for only $500, compared with $10,000 for a late-model used tractor.    VACATIONS: Campers in many areas of California and Idaho now need permits for campfires. &quot;We're experiencing wild fires in places we normally don't have them, like northern Minnesota and Wisconsin,&quot; says Steve Brown, a meteorologist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. &quot;Usually, thunderstorms douse things this time of year.&quot;    DUCKS: Their North American population of 62 million may have hit a historic low, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. &quot;These are the worst habitat conditions we have seen,&quot; says a spokesman. &quot;Many ducks aren't even trying to nest this year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
