While stopping short of calling for mandatory testing, theCDC said hospitals and health-care providers should&quot;routinely . . . encourage&quot; patients to be screened. Untilnow, the agency has recommended simply that testing beoffered, particularly in hospitals and clinics that are awareof a high prevalence of AIDS within their communities.</LP><TEXT>   Recent data, however, show that significant numbers ofpatients are unaware that they have contracted the humanimmune deficiency virus, said James Curran, director of theCDC's division of HIV and AIDS. By urging patients to givetheir consent to be tested, Dr. Curran said, &quot;we can getbetter medical management of their cases and provide themwith counseling.&quot;   While the CDC's draft recommendations, once put in finalform, wouldn't be binding on the medical community, theagency's guidelines often carry considerable weight withfederal and state regulators.   The proposal was met with immediate criticism from theAmerican Hospital Association, which questioned the CDC'sgoals and methods.   Fredric J. Entin, the AHA's senior vice president andgeneral counsel, said that if the CDC's objective is to limitthe spread of AIDS within hospitals and clinics, then testingmight be superfluous because current infection-controlmeasures are doing an adequate job.   &quot;If the CDC {is attempting} to create a mechanism toscreen the general population for HIV,&quot; Mr. Entin added in astatement, &quot;we question whether locating such testingprograms in hospitals is a practical and reasonable approachbecause only a fraction of the population is treated inhospitals during a given year.&quot;   At the American Foundation for AIDS Research, which hasheadquarters in New York and Los Angeles, Mathilde Krim,founding co-chairwoman, called the guidelines &quot;another bag ofworms.&quot; Testing patients, she said, could create a falsesense of security among health-care providers, because thevirus, in its earliest stages, can't always be detected.Moreover, a patient who is identified as being HIV-positive&quot;could be denied care,&quot; Dr. Krim said.   In the past year, health-care providers -- not patients --have been the focus of the national debate over AIDS testing.In July 1990, the CDC reported the first instance of a healthprofessional, a Florida dentist, infecting a patient. In themonths since, reports that the same dentist infected fouradditional patients, along with news stories in a half-dozenstates about physicians and dentists with AIDS who continueto practice their craft, have sparked demands thathealth-care providers be tested for the illness.   In July of this year, Health and Human Services SecretaryLouis W. Sullivan urged all health-care workers who performexposure-prone procedures -- those in which workers might becut and have their blood come in contact with a patient -- toundergo AIDS testing. He also recommended that individualswho test positive should stop performing such procedures --unless permission is received from both a medical reviewcommittee and the patient.   But, as in the case of the CDC's latest recommendations,Dr. Sullivan stopped short of calling for mandatory AIDStesting, noting that the odds of a medical provider infectinga patient are exceedingly remote.   While many clinicians will likely embrace the CDC's newguidelines, said William Schaffner, chairman of thedepartment of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University inNashville, Tenn., the issue of cost remains. &quot;While one armof the government is calling for increased testing,&quot; he said,&quot;the other arm -- Medicare and related agencies -- isn'tproviding the resources. We haven't resolved that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
