(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A $289 million contract for continuedproduction of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle for the U.S. Army hasbeen awarded to FMC Corp.'s ground systems division, the companysaid Thursday.   Work on the 334 infantry and 216 cavalry Bradley FightingVehicles and 44 Bradley carriers for the multiple launch rocketsystem will be done at the company's Santa Clara plant. Delivery isscheduled between May 1, 1989, and April 30, 1990.   The contract provides $280 million for the products, and $9million in a price-incentive contract to provide engineeringsupport in production.   Last December, Pentagon officials told Congress they planned tothicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent ``moresurvivable'' in battle. Other changes announced includedredesigning the fuel system, moving some ammunition around insidethe crew compartment and developing explosive armor.   The first Bradley Fighting Vehicle was delivered in 1982. FMC,based in Chicago, delivered about 3,100 Bradleys out of an order of6,880 for $1.55 million each as of last December. Most of thevehicles have been stationed in Europe.   Congressional, Army and FMC records show numerous mechanical andelectrical components on the vehicle designed as an amphibiousarmored personnel carrier have failed repeatedly in recent years.   But Col. Franklin Trapnell, system manager for the Bradley atthe Army's Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Benning, Ga., hassaid that the vehicle may have flaws but going into a war withoutit would ``cause us to lose and do a lot of dying in the process.''</TEXT></DOC>
