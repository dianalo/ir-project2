The suit, filed in Delaware state court, says the bank hastaken voting control of the company and removed Mr. Parretti,his wife and an associate from the MGM-Pathe board. The suitalso says Mr. Parretti violated an agreement with the bank byinterfering with a new management team headed by Alan LaddJr., throwing the studio into &quot;complete disarray.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The suit seeks court approval for the removal of Mr.Parretti, his wife and his associate, Yoram Globus, from theMGM-Pathe board. The suit also seeks court approval for theirreplacement by three new appointees.   In April, Mr. Parretti resigned as chairman and chiefexecutive officer of MGM-Pathe and its Pathe CommunicationsCorp. parent under pressure from Credit Lyonnais butcontinued as a director of both companies. MGM-Pathe wasformed in a $1.3 billion merger last November but hassuffered severe cash shortages, leading the Frenchstate-owned bank to inject additional cash into it to preventbankruptcy-law proceedings.   MGM-Pathe announced yesterday that Credit Lyonnais hasexpressed willingness to begin immediate talks aboutincreasing the $145 million credit line it extended to thestudio in April on the condition that Mr. Parretti step down.According to the suit, the $145 million was used up in just 21/2 months.   The suit charges that Mr. Parretti and his &quot;agents&quot;thwarted control of the new management team through a seriesof actions, including delivery of a stream of memos to MGMemployees and threats to act against members of the Laddmanagement team who didn't comply with Mr. Parretti'srequests. The suit indicates that Mr. Parretti attempted toretain control of hirings and firings and tried to overridean effort by the company's chief financial officer to controlexpenditures of more than $5,000.   The suit alleges that Mr. Parretti's efforts to thwartcontrol by the new management committee intensified after theexecutive committee named new directors and officers.   Credit Lyonnais has declined to comment on its involvementwith Mr. Parretti, and the suit details for the first timethe sequence of events that led to the bank's backing of Mr.Parretti in the merger last November.   The suit charges that Mr. Parretti appealed to the bank tomake short-term loans, or bridge financing, until certaininvestors who had made &quot;firm commitments&quot; came through withequity investments. The suit says the bank, which was alreadythe primary lender to Pathe Communications, controlled by Mr.Parretti, agreed and provided more than $300 million inbridge loans to companies controlled by Mr. Parretti.   The suit says the bank provided a further $400 millionthrough so-called factoring agreements, or distributionagreements relating to the sale of rights in the library. Andit says the bank agreed to extend a $125 million credit lineto the studio to finance film production after theacquisition.   Although Mr. Parretti had told the bank the bridge loanswould be repaid by Dec. 31, 1990, according to the suit, theother investors never materialized and Mr. Parretti'saffiliates never made any payments to the bank to reduce thedebt. The studio soon faced a cash crisis, and the bankcontinued to make advances under existing credit lines afterMr. Parretti proposed to sell assets.   However, despite another $200 million in advances from thebank, the suit says, the studio continued its financialhemorrhage, amassing unpaid debt that it blames on Mr.Parretti's management. The suit charges that Mr. Parretti hada &quot;personal and secretive management style&quot; that excludedmost managers and caused erratic and acrimoniousrelationships with remaining MGM officers.   The suit also charges that many critical employees werelaid off and that Mr. Parretti failed to establish soundaccounting procedures or a cash management system and failedto collect receivables generated by foreign operations. Italso charges that Mr. Parretti spent millions of dollars on&quot;questionable dealings with foreign entities&quot; in which Mr.Parretti held an interest.   The cash-flow problems delayed the release of completedmovies such as &quot;Thelma and Louise.&quot; The suit says that Mr.Parretti's management borrowed an additional $200 million tomeet operating expenses and projected a negative cash flow of$145 million.   Mr. Parretti, his wife and Mr. Globus couldn't be reachedfor comment.   The bank said it elected three newly named studioexecutives to the board. They are Charles R. Meeker,president, Kenneth Meyer, senior executive vice president,and William Allen Jones, executive vice president. The threesucceed Mr. Parretti, Mr. Parretti's wife, Maria Cecconi, andYoram Globus, who were removed by the bank.</TEXT></DOC>
