(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mastermind of a $2.4 millionself-chilling can fraud, who authorities said is cooperating inprobes of organized crime backing of penny stock frauds, wassentenced to 12 years in prison Wednesday.   Marshall Zolp pleaded guilty in April 1987 to racketeering forthe Lasar Arms case, in which he and 13 people were indicted forbilking investors with plans to introduce a bogus self-chillingbeverage container.   Three months later, five defendants who stood trial wereconvicted. Zolp, the 13th defendant sentenced, did not testify.   Zolp and his co-defendants promoted Laser Arms, incorporated inMarch 1986, through fake news releases, ads, and shareholder reportsto inflate the price. They even staged a phony news conference inNew York City. Actors were photographed to portray fictitiousexecutives on company documents.   His plea, part of an agreement to cooperate with the government,was unsealed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Alfred Lechner Jr.Zolp could have received 20 years in prison.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert P. Warren told Lechner of Zolp'scooperation in a number of stock fraud investigations, someinvolving organized crime members. Indictments are expected,authorities said.   He said Zolp was used as a ``vehicle'' by mobsters for committingstock frauds, and was ``viewed by a number of people as a personthey could franchise to make money for them.''   Zolp's defense attorney, Raymond Sussman of New York, wentfarther. He said that mobsters beat Zolp and threatened him tocontinue carrying out the Laser Arms fraud. Zolp, who was living inthe Los Angeles area, is in the witness protection program.   Sussman said that despite a ``track record'' of securitiesviolations, Zolp never meant to perpetrate such an extended fraud asLaser Arms.   Commenting after the hearing, Sussman said mob members kidnappedZolp, drove him out to Long Island, N.Y., and held a gun to hisside, saying he was to be murdered. Instead, they beat him.   ``They said, `This is just a warning. Go back to work,''' saidthe attorney. Sussman said his client was manipulated by figuresassociated with New York-area mob families.   In court, Sussman also revealed that Zolp had providedinformation to the FBI about members of a ``terrorist group'' jailedwith Zolp at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.Prosecutors would not identify the group further, but Sussman saidthey were two foreigners awaiting deportation who had legalproceedings in federal court in Newark, and that the information wasabout a possible escape attempt.   Two Sikhs accused of terrorism in India were recently orderedextraditable by a U.S. magistrate here. Zolp has spent the past twoyears at MCC, where the Sikhs are being held.   The Securities and Exchange Commission has implicated Zolp in atleast seven security fraud cases nationwide since the early 1980s.   According to an affidavit by an SEC attorney filed in federalcourt here, Zolp raised millions of dollars in stock offerings,using aliases, newspaper advertisements and misleading financialstatements _ living a high lifestyle off the proceeds.   A federal prosecutor two years ago said in court that Zolp``changes identities as easily as other people change theirclothes.'' The prosecutor, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney FaithHochberg, said Zolp even once dashed across the tops of dinnertables to escape the law.   Zolp served two years in Vietnam, carrying out 60 combat missionsbefore deserting to Europe, where he lived for six years beforereturning under an amnesty program and developing a drinkingproblem, said Sussman.   ``Jail has taught me fear, fear of ever having to return,'' Zolptold Lechner. ``I stand here shamed today. I stand here disgraced. Iam financially insolvent, however I am rehabilitated,'' he said.   But Lechner harshly rejected Zolp's claim of acting out ofcharacter.   ``Your conduct has been your character,'' the judge said. ``Youare a con man.''</TEXT></DOC>
