To reduce dimensions and simplifythe accelerator design a low Q-factor resonator in the form of coaxialline short-circuited at the end is used as end load. This line lengthis equal or multiple to the half of high-frequency oscillation wave length.To decrease the resonator Q-factor a part of its surface is covered withabsorbing coating. The medium part of the resonator where the electricalfield is maximal is free from coating. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
