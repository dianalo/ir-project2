I feel very tired.''   He said his captors treated him well.   Cools thanked ``especially Col. Moammar Gadhafi for getting mereleased.'' Gadhafi leads the radical North African Arab nation ofLibya.   The physician worked for the Norwegian humanitarian organizationNORWAC and was kidnapped May 21, 1988.   Upon his arrival in the Syrian capital, Cools was immediatelytaken to the home of Belgian Ambassador Andre Vokaer and declined tomake any statements to reporters.   Damascus airport officials said a Belgian military transportplane arrived at 11:30 p.m. with Cools' parents and two doctorsaboard. Embassy officials said the plane was to fly Cools home later.   Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain, who drove withCools from Lebanon, said Cools will stay in Damascus for a few days.   Fourteen other foreigners _ including nine Americans _ are heldhostage in Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. Three othersare missing.   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   In Sidon, Cools spoke with reporters in the apartment of MustafaSaad, whose predominantly Sunni Moslem militia has controlled thatcity 25 miles south of Beirut since Lebanon's civil war broke out in1975.   Younis Amran of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a Palestinianguerrilla group led by terrorist Abu Nidal, sat near Cools as thefreed relief worker spoke. Cools thanked Saad for ``efforts thatfacilitated my release.''   Amran said the group calling itself Soldiers of Justice, whichclaimed responsibility for abducting Cools, freed him at Gadhafi'srequest following ``efforts by us,'' and he was turned over to Saad.   An aide to Saad said Urbain and the minister's chief aide, RobertWillermain, drove from Damascus to Saad's residence especially forthe release. Speaking in French, Cools said before leaving Sidonthat his captors told him Thursday morning to ``take a shower.''   ``I took one, they bought me the new clothes that I am wearingnow and told me I will be released upon Col. Gadhafi's mediation.They brought me here.''   He was dressed in a beige shirt and trousers.   On Wednesday, the Soldiers of Justice issued a statement sayinghe would be freed in response to an appeal from Gadhafi. It saidnegotiations were conducted by the Abu Nidal faction.   ``We hope this goodwill gesture will awaken the conscience ofWestern nations to support the causes of the oppressed, especiallythe people of Palestine, who are subjected to daily killings anddestruction,'' it said.   There has been widespread speculation that Abu Nidal's groupkidnapped Cools, but spokesmen for the organization have denied it.   Police say the Soldiers of Justice is a name used by theterrorist's followers.</TEXT></DOC>
