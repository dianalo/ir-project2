Fokker Is In Doubt Despite Busy Assembly Lines </HL><AUTHOR> Susan Carey (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> ARO TNM </IN><DATELINE> AMSTERDAM  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three years ago, N.V. Fokker's aircraft-assembly plant here was a lonely place. The last of the company's F-28 jetliners were being fitted together in one hall, while Fokker's new projects were only drawings on a computer screen.    Today, there isn't a yard of space to spare. Rows of new F-50 turboprops fill two huge halls, sporting such logos as those for Philippine Airlines and Inter-Canadian on their tails. Another assembly hanger is crowded with F-100 jetliners for Swissair.    Fokker should be the envy of the aerospace industry. Its production is sold out until 1991. Technical journals tout its planes' performance. Its stock price is rising and its May share issue was a success.    Instead, Fokker faces extinction. Although the 76-year-old company has pulled out of dangerous spins before, its current recovery could be its last as an independent among aerospace giants. As part of a government financial bailout, Fokker is under orders to find a partner by 1990. But the proud company, whose customer list reaches back to the Red Baron and Amelia Earhart, doesn't want to lose its self-determination or its venerable name.    It may be dreaming. &quot;The development of a new generation of airplanes will cost a lot, and the government isn't willing to pay for it,&quot; says a spokesman for the Dutch Economics Ministry. &quot;And Fokker can't afford it.&quot;    The events of the past year -- cost overruns, a cash crisis, a management shakeup, production problems and a government rescue -- have made one thing plain: Fokker is too small, even with state subsidies, to go it alone in the big-bucks game of airplane manufacturing.    &quot;We agree with the government that Fokker, and Holland in general, is a little too narrow a base&quot; to support a full-blown aircraft builder, concedes Reinder J. Van Duinen, a board member and president of the Fokker Aircraft unit.    Most airplane builders of Fokker's modest size make much of their money as subcontractors to the big three -- Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie -- or to one another. Or they are part of large groups that make defense equipment or autos.    Fokker behaves more like one of the big three, contracting out work to the likes of West Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. It also designs and builds high-quality short-haul aircraft and -- normally -- turns a profit.    But the company has only 11,295 employees, compared with about 34,000 at McDonnell Douglas's civil-aircraft division alone. Fokker's current market value is a paltry 270 million guilders ($137 million), compared with $8.3 billion for Boeing. Fokker's defense work accounts for only 25% of revenue, while British Aerospace PLC rakes in 78% of its sales from military aircraft, weapons and electronic systems. Even with government help, Fokker's survival has been a small miracle.    &quot;In this type of game, you need a hell of a lot of money,&quot; says Erik Nederkoorn, Fokker's new board member for finance. &quot;The Japanese, the Germans put staggering amounts into new projects. . . . This company ha s always been fairly weak financially.&quot;    Fokker decided in 1983 to revive its fortunes by going after the growing market for regional airliners. It planned to update first its popular F-27 turboprop, then its F-28 twin-jet. But the government, which normally provides development credits, insisted on a single aid package of 800 million guilders. So Fokker simultaneously launched a new 50-seat commuter plane and a 100-seat jetliner, knocking itself out to satisfy customers' design requests.    Both new models, planned as derivatives, ended up being mostly new. Costs rose as Fokker agreed to special features like giving the Swissair version of the F-100 more cockpit automation and a different cabin layout and providing USAir Group Inc.'s USAir with a polished metal exterior and upgraded engines.    &quot;We underestimated the complexity of some customers' requirements,&quot; says Mr. Van Duinen.    The effort won some enviable customers, though. The F-100 has been ordered by the largest aircraft-leasing companies, GPA Group Ltd. of Ireland and International Lease Finance Corp. of the U.S. The F-50, aimed at Third World customers, has attracted orders from the likes of Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa's commuter affiliate, DLT.    The strains, however, were enormous and the price high. The two programs ran months late and 50% over budget. Though the government lent a further 100 million guilders in 1986, cash flow was squeezed as development costs mounted. The weak dollar made things worse.    Complicating matters, Fokker's finance director quit and its largest lenders asked the government to guarantee their loans to Fokker. Certain Dutch politicians started calling for the resignation of Frans Swarttouw, Fokker's chairman of 10 years.    Last October, the government moved to save Fokker from financial collapse with a cash infusion and other financial help. In return, Fokker agreed to let the government take a stake of up to 49% in the company. But in last month's rights issue, shareholders showed surprising demand for the new shares, leaving the government with only 16% of common stock. The state hasn't yet demanded a second rights issue and Fokker hopes it won't.    Emboldened by the offering's success and by recent orders, Fokker isn't feeling as desperate as it did a year ago. It expects to break even this year after 1987's 107 million-guilder loss. It has let The Hague know it won't rush into a partnership in which it would lose its independence.    It isn't clear what leeway the company might have in meeting the requirement that it find a partner. Statements from Fokker indicate it believes there is room for maneuver. &quot;We aren't ripe for the picking,&quot; warns Chairman Swarttouw. A spokesman adds that partnership doesn't necessarily mean merger.    There's no shortage of potential collaborators. Fokker said last fall it was talking to MBB, the West German company with a stake in Airbus, about increasing cooperation. Daimler-Benz AG could be another candidate. The Japanese may be interested in Fokker as well. Another solution would be an Airbus-type union among smaller European aerospace concerns.    For now, the company's efforts are aimed at the next sale and the next airplane on the assembly line. &quot;Gradually, we are finding our feet again,&quot; says Mr. Swarttouw. &quot;We have gone through the worst now and are back in the race.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
