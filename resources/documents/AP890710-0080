In Spain, fishermen and Greenpeace activists today tried to blockthe port of Cartagena to protest the government's failure to stopthe illegal use of driftnets in the Mediterranean, the environmentalgroup said.   The Pacific leaders are alarmed that drift net fishing, alsocalled gill net fishing, is ravaging fish stocks and threatening thePacific's economic future, said Cook Islands Prime Minister GeoffreyHenry.   Henry, briefing reporters after the opening session of two-dayannual conference of the South Pacific Forum on this South Pacificisland, said the Pacific island nations back an Australian proposalfor an international convention banning driftnet fishing.   The technique uses nets up to 30 miles long and 50 feet deep,which are set adrift by fishing boats for later collection. It hasbeen likened to strip mining of the ocean.   The method is designed to catch albacore tuna by their gills inthe net's fine mesh. But fish researchers say it also catches vastnumbers of dolphins, whales, seals, turtles and squid.   With stocks of Southern Pacific Albacore tuna estimated to beexhausted in two years, Henry said the Pacific leaders found thaturgent action is needed.   Henry said the Pacific Forum leaders particularly objected towhat he called Japan's intransigence ``in refusing to end drift netfishing.''   Henry said the conference will increase surveillance of their200-mile economic zones to prevent the fishing method.   The South Pacific Forum also includes the Federated States ofMicronesia, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea,Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.   In Cartagena, a Greenpeace communique said its flagship, theSirius, and 40 Spanish fishing vessels crowded into the harbor as aprotest. Spanish navy and port authorities said they were notauthorized to comment on the situation.   The London-based environmental organization said between 30 and40 Spanish-registered boats operating out of southern Spanish portsuse driftnets even though they are illegal in Spain.   The communique said commercial fisherman have noticed large dropsin their catches since the nets came into use two years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
