It's an apt analogy.   During November and December, many retailers ring up athird of their annual sales and half their profit. Yulereceipts can turn a good year like post-recession 1983 into agreat one. And a bad season can stop the show; just considerthe rash of post-Christmas retail bankruptcies in recentyears.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's become much more of a make-or-break season,&quot; saysCarl Steidtmann, chief economist for the Management Horizonsconsulting unit of Price Waterhouse. And, while only twomonths long, the Christmas shopping period often has distinctups and downs. In several of the past 10 years, for instance,shopping started slowly but ended briskly, saving the seasonfor many stores.   &quot;It's a tough time, but very exciting -- the adrenalinflows,&quot; says Jack Schultz, who spent 25 years at theBloomingdale's and B. Altman department stores before headingthe National Retail Federation. The big question, though, iswhether the dollars will flow. What's at stake thisChristmas, according to retail consultant Isaac Lagnado ofTactical Research Solutions, is nearly $80 billion inanticipated sales -- or nearly $320 for every American.   Here are the factors that help determine just how fullSanta's bag will be for retailers:                                                                                                          Economics: Christmas is the only time of year many storescan reap big profits. That's because holiday volume is solarge that retailers can cover fixed costs quickly and thuswatch a higher percentage of sales reach the bottom line --provided they aren't sitting on too much inventory.   Last Christmas was a disaster for many merchants becausethey weren't expecting the economy's slump. By fall, whenconsumer demand drooped, they had already stocked up, forcingthem to discount heavily at Christmas. The 1985 season wentfar more smoothly. Although many chains posted flat holidaysales or only modest gains, profits were healthy becauseretailers took fewer emergency markdowns.                                                                                                          Planning: &quot;Anticipating what the demand will be is verycritical,&quot; says Ira Silver, chief economist at J.C. PenneyCo. At most chains, Christmas planning is in full swing byearly February, when merchants hammer out their holiday-salesforecast. They base their hunches on last year's results, theeconomic outlook and just how much space they will devote toeach department.   Buyers then work backward from the sales plan, negotiatingspecial prices or markdown allowances with suppliers to helpcover the cost of holiday discounts. They place orders fourto eight months ahead of delivery, leaving themselves someflexibility on styles and sizes for final shipments. Thebiggest chains carry the most clout with suppliers so theyoften can get more hot-selling merchandise or, if salesslump, cancel some orders.   This year, for instance, Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. &quot;fullyanticipated a difficult environment,&quot; says Matthew Howard,senior vice president of marketing. Buyers spent much of thespring working out special prices with suppliers so Searscould offer such deals as a Thanksgiving weekend sale onmen's acrylic Jacquard-weave sweaters, marked down to $14.99from $24.99.                                                                                                          Hype: Retailers urge consumers to buy early so they'llfind the gifts they are seeking. But such advice, contendsMr. Lagnado, is &quot;fabled and overblown.&quot; Prices dip as theseason progresses, he explains, so the only reason to shopnow is to avoid last-minute crowds.   Sales early in the season do benefit retailers because thediscounts then usually aren't as hefty. Still, retailers mustwait until the two weeks before Christmas for nearly 40% oftheir holiday take. Mr. Lagnado predicts this year's lateshopping surge will be so pronounced that nearly one of fourholiday dollars will be spent in the five days beforeChristmas.                                                                                                          The Panic Button: Retailers can always hit the alarm belland slash prices if sales slip -- and they often do. Thanksto computers, it's easier nowadays to track what's hot andwhat's not. And stores no longer have to unleash their clerksto mark down prices; they simply program discounts intoelectronic cash registers.   The decision to go into an alarm-bell mode is usually madeat the highest levels. In late November last year, forinstance, senior marketing and merchandising executives atSears huddled to devise a plan to pump up sales; they gotapproval from Chairman Edward A. Brennan. The result: Inearly December, the company launched its traditionalpost-Christmas clearance sale on men's, women's andchildren's apparel.                                                                                                          Factors Beyond Their Control: Who could have predicted the1987 stock market crash or last year's Iraqi invasion ofKuwait, which sent consumer confidence plunging? Or even the1989 department-store price war triggered by cash-strappedretailers like Campeau Corp. chains and Macy's?   &quot;It seems like every Christmas, bad economic news comesout and has a dampening effect on consumer spending,&quot; saysMr. Steidtmann.   Then there is Mother Nature. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., whichtracks such things, contends that a two-degree temperaturedifference, plus or minus, from the norm is enough to affectsales. Retailers say it's especially true at Christmas, whenchilly thermometer readings and snow flurries help spur salesof sweaters, gloves and boots.   But as many weather theories abound as there are stores.Retailers have been known to blame slow sales on unseasonablywarm weather, unseasonably cold weather, rain, sleet andsnow.</TEXT></DOC>
