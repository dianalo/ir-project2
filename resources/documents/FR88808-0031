L. 91-508, 84 Stat. 1127-36, 15 U.S.C.1681-81t, sometimes referred to as the ``FRCA''), enacted on October 26,1970, and effective on April 24, 1971, is the first Federal regulationof the consumer reporting industry. This industry is comprised mostly ofcredit bureaus, investigative reporting companies, and other organizationsthat regularly gather and report information about consumers for use byothers in making decisions concerning those consumers, including credittransactions, insurance underwriting, or employment.The FCRA's basic purpose is to insure that consumer reporting agenciesexercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respectfor the consumer's right to privacy. The law requires that the manner inwhich consumers reporting agencies provide information be fair and equitableto the consumer with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, and properuse of such information.The FCFRA requires consumer report users to inform consumers when adverseaction is taken concerning credit, insurance or employment on the basisof such reports. Such a user must also identify the consumer reportingagency making the report.The FCRA gives the Federal Trade Commission primary responsibility forenforcing its provisions, by exercising its functions and powers underthe Federal Trade Commission Act. Although the Commission has taken formalaction against a number of consumer report providers and users, significantstaff enforcement activity has involved issuance of informal staff interpretations,contained in the staff's ``Compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act''manual (Compliance Manual), and in approximately 350 informal staff opinionletters responding to consumer and industry inquiries. The Commission hasalso issued eight formal interpretations of the FCRA (at 16 CFR 600.1-600.8),pursuant to andSection; 1.73 of the Commission's Rules (16 CFR 1.73). Someof the opinions have been superseded or overruled by subsequent staff interpretations,while others reflect a reading of the statute that the Commission now believesis either consistent with the FCRA legislative history or inappropriatein light of subsequent experience.The Commission believes that prior Commission and staff interpretationsshould be streamlined and brought up-to-date by promulgation of a CommissionCommentary on the FCRA. In preparing the proposed Commentary, the Commissionresolved inconsistencies in prior interpretations, discarded those thatit believes may not be supported by the FCRA or that merely paraphraseit, and summarized the remaining interpretations in the Commentary. Theproposed Commentary incorporates the Commission's position concerning theissues dealt with in the current eight formal interpretations, which wouldbe withdrawn upon the Commission's adoption of the Commentary. The interpretationsin the Commentary are not trade regulation rules or regulations, and, asprovided in andSection; 1.73 of the Commission's Rules, they do not havethe force or effect of statutory provisions.A primary purpose of the Commentary is to interpret the FCRA in a mannerthat gives effect to Congressional intent. In addition, the Commissionhopes that adopting a commentary format for interpetations will enhancethe document's usefulness in three major respects:First, the Commentary will present more comprehensive interpretations ofthe FCRA's provisions. A number of previous interpretations were limitedto specific facts and were therefore useful only to parties in very similarsituations. Where appropriate, the Commentary explains Commission policyin terms that may be applied to a range of situations. The Commentary alsoattempts to provide an in-depth discussion of certain portions of the statute.Third, the Commentary's recasting of seemingly inconsistent or inaccurateinterpretations will facilitate compliance with the FCRA.The proposed Commentary is intended to present the most useful existinginterpretations in a clear and comprehensible format. The interpretationshave been drafted to include only the essential elements of the principlesinvolved to make them easy to understand, and have been organized to correspondto sections of the Act that they construe, to make them easy to locate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Principal Changes From Prior Views</ITAG>The following paragraphs highlight some of the issues for which the Commentaryexpresses views that differ either in substance or emphasis from thoseexpressed in the current formal Commission interpretations, in the ComplianceManual, and in prior informal staff opinion letters. This list is not all-inclusive.1. <T3>Claims reports</T3> (section 603(d)). The Compliance Manual and somestaff interpretations have stated that a claims report_which is not normallya consumer report_can become a consumer report <T3>ab initio,</T3> when the insurer to which it is provided later usesthe report for underwriting purposes, with the result that its providermay be considered a consumer reporting agency.The Commentary rejects this position in situations in which the claimsreport provider has entered into a contract with the insurer-user thatstates such reports will not be used for underwriting purposes. The Commissionbelieves that a claims reporting service should not be deemed a consumerreporting agency because of an occurrence beyond its control_a unilateraluse decision by the insurer to which it provides a claims report.2. <T3>Prescreening</T3> (section 604(3)(A)). The Commission's ``prescreening''interpretation (16 CFR 600.5) sanctions the common process whereby a consumerreporting agency assists in the development of lists of qualified consumersto be solicited by its customers that market their products or servicesby direct mail. The consumer reporting agency uses the client's criteriafor creditworthiness to either (1) delete names that do not qualify froma list provided by the client or (2) create a list of creditworthy individualsfor solicitation. The interpretation requires that the user of the consumerreporting agency's service intend that each consumer whose name is on thelist after the prescreening will receive an ``offer of extension of creditfrom the company'', in which case a permissible purpose for the service(which amounts to a series of consumer reports) is deemed to exist undersection 604(3)(A) of the FCRA.The Commentary expands the concept of prescreening to encompass the situationswhere (1) demographic analysis is performed in preparing the list, in additionto the traditional credit screen by the consumer reporting agency, and(2) multiple lists of consumers, who meet different creditworthiness criteria,are provided to a client that intends to make different credit offers (<T3>e.g.,</T3> various credit limits) to consumers, based on which criteriathey meet. These changes expand the usefulness of prescreening to the clientsof consumer reporting agencies, without detracting from the privacy ofconsumers that is protected by section 604.3. <T3>Welfare fraud as a permissible purpose</T3> (section 604(3)(D)). Priorstaff interpretations stated or implied that only the government officecharged with <T3>granting</T3> a welfare benefit had a permissible purpose to obtaina consumer report in connection with welfare fraud, and/or that the permissiblepurpose applied only to the <T3>initial</T3> determination of a consumer's eligibility for the benefit.The Commentary makes it clear that <T3>any</T3> public office that is charged with determining a consumer'seligibility for such a benefit can obtain a consumer report on that consumerunder this section, and that it may do so to review the subject's <T3>continuing</T3> eligibility for the benefit, as well as to evaluatethe subject's initial application. In our view, the section's provisionof a permissible purpose should not be restricted by requirements not withinthe language of the statute.4. <T3>Reporting period for wage earner plans</T3> (section 605(a)(1)). TheCompliance Manual and some staff opinion letters state that wage earnerplans may be reported for only seven years, rather than for the ten yearreporting period provided by this subsection for reporting bankruptcies.However, the subsection states that it applies to ``cases under title 11of the United States Code,'' a description that clearly includes wage earnerplans, because they are covered by Chapter XIII of title 11. Thus, theCommentary concludes that wage earner plans may be reported for ten years.5. <T3>Reporting period for credit accounts</T3> (section 605(a)(4)). Somestaff interpretations have been unclear about the proper date from whicha consumer reporting agency should measure the permissible period for reportinga credit account that is charged to profit and loss or placed for collection.The Commentary states that the actual date the account was ``charged toprofit and loss'' or ``placed for collection'' starts the seven year reportingperiod with respect to that event. The fact that the delinquency occurredbefore the charge off (or placement for collection) does not require thatthe date be moved back, and the occurrence of a subsequent payment on theaccount does not permit the date to be moved forward.6. <T3>Notice to consumers of reports used for purposes other than credit,employment or insurance</T3> (section 607(b), section 615(a), FTC Act section5). Some staff interpretations have stated that consumer report users mustprovide notices to consumers under circumstances not limited to the expressprovisions of section 615(a), which requires users to provide notice thata consumer report was used as a basis for adverse action (and provide thename and address of the consumer reporting agency) only when credit, insurance,or employment is involved. Those letters opined that landlords who refusedto rent apartments, or merchants who used consumer reports as the basisfor adverse actions not covered by section 615(a), were required by section5 of the FTC Act to provide such notices. One interpretation stated thatsection 607(b) required consumer reporting agencies to compel such usersto provide such notices, implying that the notices would generate disputesby consumers that could improve the completeness or accuracy of the agencies'reports.The Commission believes that Congress intended to limit the number of situationsfor which section 615(a) requires notices to be sent, and that it is thereforenot appropriate to expand the number of such situations by broadly readingsection 607(b) or by invoking the Commission's authority under section5 of the FTC Act. Thus, the Commentary rejects the previously mentionedinterpretations, and concludes that (1) users need not provide such noticesand (2) consumer reporting agencies need not require them to do so.7. <T3>Extent of consumer reporting agency duty to respond to consumer ``completeness''claims </T3>(section 611). Staff opinions have been inconsistent or vagueas to whether this section, which imposes requirements on consumer reportingagencies and when consumers dispute the ``completeness'' of items in theirfiles, requires a consumer reporting agency to either (1) create new filesor add information about unreported accounts to consumer's file upon requestor (2) add to a consumer's file the consumer's statement that does notdispute the completeness or accuracy of any item, but only explains extenuatingcircumstances, such as ill health or a layoff, that led to credit delinquencies.The Commentary answers both questions in the negative, stating that thesection is designed to permit a consumer to dispute only the accuracy orcompleteness of items in the file. It takes the view that ``completeness''refers only to items of information contained in a consumer's file (notthe file as a whole), and that a consumer's statement solely concerningextenuating circumstances such as inability to pay obligations does notconstitute a dispute of the accuracy or completeness of the informationbeing reported. 8. <T3>Notice of consumer report to consumers not selected for employmentfor which they have not applied </T3>(section 615(a)). Staff interpretationshave been inconsistent as to whether an employer must send a ``section615(a)'' notice to consumers who are not selected for employment, promotionor reassignment, when they have not applied for the position.The Commentary concludes that section 615(a) does not require that an individualwho has not been selected for a position be given the notice in these circumstances,on the ground that a consumer has not been ``denied'' a position for whichhe or she never applied. <ITAG tagnum="84">Opportunity For Public Comment </ITAG>The Commission will accept written comments on the proposed Commentaryfor a period of sixty days. The Commission wishes to receive comments toaid in its consideration of the Commentary, which may have a substantialimpact on the consumer reporting industry, consumer report users, and consumers.Comments may be addressed to any aspect of the Commentary, including thefollowing: (1) Is a commentary the most appropriate or useful format in which to communicateCommission views on the FCRA? Are members of the public (including consumerreporting agencies, insurers, employers, creditors, debt collectors, consumers,and others) more likely to rely on the Commentary than on existing Commissionand staff interpretations of the Act? Why or why not?(2) The proposed Commentary attempts to (A) eliminate interpretations thatare considered to be relatively unimportant, (B) recast or correct otherinterpretations that appear inaccurate, or inconsistent with other morerecent interpretations, and (c) restate the remaining interpretations ina more understandable format. Are the modifications made by the proposedCommentary beneficial to the industry and other members of the public?Why or why not?(3) Are there any changes from prior Commission or staff interpretationsreflected in the Commentary that you think are particularly valuable? Ifso, which one(s) and why?(4) Are there any changes from prior Commisison staff interpretations thatshould have been made in the Commentary, but were not? If so, which one(s)and why? (5) The proposed Commentary requires that a firm offer of credit be madeto consumers who have been ``prescreened'' by a consumer reporting agency.(Comment 6 to section 604(3)(A); 16 CFR 600.5) Would sending an applicationor general advertising, instead of an offer, be consistent with the FCRAand its legislative history? Specifically, would it be appropriate forthe Commission to permit prescreening as long as the user of the servicewill send consumers on the final list an application for credit, or tootherwise liberalize its interpretation? Why or why not? (6) The user of an investigative consumer report must send the subjectof the report a notice stating that the report being prepared will includeinformation as to the individual's character, general reputation, personalcharacteristics, and mode of living (whichever are applicable), and thathe or she has the right to request a complete and accurate disclosure ofthe nature and scope of the investigation. The proposed Commentary takesthe position that this notice must also state that the report will involvepersonal interviews with sources such as neighbors, friends, and associatesof the consumer. (Comment 6 to section 606; <T3>National Indemnity Co., </T3>92 F.T.C. 416, 428, 431 (1978)) Wouldnotices that do not include this additional language be consistent withthe FCRA and its legislative history? Is the additional language in anyway burdensome? Specifically, would it be appropriate for the Commissionto require only that the notice include the items specifically set forthin section 606? Why or why not?(7) Some of users of consumer reports have both permissible and impermissiblepurposes for using those reports. A law firm or a detective agency maythus be able to procure reports for some purposes but not others. The proposedCommentary states that in those circumstances a separate certificationmust be made for each report that is ordered, and no general certificationsare permitted. (Comment 2C to section 607; <T3>Credit Data Northwest, </T3>86 F.T.C. 389, 391, 395 (1975), <T3>Credit Bureau of Columbus, </T3>81 F.T.C. 938, 940, 944 (1972), <T3>Credit Bureau of Lorain,</T3> 81 F.T.C. 381, 382, 384 (1972)). Is thisrequirement too restrictive, How burdensone (if at all) is the requirementthat each report be certified separately, How does the certification processwork in practice? Specifically, would it be appropriate for the Commissionto permit consumer reporting agencies to rely on a general certificationfrom such users (as is permitted for users such as creditors or insurers,which typically only have permissible purposes) or to use some other procedure(such as a general certification, combined with periodic audits) to ensurethat a ``mixed purpose'' user obtains reports only for permissible purposes?Why or why not? (8) Will any part of the Commentary as presently drafted impose unnecessaryburdens on industry or cause unnecessary injury to consumers, If so, whichpart(s) and why? (9) Are there aspects of FCRA compliance not addressed in the proposedCommentary that should be addressed at this time? If so what are they?<ITAG tagnum="84">Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act it is herebycertified that the proposed statements of general policy or interpretationswill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entitieswithin the meaning of the Act. They are not trade regulation rules or regulationsand the proposal would not cause a significant increase in compliance burdenson a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Because the Commentary may involve the ``collection of information'' asdefined in 5 CFR 1320.7(c), it has been submitted to OMB for review underthe Paperwork Reduction Act. The supporting Statement accompanying thatsubmission includes an estimate that, if the Commentary is issued in finalform, the public may spend some 1000 hours per year studying its contentsAlthough the Commentary will likely <T3>reduce </T3>the amount of time and effort spent determining complianceobligations imposed by the FCRA, publication of the document will leadthe public to spend some time and effort studying it that obviously wouldnot take place unless it is issued. The time and effort spent reviewingthe document will fall primarily on the credit reporting industry and thelawyers who advise it. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 600</ITAG>Credit, Trade practices.Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681s and 16 CFR 1.73, the Commission hereby proposesto revise 16 CFR Part 600 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 600_STATEMENTS OF GENERAL POLICY OR INTERPRETATIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">600.1 Authority and purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">600.2 Legal effect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix_Commentry on the Fair Credit Reporting Act</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 15 U.S.C. 1681s; and 16 CFR 1.73.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;600.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authority and purpose.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Authority.</T3> This part is issued by the Commission pursuant to theprovisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Pub.

This Commentary contains interpretations of the FederalTrade Commission (Commission) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).It is a guideline intended to clarify how the Commission will construethe FCRA in light of Congressional intent as reflected in the statute andits legislative history. The Commentary does not have the force or effectof regulations or statutory provisions, and its contents may be revisedand updated as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The quoted material contained in this Appendix is fromthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (Pub. L. 91-508, 84 Stat. 1127-36, 5 U.S.C1681-81t).2. <T3>Status of previous interpretations.</T3> The Commentary primarily addressesissues discussed in the Commission's earlier formal interpretations ofthe FCRA (16 CFR 600.1-600.8), which are hereby superseded, in the staff'smanual entitled ``Compliance With the Fair Credit Reporting Act'' (thecurrent edition of which was published in May 1973, and revised in January1977 and March 1979), and in informal staff opinion letters respondingto public requests for interpretations, and it also reflects the resultsof the Commission's FCRA enforcement program. It is intended to synthesizethe Commission's views and give clear advice on important issues. The Commentarysets forth some interpretations that differ from those previously expressedby the Commission or its staff, and is intended to supersede all priorformal Commission interpretations, informal staff opinion letters, andthe staff manual cited above.3. <T3>Statutory references.</T3> Reference to several different provisionsof the FCRA is frequently required in order to make a complete analysisof an issue. For various sections and subsections of the FCRA, the Commentarydiscusses the most important and common overlapping references under theheading ``Relation to other (sub)sections.'' FTC has set out excerpts ofFCRA for the convenience of the public.4. <T3>Issuance of staff interpretations.</T3> The Commission will reviseand update the Commentary as it deems necessary, based on the staff's experiencein responding to public inquiries about, and enforcing, the FCRA. The Commissionwelcomes input from interested industry and consumer groups and other publicparties on the Commentary and on issues discussed in it. Staff will continueto respond to requests for informal staff interpretations. In proposingrevisions of the Commentary, staff will consider and, where appropriate,recommend that the Commentary incorporate issues raised in correspondenceand other public contacts, as well as in connection with the Commission'senforcement efforts. Therefore, a party may raise an issue for inclusionin future editions of the Commentary without making any formal submissionor request to that effect. However, requests for formal Commission interpretationsof the FCRA may also still be made pursuant to the procedures set forthin the Commission's Rules (16 CFR 1.73).5. <T3>Commentary citations to FCRA.</T3> The Commentary should be used inconjunction with the text of the statute. In some cases, the Commentaryincludes an abbreviated description of the statute, rather than the fulltext, as a preamble to discussion of issues pertaining to various sectionsand subsections. These summary statements of the law should not be usedas a substitute for the statutory text.Section 601 Short Title<ITAG tagnum="21">``This title may be cited as the Fair Credit Reporting Act.''</ITAG>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is Title VI of the Consumer CreditProtection Act, which also includes other Federal statutes relating toconsumer credit, such as the Truth in Lending Act (Title I), the EqualCredit Opportunity Act (Title VII), and the Fair Debt Collection PracticesAct (Title VIII).Section 602 Findings and Purpose<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 602 recites the Congressional findings regarding the significantrole of consumer reporting agencies in the nation's financial system, andstates that the basic purpose of the FCRA is to require consumer reportingagencies to adopt reasonable procedures for providing information to creditgrantors, insurers, employers and others in a manner that is fair and equitableto the consumer with regard to confidentiality, accuracy, and the properuse of such information.</ITAG>Section 603 Definitions and Rules of Construction<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603)a) states that ``definitions and rules of constructionset forth in this section are applicable for the purposes of this title.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(b) defines ``person'' to mean ``any individual, partnership,coropration, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmentalsubdivision or agency or other entity.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>Certain ``persons'' must comply with the Act. The term ``consumer reportingagency'' is defined in section 603(f) to include certain ``persons.'' Section619 subjects any ``person'' who knowingly and willfully obtains informationfrom a consumer reporting agency on a consumer under false pretenses tocriminal sanctions. Requirements relating to report users apply to ``persons.''Section 606 imposes disclosure obligations on ``persons'' who obtain investigativereports or cause them to be prepared. Section 615(c) uses the term ``person''to denote those subject to disclosure obligations under sections 615(a)and 615(b).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Examples</ITAG>The term ``person'' includes universities, creditors, collection agencies,insurance companies, private investigators, and employers.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(c) defines the term ``consumer'' to mean ``an individual.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>The term ``consumer'' denotes an individual entitled to the Act's protections.Consumer reports, as defined in section 603(d), are reports about consumers.A ``consumer'' is entitled to obtain disclosures under section 609 fromconsumer reporting agencies and to take certain steps that require suchagencies to follow procedures in section 611, concerning disputes aboutthe completeness or accuracy of items of information in the consumer'sfile. Disclosures required under section 606 by one procuring an investigativereport must be made to the ``consumer'' on whom the report is sought. Notificationsrequired by section 615 must be provided to ``consumers.'' A ``consumer''is the party entitled to sue for willful noncompliance (section 616) ornegligent noncompliance (section 617) with the Act's requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. General</ITAG>The definition includes only a natural person. It does not include artificialentities (<T3>e.g.,</T3> partnerships, corporations, trusts, estates, cooperatives,associations) or entities created by statute (<T3>e.g.,</T3> governments, governmental subdivisions or agencies).<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(d) defines ``consumer report'' to mean ``any written,oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reportingagency bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, creditcapacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or modeof living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole orin part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer'seligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used primarilly for personal,family, or household purposes, or (2) employment purposes, or (3) otherpurposes authorized under Section 604'' (with three specific exclusions).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to ``Consumer Reporting Agency.''</ITAG>To be a ``consumer report,'' the information must be furnished by a ``consumerreporting agency'' as that term is defined in section 603(f). Conversely,the term ``consumer reporting agency'' is restricted to persons that regularlyengage in assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or otherinformation on consumers for the purpose of furnishing ``consumer reports''to third parties. In other words, the term ``consumer reporting agency''in section 603(f) and ``consumer report'' in section 603(d)) are mutuallydependent and must therefore be construed together. For example, informationis not a ``consumer report'' if the person furnishing the information isclearly not a ``consumer reporting agency'' (<T3>e.g.,</T3> if the person furnishing the information does not regularlyfurnish such information for monetary fees or on a cooperative nonprofitbasis).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Relation to the Applicability of the Act</ITAG>If a report is not a ``consumer report,'' then the Act does not usuallyapply to it.\2\<NOTE/> For example, because a commercial credit report is not areport on a consumer, it is not a ``consumer report''. Therefore, the userneed not notify the subject when taking adverse action, and the providerneed not omit ``obsolete'' information, as would be required if the Actapplied.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ However, a creditor denying a consumer's application basedon a report from a ``third party'' must give the disclosure required bysection 615(b).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Report Concerning a ``Consumer's'' Attributes and History</ITAG>A. <T3>General. </T3>A ``consumer report'' is a report on a ``consumer'' tobe used for certain purposes involving that ``consumer.''B. <T3>Artificial entities. </T3>Reports about corporations, associations,and other collective entities are not consumer reports, and the Act doesnot apply to them.C. <T3>Reports on businesses for business purposes. </T3>Reports used to determinethe eligibility of a business, rather than a consumer, for certain puroses,are not consumer reports and the Act does not apply to them, even if theycontain information on individuals.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. ``(C)redit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character,general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living. . . .'' </ITAG>A. <T3>General. </T3>To be a ``consumer report,'' the information must bearon at least one of the seven characteristics listed in this definition. B. <T3>Credit guides. </T3>Credit guides are listings, furnished by creditbureaus to credit grantors, that rate how well consumers pay their bills.Such guides are a series of ``consumer reports,'' because they containinformation which is used for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishingthe consumers' eligibility for credit. However, if they are coded (by identificationsuch as social security number, driver's license number, or bank accountnumber) so that the consumer's identity is not disclosed, they are not``consumer reports'' until decoded. (See discussion of uncoded credit guidesunder section 604(3)(A), item 8 <T3>infra.</T3>)  C. <T3>Motor vehicle reports. </T3>Motor vehicle reports are distributed bystate motor vehicle departments, generally to insurance companies uponrequest, and usually reveal a consumer's entire driving record, includingarrests for driving offenses. Such reports are consumer reports when theyare sold by a Department of Motor Vehicles for insurance underwriting purposesand contain information bearing on the consumer's ``personal characteristics,''such as arrest information. The Act's legislative history indicates Congressintended the Act to cover mutually beneficial exchanges of informationbetween commercial enterprises rather than between governmental entities.Accordingly, these reports are not consumer reports when provided to othergovernmental authorities involved in licensing or law enforcement activities.(See discussion titled ``State Departments of Motor Vehicles,'' under section603(f), item 10 <T3>infra</T3>.)  D. <T3>Consumer lists. </T3>A list of the names of creditworthy individuals,or of individuals on whom credit bureaus have derogatory information, isa series of ``consumer reports'' because the information bears on creditworthiness.  E. <T3>Public record information. </T3>A report solely of public record informationis not a ``consumer report'' unless that information bears on at leastone of the seven characteristics listed in the definition. Public recordinformation relating to records of arrest, or the institution or dispositionof civil or criminal proceedings, bears on one or more of these characteristics. F. <T3>Name and Address. </T3>A report consisting of the consumer's name andaddress alone, with no connotations as to credit worthiness or other characteristics,does not constitute a ``consumer report,'' because it does not bear onany of the seven factors.  G. <T3>Rental characteristics. </T3>Reports about rental charateristics (<T3>e.g., </T3>consumers' evictions, rental payment histories, treatmentof premises) are consumer reports, because they relate to character, generalreputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.  <ITAG tagnum="81">5. ``(U)sed or expected to be used or collected in whole or in partfor the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility* * *.''  </ITAG>A. <T3>Law enforcement bulletins. </T3>Bulletins that are limited to a seriesof descriptions, sometimes accompanied by photographs, of individuals whoare being sought by law enforcement authorities for alleged crimes arenot a series of ``consumer reports'' because they have not been collectedfor use in evaluating consumers for credit, insurance, employment or otherconsumer purposes, and it cannot reasonably be anticipated they will beused for such purposes.  B. <T3>Directories. </T3>Telephone directories and city directories, to theextent they only provide information regarding name, address and phonenumber, marital status, home ownership, and number of children, are not``consumer reports,'' because the information is not used or expected tobe used in evaluating consumers for credit, insurance, employment or otherpurposes and does not reflect on credit standing, credit worthiness, orany of the other factors. A list of names of individuals with checkingaccounts is not a series of consumer reports because the information doesnot bear on credit worthiness or any of the other factors. A trade directory,such as a list of all insurance agents licensed to do business in a state,is not a series of consumer reports because it is commercial informationthat would be used for commercial purposes.  C. <T3>Use of prior consumer report in preparation. </T3>A report that wouldnot otherwise be a consumer report may be a consumer report, notwithstandingthe purpose for which it is furnished, if it includes a prior consumerreport or information from consumer report files, because it would containsome information ``collected in whole or in part'' for consumer reportingpurposes. For example, an insurance claim report would be a consumer reportif a consumer report (or information from a consumer report) were usedto prepare it.  D. <T3>Use of reports for purposes not anticipated by the reporting party.</T3>The question arises whether a report that is not othewise a consumerreport is subject to the FCRA because the recipient subsequently used thereport for a permissible purpose. If the reporting party's procedures aresuch that it neither knows of nor should reasonably anticipate such use,the report is not a consumer report. If a reporting party has taken reasonablesteps to insure that such a report is not used for an impermissible purpose,and if it neither knows of, nor can reasonably anticipate such use, thereport should not be deemed a consumer report by virtue of uses beyondthe reporting party's control. A reporting party might establish that itdoes not reasonably anticipate such use of the report by requiring therecipient to certify that the report will not be used for one of the purposeslisted in section 604. (Such procedure may be compared to the requirementin section 607(a), discussed <T3>infra, </T3>that consumer reporting agencies furnishing consumer reportsrequire that prospective users certify the purposes for which the informationis sought and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose).For example, a claims reporting service could use such a certificationto avoid having its insurance claims reports deemed ``consumer reports''if the report recipient/insurer were to use the report later for ``underwritingpurposes'' under section 604(3)(C), such as terminating insurance coverageor raising the premium.  6. ``(E)stablishing the consumer's eligibility for (1) credit or insuranceto be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, or (2)employment purposes, or (3) other purposes authorized under Section 604'' A. <T3>Relation to Section 604. </T3>Because section 603(d)(3) refers to ``purposesauthorized under section 604'' (often described as ``permissible purposes''of consumer reports), some of which overlap purposes enumerated in section603 (<T3>e.g., </T3>603(d)(1) and 603(d)(2)), section 603 and 604 must be construedtogether, to determine what are ``consumer reports'' and ``permissiblepurposes'' under the two sections. See discussion <T3>infra, </T3>under section 604.    B. <T3>Commercial credit or insurance.</T3> A report on a consumer for creditor insurance in connection with a business operated by the consumer isnot a ``consumer report,'' and the Act does not apply to it.C. <T3>Insurance claims reports.</T3> (It is assumed that information in priorconsumer reports is not used in claims reports. See discussion,<T3> supra,</T3> in item 5-C under this subsection.) Reports obtained solelyto determine the validity of insurance claims are not consumer reports,because section 604(3)(C) specifically sets forth only underwriting (notclaims) as an insurance-related purpose, and section 603(d)(1) deals specificallywith eligibility for insurance and no other insurance-related purposes.To construe section 604(3)(E) as including reports furnished in connectionwith insurance claims would be to disregard the specific language of sections604(3)(C) and 603(d)(1).D. <T3>Scope of employment purpose.</T3> A report that is used or is expectedto be used or collected in whole or in part in connection with establishingan employee's eligibility for ``promotion, reassignment or retention,''as well as to evaluate a job applicant, is a consumer report because sections603(d)(2) and 604(3)(B) use the term ``employment purposes,'' which section603(h) defines to include these situations.E. <T3>Bad check lists.</T3> A report indicating that an individual has issuedbad checks, provided by printed list or otherwise, to a business for usein determining whether to accept consumers' checks tendered in transactionsprimarily for personal, family or household purposes, is a consumer report.The information furnished bears on consumers' character, general reputationand personal characteristics, and it is used or expected to be used inconnection with business transactions involving consumers.F. <T3>Tenant screening reports.</T3> A report used to determine whether torent a residence to a consumer is a consumer report, because it is usedfor a business transaction that the consumer wishes to enter into for personal,family or household purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exclusions From the Definition of ``Consumer Report.''</ITAG>A. <T3>``(Any) reports containing information solely as to transactions orexperiences between the consumer and the person making the report;''_</T3>(1)<T3>Examples of sources.</T3> The exemption applies to reports limitedto transactions or experiences between the consumer and the entity makingthe report (<T3>e.g.</T3>, retail stores, hospitals, present or former employers, banks,credit unions, or universities).(2) <T3>Information beyond the reporting entity's own transactions or experienceswith the consumer.</T3> The exemption does not apply to reports by theseentities of information beyond their own transactions or experiences withthe consumer. An example is a creditor's or an insurance company's reportof the reasons it cancelled credit or insurance, based on information froman outside source.(3) <T3>Opinions concerning transactions or experiences.</T3> The exemptionapplies to reports that are not limited to the facts, but also includeopinions (<T3>e.g.,</T3> use of the term ``slow pay'' to describe a consumer's transactionswith a creditor), as long as the facts underlying the opinions involveonly transactions or experiences between the consumer and the reportingentity.B. <T3>``(A)ny authorization or approval of a specific extension of creditdirectly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device;''</T3>_(1)<T3>General.</T3> The exemption applies to a credit card issuer's communicationof its decision whether or not to authorize a charge, in response to arequest from a merchant or other party that the consumer has asked to honorthe card.C. <T3>``(A)ny report in which a person who has been requested by a thirdparty to make a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly tothe consumer conveys his decision with respect to such request, if thethird party advises the consumer of the name and address of the personto whom the request was made and such person makes the disclosures to theconsumer required under section 615.''</T3>_(1) <T3>General.</T3> The exemption covers retailers' attempts to obtain creditfor their individual customers from an outside source (such as a bank ora finance company). The communication by the financial institution of itsdecision whether to extend credit is not a ``consumer report'' <T3>if</T3> the retailer informs the customer of the name and address ofthe financial institution to which the application or contract is offered<T3>and</T3> the financial institution makes the disclosures required bysection 615 of the Act. Such disclosures must be made only when there isa denial of, or increase in the charge for, credit or insurance. (See discussionof section 615, item 10 <T3>infra.</T3>)(2) <T3>Information included in the exemption.</T3> The exemption is not limitedto a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' response, but includes the information constitutingthe basis for the credit denial, because it applies to ``any report.''(3) <T3>How third party creditors can insure that the exemption applies.</T3>Creditors, who are requested by dealers or merchants to make such specificextensions of credit, can assure that communication of their decision tothe dealer or merchant will be exempt under this section from the term``consumer report,'' by having written agreements that require such partiesto inform the consumer of the creditor's name and address and by complyingwith any applicable provisions of section 615.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(e) defines ``investigative consumer report'' as ``a consumerreport or portion thereof in which information on a consumer's character,general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtainedthrough personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of theconsumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who mayhave knowledge concerning any such items of information. However, suchinformation shall not include specific factual information on a consumer'scredit record obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or froma consumer reporting agency when such information was obtained directlyfrom a creditor of the consumer or from the consumer.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>The term ``investigative consumer report'' denotes a subset of ``consumerreport'' for which the Act imposes additional requirements on recipientsand consumer reporting agencies. Persons procuring ``investigative consumerreports'' must make certain disclosures to the consumers who are the subjectsof the reports, as required by section 606. Consumer reporting agenciesmust comply with section 614, when furnishing ``investigative consumerreports'' containing adverse information that is not a matter of publicrecord. Consumer reporting agencies making disclosure to consumers pursuantto section 609 are not required to disclose ``sources of information acquiredsolely for use in preparing an investigative consumer report and actuallyused for no other purposes.''<ITAG tagnum="81">2. General</ITAG>An ``investigative consumer report'' is a type of ``consumer report'' thatcontains information that is both related to a consumer's character, generalreputation, personal characteristics or mode of living and obtained bypersonal interviews with the consumer's neighbors, friends, associatesor others.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Types of Sources Interviewed</ITAG>A report consisting of information from any third party concerning thesubject's character (reputation, etc.) may be an investigative consumerreport because the phrase ``obtained through personal interviews * * *with others'' includes any source that is a third party interviewee. Areport containing interview information obtained solely from the subjectis not an ``investigative consumer report.''<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Telephone Interviews</ITAG>A consumer report that contains information on a consumer's ``character,general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living'' obtainedthrough telephone interviews with third parties is an ``investigative consumerreport,'' because ``personal interviews'' includes interviews conductedby telephone as well as in person.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Identity of Interviewer</ITAG>A consumer report is an ``investigative consumer report'' if personal interviewsare used to obtain information reported on a consumer's ``character, generalreputation, personal characteristics or mode of living,'' regardless ofwho conducted the interview.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Noninvestigative Information in ``Investigative Consumer Reports''</ITAG>An ``investigative consumer report'' may also contain noninvestigativeinformation, because the definition includes reports, a ``portion'' ofwhich are investigative reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exclusions From ``Investigative Consumer Reports''</ITAG>A report that consists solely of information gathered from observationby one who drives by the consumer's residence is not an ``investigativeconsumer report,'' because it contains no information from``personal interviews.''<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(f) defines ``consumer reporting agency'' as ``any personwhich, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularlyengages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluatingconsumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purposeof furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any meansor facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishingconsumer reports.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>A. <T3>Duties imposed on ``consumer reporting agencies.''</T3> The Act imposesa number of duties on ``consumer reporting agencies.'' They must have permissiblepurposes to furnish consumer reports (section 604), avoid furnishing obsoleteadverse information in certain consumer reports (sections 605, 607(a)),adopt reasonable procedures to assure privacy (section, 604, 607(a)), andaccuracy (section 607(b)) of consumer reports, provide only limited disclosuresto governmental agencies (section 608), provide consumers certain disclosuresupon request (sections 609 and 610) at no cost or for a reasonable charge(section 612), follow certain procedures if a consumer disputes the completenessor accuracy of any item of information contained in his file (section 611),and follow certain procedures in reporting public record information foremployment purposes or when reporting adverse information other than publicrecord information in investigative consumer reports (sections 613, 614).B. <T3>Relation to ``consumer reports.''</T3> The term ``consumer reportingagency,'' as defined in section 603(f), includes certain persons who assembleor evaluate information on individuals for the purpose of furnishing ``consumerreports'' to third parties. Conversely, section 603(d) defines the term``consumer report'' to mean the communication of certain information bya ``consumer reporting agency.'' In other words, the terms ``consumer report''in section 603(d) and ``consumer reporting agency'' as defined in section603(f) are defined in a mutually dependent manner and must therefore beconstrued together. For example, a party is not a ``consumer reportingagency'' if it provides only information that is excepted from the definitionof ``consumer report'' under section 603(d), such as reports limited tothe party's own transactions or experiences with a consumer, or creditinformation on organizations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Isolated Reports</ITAG>Parties that do not ``regularly'' engage in assembling or evaluating informationfor the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties are notconsumer reporting agencies. For example, a creditor that furnished informationon a consumer to a governmental entity in connection with one of its investigations,would not ``regularly'' be making such disclosure for a fee or on a cooperativenonprofit basis, and therefore would not become a consumer reporting agency,even if the information exceeded the creditor's transactions or experienceswith the consumer.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Public Record Information</ITAG>A firm that regularly compiles and reports public record information aboutconsumers for use in connection with consumer transactions is a consumerreporting agency.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Employment Agency</ITAG>An employment agency that routinely obtains information on job applicantsfrom their former employers and furnishes the information to prospectiveemployers is a consumer reporting agency.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Information Compiled for Insurance Underwriting</ITAG>A business that compiles claim payment histories on individuals from insurersand furnishes them to insurance companies for use in underwriting decisionsconcerning those individuals is a consumer reporting agency.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Private Investigators and Detective Agencies </ITAG>Private investigators and detective agencies that regularly obtain consumerreports and furnish them to clients may thereby become consumer reportingagencies. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Collection Agencies and Creditors </ITAG>Collection agencies and creditors become consumer reporting agencies ifthey regularly furnish information beyond their transactions or experienceswith consumers for use in connection with consumers' transactions. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Joint Users of Consumers Reports </ITAG>Entities that share consumer reports with others that are jointly involvedin decisions for which there are permissible purposes to obtain the reportsmay be ``joint users'' rather than consumer reporting agencies. For example,if a lender forwards consumer reports to governmental agencies administeringloan guarantee programs, or to other prospective loan insurers or guarantors,or to another creditor for use in considering a consumer's loan applicationat the consumer's request, the lender does not become a consumer reportingagency by virtue of such action. An agent or employee that obtains consumerreports does not become a consumer reporting agency by sharing such reportswith its principal or employer in connection with the purposes for whichthe reports were initially obtained. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Loan Exchanges </ITAG>Loan exchanges, which are generally owned and operated on a cooperativebasis by consumer finance companies, constitute a mechanism whereby eachmember furnishes the exchange information concerning the full identityand loan amount of each of its borrowers, and receives information fromthe exchange concerning the number and types of outstanding loans for eachof its applicants. A loan exchange or any other exchange that regularlycollects information bearing on decisions to grant consumers credit orinsurance for personal, family or household purposes, or employment, isa ``consumer reporting agency.''<ITAG tagnum="81">10. State Departments of Motor Vehicles </ITAG>State motor vehicle departments are ``consumer reporting agencies'' ifthey regularly furnish motor vehicle reports containing information bearingon the consumer's ``personal characteristics,'' such as arrest information,to insurance companies for insurance underwriting purposes. (See discussionof motor vehicle reports under section 603(d), item 4c <T3>supra</T3>.)<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Federal Agencies</ITAG>The Office of Personnel Management collects and files data concerning currentand potential employees of the Federal Government and transmits that informationto other government agencies for employment purposes. Because Congressdid not intend that the FCRA apply to the Office of Personnel Managementand similar federal agencies (see 116 Cong. Rec. 36576 (1970) (remarksof Rep. Brown)), no such agency is a ``consumer reporting agency.'' <ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(g) defines ``file,'' when used in connection with informationon any consumer, to mean ``all of the information on that consumer recordedand retained by a consumer reporting agency regardless of how the informationis stored.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections </ITAG>Consumer reporting agencies are required to make disclosures of all informationin their ``files'' to consumers upon request (section 609) and to followreinvestigation procedures if the consumer disputes the completeness oraccuracy of any item of information contained in his ``file'' (section611). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. General </ITAG>The term ``file'' denotes all information on the consumer that is recordedand retained by a consumer reporting agency that might be furnished, orhas been furnished, in a consumer report on that consumer. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Audit Trail </ITAG>The term ``file'' does not include an ``audit trail'' (a list of changesmade by a consumer reporting agency to a consumer's credit history record,maintained to detect fraudulent changes to that record), because such informationis not furnished in consumer reports or used as a basis for preparing them.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Other Information </ITAG>The term ``file'' does not include information in billing records or inthe consumer relations folder that a consumer reporting agency opens ona consumer who obtains disclosures or files a dispute, if the informationhas not been used in a consumer report and would not be used in preparingone. <ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(h) defines ``employment purposes'' to mean ``a reportused for the purpose of evaluating a consumer for employment, promotion,reassignment or retention as an employee.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections </ITAG>The terms ``employment purposes'' is used as part of the definition of``consumer reports'' (section 603(d)(2)) and as a permissible purposessfor the furnishing of consumer reports (section 604(3)(B)). Where an investigativeconsumer report is to be used for ``employment purposes'' for which a consumerhas not specifically applied, section 606(a)(2) provides that the noticeotherwise required by section 606(a)(1) need not be sent. When a consumerreporting agency furnishes public record information in reports ``for employmentpurposes,'' it must follow the procedure set out in section 613. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Security Clearance </ITAG>A report in connection with security clearances of a government contractor'semployees would be for ``employment purposes'' under this section. <ITAG tagnum="20">Section 603(i) defines ``medical information'' to mean ``informationor records obtained, with the consent of the individual to whom it relates,from licensed physicians or medical practitioners, hospitals, clinics,or other medical or medically related facilties.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections. </ITAG>Under section 609(a)(1), a consumer reporting agency must, upon the consumer'srequest and proper identification, disclose the nature and substance ofall information in its files ont he consumer, except ``medical information.''<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information From Non-medical Sources. </ITAG>Information from non-medical sources such as employers, is not ``medicalinformation.'' Section 604 Permissible Purposes of Reports <ITAG tagnum="20">``A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report underthe following circumstances and no other: * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Section 603. </ITAG>Sections 603(d)(3) and 604 must be construed together to determine whatare ``permisible purposes,'' because section 603(d)(3) refers to ``purposesauthorized under section 604'' (often described as ``permissible purposes''of consumer reports), and some purposes are enumerated in section 603 (e.g.,sections 603(d)(1) and 603(d)(2). Subsections of sections 603 and 604 thatspecifically set forth ``permissible purposes'' relating to credit, insuranceand employment, are the only subsections that cover ``permissible purposes''relating to those three areas. Section 604(3)(E), a general subsection,is limited to purposes not otherwise addressed in section 604(3) (A)-(D).A. <T3>Credit.</T3> Sections 603(d)(1)_which defines ``consumer report'' toinclude certain reports for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishingthe consumer's eligibility for credit or insurance primarily for personal,family, or household purposes_and 604(3)(A) must be read together as fullydescribing permissible purposes involving credit for obtaining consumerreports. Accordingly, section 604(3)(A) permits the furnishing of a consumerreport for use in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer,primarily for personal, family or household purposes, and involving theextension of credit to, or review or collection of an account of, the consumer.B. <T3>Insurance.</T3> Sections 603(d)(1) and 604(3)(C) must be read togetheras describing the only permissible insurance purposes for obtaining consumerreports. Accordingly, section 604(3)(C) permits the furnishing of a consumerreport, provided it is for use in connection with the underwriting of insuranceinvolving the consumer, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.C. <T3>Employment.</T3> Employment is covered exclusively by sections 603(d)(2)and 604(3)(B), and by section 603(h) (which defines ``employment purposes'').Therefore, ``permissible purposes'' relating to employment include reportsused for evaluating a consumer ``for employment, promotion, reassignmentor retention as an employee.'' D. <T3>Other purposes.</T3> ``Other purposes'' are referred to in section603(d)(3) and covered by section 604(3)(E), as well as sections 604(1),604(2) and 604(3)(D) (which contain specific purposes not involving credit,insurance, employment). Permissible purposes relating to Section 604(3)(E)are limited to transactions that consumers enter into primarily for personal,family or household purposes (excluding credit, insurance or employment,which are specifically covered by other subsections discussed above). TheAct does not cover reports furnished for transactions that consumers enterinto primarily in connection with businesses they operate (e.g., a consumer'srental of equipment for use in his retail store). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Relation to Other Sections. </ITAG>A. <T3>Section 607(a).</T3> Section 607(a) requires consumer reporting agenciesto keep information confidential by furnishing consumer reports only forpurposes listed under section 604, and to follow specified, reasonableprocedures to achieve this end. Section 619 provides criminal sanctionsagainst any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on aconsumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses. B. <T3>Section 608.</T3> Section 608 allows ``consumer reporting agencies''to furnish governmental agencies specified identifying information concerningconsumers, notwithstanding the limitations of section 604.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 604(1)_A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumerreport ``in response to the order of a court having jurisdiction to issuesuch an order.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Subpoena </ITAG>A subpoena, including a grand jury subpoena, is not an ``order of a court''unless signed by a judge. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Internal Revenue Service Summons </ITAG>An I.R.S. summons is an exception to the requirement that an order be signedby a judge before it constitutes an ``order of a court'' under this section,because a 1976 revision to Federal statutes (26 U.S.C. 7609) specificallyrequires a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report in responseto an I.R.S. summons upon receipt of the designated I.R.S. certificatethat the consumer has not filed a timely motion to quash the summons.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 604(2)_A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumerreport ``in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer towhom it relates'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. No Other Permissible Purpose Needed </ITAG>If the report subject furnished written authorization for a report, thatcreates a permissible purpose for furnishing the report. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Refusal to Furnish Report </ITAG>The consumer reporting agency may refuse to furnish the report becausethe statute is permissive, not mandatory. (Requirements that consumer reportingagencies make disclosure to consumers (as contrasted with furnishing reportsto users) are discussed under section 609 and 610, infra.)<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 604(3)(A)_A consumer reporting agency may issue a consumerreport to ``a person which it has reason to believe . . . intends to usethe information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumeron whom the information is to be furnished and involving the extensionof credit to, or review or collection of an account of, the consumer;''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Reports Sought in Connection with the ``Review or Collection ofan Account.'' </ITAG>A. <T3>Reports for collection. </T3>A collection agency has a permissiblepurpose under this section to receive a consumer report on a consumer foruse in attempting to collect that consumer's debt, regardless of whetherthat debt is assigned or referred for collection. Similarly, a detectiveagency or private investigator, attempting to collect a debt owed by aconsumer, would have a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer reporton that individual for use in collecting that debt. An attorney may obtaina consumer report under this section on a consumer for use in connectionwith a decision whether to sue that individual to collect a credit account.B. <T3>Unsolicited reports. </T3>A consumer reporting agency may not sendan unsolicited consumer report to the recipient of a previous report onthe same consumer, because the recipient will not necessarily have a permissiblepurpose to receive the unsolicited report.\3\<NOTE/> For example, the recipient may have rejected the consumer'sapplication or ceased to do business with the consumer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Of course a consumer reporting agency must furnish notificationsrequired by section 611(d), upon the consumer's requests, to prior recipientsof reports containing disputed information that is deleted or that is thesubject of a dispute statement under section 611(b). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Judgment Creditors </ITAG>A judgment creditor has a permissible purpose to receive a consumer reporton the judgment debtor for use in connection with collection of the judgmentdebt, because it is in the same position as any creditor attempting tocollect a debt from a consumer who is the subject of a consumer report.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Child Support Debts </ITAG>A district attorney's office or other child support agency may obtain aconsumer report in connection with enforcement of the report subject'schild support obligation, established by court (or quasi-judicial administrative)orders, since the agency is acting as or on behalf of the judgment creditor,and is, in effect, collecting a debt. However, a consumer reporting agencymay not furnish consumer reports to child support agencies seeking to <T3>establish </T3>paternity or the duty to pay child support.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Tax obligations</ITAG>A tax collection agency has no general permissible purpose to obtain aconsumer report to collect delinquent tax accounts, because this subsectionapplies only to collection of ``credit'' accounts. However, if a tax collectionagency acquired a tax lien having the same effect as a judgment or obtaineda judgment, it would be a judgment creditor and would have a permissiblepurpose for obtaining a consumer report on the consumer who owed the tax.Similarly, if a consumer taxpayer entered an agreement with a tax collectionagency to pay taxes according to some timetable, that agreement would createa debtor-creditor relationship, thereby giving the agency a permissiblepurpose to obtain a consumer report on that consumer.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Information on an Applicant's Spouse</ITAG>A. <T3>Permissible purpose. </T3>A creditor may request any information concerningan applicant's spouse if that spouse will be permitted to use the accountor will be contractually liable upon the account, or the applicant is relyingon the spouse's income as a basis for repayment of the credit requested.A creditor, therefore, may request any information concerning an applicant'sspouse if (1) the state law doctrine of necessaries applies to the transaction,or (2) the applicant resides in a community property state, or (3) theproperty upon which the applicant is relying as a basis for repayment ofthe credit requested is located in such a state, or (4) the applicant isacting as the agent of the nonapplicant spouse.B. <T3>Lack of permissible purpose. </T3>If the creditor receives informationclearly indicating that the applicant is not acting as the agent of thenonapplicant spouse, and that the applicant is relying only on separateproperty to repay the credit extended, and that the state law doctrineof necessaries does not apply to the transaction and that the applicantdoes not reside in a community property state, the creditor does not havea permissible purpose for obtaining a report on a nonapplicant spouse.A permissible purpose for making a consumer report on a nonapplicant spousecan never exist under the FCRA, where Regulation B, issued under the EqualCredit Opportunity Act (12 CFR 202), prohibits the creditor from requestinginformation on such spouse. There is no permissible purpose to obtain aconsumer report on a nonapplicant former spouse or on a nonapplicant spousewho has legally separated or otherwise indicated an intent to legally disassociatewith the marriage. (This does not preclude reporting a prior joint creditaccount of former spouses for which the spouse that is the subject of thereport is still contractually liable. See discussion in section 607, item3-D <T3>infra</T3>.)<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Prescreening</ITAG>``Prescreening'' means the process whereby a consumer, reporting agency,using the client's criteria for creditworthiness, compiles lists of qualifiedconsumers (or deletes unqualified consumers from client-supplied lists)to be solicited by its clients who market products or services by directmail solicitations. The process may also include demographic analysis ofthe consumer on the list (<T3>e.g., </T3>use of census tract data reflecting real estate values)by the consumer reporting agency or by a third party employed for thatpurpose before the list is provided to the consumer reporting agency'sclient. In such situations, the client's creditworthiness criteria maybe provided only to the consumer reporting agency and not to the thirdparty performing the demographic analysis. The consumer reporting agencythat performs a ``prescreening'' service may furnish a client with severaldifferent lists of consumers who meet different sets of creditworthinesscriteria supplied by the client, who intends to make different credit offers(<T3>e.g., </T3>various credit limits) to consumers who meet the differentcriteria.A prescreened list constitutes a series of consumer reports, because thelist conveys the information that each consumer named meets certain criteriafor creditworthiness. Prescreening is permissible under the FCRA if theclient agrees in advance that each consumer whose name is on the list afterprescreening will receive an offer of credit. In these circumstances, apermissible purpose for the prescreening service exists under this section,because of the client's present intent to grant credit to all consumerson the final list, with the result that the information is used ``in connectionwith a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the informationis to be furnished and involving the extension of credit to * * * the consumer.''<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Seller of Property Extending Credit</ITAG>A seller of property has permissible purpose under this subsection to obtaina consumer report on a prospective purchaser to whom he is planning toextend credit.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Uncoded Credit Guides</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may not furnish an uncoded credit guide, becausethe recipient does not have a permissible purpose to obtain a consumerreport on each consumer listed. (As discussed under section 603(d), item4 supra, credit guides are listings that credit bureaus furnish to creditgrantors, rating how consumers pay their bills. Such guides are a seriesof ``consumer reports'' on the ``consumers'' listed therein, unless codedso that the consumer's identity is not disclosed.)<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Liability for Bad Checks</ITAG>A party attempting to recover the amount due on a bad check is attemptingto collect a debt and, therefore, has a permissible purpose to obtain aconsumer report on the consumer who wrote it, and on any other consumerwho is liable for the amount of that check under applicable state law.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 604(3)(B)_A consumer reporting agency may issue a consumerreport to ``a person which it has reason to believe * * * intends to usethe information for employment purposes;'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1.

Consumer Reports on Applicants and Non-applicants</ITAG>An employer may obtain a consumer report for use in evaluating the subject'sapplication for employment but may not obtain a consumer report to evaluatethe application of a consumer who is not the subject of the report.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Grand Jurors</ITAG>The fact that grand jurors are usually paid a stipend for their servicedoes not provide a district attorney's office a permissible purpose forobtaining consumer reports on them, because such service is a duty, not``employment.''<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 604(3)(C)_A consumer reporting agency may isue a consumerreport to ``a person which it has reason be believe * * * intends to usethe information in connection with the underwriting of insurance involvingthe consumer;''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Underwriting</ITAG>An insurer may obtain a consumer report to decide whether or not to issuea policy to the consumer, the amount and terms of coverage, the durationof the policy, the rates or fees charged, or whether or not to renew orcancel a policy, because these are all ``underwriting'' decisions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Claims Reports</ITAG>An insurer may not obtain a consumer report for the purpose of evaluatinga claim (to ascertain its validity or otherwise determine what action shouldbe taken), because permissible purposes relating to insurance are limitedby this section to ``underwriting'' purposes.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 604(3)(D)_A consumer reporting agency may issue a consumerreport to ``a person which it has reason to believe * * * intends to usethe information in connection with a determination of the consumer's eligibilityfor a license or other benefit granted by a governmental instrumentalityrequired by law to consider an applicant's financial responsibility orstautus * * *.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Appropriate recipient</ITAG>Any party charged with responsibility for assessing the consumer's eligibiiltyfor the benefit (not only the agency directly responsible for administeringthe benefit) has a permissible purpose to receive a consumer report. Forexample, a district attorney's office or social services bureau, requiredby law to consider a consumer's financial status in determining whetherthat consumer qualifies for welfare benefits, has a permissible purposeto obtain a report on the consumer for that purpose. Similarly, consumerreporting agencies may furnish consumer reports to townships on consumerswhose financial status the townships are required by law to consider indetermining the consumers' eligibility for assistance.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Inappropriate Recipient</ITAG>Parties not charged with the responsibility of determining a consumer'seligibility for a license or other benefit, for example, a party competingfor an FCC radio station construction permit, would not have a permissiblepurpose to obtain a consumer report on that consumer.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Initial or Continuing Benefit</ITAG>The permissible purpose includes the determination of a consumer's continuingeligibility for a benefit, as well as the evaluation of a consumer's initialapplication for a benefit. If the governmental body has reason to believea particular consumer's eligibility is in doubt, or wishes to conduct randomchecks to confirm eligibility, it has a permissible purpose to receivea consumer report.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 604(3)(E)_A consumer reporting agency may issue a consumerreport to ``a person which it has reason to believe * * * otherwise hasa legitimate business need for the information in connection with a businesstransaction involving the consumer.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Subsections of Section 604(3)</ITAG>The issue of whether credit, employment, or insurance provides a permissiblepurpose is determined exclusively by reference to subsections (A), (B),or (C), respectively.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Commercial Transactions</ITAG>The term ``business transaction'' in this section means a business transactionwith a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.Business transactions that involve purely commercial purposes are not coveredby the Act. Therefore, a consumer reporting agency may furnish a reporton an individual to a business that has a commercial purpose for obtainingthe report, and the Act does not apply to such report.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. ``Legitimate Business Need.''</ITAG>Under this subsection, a party has a permissible purpose to obtain a consumerreport on a consumer for use in connection with some action the consumertakes from which he or she might expect to receive a benefit that is notmore specifically covered by subsections (A), (B), or (C). For example,a consumer report may be obtained on a consumer who applies to rent anapartment, offers to pay for goods with a check, applies for a checkingaccount or similar service, seeks to be included in a computer dating service,or who has sought and received over-payments or government benefits thathe has refused to return.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Litigation</ITAG>The possibility that a party may be involved in litigation involving aconsumer does not provide a permissible purpose for that party to receivea consumer report on such consumer under this subsection, because litigationis not a ``business transaction'' involving the consumer. Therefore, potentialplaintiffs may not always obtain reports on potential defendants to determinewhether they are worth suing. The transaction that gives rise to the litigationmay or may not provide a permissible purpose. A party seeking to sue ona <T3>credit </T3>account would have a permissible purpose under section604(3)(A). (That section also permits judgment creditors and lien creditorsto obtain consumer reports on judgment debtors or individuals whose propertyis subject to the lien creditor's lien.) If that transaction is a businesstransaction involving the consumer, there is a permissible purpose. Ifthe litigation arises from a tort, there is no permissible purpose. Similarly,a consumer report may not be obtained solely for use in discrediting awitness at trial or for locating a witness. This section does not permitconsumer reporting agencies to furnish consumer reports for the purposeof locating a person suspected of committing a crime. (As stated in thediscussion of section 608 <T3>infra</T3> (item 2), section 608 permits the furnishing of specified,limited identifying information to governmental agencies, notwithstandingthe provisions of section 604.)<ITAG tagnum="81">5.

Agents</ITAG>A. <T3>General.</T3> An agent \4\<NOTE/> of a party with a ``permissible purpose'' may obtain a consumerreport on behalf of his principal, where he is involved in the decisionthat gives rise to the permissible purpose. Such involvement may includethe agent's making a decision (or taking action) for the principal, orassisting the principal in making the decision (<T3>e.g., </T3>by evaluating information). In these circumstances, theagent is acting on behalf of the principal. In some cases, the agent andprincipal are referred to as ``joint users.'' See discussion in section603(f), <T3>supra</T3>, (item 8). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Of course agents <T3>and</T3> principals are bound by the Act.B. <T3>Real Estate agent.</T3> A real estate agent may obtain a consumer reporton behalf of a seller, to evaluate the eligibility as a prospective purchaserof a subject who has expressed an interest in purchasing property fromthe seller.C. <T3>Private detective agency.</T3> A private detective agency may obtaina consumer report as agent for its client while investigating a reportsubject that is a client's prospective employee, or in connection withadvising a client concerning a business transaction with the report subjector in attempting to collect a debt owed its client by the subject of thereport. In these circumstances, the detective agency is acting on behalfof its client.D. <T3>Rental clearance agency.</T3> A rental clearance agency that obtainsconsumer reports to assist owners of residential properties in screeningconsumers as tenants, has a permissible purpose to obtain the reports,if it uses them in applying the landlord's criteria to approve or disapprovethe subjects as tenant applicants. Similarly, an apartment manager investigatingapplicants for apartment rentals by a landlord may obtain consumer reportson these applicants.E. <T3>Attorney.</T3> An attorney collecting a debt for a creditor client,including a party suing on a debt or collecting on behalf of a judgmentcreditor or lien creditor, has a permissible purpose to obtain a consumerreport on the debtor to the same extent as the client.Section 604 General<ITAG tagnum="81">1.

Consumer's Permission not Needed</ITAG>When permissible purposes exist, parties may obtain, and consumer reportingagencies may furnish, consumer reports without the consumers' permission.Similarly, parties may furnish information concerning their transactionswith consumers to consumer reporting agencies and others, and consumerreporting agencies may gather information, without consumers' permission.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. User's Disclosure of Report to Subject Consumer</ITAG>The FCRA does not prohibit a consumer report user from giving a copy ofthe report, or otherwise disclosing it, to the consumer who is the subjectof the report.Section 605 Obsolete Information<ITAG tagnum="20">``(a) Except as authorized under subsection (b), no consumer reportingagency may make any consumer report containing any of the following itemsof information * * *:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(b) The provisions of subsection (a) are not applicable in the caseof any consumer credit report to be used in connection with_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(1) a credit transaction involving, or which may reasonably be expectedto involve, a principal amount of $50,000 or more;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(2) the underwriting of life insurance involving, or which may reasonablybe expected to involve, a face amount of $50,000 or more; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(3) the employment of any individual at an annual salary which equals,or which may reasonably be expected to equal $20,000, or more.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. General</ITAG>Section 605(a) provides that most adverse information more than seven yearsold may not be reported, except in certain circumstances set out in section605(b). With respect to delinquent accounts, accounts placed for collection,and accounts charged to profit and loss, there are many dates that couldbe deemed to commence seven year reporting periods. The discussion in subsections(a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6) is intended to set forth a clear, workable rulethat effectuates Congressional intent.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Favorable Information</ITAG>The Act imposes no time restriction on reporting of information that isnot adverse.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Retention of Information in Files</ITAG>Consumer reporting agencies may retain obsolete adverse information andfurnish it in reports for purposes that are exempt under subsection (b)(<T3>e.g.,</T3> credit for a principal amount of $50,000 or more).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Use of Shorter Periods</ITAG>The section does not require consumer reporting agencies to report adverseinformation for the time periods set forth, but only prohibits them fromreporting adverse items beyond those time periods.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Inapplicability to Users</ITAG>The section does not limit creditors or others from using adverse informationthat would be ``obsolete'' under its terms, because it applies only toreporting by consumer reporting agencies. Similarly, this section doesnot bar a creditor's reporting such adverse obsolete information concerningits transactions or experiences with a consumer, because the report wouldnot constitute a consumer report.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Indicating the Existence of Nonspecified, Obsolete Information</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may not furnish a consumer report indicatingthe existence of obsolete adverse information, even if no specific itemis reported. For example, a consumer reporting agency may not communicatethe existence of a debt older than seven years by reporting that a creditgrantor cannot locate a debtor whose debt was charged off ten years ago.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Operative Dates</ITAG>The times or dates set forth in this section, which relate to the occurrenceof events involving adverse information, determine whether the item isobsolete. The date that the consumer reporting agency acquired the adverseinformation is irrelevant to how long that information may be reported.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 605(a)(1)_``Cases under title 11 of the United States Codeor under the Bankruptcy Act that, from the date of entry of the order forrelief or the date of adjudication, as the case may be, antedate the reportby more than 10 years.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Subsections</ITAG>The reporting of suits and judgments is governed by subsection (a)(2),the reporting of accounts placed for collection or charged to profit andloss is governed by subsection (a)(4), and the reporting of other delinquentaccounts is governed by subsection (a)(6). Any such item, even if dischargedin bankruptcy, may be reported separately for the applicable seven yearperiod, while the existence of the bankruptcy filing may be reported forten years.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Wage Earner Plans</ITAG>Wage earner plans may be reported for ten years, because they are coveredby Title 11 of the United States Code.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Date for Filing  </ITAG>A voluntary bankruptcy petition may be reported for ten years from thedate that it is filed, because the filing of the petition constitutes theentry of an ``order for relief'' under this subsection, just like a filingunder the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 301).<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 605(a)(2)_``Suits and judgments which, from date of entry,antedate the report by more than seven years or until the governing statuteof limitations has expired, whichever is the longer period.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Operative Date  </ITAG>For a suit, the term ``date of entry'' means the date the suit was initiated.A protracted suit may be reported for more than seven years from the dateit was entered, if the governing statute of limitations has not expired.For a judgment, the term ``date of entry'' means the date the judgmentwas rendered.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Paid Judgments  </ITAG>Paid judgments cannot be reported for more than seven years after the judgmentwas entered, because payment of the judgment eliminates any ``governingstatute of limitations'' under this subsection that might otherwise lengthenthe period.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 605(a)(3)_``Paid tax liens which, from date of payment, antedatethe report by more than seven years.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Unpaid Liens  </ITAG>If a tax lien (or other lien) remains unsatisfied, it may be reported aslong as it remains filed against the consumer, without limitation, becausethis subsection addresses only paid tax liens.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 605(a)(4)_``Accounts placed for collection or charged to profitand loss which antedate the report by more than seven years.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Placement for Collection  </ITAG>The term ``placed for collection'' means internal collection activity bythe creditor, as well as placement with an outside collector, whicheveroccurs first. Sending of the initial past due notices does not constituteplacement for collection. Placement for collection occurs when dunningnotices or other collection efforts are initiated. The reporting periodis not extended by assignment to another entity for further collection,or by a partial or full payment of the account. However, where a borrowerbrings his delinquent account to date and returns to his regular paymentschedule, and later defaults again, a consumer reporting agency may disregardany collection activity with respect to the first delinquency and measurethe reporting period from the date the account was placed for collectionas a result of the borrower's ultimate default. A consumer's repaymentagreement with a collection agency can be treated as a new account thathas its own seven year period.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Charge to Profit and Loss  </ITAG>The term ``charged to profit and loss'' means action taken by the creditorto write off the account, and the applicable time period is measured fromthat event. If an account that was charged off is later paid in part orpaid in full by the consumer, the reporting period of seven years fromthe charge-off is not extended by this subsequent payment.  <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Reporting of a Delinquent Account That Is Later Placed for Collectionor Charged to Profit and Loss  </ITAG>The fact that an account has been placed for collection or charged to profitand loss may be reported for seven years from the date that either of thoseevents occurs, regardless of the date the account became delinquent. Thefact of delinquency may also be reported for seven years from the datethe account became delinquent.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 605(a)(5)_``Records of arrest, indictment, or conviction ofcrime which, from date of disposition, release, or parole, antedate thereport by more than seven years.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Records  </ITAG>The term ``records'' means any information a consumer reporting agencyhas in its files relating to arrest, indictment or conviction of a crime. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Computation of Time Period  </ITAG>The seven year reporting period runs from the date of disposition, releaseor parole, as applicable. For example, if charges are dismissed, or theconsumer is acquitted, the date of such dismissal or acquittal is the dateof disposition. If the consumer is convicted of a crime and sentenced toconfinement, the date of release or placement on parole controls. (Confinement,whether continuing or resulting from revocation of parole, may be reporteduntil seven years after the confinement is terminated.) The sentencingdate controls for a convicted consumer whose sentence does not includeconfinement. The fact that information concerning the arrest, indictment,or conviction of crime is obtained by the reporting agency at a later datefrom a more recent source (such as a newspaper or interview) does not serveto extend this reporting period.<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 605(a)(6)_``Any other adverse item of information which antedatesthe report by more than seven years.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Subsections  </ITAG>This section applies to all adverse information that is not covered bysection 605(a)(1)-(5). For example, a delinquent account that has neitherbeen placed for collection, nor charged to profit and loss, may be reportedfor seven years from the date of the last regularly scheduled payment.(Accounts placed for collection or charged to profit and loss may be reportedfor the time periods stated in section 605(a)(4).)  <ITAG tagnum="81">2.

Inapplicability to Noninvestigative Consumer Reports</ITAG>The section does not apply to noninvestigative reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Exemptions</ITAG>An employer who orders investigative consumer reports on a current employeewho has not applied for a job change need not notify the employee, becausethe term ``employment purposes'' is defined to include ``promotion, reassignmentor retention'' and subsection (b) provides that the disclosure requirementsdo not apply to ``employment purposes for which the consumer has not specificallyapplied''.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Form and Delivery of Notice</ITAG>The notice must be in writing and delivered to the consumer. The user mayinclude the disclosure in an application for employment, insurance, orcredit, if it is clear and conspicuous and not obscured by other language.A user may send the required notice via first class mail. The notice mustbe mailed or otherwise delivered to the consumer not later than three daysafter the report was first requested.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Content of Notice of Right to Disclosure</ITAG>The notice must clearly and accurately disclose that an ``investigativeconsumer report'' including information as to the consumer's character,general reputation, personal characteristics and mode of living (whicheverare applicable), may be made. The disclosure must also state that an investigativeconsumer report involves personal interviews with sources such as neighbors,friends, or associates. The notice may include any additional, accurateinformation about the report, such as the types of interviews that willbe conducted. The notice must include a statement informing the consumerof the right to request complete and accurate disclosure of the natureand scope of the investigation.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Content of Disclosure of Report</ITAG>When the consumer requests disclosure of the ``nature and scope'' of theinvestigation, such disclosure must include a complete and accurate descriptionof the types of questions asked, the number and types of persons interviewed,and the name and address of the investigating agency. The user need notdisclose the names of sources of information, nor must it provide the dnsumerwith a copy of the report. A report user that provides the consumer witha blank copy of the standardized form used to transmit the report fromthe agency to the user complies with the requirement that it disclose the``nature'' of the investigation.Section 607 Compliance Procedures<ITAG tagnum="20">``(a) Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable proceduesdesigned to avoid violations of section 605 and to limit the furnishingof consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 604.

Every consumer reportingagency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the identity of a new prospectiveuser and the uses certified by such prospective user prior to furnishingsuch user a consumer report. No consumer reporting agency may furnish aconsumer report to any person if it has reasonable grounds for believingthat the consumer report will not be used for a purpose listed in Section604.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(b) Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer reportit shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracyof the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Procedures to Avoid Reporting Obsolete Information</ITAG>A. <T3>General.</T3> A consumer reporting agency should establish procedureswith its sources of adverse information that will avoid the risk of reportingobsolete information. For example, the agency should either require a creditorto supply the date an account was placed for collection or charged off,or the agency should use a conservative date for such placement or chargeoff (such as the date of the last regularly scheduled payment), to be sureof complying with the statute.B. <T3>Retention of obsolete information for reporting in excepted circumstances.</T3>If a consumer reporting agency retains adverse information in itsfiles that is ``obsolete'' under section 605(a) (<T3>e.g., </T3>information about a satisfied judgment that is more thanseven years old), so that it may be reported for use in transactions describedby section 605(b) (<T3>i.e., </T3>applications for credit or life insurance for $50,000 ormore, or employment at an annual salary of $20,000 or more), it must haveprocedural safeguards to avoid reporting the information except in thosesituations. The procedure should require that such obsolete informationbe released only after an internal decision that its release will not violatesection 605.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Procedures to Avoid Reporting for Impermissible Purposes</ITAG>A. <T3>Verification. </T3>A consumer reporting agency should have a systemto verify that it is dealing with a legitimate business having a ``permissiblepurpose'' for the information reported. What constitutes adequate veificationwould vary with the circumstances. If the consumer reporting agency isnot familiar with the use, appropriate procedures might require an on-sitevisit to the user's place of business, or a check of the user's references.B. <T3>Required certification by user. </T3>A consumer reporting agency shouldadopt procedures that require prospective report users to identify themselves,certify the purpose for which the information is sought, and certify thatthe information will be used for no other purpose. A consumer reportingagency should determine initially that users have permissible purposesand ascertain what those purposes are. It should obtain a specific, writtencertification that the recipient will obtain reports for those purposesand no others. The user's certification that the report will be used forno other purposes should expressly prohibit the user from sharing the reportor providing it to anyone else, other than the subject of the report orto a joint user having the same purpose. A consumer reporting agency shouldrefuse to provide reports to those refusing to provide such certification.C. <T3>Blanket or individual certification. </T3>Once the consumer reportingagency obtains a certification from a user (e.g., a creditor) that typicallyhas a permissible purpose for receiving a consumer report, stating thatit will use those reports only for specified permissible purposes (<T3>e.g., </T3>for credit or employment purposes), a certification of purposeneed not be furnished for each individual report obtained, provided thereis no reason to believe the user may be violating its certification. However,in furnishing reports to users that typically could have both permissibleand impermissible purposes for ordering consumer reports (<T3>e.g., </T3>attorneys and detective agencies), the consumer reportingagency must require the user to provide a separate certification each timeit requests a consumer report.D. <T3>Procedures to avoid recipients' abuse of certification. </T3>When doubtarises concerning any user's compliance with its contractual certification,a consumer reporting agency must take steps to insure compliance, suchas requiring a separate, advance certification for each report it furnishesthat user, or auditing that user to verify that it is obtaining reportsonly for permissible purposes. A consumer reporting agency must cease furnishingconsumer reports to users who repeatedly request consumer reports for impermissiblepurposes.E. <T3>Unauthorized access. </T3>A consumer reporting agency should take severalother steps when doubt arises concerning whether a user is obtaining reportsfor a permissible purpose from a computerized system. If it appears thata third party, not a subscriber, has obtained unauthorized access to thesystem, the consumer reporting agency should take appropriate steps suchas altering authorized users' means of access, such as codes and passwords,and making random checks to ensure that future reports are obtained onlyfor permissible purposes. If a subscriber has inadvertently sought reportsfor impermissible purposes or its employee has obtained reports withouta permissible purpose, it would be appropriate for the consumer reportingagency to alter the subscriber's means of access, and require an individualwritten certification of the permissible purpose for each report requestedor randomly verify such purposes. A consumer reporting agency should refuseto furnish any further reports to a user that repeatedly violates certifications.F. <T3>Use of computerized systems. </T3>A consumer reporting agency may furnishconsumer reports to users via terminals, provided the consumer reportingagency includes in its contract with users, a statement that each attemptto access a consumer report via a terminal constitutes a certificationof a permissible purpose. (The agency would have to record the identityof consumer report recipients for each consumer, to be able to make anydisclosures required under section 609(a)(3) or section 611(d)).G. <T3>Activity reports. </T3>If a consumer reporting agency provides ``activityreports'' on all customers who have open-end accounts with a credit grantor,it must make certain that the credit grantor always notifies the agencywhen accounts are closed, to avoid furnishing reports on former customersor other customers for whom the credit grantor lacks a permissible purpose.(See also discussion in section 604(3)(A), item 1, <T3>supra.</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Reasonable Procedures to Assure Maximum Possible Accuracy</ITAG>A. <T3>General. </T3>The section does not require error free consumer reports.If a consumer reporting agency accurately transcribes, stores and communicatesconsumer information received from a source that it reasonably believesto be reputable, and which is credible on its face, the agency does notviolate this section simply by reporting an item of information that turnsout to be inaccurate. However, when a consumer reporting agency learnsor should reasonably be aware of errors in its reports that may indicatesystematic problems (by virtue of information from consumers, report users,from periodic review of its reporting system, or otherwise) it must reviewits procedures for assuring accuracy. Examples of errors that would requiresuch review are the issuance of a consumer report pertaining entirely toa consumer other than the one on whom a report was requested, and the issuanceof a consumer report containing information on two or more consumers (<T3>e.g., </T3>information that was mixed in the file) in response to arequest for a report on only one of those consumers.B. <T3>Required steps to improve accuracy. </T3>If the agency's review ofits procedures reveals, or the agency should reasonably be aware of, stepsit can take to improve the accuracy of its reports at a reasonable cost,it must take any such steps. It should correct inaccuracies that come toits attention. A consumer reporting agency must also adopt reasonable proceduresto eliminate systematic errors that it knows about, or should reasonablybe aware of, resulting from procedures followed by its sources of information.For example, if a particular credit grantor has often furnished a significantamount of erroneous consumer account information, the agency must requirethe creditor to revise its procedures to correct whatever problems causethe errors or stop reporting information from that creditor.C. <T3>Use of automatic data processing equipment. </T3>Consumer reportingagencies that use automatic data processing equipment (particularly forlong distance transmission of information) should have procedures to assurethat the data is accurately converted into a machine-readable format andnot distorted by machine malfunction or transmission failure. Securityprocedures must be adopted to control the possibility that computerizedconsumer information will be stolen or altered by either authorized orunauthorized users of the information system.D. <T3>Reliability of sources</T3>. Whether a consumer reporting agency mayrely on the accuracy of information from a source depends on the circumstances.This section does not hold a consumer reporting agency responsible wherean item of information that it receives from a source that it reasonablybelieves to be reputable appears credible on its face, and is transcribed,stored and communicated as provided by that source. Requirements are morestringent where the information furnished appears implausible or inconsistent,or where procedures for furnishing it seem likely to result in inaccuracies,or where the consumer reporting agency has had numerous problems regardinginformation from a particular source.E. <T3>Undesignated information in credit transactions</T3>. ``Undesignatedinformation'' means all credit history information in a married (or formerlymarried) consumer's file, which was not reported to the consumer reportingagency with a designation indicating that the information relates to eitherthe consumer's joint or individual credit experience. The question ariseswhat is meant by reasonable procedures under this section for treatmentof credit history in the file of only one (present or former) spouse (usuallythe husband) that has not been designated by the procedure in RegulationB, 12 CFR 202.10, which implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. (Thissituation exists only for certain credit history file information compiledbefore June 1, 1977, and certain accounts opened before that date.) A consumerreporting agency may report information solely in the file of spouse A,when spouse B applies for a separate extension of credit, only if suchinformation relates to accounts for which spouse B was either a user orwas contractually liable, or the report recipient has a permissible purposefor a report on spouse A. A consumer reporting agency may not supply allundesignated information from the file of a consumer's spouse in responseto a request for a report on the consumer, because some or all of thatinformation may not relate to both spouses. Consumer reporting agenciesmust honor without charge the request of a married or formerly marriedindividual that undesignated information (that appears only in the filesof the individual's present or former spouse) be segregated_<T3>i.e.,</T3> placed in a separate file that is accessible under thatindividual's name. This procedure insures greater accuracy and protectionof the privacy of spouses than does the automatic reporting of undesignatedinformation.F. <T3>Reporting of credit obligation</T3>_(1) <T3>Past due accounts</T3>. A consumer reporting agency must employ reasonableprocedures to keep its file current on past due accounts (<T3>e.g.,</T3> by requiring its creditors to notify the credit bureau whena previously past due account has been paid or discharged in bankruptcy),but its failure to show such activity in particular instances, despitethe maintenance of reasonable procedures to keep files current, does notviolate this section. For example, a consumer reporting agency that reportsaccurately in 1985 that as of 1983 the consumer owed a retail store money,without mentioning that the consumer eventually paid the debt, does notviolate this section if it was not informed by the store or the consumerof the later payment.(2) <T3>Significant, verified information</T3>. A consumer reporting agencymust report significant, verified information it possesses about an item.For instance, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report a paidaccount that was previously delinquent, but should also report that theaccount has been paid. Similarly, a consumer reporting agency may includedelinquencies on debts discharged in bankruptcy in consumer reports, butmust accurately note the status of the debt (<T3>e.g.,</T3> discharged, voluntarily repaid). Finally, if a reportedbankruptcy has been dismissed, that fact should be reported.(3) <T3>Guarantor obligations.</T3> Personal guarantees for obligations incurredby others (including a corporation) may be included in a consumer reporton the individual who is the guarantor. The report should accurately reflectthe individual's involvement (<T3>e.g.</T3>, as guarantor of the corporate debt).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Effect of Criminal Sanctions</ITAG>Notwithstanding the fact that section 619 provides criminal sanctions againstpersons who knowingly and willfully obtain information on a consumer froma consumer reporting agency under false, pretenses, a consumer reportingagency must follow reasonable procedures to limit the furnishing of reportsto those with permissible purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Disclosure of Credit Denial</ITAG>When reporting that a consumer was denied a benefit (such as credit), aconsumer reporting agency need not report the reasons for the denial.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Content of Report</ITAG>A consumer report need not be tailored to the user's needs. It may containany information that is complete, accurate, and not obsolete on the consumerwho is the subject of the report.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Completeness of Reports</ITAG>Consumer reporting agencies are not required to include all existing derogatoryor favorable information about a consumer in their reports. (See, however,discussion in section 611, item 14, <T3>infra</T3>, concerning conveying consumer dispute statements.) However,a consumer reporting agency may not mislead its subscribers as to the completenessof its reports by deleting nonderogatory information and not disclosingits policy of making such deletions.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. User Notice of Adverse Action Based on a Consumer Report</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency need not require users of its consumer reportsto provide any notice to consumers against whom adverse action is takenbased on a consumer report. The FCRA imposes such notice requirements directlyon users, under the circumstances set out in section 615.Section 608 Disclosures to Governmental Agencies<ITAG tagnum="20">``Notwithstanding the provisions of section 604, a consumer reportingagency may furnish identifying information respecting any consumer limitedto his name, address, former addresses, places of employment, or formerplaces of employment, to a governmental agency.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>Because a report containing only a consumer's name and address is not a``consumer report'' as defined in section 603(d), a consumer reportingagency may provide this identifying information to any party notwithstandingthe provisions of sections 604 and 608. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Permissible Purpose Necessary for Additional Information</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may furnish limited identifying informationconcerning a consumer to a governmental agency (<T3>e.g., </T3> an agency seeking a fugitive from justice) even if thatagency does not have a ``permissible purpose'' under section 604 to receivea consumer report. However, a governmental agency must have a permissiblepurpose in order to obtain information beyond what is authorized by thissection. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Entities Covered by Section</ITAG>The term ``governmental agency'' includes federal, state, county and municipalagencies, and grand juries. Only governmental agencies may obtain disclosuresof identifying information under this section. Section 609 Disclosures to Consumers<ITAG tagnum="20">``(a) Every consumer reporting agency shall, upon request and properidentification of any consumer, clearly and accurately disclose to theconsumer:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(1) The nature and substance of all information (except medical information)in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(2) The sources of the information; except that the sources of informationacquired solely for use in preparing an investigative consumer report andactually used for no other purpose need not be disclosed: Provided, Thatin the event an action is brought under this title, such sources shallbe available to the plaintiff under appropriate discovery procedures inthe court in which the action is brought.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(3) The recipients of any consumer report on the consumer which ithas furnished</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(A) for employment purposes within the two-year period preceding therequest, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(B) for any other purpose within the six-month period preceding therequest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(b) The requirements of subsection (a) respecting the disclosure ofsources of information and the recipients of consumer reports do not applyto information received or consumer reports furnished prior to the effectivedate of this title except to the extent that the matter involved is containedin the files of the consumer reporting agency on that date.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>This section states what consumer reporting agencies must disclose to consumers,upon request and proper identification. Section 610 sets forth the conditionunder which those disclosures must be made, and section 612 sets forththe circumstances under which consumer reporting agencies may charge formaking such disclosures. The term ``file'' as used in section 609(a)(1)is defined in section 603(g). The term ``investigative consumer report,''which is used in section 609(a)(2), is defined in section 603(e). The term``medical information,'' which is used in section 609(a)(1), is definedin section 603(i). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proper Identification</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency must take reasonable steps to verify the identifyof an individual seeking disclosure under this section. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Manner of ``Proper Identification''</ITAG>If a consumer provides sufficient identifying information, the consumerreporting agency cannot insist that the consumer execute a ``request forinterview'' form, or provide the items listed on it, as a prerequisiteto disclosure. However, the agency may use a form to identify consumersrequesting disclosure if it does not use the form to seek or obtain anywaiver of the consumers' rights. A consumer reporting agency may providedisclosure by telephone without a written request, if the consumer is properlyidentified, but may insist on a written request before providing such disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Power of Attorney</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency must disclose a consumer's file to a thirdparty authorized by the consumer's written power of attorney to obtainthe disclosure, if the third party presents adequate identification andfulfills other applicable conditions of disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Nature of Disclosure Required</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency must disclose the nature and substance of allitems in the consumer's file, no matter how or where they are stored (<T3>e.g.,</T3> in other offices of the consumer reporting agency). Theconsumer reporting agency must have personnel trained to explain to theconsumer any information furnished in accordance with the Act. Particularlywhen the file includes coded information that would be meaningless to theconsumer, the agency's personnel must assist the consumer to understandthe disclosures. Any summary must not mischaracterize the nature of anyitem of information in the file. The consumer reporting agency is not requiredto provide a copy of the file, or any other written disclosure, or to readthe file verbatim to the consumer or to permit the consumer to examineany information in its files. A consumer reporting agency may choose tocomply with the Act in writing, by providing a copy of the file to theconsumer or otherwise.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Medical Information</ITAG>Medical information includes information obtained with the consumer's consentfrom physicians and medical facilities, but does not include comments ona consumer's health by non-medical personnel. A consumer reporting agencyis not required to disclose medical information in its files to consumers,but may do so. Alternatively, a consumer reporting agency may inform consumersthat there is medical information in the files concerning them and supplythe name of the doctor or other source of the information. Consumer reportingagencies may also disclose such information to a physician of the consumer'schoice, upon the consumer's written instructions pursuant to section 604(2).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Ancillary Information</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency is not required to disclose information consistingof an audit trail of changes it makes in the consumer's file, billing records,or the contents of a consumer relations folder, if the information is notfrom consumer reports and will not be used in preparing future consumerreports. Such data is not included in the term ``information in its files''which must be disclosed to the consumer pursuant to this section. A consumerreporting agency must disclose claims report information only if it hasappeared in consumer reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Information on Other Consumers</ITAG>The consumer has no right to information in the consumer reporting agency'sfiles on other individuals, because the disclosure must be limited to information``on the consumer.'' However, all information in the files of the consumermaking the request must be disclosed, including information about anotherindividual (<T3>e.g.,</T3> concerning that individual's dealings with the subject ofthe consumer report).<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Disclosure of Sources of Information</ITAG>Consumer reporting agencies must disclose the sources of information, exceptfor sources of information acquired solely for use in preparing an investigativeconsumer report and actually used for no other purpose. When it has usedinformation from another consumer reporting agency, the other agency shouldbe reported as a source.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Disclosure of Recipients of Consumer Reports</ITAG>Consumer reporting agencies must maintain records of recipients of priorconsumer reports sufficient to enable them to meet the FCRA's requirementsthat they disclose the identity of recipients of prior consumer reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Disclosure of Recipients of Prescreened Lists</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency must furnish to a consumer requesting filedisclosure the identity of recipients of any prescreened lists that containedthe disclosure's name when submitted by creditors (or other users) to theconsumer reporting agency.Section 610 Conditions of Disclosure<ITAG tagnum="20">``(a) A consumer reporting agency shall make the disclosures requiredunder section 609 during normal business hours and on reasonable notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(b) The disclosures required under section 609 shall be made to theconsumer_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(1) in person if he appears in person and furnishes proper identification;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(2) by telephone if he has made a written request, with proper identification,for telephone disclosure and the toll charge, if any, for the telephonecall is prepaid by or charged directly to the consumer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(c) Any consumer reporting agency shall provide trained personnelto explain to the consumer any information furnished to him pursuant tosection 609.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(d) The consumer shall be permitted to be accompanied by one otherperson of his choosing, who shall furnish reasonable identification. Aconsumer reporting agency may require the consumer to furnish a writtenstatement granting permission to the consumer reporting agency to discussthe consumer's file in such person's presence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(e) Except as provided in sections 616 and 617, no consumer may bringany action or proceeding in the nature of defamation, invasion of privacy,or negligence with respect to the reporting of information against anyconsumer reporting agency, any user of information or any person who furnishesinformation to a consumer reporting agency, based on information disclosedpursuant to section 609, 610, or 615, except as to false information furnishedwith malice or willful intent to injure such consumers.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Time of Disclosure</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency must take disclosures during normal businesshours, upon reasonable notice. However, the consumer reporting agency maywaive reasonable notice, and the consumer may agree to disclosure outsideof normal business hours.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Extra Conditions Prohibited</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may not add conditions not set out in the FCRAas a prerequisite to the required disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Manner of Disclosure</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may, with the consumer's actual or impliedconsent, meet its disclosure obligations by mail, in lieu of the in-personor telephone disclosures specified in the statute.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Disclosure in the Presence of Third Parties </ITAG>When the consumer requests disclosure in a third party's presence, theconsumer reporting agency may require that a consumer sign an authorizationbefore such disclosure is made. The consumer may choose the third partyto accompany him or her for the disclosure. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Expense of Telephone Calls </ITAG>A consumer reporting agency is not required to pay the telephone chargefor a telephone interview with a consumer obtaining disclosure. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Qualified Defamation Privilege </ITAG>The privilege extended by subsection 610(e) does not apply to an actionbrought by a consumer if the action is based on information not disclosedpursuant to sections 609, 610 or 615. A disclosure to a consumer's representative(<T3>e.g.</T3>, based on the consumer's power of attorney) constitutes ``informationdisclosed pursuant to section 609'' and is thus covered by this privilege.Section 611 Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy <ITAG tagnum="20">``(a) If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information containedin his file is disputed by a consumer, and such dispute is directly conveyedto the consumer reporting agency by the consumer, the consumer reportingagency shall within a reasonable period of time reinvestigate and recordthe current status of that information unless it has reasonable groundsto believe that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant.If after such reinvestigation such information is found to be inaccurateor can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall promptlydelete such information. The presence of contradictory information in theconsumer's file does not in and of itself constitute reasonable groundsfor believing the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(b) If the reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute, the consumermay file a brief statement setting forth the nature of the dispute. Theconsumer reporting agency may limit such statements to not more than onehundred words if it provides the consumer with assistance in writing aclear summary of the dispute. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(c) Whenever a statement of a dispute is filed, unless there is reasonablegrounds to believe that it is frivolous or irrelevant, the consumer reportingagency shall, in any subsequent consumer report containing the informationin question, clearly note that it is disputed by the consumer and provideeither the consumer's statement or a clear and accurate codification orsummary thereof. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(d) Following any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurateor whose accuracy can no longer be verified or any notation as to disputedinformation, the consumer reporting agency shall, at the request of theconsumer, furnish notification that the item has been deleted or the statement,codification or summary pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) to any personspecifically designated by the consumer who has within two years priorthereto received a consumer report for employment purposes, or within sixmonths prior thereto received a consumer report for any other purpose,which contained the deleted or disputed information. The consumer reportingagency shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the consumer his rightsto make such a request. Such disclosure shall be made at or prior to thetime the information is deleted or the consumer's statement regarding thedisputed information is received.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections </ITAG>This section sets forth procedures consumer reporting agencies must followif a consumer conveys a dispute of the completeness or accuracy of anyitem of information to the consumer reporting agency. Section 609 providesfor disclosures by consumer reporting agencies to consumers, and section610 sets forth conditions of disclosure. Section 612 permits a consumerreporting agency to impose charges for certain disclosures, including thefurnishing of certain information to recipients of prior reports, as providedby section 611(d). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proper Reinvestigation </ITAG>A consumer reporting agency conducting a reinvestigation must make a goodfaith effort to determine the accuracy of the disputed item or items. Ata minimum, it must check with the original sources or other reliable sourcesof the disputed information and inform them of the nature of the consumer'sdispute. In reinvestigating and attempting to verify a disputed credittransaction, a consumer reporting agency may rely on the accuracy of acreditor's ledger sheets and need not require the creditor to produce documentationsuch as the actual signed sales slips. Reinvestigation and verificationmay require more than asking the original source of the disputed informationthe same question and receiving the same answer. If the original sourceis contacted for reinvestigation, the consumer reporting agency shouldat least explain to the source that the original statement has been disputed,state the consumer's position, and then ask whether the source would confirmthe information, qualify it, or accept the consumer's explanation. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Complaint of Insufficient File, or Lack of File </ITAG>The FCRA does not require a consumer reporting agency to add new itemsof information to its file. A consumer reporting agency is not requiredto create new files on consumers for whom it has no file, nor is it requiredto add new lines of information about new accounts not reflected in anexisting file, because the section permits the consumer to dispute onlythe completeness or accuracy of particular items of information in thefile. If a consumer reporting agency chooses to add lines of informationat the consumer's request, it may charge a fee for doing so. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Explanation of Extenuating Circumstances </ITAG>A consumer reporting agency has no duty to reinvestigate, or take any otheraction under this section, if a consumer merely provides a reason for afailure to pay a debt (<T3>e.g.,</T3> sudden illness or layoff), and does not challenge the accuracyor completeness of the item of information in the file relating to a debt.Most creditors are aware that a variety of circumstances may render consumersunable to repay credit obligations. Although a consumer reporting agencyis not required to accept a consumer dispute statement that does not challengethe accuracy or completeness of an item in the consumer's file, it mayaccept such a statement and may charge a fee for doing so. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Reinvestigation of a Debt </ITAG>A consumer reporting agency must reinvestigate if a consumer conveys toit a dispute concerning the validity or status of a debt, such as whetherthe debt was owed by the consumer, or whether the debt had subsequentlybeen paid. For example, if a consumer alleges that a judgment reflectedin the file as unpaid has been satisfied, or notifies a consumer reportingagency that a past due obligation reflected in the file as unpaid was subsequentlypaid, the consumer reporting agency must reinvestigate the matter. If afile reflects a debt discharged in bankruptcy without reflecting subsequentreaffirmation and payment of that debt, a consumer may require that theitem be reinvestigated. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Status of a Debt </ITAG>The consumer reporting agency must, upon reinvestigation, ``record thecurrent status'' of the disputed item. This requires inclusion of any informationrelating to a change in status of an ongoing matter (<T3>e.g.,</T3> that a debt shown as past due had subsequently been paidor discharged in bankruptcy, or that a debt shown as discharged in bankruptcywas later reaffirmed and/or paid). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Dispute Conveyed to Party Other Than the Consumer Reporting Agency</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency is required to take action under this sectiononly if the consumer directly communicates a dispute to it. It is not requiredto respond to a dispute of information that the consumer merely conveysto others (<T3>e.g.,</T3> to a source of information). But see, however, discussionin section 607, item 3A, of consumer reporting agencies' duties to correcterrors that come to their attention.) <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Dispute Conveyed to the Consumer Reporting Agency by a Party OtherThan the Consumer </ITAG>A consumer reporting agency need not reinvestigate a dispute about a consumer'sfile raised by any third party, because the obligation under the sectionarises only where an ``item of information in his file is disputed by theconsumer.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Consumer Disclosures and Adverse Action Not Prerequisites to ReinvestigationDuty </ITAG>A consumer reporting agency's obligation to reinvestigate disputed itemsis not contingent upon the consumer's having been denied a benefit or havingasserted any rights under the FCRA other than disputing items of information.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Reasonable Period of Time </ITAG>A consumer reporting agency is required to reinvestigate and record thecurrent status of disputed information within a reasonable period of timeafter the consumer conveys the dispute to it. An appropriate yardstickof what is ``reasonable'' may be how long it would take to reinvestigatethe same matter if it were brought to the consumer reporting agency's attentionby one of its customers. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Frivolous or Irrelevant </ITAG>The mere presence of contradictory information in the file does not providethe consumer reporting agency ``reasonable grounds to believe that thedispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant.'' A consumer reportingagency must assume a consumer's dispute is bona fide, unless there is clearand convincing evidence to the contrary. Such evidence may constitute receiptof letters from consumers disputing all information in their files withoutproviding any allegations concerning the specific items in the files. Theagency is not required to repeat a reinvestigation that it has just conductedsimply because the consumer reiterates a dispute about the same item ofinformation. <ITAG tagnum="81">12. Deletion of Accurate Information That has not Been Disputed</ITAG>The consumer reporting agency is not required to delete accurate informationthat would not be verified upon reinvestigation, if it has not been ``disputedby a consumer.'' For example, if a creditor deletes adverse informationfrom its files with the result that informaion could not be reverifiedif disputed, it is still permissible for a consumer reporting agency toreport it (subject to the obsolescence provisions of section 605) untilit is disputed.<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Consumer Dispute Statements on Multiple Items</ITAG>A consumer who disputes mulitiple items of information in his file mayinsert a one hundred word statement as to each disputed item.<ITAG tagnum="81">14. Conveying Dispute Statements to recipients of Subsequent Reports</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may not merely tell the recipient of a subsequentreport containing disputed information that the consumer's statement ison file but will be provided only if requested, because subsection (c)requires the agency to provide either the statement or ``a clear and accuratecodification or summary thereof.''Section 612 Charges for Certain Disclosures<ITAG tagnum="20">``A consumer reporting agency shall make all disclosures pursuantto section 609 and furnish all consumer reports pursuant to section 611(d)without charge to the consumer if, within thirty days after receipt bysuch consumer of a notification pursuant to section 615 or notificationfrom a debt collection agency affiliated with such consumer reporting agencystating that the consumer's credit rating may be or has been adverselyaffected, the consumer makes a request under section 609 or 611(d). Otherwise,the consumer for making disclosure to such consumer pursuant to section609, the charge for which shall be indicated to the consumer prior to makingdisclosure; and for furnishing notifications, statements, summaries,orcodifications to persons designated by the consumer pursuant to section611(d), the charge for which shall be indicated to the consumer prior tofurnishing such information and shall not exceed the charge that the consumerreporting agency would impose on each designated recipient for a consumerreport except that no charge may be made for notifying such persons ofthe deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or which canno longer be verified.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Irrelevance of Subsequent Grant of Credit or Reason for Denial</ITAG>A consumer denied credit because of a consumer report has the right tofree disclosure within 30 days of receipt of the section 615(a) notice,even if credit was subsequently granted or the basis of the denial wasthat the references supplied by the consumer are too few or too new toappear in the credit file.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Charge for Investigation Prohibited</ITAG>This section does not permit consumer reporting agencies to charge formaking the reinvestigation or following other procedures required by section611(a)-(c).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Permissible Charges for Services Requested by Consumers</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may charge fees for creating files on consumersat their request, or for other services not required by the FCRA that arerequested by consumers.Section 613 Public Record Information for Employment Purposes<ITAG tagnum="20">``A consumer reporting agency which furnishes a consumer report foremployment purposes and which for that purpose compiles and reports itemsof information on consumers which are matters of public record and arelikely to have an adverse effect upon a consumer's ability to obtain employmentshall_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(1) at the time such public record information is reported to theuser of such consumer report, notify the consumer of the fact that publicrecord information is being reported by the consumer reporting agency,together with the name and address of the person to whom such informationis being reported; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(2) maintain strict procedures designed to insure that whenever publicrecord information which is likely to have an adverse effect on a consumer'sability to obtain employment is reported it is complete and up to date.For purposes of this paragraph, items of public record relating to arrests,indictments, convictions, suits, tax liens, and outstanding judgments shallbe considered up to date if the current public record status of the itemat the time of the report is reported.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency that complies with section 613(1) must alsofollow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy, as requiredby section 607(b).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Alternate Methods of Compliance</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency that furnishes public record information foremployment purposes must comply with either subsection (1) or (2), butneed not comply with both.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Information From Another Consumer Reporting Agency</ITAG>If a consumer reporting agency uses information or reports from other consumerreporting agencies in a report for employment purposes, it must complywith this section.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Method of Providing Notice</ITAG>A consumer reporting agency may use first class mail to provide the noticerequired by subsection (1).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Waiver</ITAG>The procedures required by this section cannot be waived by the consumerto whom the report relates.Section 614 Restrictions on Investigative Consumer Reports<ITAG tagnum="20">``Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares an investigative consumerreport, no adverse information in the consumer report (other than informationwhich is a matter of public record) may be included in a subsequent consumerreport unless such adverse information report, or the adverse informationwas received within the three-month period preceding the date the subsequentreport is furnished.''</ITAG>Section 615 Requirements on Users of ConsumerReports<ITAG tagnum="20">``(a) Whenever credit or insurance for personal, family, or householdpurposes, or employment involving a consumer is denied or the charge forsuch credit or insurance is increased either wholly or partly because ofinformation contained in a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency,the user of the consumer report shall so advise the consumer against whomsuch adverse action has been taken and supply the name and address of theconsumer reporting agency making the report.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">``(b) Whenever credit for personal, family, or household purposesinvolving a consumer is denied or the charge for such credit is increasedeither wholly or partly because of information obtained from a person otherthan a consumer reporting agency bearing upon the consumer's credit worthiness,credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personalcharacteristics, or mode of living, the user of such information shall,within a reasonable period of time, upon the consumer's written requestfor the reasons for such adverse action received within 60 days after learningof such adverse action, disclose the nature of the information to the consumer.The user of such information shall clearly and accurately disclose to theconsumer his right to make such written request at the time such adverseaction is communicated to the consumer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">``(c) No person shall be held liable for any violation of this sectionif he shows by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time of thealleged violation he maintained reasonable procedures to assure compliancewith the provisions of subsections (a) and (b).''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections and Regulation B</ITAG>Sections 606 and 615 are the only two sections that require users of reportsto make disclosures to consumers. Section 606 applies only to users of``investigative consumer reports.'' Creditors should not confuse compliancewith section 615(a), which only requires disclosure of the name and addressof the consumer reporting agency, and compliance with the Equal CreditOpportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. 1691 <T3>et seq. </T3>and Regulation B, 12 CFR Part 202, which require disclosureof the <T3>reasons </T3>for adverse action. Compliance with section 615(a), therefore,does not constitute compliance with Regulation B.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Limited Scope of Requirements</ITAG>The section does not require that creditors disclose their credit criteriaor standards or that employers furnish copies of personnel files to formeremployees. The section does not require that the user provide any kindof advance notification to consumers before a consumer report is obtained.(See section 606 regarding notice of investigative consumer reports.)<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Method of Disclosure</ITAG>The disclosures required by this section need not be made in writing. However,users will have evidence that they have taken reasonable steps to complywith this section if they provide written disclosures and retain copiesfor at least two years, the applicable statute of limitations for mostcivil liability actions under the FCRA.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Adverse Action Based on Direct Information</ITAG>This section does not require that a user send any notice to a consumerconcerning adverse action regarding that consumer that is based neitheron information from a consumer reporting agency nor on information froma third party. For example, no disclosures are required concerning adverseaction based on information provided by the consumer in an applicationor based on past experience in direct transaction with the consumer.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Creditors Using ``Prescreened'' Mailing Lists</ITAG>A creditor is not required to provide notices regarding consumer reportingagencies that prepare mailing lists by ``prescreening'' because they donot involve consumer requests for credit and credit has not been deniedto consumers whose names are deleted from a list furnished to the agencyfor use in this procedure. See discussion of ``prescreening,'' under section604(3)(A), item 6, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">6. Applicability to Users of Motor Vehicle Reports</ITAG>An insurer that refuses to issue a policy, or charges a higher than normalpremium, based on a motor vehicle report is required to comply with subsection(a).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Securities and Insurance Transactions</ITAG>A consumer report user that denies credit to a consumer in connection witha securities transaction must provide the required notice, because thedenial is of ``credit * * * for personal purposes,'' unless the consumerengages in such transactions as a business.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Denial of Employment</ITAG>An employer must provide the notice required by subsection (a) to an individualwho has applied for employment and has been rejected based on a consumerreport. However, an employer is not required to send a notice when it decidesnot to offer a position to an individual who has not applied for it, becausein this case employment is not ``denied.'' (See discussion in section 606,item 4, <T3>supra.</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Adverse Action Involving Credit</ITAG>A creditor must provide the required notice when it denies the consumer'srequest for credit (including a rejection based on a scoring system, wherea credit report received less than the maximum number of points possibleand caused the application to receive an insufficient score), denies theconsumer's request for increased credit, grants credit in an amount lessthan the consumer requested, or raises the charge for credit.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Adverse Action Not Involving Credit, Insurance or Employment</ITAG>The Act does not require that a report user provide any notice to consumerswhen taking adverse action not relating to credit, insurance or employment.For example, a landlord who refuses to rent an apartment to a consumerbased on credit or other information in a consumer report need not providethe notice. Similarly, a party that uses credit or other information ina consumer report as a basis for refusing to accept payment by check neednot comply with this section. Checks have historically been treated ascash items, and thus such refusal does not involve a denial of credit,insurance or employment. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Adverse Action Based on Non-derogatory Adverse Information </ITAG>A party taking adverse action concerning credit or insurance or denyingemployment, ``wholly or partly because of information contained in a consumerreport,'' must provide the required notice, even if the information isnot derogatory. For example, the user must give the notice if the denialis based wholly or party on the absence of a file or on the fact that thefile contained insufficient references. <ITAG tagnum="81">12. Name and Address of the Consumer Report Agency </ITAG>The ``section 615(a)'' notice must include the consumer reporting agency'sstreet address, not just a post office box address. <ITAG tagnum="81">13. Agency To Be Idenfified</ITAG>The consumer report user should provide the name and address of the consumerreporting agency from which it obtained the consumer report, even if thatagency obtained all or part of the report from another agency. <ITAG tagnum="81">14. Denial Based Partly on a Consumer Report </ITAG>A ``section 615(a)'' notice must be sent even if the adverse action isbased only partly on a consumer report. <ITAG tagnum="81">15. Denial of Credit Based on Information From ``Third Parties.''</ITAG>Subsection (b) imposes requirements on a creditor when it denies (or increasethe charge for) credit for personal, family or household purposes involvinga consumer, based on information from a ``third party'' source, which meansa source <T3>other</T3> than the consumer reporting agency, the creditor's own files,or the consumer's application (<T3>e.g.,</T3> creditor, employer, or landlord). Where a creditor deniesa consumer's application based on information obtained directly from anotherlender, even if the lender's name was furnised to the creditor by a consumerreporting agency, the creditor must give a ``third party'' disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="81">16. Substance of Required ``Third Party'' Disclosures </ITAG>When adverse action is communicated to the consumer, the creditor mustclearly and accurately disclose to the consumer his or her right to makea written request for the disclsoure of the nature of the third party informationthat led to the adverse action. Upon timely receipt of such a request,however, the creditor need disclose only the nature of the informationthat led to the adverse action (<T3>e.g.,</T3> history of late rent payments or bad checks) and not thecriteria that led to the adverse action. A creditor may comply with subsection(b) by providing a statement of the nature of the third party informationthat led to the denial when it notifies the consumer of the denial. A statementof principal, specific reasons for adverse action based on third partyinformation that is sufficient to comply with the requirements of the EqualCredit Opportunity Act (<T3>e.g.,</T3> ``unable to verify employment'') is sufficient to constitutedisclosurer of the ``nature of the information'' under subsection (b). Section 616 Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance <ITAG tagnum="20">Section 616 permits consumers who sue and prove willful noncompliancewith the Act to recover actual damages, punitive damages, and the costsof the action, together with reasonable attorney's fees. </ITAG>Section617 Civil Liability for Negligent Noncompliance <ITAG tagnum="20">Section 617 permits consumers who sue and prove negligent noncompliancewith the Act to recover actual damages and the costs of the action, togetherwith reasonable attorney's fees. </ITAG>Section 618 Jurisdiction of Courts;Limitation of Actions<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 618 provides that any action brought under section 616 orsection 617 may be brought in any United States district court or othercourt of competent jurisdiction. Such suit must be brought within two yearsfrom the date on which liability arises, unless a defendant has materiallyand willfully misrepresented information the Act requires to be disclosed,and the information misrepresented is material to establishment of thedefendant's liability. In that event, the action must be brought withintwo years after the individual discovers the misrepresentation.</ITAG>Section619 Obtaining Information Under False Pretense<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 619 provides criminal sanctions against any person who knowinglyand willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reportingagency under false pretenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relation to Other Sections</ITAG>The presence of this provision does not excuse a consumer reporting agency'sfailure to follow reasonable procedures, as required by section 607(a),to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed undersection 604.Section 620 Unauthorized Disclosures by Officers or Employees<ITAG tagnum="20">Section 620 provides criminal sanctions against any officer or employeeof a consumer reporting agency who knowingly and willfully provides informationconerning an individual from the agency's file to a person not authorizedto receive it.</ITAG>Section 621 Administrative Enforcement<ITAG tagnum="20">This section gives the Federal Trade Commission authority to enforcethe Act with respect to consumer reporting agencies, users of reports,and all others, except to the extent that it gives enforcement jurisdictionspecifically to some other agency. Those excepted from the Commission'senforcement jurisdiction include certain financial institutions regulatedby Federal agencies or boards, Federal credit unions, common carriers subjectto acts to regulate commerce, air carriers, and parties subject to thePackers and Stockyards Act, 1921.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. General</ITAG>The Commission can use its cease-and-desist power and other procedural,investigative and enforcement powers which it has under the FTC Act tosecure compliance, irrespective of commerce or any other jurisdictionaltests in the FTC Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Geographic Coverage</ITAG>The Commission's authority encompasses the United States, the Districtof Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and all United States territoriesbut does not extend to activities outside those areas.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Status of Commission Commentary and Staff Interpretations</ITAG>The FCRA does not give any Federal agency authority to promulgate ruleshaving the force and effect of statutory provisions. The Commission hasissued this Commentary, superseding the eight formal Interpretations ofthe Act (16 CFR 600.1-600.8), previously issued pursuant to andSection;1.73of the Commission's Rules, 16 CFR 1.73. The Commentary does not constitutesubstantive rules and does not have the force or effect of statutory provisions.It constitutes guidelines to clarify the Act that are advisory in natureand represent the Commission's views as to what particular provisions ofthe Act mean. Staff opinion letters constitute staff interpretations ofthe Act's provisions, but do not have the force or effect of statutoryprovisions and, as provided in andSection;1.72 of the Commission's Rules,16 CFR 1.72, do not bind the Commission.Section 622 Relation to State Laws<ITAG tagnum="20">``This title does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subjectto the provisions of this title from complying with the laws of any Statewith respect to the collection, distribution, or use of any informationon consumers, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent withany provision of this title, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Basic Rule</ITAG>State law is pre-empted by the FCRA only when compliance with inconsistentstate law would result in violation of the FCRA.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Examples of Statutes that are not Pre-empted</ITAG>A state law requirement that an employer provide notice to a consumer beforeordering a consumer report, or that a consumer reporting agency must providethe consumer with a written copy of his file, would not be pre-empted,because a party that complies with such provisions would not violate theFCRA.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Examples of Statutes that are Pre-empted</ITAG>A state law authorizing grand juries to compel consumer reporting agenciesto provide consumer reports, by means of subpoenas signed by a court clerk,is pre-empted by the FCRA's requirement that such reports be furnishedonly pursuant to an ``order of the court'' signed by a judge (section 604(1)),or furnished for other purposes not applicable to grand jury subpoenas(section 604(2)-(3)), and by section 607(a). A state statute requiringautomatic dislosure of a deletion or dispute statement to every personwho has previously received a consumer report containing the disputed information,regardless of whether the consumer designates such persons to receive thisdisclosure, is pre-empted by section 604 of the FCRA, which permits disclosureonly for specified, permissible purposes and by section 607(a), which requiresconsumer reporting agencies to limit the furnishing of consumer reportsto purposes listed under section 604. Absent a specific designation bythe consumer, the consumer reporting agency has no reason to believe allpast recipients would have a present, permissible purpose to receive thereports.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Statute Providing Access for Enforcement Purposes</ITAG>A state ``little FCRA'' that permits state officials access to a consumerreporting agency's files for the purpose of enforcing that statute justas Federal agencies are permitted access to such files under the FCRA,is not pre-empted by the FCRA.Effective DateThe FCRA was enacted October 26, 1970, and became effective April 24, 1971.<ITAG tagnum="21">By direction of the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Benjamin I.
