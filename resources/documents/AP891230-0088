The new party is the 2,000-member Party of Democrats ofLithuania, which advocates full autonomy for the Baltic republic of3.7 million people, said Pyatrus Pechelunas, a member of the partypresidium.   The party supports neither socialism nor capitalism but believesLithuanians should choose an economic system after the republicachieves independence, he said from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.   Alternative political parties were illegal until early December,when the Lithuanian Parliament eliminated a section of theconstitution guaranteeing the supremacy of the Communist Party andsubstituted a multiparty system for the small republic.   Non-Communist parties have cropped up elsewhere in the SovietUnion but remain illegal. Lithuania's Baltic neighbors, Latvia andEstonia, are expected to vote in January on similar constitutionalamendments permitting multiple political parties.   Also registered Friday was the independent Communist Party ofLithuania. A party congress voted 855-160 last week to break awayfrom the Soviet Communist Party and support independence for theBaltic republic.   The registration of the two Lithuanian parties also was reportedSaturday in the Moscow-based Sovietskaya Rossia newspaper.   The moves in Lithuanian have brought furious complaints fromKremlin leaders, who delegated President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, headof the Soviet Communist Party, to travel to Lithuania in the nearfuture to discuss the controversy.   Meanwhile, conservative Communists formed a provisionalleadership for a Communist Party that would remain an integral partof the Soviet one, Tass reported Saturday. The group opposesindependence, said Vladislav Shved, a secretary of the``provisional Central Committee,'' in an interview with the DefenseMinistry newspaper Red Star.   The newspaper quoted Shved as saying the group hoped Gorbachev'svisit would swing wavering Communists back into the Kremlin'sembrace.   Gintautas Alksninis of Sajudis, the main Lithuanian activistgroup, estimated the pro-Moscow group has the support ofapproximately 20 percent of the 204,000 Communist Party members inLithuania.   Alksninis, speaking by telephone from Vilnius, said numerouspolitical parties are signing up members in Lithuania and theyshould be registered soon. The Social Democrats are the largest ofthe non-Communists, he said.   The first election pitting alternative parties in Lithuania willbe the republic's parliamentary election Feb. 24.   In the first election with multiple candidates in March, thosebacked by Sajudis trounced conservative Communists who had heldpositions of power for decades. Sajudis, as a broad-basedpro-democracy group, includes members of various parties, includingprogressive Communists.   The growing independence of the Baltic nations and other Sovietrepublics presents Gorbachev with one of his most pressingproblems. His advocacy of reform since taking power in 1985 helpedfuel movements that toppled hard-line governments in Hungary,Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany and Bulgaria thisyear.   But Gorbachev, faced with the same sort of reform movements thathe encouraged elsewhere, is trying to slow such nationalism toprevent the breakup of the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
