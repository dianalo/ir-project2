On occasion, a report will issue from the Bank suggesting that some part of it understands the need to emphasize the market in development policies. But advice the Bank is giving the Philippines reflects a mindset mired in the statism of the past.    A confidential World Bank report now making the rounds, &quot;The Poverty Challenge in the Philippines,&quot; trumpets the same interventionist policies that got the Philippines into its current mess. Though the rest of the world is today moving away from these failed ideas, the World Bank plumps for a more progressive tax curve and a doubling of government expenditure on social services as a proportion of GNP. It is particularly upset over population growth, namely that the millions of foreign dollars pumped into the country haven't convinced Filipinos that zero population growth is the path to prosperity.    The report charts how income, land, health care, education and other resources are unevenly distributed in the Philippines. It also demonstrates that population increase means that there are more poor people today. Its solution: The government must redistribute these goods properly and make sure there are fewer Filipinos to redistribute them to. In a chapter on Philippine population policies, the Bank makes this last point explicit. &quot;Population growth is regressive from every point of view,&quot; says the Bank, citing the &quot;limited ratio of natural resources to population.&quot;    Such advice shows that the Bank is still fighting the supply-side notion that a country's people are a resource more valuable than its rich land and raw materials. Nor does it deal with the central concept of incentives. Perhaps an enterprising Ph.D. candidate in the Philippines will apply himself to the question of how much the country's economic stagnation is due to the patronizing intervention of agencies like the World Bank, USAID, and the U.N. Fund for Population Activities.    Much of this zero-sum ideology can be traced to a speech the then-president of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, delivered in 1977 at MIT. There population growth was called the world's &quot;gravest threat&quot; outside of nuclear war. No cost was too high in Mr. McNamara's own crusade against population growth. Though he went on to say that no government really wanted this to mean coercion, they simply could not afford &quot;to let population pressures grow so dangerously large.&quot; We know where this kind of talk can lead from the experience in India, which at one point was using forced sterilization, and in Communist China, with episodes of forced abortions and even female infanticide.    Certainly the Philippine economy has problems. Its government is the largest employer, and the U.S. government is the second-largest employer. There are controls on the transfer of goods in and out of the country, on the transfer of exchange, and on foreign ownership; a large number of state-owned enterprises have yet to be privatized. With so much work to be done it is astounding to see the World Bank complaining that the problem is too much labor, particularly in a country whose democratic government was swept into office under the banner of &quot;People Power.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
