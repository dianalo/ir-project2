In a ritual reminiscent of the potlatch, an ancient NativeAmerican ceremony in which tribal leaders would demonstratetheir virtue by giving away their most valuable belongings,an increasing number of politicians, with great fanfare, arereturning political contributions from the savings and loanindustry.</LP><TEXT>   Among those who have vowed to return some or all of theirSandamp;L contributions are Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.), ChairmanRonald Brown of the Democratic National Committee and Sen.Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), who is under scrutiny by theSenate Ethics Committee for his ties to the failed LincolnSavings andamp; Loan Association.   The politicians appear to disagree about what to do withthe spurned donations. In a Sunday appearance on NBC's &quot;Meetthe Press,&quot; Sen. Dole said he thought it made the most senseto give the money to the Treasury. That's the tack Sen.Riegle plans to take as soon as he's finished&quot;cross-checking&quot; his files for Sandamp;L money, a spokeswoman said.But the DNC prefers to return a $5,000 Sandamp;L donation to thegiver, whom it declines to identify.   Sen. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.) chose a more novel approach:giving the money to his home state's department of revenue.   In a prepared statement, Sen. Wirth said he would ridhimself of $98,950 in campaign contributions from the savingsand loan industry and from Sandamp;L customers &quot;known to havefailed to repay Sandamp;L loans.&quot; The figure represents anaccumulation of contributions going back to 1980, whenbanking deregulation began. At the time, Sen. Wirth was amember of the House.   Sen. Wirth said he was giving the money to his home statebecause Colorado taxpayers are voters, because Coloradans mayhave been personally liable as U.S. taxpayers forcontributions made by owners of failed Sandamp;Ls, and because &quot;thecost of the Sandamp;L scandal will be carried by every Coloradotaxpayer.&quot; Asked to elaborate, Sen. Wirth said that if themoney went to the U.S. Treasury it would be spent to &quot;buildMX missiles.&quot;   The issue of savings and loan contributions has beenprominent in a few House races around the country. InGeorgia, for example, a potential Republican opponent toDemocratic Rep. Doug Barnard put up billboards urging Rep.Barnard to give back $20,000 in campaign contributions fromCharles Keating and his associates. Mr. Keating controlledLincoln Savings andamp; Loan, whose failure is expected to cost thegovernment $2 billion. A spokesman in Rep. Barnard's officesaid the congressman has returned some Sandamp;L contributions butnot the Keating money.   Thrift contributions began to loom larger as an issueearlier this month when Edward Rollins, co-chairman of theNational Republican Congressional Committee, said on NBC's&quot;Meet the Press&quot; that &quot;any member who took money from thesavings and loans ought to throw it into the Treasury andmake a contribution towards this massive problem.&quot; Mr. Brown,another guest on the program, responded with the pledge thatthe DNC, &quot;if we have received any money, is giving it allback.&quot; According to DNC spokesman Michael McCurry, Mr. Brownhad already arranged to return the $5,000.   A few days after Mr. Rollins's televised remarks, aspokesman for Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), who facesre-election this fall, told the Detroit News that Sen. Levinwould send to the U.S. Treasury campaign contributions fromany individuals who are &quot;under investigation for civil orcriminal wrongdoing&quot; involving thrifts. Sen Riegle made hispledge the following day.   Sen. Levin's spokesman, Willie Blacklow, said that Sen.Levin had recently sent some Sandamp;L money to the Treasury,though he wouldn't say how much.   There are signs that the Republicans are beginning toregret making thrift contributions an issue. One week afterMr. Rollins's appearance on &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Sen. Dole facedrigorous questioning on the same program about hispresidential campaign's political contributions from Mr.Keating. Sen. Dole said he'd be happy to return the Keatingmoney, but protested, &quot;We had thousands of contributors; Ididn't go down and check them out.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
