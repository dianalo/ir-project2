(NCSI) of Falls Church, Va., received thecontract to design, develop, test, train, document and deploy two of SAMMS'seven subsystems.andP;  The company also will purchase and deliver the hardwareneeded to handle the revised system.andM;Donald Gardier, SAMMS program manager, said the first-year cost could amountto $24 million, with total costs reaching up to $103 million over five years.andM;SAMMS is the uniform ADP system used in five of DLA's six supply centers tobuy and manage DLA's inventory of clothing, medical and hardware itemssupplied to the military.andP;  DLA's supply centers are located in Columbus andDayton, Ohio, Richmond, Va., and two sites in Philadelphia.andM;The system support all military services, including 15,000 users within DLA.andO;SAMMS is under the direction of the DLA Systems Automation Center and the DLAConstruction Supply Center in Columbus.andM;The improvement project, called SAMMS Immediate Improvement Initiative, willprovide shared access to supply data using a related database facility,resulting in a far more interactive system, DLA officials said.andP;  Users willbe able to update computer files on line, and the project will save moneythrough increased productivity, improved inventory accuracy and decreasedpersonnel hours and processing time, they said.andM;Earl Nichols, a DLA spokesman, said DLA is responsible for 2.4 million itemsa year, compared with 1.7 million four years ago.andM;Gardier said NCSI would upgrade SAMMS' requirements and distributionsubsystems.andP;  He said the requirements subsystem is the most archaic of thesystems, and currently has &quot;a flat, sequential file structure.&quot;andM;The distribution subsystem now has a random-access file structure, which willbe converted to a subject database.andM;Cheryl Ryan, a DLA spokeswoman, said the new hardware will be seized tohandle all modifications and redesigned SAMMS components.andP;  Other SAMMSsubsystems are being redesigned partially.andP;  But she said the two subsystemsNCSI will redesign are &quot;the guts of the supply portion of the system,&quot;allowing DLA to go to a state-of-the-art on-line database system.andM;Gardier said the original SAMMS was written in COBOL 20 years ago bygovernment programmers, but the new contractor might elect to use a languagemore appropriate to the new specifications.andM;NCSI should complete the two subsystems by the spring of 1991, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
