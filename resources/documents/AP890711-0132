Agents have identified up to 100 suspects, some militarypolicemen, at Hill Air Force Base, other Utah installations and 15other communities in the West and Southwest, said Robert Bryant,agent in charge of the FBI's Utah office.   The indictments remained sealed in federal court and the names ofthe people were not released.   ``The thefts at Hill ... appear to be part of a larger probleminvolving other states and other military establishments,'' saidU.S. Attorney Dee Benson.   ``Unfortunately, many of the participants are military policemen,and we find that especially disturbing.''   Benson identified the two men arrested at a Bountiful restaurantMonday night as Airman 1st Class Brian Roth of Chesterland, Ohio,and Senior Airman Danny Joe Stroud of Newton, Kan. Their ages werenot released.   Benson said he expected ``many more'' arrests in coming weeks.   Operation Punchout, a joint effort of the FBI, the Department ofthe Defense and the Air Force, began in 1986 when stolen militarygoods became increasingly available in the Salt Lake Valley, Bryantsaid.   It targeted military and civilian personnel as well asunscrupulous wholesalers of stolen goods, he said.   The FBI established a storefront in Roy near the base calledMilitary Surplus Brokers, which spent about $80,000 to buy thousandsof items worth about $600,000 stolen from all branches of themilitary, Bryant said.   Benson said the stolen military equipment included sleeping bags,helmets, canteens, munitions and firearms, as well as the jetengines, although no military systems or strategic weapons wereinvolved.   He said the purchases resulted in ``the identification of morethan 100 suspects throughout the United States who are involved inthe theft and sale of stolen government property.''   He said Roth and Stroud had approached undercover officers withan offer to sell the jet fighter engines. The two were given a downpayment of $10,000 toward a purchase price of $300,000 for the threeengines, valued at $2 million each, he said.   The two men brought the engines to the FBI agents by trailer.   Both were charged with theft of government property andconspiracy. They were jailed without bail.   The Pratt andamp; Whitney F100-PW-200 engines were reported missinglast Wednesday by maintenance personnel returning from theIndependence Day holiday.   Bryant said between 25 percent and 30 percent of those believedinvolved are active military personnel, but none of them was ahigh-ranking officer.   He said there was no evidence the suspects believed they wereselling the jet engines to a foreign power, nor that they werelinked to thefts at other bases.   ``It was just good, old-fashioned greed,'' Bryant said.   Wayne Hufnagel, commander of the office of special investigationsat Lowry Air Force Base in Colorado, said the operation was known toseveral base commanders and that military equipment was permitted tobe taken off the installations in order not to compromise theinvestigaion.   The jet engines each are about 17 feet long and weigh 3,200pounds.</TEXT></DOC>
