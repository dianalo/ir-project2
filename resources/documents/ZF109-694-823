Watkins has emphasized that we need to be sure the propertechnical and management information is made available in a timely manner tomanagement officials at the right levels.andM;There is much more emphasis on quality assurance in environmental, safety,security and programmatic decision-making.andM;All those things need information -- not data -- management and technicalinformation so the decision-makers can make good decisions.andM;From my perspective, it's absolutely essential that the central activitiesand the program organizations in the field and the contractors all work inconcert to meet those information needs.andM;For example, in the civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program, we'retrying to locate a site for and ultimately build a final repository forradioactive waste.andP;  It's going to be a licensed facility of the NuclearRegulatory Commission.andM;A licensing process entails technical reviews and opportunities forintervenors to examine data, look at the alternatives and provide testimonyon why they think we might have taken a wrong turn.andM;It's an absolute necessity to record every step of the program -- here's atechnical analysis, here's all the information that supports it, here's therecommendation that was made, here's the record of who looked at it and howthe decision was made and so on.andP;  In order to do that, the Radioactive WasteProgram has designed the Licensing Support System (LSS).andM;That system is mission-critical to that program.andP;  It's as essential that theIRM function accomplish that mission as it is that we drill holes at YuccaMountain in Nevada or that somebody research a safer way to transport orprocess material.andM;The information is as mission-critical as the technical research.andP;  With theincreased concern about environmental and safety matters, that will becomegenerally true about all our facilities and our operations across the board.andM;We may not be talking about licensing a Savannah River reactor or a RockyFlats facility to restart in the same sense that we talk about licensing thefinal repository for radioactive waste.andP;  But we're still talking aboutsatisfying ourselves and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board and ourown internal advisory committees, as well as states and localities, thatwe've done our homework on the environment, safety and readiness to operate.andO;All those things reflect themselves in the information arena.andM;GCN: What is the status of the LSS?andM;TIERNEY: Because the program overall has been stretched out several years, Ithink it has sort of slowed down.andP;  Before, we were under some desperate timeconstraints to go, go, go.andM;That's no longer the case, so I'm not quite sure whether there's going to bea conscious decision to turn it back just a little.andM;We certainly bought ourselves some time.andP;  It might be wise not to go blastingahead full speed if we're not going to be generating that volume of materialfor several years.andM;Going full design and procuring at this point might put us in a situationwhere we've got today's technology and today's equipment dealing withtomorrow's problem.andP;  New technologies might come along that we want to takeadvantage of.andM;GCN: What is the next milestone?andM;TIERNEY: Because the overall radioactive waste program is undergoing so manychanges at this point, I'm not really sure.andP;  I suspect all those milestonesare being reassessed in view of the stretch-out of the program.andM;GCN: How does computer acquisition work at Energy?andM;TIERNEY: A lot of the acquisitions are done out in the field.andP;  Theheadquarters role depends on the size of the acquisition.andP;  Very majoracquisitions we would get involved in at the front end, to satisfy ourselvesthat the requirements made sense and there was a reasonable plan.andM;Toward the end of the acquisition process, we give the final blessing fromboth a functional and an IRM standpoint.andP;  In really large procurements, Ibelieve the threshold is $25 million for a specific review by our procurementorganization.andP;  Procurements of smaller size would get a less-structured andless-detailed examination.andM;We have a fairly well-developed information technology resources planningprocess, a five-year process that reaches out to our entire system.andP;  That's away to anticipate major new acquisitions, major new systems andtelecommunications developments.andP;  It highlights what's on the horizon for usand for the program organizations.andP;  It allows the reviewers and the plannersto go back out and say, &quot;This is one we need to talk about more.&quot;andM;GCN: Your five-year plan estimates that departmental computing requirementswill nearly quadruple by 1995.andP;  Meanwhile, budgets are projected to grow onlya couple of percent per year.andP;  What's your strategy for meeting thosecomputing requirements, given those dollars?andM;TIERNEY: Well, there are at least two answers to that.andP;  The plan reflectswhat people would like to do in an ideal world.andP;  The world obviously is lessthan ideal, so everything people put in the plan doesn't necessarily happen.andO;You get some attrition.andM;I think what probably is going to happen is that we'll end up expending alarger percentage of our resources on equipment, systems and IRM support ingeneral.andP;  That's just the way the world is going.andM;GCN: Any idea of what computing requirements you will be able to satisfy by1995?andM;TIERNEY: I don't think I could put a number on it, considering that this yearwe didn't know what our budget was going to be until a day or so afterCongress adjourned, when people had a chance to scramble around and read whatfinally came out in the appropriations bill.andM;It gets awfully difficult to forecast.andP;  Certainly there will be growth.andP;  It'sinevitable even within a constant budget that a larger percentage would bedevoted to those resources.andP;  But as to what the figure would be -- I'd justbe pulling numbers out of the air.andM;GCN: What areas do you think may suffer?andM;TIERNEY: Well, I wouldn't try to do the prioritization at this point.andP;  Onething I would hope we get out of the IRM strategic planning process would besome mechanisms to help us make those decisions more systematically andobjectively.andM;We have not had a good, well-developed strategic planning process for thedepartment as a whole.andP;  Some programs have had something, but there hasn'tbeen a coherent whole.andP;  One of Secretary Watkins' major priorities is to geta systematic strategic and program planning process so we can try consciouslyto make those trade-off decisions in a way that will have minimum harmfulimpacts on programs.andM;Trade-off decisions are very difficult to make right now.andP;  They get made, butnot with a great deal of assurance that every consideration has been lookedat and you're making the best decision you can.andM;Clearly, something is going to have to be stretched out or fall by thewayside.andP;  We can't print money.andP;  I think all you can do is keep the peoplewho make the decisions as well informed as you can.andM;GCN: Why did DOE begin its math and science education programs?andM;TIERNEY: The general subject of math and science education has been of majorconcern to Secretary Watkins.andP;  In IRM, we have adopted Woodrow Wilson SeniorHigh School in Washington.andP;  We have provided it with about 20 or 25 PCs thatwe otherwise would have surplused, and software for the computerlaboratories.andP;  We helped install the equipment and give trouble-shooting andmaintenance assistance.andM;We've also provided some assistance on a similar basis to a preschool run byShiloh Baptist Church.andM;In the Office of Energy Research, we've established an office to drive thisinitiative.andP;  People in the immediate office of the secretary are devotingtheir full attention to this.andP;  We've got efforts going with the EducationDepartment and other technically oriented agencies like NASA.andP;  The need is sogreat, the enthusiasm of the students and teachers for this sort of help isso great, I think people feel it has an impact.andM;It taps into what I see as a great deal of idealism and enthusiasm among ourstaff, both federal and contractors.andP;  We have a group of people here who aretechnically sophisticated, who recognize what a difference technicaleducation has made in their careers and their lives.andP;  They're really anxiousto encourage young people to get into computer-oriented careers.andM;Charles R. Tierney, the Energy Department's deputy associate director ofadministration, information and facilities management, has spent his entirecareer at DOE and its predecessor agencies.andP;  He joined the Atomic EnergyCommission in 1962.andM;Tierney believes IRM &quot;has never done a good job at strategic planning&quot; buthopes that will change soon.andM;GCN associate editor David W. Robb interviewed Tierney at DOE's Washingtonheadquarters.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
