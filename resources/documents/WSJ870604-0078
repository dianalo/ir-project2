The minister, Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, said he will propose that Brazil pay less than half the interest it owes foreign banks this year. The remainder of the interest would have to be refinanced.    One big U.S. bank creditor estimated that Brazil's interest payments on its medium-term and long-term bank debt will total about $6 billion this year. &quot;Brazil needs $6 billion this year to finance its debt-service payment,&quot; the spokesman for the finance minister said.    Brazil wants terms similar to those obtained by Argentina and Mexico, which would be applied to the entire stock of Brazilian debt.    The spokesman stressed, however, that the minister's statements were &quot;just comments, estimates. There is still nothing concrete.&quot; Indeed, a senior Brazilian government official who is close to the finance minister said, &quot;I don't think this is anything new. We have always said we will pay when we are able, and as our capability&quot; allows.    The first priority, this official said, is to propose and approve the country's new economic program. That program, which will contain the debt proposals, will be announced within seven to 10 days, officials said.    The finance minister disclosed the proposal during his first appearance at one of President Jose Sarney's rare meetings of the full cabinet.    Although U.S. bankers reacted coolly to the proposal, two of them, who declined to be identified, said Mr. Bresser Pereira's statements could be evidence of a greater flexibility toward negotiating a solution to the country's stalled foreign bank debt after Citicorp's announcement May 19 that it is placing $3 billion extra in loan-loss reserves.    Citicorp's loan-loss announcement came almost 90 days after Brazil suspended interest payments on its $67 billion foreign bank debt on Feb. 20. The Brazilians have interpreted this timing as significant, despite Citicorp's avowal that the date of the announcement was merely a coincidence.    But U.S. banks were otherwise cautious about reading too much into the minister's words. &quot;It's pretty vague. It may not mean anything. Bresser Pereira has been known to make statements in the past and then back off them later. Our reaction is one big question mark,&quot; said a New York money-center banker.    Analysts and bankers in Brazil noted that Brazil has yet to return to the negotiating table, and that Mr. Bresser Pereira's statements therefore cannot be taken too literally. Alexandre Barros, a political risk analyst, said that &quot;What people tell the bankers is not the same thing they tell people here. Brazilian governments are not accountable and say what they like. The name of the game is that things are different at the negotiating table.&quot;    Indeed, some bankers in New York with experience at the negotiating table reacted even more coolly to the proposal. &quot;It doesn't make sense when they say they'd pay half {their interest due}. They can't afford to do that. They don't have the reserves today to make that sort of promise,&quot; a New York banker familiar with Brazil said. Brazil's foreign-exchange and gold reserves are probably between $1 billion and $2 billion, the banker added.    On London's stock exchange yesterday, prices were buoyed by a strong rise in bank shares, which rallied on the news. But in the U.S., the finance minister's statement apparently didn't affect share prices.    U.S. bankers said they expect talks on Brazil's bank debt will resume at the end of June, after the new domestic economic program is approved. Inflation in Brazil is currently raging at an annual rate of close to 1,000%. This chaos in the Brazilian economy clearly must be Mr. Bresser Pereira's first concern, bankers said.    Brazil, which is the developing world's largest debtor, has total foreign debt of at least $108 billion. Along with interest payments owed since the moratorium was declared, Brazil may now owe its foreign creditors as much as $110 billion. In addition to its declining reserves, the nation's trade surplus has slumped in recent months.    Mr. Bresser Pereira has drawn a distinction between refinancing interest and the need for new money. &quot;We have a debt that needs to be financed,&quot; the minister said last week, &quot;and we need new money to invest here. If the banks do not refinance the interest, we will not be able to pay them.&quot; He has proposed that the banks either capitalize or convert to equity the interest owed outstanding. Brazil has no clear rules for converting debt to equity.    Separately, Mr. Sarney named Marcus Freire as minister for land reform, a spokesman said. Mr. Freire succeeds Dante de Oliveira, who resigned.    ---   IADB Suspends Peru Loans   WASHINGTON -- The Inter-American Development Bank is holding up loan disbursements to Peru because the country is two months overdue in making loan payments to the agency.    The IADB automatically suspends action on new loans or loan disbursements to a borrowing country when it is in arrears on outstanding loans. According to the agency's latest annual report, Peru had about $546.6 million in outstanding IADB loans at the end of 1986, of which $162.1 million hadn't been disbursed.    As previously reported, the World Bank has suspended loan disbursements to Peru, totaling about $471 million, because of overdue loan repayments. The country also has been ineligible since last Aug. 15 for new loans from the International Monetary Fund because of overdue loan payments to that agency. </TEXT></DOC>
