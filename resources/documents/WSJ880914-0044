Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS SEC </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its junk bond chief Michael Milken counterattacked in the Securities and Exchange Commission's massive civil fraud case, issuing about 50 subpoenas seeking testimony and documents from likely prosecution and defense witnesses.    But those subpoenaed don't yet include the government's star witness, imprisoned former takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky. Defense lawyers have to obtain a special writ because Mr. Boesky is in federal custody.    The speed with which Drexel and other defendants moved -- the subpoenas were dated Monday -- indicates they are trying aggressively to obtain evidence before the government files any criminal charges. As reported earlier, the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office last week indicated to Drexel, Mr. Milken and others in the civil case that criminal charges could be filed within a month.    Notices of some of the subpoenas were filed in a New York federal court yesterday by the defendants.    There isn't any assurance that Drexel and the other defendants will obtain all the evidence they seek. Recipients may contest the subpoenas, and the U.S. attorney is expected to seek to stay proceedings in the civil case.    Among the material sought by the defendants are any audio or video tape recordings in the government's possession. People familiar with the case have said that Mr. Boesky made audio tape recordings of conversations with Mr. Milken while cooperating with the government in 1986, before announcement of Mr. Boesky's agreement to plead guilty in connection with the government's insider-trading investigation.    Martin Flumenbaum, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison representing Mr. Milken, and the lead lawyer identified on the deposition notice, declined comment on the subpoenas. A Drexel spokesman declined comment, as did a spokeswoman for Mr. Milken.    Last week the SEC charged Drexel, Mr. Milken and five other persons with insider trading, defrauding clients and numerous other securities law violations in the most sweeping enforcement case since the passage of the securities laws. Drexel, Mr. Milken and the other defendants have denied any wrongdoing and have vowed to contest the charges.    Among those receiving subpoenas, according to the deposition notice, are various investment businesses once associated with Mr. Boesky; Fried, Frank, Jacobson, Harris andamp; Shriver, Mr. Boesky's law firm that negotiated his plea agreement and settlement with the U.S. attorney; and several Manhattan art galleries patronized by Mr. Boesky.    The notice didn't identify other recipients, but people familiar with the case said they include numerous potential witnesses, including former employees of Boesky organizations.    The subpoenas also provide an early glimpse of one aspect of Drexel's and the other defendants' likely defense. As reported earlier, Mr. Boesky's payment of $5.3 million to Drexel in March 1986, alleged by the government to be at the heart of the securities fraud scheme, has been defended by Drexel as a legitimate payment for investment banking services.    The subpoenas ask for information about &quot;any entity&quot; in which Mr. Boesky expressed an interest in acquiring a &quot;controlling interest,&quot; and mention U.S. News and World Report Inc., Simplicity Pattern Co., Scott andamp; Fetzer Co. and several other companies.    The defendants are also seeking discovery from the SEC enforcement staff, including information on Mr. Boesky's settlement talks and plea negotiations, according to people familiar with the case.    SEC enforcement officials couldn't be reached for comment. A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office said he hadn't seen the subpoenas and declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
