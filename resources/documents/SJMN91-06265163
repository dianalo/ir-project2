I heard it mentioned on the radio once, but the radio stationcouldn't help me.;   -- Diane Winn, San Jose  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  RIGHT TO THE SOURCE: FINDING THAT QUOTE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO><TEXT>  A  The public library has several sources for the roots of such expressions,not the least of which are dictionaries and encyclopedias. The library is alsowhere you'll find books by Charles Earle Funk (of Funk andamp; Wagnall's dictionaryfame), who reference librarian David Kravitz thinks is the author you've beenhunting for. Kravitz, with the Martin Luther King Jr. Main Library in SanJose, says Funk penned four books on the origin of words and expressions:&quot;Horsefeathers and Other Curious Words,&quot; &quot;Heavens to Betsy and Other CuriousSayings,&quot; &quot;A Hog on Ice and Other Curious Expressions&quot; and &quot;Thereby Hangs aTale.&quot;; MANDATORY RECYCLING FEE; Q  Browning-Ferris Industries has informedits customers in the unincorporated Santa Clara County areas that it willoffer recycling service. I've written a couple of letters because I wasinformed this service is not optional. Those who refuse to pay for it willhave their accounts referred to a collection agency. When I called BFI, theaccount representative couldn't tell me how much the service would cost andwhat makes it mandatory. Maybe you can get some answers.;   -- Hugh James, SanJose; A  The recycling service will cost 95 cents per month, says KathleenGonsalez, consumer affairs coordinator for BFI. Gonsalez says the recyclingservice is part of the contract BFI signed with Santa Clara County. She saysone doesn't have to participate in the recycling portion of the pickup butwill still be required to pay the monthly fee. She says residents won't haveto sort their recyclables. Plastic jugs, glass and aluminum can all be put inthe bin together.; ANCHORED IN THE YARD; Q  A few weeks back you ran an itemin the column about parking a boat in the front property. On our quietcul-de-sac, we have a rental unit and the renters have a 28-foot boat parkedon the front lawn. We have tried to communicate with the landlord but havereceived only promises and no action. We have complained to the various citydepartments you outlined in your article. No one wants to take this problemon. Code enforcement people say this is an &quot;iffy&quot; situation and don't want totake it to court. This isn't fair to the rest of us. If there's a violation,then the matter should be turned over to the judge.;   -- C.F., San Jose; A The reason code enforcement won't file charges is that there's a loophole inthe ordinance and your neighbors aren't violating the law, says Gary McLeod, acity of San Jose code enforcement inspector. The ordinance exempts areasbetween the home's front door and the garage door. McLeod says normally thisis a small area but your neighbors have a home that is an exception. The boatfits entirely in the area between the front of the house and the garage frontdoor. City staff has attempted to get you and this neighbor to participate incomplaint mediation, but you have refused to join. Without an ordinanceviolation, the staff's hands are tied.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910921  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  575  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, September 21, 199100265163,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
