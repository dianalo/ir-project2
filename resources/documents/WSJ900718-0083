He recalls his family's Sunday outings to the sameairfield in 1936, for joy rides in a single-engine Junker 43.&quot;It cost just five reichsmarks to circle the airfield andreturn,&quot; he says.</LP><TEXT>   By age 15, he was a member of the Hitler youth, like mostGermans his age, and he manned anti-aircraft guns. By 18, hehad entered the army, the Nazis had been defeated and he wasan American prisoner of war. Then he was bedridden for twoyears with tuberculosis. His family moved west in 1952 toescape communism.   Now 63 years old, Mr. Genscher has been instrumental inforging an historic opening to the Soviet Union that hasremoved the last barriers to German reunification. It tookmore than 50 hours of meetings with Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze in 10 cities around the world this yearto lay the groundwork, but the result will transform the twonations' relations.   Germany will be whole and remain a member of aless-military Western alliance, and the Soviets have won acommitment for an unprecedented level of German economic,political, scientific and technological cooperation.   Mr. Genscher's foreign ministry officials complain thatChancellor Helmut Kohl is getting too much of the credit formerely harvesting the crops planted by Mr. Genscher. In weeksto come, they plan to highlight the foreign minister's rolein advance of the all-German elections where his FreeDemocratic Party, the junior coalition partner in Bonn, willhave to fight to maintain its government position.   For most of the Reagan administration, &quot;Genscherism&quot; wasconsidered by many in Washington to be a dangerous, naivecapitulation to the Soviet Union -- a route to West Germanneutralism.   &quot;Now Genscherism has become a broad, mass movement,&quot; theforeign minister says as he drives through the East Germancountryside in his armored gray Mercedes 420. He defines theterm as his &quot;successful&quot; effort to change the East by workingmore closely with it.   So why were so many so suspicious of Mr. Genscher?   &quot;Perhaps it was because no one could imagine it would turnout this way,&quot; he said. &quot;Many thought it would first lead toa drifting away of the Germans (from the West). I've alwaysthought there is too little faith in the West in the power offreedom. Also, I am from this area, and I understood betterwhat was going on.&quot; Even before barriers started falling, Mr.Genscher would come to Halle each year for a secretpre-Christmas visit to friends and relatives.   He points out the window to the village of Reideburg,toward the farmhouse where he, his mother and his grandfatherwere born, and drives by the flat-roofed stone church wherehe was baptized.   In 1943, the 15-year-old Genscher was sent with the restof his class to man the anti-aircraft guns near town. &quot;I wason the radar equipment,&quot; he said. &quot;It was fascinatingtechnically. None of us ever knew such things existed untilwe were sent into the field.&quot; But he backpedalsdiplomatically when asked how many British and U.S. planes hebrought down. &quot;The planes flew higher than we could shoot andour radar failed when they dropped (aluminum) strips,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Genscher's tour is informal. The planning wasuncharacteristically ad hoc -- the expected escort of EastGerman police didn't show, and Mr. Genscher's driverimprovised from a stack of maps.   Mr. Genscher has slowed little since a heart attack a yearago and several bouts with exhaustion since then. Now, he isbuoyant. Mr. Genscher has come to his home region to help hisFree Democratic party, also known here as the Liberals,inaugurate a new local affiliate. He has been West Germany'sforeign minister for 16 years, but his party often hasstruggled to gain enough votes to join coalitions, first withSocial Democratic Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and now with theChristian Democrats' Helmut Kohl.   The party meeting is an hour from his birthplace inZerbst, a town of 40,000 which was the birthplace of Russia'sCzarina Catherine the Great. Mr. Genscher recalls mentioningher to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as one of Germany'scontributions to Russian history. Mr. Gorbachev replied thatshe, after Peter the Great, had been the most important ofthe pre-revolutionary leaders.   &quot;The people of the Soviet Union should know, that aunified Germany isn't only an opportunity for the Germans,but it is also a chance for German-Soviet relations, withprospects for the next century,&quot; he tells them. He shoutsencouragement to &quot;liberals,&quot; telling them that just becausesocialism failed doesn't mean that Germany should throw inits lot with conservatives. In East Germany, he must takevotes from Mr. Kohl. If the Christian Democrats score toowell, Mr. Kohl might cast aside his troublesome coalitionpartner.   Mr. Kohl and Mr. Genscher have crossed swords often inpast weeks, and one individual in the chancellery complainsthat the foreign minister doesn't always fully brief them onhis meetings with the Soviets. &quot;We have almost totallystopped exchanging papers on Genscher's meetings, and nowvirtually the only reports Kohl gets are given to him inperson,&quot; says an individual in the foreign ministry.   Mr. Genscher leaves the party meeting to a standingovation. But his driver gets lost again, this time in frontof a rickety wooden ferry that crosses the Elbe.   The ferry is slow. The foreign minister signs autographs.He balks at detailing his own role in recent history, but hisaides say that he several times prevented new Cold Waricicles from forming.   When the Soviets shot down Korean Air Lines flight 007 onSept. 1, 1983, the incident threatened to end the 35-nationConfererence on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which Mr.Genscher regards as one of the most important contributors tochange in the Soviet bloc. He made dozens of phone callsaround the world to prevent the U.S. from pulling out of aCSCE meeting in Madrid to protest the Soviet action. Onesenior U.S. official credits Mr. Genscher for keeping theconference on track.   Even more importantly, Mr. Genscher challenged Mr. Kohl tostop the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan to agreeto the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons at itssummit in Brussels last year. Mr. Genscher was convinced thatsuch a move would allow the Soviet military to block Mr.Gorbachev's intentions to make peace.   He won U.S. backing to scrap the modernization.   It was at that meeting that Mr. Genscher formed a closerelationship with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. Mr.Baker &quot;is a man who talks plainly, without detours,&quot; says Mr.Genscher. &quot;I can accomplish more in one hour with Baker thanI can in three hours with anyone else.&quot;   Mr. Genscher simultaneously enjoys a close relationshipwith Mr. Shevardnadze, which often has enabled him to act asunofficial liaison between the Soviet and the American.   The time for reflection passes. His driver is facinganother decision at the fork of another unfamiliar road.Before Mr. Genscher can press on with reunification ofGermany or revival of his birthplace, he has to find his wayback to the airport. The foreign minister takes control ofthe map and issues directions.</TEXT></DOC>
