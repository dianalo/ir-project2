The objective of this investigation was to gain a quantitativeknowledge of the mechanism of environmentally assisted cracking of ductile,structural steels in high temperature water. The specific uses of thisknowledge were: (1) to provide a theoretical under-pinning to the empiricallyderived remedies for intergranular stress corrosion cracking of Type304 stainless steel piping in Boiling Water Reactors, and (2) to evaluatethe fundamental validity of the ASME XI (1980) life evaluation code forcorrosion fatigue of low allow pressure vessel steels in Light WaterReactor environments. The approach taken was to propose a working hypothesisfor the mechanism of environmentally assisted crack propagation and thento independently evaluate the parameters of fundamental importance inthis mechanism. On the basis of these data, theoretical values of thesubcritical crack propagation rate could be predicted for different steadystate and transient conditions of environment (e.g., degree of aeration,impurity content), material (e.g., degree of grain boundary sensitization,sulphur content), or stress, (e.g., static load, cyclic load). Thesepredictions could then be compared with observed data in order to evaluatethe quantitative validity of the original working hypothesis before applyingit to the practical analyses referred to above.</TEXT></DOC>
