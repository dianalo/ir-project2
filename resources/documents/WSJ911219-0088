The 12 nations have 12 different languages. That clearlyconstitutes a major inconvenience for market transactions, atleast as serious as the existence of 12 different moneys. Acommon language would be a major convenience, comparable to acommon currency for fostering international trade andcommerce. Yet no one has yet suggested negotiations to decidea common language, or the adoption of rules and regulationsby the EC Commission to assure its use and improve itscharacter. Some individual countries -- notably France --have sought through government to control the development oftheir own language, to prevent the introduction of foreignwords, and so on, though hardly with conspicuous success.</LP><TEXT>   Yet Europe is closer today to having a common language forinternational trade than it is to having a common money.Despite the opposition of the French, English has become thelingua franca of trade -- if I may engage in some languagebastardy myself. How did that happen? Not through governmentagreements, not through Maastricht summits, but simplythrough the voluntary decisions of individuals engaged ininternational trade, who found English the most useful secondlanguage to acquire -- essentially the process of voluntarycooperation and exchange that makes a free private market soeffective for organizing the use of resources.   Nothing guarantees that English will indefinitely remainthe common language. After all, for centuries, Latin was theclosest thing to a common language, and French thereafter. Ifconditions change, some other language may come to replaceEnglish in the same way that French replaced Latin. I hastento add that these are the remarks of the rankest amateur inthe history of linguistics, but correction in detail will notrender invalid the basic point: that major changes inlanguage use have occurred gradually without any central planto bring them about.   I believe that the analogy with money is exact. The 12countries now have 12 different moneys. They, or some ofthem, have tried repeatedly to force them into a rigidrelation with one another -- first the International MonetaryFund, then the European Payments Union, then the so-called&quot;snake&quot; and most recently the Economic Monetary Union. All,with the partial exception of the EMU, have sooner or laterfailed, and the EMU is currently showing great strains.Mountains are being moved to create a common money byagreement, to be established by political means and ruled bya politically established central bank. So far that is hopenot reality, and I am skeptical that a truly unified commoncurrency will emerge from that process.   Why not proceed as with language? Let each country retailits own money, freely exchangeable with other moneys atwhatever exchange rates the parties to a deal choose to use(i.e., flexible market rates). Let a common money develop theway a common language has developed, by voluntarycooperation.   To illustrate: The European Currency Unit is a wellspecified average of the exchange rates among a selection ofcurrencies. The ECU is not money issued by any politicalbody; it is simply a well defined unit useful in accountingcalculations. Yet it has already begun to be used extensivelyas a unit of account for private transactions. A market inbonds denominated in ECUs exists and is growing rapidly.There is nothing of an economic nature to prevent a privatebank from offering deposits and making matching loansdenominated in ECUs, or for that matter from issuing currencynotes denominated in ECUs, though there may be legalrestrictions.   It is easy to envisage the ECU, or something like it,gradually developing as a common currency for intra-Europeanand even world-wide trade on a purely voluntary basis, justas the British pound had that role for a long time, and theU.S. dollar did in recent decades -- provided the politiciansdon't abort the development.   And ingenious and persistent Frenchman, Jacques Ribaud,has written extensively about a possible development alongthese lines, adding one most desirable twist. If an averageof n currencies comprise the common currency, each currencyhas only n-1 exchange rates with the other countries. Thatleaves one degree of freedom, as it were. Ribaud suggestsusing that degree of freedom to fix the purchasing power ofthe common currency. Such a development is more difficult toenvisage, because of the difficulty of matching the volume offixed purchasing-power of the common currency. Such adevelopment is more difficult to envisage, because of thedifficulty of matching the volume of fixed purchasing-powerliabilities with comparable assets. But such a developmentwould realize the centuries-old vision of a tabular monetarystandard of William Stanley Jevons, Alfred Marshall, and manyother economists.   I am wandering far afield. But my central point is clear:There is more hope for a viable common money by voluntarycooperation through a market process than bygovernment-enforced cooperation through a political process.   ---   Mr. Friedman, winner of the 1976 Nobel prize in economics,is a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution.</TEXT></DOC>
