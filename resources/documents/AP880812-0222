(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Football star Mark Gastineau and actressBrigitte Nielsen announced Friday that they plan a winter wedding,as soon as his divorce is final.   It will be a small, private ceremony attended by ``truefriends,'' Nielsen said at a crowded news conference.   ``We want something very romantic,'' said Nielsen, 25, whorecently was divorced from actor Sylvester Stallone and has a4{-year-old son, Julian, who lives with his father, her firsthusband, in her native Denmark.   No date has been set for the nuptials because Gastineau, a NewYork Jets defensive end, has yet to sever his marriage to his firstwife, Lisa, a model. They split in 1986 and have a daughter,Britanny, 5.   Gastineau and Nielsen were rumored to have had an on-againoff-again engagement after they met during the Super Bowl inJanuary, but this time it's ``true love,'' they beamed, kissing infront of hordes of television lights and photographers.   The couple acknowledged last month's reports that as a symbol oftheir eternal love, they have had their names tatooed on eachothers buttocks.   ``It means I really love this person and I'm going to be withher for eternity,'' said Gastineau, 31, who is attending Jetstraining camp at Hofstra University in Hempstead.   ``I can really call this true love,'' said the bride-to-be, whoproudly showed off her ring, diamonds in the shape of a nine,reminiscent of Gastineau's jersey number, 99. ``I am the happiest Ihave ever been.''   ``We want lots of kids, 10 of them,'' declared Nielsen, who saidher movie career will be secondary to ``being with Mark.''   She had a miscarriage last May while filming in Rome.   ``The miscarriage is one of the most misfortunate things thatever happened to both of us,'' said Gastineau. ``It tore us apart.''</TEXT></DOC>
