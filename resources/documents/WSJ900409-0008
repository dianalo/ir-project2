Mr. Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who counseledthe former president daily in late 1985 and 1986, was themost senior Reagan administration official tried andconvicted on charges of concealing U.S. arms sales to Iranand White House support for the Nicaraguan rebels during thatperiod.</LP><TEXT>   A federal court jury here returned guilty verdictsSaturday on one count of conspiracy with former nationalsecurity aide Oliver North and others to obstruct Congress,two separate counts of obstruction, and two counts of makingfalse statements -- all in connection with concealing Reaganadministration dealings either with the Contras or with Iran.   The prosecution charged that Mr. Poindexter coordinated aWhite House cover-up of arms supplies to the Nicaraguaninsurgency, which had been banned by Congress, and anarms-for-hostages deal with Iran, which Mr. Reagan hadpublicly denied.   After the verdict, Dan Webb, the independent counsel'slead trial lawyer, said, &quot;High men in government office whohave the responsibility for the security of this nation oughtnot to be allowed to commit crimes to pursue their ownself-interest.&quot; Mr. Webb had contended that Mr. Poindexterdeliberately misled Congress to protect the Reaganadministration from political embarrassment.   Mr. Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, said thedefendant would appeal the conviction. Mr. Poindexter didn'ttestify in his own defense at the trial.   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene set June 11 as the datefor sentencing Mr. Poindexter, who is 53 years old. Themaximum sentence would be 25 years in prison and finestotaling $1.25 million. None of the other six men convictedon charges related to the Iran-Contra affair have beensentenced to serve any prison time, let alone receive themaximum sentences possible under law.   Three Iran-Contra prosecutions are pending, including Mr.North's appeal of his conviction. It isn't clear whether Mr.Walsh intends to bring any new indictments related to theaffair.   Mr. North, a close Poindexter associate in the biggestpresidential scandal since Watergate, ironically became theprosecution's main witness. Though reluctant to implicate hisformer boss, Mr. North nevertheless confirmed theprosecution's central allegations when confronted with hisown testimony from prior legal proceedings. For example, hetestified that he saw Mr. Poindexter tear in half apotentially embarrassing document in which Mr. Reagan hadauthorized a 1985 U.S.-Iran arms transfer as anarms-for-hostages deal.   The court-appointed independent counsel, Mr. Walsh, hadpreviously dropped the central conspiracy and theft chargesagainst both Messrs. Poindexter and North because of concernsover the disclosure of classified government information.   The Poindexter trial contributed only a handful ofinsights into the tangled events surrounding secret Reaganadministration activities abroad. The more significanttidbits of information came from the videotaped testimony ofMr. Reagan, who was called as a defense witness. The formerpresident confirmed for the first time that hisadministration offered financial incentives in 1985 to atleast one friendly third country, Honduras, to encouragemilitary support for the Contras. President Bush, who wasvice president at the time, has repeatedly denied that therewere any such &quot;quid pro quos.&quot;   On the whole, the courtroom strategies of the prosecutionand defense precluded any startling discoveries. Mr. Webbattempted to compact complicated secret transactions andrelationships to fit the narrow charges against Mr.Poindexter. The prosecutor further narrowed his case bydropping some 10 witnesses he had considered calling afterMr. North provided his damaging testimony.   The defense, in contrast, took a scattershot approach,frequently switching subjects in an attempt to create animpression of a diligent, honest military man. Mr. Becklerrarely disputed the facts asserted by the prosecution,choosing instead to stress Mr. Poindexter's relationship withformer President Reagan.</TEXT></DOC>
