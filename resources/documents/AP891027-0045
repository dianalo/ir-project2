John Glenn was trying to reach Pope John Paul II in an effortto prevent a nuclear war.   Michael Breen appeared in U.S. District Court on Thursday andwas ordered held without bond and sent to a federal prison hospitalfor psychiatric evaluation.   The 31-year-old Washington engineer told District of ColumbiaDetective Tom Johnson that he wanted the pope to reveal thecontents of a message some Roman Catholics believe was receivedfrom the Virgin Mary.   ``The defendant stated that he wanted the notoriety of the eventto get the pope to read the Fatima message to prevent a nuclearwar,'' Johnson said in a sworn statement supporting the criminalcomplaint.   In 1917, three children in Fatima, Portugal, said they werevisited by the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus.   They said she made six appearances, telling them to pray and dopenance. Part of the story of Fatima also holds that there was asecret message never publicly revealed by the Vatican, said R.Bruce Miller, head of the religious studies library at CatholicUniversity in Washington.   Miller said some theologians doubt the existence of a secretmessage.   Breen told the detective he'd been having dreams for about 10months in which God gave him information about ``possible futuredisasters,'' and that he feared last week's California earthquakecould have triggered a nuclear war.   Defense lawyer Barry Stiller refused to discuss his client'sreligious beliefs, saying he'd only spent 30 minutes with Breenbefore the court appearance.   ``He's just a very nice young man who I think is a littleconfused,'' Stiller said after the proceeding.   Breen, an engineer with Martin Marietta Corp., appeared calmduring the proceedings. He looked frequently at family members andonce made the sign of the cross as lawyers conferred with theMagistrate Deborah Robinson about the location of his 30-daypsychiatric evaluation.   Robinson sent Breen to a federal prison hospital in NorthCarolina despite defense objections that it was too far away fromlegal counsel and family.   The charge against Breen is a felony that carries a maximumpenalty of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.   Glenn, D-Ohio, was struck in the jaw Wednesday while giving aninterview. The incident was recorded by a television camera.   A day earlier, Breen was detained by U.S. Capitol Police and theSecret Service after breaking through a police line and trying toreach out to Vice President Dan Quayle's motorcade.   Breen told police God guided him to the outdoor tree-plantingceremony where the 68-year-old Glenn was a participant and ``hestruck Sen. Glenn in order to get mass media attention,'' accordingto the statement distributed by the U.S. Attorney's office.</TEXT></DOC>
