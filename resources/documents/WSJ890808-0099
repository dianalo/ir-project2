Gottschalk Jr.@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 08/08/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><IN> MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><TEXT>   With interest rates on money funds and certificates of deposit down sharply since spring, some yield-hungry investors are flocking to a new investment that has a return tied to the prime rate.    The investment is a fund that buys portions of corporate loans from big banks, and passes along the interest, minus management and sales fees, to investors. The return is supposed to approximate the prime rate, an adjustable benchmark for the rates banks charge on loans to corporate borrowers as well as on many home-equity loans.    Currently, the prime rate is 10.5%, more than 2.5 percentage points above the average yield on a one-year CD.    That sounds just too good for a lot of investors to pass up. So far, they have put $1.4 billion into two funds that use the new approach, Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust, Los Angeles, and Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves, Boston. Van Kampen Merritt of Chicago has just registered a third fund, its Prime Rate Income Trust Fund, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    But fixed-income specialists worry that individual investors don't understand their potential credit risks.    &quot;There's no free lunch here,&quot; says Ian MacKinnon, head of fixed income for Vanguard Group, a Valley Forge, Pa., mutual-fund family. &quot;In a recession, these bank loans will be severely tested. And it doesn't take that many defaults to chew up your interest rate advantage over CDs or money-market funds. These are really junk loan funds.&quot;    Investors who switch their funds from CDs or money-market accounts into prime rate funds &quot;are moving from a relatively risk-free area into the commercial lending business where you must worry about a recession,&quot; says Glen King Parker, publisher of Income andamp; Safety, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., newsletter.    Officials of the prime-rate funds say these fears are exaggerated. Although 70% of the loans in Pilgrim's portfolio are for mergers and acquisitions, including leveraged buy-outs, the loans are senior, fully collateralized obligations. Over the past 20 years, the loss on banks' senior, collateralized corporate loans has been less than 1% a year, says Barbara Passino, marketing director for Pilgrim.    Ms. Passino says Pilgrim attempts to be even safer by avoiding energy loans, farm loans, real-estate loans and loans from foreign companies or single-product companies. &quot;We like boring, old manufacturing companies,&quot; she says.    James B. Hawks, president of Eaton Vance's new prime fund, objects to any comparison with junk-bond funds. &quot;These loans are the most senior debt on the borrower's balance sheet,&quot; he says. &quot;There is collateral available to be sold if the loans default. Junk bonds, in comparison, are totally unsecured&quot; in most cases.    Still, some fixed-income advisers aren't convinced that these funds are a good deal for the average investor. &quot;It's not a good investment in this environment,&quot; says Marilyn Cohen, president of Capital Insight, a Beverly Hills, Calif., bond-trading firm. &quot;With a possible recession ahead, what is an excellent quality loan today might be junk tomorrow. The increased return over CD rates isn't worth it.&quot;    Credit-risk considerations aside, the prime-rate funds present a potential pitfall for investors who may want to withdraw their principal. The funds are being marketed as &quot;closed end&quot; investment companies, a term that usually applies to funds that are traded on stock exchanges.    The prime-rate funds, however, aren't traded on any exchange. The only way investors can get out is to sell their shares back to the funds once a quarter. And while the funds say they intend to buy back shares from investors, there are no guarantees they will always do so.    Moreover, investors who sell back their shares may have to pay a withdrawal penalty. Pilgrim charges 90 days interest if a shareholder withdraws money in the first year; Eaton Vance levies a charge ranging from 3% to 1% if money is withdrawn in the first four years. The Van Kampen Merritt fund has a similar declining surrender charge.    Pilgrim's Ms. Passino defends withdrawal fees. &quot;This is designed as a longer-term investment -- not a money fund,&quot; she says. &quot;People use this fund for individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans, saving to send their children to college, and for portfolio diversification.&quot;    Some investment advisers also don't like the sales commissions and management fees on the funds, which are sold through brokers and financial planners.    Pilgrim charges a 3% &quot;load,&quot; or upfront sales fee; its management and administrative fees total 1.1% a year. Eaton Vance management and administrative fees total 1.2% a year. Both fund prospectuses note that the management fees are higher than those charged by most other investment companies.    Ms. Passino says the fees are higher because the prime-rate fund uses &quot;more portfolio managers per dollar of assets than any of our other funds.&quot; The fund does its own credit analysis of the loans it buys.    Whatever shortcomings the prime-rate funds may have, investors clearly haven't been deterred. Ms. Passino says the average size investment in the Pilgrim fund, which has been in operation since May 1988, is $25,000. Investors snapped up $875 million of Eaton Vance's fund in July alone. </TEXT></DOC>
