EPA previously extended the commentperiod in a document published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> of March 5, 1986 (51 FR 7593). In response topublic comments, EPA is restructuring the proposed aquatic toxicity testingfor all three isomers and the proposed mutagenicity and oncogenicity testingfor<T3> m</T3>-pda, and is now proposing that neurotoxicity testing be conductedon all three isomers. As regards specific modifications to proposed 40CFR 799.3300<T3> Unsubstituted phenylenediamines,</T3> the addition of which was proposedin the<T4> Federal Register</T4> of January 6, 1986 (51 FR 472), EPA is proposingto modify paragraphs (c) and (e) and add new paragraph (f) concerning theeffective date, 44 days after publication of the final rule. EPA will mergethe two proposals in the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>In the<T4> Federal Register</T4> of January 6, 1986 (51 FR 492),<T3> m</T3>-pda was proposed for testing in the<T3> Drosophila</T3> sex-linked recessive lethal test (SLRL), in indirectphotolysis, and for acute toxicity to<T3> Daphnia,</T3> rainbow trout, and algae. The same environmental fatetesting and aquatic toxicity testing were proposed for<T3> o</T3>-pda and<T3> p</T3>-pda as for<T3> m</T3>-pda. For all three isomers, it was proposed that additionalaquatic toxicity testing be triggered from the results of the requiredacute testing. No neurotoxicity testing was proposed. The rationale forrequiring testing was explained in the proposal. Comments were received from Dow Chemical Corp. (Dow), E.I. duPont de Nemoursand Company (duPont), Joseph A. Lowenstein Sons, Inc., The American PsychologicalAssociation (APA), First Chemical Company, and the Naylor Dana Institutefor Disease Prevention Laboratory. The public comments presented both newlydeveloped data and data not previously reviewed by EPA for all three isomerswhich, after careful review, have prompted the Agency to modify the proposedmutagenicity testing for<T3> m</T3>-pda and the acquatic toxicity testing for all three isomers,and to propose neurotoxicity testing for all three isomers. No modificationsare being proposed in this document to the proposed environmental fatetesting described in the January 1986 proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Modifications to the Proposed Testing Program for PDAS </ITAG><T3>A. Summary of Mutagenicity and Oncogenicity Issues </T3>1.<T3> Mutagenicity testing.</T3> The January 1986 proposal stated that theAgency believes that exposure to <T3>m</T3>-pda may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human healthfor mutagenic effects and that data are insufficient to assess this risk.Consequently, testing of <T3>m</T3>-pda in the SLRL assay was proposed; if this test was positive,the mouse specific locus assay (MSL) and oncogenicity testing would betriggered. DuPont's comments (Ref. 2 in Unit IV. B. below) were the onlyones which addressed mutagenicity testing. DuPont supported its arguments (Ref. 2) for not testing <T3>m</T3>-pda with references by Lee et al. (Ref. 3), Vogel et al. (Ref.4), studies done for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) (Ref. 2), Seiler(Ref. 6), Tanaka and Katoh (Ref. 7), Picciano,<T3> et al.</T3> (Ref. 8), and Ashby (Ref. 9) and with references in theC9 aromatic hydrocarbon fraction rule (see the 50 FR 20662; May 18, 1985).DuPont recognizes that <T3>m</T3>-pda causes mutations<T3> in vitro</T3> in the Ames test and the Chinese hamster ovary chromosomalaberration test (CHO) (Ref. 24) and that it inhibits mouse testicular cellDNA synthesis<T3> in vitro</T3> (Ref. 6), but duPont argues that because <T3>m</T3>-pda is negative in the dominant lethal assay in male rats (Refs.25 and 26), no significant new information would be generated by requiringadditional chromosomal aberration or somatic cell gene mutation studieson this substance. DuPont also suggested alternative testing which involvesdermal exposure of rat testis to labeled <T3>m</T3>-pda and measuring DNA binding in the testicular cells as theonly justifiable testing. The Agency has thoroughly reviewed the comments and data submitted by DuPont.These data were insufficient to change the Agency's findings that the mutagenicpotential of <T3>m</T3>-pda is inadequately characterized. The Agency still believesthat testing of <T3>m</T3>-pda for gene mutation in mice (Figure 1 below) is needed toadequately characterize the mutagenic potential of this isomer. However,EPA is modifying its testing proposal for <T3>m</T3>-pda in response to duPont's comment questioning whether pdasreach germ cell tissue and cause chromosomal aberrations by adding chromosomalaberration testing in mice to the proposed testing. The mouse is proposedas a test species for the<T3> in vivo</T3> tests because <T3>m</T3>-pda has been shown to accumulate in mouse testicular tissue(Refs. 6 and 7). These data, combined with the negative dominant lethaldata in the rat, support using the mouse as the species of choice for furtherchromosomal aberration testing (Refs. 25 and 26). The Agency is modifyingits testing proposal for <T3>m</T3>-pda to include testing in the<T3> in vivo</T3> mammalian bone marrow cytogenetics test_chromosomal analysis(MBMC), in the mouse, according to 40 CFR 798.5385. If this test is positive,a mouse dominant lethal assay would be triggered, to be conducted accordingto 40 CFR 798.5450 (Figure 1 below). A positive dominant lethal assay wouldtrigger a heritable translocation assay (subject to a public program review),to be conducted according to 40 CFR 798.5460. No further chromosomal aberrationtesting would be required if the MBMC is negative. As in EPA's originalproposal, <T3>m</T3>-pda would also be tested in the SLRL assay, 40 CFR 798.5275,which if positive would, subject to a public program review, trigger MSLtesting, in accordance with 40 CFR 798.5200. The Agency continues to believe that the proposed triggers and upper-tiertesting provide the most reliable description of the mutagenic potentialof a chemical substance. EPA's rationale was discussed in its proposedTSCA section 4 rule for C-9's (50 FR 20662; May 17, 1985). Results fromthe SLRL and chromosomal testing would be included in the decision logicat the public program review stage of the weight-of-evidence determinationof the need for the higher-tiered mutagenicity testing.As to duPont's proposed testicular binding testing in rats (Ref. 2), theAgency would consider any additional DNA binding data submitted prior tothe public program review stage of the process (Figure 1 below) as partof the total evaluation of the mutagenicity potential for <T3>m</T3>-pda. However, since this DNA binding test does not provide evidencefor the potential heritability of any effects which may be demonstrated,the Agency does not believe this test should be part of the required testprogram for <T3>m</T3>-pda. DuPont also proposed that <T3>m</T3>-pda be tested in the rat, a species already shown to be negativewith respect to the dominant lethal effect (Refs. 25 and 26). Therefore,the Agency is suggesting that the mouse be the species of choice for DNAbinding studies, if industry elects to include results from this test forAgency consideration.2.<T3> Oncogenicity testing.</T3> The proposal stated that oncogenicity testingof <T3>m</T3>-pda would be initiated if the SLRL were positive and the resultsfrom oncogenicity testing in progress in Japan were inadequate for Agencypurposes.In response to the public comments received, the Agency is proposing theadditions to the mutagenicity testing program described above. EPA's standardchromosomal aberration testing scheme, as described in EPA's C9 rule (50FR 20662; May 17, 1985) includes provisions for triggering oncogenicitytesting from a positive<T3> in vitro</T3> cytogenetics test such as the Chinese hamster ovary(CHO) assay. Because a positive CHO is available (Ref. 25), EPA is proposingthat the oncogenicity bioassay on <T3>m</T3>-pda be conducted without further triggering. However, the Agencyis also proposing that review of all the available scientific evidence(including the results of the proposed mutagenicity testing program describedin Figure 1 below and the oncogenicity study in progress in Japan) be concludedbefore the chronic assay is initiated. If, in EPA's judgment, the evidenceindicates that <T3>m</T3>-pda oncogenicity potential is adequately characterized, theAgency proposes to solicit public comment on whether it should rescindthe requirement for the oncogenicity test. If in EPA's judgment the evidenceindicates a need for oncogenicity testing, the Agency will notify the testsponsors to initiate the chronic study by a certified letter or by noticein the<T4> Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 078</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>B. Summary of Neurotoxicity IssuesThe January 1986 proposal stated that neurotoxicity testing was not beingproposed for the pdas. The neurotoxicity concerns identified by the InteragencyTesting Committee (ITC) were based upon the potential formation of methemoglobinin people exposed to pdas. Secondary effects from the methemoglobin developmentcould include neurotoxic effects. Pda manufacturers supplied informationshowing that methemoglobinemia could not be documented in people workingin the manufacture of these substances. Consequently the Agency did notpropose neurotoxicity testing for pdas. Comments were received from theNeurobehavioral Toxicity Test Standard Committee (NTTSC), PsychopharmacologyDivision of the American Psychology Association (Ref. 14). The NTTSC arguedthat the pdas produce adverse effects on the central nervous system andthat additional testing is necessary to characterize this damage.NTTSC argued that the pdas could metabolize into chemicals which are highlyreactive with tissue nucleophiles. This reactivity could lead to biologicaleffects on the central nervous system. These potential effects could resultin behavioral modifications at levels substantially below those that maycause methemoglobinemia. According to NTTSC, convulsive activity in humansresulting from chemical toxicity is already known to occur with some non-pdasat levels substantially below those which may cause methemoglobin formation.NTTSC states that 3 to 6 people per 1,000 are epileptic and that thesepeople would be especially susceptible to potential convulsive agents.Both <T3>m</T3>-pda and <T3>p</T3>-pda have been reported to induce seizures in experimental animals.NTTSC (Ref. 14) argued that there are enough people exposed and enoughunsubstituted phenylenediamines production to warrant testing. NTTSC furtherargues that sufficient information exists to suggest the pdas may posea risk of neurotoxic effects and therefore these tests should be includedin the required testing program. NTTSC also suggested a strategy to evaluateneurotoxic potential which was discussed in detail in their comments. Tosupport their arguments, NTTSC provided the following documentation.Effects in humans caused by the pdas according to NTTSC include: sleepiness,headache, paresthesia, gastrointestinal irritation, changes in reflex excitability,increased respiration, body temperature, and pulse rate (Close, Ref. 18and Berger, Ref. 19), and visual disturbances (Berger, Ref. 19).Toxicity of <T3>p</T3>-pda in rabbits was studied by Erdmann and Vahlen (Ref. 15),Pollak (Ref. 16), and Puppe (Ref. 17). Oral administration, subcutaneousinjection, or topical application resulted in both clonic and tonic spasmsjust prior to death. In dogs, both oral administration and subcutaneousinjections resulted in lethargy followed by clonic and tonic spasms priorto death (Refs. 15 and 17). The dogs also demonstrated edema of the eyes,reddening of the conjunctiva (Ref. 15), exophthalmus and increased intraocularpressure (Ref. 17).A major review article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicologyprovided additional information which indicates that <T3>p</T3>-pda interferes with the normal metabolism of isolated guineapig brain tissue (Ref. 19). In mice, <T3>p</T3>-pda accumulated in the brain within 24 hours after applicationto shaved areas of the animals. The <T3>p</T3>-pda was not detected in brain tissue 48 hours after the treatment.In both humans and monkeys, <T3>p</T3>-pda in hair dyes accumulated in the hair shaft and was excretedin the urine of both species up to seven days after the application ofthe dye.EPA has evaluated the NTTSC arguments and reviewed their submissions. Eventhough some of these data are over 50 years old, the Agency finds that(1) the manufacturing, processing, and use of the pdas may present an unreasonablerisk of neurotoxic effects because as many as 1,000 workers involved inthe manufacture, processing, and use of the three pda isomers are potentiallyexposed to all three isomers, and the data presented by NTTSC suggest thatthe pdas may cause acute and subchronic neurotoxic effects; (2) the dataare insufficient to characterize the neurotoxic potential of the pdas;and (3) testing for neurotoxic effects is necessary to answer these questions.Therefore, EPA is now proposing that all three pda isomers be tested forneurotoxic effects in rats in the neurotoxicity functional observationalbattery (FOB), according to 40 CFR 798.6050 and the motor activity test(MAT), according to 40 CFR 798.6200. These tests are designed to be conductedeither independently or as an additional parameter of another acute orsubchronic health effects test. Because no subchronic testing is beingproposed, EPA is combining the FOB and the MAT to provide the neurotoxicitytesting program specifically for the pdas. EPA is proposing that the pdasbe initially tested for acute neurotoxic effects and that they be administeredby oral exposure. Clinical observations would be made, at a minimum, beforedosing and at 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours and at 7 days. Both positive and negativecontrols would be used and the dose range would be as required by the FOB,according to 40 CFR 798.6050. Motor activity would be measured at timeof peak effects as determined using FOB. The two acute studies would bestructured as described in 40 CFR 798.6200 and conducted so that the requirementsof the two tests are not violated.If positive neurotoxic effects are observed at 24 hours or later, a 90-daysubchronic FOB, MAT, and neuropathology test would be conducted accordingto 40 CFR 798.6050, 798.6200, and 798.6400, respectively. At the end ofthe subchronic testing, animals would be sacrificed and the nervous tissuepreserved for histopathological examination as described in 40 CFR 798.6400.At the completion of the histopathological examination, data would be submittedto the Agency. The final report for the acute toxicity shall be receivedby EPA within 6 months, and those for subchronic neurotoxicity testingand neuropathological examination shall be received by EPA within 15 monthsof the effective date of the final test rule.C. Summary of Chemical Fate IssuesThe Agency states its findings in the January 1986 proposal that pdas mayenter the aquatic environment in sufficient quantities and persist longenough that exposure to the pdas may present an unreasonable risk of injuryto aquatic organisms. However, persistence data are lacking, and testingis therefore necessary to estimate pda persistence in ambient waters. Theproposal presented a new test guideline, the indirect photolysis test,to predict removal of chemicals in ambient waters and proposed it as atest standard for pdas. The indirect photolysis test requires that humicacids be added to the test waters because humic acids may play a key rolein indirect photolysis of pdas in the environment. Comments on the chemicalfate testing were received from DuPont (Ref. 2).DuPont argued (Ref. 2) that the aquatic oxidation rate study which it submittedon the three pda isomers closely parallels the conditions under which theaquatic toxicity studies (see Unit II.D below) were conducted and adequatelysimulate the removal of pdas from ambient waters by oxidation. DuPont alsobelieves humic acid is present in its well water. However, no documentationquantifying the humic acid was included in the oxidation rate studies.DuPont further argues that the oxidation rate studies in its submissionincluded rate-constant determinations under both light and dark laboratoryconditions and that the rate constants for each isomer were similar underboth light and dark testing conditions. Also, duPont argued EPA did notprovide reference to situations where oxidation occurs in the absence oflight, to justify testing these chemicals in the dark. DuPont argues thatunder the conditions of its study, <T3>p</T3>-pda is so reactive in aqueous solutions that no additional significantinformation would be gained from the required testing.EPA analyzed the oxidation rate studies and disagrees with duPont thatthe oxidation rate studies submitted in the public comments (Ref. 2) andEPA's proposed indirect photolysis study are comparable and that additionaltesting is not necessary.The proposed indirect photolysis test measures oxidative rates: (1) Insunlight; (2) under controlled conditions to minimize, or eliminate, biodegradation,volatilization, sorption, etc.; and (3) in the presence of dissolved humicacids, a critical ingredient in indirect photolysis (oxidation). DuPontmeasured loss of pdas under conditions with fluorescent light, no darkcontrols, and no dissolved humic acids. Fluorescent light does not resemblesunlight in wavelength distribution and light intensity. Dissolved humicacids play a key role in indirect, oxidative photolysis of the pdas inthe environment and were not included in duPont's studies in measured quantities.The duPont data from the experiments on <T3>o-, m-,</T3> and <T3>p-</T3>pda in Haskell well water were fitted to a first-order lossof diamine at the initial diamine  concentration  of  2.5  and  25 mg/L.For all three isomers, the half-life increased at the higher concentration.In a first-order rate process, the half-life is independent of the concentrationof the substrate. Biodegradation probably did not play a role in the resultsfor <T3>p</T3>-pda, since microbial counts were relatively low and the durationof the experiment was 8 hours. However, for <T3>m</T3>- and <T3>o</T3>-pda biodegradation may have had significant influence on theresults since the microbial counts were relatively high and the experimentalduration of 21 days was quite long. In all experiments, the loss of diaminewas all that was demonstrated. In no case was it shown that decompositionproducts were formed. Consequently, EPA is unsure that oxidation of thediamine was being measured in these experiments.In the experiments measuring loss of <T3>p</T3>-pda in Delaware River water, diamine loss was measured withand without aeration and the half-lives were very similar (aerated half-lifewas approximately 4.0 hours and the non-aerated half-life was approximately4.7 hours). If oxidation had occurred, the aerated sample of <T3>p</T3>-pda should have decomposed considerably faster than the non-aeratedsample.Consequently, the Agency has not received any information in the publiccomments which causes it to modify the indirect photolysis testing proposedand thus continutes to propose that it be conducted.D. Summary of Aquatic Toxicity IssuesEPA proposed aquatic toxicity testing for all three isomers, accordingto a specific environmental effects testing scheme. Positive results wouldtrigger additional acute or chronic testing. Comments were received fromduPont (Ref. 2) and Dow (Ref. 21) addressing the aquatic toxicity programfor pdas.DuPont argued that the aquatic toxicity data submitted in October 1985(Ref. 22) are sufficient to characterize the aquatic toxicity of all threeisomers. Moreover, duPont argued the use of fathead minnow and static testsystems provided useful data, as indicated by the broad range of sensitivityexhibited by the fathead minnow to these three isomers and the extremesensitivity of the minnow to <T3>p</T3>-pda. In claiming that testing in more than one fish specieswas unnecessary, duPont calculated predicted environmental concentrations(PEC) of 3.5 ppd and 6.5 ppb for <T3>o</T3>- and <T3>m</T3>-pda from the data submitted in October 1985 (Ref. 23). Applicationof 100X and 1,000X PEC as prescribed in the proposed rule led DuPont toconclude that no additional fish toxicity testing would be triggered. DuPontalso argued in response to issues raised in the proposal, that if fishtesting was necessary, precedent for using freshwater fish toxicity studiesto predict chemical toxicity to brackish and saltwater fish has been adequatelyestablished in the open literature. Therefore, duPont contended no testingin saltwater fish could be justified.EPA agrees that for pdas, testing of brackish or saltwater organisms isnot necessary since pdas are not expected to enter saltwater and is thereforenow proposing that any testing of pdas in fish be conducted only in freshwaterspecies. However, EPA disagrees that testing only in fathead minnows adequatelycharacterizes the toxicity of pdas in aquatic vertebrates.The Agency has evaluated the acute aquatic toxicity data submitted by duPontfor <T3>o</T3>-, <T3>m</T3>-, and <T3>p</T3>-pda in fish, invertebrates, and algae in the following Table1, and believes that additional aquatic toxicity testing in necessary forall three isomers.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._Acute Toxicity of PDAS to Aquatic Organisms (ppm)<H1>Substance</H1><H1>Aquatic organisms</H1><H2>Fathead minnow (FM)</H2><H2>Daphnia magna (DM)</H2><H2>Selenastrum capricornutum</H2><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>o</T3>-pda <D>44 </D><D>0.88 </D><D>0.16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>m</T3>-pda <D>1614 </D><D>5.9 </D><D>2.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>p</T3>-pda <D>0.057 </D><D>0.28 </D><D>0.28</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Ref. 22)</ITAG>The inconsistencies in the toxicity data between chemicals and among organismsalso leads EPA to propose refined decision criteria for aquatic testingin the following (Figure 2). <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 2090</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C, </ITAG>These data demonstrate that for unsubstituted pdas there are large differencesin LC50 values in the different species tested. Because of these largedifferences, the decision criteria in Figure 2, and the requirements outlinedin the NPRM, the Agency believes that additional data should be developedfor pdas. Both DuPont (Ref. 2) and Dow (Ref. 21) argued that <T3>Gammarus </T3>is an inappropriate test species for two reasons: <T3>Daphnia</T3> tend to be a more sensitive species than <T3>Gammarus; </T3>and the gammarid test has not been subjected to thesame intense peer review as the daphnid test. They therefore contend thatany data generated by the required testing would provide little usefulinformation for hazard assessment at this time. EPA has used toxicity data developed for <T3>Gammarus</T3> as part of its evaluation of chemical impact on aquaticsystems; examples are included as references 31, 32, and 33, and more recentexamples of <T3>Gammarus</T3> being tested for toxic effected are included as references27, 28, 29, and 30. Industry did not provide data which showed <T3>Gammarus</T3> to be an inadequate test organism. EPA finds no evidenceto cause it to modify its proposed use of <T3>Gammarus</T3> as a test species.  DuPont further argued that the chronic <T3>Daphnia </T3>test submitted by duPont (Ref. 22) is adequate to judgethe chronic toxicity of <T3>m</T3>-pda to the animals, and therefore no additional testing is needed.EPA believes that the toxicity of <T3>m</T3>-pda to aquatic invertebrates is still inadequately characterizedand that the proposed testing (below) in both <T3>Daphnia </T3>and <T3>Gammarus</T3> is necessary to adequately characterize differences inspecies sensitivity to <T3>m</T3>-pda.DuPont (Ref. 2) also argued that the flow-through system required by EPA'sproposed test standards would not provide different information from thestatic data which they submitted since these chemicals, especially <T3>m</T3>-pda, are very volatile and under flow-through systems thesesubstances would rapidly assume the same levels as those found in the statictest systems. DuPont further argues that the flow-through system wouldcreate logistical problems with <T3>Daphnia </T3>testing, namely, loss of animals resulting from flushingthe test chambers with fresh test water.EPA disagrees that static systems would be better for testing the pdasin aquatic systems. Flow-through systems are designed to maintain constantexposure levels to unstable chemicals and are therefore being proposedfor the testing described below. However, the Agency recognizes that severalof the static acute toxicity tests indicate that <T3>o</T3>- and <T3>p</T3>-pdas are highly toxic to selected organisms, and to repeat theacute toxicity testing of <T3>o</T3>- and <T3>p</T3>-pdas using the same organisms and flow-through conditions wouldnot be a cost-effective use of resources. Therefore, EPA is proposing certainadditional tests as described below.In response to EPA's request for comment on the appropriateness of usingone isomer as a surrogate for testing toxicity of the pdas, duPont contendsthat sufficient acute toxicity data are available for all three isomersand that the chronic data for <T3>m</T3>-pda are adequate for making a prediction of chronic toxicityfor this category of chemicals. The data submitted by duPont indicate thatthe toxicity of the three isomers may vary widely among the species testedand that <T3>o</T3>- and <T3>p</T3>-pda may be more toxic than <T3>m</T3>-pda. Consequently, the Agency disagrees that the chronic toxicityof <T3>m</T3>-pda to either fish or invertebrates would provide an adequateprediction of the chronic toxicity of the other isomers to these organisms,and is therefore proposing chronic toxicity testing for any of the isomerswhich meet the decision criteria for triggering chronic testing.The Agency is proposing that <T3>p</T3>-pda be tested for acute toxicity with rainbow trout and <T3>Gammarus</T3> in accordance with 40 CFR 979.1400 and 795.120, respectively.On the basis of LC50 values, early lifestage testing would be conductedwith the more sensitive fish (fathead minnow or rainbow trout) in accordancewith andSection;797.1600. The concentration of pda would be measured before,during, and at the end of testing. The results from the acute studies on<T3>p</T3>-pda would be incorporated into the pda test scheme to determinewhether all chronic toxicity testing is triggered and the appropriate organism(s)in which to conduct the chronic testing.The Agency is proposing that <T3>o</T3>-pda be tested for acute toxicity with the rainbow trout and<T3>Gammarus</T3>, in accordance with 40 CFR 797.1400 and 795.120, respectively.Using the fathead minnow LC50 value, and the 24/96 hr LC50 ratio to becalculated from the testing data, early life stage testing would be conductedwith the more sensitive fish (fathead minnow or rainbow trout) in accordancewith 40 CFR 797.1600. The concentration of <T3>o</T3>-pda would be measured during and at the beginning and end ofthe study. The results from the acute studies on <T3>o</T3>-pda would be incorporated into the pda test scheme to determinewhether chronic toxicity testing is triggered and the appropriate organism(s)in which to conduct the chronic testing.The Agency is proposing that <T3>m</T3>-pda be tested for acute toxicity with the rainbow trout andthe <T3>Gammarus</T3> in accordance with 40 CFR 797.1400 and andSection;797.120respectively. <T3>m</T3>-Pda is moderately toxic to <T3>Daphnia. </T3>During the acute toxicity study, the concentration of<T3>m</T3>-pda was 63 percent of the nominal concentration at 48 hours.The Agency requires these tests to be repeated when the measured concentrationis substantically less than the nominal concentration, unless a decisioncriterion is satisfied that requires a subsequent test to be conducted.Since the <T3>Daphnia </T3>EC50 andCx.190;100 andmultiply; PEC, the Agency is proposingto require a <T3>Daphnia</T3> chronic test to be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR797.1330. Although duPont submitted chronic data for <T3>Daphnia</T3>, they are inadequate for regulatory purposes because anacceptable MATC was not determined.Testing of all three isomers would be conducted in flow-through systems.Reporting requirements would remain as in the January 6 proposal. E. Issues for CommentThe Agency solicits comments on issues related to the proposed environmentaleffects testing scheme and for the proposed neurotoxicity and mutagenicitytesting.1. Dow (Ref. 21) argued that more scientific rationale is needed for justificationof the decision criteria (i.e., 100 X) proposed for triggering additionaltesting in Figure 2 above.The Agency recognizes that decision criteria have certain weaknesses andthat toxic effects for different classes of chemicals in different speciesof organisms may vary widely. Toxic effects may also vary widely withinspecific categories of chemicals, as is the case for pdas. However, theAgency believes that the decision criteria in the testing scheme presentedin Figure 2 are adequate for purposes of this rule. If data exist whichsupport use of different decision criteria for more efficient assessmentof chemical toxicity to the environment, the Agency encourages submissionof these data during this extension of comment for the pdas proposed testrule.2. EPA is considering expanding the analytical portion of the <T3>p</T3>-pda aquatic toxicity testing by requiring a quantitative analysisof the breakdown products present in the test solution at the onset andtermination of the acute test. The acute toxicity data submitted by DuPontfor <T3>p</T3>-pda indicated continued toxic effects throughout the 96-hourtest period at levels below the detection limit for this substance. TheAgency is concerned that either <T3>p</T3>-pda is extremely toxic to aquatic organisms of that it is oxidizedvery rapidly into toxic compounds which are causing the observed toxicity.The Agency believes that the mode of toxicity for <T3>p</T3>-pda should be identified. Consequently, the Agency is solicitingcomment on the degree of sensitivity of current analytical techniques andwhether they could be modified to provide more sensitive detection of <T3>p</T3>-pda. The Agency is also requesting comments on the analyticalmethodology for the <T3>p</T3>-pda oxidation products, their level of sensitivity, and thematerials balance necessary to account adequately for the <T3>p</T3>-pda added to the test chamber.3. Neurotoxicity testing has been proposed for <T3>o</T3>-, <T3>p</T3>- and <T3>m</T3>-pda. The Agency solicits comments on the testing program presentedabove.4. The mutagenicity testing program for <T3>m</T3>-pda has been modified to include chromosomal aberration testingin the mouse. Comments are sought on the addition of the chromosomal aberrationtesting and the selection of the mouse as the test species.F. Reporting RequirementThe January 6, proposed rule for pdas contains language about the submissionof study plans, for some tests, that applies only to two-phase rules. Inaccordance with 40 CFR Part 790 under single-phase rulemaking procedures,test sponsors for pdas would be required to submit individual study plansat least 45 days before the initiation of each study.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Economic Analysis of Proposed Rule</ITAG>EPA has analyzed the potential economic impact of the total testing programproposed for all three isomers. The estimated costs for testing <T3>p</T3>-, <T3>m</T3>-, and <T3>o</T3>-pda, assuming maximum testing, are $182,000, $1,330,000, and$182,000, respectively, or an estimated total cost for all three isomersof $1.69 million. The total estimated annualized cost (7 percent interestfor 15 years) is $186,000. Based upon 1984 production figures of 35 millionpounds, the total unit cost of testing is estimated to be 0.0053 $/lb.The worst-case estimated costs of testing as percentages of current marketprice for <T3>p</T3>-, <T3>m</T3>-, and <T3>o</T3>-pda are 0.13, 0.26, and 0.16 percent, respectively. This isnot considered to be a significant economic impact.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
