Jaffa suggests that Mr. Markman's reference to the Ninth Amendment as having &quot;no limiting effect at all on the powers of the states&quot; somehow ignores the effects of the &quot;Civil War amendments.&quot;    I do not see how an interpretation of the intent of those who drafted the Ninth Amendment could be construed as invalidating amendments passed some 80 years later. The 14th Amendment was not written to outlaw slavery, since that had been taken care of three years earlier by the 13th. Nor was it intended to apply the first eight amendments to the states because, if it had been, why would it have included the exact &quot;life, liberty . . .&quot; language already found in the due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment?    Admittedly, this argument has not fared well in recent years, an example being the landmark Gideon v. Wainwright case extending the Sixth Amendment right of counsel to defendants in state cases. But many (if not most) historians think that when the 14th Amendment is read as a whole, it is evident that it was intended solely to be a Reconstruction-era tool to ensure that the South would not be able to &quot;rise again.&quot;    Anyone who watched the Bork hearings with an open mind realizes that had Judge Bork been confirmed, he would not have voted to overturn Gideon, Brown v. Board of Education, Griswold v. Connecticut, or other cases that had almost universally approved results but were decided on shaky constitutional grounds. I believe one of the points Mr. Markman and Judge Bork were trying to get across was that these desirable ends could and should have been reached through more appropriate means.    Ronald L.
