(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A crowd greeted a young Vietnamese boatrefugee who made it to the United States alone after watching hisparents and brother die at sea while starving shipmates resorted tocannibalism.   As Hung Quoc Tran's grandmother fell sobbing to her knees on anairport concourse Tuesday night, the 10-year-old boy quietly shed asingle tear that streaked the blue union of a .   The flag, presented to Hung by Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., hadflown over the U.S. Capitol.   ``I think he'll feel right at home. It's a beautiful ending, ahappy ending,'' Anthony said.   The folded U.S. flagboy was aboard a crowded boat found drifting withoutfood orwater in the South China Sea June 9 by a U.S. Navy ship, the USSDubuque, which gave them some supplies but left without taking anyof the 100 refugees aboard.   The Dubuque's commander, Capt. Alexander G. Balian, was relievedof duty after the incident. He was charged with failing to renderassistance.   Survivors said a 12-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy weremurdered and eaten aboard the 35-foot cra theboy's family left Vietnam illegally by boat after their efforts forofficial emigration clearance failed. They set out in May hoping toreach the Arkansas town of El Dorado, where Tong had settled andraised a family after fleeing Saigon in 1975.   ``We worried. We knew my brother was coming. But no word, noword,'' said Tong.   In June, Tong got word from the Philippines that her brother,sister-in-law and nephew were dead. But she learned that Hung wasalive, plucked from the boat in June by Filipino fishermen anddetained in a United Nations camp at Puerto Princesa in thePhilippines.   ``I was so worried _ he's only 10 years old and all alone,'' shesaid. Tong began sending letters to officials, aiming to bring theorphan to El Dorado.   With urging from Arkansas' congressional delegation and the U.S.Catholic Conference, the Immigration and Naturalization Servicegranted Hung refugee status, and the Catholic organizationcoordinated his trip from the Philippines.   As Hung stepped from a jet at Little Rock Regional Airport,onlookers applauded and his family surged forward to meet him.   The boy leaned into his aunt's arms, awed by the attention he wasreceiving. He whispered to her.   ``He says thank you. He's happy to see Grandma,'' Tong said.   Anthony said he hoped Hung's story would publicize the plight ofVietnamese refugees who are stalled in camps like the one at PuertoPrincesa, where the 4,000 detainees include about 300 minors.   ``The shame of it is you have a lot of young boys just like thiswhose parents die or they try to come over here with friends orrelatives,'' the congressman said. ``It takes two or three years,sometimes, to process them.''   Hung also got a letter of greeting from Gov. Bill Clinton, alongwith an invitation relayed by an aide to visit Clinton at the stateCapitol.</TEXT></DOC>
