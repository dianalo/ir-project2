This analysis is basedon the Laplace transform as well as on the modal technique. The frequencydependent parameters due to the earth return effect are taken into account.A general transformation matrix is determined. Its elements are evaluatednumerically and then formulated theoretically. The difference betweensurge and characteristic impedances of a line is formulated. A formulafor the voltage in wave mode coordinates of an untransposed transmissionline is deduced. The sequential pole switchings of circuit breaker contactsare considered. The voltage in phase coordinates is expressed mathematically.The potential coefficients are considered as constants.</TEXT></DOC>
