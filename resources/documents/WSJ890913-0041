As thousands of East Germans crowded resettlement camps in West Germany, the Communist government of East Germany issued a sharp formal protest to Warsaw Pact ally Hungary for permitting this week's mass exodus. It said Budapest had &quot;unilaterally suspended&quot; agreements regulating travel across borders. The move came amid indications that East Berlin had begun clamping down on trips to Hungary. More than 10,000 East Germans have fled to the West since early Monday.    Officials in Budapest said thousands of refugees continued arriving in Hungary, and authorities expected the flood of emigres to exceed 15,000.    ---   POLAND INSTALLED the East bloc's only non-Communist government.    Lawmakers in Warsaw approved Prime Minister Mazowiecki's cabinet after the Solidarity official urged the Parliament to change almost every aspect of Polish life. The vote was 402 in favor of Mazowiecki's 22-member cabinet, none against and 13 abstentions. Apart from the prime minister, who called for immediate action to improve Poland's economy, there are 11 Solidarity representatives. The Communists have four posts, including the defense and interior ministries.

Yeltsin, an outspoken critic of some of the Soviet leader's policies, urged Bush to help &quot;rescue&quot; Gorbachev's political and economic restructuring program. Yeltsin is on a two-week tour of the U.S.    ---   The House approved a statute designed to circumvent a Supreme Court ruling and restore criminal penalties for burning the U.S. flag as a political protest. The bill was passed 380-38. Action on a constitutional amendment barring flag desecration is expected this year.    ---   New York Democrats dealt Mayor Koch a defeat, voting for Manhattan Borough President Dinkins in the city's primary election, according to projections. Ex-U.S. attorney Giuliani easily won the GOP primary.
