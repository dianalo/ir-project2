<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0762 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the search for cheap, efficient and reliable solar cells, the potentialfor organic semiconductors is currently being assessed. The use of appropriate,molecularly engineered and chemically doped systems has led to the developmentof metal-insulator-organic semiconductor cells with efficiencies approaching1%. This work seeks to develop a photovoltaic p-n junction between avariety of merocyanine dyes and cadmium sulphide. Optimum conditionshave been identified for the spin-coating of merocyanine dyes on topof CdS and work on the fabrication of a number of dyes has been undertakenin order to optimise their photovoltaic potential. 6 figs., 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
