In return, the deal would restore the utility's dividends, make its senior debt investment grade and transfer to the state the utility's responsibility for meeting Long Island's pressing energy needs.    Although nine state legislators from Long Island last week privately told New York Gov. Mario Cuomo that the state was being &quot;out-negotiated&quot; by Lilco, state and utility negotiators have been working around the clock this week to conclude a pact. The announcement could come as early as today. In what was perceived as a bargaining tactic, Gov. Cuomo set a deadline of 12:01 a.m. EDT today for the utility to agree to the settlement.    As of yesterday, however, people close to the talks said at least one trade-off still had to be made. That involved the possible departure of Lilco's chairman, William Catacosinos. The people close to the talks said that in recent days Mr. Catacosinos has wearied of the battle for Shoreham and believes that he has accomplished what he set out to do -- hammer out a deal favorable to Lilco, even if it means his departure.    A spokesman for Mr. Catacosinos declined to comment.    The latest negotiations are being conducted in an atmosphere of &quot;raw political force&quot; exerted by New York state, according to Gregory Palast of Union Associates, a New York economic analysis firm working for the Legislature of Long Island's Suffolk County. Gov. Cuomo has long vowed not to let Shoreham operate, because he doesn't think Long Island could be safely evacuated in the event of a plant emergency.    In exchange for agreeing not to operate the still-unlicensed plant, Lilco would be guaranteed a 5% annual rate increase for each of the next three years. In addition, the Hicksville, N.Y., utility would be able to enter on its books as a &quot;financial recovery asset&quot; about $3.66 billion of its investment in Shoreham, and would be able to earn a 13% return from ratepayers on that equity.    The rate increases and the recovery of the Shoreham investment are expected to permit the utility to make up more than $250 million in preferred-stock dividend arrearages. The agreement would also call for resumption of preferred and common dividends next January, with a common payout of $1 a share in 1989, $1.50 a share in 1990 and $2 a share in 1991. Lilco last paid 50.5 cents a share in February 1984.    Calling it a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot; for Lilco, utility-bond analyst Daniel Scotto of L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co. said he expects to upgrade Lilco's bond rating to at least a double-B-plus, which he said is just below investment grade. He also said he expects Lilco to immediately refinance about $800 million of debt.    At the same time, the agreement would effectively transfer to the New York Power Authority, a state agency, the responsibility of building new generating facilities on Long Island. New York state and utility-industry officials have called this an unprecedented cooperative arrangement in the electric-utility industry. The power authority is expected both to build new power plants and encourage development of independent power production by cogenerators and others.    Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and steam heat from a single fuel such as natural gas. Recently, both Long Lake Energy Corp. and Brooklyn Union Gas Co. have said they plan to exploit cogeneration on Long Island.    The trade-off that still must be made concerns a suit brought against Lilco and certain former officers by Suffolk County and others charging fraud and demanding the refund of billions of dollars to Lilco ratepayers. People close to the negotiations said Suffolk County may withdraw as a plaintiff in exchange for Mr. Catacosinos leaving the company. Under such a trade-off, the people added, the suit wouldn't be dropped, although Lilco would still try to get it dropped before the fall, when a trial is scheduled.    In Huntington N.Y., Wayne Prospect, a Suffolk County legislator who has pushed the suit, said that he has not been asked to make such a trade-off and that he wouldn't be inclined to do so.    In a prepared statement, Lilco would say only that it was &quot;pleased&quot; with the progress of the negotiations and that it hoped a deal would be wrapped up quickly.    The letter from the state legislators said in part, &quot;It appears that the state's bargainers were simply out-negotiated by Lilco.&quot; The letter also encouraged the governor to reject the settlement worked out by his negotiators.    Instead, Gov. Cuomo has pushed hard to wrap things up this week, even to the point of issuing the deadline. </TEXT></DOC>
