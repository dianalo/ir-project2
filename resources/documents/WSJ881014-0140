Lublin (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mammograms, widely used to screen for breast cancer, don't appear to lead to reduced deaths from such cancers, a Swedish study concluded.    The study may inflame a long-simmering scientific controversy over whether the X-ray breast examinations save lives, especially among women under 55 years old. Previous U.S. and European studies have found the screening test led to between a 30% and 50% reduction in deaths in women aged 50 to 65.    Major U.S. medical groups currently urge that all U.S. women aged 40 and over undergo a mammogram at least once every two years. Between 15% and 20% of U.S. women now receive the $150 breast exam every year, up from about 5% two decades ago, the American Cancer Society estimates. About 135,000 U.S. women will develop breast cancer this year and 42,000 will die this year.    Health officials, &quot;not only in Sweden but all over the world,&quot; should restrict mammograms to women at least 50 years old &quot;and maybe even higher,&quot; suggested Dr. Lars Janzon, professor of community health sciences at Sweden's Malmo General Hospital.    Dr. Janzon is a co-author of the latest research, described in this week's British Medical Journal. The report concludes that the findings &quot;cannot be used to advocate introduction of mammographic screening in all ages in an urban population.&quot;    Dr. Janzon and eight colleagues looked at breast cancer deaths in more than 42,000 Malmo women between 45 and 69 years old. About half were invited to receive free mammograms five times over a 10-year period. The rest went unexamined. There were 63 deaths from breast cancer among women offered screening -- three fewer than in the control group, a statistically insignificant difference. But about half of the 63 women who died failed to show up for some of their mammograms. A 20% lower death rate occurred among women over 55 who were offered screening, but that also wasn't statistically significant.    Mammograms only appeared to help the older women significantly six years after they began receiving the tests -- when a 30% reduction in deaths occurred. The report said the beneficial effect may have been delayed because women who initially died were ones &quot;whose disease was at an advanced stage when it was diagnosed.&quot;    Even more troubling, the Swedish scientists found an increase in breast cancer deaths among women under 55 years old who were screened. The numbers involved were so small that this could have been a chance occurrence. But &quot;negative results of a screening examination may have falsely reassured some patients and caused a deleterious delay in diagnosis,&quot; the British Medical Journal report noted. These younger patients may have refrained from going to a &quot;doctor when they felt a lump&quot; in their breasts subsequently, because the mammogram hadn't detected any abnormalities, Dr. Janzon said.    He sees another problem with wider use of mammograms. Women with questionable X-ray exams but no subsequent cancer diagnosis &quot;will live with this fear and anxiety for the rest of their lives.&quot;    Yet the British Medical Journal report isn't likely to change U.S. practices anytime soon. &quot;There is an increasing use of mammographic screening&quot; for women on a routine basis, said Lawrence Garfinkel, vice president of epidemiology for the American Cancer Society. &quot;I see no reason why that trend shouldn't continue just because of this one study.&quot;    The debate over which women need regular mammograms &quot;is going to quietly smolder&quot; for some time, said Dr. John Reidy, a consulting radiologist at Guy's Hospital here. &quot;It's a very difficult area.&quot; In Great Britain, a government-funded screening campaign begun this year offers mammograms once every three years to women between 50 and 64 years old. The government decided it couldn't afford to give the tests to younger women. </TEXT></DOC>
