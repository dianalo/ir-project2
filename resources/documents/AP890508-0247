(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The urge to do good in the world stilllives among young university graduates, according to a collegecareer specialist.   ``Our top college seniors are looking for experience, theopportunity to explore, to be involved in something significant,''says Barbara-Jan Wilson, director of career planning at WesleyanUniversity in Middletown.   The image of egocentric, money-driven college students doesn'tmatch the reality, Ms. Wilson says. ``The real students that I workwith are struggling very hard to strike a balance in their lives.''   Ms. Wilson says that when she ran a career option workshop fortwo-year financial analysts at an investment brokerage firm lastyear, most of the questions centered on how the analysts could getinto teaching or the Peace Corps.   They want to do something that really matters, yet they want tobe able to pay off their college loans and make enough to sendtheir own children to college, she says.   ``At a time when it costs $65,000 to get an education at one ofthe top ivy-tinged schools, a student may graduate with more than$12,000 of debt. It seems impossible for graduates in thissituation to take volunteer positions in Appalachia or the innercity for $100 a month. Yet they do it all the time.''   One of the healthiest trends she's found among students ispostponement of career choices until a year or two after graduation.   ``How can a 21-year-old know he or she wants to be a doctor, alawyer, an actor? It is more honest, more difficult and more worthyof praise to admit, `I have no idea what I want to do for the restof my life,' and plunge into counseling battered women in New YorkCity, teaching English to the Japanese in Kyoto, traveling to theHimalayas with a sleeping bag, serving in Africa for the PeaceCorps or experiencing the excitement and drama of the world of WallStreet firsthand.   ``I predict this generation will not be consumed by the mid-lifecareer crisis; they are doing their thinking now.''</TEXT></DOC>
