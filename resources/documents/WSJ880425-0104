The High Court's 7-1 decision that Congress has the power to tax interest on state and local government bonds initially sparked fears that lawmakers would seek tough new restrictions on tax-free bonds. But if investors are at all nervous about whether their bonds will remain tax-free, they certainly aren't acting like it.    Although prices of state and local government issues fell briefly after the Wednesday morning decision, they quickly recovered. By the end of last week, municipal prices stood higher than they did before the decision was announced.    The Supreme Court's opinion was of special interest to the 100 or so analysts and industry officials here for the National Association of Municipal Analysts' annual conference. Some expressed concern that Congress would see the decision as an invitation to raise revenue through taxation of certain types of issues -- perhaps airport bonds or other issues that aren't considered purely &quot;public-purpose&quot; debt.    But most said they didn't expect any action in the near future. &quot;Congress has been nibbling away at the tax-exemption of municipal bonds, and it appears that the Supreme Court has confirmed their right to do so,&quot; said Sylvan Feldstein, manager of municipal credit analysis at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;But that doesn't mean Congress is going to do that,&quot; he added.    Of more immediate importance, those here said, are proposals that would compel issuers to provide additional information. More detailed disclosure about issuers' finances, the structure of their bond offerings and call provisions is needed, they said, to help investors make informed decisions.    New York State and Minnesota are weighing measures that would require additional disclosure on bonds sold in their states, while a plan to create a national computer bank of municipal bond information is pending before the Securities and Exchange Commission.    In addition, a plan to establish more rigorous industry disclosure standards was approved here by a 50-member sub group of the municipal analysts federation. The sub group, composed of &quot;buy-side&quot; analysts representing institutional investors with some $250 billion in municipal-bond holdings, voted to establish a task force to develop the standards in cooperation with the National Association of Bond Lawyers.    Several analysts said they would recommend that their institutions avoid issues that don't measure up. &quot;We're going to red-flag deals that don't meet our standards,&quot; said Richard Ciccarone, senior municipal analyst at Van Kampen Merritt Investment Advisory Corp., Naperville, Ill.    The $730 billion municipal bond market is subject to the SEC's anti-fraud rules. But issuers are exempt from the disclosure and registration requirements that apply to most securities. Though the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, an industry self-regulatory group, requires that an official disclosure statement be given to buyers, the board hasn't any enforcement powers -- and securities firms don't always comply.    Many municipal officials object strongly to further disclosure requirements on the ground that they are unnecessary, could tangle the market in bureaucracy, and would prove expensive for state and local governments.    But critics of the current arrangement see it differently. Compared with investors in stocks, corporate bonds and most other securities, buyers of municipal bonds are &quot;very poorly served,&quot; said Moira McGrane, director of fixed-income research at Kenny Information Systems Inc., New York. Added James Lebenthal, chairman of Lebenthal andamp; Co., a New York firm that specializes in selling tax-exempt bonds to individuals: Investors shouldn't have to &quot;go tip-toeing through the tulips analyzing every little&quot; facet of a bond issue.    Jerry Webman, a vice president of Prudential Capital Markets Group, conceded that increased disclosure requirements could well prove &quot;onerous and expensive&quot; for state and local governments. But, in some corporate bond offerings sold to institutions, he noted, failure to disclose information is itself enough to put the bonds into default.    The New York disclosure measure, now before both houses of the state's legislature, would make current voluntary industry disclosure guidelines mandatory. The Minnesota proposal, under consideration by the state's Commerce Department, would require municipalities to register their bond issues, disclosing extensive financial information.    Both proposals would apply to all issuers that sell municipal bonds in those states. Passage of the New York bill would have an impact far outside the state, however, because most municipal bond issues are sold by securities firms based in New York.    In Washington, Jon Petersen, senior director of the Government Finance Officers Association and co-author of the voluntary guidelines, said that they weren't &quot;intended to be a laundry list of items to be checked off.&quot; Making them mandatory would &quot;create by fiat a standard which may be inappropriate.&quot;    But New York state Assemblyman Daniel Feldman, co-sponsor of the New York bill, said he believes the legislation is needed to &quot;hold people in the industry to a level of care.&quot; In a recent interview, he said that &quot;the municipal bond industry has had it pretty much their own way&quot; up until now. &quot;But the public perception of the market has changed&quot; because of recent scandals, he said, and investors are concerned.    Several U.S. agencies are looking into possible fraud, bribery or tax-law violations involving roughly $12 billion of tax-exempt bonds underwritten by the New York firm Matthews andamp; Wright Inc. and others. Investors are also still in litigation over the 1983 default by the Washington Public Power Supply System on $2.25 billion of debt.    ---   Friday Market Activity   Bond prices rose Friday as traders were surprised by a government report showing that durable-goods orders in March were unchanged. Analysts generally had expected the report to show a rise of between 1% and 1.5%.    Weak economic reports usually bolster bond prices because they are often viewed as a possible indication of reduced inflation pressure. But economists cautioned against relying much on the durable-goods report, which is widely viewed with suspicion because the figures are so volatile from month to month and often are later revised sharply.    Still, prices of some actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds rose by about three-eighths of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The government's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose to 98 24/32 from 98 11/32, while the yield dropped to 8.99% from 9.04%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 3.28 points to 1248.12. The low was 1246.74 and the high was 1249.85. The government's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 rose to 95 25/32 from 95 18/32, while the yield declined to 8.77% from 8.81%. Corporate and municipal bonds also advanced.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed. The latest three-month bill rate declined to 5.82% bid from 5.84%, while the latest six-month bill rate was unchanged at 6.23% bid. The rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged about 6.82%, down from 6.95% Thursday.    Salomon Brothers Inc. analysts Susan Hering and Robert DiClemente say the Federal Reserve probably will tighten credit within the next month or so. The domestic economy's continued &quot;buoyancy&quot; may be viewed as &quot;an inflation threat,&quot; they wrote in &quot;Comments on Credit,&quot; a weekly report.    They also noted a pickup in money-supply growth that has left the M2 measure close to the top of the Fed's 4% to 8% target range, a development they say enhances the case for more Fed restraint.    Traders this week will be watching intently the government's estimate of first-quarter economic growth, to be released tomorrow morning. Many forecasters expect the report will show a growth rate of around 2% to 2.5%, after adjusting for inflation. But estimates vary widely. Although most expect the report to show continued growth, Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., expects a decline of 1.1%. He contends the economy already has entered a recession. </TEXT></DOC>
