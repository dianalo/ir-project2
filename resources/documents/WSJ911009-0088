Through so-called cashless-exercise programs, the firmsessentially lend executives the money needed to exercisecompany-granted options, then immediately sell all or most ofthe shares. Transaction fees and taxes are subtracted fromthe proceeds, and the executives receive the remainder.</LP><TEXT>   The business has grown rapidly in recent months, bothbecause of the strength of the stock market and a change inthe Securities and Exchange Commission's insider-tradingrules, says Joseph Kane Jr., a first vice president at DeanWitter Reynolds Inc. Dean Witter has quadrupled the amount ofcashless exercises it has done since 1990.   Cashless-exercise programs are controversial withshareholder groups, which say they encourage insiders to ownless stock in their own companies, and thus have less of apersonal stake in the companies' stock prices. &quot;Executivestock ownership is one of the most fundamental issues forshareholders,&quot; says Howard Sherman, a senior vice presidentat Institutional Shareholders Services Inc., a Washington,D.C., firm that advises institutional investors on proxyissues.   &quot;We have no problem with the simple cashless exercise, butwe have a big, big, big problem with the immediate sales,&quot; hesays. The easier it is for an executive to cash out of hisholdings, &quot;the more motivation he's going to have&quot; to sell.   But executives are enthusiastic because the programsenable them to turn paper profits into real profits quicklyand easily -- even if they are strapped for cash. &quot;Thecashless exercise makes the allure of stock options much moreaffordable&quot; to company insiders, says Rene Campis, groupmanager of the employee stock plan division of Merrill Lynchandamp; Co.   Brokerage firms are eager for the business, which they seeas big foot in the doors of some of the country's topexecutives. Considering the paperwork and administrativecosts, &quot;it's not a highly profitable piece of business, butit's a good relationship-building bit of business,&quot; says Mr.Campis.   It's also a way to &quot;capture&quot; assets. A lot of executivesabout to be given the proceeds from their option sale simplysay &quot;leave it in the money market&quot; fund at the brokeragefirm, says Mr. Kane. Sooner or later, he says, many switchthe money into bonds or stocks.   Firms that execute cashless exercises typically charge bythe share, with fees ranging from about five cents a sharefor penny stocks to 25 cents a share for $100 stocks. Most ofthe growth of the business comes through &quot;getting known bydifferent employee-benefits consultants, chief legal counselsand senior executives,&quot; according to Mr. Kane.   Indeed, he says, most of the initiatives on setting upthese programs are coming from the companies, not thebrokerage firms. &quot;With the SEC coming down and being hard&quot; oninsiders who don't comply with the new regulations,&quot;companies are coming forward&quot; to set up standardizedoption-exercise plans, says Mr. Kane.   The new SEC rules, which took effect May 1, eliminated amandatory six-month holding period between the exercise ofoptions and the sale of the resulting stock; the regulationsstill require a six-month wait, but the clock now startsrunning when the options are granted. At the same time, theregulations also imposed stiffer penalties for infractions ofSEC insider-trading rules.   In a survey of 70 large industrial and financial companiesby Hewitt Associates, a Lincolnshire, Ill., employee-benefitsconsulting firm, 46% said they planned to start cashlessexercise programs or extend to top executives and otherinsiders programs that they already have in place.   Still, not all companies think cashless-exercise programsare a good idea. In the Hewitt survey, 51% said they don'tplan such a program. &quot;They felt that a cashless exerciseprogram would make it easy, too easy,&quot; to sell stock, saysRoberta Fox, a Hewitt executive-compensation specialist andco-author of the survey.   The arrangements between option-issuing companies andbrokerage firms aren't exclusive: Insiders can exercise andsell elsewhere. But companies encourage the insiders to usetheir choice of broker because lower transaction fees haveoften been negotiated and all the paperwork is handledthrough a central location.   Earlier this year, Merck andamp; Co. contracted with Dean Witterto administer a plan under which all 3,700 of its employeeswere granted options to buy 100 shares of Merck stock. Underthe plan, every employee on the payroll of the Rahway, N.J.,pharmaceutical company could buy shares at $127.25 each (thestock's price when the offer was made last month) any timebetween September 6, 1996, and September 5, 2001, andimmediately resell the shares. The stock closed yesterday at$128.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS Inc. is designing a &quot;cashlessexercise&quot; options program for senior executives of Merck andamp;Co.
