In a brief statement, the Transport Ministry said the inquirycommission of officials from France, Niger and Chad had foundindications ``which tend to support the hypothesis of the presenceof explosives aboard the DC-10 of UTA.''   The mysterious crash Tuesday in southern Niger killed all 171people aboard UTA Flight 772.   The Transport Ministry said further tests should be able toquickly settle the question of the cause of the crash, but providedno details of what evidence was found or what tests would be carriedout.   Until now, French officials have refused to rule out thepossibility of an accidental explosion in flight, while agreeingwith UTA President Rene Lapautre that a bombing was the most likelyexplanation for the crash. The carrier, UTA, or Union des TransportsAeriens, is a private French company that serves Africa and thePacific.   Earlier in the day, French authorities denied reports that theyhad prior warnings of imminent terrorism.   ``None of our services, none of our ministries, received eitherthreats or intelligence about preparations for anti-Frenchattacks,'' said a spokesman for President Francois Mitterrand.   The news weekly L'Express reported Friday that the French Embassyin Beirut urgently alerted Paris to a Lebanese magazine's reports ofterrorist plans. French intelligence agents also relayed thewarning, according to L'Express.   On Sept. 15, the Lebanese magazine, Ash-Shiraa, quoted Islamicmilitants loyal to Iran as accusing France of reneging on a 1988deal that led to the release of three French hostages held inLebanon.   It said the militants were planning attacks on French interestsin Africa.   France has denied making any deal for the hostages, beyondagreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran. There have beenreports France also agreed to free Anis Naccache, a pro-IranianLebanese serving a life sentence for the attempted murder in 1980 offormer Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in France. Naccachehas not been released.   France provoked fresh resentment among Moslem groups last monthby sending warships off the Lebanese coast to protect Frenchcitizens and sympathizers in the war-torn nation.   A French Foreign Ministry official confirmed the embassy inBeirut sent copies of the Ash-Shiraa article to French officials butadded, ``All our embassies send us reports regularly.''   ``The content of the article is extremely vague,'' he said,speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with policy. ``Youcouldn't draw the conclusion from it that there would be an attackon a UTA plane en route from N'Djamena to Paris.''   Ash-Shiraa gained fame for exposing secret arms deals between theUnited States and Iran, but it has been wrong on several storiesconcerning hostages held in Lebanon.   N'Djamena, capital of Chad, was the DC-10's last stop before itdisintegrated. The flight originated in Brazzaville, Congo.   In Niger, helicopters began evacuating bodies Friday to be flownto Paris for identification. Rescue workers found the plane's voicerecorder in debris strewn widely over dunes and rocks.   A team of American investigators joined French authorities toexamine the wreckage. Experts from McDonnell Douglas and GeneralElectric joined them. FBI agents also were expected to join theinvestigation.   Police were checking the plane's passenger list and the ninepeople who left the plane at N'Djamena.   Some speculation in Paris has focused on Hezbollah, a pro-IranianShiite Moslem group believed to be the umbrella for factions holdingmost of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon.   Telephone calls to the airline and to reporters on Tuesday, hoursafter the crash, claimed responsibility for the bombing on behalf ofIslamic Jihad, which is believed to work under Hezbollah.   The calls were not authenticated, and French newspapers reportedwithout citing sources that police discounted the calls.   In 1984, the same Brazzaville-Paris UTA flight was bombed on theground in N'Djamena in 1984, killing one person. Chadian authoritiesblamed Libya, but investigators never established responsibility.   Several Islamic factions threatened to fire on French ships afterFrance announced it would send a fleet to Lebanon. The pro-IranianRevolutionary Justice Organization threatened France and the Westernhostages in Lebanon.   ``Recent events have proven that France's rulers have forgottenthe lessons and still insist on following the American criminalpolicies,'' the terrorist group said in a statement this month.   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization ... will not allowFrance to intervene in the region under any pretext.''</TEXT></DOC>
