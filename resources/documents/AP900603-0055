Gorbachev's visit to the Americanheartland on Sunday recalled Nikita S. Khrushchev's trip to Iowa in1959 _ both Soviet leaders were looking for ideas to rescue theirfailing farms back home.   Khrushchev returned to the Soviet Union and ordered many farmersto plant corn _ like Roswell Garst did on his farm that Khrushschevtoured near Des Moines _ in place of the usual wheat.   The corn did not fare well on Soviet farms, all of which liesubstantially to the north of the American corn belt. In fact, the44th parallel cuts across the very southern tip of the Soviet Union.   But climate is only part of the reason that Soviet agriculture isso inefficient, that food is rationed in many parts of the countryand that the nation every year must import so much American andCanadian wheat.   Much of the problem lies in the collectivized system of landownership and the government-owned distribution system thatGorbachev's reforms are just beginning to change.   Gorbachev said in Washington on Friday that when he began hisreforms five years ago he was naive to think minor tinkering withthe Soviet system would fix the economy.   ``There was no incentive. There was no motivation for people towork,'' he said.   Waste is a big problem. Gorbachev has said 25 percent of hiscountry's crops are lost in harvest and storage. Soviet economistshave estimated that from 50 percent to 75 percent of the potatocrop, a staple of the meat-poor diet, rots or is lost before it getsto the table.   Gorbachev has pushed through the legislature a law allowinglong-term leases of farmland and limited forms of private ownership.   So far reformers have been unable to enact legislation that wouldallow private individuals to own farmland, sell it to whom theychoose and leave it to their heirs.   In 1913, four years before the Bolshevik Revolution, TsaristRussia exported 12 million tons of grain. Historians write that mostof the peasants, who made up 82 percent of the population, were poorand that a primitive communal system led to small farms and pooryields.   But Soviet commentators are now writing that agriculture took aturn for the worse when dictator Josif Stalin collectivizedagriculture in 1929-32. Millions of people starved in the resultingfamine and livestock herds did not return to 1913 levels until threedecades later.   A disproportionate number of Soviet people remain on the farm:24.6 million out of a population of 280 million, versus 2.9 millionin the United States, with 245 million people.   The Soviet collectives are overstaffed and need farm machineryand general reorganization that allow U.S. farm to work with fewerpeople.</TEXT></DOC>
