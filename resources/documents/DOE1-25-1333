It provided a forum for the exchange of information on analysisand selection of spent fuel management, national strategies and incentivesfor international cooperation, as well as on the various technical, safety,economic, environmental, legal and regulatory aspects associated withspent fuel and high level radioactive waste management. The feasibleand proven technologies have already been developed and exist for spentfuel and high level radioactive waste handling, conditioning, transportation,short and long term storage, as well as for reprocessing of spent fueland recycling of recovered plutonium and uranium. Technological and engineeringdevelopment and safety assessment of spent fuel and high level radioactivewaste disposal into deep geological formations are areas in which intensiveresearch and development are being carried out. A separate abstract wasprepared for each of these papers. Refs, figs, tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
