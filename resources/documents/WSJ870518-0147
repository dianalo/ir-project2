Edelman and Montreal-based Dominion Textile Inc. sweetened their hostile bid to acquire Burlington Industries Inc. to $72 a share from $67 a share.    The revised offer, made late Friday, came hours after an announcement by Greensboro, N.C.-based Burlington that it had begun &quot;preliminary discussions&quot; with &quot;third parties&quot; in connection with a possible restructuring. Burlington confirmed reports that those parties include certain leveraged buyout groups, and that any transaction could include members of the textile maker's management.    As previously reported, advisers representing Burlington are understood to have spoken with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., Forstmann Little andamp; Co. and Gibbons Green Van Amerongen, all New York-based leveraged buyout companies. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Although Burlington previously stated it was considering various restructuring options, its disclosure Friday that it had talked with certain unidentified parties for the first time pushed the company's stock above the $67-a-share price that the Edelman-Dominion partnership offered May 5.    Burlington stock surged even higher later that day on the news that the partnership had boosted its bid. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Burlington shares closed at $71.50, up $5.875, on volume of 1.5 million shares.    A company spokesman said Burlington would review &quot;in due time&quot; the sweetened bid. The Edelman-Dominion partnership has already acquired the equivalent of 13.4% of the 27.3 million Burlington shares outstanding. That gives the proposed transaction a value of $1.7 billion.    In a letter to Mr. Edelman and Dominion last week, Burlington said that if the partnership terminated the tender offer begun earlier this month, Burlington would provide the same &quot;confidential information&quot; to the partnership that it provided to other parties.    &quot;That is the 'level and illuminated playing field' you stated you desire,&quot; the letter said. &quot;If you truly wish to negotiate with Burlington on the same terms and conditions as the other parties, it will be necessary for you to first terminate your tender offer.&quot;    But Mr. Edelman called Burlington's request &quot;unreasonable&quot; because it required that the partnership sign a one-year pact agreeing not to buy or sell any Burlington stock without the permission of the company's board. &quot;It should be evident by now that we want to own the company,&quot; Mr. Edelman said.    Burlington said it required all of the parties who have received data to sign a standstill pact. &quot;If Asher Edelman takes exception, it would seem to indicate that he is not serious about negotiating,&quot; a Burlington spokesman said.    An individual familiar with Burlington's defense strategy said that Burlington is &quot;overjoyed&quot; that the partnership's bid for the company has risen 20% since last month, when Mr. Edelman and Dominion offered to buy Burlington for $60 a share. &quot;This just goes to show that they were trying to steal the company.&quot;    The individual said, however, that it was unlikely that Mr. Edelman and Dominon would succeed in their bid. &quot;We think that we can do better than $72 by restructuring,&quot; he said.    Mr. Edelman and Dominion appear to have the upper hand. With a tender offer on the table, other potential buyers may not have enough time to evaluate Burlington. One source close to the company acknowledged that other bidders will &quot;discount what they'll pay to buy the company&quot; if they don't have &quot;several months&quot; to scrutinize Burlington's operations.    Burlington has on the table an offer to buy back as many as eight million shares for $80 each. The company had said that the share buyback was the first step in a proposed restructuring.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Friday, Burlington said the offer was designed to &quot;preserve the flexibility&quot; of the company while it explores its options. It said in the filing that it is making arrangements to borrow as much as $1.3 billion in connection with the buyback.    Burlington said it needs $650.6 million to buy the shares and pay related fees. However, it said it will require $816 million to complete the transaction because repurchasing the shares violates covenants of certain of its debt instruments. The $816 million would include the cost of refinancing the affected debt.    The company said that money borrowed will be refinanced or repaid from funds generated internally by the company, or from other sources, including proceeds of the sale of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets.    According to the filing, Burlington had about $400.3 million in long-term debt outstanding as of March 28. </TEXT></DOC>
