Then ChipSoft's TurboTax Personal is your best bet.andP;  Theprofessional version of this program, TurboTax Professional, has a hugeinstalled base among accountants, so your personal files can 6e importeddirectly into your accountant's PC.andM;Personal Tax PreparerandM;Personal Tax Preparer, from Parsons Technology, is not only a fine package inits own right, but it also offers an easy-to-use facility for cutting andpasting data from Parsons' MoneyCounts accounting/checkbook program, whichmakes it ideal if you run a home-based business.andM;TAXCUTandM;List price: $89.95; upgrade from 1989 version, $49.95; state versions, $39.95each.andP;  Meca Software Inc., 327 Riverside Ave., Westport, CT 06880; (203)222-9150.andM;Andrew Tobias' TaxCut earned our admiration last year as the finest personaltax-preparation package on the market-and this year it's done it again.andP;  Fromthe moment you're greeted by its patriotic red, white, and blue screen untilyou do your final recalc and &quot;audit&quot; your return for errors, you'll feel thatyou're in capable hands.andM;And you are.andP;  The Expert built into the program was written by Boston taxlawyer Dan Caine, the author of Ask Dan About Your Taxes, TaxCut's precursor.andO;This year, Caine has packed even more tax advice into the program.andP;  You'llalso find mouse support, hassle-free imports from Meca's Managing Your Moneyand Intuit's Quicken (see next page), and support for CenterPiece Software'sLaser Link, an $11.99 soft-fonts package that outputs your finished form inIRS style.andM;State returns are also easier to complete with TaxCut this year, as Meca nowoffers tax programs for 10 states: California, Illinois, Maryland,Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, andVirginia.andM;The first time you load TaxCut, you're taken through an online tutorial.andO;Read it.andP;  The tutorial tells you how to use the program and offers a road mapfor completing your return.andP;  Unless you're a 1040 power user who'scomfortable working right on the form, following the road map mill save youtime and headaches.andM;When you begin your return, you can start with the Shoebox, a marvelousfeature that recognizes where most of us keep our records-in a figurative, ifnot literal, shoebox.andP;  The Shoebox lets you enter data randomly fromreceipts, canceled cheeks, and statements; it figures out where the numbersshould go and offers to jump instantly to the correct line on the appropriateform.andM;At any stage, you can ask the Expert for advice through an Interviewprocedure.andP;  The advice you get, which is mercifully free of IRS jargon, isbased on the nature of your responses to the Expert's questions, making thisa very context-sensitive utility.andP;  For example, the Expert can determine whois entitled to claim an exemption in the event of joint custody.andM;TaxCut also includes features that help you prepare forms at yourconvenience.andP;  The Checklist records your answers to a series of yes-or-noquestions and, based on your responses, marks the information you need toinclude in your return, by IRS form and topic.andP;  Once you have the data inhand, you can select the appropriate topic from a list, and TaxCut will jumpdirectly to the form.andM;When you've completed your filing, you can run TaxCut's online Auditor, whichalerts you to missing data, math errors, and any deductions that are likelyto invite the IRS's attention.andM;Finally, if the advice given by the Expert proves to be poor and you end upowing a penalty, Meca will pay it.andM;Sylvia Porter's RapidtaxandM;List price: $79.99; regional state editions, $49.95 each.andM;DacEasy Inc., 17950 Preston Road, Suite 800, Dallas, TX 75252; (800)877-8088, (214) 248-0305.andM;When it comes to handling state filings, Sylvia Porter's RapidTax reallyshines.andP;  It offers 40 state forms in five optional &quot;regional editions&quot; for$49.95 each-a great deal for anyone filing returns in neighboring states.andM;Another nice touch is the Questionnaire, which resembles TaxCut's Checklist.andO;It asks you a series of questions and, based on your answers, determineswhich forms you should be filing.andP;  RapidTax's online adviser will then walkyou through each line of each form, offering advice and information along theway.andM;RapidTax incorporates other good ideas that TaxCut pioneered, including anauditor that flags mistakes in judgment and mathematical errors.andP;  Try to getaway with deducting more than $500 in charitable contributions, and RapidTaxwill tell you that you're inviting an audit and ask if you want to changeyour mind.andM;For those who plan to have an accountant complete their filing, RapidTax,like TurboTax, offers a professional version that can read data from thepersonal version.andM;While there's much to laud, there are drawbacks as well.andP;  RapidTax's advicesimply isn't as far-reaching or as easy to understand as TaxCut's, althoughit's better than that offered by TurboTax and Personal Tax Preparer.andM;Strangest of all, the program can't import data from personal-finance oraccounting programs, something the other programs reviewed here can do.andP;  Thisis particularly odd considering that RapidTax includes a copy of DacEasyLight, DacEasy's bookkeeping program.andP;  RapidTax's packaging promises to linkthe two for 1991.andP;  If DacEasy makes good on this and improves the program'sadvice, RapidTax could be the best of next year's bunch.andM;Turbotax PersonalandM;List price: $75 upgrade from 1989 version, $37.50; state editions, $40 each,upgrade $25.andP;  ChipSoft, P.O. Box 85709, San Diego, CA 92186; (619) 453-8722.andM;If you plan to have your return reviewed by an accountant or taxprofessional, chances are he or she uses TurboTax Professional.andP;  If so, yourTurboTax Personal files can be imported directly into the professional's PC.andM;In addition to this advantage, TurboTax's audit detector (like TaxCut's andRapidTax's) flags items that are likely to invite an IRS audit.andP;  TurboTaxalso lets you cheek national averages to see how you compare with othertaxpayers in your bracket.andM;TurboTax's most extensive feature-the ability to import financial data fromQuicken, Dollars and Sense, and Managing Your Money to the place it shouldappear in your IRS filing-is also its most maddening.andP;  You must code eachitem you import to assure that it arrives where it's supposed to on yourreturn-a frustrating task.andM;The program offers a wealth of optional state packages, though (44altogether).andP;  There's also a Wysiwyg preview screen that displays your returnas it would appear on an IRS form.andP;  But TurboTax doesn't support theCenterPiece soft fonts that produce IRS-like printouts, so you're unable toprint a form.andM;Also, don't expect easy-to-understand tax advice.andP;  ChipSoft does, however,offer an impressive support network.andP;  Tech-support personnel answer questionsyear-round on weekdays and on Saturdays and Sundays during tax season.andO;ChipSoft, also has a toll-free fax line, a company bulletin board, and forumson GEnie and CompuServe.andM;Personal Tax PreparerandM;List price: $49.andP;  Parsons Technology, 375 Collins Road NE,andM;P.O.andP;  Box 3120, Cedar Rapids, IA 52406;andM;(800) 223-6925.andM;Need a low-cost tax program that works well with a similarly low-costaccounting package? Then Personal Tax Preparer is for you.andP;  When used withMoneyCounts, Parsons' $35 accounting/checkbook program, you can import datato your tax form without the extensive coding that TurboTax requires.andP;  Yourability to import data from another accounting program will depend on howwell that program exports reports in ASCII format.andM;As with TurboTax, the main drawback to Personal Tax Preparer is itsreluctance to dispense online tax advice-it can't match the advice found inTaxCut and RapidTax.andP;  However, it does offer the same audit alert andelectronic filing features as the other programs.andP;  Surprisingly for a programpriced considerably low, Personal Tax Preparer gives you a pop-up&quot;mini-spreadsheet&quot; and math and depreciation calculators.andM;Personal Tax Prepare's Interview is the most conversational and jargon-free.andO;It poses questions and, from your answers, determines the forms and schedulesyou'll need.andP;  Like the other programs reviewed here, it lets you record allyour information through the menu-driven Interview and avoid working directlyfrom the forms.andM;Personal Tax Preparer's ability to read files directly from MoneyCounts setsit apart as a good choice for home-based businesspeople.andP;  Together, PersonalTax Preparer and MoneyCounts represent the best low-cost tax and accountingcombination you can buy.andP;  Managing Your Money and Quicken Lot TaxCut ImportDaft in a Snap Paying taxes is painful enough, but when you add to it theaggravation of sorting through mountains of receipts and canceled checks,it's no wonder aspirin sales skyrocket in early April.andM;But if you use Managing Your Money or Quicken to track your personal financesand TaxCut to do your taxes, the job of sorting is almost hassle-free.andM;TaxCut includes an import utility that collects data from the budgetcategories in Managing Your Money and Quicken and drops it directly into theappropriate lines on your tax forms.andP;  Other tax-preparation programs, such asTurboTax, have similar import features, but none plucks the data from financepackages as simply and easily as TaxCut.andM;If you use Managing Your Money Version 7.0, moving data from one package toanother is as easy as clicking on a menu selection in TaxCut's Tools menu.andO;Managing Your Money Version 6.0 requires only slightly more work: You need torun the Connection utility in TaxCut, a process that takes about five minutesof answering questions and a quick trip to the coffee pot while the utilityconverts the data.andM;Converting data from Quicken is a bit more tricky, though it hardly con beconsidered a chore.andP;  Quicken has a reporting function that summarizes budgetdata into a tax report.andP;  Once you've created this report and saved it to diskin a .PRN file, you've done most of the conversion work.andP;  TaxCut reads the.PRN file, pulls data from the report, and places it into the appropriateblanks on your tax forms.andM;To get the most out of TaxCut's import utility, however, you must bereligious about assigning payments to budget categories within Managing YourMoney or Quicken.andP;  If you just write and print checks, never paying attentionto budget allocations for outgoing money, you'll need to spend some time inyour check archives assigning payments to budget and tax categories.andM;it's worth the effort.andP;  Once data has been moved from your finance program toTaxCut, you're halfway to completing your return.andP;  And that, after all, isbetter than a Saturday afternoon spent sorting canceled checks on the livingroom floor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
