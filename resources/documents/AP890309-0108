Lake View Terrace residents who have opposed the Nancy ReaganCenter, fearing it would increase crime and lower property values,said they would appeal Wednesday's ruling by a Los Angeles Countyzoning official.   ``It seems as if they make it a fortress, it will beacceptable,'' said Lew Snow, vice president of the community'shomeowners association. ``It won't.''   Zoning Administrator Darryl Fisher said homeowner fears aboutcrime and lower property values, while understandable, were based onmisinformation and a lack of understanding of the proposal for thecenter 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles.   However, he imposed 22 conditions on the permit, includingrequirements to build a 7-foot security fence, use only one entrancestaffed 24 hours with a guard and employ a video security system.   Officials at Phoenix House, the nonprofit agency proposing thecenter, said they were encouraged by the ruling but objected to someof the conditions, including the permit's two-year limit.   ``That could have an incredible impact,'' said Larraine Mohr,Phoenix House senior vice president.   Phoenix House, which operates 10 facilities across the country,has proposed a residential high school and treatment center for asmany as 150 teen-agers and 60 young adults, plus a research andeducation center.</TEXT></DOC>
