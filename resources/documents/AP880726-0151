Each promised a different menu of tax breaks, to be phased outif prices rise, to help domestic oil and gas drillers.   George Bush ``feels strongly one of the ways we can solve thistremendous import problem is by playing the gas card,'' said RobertMosbacher Sr., the Bush campaign finance chairman and Houstonindependent oil and gas producer.   Michael Dukakis ``is going to be somebody who is absolutely thestrongest advocate of natural gas we have ever had in thiscountry,'' said John Sharp, chairman of the candidate's Texascampaign.   Mosbacher referred to the growing dependence on imported crudeoil and refined products, now more than 41 percent of consumptioncompared with 35 percent a year ago.   Many domestic producers have advocated a tariff on oil imports,but neither man mentioned such a measure in brief speeches beforethe Natural Gas Roundtable, a monthly luncheon sponsored by gastrade associations.   Despite low prices, the country is not consuming all availablenatural gas. Consumption last year was 25 percent below the 1972peak and according to industry estimates at least 10 percent to 15percent below what could be easily delivered from existing wells.   Bush would use natural gas for transportation, both as a vehiclefuel in its own right and a source for methanol, Mosbacher said.This would help air pollution problems in cities where the strategyis followed, he said.   His package of tax breaks, some of which would restore taxtreatment of some oil and gas practices to what it was before the1986 income tax changes, would be ``phased out as the industryrecovers and prices rise,'' Mosbacher said.   Mosbacher said offshore oil drilling, which Dukakis has said heopposes in environmentally sensitive areas, and nuclear energy mustbe part of the nation's energy future. Dukakis opposes furtherconstruction of reactors until waste disposal questions are solvedand a new design is available.   Bush would grant tax credits for exploration expenses and wouldseek certain exemptions from application of the alternative minimumtax, Mosbacher said.   Dukakis is exploring a ``strategic natural gas reserve,'' in theform of underground storage dispersed around the country, Sharpsaid. Though many gas companies maintain storage, a nationalprogram would help counter fears of a resumption of the shortagesof the late 1970s, he said.   Dukakis also is considering a $5 per barrel premium forpurchases from new domestic wells for the strategic petroleumreserve, Sharp said. In some recent years Mexico has supplied allthe oil for the reserve and domestic producers have been reluctantto bid.</TEXT></DOC>
