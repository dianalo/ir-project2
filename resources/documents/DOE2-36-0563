The previous work in the developmentof operator aids for fault diagnosis has focused on detecting and diagnosingprocess anomalies. The most significant advances in the application ofexpert systems to process diagnostics has involved construction of computermodels with interconnecting nodes. General principles of the plant processare used to isolate the cause of a possible anomaly to one of the nodes.Another approach to process diagnosis is to identify the cause of a possibleanomaly with an event-cause model of the process. We describe a methodof signal validation using expert system technology which detects possibleanomalies in an instrument channel's output, similar to the procedureused by an operator.</TEXT></DOC>
