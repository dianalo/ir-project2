WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is winning supportin Congress for much of his broad plan to curb political influencein distributing housing subsidies.   Kemp on Tuesday unveiled a 58-point plan to clean up theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, which would eliminatespending at the secretary's discretion and impose new managementand ethics regulations.   ``Many past funding decisions were, frankly, based on politicalinfluence rather than merit,'' Kemp said. ``Under my stewardship,no decisions will be made at HUD for the political advantage orpersonal gain of any one person or of a political party.''   Kemp, in announcing his program, said he did not believe theappointment of a special prosecutor was necessary to investigateallegations of past influence-peddling at the agency.   Kemp's predecessor, Samuel R. Pierce Jr., and three of Pierce'sformer top assistants have refused to testify before Congress,citing their constitutional rights against self-incrimination.   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the chairman of a House subcommitteethat is investigating fraud and mismanagement at HUD during theReagan administration, said he supported most of Kemp's plan.   ``I believe Secretary Kemp is on the right track,'' Lantos saidafter meeting with Kemp.   But Lantos said he was not ready to go along with Kemp'ssuggestion that there is no need for the Section 8 ModerateRehabilitation Program. The program has been at the center of theHUD scandals, and Lantos says it was plundered by politicalinsiders during the Reagan administration.   ``It's extremely important we do not allow the scandal duringthe previous administration ... to drive us into giving up thegoal, which is to provide affordable, safe, healthy, reasonablehousing for tens of millions of American families,'' Lantos said.   Lantos' reluctance reflected the program's past support amongcongressional Democrats. Although Republicans have been accused ofabusing the program under Pierce, the Reagan administration hadrecommended the program be killed and it was congressionalDemocrats who annually kept it alive.   Kemp's proposed changes range from regulatory and administrativesteps he can take immediately to more complex changes that willrequire congressional approval.   Many of the proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984General Accounting Office report to Congress, while others weremolded after more recent proposals in Congress and by Kemp aides tolimit the role of lobbyists and consultants in government fundingdecisions.   Kemp proposed killing another program, HUD's Title X landdevelopment insurance, citing use of the money to build upscaleprojects such as a condominium-golf complex in California.   He said he was committed, however, to maintaining HUD'sco-insurance program, which has been the source of nearly $1billion in sour loans to date. The program allows private lendersto approve HUD-insured mortgages and was a major part of the Reaganadministration's efforts to contract federal work to privatecontractors.   ``The problem was not the idea,'' Kemp said. ``The problem wasin the implementation of the idea.''   Kemp barred from HUD work one company, DRG Funding Corp., whichhas had defaults on $709 million of the $1.1 billion in HUD-insuredloans it approved.   Other highlights include:   _Appointment of a HUD chief financial officer and a separatecomptroller for its Federal Housing Administration, whose loanprograms have been troubled by fraud and mismanagement believed tohave cost more than $4 billion.   _Requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on HUDproposals to register with the department and disclose their fees,which HUD could deduct from any funding awards. Kemp asked Congressto impose civil fines of up to $10,000 for violations of theregistration requirement. He also proposed similar fines for HUDemployees who disclose funding decisions prior to publicannouncements.   _Publishing all HUD funding decisions and waivers in the FederalRegister. Many projects cited in the April audit received waiversallowing them to receive rent subsidies above HUD limits.   _Allocating up to $100 million for monitoring HUD housing andcommunity development programs. Kemp said the department spendsless than $25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10times that amount.   _Increasing the staff of the department's inspector general andgranting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for itsinvestigations.</TEXT></DOC>
