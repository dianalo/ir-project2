In Bonn, West German officials acknowledged they were makinglittle progress in changing the minds of Communist East Germanleaders who intervened with Hungarian authorities to block thedeparture of about 5,500 refugees.   East German officials on Tuesday set up camp outside a tentcommunity in Budapest sheltering many of the would-be emigres andbegan trying to persuade them to return to East Germany. Therefugees hope to cross Austria and enter West Germany, where theywill automatically receive citizenship.   The latest escape involved more refugees than those of recentdays, when increased Hungarian border patrols and prospects of animminent sponsored exodus apparently deterred East Germans fromfleeing illegally to Austria.   Austrian Red Cross officials said the 30 East Germans made itacross the border, where Hungary began dismantling fortifications inMay but still maintains some stretches of barbed wire and otherbarriers.   In Budapest, refugees gathered near a brown-and-white trailer ofthe East German Embassy towed into place across the road from theircamp.   But none approached the door in the first hour, and several ofthose waiting to leave for Austria and then West Germany deridedtheir hard-line Communist country's attempts to win them back.   ``They must really be stupid to come here,'' said a heavy-setEast German who was among the first to set up residence at theZugliget tent camp when it opened mid-August. ``But I guess theyhave no choice, it's either victory or Siberia for them.''   ``It's a disgrace,'' yelled a woman in another small group. ``Noone is going to go in there anyway.''   Relief worker Csilla Von Boeselager said camp residents have beenasked to refrain from ``unwise actions'' against the East Germandiplomats or their trailer.   First Secretary Dieter Grahmann of the East German Embassy toldreporters crowding their trailer that any refugees were free ``todiscuss the situation'' with him or Second Secretary WolfgangForster.   East Germany increased efforts Tuesday to persuade the refugeesto return home, with Grahmann handing out leaflets promising nopenalties for those who give up their quest to go West.   He retreated after being mobbed by a hostile crowd.   West German government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters inBonn today, ``There is no indication that East Germany is preparedto change its position.'' He would not say when the refugees mightbe allowed to leave.   However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said the WestGerman government remains confident a solution can be found soon.   ``The Hungarian government knows how urgent a solution is,'' hesaid. ``We are convinced that a humanitarian solution will followsoon.   Several refugees told reporters today that they are resigned tolong stays in Hungary, after officials deflated hopes that theirdeparture for West Germany was imminent.   ``They're going to let us out anyway; there's no reason fordesperation,'' said one refugee. ``I've waited to leave for the Westfor seven years at home, another few months won't matter.''   With legal travel difficult to the West but relatively easy toHungary, a liberal Soviet bloc country, East Germans began fleeingfrom Hungary to Austria in droves after Hungary removed some wirebarriers and observation posts from its 120-mile western border.   Hungary has defied a bilateral agreement with East Germany andrefused to send back East Germans trying to flee their homeland.   West German politicians said last week the Hungarian leadershipalso has promised to let would-be emigres go to West Germany, whichgrants them automatic citizenship and generous social benefits.   Expectations were heightened last week when West Germanauthorities built five tent cities to house the East Germans inBavaria. But senior Hungarian officials cautioned Monday and Tuesdaythat departure could be weeks away because Hungary still is seekinggrudging East German agreement.   Peter Dickscheidt of the West German Maltesian Aid Organizationsaid about 5,500 would-be emigres were registered by early today atthe four Budapest camps and a fifth on Balaton Lake, 90 milessouthwest of the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
