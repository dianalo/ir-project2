LaRouche's conspiracy trial in Boston ended in a mistrialearlier this month when the presiding judge excused four jurors whocomplained, after six months, about its slow pace. Federalprosecutors hope to bring LaRouche to trial a second time inOctober.   Juror-caused mistrials get lots of attention but they are rare,say experts who point to lawyer strategy _ not jurorirresponsibility _ as the culprit in most such cases.   A jury's tribulations do not slow the wheels of justice in thevast majority of the 300,000 jury trials held in state and federalcourts each year, the experts say.   Statistics on mistrials caused by hung juries or other problemsin the jury box are elusive, said Tom Munsterman of the jurystudies center of the National Center for State Courts. But he saidthe numbers are sure to be ``negligible.''   ``When a mistrial occurs, it's usually in a big trial that'sgoing to last more than a few days,'' Munsterman said. ``It oftenis a publicized case, so the public gets the impression thatmistrials occur more frequently than they do.''   He added, ``It's when you get a case like the LaRouche case or abig narcotics-conspiracy case where problems can arise.''   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche organizations are chargedwith conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation intoallegations that his 1984 presidential campaign reaped more than $2million through credit card and loan fraud.   The trial, which had begun in December, was proceeding veryslowly. Testimony was all but halted in March for hearings onwhether prosecutors deliberately withheld evidence from the defense.   When U.S. District Judge Robert S. Keeton resumed testimony,several jurors complained they had been told the trial would lastonly six months. They said continuing through the summer would posehardships. Keeton said he had no choice but to declare a mistrial.   He has set a second trial date for Oct. 3. But he first willhear arguments by defense lawyers that the mistrial was thegovernment's fault and a new trial would represent impermissibledouble jeopardy.   Joe S. Cecil of the Federal Judicial Center said the mistrial inLaRouche's case cannot be pinned to the jury. ``Litigation strategydisrupted the flow of the trial,'' he said.   Cecil was one of the authors of a survey report last yearindicating that jurors are willing to tackle complex cases even ifthey result in lengthy trials.   Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger warned in a 1979 speechthat juries may not be able to cope with the increasingly complexlegal issues and the mass of complicated information introduced attrials.   Burger also voiced concern about the fairness of requiringcitizens to serve on juries for extended periods of time.   But the Federal Judicial Center's report said, ``A majority ofjurors from both long and short trials reported that their serviceinterfered `very little' or `not at all' with their normal life,and no significant difference emerged on this item between theresponses of long-trial jurors and the responses of short-trialjurors.''   It added that more than four-fifths of jurors who had served inboth long and short trials said they were willing to serve on thecase if they had to do it over again.   ``Even among those jurors who said their service had interfereda great deal with their normal life, more than 60 percent said theywould be willing to serve if they were called again for juryduty,'' the report said.   ``While (the perceptions of) jurors in long and short trials maydiffer, the differences are not great in magnitude and are offsetsomewhat by the seriousness with which all jurors approach theirtask,'' the report concluded.</TEXT></DOC>
