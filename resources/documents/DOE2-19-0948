Using an updated, least-costdeposition-constrained deterministic model as a basic framework, threemultiobjective models are developed that consist of formulations whichpermit deviations about target deposition levels, the addition of constraintsto effect measures of equity and models to enforce restrictions on aggregateemission reduction tonnage. The deposition deviation model shows thatlarge abatement cost savings can be realized if the hard upper boundon maximum allowable deposition limit is preferentially relaxed. Thesocalled equity model develops strategies that attempt to balance withineach state and province, the disparity between fracional emission andfractional deposition reductions. The aggregate emission reduction modelshows some of the effects associated with the imposition of a commontype of acid rain proposal. Our intent is to demonstrate that the incorporationof multiobjectivity into mathematical programming models for optimizingacid rain control constitutes an important step toward the identificationof more representative, more useful and hopefully, scientifically andpolitically acceptable abatement strategies. 6 figs., 18 refs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
