The union represents 32,000 teachers, librarians, nurses andcounselors in the nation's second-largest school district, withabout 22,000 of them dues-paying members of the union. The districthas 594,000 students.   The strike is the largest by teachers since 28,000 Chicagoteachers struck in the 1987-88 school year, affecting 430,000students.   According to the National Education Association, the nation'slargest teachers union, only seven states allow teachers to strikewithout the risk of penalties: Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio,Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.   An additional 13 allow teachers to strike at the risk of beingpenalized. They are Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland,Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, NorthDakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee.   ``It's pretty murky,'' Carey said when asked to describeCalifornia laws governing teacher strikes.   She said strikes were allowed if the union and school boardfirst went through mediation and a fact-finding process andteachers honored a mandatory 10-day cooling off period after thefact-finder issued a report.   Such a report was due Monday in the Los Angeles impasse, but thefact-finder requested a two-day extension. The union had set a May30 strike deadline, which would have allowed the 10-day cooling offperiod, but moved the deadline to Monday when SuperintendentLeonard Britton refused to authorize pay for teachers who failed toturn in final grades by Monday.   ``He kind of moved things up on us,'' Carey said. ``We wereplanning to be legal. ... We'll let the powers that be and thecourts decide whether we're legal or illegal. If it's deemedillegal, we're willing to pay the penalty.''   The California Public Employee Relations Board said last weekthat teachers would be violating the law if they struck Monday. Butschool officials have given no indication that they plan to takelegal action against the strikers.   Carolyn Wallace, an official at the NEA's national headquartershere who tracks teacher strikes, said there had been 68 nationwideas of April 20.   ``It's very rare,'' she said when asked about the timing of theLos Angeles strike, which came five weeks before the end of theschool year.   The Public Policy Research Foundation, a conservativeorganization that publishes a newsletter on developments in publicemployee unions, said its preliminary data showed there have been71 teacher strikes this year in 12 states, not including the LosAngeles walkout. There were 19,647 teachers involved in all ofthose strikes combined _ fewer than in Los Angeles _ and 250,337students were idled, according to the foundation, which countsstudents as being affected by a strike only if schools are closedfor more than one day.   Wallace said the foundation figures include strikes bynon-teaching support personnel.</TEXT></DOC>
