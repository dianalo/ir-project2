As reported last October, Beatrice, which was taken private in April 1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout, is readying a public offering for its huge food businesses. Industry sources expect that offering in late 1987.    Sources close to the company said Donald P. Kelly, who last year was named Beatrice chairman by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which led the buyout, plans to take the company's non-food businesses public in the next few weeks to benefit from the current warm investor climate for new offerings. The non-food businesses had sales of $1.2 billion in the year ended Feb. 28, 1987, representing about 13% of Beatrice's total.    Mr. Kelly plans to assume control of the non-food company, the sources said, gradually shedding some lines and perhaps adding others in building an independent Chicago-based conglomerate. Beatrice would be led by its current No. 2 executive, Kelly protege Frederick Rentschler. Sources said Mr. Rentschler plans to move the food company's headquarters from Chicago to Phoenix, Ariz., where he has a home, or near the Hunt-Wesson division in Fullerton, Calif.    Sources said the non-food company would be named Esmark International Inc. Mr. Kelly was chairman and chief executive of Esmark Inc. when it was acquired by Beatrice in 1984.    Beatrice executives declined to comment.    The company's remaining non-food businesses include Stiffel lamps, Samsonite luggage and its Culligan water softener business. Its food core includes Swift meats, Hunt's tomato products and Wesson cooking oil.    A non-food offering would continue Beatrice's strategy of stripping to its food core. Among the non-food businesses Beatrice has sold separately in the last year are its International Playtex Inc. personal products division, its Avis Inc. car-rental unit and its Americold refrigerated warehouse business.    Beatrice wants to further pare its debt from the leveraged buyout -- currently about $4.3 billion -- before going public, sources said. As reported, Beatrice is reducing that debt so fast that it could reach the pre-buyout level of $2 billion by July.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
