(ODS) recently began shipping a fiber-opticconverter that can extend distances between FDDI networks by as much as 45kilometers (km), according to a company official.andM;The new ODS 384 converts multimode cabling specified in the forthcoming FDDIstandard -- which is limited to distances of 2 km between fiber nodes -- intosingle-mode fiber optics spanning as much as 45 km, said Joe Head, seniorvice president of the Richardson, Texas, company.andM;ODS converters placed at each end of the cable eliminate the need for an FDDIbridge or a T-1 line while maintaining the 100M-bps throughput rates of FDDInetworks, he said.andM;The ODS 384 also includes an RS-232 serial port for remote networkmanagement.andP;  Users can dial into the converter via a modem to view the statusof LEDs and perform remote loopback for link testing.andM;The ODS 384 works with third-party vendors' FDDI cards and other networkproducts.andP;  It is the first in a series of FDDI products from ODS, with futureproducts to include hubs and bridges, according to Head.andM;The ODS 384 includes an FDDI signal repeater equipped with a retiming devicethat reduces jitter or network noise.andM;The ODS 384, priced at $6,495, is available directly from the company.andM;ODS can be reached at (214) 234-6400.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
