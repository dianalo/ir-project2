This is a victory forall of you, the people of Costa Rica,'' Calderon, a strongsupporter of U.S. policy in the region, said in a statement at hisSocial Christian party headquarters.   Calderon was leading Carlos Manuel Castillo by 178,571 votes to169,352, according to official returns representing about 20percent of the vote. The count was suspended for the night and wasto resume at noon Monday.   ``I accept the verdict of the people. Today we have electedliberty and democracy to the presidency of Costa Rica,'' Castillosaid in a concession statement at the National Liberation party'selection headquarters.   Most of the tabulated returns came from Castillo's stronghold ofSan Jose, and Calderon was expected to expand his lead when thevotes from his rural strongholds started coming in.   More than 80 percent of the nation's 1.7 million registeredvoters were expected to turn out.   Calderon will take office May 8 for a four-year term.   Arias, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts tobring peace to Central America, cannot succeed himself.   Calderon's victory marked the 10th straight peaceful election inCosta Rica since 1948, when Calderon's father, Rafael AngelCalderon Guardia, was president and tried to nullify the resultwhen his party lost.   ``My sympathy goes out to my opponent, Mr. Castillo, and hisfollowers. I know what they are going through. I went through itfour years ago,'' said Calderon, 40, who made losing presidentialbids in 1982 and 1986.   He asked his followers to celebrate without gloating or rancorand called on ``those who did not vote for me to join us and fightfor a better future for Costa Rica.''   Party faithful were out in force, waving flags and honking hornsin rhythm. Buses took thousands to the polls, where crowds ofteen-agers decked out in colorful T-shirts guided voters to theirprecincts.   Some who celebrated Saturday night were lined up at 5 a.m. whenthe polls opened. Police blocked streets near hospitals to holddown the sound of a festival that jammed streets of the capitalthroughout the day and continued after the polls closed.   The fiesta continued into the night for Calderon's supporters.   Both major candidates ran populist campaigns aimed at the poorin this country of 2.9 million. The campaign was devoid ofspecifics, however.   Castillo was hurt by disclosures about drug trafficking andcorruption, but in keeping with the tradition of Costa Ricanpolitics, Calderon did not press those issues as hard as he mighthave.   Calderon founded the Social Christian party in part to shed thelegacy of his father.   But the president-elect still calls his father, who served aspresident from 1940 to 1944, the greatest Costa Rican president ofthis century. The elder Calderon was exiled after he tried tonullify the 1948 election results, an incident that led to theabolition of Costa Rica's army.   Calderon has said he supports Arias' peace efforts but won't tryto imitate them, and will focus on domestic issues and ``improvingsocial justice.''   Calderon, whose father founded Costa Rica's social securitysystem, has promised a new housing program for the poor while atthe same time saying he would reduce the government's deficitspending.   He also has proposed requiring large companies to establishprofit-sharing plans, something that has made some businessmennervous.   Voters also elected 57 national assembly delegates and filled525 municipal posts.   Prisoners, each escorted by a guard, were permitted to vote forthe first time in Costa Rican history.   ``It's a step towards the perfection of Costa Rican democracy,''said human rights advocate Nancy Hernandez.   In an exercise to reinforce the understanding of and commitmentto democracy, more than 9,500 children under age 12 went to theirown polling places in a mock election and Castillo won, taking4,885 votes, or 50.6 percent, to 4,693, or 48.6 percent, forCalderon.   The voting took place only in San Jose, where the incumbentparty is strong.   Joao Baena Soares, secretary general of the Organization ofAmerican States, praised Costa Rica's democratic tradition butrefused to compare it to Nicaragua, where a controversial campaignwinds up on Feb. 25.   He noted, however, that the OAS sent only four observers,including himself, to Costa Rica. On election day in Nicaraguathere will be 400 OAS observers, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
