SAI 386/33 SAI Systems Laboratory really wantsyou to buy one of its computers.andP;  The company's functional base machine, a$1,995 system fitted with 1MB RAM, 40MB hard disk, and monochrome display,makes the SAI 386/33 seem like low-cost booty of the 386 dollar war.andP;  Evenwith a configuration upgrade to PC Magazine's standard 4MB of RAM, 64K RAMcache, a 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppy, a 150MB hard disk, a Super VGA displaysetup, and DOS 4.01, SAI's 33-MHz machine is a comparative steal at $3,395.andM;Make no mistake, this is a no-frills computer.andP;  The case is a standard AT boxwith five half-height bays, three of which have front access.andP;  Its standardreset and turbo buttons are controlled from the front panel.andP;  Power for the386/33 is supplied by a 200-watt Le Amatic unit.andP;  Take the cover off andyou'll find evidence of major diagonal flex in the chassis.andP;  As with any mailorder computer, you are well advised to remove the cover and check that allof the boards and chips are firmly seated in their slots and sockets.andM;Inside the case you'll find an 80-Data motherboard with two 8-bit and six16-bit slots.andP;  The installed VGA card, disk controller, and I/O board leavefive slots available for expansion.andP;  Discrete components take the place of alarge scale integrated 80386 chip set, but AMI BIOS chips are plainly visiblefor those who need the comfort of a name brand.andP;  Likewise, an Intel 82386cache controller directs the 64K of 20-nanosecond cache RAM that link theprocessor to the installed 4MB of 80-ns.andP;  system RAM.andP;  The motherboard willhandle 8MB of system RAM in SIP configuration before you'll need to resort toan add-in card to take the system up to its 16MB maximum.andM;For review, SAI provided a $300 200MB Conner Peripherals IDE hard disk withthe machine that PC Labs' BIOS Disk Seek test clocked at a 15.88 millisecondaverage access time.andP;  While this is a fast access time, the drive is leashedto an embedded AT controller that hinders the true throughput potential.andP;  SAIoffers 80MB, 150MB, 300MB, and 600MB alternative ESDI drives at $700, $995,$1,895, and $3,295, respectively, that couldn't help but improve accesstimes.andM;Video is the performance bonus from the SAI 386/33.andP;  Although devoid of anyname, the 16-bit VGA card carries a Western Digital chip set and did quitewell on PC Labs' video BIOS scrolling benchmarks with elapsed times of 0.33and 1.04 seconds.andP;  Coupled with the NEC 3D monitor, the display system ismore than adequate for video intensive software applications.andM;Two words describe the SAI 386/33 documentation: slim and none.andP;  Four manualsarrived with the system and it's a stretch to actually call them manuals.andO;Two of them are for the VGA card, one covering the hardware and the otherdescribing the VGA utility software.andP;  NEC's own user manual for the 3Dmonitor was included, of course, and the quartet was completed with a 22-pagedocument describing the various options available on the 80-Data motherboard.andO;You won't find documentation and guidance on system operations and setup.andM;Naturally, none of that will matter if you're one of the personal computingcognoscente.andP;  Indeed, the SAI 386/33 may be best appreciated by those whoneed a limited amount of support.andP;  Its lack of an FCC Class B rating keeps itfrom being a home machine of choice, but it could be a good machine to stockhackers and programmers in your shop.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
