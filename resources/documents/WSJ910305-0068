On the war-torn road to Basra, Iraqi soldiers, still inuniform but usually unarmed, wander along the roadside,rummaging through trash and begging the people in passingcars for water, food and cigarettes. A farmer in a donkeycart moves slowly past smoldering tanks, upturned army trucksand a dead cow. An Egyptian with burlap on his feet heads theother way, toward Kuwait, pushing a shopping cart filled withhis soiled possessions.</LP><TEXT>   Asked if Baghdad still controls southern Iraq, KassimBasrawi shrugs. &quot;There is nothing to control,&quot; the farmersays. &quot;No money, no food, no gasoline.&quot; A barefoot friendruns a finger across his throat. &quot;Saddam is finished,&quot; hesays.   The Iraqi regime may not be done for, but the testimony oftravelers through this shattered region suggests that itscontrol of outlying districts may be crumbling. Hundreds ofrefugees streamed across the border into Kuwait, carryingtales of protest and shootings in almost every major city insouthern Iraq.   Senior Pentagon officials in Washington said conflictswere under way in at least six southern Iraqi cities, withaerial reconnaissance showing buildings and vehicles on fireand military checkpoints set up at strategic intersections.   U.S. officials weren't able to say whether the outbreaksof violence were a threat to Saddam Hussein's rule. But Lt.Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefsof Staff, said the chaos &quot;could conceivably slow us down inbeing able to get our prisoners of war back . . . and couldslow down getting our forces out of Iraq.&quot;   In Basra, Iraqi army T-55 tanks appeared to be involved,as well as more sophisticated T-72 tanks of Saddam Hussein'sRepublican Guard, Gen. Kelly said. But he said it wasn'tclear which tanks were on which side.   Pentagon Spokesman Pete Williams said the violenceappeared to be centered in Basra, the holy city of An Najaf,Az Zubayr, al-Kumayt, al-Amarah and Qalat Salih. Mr. Williamsreferred to the Iraqi government's reaction to the unrest asa &quot;police action,&quot; adding that Iraq's army no longerrepresented an offensive threat to other countries. AnotherDefense Department official added that it would be a &quot;goodassumption&quot; that Iran, which fought an eight-year war withIraq, was involved in some of the turmoil, particularly in AnNajaf.   Most of the refugees coming across into Kuwait wereKuwaitis who had traveled north in search of relatives takenby the Iraqis when they fled. With them were dozens of freedprisoners. Some, with bandaged feet and mangled fingernails,said they had been tortured and then released when riotingIraqi civilians stormed prisons.   Trouble seems to have started almost immediately after thewar's end. Several refugees said that last Thursday, a ShiiteMuslim holiday, police encircled a crowded mosque in the holycity of Karbala because they suspected the religiousgathering had turned political. Police fired their guns inthe air, people rushed out of the mosque in panic and severalapparently were killed in a brief riot.   Salam al-Musfa, a 23-year-old Kuwaiti who was passingthrough Karbala on his way back from Baghdad when theincident occurred, said that people were most upset aboutscarce food and soaring prices. &quot;There is almost nothing toeat,&quot; he said, adding that black market gasoline now sellsfor about $5 a gallon. He said he also saw a young man climbon another's shoulders to paint black streaks across a giantoutdoor portrait of Saddam Hussein.   Further south, refugees say, much larger and bloodierriots broke out in the cities of An Nasiriyah and Basra.Hassan Khalief, a Syrian businessman, was on his way homefrom Kuwait when Nasiriyah exploded Friday. He said peoplewere shouting &quot;Down with Saddam&quot; and that some soldiers werehanding their weapons to rioters while other army units wereresisting the crowd. By Saturday, he said, troops surroundedthe city, but the center &quot;was out of control.&quot;   Many refugees said the protests have a strong Islamicslant. &quot;It's all coming from the Islamic people, who don'taccept the government,&quot; said Saad Abdul Ghani, an Egyptianwho left Nasiriyah early Monday. &quot;There are bodies all overthe streets.&quot;   Some refugees said a prominent Shiite opposition figure,Mohamed Bakir al-Hakim, had returned to Basra from exile inIran to lead the rebellion. They also said that theheadquarters of the ruling Baath Party had been burned andseveral city officials killed.   The official Iranian press agency said that among theofficials killed in Basra by rebellious Iraqi soldiers, manyof whom had retreated from Kuwait, were Saddam Hussein'seldest son, Udai, along with a provincial governor and themayor of Basra. The Iranian agency based its reports oninterviews with refugees streaming into Iran from easternIraq. The Republican Guard reportedly was using tanks andheavy weapons to battle the rebels in Basra, from whereexplosions could be heard 25 miles away in the Iranian cityof Khorramshahr, the Iranian news agency said.   A French reporter, Fabrice Rousselot, who reached theoutskirts of Basra late Sunday, said he saw a long line oftanks with their guns facing the city and heard sporadicgunfire.   Basra, a city of over a million people and thesecond-largest in Iraq, is in many ways a logical place foran uprising against Saddam Hussein's regime to begin. Whilethe Iraqi president, his hard-core supporters and mostresidents of Baghdad are Sunni Muslim, Basra's population isover two-thirds Shiite, and many families have strong ties toIran. Other cities south of Baghdad also are predominantlyShiite. In the early 1980s, this was the heartland ofIranian-backed revolutionary cells that sought to topple theBaathist regime in Baghdad. They were crushed, their leadersjailed or executed and thousands of Shiites exiled to Iran.   The Basrawis also have economic and political reasons forresisting central control. The marshy region of southeasternIraq has always lagged behind the more industrial areassurrounding Baghdad. Though Basra is a key oil port, Iraq'soil wealth has flowed disproportionately north.   Basra also has been the city hardest-hit as a result ofSaddam Hussein's military adventures. When Iraq invaded Iranin 1980, the Iranians quickly retaliated by shelling Basraand made it their principal target throughout the eight-yearwar, at one point reaching within 10 miles of the city. Atwar's end, roughly half the city lay in ruins, and it wasstill being rebuilt when Iraq invaded Kuwait.   As the operation center for the Iraqi military andcivilian occupation of Kuwait, Basra was also a key alliedtarget during the Mideast war and came under fierce aerialbombardment. Moreover, Shiites from southern Iraq made up alarge portion of the front-line troops who suffered underallied guns when the ground combat started.   &quot;We only had to suffer under Saddam for seven months, theyhave had to put up with him for years,&quot; said a Kuwaitibusinessman with family and property in Basra. &quot;It's nowonder they are rising up against Saddam.&quot;   ---   Robert S.
