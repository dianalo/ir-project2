The Middle East Economic Survey quoted Issam Abdul-Rahimal-Chalabi as saying that an increase in the output ceiling shouldend overproduction by some of the organization's 13 members.   Chalabi said that the increase is expected to be formalized at aJune meeting of OPEC ministers and take effect in the second halfof the year. A new output level has not been decided, the ministersaid. However, industry observers expect an increase of about 1.5million barrels a day.   Last November, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesset a production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day in an effortto raise world oil prices, which had fallen to $10 to $12 a barrel.At the time, the cartel was producing in excess of 22 millionbarrels, far more than the market could absorb.   Since then, oil prices have nearly doubled, although severalOPEC members are producing above their quotas, putting the cartelabove its self-imposed limit. OPEC does not want to see prices toohigh lest they encourage non-OPEC producers to increase production.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have both demanded higherquotas and the U.A.E. has consistantly been overproducing sinceNovember, oil sources have reported.   Chalabi warned, however, that there could be no going back onthe principle of equal quotas for Iraq and Iran which fought aneight-year war ending in cease-fire last August. He said Iraq willnot even discuss the matter.   ``We watch very closely whatever production figures come out ofIran,'' he said.   ``If in actual terms there is going to be any productionincrease or quota violation by Iran, then that will be treateddifferently by Iraq.''   Chalabi said Iraq's current refining capacity is 600,000 barelsa day and internal consumption is running at about 300,000 barrelsa day.</TEXT></DOC>
