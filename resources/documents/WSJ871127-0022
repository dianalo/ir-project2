The proposal was condemned as &quot;political and economic blackmail&quot; by the National Union of Mineworkers, the nation's biggest union, which staged a three-week strike earlier this year.    Anglo American said it will issue five shares, valued at about 60 rand ($30.50) apiece, to about 250,000 employees who have worked at the company, or one of its subsidiaries, for more than two years. De Beers Consolidated Mines, Anglo's diamond-mining affiliate, said it will issue 10 shares, valued at about 30 rand apiece, to 20,000 employees.    Several other South African companies are implementing, or considering, employee stock-ownership plans. White business leaders hope such participation will give black workers, who are becoming increasingly militant, a bigger stake in the economy and a greater appreciation of capitalism, which many blacks equate with apartheid.    Gavin Relly, Anglo's chairman, said the stock issue, which will be repeated annually for the next five years, &quot;will enable employees to become involved in the process of wealth creation.&quot;    Even though most stock plans are attractive financially -- Anglo is giving away its shares -- they have run into opposition from black unions.    The National Union of Mineworkers said Anglo American's issue was designed &quot;to ensure that free enterprise is entrenched in a post-apartheid society.&quot; Anglo officials said they hope the union will let members decide individually whether to accept the shares. </TEXT></DOC>
