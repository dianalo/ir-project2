But not everyone has shared equally in these inflation-adjusted gains, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's annual income survey. While the median incomes of households headed by whites rose 6.5% and those by blacks 4.3%, households headed by Hispanics showed an increase of just 2.6% over the period.    The primary reason for this divergence is that the heads of Hispanic households are on average younger than those of white and black households. And the incomes of younger people haven't risen as much as those of middle-aged workers.    Among families (defined by the Census Bureau as households having two or more related people), median income rose to $30,850 from $29,000. At current levels, the median income of families is now $4,850 more than that of the average U.S. household. One reason for this is that married-couple families have seen an 8.8% increase in income over the past seven years, to $34,700 from $31,900, due mostly to the fact that in 56% of such families, both the husband and wife work.    Yet not all family groups have fared so well. Those headed by women, for instance, saw their income inch up only 2.0% during the period, to $14,600 from $14,300.    Who the Affluent Are   And Where They Live   ONLY 6.2% OF all U.S. households have incomes of $75,000 or more, according to recent Census Bureau survey data. That comes to 5.7 million households.    But money isn't the only thing that separates this affluent group from the majority. Education is another. Nearly two-thirds of the heads of these households graduated from college. The national average for all household heads is 22%.    Moreover, affluent families have an average of 2.42 wage earners, while the overall average is just 1.65 earners. And they also have fewer dependent children; 56% of these families have no such children, compared with 48% of all families.    And just where are most of these households located? Primarily in the suburbs of large cities. That's where two-thirds of them are. And nearly 90% own their own homes.    Of course, even fewer households -- about 1.3 million -- have after-tax income of $75,000 or more, which amounts to less than 2% of all households in the U.S.    Today's Students   Say Money Isn't Everything   WHAT DO students want most from a job? A high starting salary is important, but not all that important, according to a Roper Organization poll of more than 1,000 college students in April.    Of primary interest to these students was the opportunity for promotion, followed by job security and long-term income potential. They ranked starting salary in sixth place, right after &quot;opportunities for creativity or to exercise initiative&quot; and employee-benefits packages.    Even so, these students do think about money. According to the survey, the average student said that &quot;to get by&quot; a family would need an annual income of $30,000; to live &quot;in reasonable comfort,&quot; an income of $50,000; and to &quot;fulfill all their dreams,&quot; an income of $100,000.    In the same survey, the students also revealed where some of that money might, and might not, be spent. Nearly half said they normally don't eat breakfast, while 82% admitted to scarfing down the occasional late-night snack.    Comparing Habits   In U.S. and Canada   CANADIANS AND Americans may have some of the same bad habits, but they don't indulge in them to nearly the same degree, according to surveys conducted in 1985 by the U.S. and Canadian governments.    In some ways, the U.S. seems to be the healthier of the two countries. Take alcohol consumption. In Canada, 82% of all adults drink, while only 65% of U.S. adults do. Striking as that difference is, it's even greater among women age 18 to 24. More than 90% of young Canadian women drink. The equivalent figure for U.S. women is 64%.    People living in Canada also are less likely to have a morning meal. Only 30% of all Canadians eat breakfast every day, compared with 55% of all Americans.    Nonetheless, Canadians as a whole may be more physically fit than Americans. More than half of the Canadian population regularly participates in some kind of exercise or sports. The percentage for Americans is just 40%. And by age 65, less than one-third of Americans exercise. Meanwhile, 59% of elderly Canadians continue to work out, doing so at least three times a week for at least 15 minutes each time.    Other comparisons: Almost 80% of Canadians usually buckle up when driving; only 36% of Americans can say the same. And when it comes to smoke detectors, 77% of all Canadian adults own one; in the U.S., only 69% of all adults do. </TEXT></DOC>
