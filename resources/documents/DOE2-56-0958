The examination of the effect of removing electrons from M shellon the principal K{alpha}(K{alpha}L{sup 0}) lines indicates that themost significant is the effect of removing 3p and then 3s subshells andthat the effect of additional holes strongly increases with the atomicnumber. Detailed calculations have been performed on palladium to shedlight on the structure of the K{alpha}L/sup n/ satellite lines of itsx-ray spectrum, which is the first systematic theoretical study on thestructure of these lines of a heavy atom. It has been found that in allcases the ''average'' positions of the groups of lines correspondingto the transitions of the type 1s/sup -1/2p/sup -n/{yields}2p/sup -(n+1)/obtained in the present work are very close to the recently measuredexperimental positions of appropriate K{alpha}L/sup n/ satellite lines.On the other hand, the structure of the satellite lines has been shownto be much more complex than can be observed experimentally. The resultsof this work can be used to construct different theoretical K{alpha}L/supn/ spectra for palladium, satisfactorily reproducing the shape of variousexperimental spectra generated by different inducing projectiles.</TEXT></DOC>
