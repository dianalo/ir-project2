(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the mountains of Montana, where elkhunting puts meat on the table, gun enthusiasts acknowledgePresident Bush's proposal to limit the firepower of semiautomaticweapons won't affect their sport directly.   Still, many oppose the new legislation because, as one said, it'sa ``foot-in-the-door kind of thing.''   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association,entered the White House saying he didn't believe in restrictions onsemiautomatic weapons.   But in March, following outrage over the slaying of fiveschoolchildren in Stockton, Calif., by a man with an AK-47 rifle,Bush banned imports of assault-style firearms. Last month, he calledfor a 15-shot limit on magazine size.   Montana hunters take their weapons seriously, befitting a statewhere big game is big business: Non-resident elk licenses sell for acrisp $450 and hunters from throughout the world stalk mountain goatand bighorn sheep.   Sportsmen in Montana primarily use high-powered, bolt-actionrifles where accuracy over long distances is more important than thenumber of shots fired.   The idea of spraying a whitetail deer, an elk or a moose with 30fast shots from an assault rifle is mind-boggling to the averageMontana hunter, who hopes to have meat left to eat.   They also said the big ``banana clips'' of ammunition are heavyand cumbersome, reducing a rifle's accuracy.   ``You don't go big game hunting with 15-round clips. Most havefour or five rounds in their rifle and a spare clip in theirpocket,'' said Kalispell gun dealer B.J. Lupton. ``The sportsman isconcerned about doing things as cleanly as possible and in asportsmanlike way, so he doesn't go hunting with a 15-round clipanyway.''   The big clips ``defeat the purpose of a sporting firearm: to killcleanly with one shot,'' said Al Bishop, a Billings attorney andformer member of the Montana Fish and Game Commission.   But in a state where many believe the right to bear arms was the11th Commandment, the president's proposal still meets opposition.   ``I think we've got our issues tangled a little bit,'' Luptonsaid. ``The sportsmen in Montana are not concerned about 15-roundclips for hunting, but I think they may be concerned with aninvasion of their constitutional right to bear arms.''   Paul Berg, a retired wildlife biologist of Billings, wonders whatgood Bush's proposal will do. ``It's just a foot-in-the-door kind ofthing to take all our guns away from us in time,'' he said.   David Scott, president of the Billings Rod and Gun Club, alsoargued that the 15-round limit is merely a starting point for peoplewho would outlaw guns completely.   ``It may solve some problems to limit the clips to 15, but still,you're starting to infringe on what you can own and what you can'town,'' Scott added.   ``It's a law without a purpose, and a law that cannot beenforced,'' said Rocky Hook of Missoula. ``Its only effect would beagainst law-abiding people. If it were passed, I guarantee you you'dstill see drug dealers with banana clips coming out of their Uzis.''   Two big-clip rifles, the Ruger Mini-14 and the Colt AR-16 _ thecivilian version of the Army's M-16 _ are popular with some varminthunters precisely because they carry big clips.   Having up to 30 shots is handy for shooting fast-moving coyotes,gophers and squirrels, Hook said.   Dick Pedersen of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms hassaid his bureau is concerned about guns with ``pistol grips, whichare used predominantly for firing from the hip, bayonet lugs thatallow a bayonet to be fixed, collapsible shoulder stocks, forclose-in combat-type shooting and concealability, threaded barrelswhich could accept silencers and large-capacity magazines.''   The Bush administration is waiting for the bureau to complete astudy to determine whether the weapons are used for sports, asrequired for imports.   But the NRA contends Americans shouldn't have to prove their gunsare used for sports, because the Second Amendment guarantees theright to bear arms.   Officials such as Baltimore County (Md.) Police Chief Neil Behansee it differently, however, because of increasing crime rateinvolving assault weapons.   ``If we have to sacrifice someone's minor recreation endeavor inorder (to save lives), I think that's a sacrifice we can make inthis country,'' Behan said.</TEXT></DOC>
