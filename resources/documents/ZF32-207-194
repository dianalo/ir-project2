 Given the variety ofprotocols, applications, wiring plans and access procedures thatmay exist in a network comprised of thousands of nodes,interoperable network management is becoming a focal point ofnetwork planning.andP;  When a product conforms to a publishedstandard, it is guaranteed to work with products based on thatstandard, so that a common-denominator of performance isestablished.andP;  Among the leading de facto standards are IBM'sSystem Network Architecture, the Open Systems Interconnection andits Common Management Information Services/Protocol (CMIS/CMIP),which functions with the Transmission Control Protocol/InternetProtocol (TCP/IP).andP;  Network managers are beginning to consider thebenefits of integrating these standards into a single managementsystem.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Network ManagementStandardsInteroperabilityOpen Systems Interconnection StandardTransmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (Computer networkprotocol)Local Area NetworksIntegrated Approach.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>De facto standards help simplify network management tasksandM;When networks first started sprouting up, network management was of littleconcern.andP;  Activity over the network was essentially simple (primarilyresource sharing) and the typical network was small.andM;As networks have grown in size and complexity, however, the need for theirprofessional management has grown exponentially.andP;  While a two-node networkneeds scarcely any managing, and the isolation of faults is in most casesobvious, a network of thousands of nodes requires a sophisticated system totrack, monitor and manage its activities.andM;Contributing to the complexity of the task is the wide variety of networkwiring schemes, access methods, protocols and applications that must bebrought together.andP;  Only recently did network providers begin to realize thatit is to the benefit of their customers, as well as to themselves, to focustheir efforts on interoperable network management systems.andP;  There are twoways to achieve this: conform to a published standard or develop an opensystem.andM;A product conforming to a published standard is guaranteed to interact withother product developed to the same standard, or at least to acommon-denominator level of functionality.andP;  A product developed to conform toan open system is to a large degree doing the same thing.andP;  All the interfacesand transactions of such as system are documented and published (&quot;open&quot;) sothat others can enable their systems to interact with it.andP;  It's through thisprocess that de facto standards are created.andM;While there have been numerous attempts by different groups to developnetwork management standards and de facto standards, three major developmentsappear to be staking out the high ground for network management standards,each of which addresses the needs of a specific network area.andM;IBM Networks (also referred to as corporate networks): IBM's presence in themarket is strong enough to allow IBM to develop its own network managementsolutions.andP;  As highlighted before, IBM created NetView, a complete managementsystem focusing on System Network Architecture (SNA) networks.andP;  It became ade facto standard but allows for integration of other systems through an openarchitecture.andM;OSI networks (also referred to as enterprise networks): For several years,International Standards Organization's Open System Interconnection (OSI)standards have been promoted as the basis for interconnectivity between alldevices of all networks.andP;  Such companies as Digital, ATandamp;T and Hewlett-Packardhave announced that their network management strategies are based on the OSIcommon management information services/protocol (CMIS/CMIP) standards.andO;recent major events -- including CMIS/CMIP attaining draft internationalstandard status and the definition of how the components of CMIP work withTCP/IP -- have made OSI a viable solution for products.andM;Network workgroups (also known as PC LANS): These represent a new, growingdevelopment in networking and tend to consist of smaller computing devicessuch as personnel computers.andP;  Most workgroups probably started as a couple ofPCs sharing a printer but, with increased processing power, many haveexpanded to include thousands of PCs connected with hundreds of servers andother shared resources.andM;While the good news is that the networking world appears to be closing in ononly these network management standards -- and away from the numerousproprietary offerings of the past -- the bad news is that three is still morethan one.andM;The solution is to integrate the three standards into a single managementsystem so that all the components (i.e.andP;  each standard) can communicate andexchange essential management information.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
