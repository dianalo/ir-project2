The Air Force said the plane was presumed down.   Ground and air search teams suspended their effort Tuesday nightbecause of low visibility and the treacherous terrain, said CoastGuard Lt. Tom Saint.   ``There have been no communications with it of any sort,'' Saintsaid. ``We'll go out again at first light.''   The plane was practicing instrument landing approaches at theKodiak Airport, the Air Force said. Weather at the time of theaircraft's disappearance was six miles visibility but cloud coverwas only 1,200 feet, officials said.   Gil Nyerges, a commuter pilot with Herman-MarkAir, said he hearda jet approaching the airport.   ``And I thought, `Gee whiz, I'd hate to be over the airportmoving toward the mountains right now because of the weather.'   ``About that time, I looked up and saw a military jet ... I saidI hope this guy has enough altitude to clear Barometer Mountainbecause it sits right at the end of the runway. Then I heard a loudexplosion followed by four or five popping noises.   ``I ran inside in a big tizzy and nobody else heard it. There wasa lot of fog in the area, so I think that soaked up a lot of soundand reverberation.''   ``When I saw this fellow go overhead, he was on a course and atan altitude that would have taken him into the mountain,'' Nyergessaid.   ``There was speculation by a lot of people that what I heardwasn't an explosion but an afterburner kicking in and the secondaryexplosions were (engine) compressors not kicking in,'' he said.   The plane was based at Elmendorf Air Force Base at Anchorage,said Staff Sgt. David Haulbrook. The pilot's name was not released.   More than 30 of the single-seat jets are assigned to the 21stTactical Fighter Wing at Elmendorf.   Capt. Janice Mullan, a spokeswoman for the Alaskan Air Command,said F-15s have been involved in at least four accidents in Alaskafrom 1982 to 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
