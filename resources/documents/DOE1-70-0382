Key results from a worldwideDelphi survey are presented on the expected timing and rate of marketdevelopment for ceramic engine components and engines. These resultsshow that, by the mid 1990s, a substantial number of ceramic engine componentswill be in production and ceramic-intensive engines will be introduced.Also presented in the study are benefits and barriers to the use of ceramictechnology in heat engines and other relevant factors influencing itsrate of adoption. A modeling approach is presented that uses the surveydata to produce a series of market penetration curves for individualceramic engine components for light- and heavy-duty applications underdifferent scenarios. Finally, the conditions required for rapid marketdevelopment of ceramic technology for heat engines are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
