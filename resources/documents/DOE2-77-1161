First we carried out exact diagonalizationfor the neutron and proton systems separately, using as a basis spacethe 126 vector space of four/five pairs within nine appropriate deformedNilsson orbitals. For the pairing force we included both monopole andquadrupole terms. Next, we used the lowest eight eigenfunctions fromboth the neutron and the proton systems to generate a new basis spacecomposed of the 64 possible neutron-proton product vectors. The n-p forcewas approximated by a quadrupole-quadrupole force term which was thendiagonalized within the new basis space. The resulting wave functionswere used to calculate the neutron pair transfer strength from and tothe various low O{sup +} states below 3 MeV in the even-even Gd, Dy andEr isotopes. Furthermore, for the case where the deformation parametersdo not change appreciably between the pair of nuclides involved in thepair transfer reaction, reasonable global agreement was obtained forthe measured (t,p) and (p,t) pair transfer reaction strengths both tothe ground and excited states O{sup +} states accessible in these isotopes.The observed enhancement of (t,p) pair transfer strength to excited statesin some of these isotopes was reproduced by the calculation. The enhancementis due to subshell gap and large relative pair transfer amplitude foran orbital near the Fermi surface. 24 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
