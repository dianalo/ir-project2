Although the statistic doesnot allow for a full time coverage in all lines, it is possible to analyzeCaII H and K shifts and intensity variations, along with calibrated averageprofiles in other lines. Results are compared with other observationsand predictions of the acoustic model. (author). 5 figs., 13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
