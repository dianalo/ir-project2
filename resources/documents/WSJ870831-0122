And after months of seeing the announced candidates -- The Seven Dwarfs -- crisscross Iowa, a recent survey of 303 Democrats who had attended that state's 1984 caucuses found that 65% were still undecided.    What is wrong with the current crop of Democratic contenders? &quot;Too many Indians are running, and not enough chiefs,&quot; says Bill Stern, a former finance chairman for New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo. &quot;A lot of Democrats say these guys all sound alike and all look like they came off the relief benches.&quot; Several party officials openly express regret that Gov. Cuomo and Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Sam Nunn of Georgia aren't offering an alternative.    Moderate and conservative Democrats are especially vexed at not having a candidate of their own. Former Democratic Party Chairmen Bob Strauss and John White urged Senator Nunn to run. But after months of playing Hamlet, Senator Nunn said last Thursday he will not enter the race because of the effect it would have on his family and Senate duties.    Mr. Nunn's boosters believed that a moderate candidate could enter the race this late and even skip the much-touted Iowa caucus by labeling it as unrepresentative of party thinking. (In 1984, 42% of Iowa caucus-goers favored a unilateral freeze on nuclear-weapons deployment. Nationally, only 14% of Democrats favored such a freeze.)    Senator Nunn had a chance because a total of 14 Southern states with 55% of the delegates needed to nominate will be holding a joint primary on March 8 (&quot;Super Tuesday&quot;). A candidate clearly seen as representing the South could walk away with the lion's share of those delegates.    Mr. Nunn's departure leaves Tennessee Senator Albert Gore as the only Southern candidate. But Senator Gore is basically a liberal consultant's idea of a Southern candidate. Southerners would notice that he doesn't have an accent, votes for big spending programs and is against Contra aid.    Senator Gore and the others could be eclipsed in the South by Jesse Jackson, who won more than 20% of the vote there in the 1984 primaries. Since Mr. Jackson is on the far left of the party, that would give yet another boost to the left wing that has dominated the party for 15 years.    Mr. Nunn's career rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action was only 29% -- all of his congressional colleagues who are running have scores at least double that. He supports aid to the Contras, has voted to overturn the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision on abortion and probably will vote to confirm Judge Robert Bork's nomination.    We have some key policy differences with Senator Nunn, but his candidacy would have given Democrats a choice other than among contenders who mainly disagree about how best to appeal to liberal activists in Des Moines. Many Democrats feel disenfranchised by their party -- in 1984, 68% of Democrats who voted in the primaries called themselves moderate or conservative. Still others are just bored by the current crop of candidates. Senator Nunn, with his Southern style and calls for fiscal prudence and a bipartisan foreign policy, might have made some people stop telling pollsters Gary Hart is still their favorite candidate. </TEXT></DOC>
