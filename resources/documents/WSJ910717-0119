By that measure, there are a lot of bad guarantees outthere. And service guarantees are starting to get the samereputation as product warranties, as they force customers tofight the fine print.</LP><TEXT>   The German airline Lufthansa, for example, guarantees thatpassengers won't miss a connecting flight but excludes&quot;situations beyond Lufthansa's control.&quot; That includes badweather or air-traffic-control delays -- the two most commonreasons for a flight delay.   Many retailers guarantee customers won't find lower pricesadvertised elsewhere but then attach a string of conditions.McDuff Electronics andamp; Appliances Supercenters, a division ofTandy Corp., has a typical disclaimer: &quot;This guarantee doesnot apply to manufacturer's close-outs, rebates, specialpurchases, liquidations, limited quantity, floor demonstratoror going-out-of-business sale items.&quot;   Why do companies insist on making guarantees conditional?&quot;They think people will cheat,&quot; says Christopher Hart, aCambridge, Mass., consultant who wrote an influential 1988Harvard Law Review article on service guarantees. In fact, hesays, cheaters make up no more than 3% of the people whomight cash in a guarantee. &quot;Don't wipe out the power aguarantee can have to the 97% who don't cheat by carefullydesigning it so the other 3% can't get you,&quot; he advises.   Even some unconditional guarantees have bureaucraticrequirements that can dissuade people from cashing in. TexacoInc.'s refining and marketing unit, seeking customer feedbackon its new Star-Mart convenience stores, offers a $5 in-storecertificate to any dissatisfied customer. But first thecustomer must mail in a form that requests the name -- andphysical description -- of the employee who caused theproblem; fewer than two customers per store bothered to do soin the first year.   Fred Stanger, Star-Mart project manager, acknowledges thatthe form might be keeping people from responding. &quot;That's whywe're going to go to an 800 number, too,&quot; he says, addingthat a physical description is needed in case the offendingemployee might be wearing another's name badge.   Guarantees can also be difficult to redeem if employeesdon't understand them. In an Atlanta Pizza Hut, for instance,an employee said the restaurant wasn't giving out coupons forlate-arriving pizzas that week because it was running pizzaspecials. A Pizza Hut spokesman said, &quot;No, that's not so.&quot;   Whatever a company might be offering, it is crucial forthe company to respond promptly when a dissatisfied customerinvokes a guarantee. &quot;Customers don't want to wait,&quot; says J.Elias Portnoy, a marketing consultant who wrote a book aboutconsumer complaints. &quot;Once it's beyond the point of `Wefailed, here's your coupon,' instantly, it just createsfrustration.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Marketing: More Firms PledgeGuaranteed Service&quot; -- WSJ July 17, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
