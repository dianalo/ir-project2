Aylwin, a 70-year-old law professor, former senate president andcurrent president of the centrist Christian Democratic Party,accepted the nomination by a 17-party coalition.   He promised that if elected, he would lead a government ``for allChileans and with all Chileans.''   ``I have faith in victory at the polls, to win the government anda wide majority in congress,'' he said.   Election winners will take office on March 11, 1990.   Meanwhile, the conservative pro-government forces continueddifficult negotiations to choose their presidential candidate.Sergio Jarpa, 66, who served as Pinochet's interior minister, isconsidered the front-runner.   Most constitutional experts agree that Pinochet legally cannotsucceed himself. He was obliged to call the open election afterlosing an Oct. 5 referendum. Voters rejected a military proposal toextend his term until 1997.   The coalition promised on Thursday to restore complete democracyin Chile. It announced agreement on a joint platform for a futurecivilian government, including major social reforms to aid the poorand respect for human rights.   The Pinochet government, which has ruled since a 1973 coup, hasbeen widely accused of human rights abuses.   Thursday's nomination was attended by presidents of all theparties and nearly every senior opposition leader.   Hundreds of people, most of them young, gathered outsidecoalition headquarters in the center of the capital, waving Chileanand party flags, to follow the brief ceremony through loudpeakers.   ``Aylwin, friend, the people are with you!,'' they chanted.   Police, posted half a block away, did not interfere.   Aylwin and other leaders stressed the unity of the opposition.   ``I am, of course, aware of my limitations, but I'm sure I willbe able to overcome them with the help of you all, of the parties inthe democratic coalition, the independents, with the help of allChileans,'' Aylwin said.   He asked the parties to put differences aside, ``to buildtogether the kind of fatherland the great majority demands _progressive, free, just.''   The nomination was made by Enrique Silva, president of thecentrist Radical Party.   ``We all support you,'' Silva told Aylwin. ``You are now theleader of Chile's democratic opposition, the man who will lead us tovictory and will become the first democratic president after so manyyears of an authoritarian regime.''</TEXT></DOC>
