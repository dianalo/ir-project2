The paper reports a successful example for uses of waste woodconstruction materials and waste ties. The boiler has the capacity ofmaximum continuous steam generation of 4 ton/h and normal steam pressureof 8 kg/cm{sup 2}(maximum 10 kg/cm{sup 2}). It is combined smoke andwater tubes type with forced ventilation. It is designed with the boilerefficiency of 75%. It is capable of complete firing of any waste, i.e.,packing materials and high polymers. Its features are the automatic feedingof waste wood in irregular shapes and a cyclone for pollution control.The operation has produced favorable results since its installation atthe end of 1984. The fuel cost is less than half of heavy-oil firing,completing the facility depreciation in one year. Technical problemsand improvements such as the automation of oxygen control of ventilationunit and ash removal are also mentioned. (4 figs, 7 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
