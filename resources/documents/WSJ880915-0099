In June, July and August, the number of companies raising their dividends jumped more than 16% from a year earlier. That compares to the first five months of the year, &quot;when the trend, year to year, was just about flat,&quot; says Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard andamp; Poor's Outlook. The reason: Companies have become &quot;more confident as earnings have come in well above year-ago levels,&quot; he says, noting Sandamp;P analysts predict that earnings for the Sandamp;P 500 companies will be up 39% this year.    Strong cash positions are another factor. Corporate cash is &quot;at one of the highest levels in the last decade&quot; due to both strong corporate profits and &quot;somewhat restrained&quot; capital spending, says Carmine Grigoli, chief equity strategist of First Boston Inc. Tax law changes ending the preference for capital gains also have more companies using dividends to attract investors.    With dividends yielding 3.8% on the Sandamp;P 500, &quot;it just looks like there should be some catch-up,&quot; says Eric Miller of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc.    DENTAL MARKETING ranges from free wake-up calls to flowers.    An oversupply of dentists has the drill-and-filling set embracing a variety of techniques to attract new patients. Marvin Mansky, New York, offers wake-up calls and cleans patients teeth for free before their weddings. In Philadelphia, All About Teeth, gives portable TVs and discounts to those who recruit new patients. Harry Cohen, San Francisco, advertises in coupon books along with local pizza parlors and muffler shops. Kenneth Loeffler, Lancaster, Pa., sends flowers to patients &quot;after a particularly long or difficult procedure.&quot;    Marketing is the most popular seminar the American Dental Association offers, but the average dentist spends only $1,100 a year on advertising. The ADA says that's because most dentists have adopted low-key internal marketing. Still, many dentists reject marketing entirely. &quot;It cheapens the profession,&quot; says Donald Carmona, head of the East Coast District Dental Society, Miami. &quot;I don't do any internal marketing except to be nice to people.&quot;    HEATING SEASON arrives with few price increases on the horizon.    The decline in crude oil prices will mean lower heating-oil prices, suppliers say. Over the past year, Amoco Corp. has cut its price in the Chicago area 10 cents a gallon to 44.7 cents. At Woolley Fuel Co., Maplewood, N.J., prices are down to 82 cents, a nickel below last year; Norm Woolley says they could fall a nickel more before heating season ends. But retail prices &quot;aren't as low as they could be,&quot; says Susan Brace of Boston Oil Consumers Alliance, noting dealers cut prices slowly for fear they may have to raise them later.    Natural gas prices, already at a five-year low in Chicago, may go up slightly. But Peoples Energy Corp. says pressure from Canadian natural gas suppliers trying to break into the U.S. market will keep any increase small. Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Co., Newark, N.J., expects a 4% rise in home gas-heating costs this year, saying supply and demand are coming into balance.    Berkshire Gas Co., Pittsfield, Mass., says the end of the Iran-Iraq war could cut oil prices more, making it difficult to compete with fuel oil next year.    &quot;YOU'RE DESPICABLE&quot; say the Daffy Duck pins sent out to promote the new Warner Bros. cartoon, &quot;Night of the Living Duck.&quot; But fearing some may take offense, the studio includes a letter explaining they mean &quot;nothing personal.&quot;    THE U.S. MEDAL COUNT at the Olympics will be used to peg interest rates on a new certificate of deposit at Home Federal Bank for Savings, Waukegan, Ill. But one Chicago radio station won't advertise the CD, saying it's really a lottery.    A TAX TEXTBOOK that you can't put down -- that's the idea behind &quot;The Ultimate Rip-Off: A Taxing Tale&quot; written by accounting professor Larry Crumbley of Texas Aandamp;M University. The plot: a corrupt IRS commissioner conspires to steal $758 million in income tax revenue.    OLYMPIC COMMEMORATIVES seek buyers in a lackluster coin market.    Three different coin sets -- from South Korea, the U.S. and the Marshall Islands -- have been issued to mark the Summer Olympics. But sales come at a time when &quot;commemorative coins in general are kind of slow,&quot; says Luis Vigdor of MTB Banking Corp., New York. Reasons include inflation uncertainty, the debut of new bullion coins and lack of direction in metals markets. Moreover, many collectors are still smarting from the U.S. Constitution coins, now trading well below initial prices.    The Korean coins, with limited mintage, are being pitched to investors with some success. The first issue of the one-ounce gold coin has already sold out. The U.S. Mint sells its coins as collectibles, not investments. It has sold 291,000 gold coins and 1.1 million silver coins, about a third of its goal. Success of the Marshall Island coins, featuring diver Greg Louganis, will depend on whether he wins a gold medal.    &quot;If he does, sales will run right through next year,&quot; says Bruce Kaplan of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., Santa Monica, Calif.    BRIEFS: The economic impact of last year's outbreak of mumps at three Chicago futures exchanges was $121,000, reports Medical Week. . . . The biggest diamond ever auctioned -- a 407.48-carat gem -- goes on the block at Christie's Oct. 19. </TEXT></DOC>
