In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theBush administration was ``generally supportive'' of the accordsigned Monday by five Central American presidents. He said,however, there was skepticism that Nicaragua's Sandinistagovernment will carry out the democratic reforms it has promised.   ``The Central American presidents must fulfill the accord signedin Tela, Honduras, but the U.S. government also should not hamperthese treaties, contributing to peace in the region,'' Fitzwatersaid.   The accord calls for disbanding and resettling the rebels, knownas Contras, by the first week of December. It also urges that theU.S.-backed government of El Salvador and the leftist guerrillasresume peace negotiations.   On Thursday, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega publicly orderedthe Nicaraguan army to extend ``all guarantees of personal safety''to any Contras who want to return home.   Ortega _ President Daniel Ortega's brother _ said in acommunique that he ordered the action after learning that Col.Enrique Bermudez and other top Contra military leaders living inMiami applied for asylum in the United States.   About 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents live in squalid campsin southern Honduras, near the Nicaraguan border. For the pastyear, they have received only non-lethal aid from the United Statessuch as boots and foodstuffs.   President Ortega has promised to hold free and fair nationalelections on Feb. 25. He also got Nicaragua's 20 oppositionpolitical parties to back the peace plan.   A spokesman for Protestant denominations in Nicaragua said,``all U.S. churches could use the accord as a weapon to demand thattheir government should not interfere in the region's affairs.''   The Rev. Miguel Angelo Caso, an evangelist, called the Telaaccord ``a painful and bloody birth, in which a spark of life ispresent.''   In San Jose, Costa Rica, President Oscar Arias received amessage from Mikhail Gorbachev in which the Soviet president saidMoscow would send no more arms to Nicaragua.   In a message transmitted Thursday to Arias by Alexander Mokanuu,vice president of the Soviet Parliament, Gorbachev told reportershe supports the Central American peace plan.   Both the Soviet Union and Cuba have supplied the Sandinistaswith weapons and military assistance for the past eight years.   In San Salvador, members of a commission promoting peace talksbetween the rightist government and Marxist-led guerrillas saidThursday they found good will and determination on both sides tosolve the 9-year-old war.   A Salvadoran rebel spokeswoman told a Honduran radio station theguerrilla army ``is willing to lay down its weapons in order toachieve a lasting peace in El Salvador.''   The commission comprises the three main opposition politicalparties.   Four rounds of negotiations between 1984 and 1987 failed toproduce a breakthrough toward ending El Salvador's civil war, inwhich an estimated 70,000 people have died.</TEXT></DOC>
