<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0661 </DOCNO><TEXT>Aerojet Energy Conversion Company has developed a Ceramic Tubular DistributorPlate (CTDP) for waste heat recovery fluid bed heat exchangers (FBHX).Fluid bed waste heat recovery system (FBWHRS) performance is greatlyimproved by avoiding air dilution for inlet gas temperature reduction.A CTDP and special refractory inlet plenum make it practical to introduceundiluted 2500{degree}F flue gas directly into the FBWHRS. The configurationof the CTDP was actually an assembly of 0.406 inch diameter solid rodsof 99+% alumina with 0.010 inch nominal spacing to form the orifice--slots.The engineering design, lab scale development, bench scale cold flowdevelopment, and cold flow testing preceded successful combustion gastesting with No. 2 Fuel Oil. Extensive testing progressed through twospecial CTDP buildups with excellent heat transfer and pressure lossdata obtained at 1100{degree}, 1600{degree}, 1900{degree}, 2200{degree},and 2500{degree}F. Structural limitations in the distributor plate configurationwere identified and apparently resolved, although final validation ofthe durability of the design has not yet been completed. Si{sub 3}N{sub4} hot gas lance for cleaning and fouling prevention was readied forcombustion development testing. An economic (Simple Payback) analysisbased on projected costs of CTDP manufacturing in production quantitieswas completed. The simple payback for the CTDP system is projected tobe a 22% improvement over a FBHX with a conventional metallic distributorplate. The economic analysis was applied on aluminum remelt furnaces.</TEXT></DOC>
