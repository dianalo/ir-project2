The move was an effort to protect U.S. consumers who eatimported foods from the so-called circle of poison. Aloophole in current law allows U.S. agrichemical companies toexport pesticides even if they aren't registered for farm useor aren't tolerated on foods in this country. Illegalresidues of these pesticides, including some suspectedcarcinogens, often are found in imported fruits andvegetables as well as some beef and dairy products.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If the Environmental Protection Agency says a pesticideis too unsafe to be used on American-grown food, then it istoo unsafe to be used on foreign-grown food,&quot; asserted Sen.Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the committee chairman.   The panel adopted the legislation, part of the 1990 farmbill, by voice vote despite the objections of the NationalAgricultural Chemicals Association, a trade group comprisingpesticide manufacturers whose export sales totaled $2.2billion last year. The group warned that the bill, amongother things, could impede trade in agricultural products andforce companies to move plants overseas, eliminating jobs inthe U.S.   The Senate committee's vote was expected to spur Houseaction on an identical measure sponsored by Reps. LeonPanetta (D., Calif.), Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and Mike Synar(D., Okla.). Rep. Synar already has held hearings on thecircle-of-poison issue.   The U.S. imports 33 billion pounds of fruits andvegetables a year, roughly one-quarter of its totalconsumption. The Food and Drug Administration inspects only atiny fraction of the imports, but government inspectors havefound about 5% to be tainted with pesticides. Recent FDAsampling showed 10% of imported peas and 8% of imported pearscontained illegal residues, while U.S.-grown peas and pearscontained none.   Besides barring exports of unsafe pesticides, the Senatelegislation would prohibit imports of any food tainted withpesticides that are banned in the U.S. It also would revokeresidue tolerances that remain on the books for suchpesticides. This provision would put U.S. farmers on the samecompetitive footing as foreign growers, who currently can usecertain effective pesticides that aren't registered for useon U.S. farms.   &quot;The point of this legislation is to eliminate the doublestandard in pesticide policy,&quot; said William McNichol, adirector of a consumer group fighting what it considerspesticide misuse. The bill, if enacted, would be firstsubstantial change in pesticide law since 1978.   Among other things, the bill would require U.S.manufacturers to obtain prior consent from foreign countriesbefore shipping potentially hazardous pesticides across theirborders. And it would require safety instructions onpesticide labels to be written in the language of theimporting country.   To help the FDA screen imports, the measure would requireU.S. importers to list the pesticides generally used onimported foods. The bill has 25 co-sponsors in the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
