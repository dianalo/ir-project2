Gold prices moved higher. Republic National Bank of New Yorkquoted a late bid of $390.70 for a troy ounce of gold, up from$386.40 late Wednesday.   Analysts said the dollar declined as traders became convinced theBush administration had no firm plan to deal with the budget andtrade gaps.   Interest rates have continued to edge higher, which shouldsupport the dollar, ``but we still have twin deficits and noresolution on that,'' said Dan Holland, an analyst at Discount Corp.   Holland said traders also were concerned that the Federal Reservemight be cautious in raising interest rates so as not to burden thestruggling savings and loan industry.   Traders see Washington as placing a relatively low priority onsupporting the dollar, said Holland, who predicted the U.S. currencycould return to the levels where it traded before the Novemberelection.   Overseas dealers said the dollar was driven lower by skepticismthat U.S. interest rates will rise, and by the West German mark'sstrength. The mark, in turn, was helped by continuing speculationthat a hike in official West German interest rates would materializesoon.   After the close of trading in New York, two major banks announcedthey were raising their prime lending rate half a percentage pointto 11.5 percent, the second increase in two weeks. However, primerate hikes tend to follow, and not portend, increases in otherinterest rates.   The dollar began its day in Tokyo, falling 0.33 Japanese yen to aclosing 126.29 yen.
