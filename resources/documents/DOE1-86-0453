In siliconmonocrystals irradiated by fast electrons a microcontour following thecrystallization front, invisible in nonirradiated crystals, is foundby the selective etching technique. Besides, in dislocation-free crystals,being irradiated, the changes in the form of etching pits caused by thepresence of A defects in the tested material are observed. The microcontourtestifies to a nonuniform distribution of radiation defects and the changesin the form of etching pits is, obviously, the result of interactionof initial radiation defects with the growth microdefects.</TEXT></DOC>
