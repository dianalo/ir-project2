On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed 3cents higher at $18.59 after trading as high as $18.93 during thesession. All other contract months fell.   Refined product prices fell sharply. The March contract forheating oil dropped 0.98 cent to settle at 48.92 cents a gallon,after trading at a session high of 50.35 cents.   Unleaded gasoline scheduled for March delivery fell 0.94 cent toa closing price of 48.35 cents a gallon. Other contract months alsoclosed down.   Crude prices opened higher with buyers caught up in last-daytrading on the March contract, analysts said. Prices fluctuatedthroughout the session on various OPEC-related rumors, they said.   Late in the day, a group of producers who don't belong to theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in London,released a statement saying some producers had agreed to either cutor freeze exports during the second quarter of 1989 to helpstabilize world prices.   However, the group said it would not disclose details of theagreement until next week, which created uncertainty and pressuredprices, analysts said. ``It's disappointing because investors wereexpecting concrete numbers,'' said Nauman Barakat, vice president ofenergy investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``As long asthey don't know it's difficult to say what the bottom line is ... sothe market sold off.''   Analysts have predicted that any cutbacks by non-OPEC nationswill be minimal and probably will not alter the currentsupply-demand balance. Since OPEC reduced its production by 3million barrels daily at the start of the year, prices have risennearly $5 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
