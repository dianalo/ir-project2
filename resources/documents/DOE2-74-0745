The main concern is due to observed increasesin the atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O, halocarbons, troposphericO3 and some other gases. These gases absorb infrared radiation that leavesthe earth's surface thereby nontributing to a warmer climate (the ''greenhouseeffect''). Climate models suggest that the global mean surface temperatureshould have increased by 0.5 - 1.0 deg. C due to the presently experiencedincrease in greenhouse gases. The observed temperature increase duringthe last 100 years is reasonably consistent with such calculation. Towardsthe middle of the next century the temperature is estimated to increaseby 1.5 - 4.5 deg. C. Such a temperature increase, if realized, wouldmake the earth's surface warmer than it has been for at least 5000 years.Although it is not possible to make any detailed prediction about thefuture climate in specific regions of the globe, the changes in temperatureand rainfall are likely to have a very significant impact on agricultureand forestry, in some areas beneficial, in most others adverse. If elevatedtemperatures are sustained for several decades it is probable that thesea level would rise, eventually creating severe problems in many lowcoastal areas. The policy implications of the climate problem are brieflydiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
