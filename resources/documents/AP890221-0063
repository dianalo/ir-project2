(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Starting today Santa Monica residentscan fire off a complaint to City Hall, look for a job or check tosee if the latest best seller is at the library, all by tapping afew computer keys.   Touting itself as the city of the future, Santa Monica was to goon line with a computer system that will allow residents withpersonal computers a direct hook-up with City Hall.   Officials say they will answer each computerized missive with areply sent to that person's own computer.   But residents can use the system to do more than complain aboutmunicipal problems. They can comb the computer network to find outsuch things as where to get parking permits and dog licenses, whatevents are scheduled at the pier and the Santa Monica CivicAuditorium, which city agencies are hiring, and whether or not thebooks they want to pick up at the local library have already beenchecked out.   Eventually, the system will be used to apply for licenses andpermits, said Assistant City Manager Lynne C. Barrette.   The idea is the brainchild of community activist Michael Hill.   ``This is a marvelous way to access the (city) staff reports,''said Hill, who suggested the computer network two years ago. ``Youcan play a truly effective role. People who feel disenfranchised canfind a way to be a part of government.''   Not all reaction to the system has been positive, however.   Some officials fear the computer system will give this seasidecommunity an an image as an elitist city catering to affluentpersonal computer owners. They hope to overcome that by setting upcomputer terminals at the library and other public centers to giveeveryone access.   Computer experts expressed concern that neither the public norbureaucrats may be ready for such an innovation.   ``It may overburden ambivalent department heads and cityemployees who want to be responsive but aren't getting additionalresources,'' said Judith Payne, a social scientist at Santa Monica'sRand. Corp. think tank.   The cost of setting up the system has been nil, however. The$350,000 system, called Public Electronic Network, was a gift fromtwo computer companies. Hewlett Packard provided the hardware andMetasystems Inc. donated the software programs.   The system is designed to work with any model personal computer.There is no charge to use the network, although frequent users willsee their phone bills increasing, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
