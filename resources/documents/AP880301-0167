After Air Force One touched down on the tarmac at BrusselsZavantem Airport in windy conditions, Reagan was reunited withSecretary of State George Shultz, who had arrived from London, andmet briefly with Belgian officials.   In a gesture of reassurance given in a departure statementTuesday morning at the White House, Reagan pledged that Americantroops will remain in Europe ``so long as Europeans want them tostay.''   He also promised to protect NATO's interests in any arms dealswith the Soviet Union. ``We will never sacrifice the interests ofthis partnership in any agreement with the Soviet Union,'' he said.   After stepping down the ramp from his Boeing 707 jetliner,Reagan smiled and chatted amiably as he was greeted by Shultz, whohad just arrived from a talks Jordan's King Hussein. Also on handwere Belgium's prime minister, Wilfried Martens, and ForeignMinister Leo Tindemans.   Posing for pictures at the airport, Reagan said he was stilltroubled by congestion and cold-like symptons that had bothered himin Washington. ``The allergies are still bothering me,'' Reagansaid, adding in an aside to Shultz that his ears were stopped upafter the long flight. Reagan coughed loudly as reporters wereushered from the room.   Following a five-minute courtesy get-together with Tindemans inan airport salon, Reagan was ferried by motorcade for an overnightstay at Chateau Stuyvenberg, a 1840 brick and stone palace one usedas the favored residence of the Belgian royal family.   His motorcade _ extending nearly 20 cars _ included the nowstandard anti-sniper team and Reagan's armored limousine and abackup flown in from Washington, complete with District of Columbialicense plates.   The two-day meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels, beginningWednesday, brings together the heads of state or government of the16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The conference setsthe stage for Reagan's expected summit in Moscow with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev in late May or early June.   With the NATO headquarters site under unusually tight security,Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was the first to arrive. Therepresentatives of 14 other countries were scheduled to arriveWednesday.   In his departure statement, Reagan hailed the newly signedtreaty to abolish U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclearmissiles (INF), but said, ``the purpose of this summit is notself-congratulations.''   ``Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthypartnership between North America and Europe, for this is thefoundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially depends,'' hesaid.   Reagan said the United States will continue to press for a 50percent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons and a global ban onchemical weapons.   Beyond that, he said the NATO leaders will try ``to givenegotiations on conventional forces a new start, as well.''   ``If our common approach to the East over the years has givencoherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has beenour unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given itcredibility,'' Reagan said.   ``Arms reduction can only succeed if it is backed up by a strongdefense,'' he added. ``My Atlantic colleagues and I will rededicateourselves to maintaining the deterrent that has protected ourfreedom and prosperity for almost 40 years.''   The NATO session opens Wednesday with remarks by Britain's LordCarrington, the NATO secretary general, followed by two restrictedworking sessions, a luncheon and dinner.   Another restricted working session is planned Thursday, followedby closing remarks by Carrington and Reagan, and a news conferenceby Shultz, who broke off his shuttle diplomacy in the Middle Eastto join the president in Brussels.   Besides the United States, the members of the alliance areCanada, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Denmark,Greece, Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Turkey andThe Netherlands.   Alton G. Keel, the U.S. NATO ambassador, said on the eve of thesummit that he thought the leaders would likely declare that NATOplaces a high priority on negotiating conventional arms stabilityin Europe.   Alliance sources, declining to be identified publicly, have saidthat such a declaration may be in addition to an overall statementwhich will boil down to a renewed pledge of confidence in NATOpolicies and goals.   It is hoped the new conventional talks can begin in earnest inthe fall in Vienna.   ``There's a general consensus now'' on key elements of NATO'snegotiating position, namely, that cuts should be ``assymetric'' inview of the Warsaw Pact's large numerical advantage in conventionalfirepower, according to Keel.   The summit is designed to be a public display of alliancesolidarity despite peace and disarmament gestures from the SovietUnion.   It also is intended to reassure Europeans that the INF agreementwill not leave them vulnerable to superior numbers of Warsaw Pacttanks and artillery.   The budget crunch in the United States has triggered some fearsin NATO about a possible reduction in the 326,000 American troopsstationed in Western Europe.   Planners on both sides of the Atlantic said the leaders plannedto play down disagreements, such as the updating of NATO'sshort-range nuclear arms, most of which are deployed by the UnitedStates in West Germany, and disputes over basing U.S. forces inEurope.   Despite the U.S. role as the leader and paymaster of NATO,Reagan will play a low-key role in public at the two-day meeting,delivering only a brief summary statement at the close on Thursday.   In all, the schedule called for Reagan to be away fromWashington only 57 and one-half hours, including 15 hours and 15minutes on Air Force One flying to and from Brussels.   He will return Thursday evening, in plenty of time to celebratehis 36th wedding annivesary Friday with his wife, Nancy.   Reagan's themes for the meeting were carefully sketched out inadvance in a series of public remarks, including an addressbroadcast to Europe last week and a speech on Monday to an AmericanLegion convention.   He warned that the West must remain vigilant about the SovietUnion and be skeptical about its intentions. Reagan also said NATOmust keep nuclear forces in place and up to date.   The president said the Warsaw Pact's numerical superiority innon-nuclear forces _ the so-called conventional forces _ must beaddressed with the same urgency as the problem of strategic nuclearweapons.   And he suggested that NATO members should pay a greater share ofthe alliance's defense burden.   Testifying to the House Budget Committee Tuesday, DefenseSecretary Frank Carlucci said America's NATO allies should spendmore money for defense. But he also said that congressionaldenunciation of alliance partners is not the best way to get thatdone.   ``I quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to domore,'' Carlucci said. But he added that ``I don't think it is veryuseful to simply berate the Europeans on this.''</TEXT></DOC>
