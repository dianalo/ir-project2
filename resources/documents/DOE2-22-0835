Implementation of any or all parts of a strategic defensesystem would constitute a shift away from the offense-dominant strategythat the U.S. has espoused for over forty years. Effecting a shift inU.S. nuclear strategy while maintaining stability between the superpowersis an extremely difficult task. Opponents of SDI have raised the questionof whether we should pursue SDI and the ensuing shift in strategy atall.
