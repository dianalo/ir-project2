It involves the construction of a hydroelectric facility thatwill store water at the base of Rocky Mountain in 3 reservoirs totaling1,200 acres to be created by impounding Heath Creek. A 221-acre reservoirwill be constructed at the top of Rocky Mountain. During off-peak hours,water from the lower reservoir will be pumped to the upper reservoir througha system of penstocks, a horizontal tunnel and a vertical shaft in RockyMountain. During peak hours when additional generating capacity is needed,the water in the upper reservoir will be released through Rocky Mountainto a powerhouse and back into the lower reservoir. The Project also includes2.7 miles of 230 KV transmission line and a switching station. GeorgiaPower Company (GPC) started construction on the Project in 1978 and estimatesthat it is 15 percent complete today. Extensive clearing of the site hasalready taken place. Alternatives to OPC's involvement in the Project includeno action, load management/conservation, construction of generating resources,and the purchase of power. A more detailed description of the Project isprovided in the Information Supplement. The FEIS for the Project was issued by the Federal Power Commission inMay 1976 in connection with the licensing of the Project to GPC. FERC issuedthe Final Supplement to the FEIS in June 1981, in connection with the relocationof the lower reservoir dam, construction of two smaller dams and a permanentdiversion channel. On January 28, 1988, FERC issued an order transferringthe license to construct, maintain, and operate the project from GPC toOPC and GPC subject to the filing at FERC of the instruments evidencingthe transfer of the Project. OPC and GPC propose to own the Project astenants in common. OPC will be acquiring a majority interest in the Projectand assume the responsibility for completion and operation of the Projectsubject to obtaining requisite approvals. REA has reviewed the FEIS and the Final Supplement to the FEIS and hasindependently determined that these documents together meet the standardsfor an adequate environmental impact statement. In addition, REA has reviewedother documents including an environmental report submitted by OPC, thearticles contained in the FERC license for the project related to mitigatingenvironmental impacts, and amendments to the FERC license. REA has independentlydetermined that there are no substantial changes in the Project and nosignificant new circumstances or information relevant to environmentalconcerns related to its Federal action of approving OPC's participationin the Project. Pursuant to 40 CFR 1506.3 of the CEQ regulations and 7CFR 1794.81(b) of REA's Environmental Policies and Procedures, REA is adoptingthe FEIS and the Final Supplement to the FEIS as its Final EnvironmentalImpact Statement for its Federal action. In accordance with 7 CFR 1794.90(c),REA has determined the purposes of NEPA will be furthered by preparingan Information Supplement. REA will circulate a copy of its InformationSupplement, the FEIS and the Final Supplement to the FEIS to interestedparties or agencies with specific expertise related to the project includingthose receiving the Federal Power Commission's Draft EIS and FERC's DraftSupplement to the EIS for the Project. Copies of the Information Supplement,the FEIS and Final Supplement to the FEIS will be made available to thepublic and other interested parties. The Information Supplement provides a description of the Project and theextent to which it has been completed by GPC, describes how it differsfrom the proposed facilities as described in the FERC FEIS, and discussesOPC's need for the Project and the alternatives to the proposed action.The Information Supplement also discusses the information considered byREA in adopting the FERC FEIS and Final Supplement to the FEIS as REA'sFinal Environmental Impact Statement for its Federal action related tothe Project. Also covered briefly are the environmental impacts of theProject identified in the FEIS and Supplement to the FEIS, recent commentsreceived from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and a review of articlesin the FERC license for the Project that are related to the protectionof environmental quality. Copies of the REA's Information Supplement, the FEIS and the Final Supplementto the FEIS may be examined or obtained from REA or OPC during regularbusiness hours at the addresses provided in this notice. These three documentsare being sent to the Sara Hightower Regional Library, 606 West First Street,Rome, Georgia 30161 (telephone (404) 291-7568) and the Cave Spring PublicLibrary, P.O. Box 339, Cave Spring, Georgia 30124 (telephone (404) 777-3346)so they will be available for public review. Both libraries are in thevicinity of the project area. OPC will have published in the <T3>Cartersville Herald Tribune</T3> and the <T3>Rome News Tribune</T3> a notice containing the same information providedherein. A paid advertisement referring the reader to the notice will beincluded in each newspaper. Questions or comments concerning REA's actionrelated to this project should be submitted within 30 days to REA at theaddress provided in this notice. The 30-day period will begin on the dateof this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice or the date of a legal notice and paidadvertisement published for OPC, whichever comes later. REA will take nofinal action related to the project prior to the expiration of this commentperiod. REA, at the time it makes its decision regarding the Project, shallprepare a public Record of Decision (ROD). Any person, organization orgovernment body which desires to be notified when a ROD is available shouldcontact REA at the address provided herein.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: August 3, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jack Van Mark, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Deputy Administrator, Program Operations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-17983 Filed 8-8-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-15-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
