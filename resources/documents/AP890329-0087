WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today said127 people have been charged in investigation he said smashed abillion-dollar international money-laundering ring with links tothe Medellin drug cartel of Colombia.   Thornburgh called it ``the largest money-laundering crackdownever carried out by the federal government.''   Authorities seized a half-ton of cocaine and $45 million incash, jewelry and real estate, and have identified more assets forpotential seizure, he said.   ``There is no more effective way to deal with the business ofdrug trafficking than to take the profit out of it. That's what hashappened with Operation Polar Cap,'' Thornburgh said at a newsconference.   Federal authorities also obtained conspiracy indictments againsttwo South American banks, Banco de Occidente of Panama and Banco deOccidente of Colombia, on charges they were involved in launderingmore than $1 billion in drug proceeds generated in the UnitedStates.   Appearing with Thornburgh was FBI Director William Sessions,Drug Enforcement Administrator John Lawn and other federalauthorities. Lawn said the sophisticated and complicatedmoney-laundering operation laundered $1.2 billion in two years.   Thornburgh called it ``a very hostile takeover of a majormoney-laundering operation.''   Lawn said federal investigators in Atlanta were told bydrug-world leaders that the money-laundering scheme they wereoperating undercover was processing the money too slowly anddescribed a faster Los Angeles-based operation that could laundertheir money in 48 hours.   He said it was called ``La Mina,'' or ``The Mine,'' and thatauthorities began investigating that operation. He said it involvedtransfers of drug-proceeds and laundered money through severalcities and Panama, Colombia and Uruguay.   The Justice Department said that among the indictments resultingfrom the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealedtoday in Atlanta and eight people arrested Tuesday evening in NewYork.   Bruce Pagel, an attorney in the department's narcotics section,said most of the 127 people charged in the investigation had beenarrested but that authorities were still pursuing some.   The department said the Atlanta indictment traces theestablishment of the money-laundering enterprise directly toleaders of the Colombian Medellin cartel, which authorities say isthe source of 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in this country.   Federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in Atlanta, Miami,New York and San Francisco, and additional arrests were expected inNew York, Los Angeles and Miami, the department said.   Thornburgh said there was no evidence of illegal activity byU.S. banks, and that the banks cooperated in the investigation.   Lawn said authorities also hoped to make an arrest today inPanama with the help of the Panamanian Defense Forces. Thornburghsaid federal authorities continued to cooperate with the force,despite the pending federal drug indictment against Panamanianleader Manuel Noriega.</TEXT></DOC>
