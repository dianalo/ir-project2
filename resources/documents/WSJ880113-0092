While details haven't been worked out, it appeared the proposal could satisfy U.S. demands and avert a threatened U.S. ban on participation by Japanese companies in public-works projects in this country. In December, Congress passed legislation that would impose such a ban on countries that don't open their markets to U.S. concerns.    &quot;We're still negotiating, but we think it will meet what we want for opening the Japanese market to U.S. bidders,&quot; a senior Reagan administration official said.    Mr. Takeshita's proposal calls for U.S. construction concerns to enter into joint ventures with Japanese companies in bidding on public-works projects in Japan. Besides initially giving the U.S. concerns a better chance of winning contracts, that would help them gain experience in the Japanese bidding process so they later would be better able to qualify on their own for some of Japan's large publicly financed projects, U.S. trade officials said.    The U.S. concerns, the officials added, will be assured of &quot;preferential treatment&quot; over other foreign companies in forming such partnerships.    Japanese officials said as many as &quot;six or seven&quot; large Japanese public-works projects could be open to U.S. companies under these arrangements. Although Japanese officials didn't specify which projects would be covered, they could include the proposed new Tokyo Bay airport and a bridge to span Japan's Inland Sea. Japan could spend as much as $60 billion to $70 billion on such construction in the next 10 years.    In an earlier concession to the U.S. last fall, then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone offered U.S. concerns some short cuts to bidding for the Kansai airport project in western Honshu and the Tokyo Bay bridge project, both of which are publicly financed but run by private companies. But Mr. Takeshita's offer expands on his predecessor's by addressing the tougher barriers keeping foreign companies out of projects actually managed by Japanese government agencies.    Mr. Takeshita, who is scheduled to meet with President Reagan today, left the details of his plan to be worked out by other officials. But after Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary of State George Shultz discussed the issue yesterday, U.S. officials appeared hopeful that they could reach an agreement in &quot;two days,&quot; before Mr. Takeshita leaves Washington.    Sources close to the Japanese delegation said an implicit condition for such a settlement is a U.S. commitment to exempt Japanese construction concerns from a law banning companies from countries with closed markets from participating in federally funded U.S. public-works projects. The ban would take effect for Japan later this month, but the statute allows President Reagan to waive it if doing so would be in the &quot;national interest.&quot;    The U.S. construction industry reacted with some skepticism to early reports about Mr. Takeshita's proposal. &quot;These are nothing but procedural reforms,&quot; asserted Mark Chalpin, a spokesman for the International Engineering and Construction Council. &quot;What we should be looking for are market results.&quot; The council, which is based in Washington, represents numerous general-contracting, engineering and architectural companies.    A spokesman for the Japan Federation of Construction Companies said many of its members have been urging a quick settlement. The threatened U.S. ban would affect only a small proportion of their annual U.S. business of $2 billion or more, but it could create an &quot;image problem&quot; that eventually could hurt their larger, private-sector business in the U.S., the spokesman explained.    But other Japanese contractors say Mr. Takeshita may have difficulty selling the plan to some of his own constituents. While large Japanese concerns with U.S. business prospects appear to be supporting the plan, smaller companies with little interest in overseas ventures want to keep the domestic market shut to foreign competition.    Some U.S. companies are taking the joint-venture offer seriously. Westinghouse Electric Corp., for instance, which already has indicated that it could link up with a Japanese partner to supply the Kansai airport with radar equipment and people-moving equipment, is interested in a similar venture involving the new Tokyo airport. Caterpillar Inc. has expressed a similar interest.    Acquiring a Japanese track record through a joint venture would allow U.S. concerns to escape a &quot;Catch-22&quot; in current Japanese procedures for bidding for public-works contracts, U.S. officials said. The rules allow only companies with &quot;experience&quot; in such contracts to bid. But U.S. concerns can't obtain the required experience unless they are allowed to win some of those awards.    Under certain circumstances, however, the proposal would allow U.S. companies' work outside Japan to be counted in qualifying for bids on Japanese projects.    During his visit, Mr. Takeshita also may settle a U.S. complaint about Japanese import quotas on 10 categories of farm products and foodstuffs in contravention of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules. As previously reported, the Japanese have offered to remove quotas on eight of the categories and to compensate the U.S. for those on the other two. A senior U.S. official said the &quot;matter is pretty well taken care of.&quot;    The visiting premier also is expected to announce an arrangement through which U.S. scientists could expand their contacts with Japanese research facilities. Earlier, White House officials complained that the lack of U.S. access to Japanese scientific projects has an adverse impact on U.S. trade. </TEXT></DOC>
