They said the U.S. command's lack offlexibility was a major factor in the failure of the overthrow.   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., told theSenate he had just received information that the officer identifiedas the leader of the coup, Maj. Moises Giroldi, had been executedand that ``Noriega personally shot'' the rebel leader.   Helms said he based his account on information collected by hisstaff from unspecified sources.   An administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the government ``believes Giroldi is dead'' but does not haveconfirmation.   Helms also alleged that while the rebels had Noriega in custodythey asked U.S. authorities to take custody of him and remove himto the United States.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney denounced Helms' claim as``hogwash.''   According to U.S. officials who declined to be identified,forces loyal to Noriega surprised the rebels and the U.S. militaryby flying in a company of troops to an air strip near the militaryheadquarters, which the insurgents had seized Tuesday morning.   Shortly after the pro-Noriega forces moved in on theheadquarters, a key battalion that had not declared itself threwits support to the Panamanian leader, the U.S. officials said.   According to the officials, the U.S. Southern Command could haveprevented the takeoff of the aircraft carrying the pro-Noriegaforces by filling the sky over the airbase with American aircraft.   But the command did not have the discretionary authority to takethat action and did not get the required approval from Washington,the officials said.   During an appearance on Capitol Hill, Cheney was asked aboutHelms' claim that U.S. officials turned down an offer to takecustody of Noriega.   ``Any charge that we were somehow offered Noriega and didn'ttake him is hogwash,'' the secretary replied.   Cheney said in an interview with CBS earlier today that rebelshad refused in a ``face-to-face contact'' with a U.S. militaryofficer to turn over Noriega during the coup attempt.   The administration has insisted the rebels were not interestedin turning Noriega over to the United States, but wanted him simplyto retire and remain in Panama.   Cheney said that at one point during the uprising ``shortlybefore the coup collapsed, contact between one of our militaryofficers and two junior officers that were involved in the coup''occurred at Fort Clayton, a U.S. facility in Panama.   Asked about the meeting, Cheney said, ``It was a face-to-facecontact. ... And that was where they made it clear to us that theywould not turn Noriega over to us.'' He did not name theindividuals involved.   President Bush has come under sharp criticism from someRepublicans as well as Democrats in Congress for not intervening onthe side of the coup leaders. The critics claim he missed aprecious opportunity to oust Noriega, who faces drug charges inthis country.   ``They wanted certainty,'' Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said of theadministration. ``You do not get an engraved invitation to a coup.They just lacked boldness.''   But Cheney, a former House member, brushed aside congressionalcriticism as ``Monday morning advice.''   ``The same people who'd be criticizing us if we had intervenedare now criticizing us for not intervening,'' he said.   Cheney's comments were part of a campaign by the administrationto defend Bush's actions on Tuesday. The defense secretary was ontwo morning talk shows after granting an interview to CBS forbroadcast on Wednesday night and talking with reporters on CapitolHill on Wednesday.   ``This is an issue where it's open to disagreement but I thinkon the whole we found the support to be very strong and very broad,actually,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today. ``Tohave a handful of congressmen suggest it was the wrong course is apretty minor response.''   At the same time, the administration was moving to underscoreits continued opposition to Noriega.   Vice President Dan Quayle met today with Guillermo Ford, anopposition vice presidential candidate in last May's Panamanianelection.   Ford did not answer directly when asked if the United Statesshould have intervened in behalf of the insurgents. Instead hecalled on the Panamanian military to try again.   ``We were surprised by the coup attempt, but we feel that thedefense forces should put their act together and get rid of Mr.Noriega,'' Ford said.   Speaking on ``CBS This Morning,'' Cheney also said the UnitedStates has given sanctuary to the family of one of the coup leaders.   A communique issued in Panama by Noriega's government said fivecoup leaders had taken refuge at a U.S. Army base near Panama City,but the administration has not confirmed that account.   Alluding to a charge made against Bush during the 1988presidential campaign, Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., added: ``There'sa resurgence of the wimp factor.''   A large cross-section of lawmakers, both Democrats andRepublicans, voiced bitter disappointment at the U.S. failure tosend in military force to support Tuesday's short-lived uprisingagainst Noriega by 200 to 300 dissident Panamanian Defense Forcestroops.   Not all lawmakers were critical, however.   ``I'm convinced we did the right thing,'' said Rep. Earl Hutto,D-Fla., a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ``It wouldhave been foolish for us to take military action with loss oflives'' in the face of ``an obvious lack of intelligence.''   In public statements and briefings on Capitol Hill, Bush' menportrayed their caution as the only responsible approach to asituation fraught with confusion and conflicting information.   ``The president made the right decision,'' said Cheney.   Cheney said the initial report that the coup was to be led byGiroldi, a close Noriega confidant, raised doubts. ``This mightwell have been a setup,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
