He traveledto Mexico City in June 1984 and to Panama, El Salvador, Nicaraguaand Cuba the following month.   Neither trip was paid for by Jackson's presidential campaign.Supporters were asked instead to donate to a ``humanitarian fund''set up by campaign attorney Edward Coaxum, Jackson said.   Coaxum, a Cleveland attorney, didn't return repeated telephonecalls seeking further information and Jackson spokesman Watkinssaid he didn't know how much the fund raised or whether it wasincorporated.   It isn't unusual for public figures to travel abroad at someoneelse's expense. Foreign governments frequently invite congressmen,by themselves or in delegations, to visit, and absorb the costs.Candidates sometimes use funds from their political actioncommittees for trips that burnish their foreign policy credentials.   While Jackson has traveled abroad extensively, he apparentlyhasn't drawn a regular salary since stepping down as the head ofPUSH in 1983 to wage his first presidential campaign, according tohis financial disclosure forms and PUSH financial records.   From 1978 through 1980, he was paid about $50,000 a year as thenational president of PUSH. He received $54,615 in both 1981 and1982, the last year that he drew a salary from the organization,according to PUSH records filed with the Illinois attorneygeneral's office.   In 1983, Jackson made about $115,000, according to income taxreturns that he released during his 1984 presidential campaign. Ofthat 1983 income, Jackson earned $37,342 in speaking honoraria.   Jackson has parlayed his charismatic style into a prominentsource of income on the lecture circuit since his 1984 campaign,according to his financial disclosure statement filed with theFederal Election Commission.   In August 1984, he started Personalities International Inc., acompany run out of his Chicago home, to receive his speaking feesand other income, according to his attorney, John Bustamante.   Jackson was paid $192,090 by Personaliministration simply doesn't wanta trade bill, that'sthe long and the short of it,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.Byrd, D-W.Va., declared. ``Now the president can run but he can'thide. He's going to get a bill.''   Senate passage of the bill produced by a House-Senate conferencecommittee was a foregone conclusion. The question was whetherDemocrats could win the two-thirds support needed to override thethreatened veto. But there also was a question of whether thatmargin would hold up during a future vote to override PresidentReagan's veto.   The administration and the Democratic leadership went down tothe wire with lobbying efforts, but the race appeared too close tocall, lawmakers said.   Reagan renewed his veto threat and promised to work later for amilder version in a letter Tuesday to Senate Minority Leader BobDole, R-Kan.   Reagan called on lawmakers to ``finish the trade bill process ina way that serves America's interests _ not the special interests.''   Most administration fire has been directed at a provision thatwould require all but the smallest companies to provide theiremployees with 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scalelayoffs.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., defended the embattledplant-closings provision, saying 40,000 plants have shut down inthis decade of increased foreign competition.   ``Nearly 2 million people have lost their jobs each year,''Kennedy said. ``Yet the administration does not want workers toknow their jobs are in danger and to have time to plan for new waysto provide for their families.''   The administration dangled the prospect of a slimmed downversion of the bill, minus the plant-closings and perhaps otherprovisions, once Congress has sustained Reagan's expected veto ofthe current measure.   But Democratic leaders said this could be the last chance tosupport trade legislation before the fall election campaign.   The House passed the bill last Thursday, 312-107, more thanenough to override a veto.   The bill would overhaul the system under which the United Statesimposes import curbs and takes other steps to retaliate againstinternational trade violations and other unfair practices.   Authority to retaliate would be transferred from the presidentto the U.S. trade representative. Retaliation would be mandatorybut the bill provides five broadly phrased exceptions, such asthreats to national security.   Main provisions also streamline the means by which the UnitedStates imposes import restrictions to protect American businessesthreatened by surges in import competition.   But the 1,000-page measure contains hundreds of additionalprovisions, ranging from billions of dollars in agriculturalsubsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies.   Government aid to workers left jobless by import competitionwould be expanded. Trade sanctions would be imposed on Japan'sToshiba Corp., one of its subsidiaries and the Norwegian company ofKongsberg Vapenfabrikk for sale of submarine silencing equipment tothe Soviet Union.   The measure would assist Americans in defending themselvesagainst bribery charges brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practicesact because of payments made by their agents overseas. It wouldease some export curbs on high-tech equipment subject torestriction because of its potential military uses.   A maze of minor provisions governs trade in everything fromcranberries to canteloupes.   Democratic leaders gave up efforts Wednesday to win support fromAlaska's Republican senators by unsnarling a dispute over themeasure's curbs on export of North Slope oil. Byrd said attempts toresolve the matter ran into procedural roadblocks.   Several Republicans have expressed irritation at theadministration's heavy focus on the plant-closings provision as thereason to oppose the bill.   ``Frankly, some of us think there ought to be a strongerreason,'' Dole told reporters Wednesday. ``It puts Republicans onthe side, at least the perception out there, of being against thepoor working man and women who get only four-day notice.''   The administration, supported by a number of business groups,has been contending that the measure would actually blunt thenation's trade competitive edge rather than sharpen it.</TEXT></DOC>
