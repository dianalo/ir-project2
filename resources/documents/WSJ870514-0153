But in financial-services advertising, it's looking more and more like old times. The bull charged back into Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s ads last fall. Travelers Corp. has made its 27-year-old red umbrella logo the star of TV commercials. And this month, ads for ITT Corp.'s Hartford Insurance Group resurrect the stag, a corporate symbol that dates back as far as Abraham Lincoln's homeowner's policy.    This return to the past reflects the difficulties companies have encountered in promoting financial services to consumers. Advertisers are finding that longtime symbols are reassuring to people who feel bewildered by the blurring roles of banks, brokerage houses and insurance companies. The symbols also can help a marketer make an impression in today's cluttered advertising environment. &quot;If you've got a well-known logo that's already stuck in people's minds, for Pete's sake use it,&quot; advises Tom Garbett, a corporate-advertising consultant. &quot;Symbols are especially valuable for an abstract commodity like insurance.&quot;    During the 1970s, consumers were charmed by Hartford Insurance ads that showed a stag prancing down city streets, peering in windows and supervising children boarding a school bus. But he was retired in 1981, when the company decided to pitch specific types of insurance policies in &quot;harder hitting&quot; ads. Without the deer, however, the Hartford name faded in people's minds. Unaided awareness -- a measure of how many consumers mention Hartford when asked to name insurance companies -- dropped to 7% from 14%.    NOW IT'S UP TO THE STAG to repair the damage. &quot;Our research found that most consumers still associate the stag with the Hartford despite its absence,&quot; says John Daly, director of creative communications. &quot;The animal will convey that we're old and reliable, which is especially important at a time when some insurance companies are struggling.&quot; Lawrence, the European red stag in the new commercials, also appeared in Hartford's ads in the 1970s and in the movie &quot;The Deer Hunter.&quot;    Based on other companies' experiences with reviving corporate symbols, Lawrence just might be a hit. Claudia Marshall, vice president of marketing at Travelers, says awareness of the insurance company has increased 33% in the past year and the umbrella is now mentioned more often in Travelers' consumer research than even the Prudential rock. Consumer awareness of the Merrill Lynch bull is running &quot;10 to 15 percentage points higher,&quot; according to Harry Clark, a senior vice president at Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon andamp; Eckhardt, Merrill's ad agency. &quot;It was clearly a mistake,&quot; he says, &quot;when Merrill deserted the bull a few years ago.&quot;    While the symbols are old, marketers are trying to present them in catchy new ways. Hartford, for example, decided to go high tech. Its new commercials feature a special-effects technique called &quot;pixelization,&quot; whereby hundreds of tiny squares gradually appear on the screen until they form a complete picture of the stag.    &quot;When we talked about using the umbrella in ads, I asked, 'How in the world do you make an umbrella interesting?'&quot; Ms. Marshall recalls. Ad agency William Esty met the challenge: This year's commercials show a constellation of stars in the shape of the Travelers umbrella and doctors examining an X-ray of the umbrella.    ---   Gourmet Foods Are Going to the Dogs    If spooning out canned dog food turns your stomach, Carnation Co. believes it has just the product for you. Called Grand Gourmet, the new dog food was created to look like beef bourguignon. Well almost. &quot;Our research shows that people are ready for an upscale dog food,&quot; says Alfred Piergallini, a Carnation vice president. &quot;They want something that looks appetizing.&quot;    But whether consumers will pay an extra 10 to 20 cents a can for dog food remains to be seen. While small companies have sold expensive, gourmet quality dog food through pet shops and veterinarians for some time, the big national manufacturers are just beginning to try marketing &quot;superpremium&quot; products for Fido in grocery stores. Carnation introduced Grand Gourmet in March in East Coast supermarkets. The month before, Ralston Purina Co. began the national rollout of O.N.E., a pricey, high-nutrition dry dog food. It also is testing Bone Appetit canned dog food in Houston and Pittsburgh. Quaker Oats Co., meanwhile, is selling Pupperoni dog treats and has gourmet King Kuts dog food in test market.    &quot;The pet food industry is starting to catch up with the trend toward healthier and premium-quality human food,&quot; says Ed Ogiba, managing director of Product Initiatives, a consulting firm.    These products could spur dog food sales, which have been flat at $3.1 billion. In contrast, the $2 billion cat-food market has been growing 5% to 8% annually now that cats have surpassed dogs as the most popular house pet in America. Felines got gourmet goodies a bit sooner than dogs. In 1983, Carnation developed Fancy Feast, and H.J. Heinz Co. followed suit with Amore gourmet cat food.    While cat and dog delicacies seem to be in sync with the times, there may be only limited demand for them. &quot;Much to our chagrin, people tend to feed Fancy Feast to their cats only on special occasions,&quot; says Carnation's Mr. Piergallini. One tony cat food already flopped in test market: Ralston's Catviar, which was sold in a gold and burgundy bag showing a cat in tuxedo, bow tie and monocle. </TEXT></DOC>
