COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pilot-management group seeking to buy theparent of United Airlines said the $6.75 billion deal isn't deaddespite a failure to obtain financing, which sent the stock marketinto a free fall.   ``It has been a 3{-year struggle to get where we were thismorning, anyway, and this is just another obstacle _ one of many wehope to overcome _ as we have all along,'' Hank Krakowski, aspokesman for the pilots' union, said Friday.   His spoke after the group representing United pilots andmanagement announced it had failed to get adequate financing forits bid to buy UAL Corp., parent of the nation's second-largestairline.   The announcement helped trigger a drop of almost 191 points inthe Dow Jones industrial average, the biggest point drop since thecrash of 1987, and cast doubt on the prospect for otherdebt-financed takeovers.   ``I think the deal has hit a stumbling block. I don't think it'sdead by any means,'' said analyst Louis A. Marckesano, who followsairlines for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``Ithink the market overreacted.''   The pilot-management group said banks arranging financing forthe proposed $300-a-share acquisition of UAL indicated they had notreceived sufficient commitments to complete the buyout at thatprice.   But the group _ which also includes British Airways PLC _ saidit expected to revise the proposal and continue its attempts to buythe company.   In London, British Airways said it was confident the group stillwould be able to raise the necessary financing.   Marckesano predicted it would be Wednesday before the groupwould be able to say whether it could pull commitments together forthe deal.   One unanswered question, he said, is the status of the recentlyrejected bid for UAL by California billionaire Marvin Davis, whosequest for the company prompted the pilot-management group to makeits offer in August.   Jim Fingeroth, a spokesman for Davis, said in New York thatDavis had no statement after Friday's events. Davis had bid $6.19billion, or $275 a share.   But Davis said last month he would be willing to match the $6.75billion buyout offer of the pilot-management group if that dealcollapsed. He also said he would demand no labor concessions _ akey point for unions.   Nevertheless, Krakowski said the pilot-management bid wasattractive in large part because it included an employee stockownership plan.   ``And under current ESOP tax laws, the tax savings availableallow us to service the debt, even in a recession, to a muchgreater degree than, say, a Marvin Davis, or an outside raidercould,'' he said in an interview on WBBM-AM radio late Friday.   Under the proposed offer, UAL workers would own 75 percent ofthe company, management would hold 10 percent and British Airwayswould own 15 percent.   UAL issued a statement that its board would review any revisedproposal it received from the pilot-management group and wouldreview all other financial or strategic alternatives available toit.   In September, Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank committed $3billion to finance the buyout and were to obtain commitments for anadditional $4.2 billion.   Spokespersons from the two banks did not return telephone callsseeking comment Friday. However, a spokesman for British Airwayssaid he understood the financing collapsed because Japanese banksdropped out of the deal.   The 7,000 union pilots at United had tried to enlist the supportof the Machinists' and flight attendants' unions. But theMachinists, representing 25,000 of United's 70,000 workers,vehemently opposed the buyout, saying it was overpriced and wouldcripple the airline with too much debt.   Trading in UAL stock was halted because of the group'sannouncement, but the airline's shares still fell $5.50 to close at$279.75.   Friday's developments also cast a pall over shares of othercompanies involved in or planning debt-financed deals. They includeAmerican Airlinles' parent AMR Corp., subject of a $7 billionbuyout offer from Donald Trump.</TEXT></DOC>
