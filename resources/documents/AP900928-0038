ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown sayshis ``personal view'' is that Jesse Jackson won't make a third runfor president in 1992.   Right now, no Democrat is showing much interest in a 1992 race,and Brown said he intends to encourage the presidential ambitionsof prominent Democrats after the 1990 elections.   ``I'm not advocating smoke-filled-room politics,'' the partychairman said during a wide-ranging interview. ``I am advocatingcommon-sense, pragmatic politics which says we're serious aboutwinning the White House and which says, if you're serious aboutthat, you've got to take some risks and you've got to be willing totake some heat.''   ``We haven't been real successful five of the last six times andto ignore that fact is really lacking in good judgment,'' Brownsaid this week, referring to the fact the Democrats have electedonly one president since 1968.   Brown also said he won't urge the Senate leadership to grantfloor privileges to Jackson as a shadow senator from the Districtof Columbia.   ``I'm for statehood,'' Brown said during the interview. ``I'mnot into the perks debate.''   As for presidential politics, Brown, who helped Jackson in theclosing stages of his 1988 campaign, said, ``I think it's a tougherpolitical environment for him now, a more difficult politicalenvironment, more to overcome.''   Brown said he believed it was appropriate for a party chairanto urge people to get into the race and also to urge candidates todrop out when it is clear someone has outdistanced the field.   Brown said he was determined to ``get a consensus candidateearly in the process and start running against George Bush ratherthan against each other.''   In his two previous campaigns for the nomination, Jackson foughton to the convention, long past the time he had any hope ofbecoming the nominee.   But when asked if he had Jackson in mind when he talked aboutthe need to persuade some candidates to get out of the race whenthey no longer had any hope of winning, Brown replied:   ``I think there is too much emphasis, almost to the point ofobsession, with whether Jesse is going to run or not going to run.It's significant, but I don't think it's the principal factor inthe 1992 race. It's a decision he'll have to make and if he does,he does; if he doesn't, he doesn't.''   The chairman added, ``my personal view is that he doesn't run,''but he said that view was not based on any clear signal fromJackson.   In fact, in the summer of 1989, when Jackson moved to theDistrict of Columbia, Brown predicted he would run for mayor, aplan he still insists was Jackson's intent.   After mulling the race, Jackson announced he would not run.Instead, he opted for the symbolic office of shadow senator.   In November, voters in the nation's capital will elect twoshadow senators to lobby Congress to grant the city statehood.Jackson got close to 80 percent of the vote in the Sept. 11primary.   Jackson has not said he would demand access to the Senate floor,but his certain election to the post has spurred speculation thathe would make such a request.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has kept hissilence on the subject.   Brown said he thought it was a mistake for Jackson to run forshadow senator and indicated he assumes Jackson would seek floorprivileges.   ``That creates a very unpleasant confrontation with the senateleadership,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
