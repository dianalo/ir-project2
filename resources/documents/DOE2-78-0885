<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0885 </DOCNO><TEXT>The temperature dependence of the anisotropy field H/sub A/ and of thecoercivity of the mixed crystal series Nd/sub 18/(Fe/sub 1-x/Al/sub x/)/sub78/B/sub 8/ was measured between 100 K and the Curie temperature T/subc/. The intrinsic properties (like Tc(x), Ha(x) but also the latticeconstants and the concentration dependence of the spinreorientation temperature)indicate that a part of the Al enters indeed into the 2/14/1 lattice.The analysis of a correlation between xHc and H/sub A/ gives hints ofa decoupling between the grains due to the Al but it shows also the limitsof such attempts.</TEXT></DOC>
