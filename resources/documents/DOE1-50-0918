Resultsobtained to date from the Level 1 internal, fire, flood, and seismicanalyses indicate the characteristics of dominant accident sequencesand reveal distinct advantages to the integrated systems-analysis approachbeing employed. The extension of an integrated methodology to the accidentprogression, source term and consequence analyses will permit a quantitativetreatment of uncertainties in Level 3 risk measures arising from allstages of the PRA. A simplified version of these methods has been adoptedfor the NUREG-1150 PRAs.</TEXT></DOC>
