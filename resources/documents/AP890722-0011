Environmentalists and their congressional supporters argued thatPresident Bush caved in to industry's economic concerns andproduced a watered-down bill that would not fix the nation'sworsening air pollution.   Fay was not quite as harsh in assessing the legislation, whichBush presented to Congress on Friday with a promise to ``make cleanair the birthright of every American.''   The industry official said, ``The president's packagesignificantly strengthens the Clean Air Act to address ozone andcarbon monoxide'' pollution, as well as ``acid rain and air toxicsemissions.'' But he expressed concern that the bill moves ``in thedirection of limiting flexibility and economic growth.''   The administration Friday defended the measure on several fronts.   Bush invited key lawmakers to a White House ceremony at which heformally sent the bill to Congress. He assured them it would cleanthe air in U.S. cities, ``stop the degradation that's been causedby acid rain by the end of this century'' and ``cut airborne toxicchemicals from major sources by at least 75 percent.''   Later, the Environmental Protection Agency assistantadministrator for air, William Rosenberg, said the government wouldvigorously enforce a new law with civil and criminal penalties, andhave ``monitors at each smokestack.''   The bill's penalties would be imposed on those who tamper withauto pollution control equipment and on industries that exceedemissions from smokestacks, he said.   Rosenberg added that the EPA would not hesitate to use extrememeasures against cities failing to meet standards, including newauthority to curtail drinking water hookups _ a move that wouldstop construction of new shopping centers or apartments.   Fay complained that acid rain reduction provisions would notonly require utilities to reduce pollution from their currentgenerating output, but would force them into even costlier controlsif they sought to increase capacity to meet growing demand forelectricity.   The Bush plan ``will limit growth and options available to autility,'' he said.   Fay said he doubts the administration will be able to meet itsgoal of starting a clean-burning fuel program for cars by 1995 innine heavily polluted cities. He said too much research needs to bedone with such fuels, and added that industry pushed unsuccessfullyfor only a small demonstration program.   He called the bill is ``a disincentive to make gasoline burncleaner.''   ``We feel reductions in gasoline powered cars were better,'' hesaid.   General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and the Ford Motor Co.issued statements Friday saying they support the proposal but thatit's provisions would be tough to meet.   ``The administration's bill represents a very difficultchallenge, with some requirements that may exceed the autoindustry's ability to assure compliance,'' the GM statement said.   The clean-fuels program would require sales of one millionclean-burning cars a year in specified polluted areas from the1997-2004 model years.   The cities are Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Milwaukee,Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego, Chicago and a multi-city areaknown as Greater Connecticut.</TEXT></DOC>
