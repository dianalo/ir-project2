At the same time, the SEC suspended Thomas A. Grey, a first vice president of the Philadelphia-based brokerage firm, from associating with any securities firm for 30 days, and it permanently barred Samuel J. Bennett, a former Butcher andamp; Singer salesman, from the brokerage business.    In imposing the administrative sanctions, effective Feb. 2, the five-member commission rejected pleas for leniency from the firm and from Messrs. Grey and Bennett, who contended that an administrative law judge had been too hard on them.    &quot;The sanctions assessed by the law judge are fully warranted in the public interest,&quot; the commissioners said in an administrative order released yesterday.    In Philadelphia, Butcher andamp; Singer said it is reviewing the SEC opinion and hasn't decided yet whether to appeal. If an appeal is made, sanctions couldn't be imposed until it is resolved.    Howard B. Scherer, Butcher andamp; Singer's general counsel, said market-making in over-the-counter stocks constitutes less than 1% of the firm's total brokerage and underwriting business. Abstaining for 30 days from such activity would cost the firm $50,000 to $100,000 in net income, he estimated.    Mr. Scherer emphasized that the SEC didn't allege any violations of insider-trading laws by Butcher andamp; Singer or by Mr. Grey, but only by Mr. Bennett, the former salesman. Neither Mr. Grey nor Mr. Bennett could be reached for comment.    It's unusual for the SEC to mete out such a harsh sanction against a firm as large as Butcher andamp; Singer. With 600 employees in 31 offices, Butcher andamp; Singer ranked as the nation's 100th-largest firm in terms of capital last year.    Yesterday, Thomas Monahan, an assistant regional administrator in the SEC's Philadelphia office, wouldn't comment on whether the case had been referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution.    The case against the firm and the two men stemmed from the 1977 sale of unregistered common shares of I.G.E. Inc., a shell company with plans to develop an Atlantic City, N.J., hotel-casino, according to the order.    &quot;Bennett's misconduct was particularly egregious,&quot; the SEC said. He &quot;perpetrated a deliberate fraud on the investing public by selling some 180,000 shares of (I.G.E.) stock derived from certificates that he had forged or caused to be forged,&quot; the SEC said.    Mr. Bennett also made &quot;fraudulent misrepresentations&quot; to a customer and illegally traded in I.G.E. stock on the basis of inside information that he obtained as a consultant to I.G.E., according to the order.    In debarring Mr. Bennett, who had worked in Butcher andamp; Singer's Cherry Hill, N.J., office, the SEC noted that he had been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange for one year because of trading irregularities.    The firm and Mr. Grey were disciplined for participating in the sale of unregistered I.G.E. stock, according to the order. The firm was also cited for failing to supervise Mr. Grey effectively and for publishing I.G.E. price quotations without having on file required information about the company. </TEXT></DOC>
