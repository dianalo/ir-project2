A reshuffling of top managers also is expected. A spokesman for IBMdeclined to comment Monday, and the company's top management committeereportedly has not yet decided the details of the reorganization.;   IBM,which had revenues of $69 billion last year, has long struggled with thetrade-offs of being &quot;big&quot; -- five times bigger than its nearest competitors.While the company can offer customers a wide range of products in any cornerof the globe, the bureaucracy needed to set companywide sales strategies,marketing programs and technological directions has slowed the firm down.;  Meanwhile, smaller, more focused companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. ofMountain View and Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, which don't have to worryas much about pleasing existing customers or coordinating different units oftheir own companies, have eaten away at IBM's market share.;   The computergiant's share of the global computer market has fallen from 32 percent in 1985to 23 percent last year, according to the Gartner Group market research firm.;  In an interview several months ago, IBM President Jack Kuehler said he wouldlike the company's product groups to be able to &quot;operate in a moreunencumbered&quot; fashion. Today, the company lags behind competitors because itsproduct designers have to buy parts from within IBM, conform to certain IBMtechnical specifications and use IBM's sales force.;   Sources said Mondaythat the reorganization is likely to be simply a gradual continuation of adecentralization begun several years ago.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911119  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  346  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 19, 199100324064,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
