However, Mr. Silverman also cautioned that the talks might not end in agreement. Gruntal Financial is the publicly traded holding company for Wall Street broker Gruntal andamp; Co. The announcement came after the market closed yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Gruntal Financial rose 75 cents to $7.875 a share on volume of 71,500.    Gruntal Financial has about 10.2 million shares outstanding, which have an indicated value of $80.3 million based on yesterday's closing price. However any takeover offer would likely involve far more than that, since Gruntal has about $100 million of capital.    Speculation on a possible buyer centered on Home Group Inc., the New York-based holding company for Home Insurance Co. and other insurance companies and real estate interests.    Home Group, which previously has expressed interest in further diversification into financial services, was last night in the final stages of negotiating an acquisition, said George T. Scharffenberger, chairman. He wouldn't identify the target of the acquisition.    Home Group's stock price yesterday fell 25 cents to $20.50 on New York Stock Exchange composite volume of 84,300 shares. </TEXT></DOC>
