The officials of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries held their first round of talks in a luxuryhotel in this picturesque Swiss city.   They met for nearly three hours behind closed doors to thrash outa range of issues, including a long-term strategy and plans formarking their 30th anniversary in 1990.   But they decided to huddle privately before returning late Sundayafternoon to take a look at the world oil market and decide a courseof action for the last three months of the year.   The ministers are divided over whether the cartel should raiseits output by 500,000 barrels a day or so in the October-Decemberperiod.   Some worried a pickup in output would hurt oil prices and theircountries' needed revenues from crude sales.   The cartel's secretary-general, Subroto, said the ministers hadeight items on their agenda, ranging from plotting a long-termstrategy to marking the organization's 30th anniversary in 1990.   But the most heated discussions will no doubt center on thequestion of whether the cartel should raise its output by 500,000barrels a day or so in the last three months of the year.   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, the cartel already isproducing well over its production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels aday for the last half of the year.   Without reining in the overproducers, analysts say, prices couldslip a bit with increased supply. Gasoline prices at the pump wouldlikely be little affected, though.   Even before the talks began, the ministers were divided overtheir next step.   One side appeared to feel the market was steady enough andconsumer demand strong enough to absorb an increase.   Mana Saeed Otaiba, petroleum minister for the United ArabEmirates, said that ``there are some indications'' the market couldabsorb an increase.   A final decision, he said, ``depends on the market.''   ``If the market is allowing that, we will do it. If not ... wewill not increase the ceiling,'' he told reporters before the startof the evening meeting.   The other set of ministers clearly wanted the cartel toconcentrate on getting prices up to the its target of $18 a barrel.They feared higher production would weaken prices.   ``We hope that everybody will come down ... with what he isproducing so we can get to 18,'' said Libyan Oil Minister FawziShakshuki.   Nigeria's oil chief, Rilwanu Lukman, who is also president of thecartel, said the price of oil ``could do a little bit more.''   ``We would like it to be 18,'' he told reporters after hismid-day arrival in Geneva.   In June, the cartel set its target price at $18 a 42-gallonbarrel for the June-December period.   A benchmark of seven crudes monitored by OPEC recently averaged$17.04 a barrel. It was more than $18 last spring.   West Texas Intermediate, the key American brand, has been tradingin the range of $19.50 to $20 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
