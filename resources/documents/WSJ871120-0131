From a prime-time sitcom to an ambitious, cast-of-thousands life of Genghis Khan, there are dozens of ventures developing or approaching 1988 shooting dates.    Under Mikhail Gorbachev's economic reforms, Western film makers are being encouraged to seek joint ventures in the Soviet Union in return for technology, expertise and hard currency. About 10 studios and independent producers have signed deals and a number of others, including Inland Pictures, HBO, Orion, Viacom and ABC, are talking things over.    Hollywood's attraction is based on the characteristics of the Soviets' ponderous economy: Full employment is guaranteed no matter the market conditions, labor organizations are docile and the reasonably modern film-making facilities must be used. Therefore, the Soviets can provide huge amounts of services at a fraction of the cost Hollywood can.    For the Soviet Union, with its perpetual hard-currency crunch, making films with dollars as opposed to rubles is good business. Co-productions also give it an opportunity to reinvigorate its own industry and a shot at the world market, which is exclusively English-language films.    Ilmar Taska of the American-Soviet Film Initiative, a non-profit group devoted to furthering film collaboration, says the Soviets will cover up to 70% of a co-produced film's cost with set design, lodging, costumes, sound stages, studios and film processing. The Western partner is responsible for the hard-currency costs of scripts, directors, stars and other key personnel.    American producer Yuri Spilny, himself a product of the Soviet system, estimates that &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; -- which will use thousands of horses and costumed riders, plus battle scenes and construction of movie cities and a Chinese Wall -- will cost half as much as it would in the West. &quot;In the U.S. the per-diem expense for extras is $125 each, with the production responsible for their lunch,&quot; he says. &quot;In the Soviet Union the per diem is five dollars and they bring their own lunch.&quot;    As most of the jointly made films have either Russian historical themes or emphasize encounters between Americans and Soviets in which cultural and political differences are overcome by a common danger or human understanding, they are unlikely to raise censorship problems. However, Stanley Kramer's film on the Chernobyl nuclear-plant disaster may prove to be a test case. Mr. Kramer says the use of a Soviet writer now preparing the initial film treatment should &quot;relieve their minds that the story can be told objectively and as they see the facts.&quot;    &quot;They still don't make films in an open society,&quot; says Lawrence Schiller, executive producer of the &quot;Peter the Great&quot; series. &quot;I've been discussing a sequence about Stalin (on another project) that I refuse to change. They say, 'What difference does it make?' It makes a difference to my credibility. I don't want the network to think (the Soviets) are in control of my writer's work.&quot;    &quot;The real test is whether you can shoot a picture there as you would in any Western capital, moving freely to find needed locations and secure them,&quot; says Bill Bernstein, executive vice president of Orion Pictures. &quot;The relationship is not going to blossom . . . unless (the Soviets) are capable of handling truly international films where there is a broad market for the picture, there are cost savings and therefore a good motivating reason to go there to shoot the film.&quot;    The Soviets' receptiveness to film ventures also can be attributed to societal attitudes. &quot;Culture, as in France, is a major element of national prestige in the Soviet Union,&quot; says John Dunlap of the Hoover Institution. &quot;Everyone in the world watches movies, and so I think Gorbachev correctly feels this is an area to enhance the prestige of the Soviet Union abroad. Also, the restructuring of the film industry has been one of Gorbachev's more significant successes in the cultural sphere, and that's because he found a man to do it,&quot; Elem Klimov, first secretary of the Film Maker's Union. Mr. Klimov, a talented director whose own work has often been shelved by censors, is presiding over what the Soviets themselves refer to as a revolution within the film industry. Frustrated artistically and eager to develop a wider world audience, Soviet film makers acted in concert with the Gorbachev government to oust Filipp T. Yermash, under whose direction films suffered in quality, prestige and popularity, from the official film agency, Goskino.    Cinema also offers immediate rewards to Mr. Gorbachev on the home front. Glasnost, which is repeatedly translated incorrectedly as &quot;openness,&quot; means &quot;publicity.&quot; And that is exactly how Mr. Gorbachev uses this particular policy tool, to illuminate only part of the landscape: for instance, the rise of heroin use and of prostitution among young people.    According to Chris Wood of International Film Exchange, a distributor of Soviet films, during the past year and a half the Soviets have demonstrated greater business savvy and the situation now presents &quot;fresh people, artists who have a chance to express themselves. We're going to see more adventurous and universal themes as the Soviets acknowledge that the problems which exist in other countries also exist here. Also, since the French and Italian cinema are not now at a high point, this is a great time for the Soviets to bring forth their best productions and their best people to become a major impetus in the international film market.&quot;    Without question, into the bargain of coventures will go two entirely different approaches to film making. Western producers target an audience and then attempt to satisfy it. The Soviets, as a state policy since the 1930s, attempt to shape and lead audiences. In that policy's most primitive form, Soviet Realism gave the world thrilling tales of heroic potato farmers hurling themselves unsparingly into the struggle for communism. Still, official policy never entirely prevented production of outstanding films: Directors and writers became masters of subtext and are to be admired as much for their courage and determination as their art.    And collaboration may well have artistic benefits. For instance, due to Soviet cultural attitudes toward sex and violence, teen-age slasher films are not likely. Conversely, heavy-handed political statements aren't likely either, as Western partners -- whose idealism is tinged with materialism -- keep an eye on the box office. Hopes for joint-venture films were raised considerably recently by the critical success of Nikita Mikhalkov's hauntingly beautiful &quot;Dark Eyes,&quot; an Italian production with a Soviet director and writer, and several outstanding Soviet performers that opened the New York Film Festival.    But for Hollywood, the bottom line is still show business. Mr. Schiller, the &quot;Peter the Great&quot; producer, when asked about Soviet motives and Western aspirations replied, &quot;I don't want to make a film in the Soviet Union unless that's the best place to make it.&quot;    ---   Ms. Williamson is a film writer based in Los Angeles. </TEXT></DOC>
