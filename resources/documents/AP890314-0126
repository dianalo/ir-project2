The Illinois senator's comments are in ``Winners and Losers,'' acombination memoir and critique that he described in a recentinterview as ``a candid observation'' of the candidates in the race.   For example, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had ``a brashness of style,''Simon suggests in the book. Bruce Babbitt became a media darling bycommitting ``political suicide'' with a tax-raising proposal.Dukakis was too remote.   On the other hand, the Illinois senator gives Dukakis much highermarks than himself for strategy and dealing with public perceptionsat the outset of the battle for the Democratic nomination.   Simon had hoped to win the Iowa caucuses but finished second toMissouri Rep. Richard Gephardt and now blames himself for not actingmore pleased at the time.   ``My comments after the Iowa race should have reflected thatupbeat mood of the electorate more than they did,'' he wrote. ``Wehad no plans to look cheerful. The Dukakis team had planned to lookexcited about coming in third and pulled it off.''   Simon faults himself for other tactical errors, too, and forfailing to build his campaign around a central theme that would havebeen easily accessible to voters. But he also says he was hit by badluck at a crucial point.   He says he had a substantial lead in pre-caucus Iowa polls beforeGary Hart resumed his campaign that had been scrapped amid reportsabout an affair.   When Hart got back in, ``the roof fell in,'' Simon writes.``Polls taken all over the nation immediately showed him in firstplace,'' taking the spotlight from Simon though Hart did not mount acampaign in Iowa itself.   In a recent interview, Simon said, ``Gary Hart didn't get back inwith the purpose of hurting Paul Simon. The end result was that hedid.''   The book is the 12th by Simon, a one-time newspaper publisher,but the first intended for the mass market. Past efforts have beenexaminations of issues such as hunger and foreign-language education.   ``My last book was about unemployment in this country, andthere's just not a lot of people who want to read aboutunemployment. This has a little more general appeal, no questionabout it,'' Simon said.   ``We've had all kinds of people writing about what a campaign islike, but it's a little different when you're sitting in the chairof a candidate,'' he said.   Simon said he also wanted ``to reflect about what's right andwhat's wrong about our process.''   He characterized the campaign as too long, too superficial andtoo expensive, and he objected to a proposal for regional primaries,contending they would make success even more dependent upon money.   Although he sent copies of the book to his former rivals, Simonsaid none has contacted him.   ``The senator has not read it yet, but he hopes to as soon as hecan get the time,'' said Greta Creech, the deputy press secretaryfor Gore.   Aides to other ex-candidates voiced similar comments.   Gore was 39 when he announced his candidacy, and Simon says ``hisyouth occasionally showed in a brashness of style that time usuallytempers in successful politicians.''   Babbitt's proposal to increase taxes ``resulted in his becomingthe media's favorite candidate,'' Simon writes. ``Anyone who iswilling to commit political suicide in public ... has a ready marketwith political commentators.''   But ``as his failure to rise in the polls became apparent, Brucebecame a little desperate,'' Simon writes.   Simon blames himself for a number of mistakes, such as gettinginto the race ``without advance planning,'' sometimes misusingadvertising, failing to heed his advisers and ignoring offered helpfrom volunteers for Joseph Biden after the senator from Delawareleft the race.</TEXT></DOC>
