Don Hewitt should be ashamed of its most recentmanifestation. So should CBS.   What has happened to this country? Or rather, since thevoters do not seem deeply moved by accusations of pastadultery, what has happened to the media? Why do televisionshows with pretensions to respectability like &quot;60 Minutes&quot;and &quot;Nightline&quot; and even quasi-respectable papers take theirnews cues from a despised supermarket tabloid? What does BillClinton's love history have to do with his capacity to be agood president?</LP><TEXT>   Of course we have been through this before. In 1884, atthe height of the prim Victorian age, a &quot;despised Buffalorag&quot; (in the words of the historian Allan Nevins) ran a storyunder the headline &quot;A Terrible Tale.&quot; According to theBuffalo Evening Telegraph, Grover Cleveland, a former mayorof Buffalo, governor of New York and now the Democraticcandidate for president, had fathered, 10 years before, anillegitimate son. Cleveland had assumed financialresponsibility and, when the mother, Maria Halpin, became analcoholic, he put the boy in an orphanage.   At first, according to the New York World, &quot;The scandalfell flat. Not one respectable newspaper in the East referredto it, and only one newspaper of extended circulation in theWest.&quot; Then Republican politicians persuaded the BostonJournal to print the scandal on the front page &quot;with glaringheadlines, editorial reference, and all the devices which anewspaper may employ to secure attention to one of itsarticles.&quot; The Republican press took up the story, as Mr.Nevins writes, &quot;with cackling glee.&quot;   Cleveland wired an old friend in Buffalo, &quot;Whatever youdo, tell the truth.&quot; But he made no statement of his own tothe press. In those blessed days before &quot;60 Minutes,&quot;reporters did not harass presidential candidates about theirsex lives. Still the story thrived. Republican torchlightparades chanted, &quot;Ma] Ma] Where's my pa?&quot; In October, fearingthat the scandal would be &quot;enlarged and amended . . . justbefore the election,&quot; Cleveland wrote a friend: &quot;I still hearthat there is an intention to publish letters of a verydreadful kind written by me to the woman. If any such appearthey will be forgeries, and I propose to be ready for them.&quot;   Fortunately for Cleveland, the Republican candidate, JamesG. Blaine, though a model of devotion to his wife and family,had a tainted public career. About the same time thatCleveland began sleeping with Maria Halpin, Blaine, thenspeaker of the House, was involved in the celebrated CreditMobilier scandal, in which influential legislators receivedstock in a railroad company whose crooked dealings theysought to protect from congressional investigation. Theso-called Mulligan Letters documented Blaine's involvement,and Blaine's own notation on one of his letters to Mulligan-- &quot;Burn this letter&quot; -- became a Democratic campaign chantin 1884.   The Cleveland-Blaine contrast confronted the voters with adilemma. Edwin L. Godkin, editor of the then influentialNation magazine, asked: Which was better for the presidency-- a man who, like Oliver Cromwell, Benjamin Franklin,Alexander Hamilton and Daniel Webster, had been unchaste? Ora man who had sold his official influence for money and hadbroken his word in order to destroy evidence of hiscorruption?   &quot;We are told,&quot; observed a leader of the Mugwumps(Republicans who refused to support their party's candidatein 1884), &quot;that Mr. Blaine has been delinquent in office butblameless in private life, while Mr. Cleveland had been amodel of official integrity, but culpable in his personalrelations. We should therefore elect Mr. Cleveland to thepublic office which he is so well qualified to fill, andremand Mr. Blaine to the private station which he isadmirably fitted to adorn.&quot; That is what those stodgyVictorian voters proceeded to do. Democrats now chanted: &quot;Ma]Ma] where's my pa? Gone to the White House. Ha] Ha] Ha]&quot;   The 1884 incident is not irrelevant to 1992. What does itmatter if a presidential candidate has committed adultery? Acouple of political scientists wrote fatuously in the NewYork Times: &quot;If Governor Clinton has not been able to keephis marital vows, voters might rightly wonder whether hecould be trusted to keep campaign promises.&quot; Come on]Historians can easily expand E.L. Godkin's list of admirablepublic servants who failed to keep their marital vows.   I am reminded of the year when the Robert F. Kennedy BookAward was divided between David Garrow's biography of MartinLuther King Jr. and Elizabeth Becker's book on Cambodia,&quot;When the War Was Over.&quot; It was also the year when Gary Harthad his troubles. In conversation with the two authors itemerged that Dr. King, while a man of wayward sexualproclivities who conspicuously failed to keep his maritalvows, was nonetheless a noble leader who had greatly servedthe republic. Pol Pot of Cambodia, on the other hand, was amodel family man who never looked at another woman. All hedid was murder a million of his countrymen.   Can we not have done with the adultery test? If Mrs.Clinton is satisfied with her marriage, why in the world isit the business of some jerk on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to pry into theClintons' personal affairs? Is this what a heretoforereputable television program regards as a major issue facinga country deep in recession, its competitiveness in decline,its race relations worsening, its infrastructure crumbling,its cities rotting, disparities between wealth and povertyincreasing, crime and violence spreading?   Let's not be hypocritical in these matters. Any candidatewho could command the adultery vote would do very well in anelection. Does no one remember the biblical injunction thathe that is without sin should first cast a stone? And let noone forget Macaulay's comment that he knew &quot;no spectacle soridiculous as the British public in one of its periodicalfits of morality.&quot;   Happily the American public, if polls can be believed, isconsiderably more mature than &quot;60 Minutes&quot; or &quot;Nightline&quot; inits attitude toward sex. Life is complicated and not amenableto glib judgments. Privacy is one of the inestimable valuesof a free society. Prurience is one of the more degradingexpressions of human weakness. Pompous fellows interrogatingcandidates about their sex lives make the U.S. lookridiculous before the world. Let us leave private lives aloneand spend a little time worrying about the large anddangerous issues that shadow the future of the republic.   ---   Mr. Schlesinger is Albert Schweitzer professor of thehumanities at the City University of New York and a winner ofPulitzer Prizes in history and biography.</TEXT></DOC>
