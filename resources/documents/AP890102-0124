Arias is the author of a 1987 peace plan for Central America thatcalls, in part, for negotiated solutions to civil conflicts inNicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.   A tenuous cease-fire agreement between the U.S.-backed Nicaraguanrebels, known as Contras, and the leftist Sandinistas has been ineffect since March. Negotiations on a permanent end to theseven-year-old civil war broke down in September.   The Sandinistas suggested in September that future talks takeplace either in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, or in Washington.The Reagan administration has trained, funded and supplied therebels since 1981 in their war to overthrow the Sandinistas.   The Contras proposed in their letter on Monday that negotiationswith the Sandinista government begin Jan. 25 at the Washingtonheadquarters of the Organization of American States.   The proposed that OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Suares, RomanCatholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua and the foreignministers of the five Central American governments act as witnessesto the talks.   The Resistance leaders said they were willing to call an end torebel military operations in exchange for democratic reforms by theSandinistas. They also called for effective measures by averification commission to monitor Sandinista compliance with thepeace plan, which provides for democratic guarantees.   ``We consider it urgent that viable mechanisms be established toguarantee the independence of the (peace plan) verificationcommission,'' said the letter, signed by Resistance directors AdolfoCalero, Enrique Bermudez, Roberto Ferrey and Wilfredo Montalvan.   The rebel message came after Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyoconfirmed he plans to attend a summit of Central American presidentsscheduled for Jan. 15-16 in San Salvador, capital of El Salvador, toadvance the stalled peace plan.   The summit had been threatened by Nicaraguan claims thatHonduras, a key U.S. ally, has been harboring and supporting theContras. Most Contra fighters fled to Honduras after U.S. militaryaid expired in February.   The International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands,agreed last month to hear a formal Nicaraguan complaint againstHonduras over the rebels' presence in that country.   The World Court decision prompted Azcona Hoyo to threaten toboycott the summit unless Nicaragua dropped its case. Honduras wouldalso boycott a preparatory meeting of Central American foreignministers in Managua if Nicaragua didn't withdraw its complaint, hesaid.   In addition, Azcona Hoyo threatened to file a countersuit againstNicaragua before the World Court charging Sandinista army troopswith repeated incursions into Honduran territory.   But Azcona Hoyo confirmed he would attend the summit during anationally broadcast New Year's message on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
