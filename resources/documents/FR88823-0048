Theapproved proposals relate to the Call Reports of FDIC-insured commercialbanks and FDIC-insured state-chartered savings banks.As approved by the FFIEC, the term ``submission date'' in the Call Reportinstructions is now defined as the date by which a bank's completed CallReport must be received by the banking agencies (or their collection agentif the report is submitted electronically).A filing will be considered timely, regardless of when it is received,if it is mailed first class and postmarked no later than the third calendarday preceding the submission deadline. If an overnight delivery serviceis used, entry of the report into the delivery system on the day beforethe submission deadline will constitute timely submission.The FFIEC also approved requiring those banks with more than one foreignoffice (other than a shell branch or an international banking facility)that use any of the additional 15 calendar days allowed for the completionof their reports to submit their Call Reports electronically via the electronicdata transmission system that was implemented with the March 31, 1988 CallReport.The implementation of the term ``submission date'' will become effectivewith the September 30, 1988 Call Report. The mandatory use of the electronictransmission system by banks using any of the additional 15 calendar daysfor report submission will be implemented as of the June 30, 1989 reportdate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES: </T2>September 30, 1988 for the definition of theterm Call Report ``submission date'', and June 30, 1989 for the requirementthat certain banks file their Call Reports electronically.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, 1776G Street NW., Suite 701, Washington, DC 20006.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">OCC: David C.

The greater reliance on these reports as a meansof identifying, at an early stage, those banks which are experiencing deteriorationin their financial condition has prompted efforts to achieve more timelyavailability of these data. The agencies have made and are continuing tomake every effort to shorten the time required to process the reports.In order to improve the timeliness of the Call Report data, the bankingagencies proposed to define the term ``submission date'' and require bankswith foreign offices that use any of the additional 15 calendar days thatthey may use to complete their Call Reports to submit their reports electronically.The proposals were published for public comment in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 7, 1988. The comment period ended onJune 15, 1988. Ninety-four comment letters were received. Commenters includedfive major trade associations, three state bankers' associations, fourbank holding companies and 82 commercial and savings banks.The New York Clearing House (NYCH) supported the proposal to define ``submissiondate'' as the date by which the Call Report must be received by the agencies.However, the NYCH suggested that the mandatory use of electronic submissionfor banks utilizing some portion of the additional 15 days be phased inover the period to June 1989, since some of these banks may not be readyto submit electronically by September, 1988. Two banks made the same suggestion.The NYCH stated that, during the phase-in period, reports from these banksshould be in the hands of the agencies at least by the 45th day. The Bank Administration Institute (BAI) also supported the definition of``submission date'' contained in the proposals. BAI said: ``Differing interpretationsof this term resulting in a range of receipt dates by the banking agenciesare incompatible with achieving the Council's goals of expeditiously processingCall Reports and preparing Uniform Bank Performance Reports.'' In addition, the BAI recommended that the electronic submission requirementsfor banks with foreign offices be deferred until December 31, 1988. TheAmerican Bankers Association opposed the ``compression of Call Report submissiontime,'' lauded the move toward electronic submission of Call Reports, andurged the agencies to develop methods that would reduce the period requiredfor processing the Call Reports. The latter point was also made by a numberof bank commenters. A number of commenters observed that, in return for requiring completedCall Reports to be received not later than the 30th calendar day afterthe Call Report date, the banking agencies should also complete their reportprocessing earlier than at present and thereby increase the timelinesswith which Call Report data in general and Uniform Bank Preference Reports(UBPRs) in particular are available to banks and others. In response tothis suggestion, the banking agencies have committed themselves to completingthe production of the Call Report file, used to generate UBPRs, by the40th calendar day after the submission date. Currently, this file is completedby the 45th calendar day after the submission date. The Independent Bankers Association of America (IBAA) opposed any changesin the definition of submission date. However, they stated that ``* * *the bankers believe an earlier submission date would be feasible. Requiringcall reports to be postmarked for submission on the 20th calendar day wouldnot cause any undue hardships for the March, June, and September reportingperiods.'' It is the view of the IBAA that 30 days would still be requiredfor the December report because of the plethora of other reports due atthe same time. The United States League of Savings Institutions stated that the FFIECproposals did not go far enough indicating that savings institutions areable to meet a 20-day deadline when submitting their quarterly Thrift FinancialReports, which are more complex and cumbersome than the commercial bankCall Report. Among the 86 bank holding company and commerical and savings bank commenters,eight supported the redefinition of ``submission date'' and 78 opposedit. Many bankers who opposed the submission date proposals stated thatthey would not be able to complete their Call Reports within the ``required''27 days, perhaps not realizing that, if they were to use commercially availableCall Report preparation software and submit their data electronically,they would still have the full 30 calendar days to complete their reports.<ITAG tagnum="20">August 18, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert J.
