So why are builders of a new aquarium here planning a permanent exhibit to honor Big Oil's role in the Gulf of Mexico?    Because flattery makes good bait.    Officials of the Audubon Zoo, which will build and manage the aquarium, estimate that the facility will cost $40 million. To help raise money, the zoo has asked 14 oil companies to contribute $625,000 each to the project. As a &quot;thank you,&quot; the aquarium is promising to build a special exhibit extolling the oil industry as a nurturing force for aquatic life in the gulf.    &quot;We call it the Petroleum Wing,&quot; says one spokesman in describing the planned 500,000-gallon tank complete with oil rig.    Not surprisingly, the proposal has sparked some criticism. &quot;What is this exhibit going to be?&quot; snorts Willie Fontenot, an environmental specialist in the state attorney general's office. &quot;Let's see -- here are birds all covered in oil. Here's land with no vegetation where they dumped saltwater. Here's a bunch of turtles that were blown up when they removed the rigs.&quot;    Actually, offshore oil rigs are among the most popular fishing sites in the gulf, acting as man-made reefs that collect microscopic sea life, in turn drawing fish. But to credit offshore oil with environmental sensitivity is &quot;purely serendipitous,&quot; Mr. Fontenot says.    The oil companies themselves appear to be uncomfortable with the fund-raising project. Some executives, who refuse to be identified, grumble that the zoo's request was co-signed by Louisiana congressmen, making the oil executives feel as if they are being put through an old-style political shakedown. Still, several companies have made verbal commitments, says L. Ronald Forman, director of the zoo.    The aquarium has generated other controversy. Some people fear the weight of all the water will crush the wharf where it will be built. Others think it will ruin the charm of the French Quarter, or that the money would be better spent on the city's needy school system.    But while repeatedly rejecting school levies and other local taxes, New Orleans voters overwhelmingly approved a bond issue to help finance construction. After all, in an oil town, few are anxious to suppress a cultural attraction touted by its builders as &quot;a world-class project for a world-class city addressing the world-wide interests and concerns of the petroleum industry.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
