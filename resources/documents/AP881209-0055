Miriam Defensor Santiago, head of the Commission on Immigrationand Deportation, said some officials of her agency have madefortunes providing fake permits allowing Filipinos to work abroad asentertainers.   Officials say many of those who leave the country illegally arerecruited by criminal organizations in Japan and elsewhere and endup working as prostitutes.   ``I'm going to chop you into 1,000 pieces,'' Mrs. Santiago saidduring a television interview. ``I'll throw you and feed you to thesharks in Manila Bay. However, I doubt if the sharks would eat youout of a sense of professional courtesy.''   Mrs. Santiago claimed immigration officials at Manila's NinoyAquino International Airport had been faking arrest reports to foolher into believing they were cracking down on illegal activities.   ``These CID employees thought they could get away with it,'' shesaid, shaking her finger at the camera. ``I know for a fact thatthese employees have been presenting alleged arrests to me in amisguided attempt to lull me into a false sense of ignorance aboutwhat is going on at the airport.''   Mrs. Santiago, a former judge, said her employees ``have beenmaking fortunes from these illegal rackets at the airport rightunder my nose.''   In September, retired Maj. Gen. Cesar Tapia resigned as directorof security at the airport because he said he was powerless to stampout corruption there among immigration and customs agents.   In November, Evergisto Macatulad resigned as airport generalmanager, the third airport chief to quit since President CorazonAquino took office in February 1986.   The country's law enforcement chief, meanwhile, has ordered aninvestigation into allegations that police and soldiers are involvedin car theft rings.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the PhilippineConstabulary, issued the order Thursday after the highway patrolreported at least five military officers belonged to a car theftring known as the ``Silver Edition.''   A highway patrol report said the five were identified by gangmembers arrested in a series of raids in the Manila area.   Allegations that police and soldiers were involved in criminalgangs have been widespread in the Philippines for years.   On Sunday, Montano ordered the dismantling of permanent militarycheckpoints at the edge of Manila and warned soldiers againstshaking down travelers for money and goods.   The checkpoints were established to prevent communist rebels andright-wing extremists from entering Manila.   But travelers and bus companies have complained that armedtroopers extort money and supplies from passengers and operators.</TEXT></DOC>
