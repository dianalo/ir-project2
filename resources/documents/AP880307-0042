The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulingsthat bar Rita Mendez from exposing her daughter to any of herreligious beliefs.   The state courts also awarded primary residential custody of thegirl to her father.   In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. Mendez said herfreedom-of-religion rights were violated by the custodydetermination.   Rita and Ignacio Mendez were divorced in Miami in 1985, after afour-year marriage. Their daughter, Rebecca, was then 3.   Marital difficulties arose in 1983 over Mrs. Mendez'sinvolvement with the Jehovah's Witnesses religion. Her husband is aCatholic who, according to court documents, felt his wife had``betrayed him'' by joining the Jehovah's Witnesses.   At a custody trial, Mendez testfieid that it was not inRebecca's best interest to be raised as a Jehovah's Witness. Of the485 pages in the divorce proceedings transcript devoted to childcustody, 249 pages contain references to the subject of religion.   Two psychologists and one psychiatrist testified that Rebeccashould live with her mother, whom they called the child's ``primeparent figure.''   But the experts said contact with her mother's Jehovah's Witnessreligion was not in Rebecca's best interest because she needs ``toadapt herself to the mainstream of culture.''   They testified that a Catholic upbringing ``would allow her toadapt to society and have the freedom that Catholic children havein the society.''   Judge Phillip K. Knight, in awarding primary custody of Rebeccato her father, ruled that Mrs. Mendez should enjoy ``regular,frequent and liberal visitation, access and contact with the minorchild.''   But he also barred Mrs. Mendez from exposing Rebecca to ``anyreligious practices, attendances, teachings or events which are inany way inconsistent with the religious teachings and practices ofthe Catholic religion.''   A state appeals court upheld the custody award, ruling that``the record in this case does not support (Mrs. Mendez's)contention that the trial court made the father the primaryresidential parent ... solely because the mother is a practicingJehovah's Witness.''   In a dissenting vote, one appeals court judge said granting thefather primary custody amounted to ``an abuse of discretion.''   ``The child, exposed to the religious views of both parents fortwo years, showed no evidence of emotional or psychological harm,''the judge said, adding that the custody proceedings showed ``theexperts' personal biases against the mother's religion.''   ``Their disdain for the mother's religion induced them tospeculate as to the possibility of harm to the child in the futureeven though no evidence of harm existed,'' the dissenting judgesaid.   Lawyers for Mrs. Mendez told the justices, ``This court cannoteliminate religious bigotry in America but it can and should reviewthis decision, which has deprived a parent of her child because ofintolerance of her faith.''   The appeal added, ``The trial court's order places Rita in theanomalous position of having a constitutionally protected right tospeak to total strangers about her religion but not to her ownchild.''   The case is Mendez vs. Mendez, 87-1166.</TEXT></DOC>
