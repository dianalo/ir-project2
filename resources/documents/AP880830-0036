(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim and Tammy Bakker told attorneys theydidn't know where PTL's money came from or how its finances weremanaged when they led the television ministry, documents filed withU.S. Bankruptcy Court show.   In depositions filed Monday with the Columbia court, the Bakkerssaid top aides handled most of PTL's money matters.   Asked about six-figure bonuses given her, Mrs. Bakker said, ``Ijust know they (board members) put them in my account, and I spentthem like a typical woman.''   Bakker, who repeatedly said he did not recall seeing variousmemos about PTL's finances, was asked if he thought aides did notproperly inform him.   He replied, ``I was exhausted half the time and reading memos at11 or 12 (o'clock) before dropping off to sleep, and I could havebeen informed and would not even know it, I would have been sotired.''   The IRS claims Mrs. Bakker's annual salaries during her lastfour years at PTL were $84,964 in 1983-84, $142,586 in 1984-85, and$90,736 in both 1985-86 and 1986-87. During that period she alsoreceived bonuses totaling $825,000, IRS records show.   PTL records show that during those years Bakker, as PTL'sleader, received nearly $8.3 million in salary, bonuses and otherperks.   The Bakkers' comments were contained in 814 pages of depositionstaken under oath for a Sept. 12 trial in which PTL attorneys willtry to recover $52 million in ministry assets from the Bakkers andformer top aide David Taggart. PTL claims they grossly mismanagedthe ministry and took millions of dollars from PTL for theirpersonal use.   The Bakkers are suing PTL for $1.8 million for equity in theparsonage they once occupied. Taggart is suing for $185,000, ayear's salary.   Mrs. Bakker said she was unaware that she and her husband aresuing PTL for $1.8 million.   Mrs. Bakker, who was cohost of PTL's ``Jim and Tammy Show'' andhad her own program called ``Tammy's House Party,'' said in thedeposition that she didn't know how many bonuses PTL's board gaveher and didn't recall the amounts of the bonuses.   ``I would go to them and tell them they didn't need to dothat,'' she said, ``and they would always tell me, `Well, you'reworth more than that to us and we wish it could be more.'''   Mrs. Bakker said she and her husband were always careful to usetheir money _ not PTL's _ to pay personal bills.She also said sheand her husband ``have always been very, very open with theInternal Revenue.''   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., is investigatingwhether Bakker and his top aides committed tax, wire or mail fraud.That probe focuses on how PTL, under Bakker, raised and spentmillions of dollars in contributions.   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 afteracknowledging a sexual encounter with former church secretaryJessica Hahn in 1980.   Mrs. Bakker would not say when she learned of her husband'sencounter with Hahn. ``I don't think it has anything to do with thecase,'' she said.   Asked about a $10,000 expenditure of PTL funds for security at aGatlinburg, Tenn., residence he once occupied, Bakker said he andhis family had received threats.   ``A man came several years ago to murder my daughter and rapeher, and he is in a mental institution,'' Bakker said.</TEXT></DOC>
