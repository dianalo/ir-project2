Background </ITAG>A. Authority Under 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22, facilities may petition the Agency to removetheir wastes from hazardous waste control by excluding them from the listsof hazardous wastes contained at 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. Petitionersmust provide sufficient information to EPA to allow the Agency to determinethat (1) the waste to be excluded is not hazardous based upon the criteriafor which it was listed, and (2) that no other hazardous constituents arepresent in the wastes at levels of regulatory concern. B. History of this Rulemaking CFandamp;I Steel Corporation (CFandamp;I), located in Pueblo, Colorado, petitionedthe Agency to exclude from hazardous waste control a specific waste itintends to generate. After evaluating the petition, on August 2, 1988,EPA proposed to exclude CFandamp;I's waste from the lists of hazardous wasteunder 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32, conditional upon CFandamp;I meeting certainsampling, analysis, and reporting requirements. See 53 FR 29067. CFandamp;I petitioned the Agency for an ``upfront'' exclusion. A petitionerrequests an upfront exclusion for wastes that have not yet been generatedor that will be subject to further treatment. When treatment is planned,an upfront delisting petition requests that an exclusion be granted basedon untreated waste characteristics, pilot-scale treatment data if available,and process descriptions. As a condition of an upfront exclusion, the Agencymay impose batch testing requirements, which often include analytical testingof representative samples obtained from the full-scale system. These datacan be used to verify that the treatment system, once on-line, is operatingas described in the petition. The Agency may also specify verificationtesting limitations (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the maximum allowable levels of hazardous constituents ofconcern in the waste) in the conditions of the granted exclusion. Whenthe actual levels of the constituents of concern are below these levels,the waste will not be considered hazardous. If the actual levels of theconstituents are above these levels, the waste is still considered to behazardous and must be retreated or disposed in accordance with RCRA SubtitleC requirements.  This rulemaking addresses public comments received on the proposal andfinalizes the proposed exclusion. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Petition </ITAG>CFandamp;I Steel Corporation, Pueblo, Colorado <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Exclusion </ITAG>CFandamp;I petitioned the Agency for an upfront exclusion of its chemicallystabilized electric arc furnace dust (CSEAFD), presently listed as EPAHazardous Waste No. K061. CFandamp;I based its petition on the claim thatthe constituents of concern, although present in the waste, were in anessentially immobile form (<T3>i.e.</T3>, cement-like). Furthermore, to support its claim that boththe non-listed and listed constituents of concern would not be presentin the fully-cured CSEAFD above health-based levels of concern, CFandamp;Isubmitted results from total constituent, EP toxicity, and multiple extractionprocedure (MEP) analysis (used to assess stabilized wastes) for all theEP toxic metals, nickel and cyanide. The total constituent analyses wereperformed on representative samples of the untreated electric arc furnacedust. The EP and MEP leachate analyses were performed on representativesamples of the fully-cured CSEAFD as generated using a laboratory-scaletreatment system. The Agency evaluated the information and analytical data provided by CFandamp;Ifor its untreated electric arc furnace dust and its fully-cured CSEAFDgenerated from a laboratory-scale waste treatment process and determinedthat the hazardous constituents found in the waste would not pose a threatto human health and the environment. Specifically, the Agency used itsvertical and horizontal spread (VHS) model to predict the potential mobilityof the hazardous constituents in the petitioned waste. Based on this evaluation,the Agency determined that the constituents in CFandamp;I's waste would notleach and migrate at concentrations above the health-based levels usedin delisting decision-making. Since CFandamp;I's petition was based on alaboratory-scale waste treatment system, the Agency further used the VHSmodel to establish concentration levels (<T3>i.e.</T3>, delisting levels) for the hazardous constituents in thewaste to be generated from the full-scale waste treatment process. Theproposed exclusion set maximum constituents concentration levels permissiblein the CSEAFD generated from the full-scale waste treatment process andestablished testing conditions to verify that the levels of hazardous constituentsin the petitioned waste do not exceed permissible levels. The verificationtesting conditions attached to the exclusion are designed to ensure thatthese constituents will not be present in the fully-cured CSEAFD at concentrationsabove the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making. See 53FR 29067, August 2, 1988, for a more detailed explanation of why EPA proposedto grant CFandamp;I's petition for its fully-cured CSEAFD.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Agency Response to Public Comments </ITAG>The Agency received public comments on the proposed rule from two commenters.One commenter supported the Agency's proposed decision to exclude the fully-curedCSEAFD and the second commenter opposed the Agency's decision. The objectionsand comments raised by the commenters are discussed below. <T3>Petition-Specific Comments. </T3>One commenter opposed the Agency'shandling of information on CFandamp;I's stabilization process as proprietary.The commenter believed that without specific details concerning CFandamp;I'sstabilization process and the physical/chemical composition of the stabilizedwaste, their ability to provide ``meaningful'' public comment was seriouslyrestricted. The Agency disagrees with the commenter. As specified in 40 CFR 260.2(b),CFandamp;I is entitled to assert a claim of business confidentiality coveringpart or all of the information submitted to EPA in fulfillment of the informationrequirements of andSection;andSection; 260.20 and 260.22. Furthermore, CFandamp;Ifollowed the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 2.203(b) pertaining to confidentialbusiness information. CFandamp;I provided the Agency confidential informationdetailing the ``Solifix'' stabilization process. Substantial resourceshave been invested to develop the stabilization process, and CFandamp;I isrequired to protect this information in order to operate the licensed process.Furthermore, CFandamp;I did not seek to protect as confidential any waste-specificinformation. Data characterizing the physical and chemical compositionof both the untreated waste and the CSEAFD were provided in the exclusionpetition. The Agency evaluated all information submitted. Information thatwas not claimed to be confidential is available in the RCRA public docketfor public inspection. The same commenter stated that it strongly opposed the Agency's proposalto grant CFandamp;I an exclusion for the reasons discussed below. The commenter stated that the CSEAFD still exhibits one of the criteriafor which it was listed_the presence of significant concentrations of theinorganic constituents of concern (<T3>i.e.</T3>, cadmium, chromium, and lead). The commenter also statedthat the waste contains significant concentrations of nickel. The Agency agrees that the presence in K061 wastes of significant totalconstituent concentrations of the inorganic constituents of concern wasone of the criteria for listing K061 wastes as ``T'' (toxic) wastes. See40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(ii) and ``Background Document, Resource Conservationand Recovery Act, Subtitle C, Hazardous Waste Management, section 3001,Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste,'' 1980. The Agency, however,believes that data presented in the Background Document characterize thephysical/chemical nature of untreated electric arc furnace dusts and thatthese data are not representative of the physical/chemical nature of stabilizedelectric arc furnace dust having a cement-like waste matrix. Specifically,EPA believes it is reasonable to expect that, as the total constituentconcentration of an unbound or loosely bound metal present in a waste increases,the potential for the metal to leach from the waste also increases (generally,the higher the total constituent concentration of an unbound or looselybound metal, the higher the potential EP leachate concentration). Thus,wastes having significant total constituent concentrations of unbound orloosely bound metals are more likely to impact the underlying ground waterthan wastes having lower total constituent concentrations of unbound orloosely bound metals. In this case, because the metals in CFandamp;I's wasteare tightly within the waste's cmement-like matrix, the Agency believesthat the elevated levels of the metals present in CFandamp;I's waste shouldnot pose a threat to either human health or the environment. The Agency'sconclusion that the inorganic constituents of concern (including nickel)are bound in the waste matrix and thus are not available for leaching issupported by the results of the EP and MEP leachate analyses. EPA evaluated the potential mobility of CFandamp;I's stabilized waste usingthe maximum EP or MEP leachate concentrations and the vertical and horizontalspread (VHS) model. For the volume of waste to be generated by CFandamp;I's,the VHS model predicted a dilution factor of approximately 6.3. The Agencybelieves that the VHS model analysis provides a conservative and reasonableworst-case evaluation of the waste's effect on the underlying aquifer.The predicted compliance-point concentrations resulting from this conservativeanalysis were below the levels of concern used for delisting purposes.See 53 FR 29071, August 2, 1988, for a description of the modeling analysisof CFandamp;I's waste. Furthermore, in delisting evaluations, EPA considers all the factors forwhich the waste was listed, as well as factors other than those for whichthe waste was originally listed that could cause the waste to be hazardous.See 42 U.S.C. 6921(f). For this specific wastestream, based on the abovediscussion, EPA does not believe that any other factors, including elevatedtotal constituent concentrations of the inorganic constituents of concernand nickel, could cause this wastestream to present a hazard to human healthand the environment.  The commenter also asserted that the Agency only considered the leachablelevels of hazardous constituents and did not consider airborne and waterbornedispersal of the waste.  With regard to possible airborne dispersal, the Agency believes that thecommenter's concern was based primarily on the characterization of K061wastes in the listing background document as being fine particles or dusts.The Agency believes that airborne exposure to hazardous contaminants fromCFandamp;I's EAF dust (fine particles) is not probable because CFandamp;I'suntreated EAF dust will be regulated as a hazardous waste, thus releasesof the EAF dust to the atmosphere should be controlled. Additionally, dueto the physical and chemical nature of CFandamp;I's stabilized waste (<T3>i.e., </T3>monolithic and nonfriable), the Agency believes that directcontact from airborne exposure to hazardous contaminants from the CSEAFDis unlikely.  With regard to waterborne dispersal of the waste, it is important to notethat CFandamp;I's waste will be stabilized to produce a cement-like wastematrix and handled as hazardous until it is fully cured. The VHS modelanalysis described in the proposal shows that leachate from the waste thattravels through ground water will not exceed health based levels.  The Agency acknowledges that it may also be possible for surface waterrunoff to transport contaminants from the waste to a nearby surface waterbody. However, the Agency does not believe that anlysis of such overlandtransport of contaminants as a reasonable exposure route for the petitionedwaste would compel a different result for this petition. First, as describedin the proposed rule, the Agency believes that landfill disposal is a reasonableworst-case management scenario for CFandamp;I's solidified waste. Contaminationof surface water might occur, therefore, through runoff from the petitionedwaste. However, EPA believes that the concentrations of any hazardous constituentsin that runoff will tend to be lower than the levels in the EP leachateanalyses reported in the proposal due to the acidic medium of the EP test.Furthermore, any transported constituents would be further diluted in thesurface water body.  Second, the Agency believes that, in general, the leachate derived fromthis waste will not directly enter a surface water body without first travelingthrough the saturated (subsurface) zone where dilution and attenuationof hazardous constituents may occur. The VHS model takes this saturatedzone into account as it predicts the ultimate fate and transport of hazardousconstituents. Last, if the wastes were exposed to any long-term weathering,the Agency believes that any significant overland transport of hazardousconstituents through erosion and runoff is highly unlikely for solidified(cement-like) wastes such as CFandamp;I's waste.  The commenter further asserted that the at-the-well contribution of cadmium,chromium, lead, nickel, and selenium from CFandamp;I's waste alone wouldbe substantially more than half of the amount allowed in drinking waterunder the current standards for these contaminants (<T3>i.e., </T3>the predicted compliance-point concentrations (CPCs) forcadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and selenium are very close to their respectiveregulatory standards). The commenter, therefore, stated that disposingof this waste with any other contaminant source within the same landfillcould readily cause exceedences of the standards.  As the Agency discussed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 26, 1985 and November 13, 1986 (50FR 7900 and 51 FR 41085), the VHS model analysis assumes that there areno potential contaminant sources at the disposal site (<T3>i.e., </T3>leachate from the waste mixes with non-contaminated groundwater). Additionally, without specifying management conditions or consideringsite-specific characteristics, the Agency cannot modify the VHS model toassess the effects of additional contaminant sources on the underlyingaquifer within the same disposal site. The commenter is inferring thatwastes should not be delisted unless the predicted at-the-well concentrationsof the contaminants are significantly less than their respective health-basedlevels. The Agency does not have any technical basis to support a determinationof an appropriate percentage reduction and believes that any resultingpercentage reduction would be arbitrary. Furthermore, the commenter didnot suggest any technical basis for such a reduction. Therefore, in lightof the conservative nature of the VHS model, EPA will continue to allowwastes to exhibit CPC's up to 100 percent of the health-based standard. The commenter was further troubled by the CPC for lead since EPA is consideringlowering the drinking water standard for lead to 0.005 mg/l. The commenterbelieves that the waste should be considered hazardous since, if the 0.005mg/l standard is adopted, the calculated CPC would exceed the standardby nearly a factor of eight.  In making delisting decisions, the Agency uses the existing health-basedlevels cited in ``Docket Report on Health-Based Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988 (locatedin the RCRA public docket). EPA has no way of predicting the final drinkingwater standard until it is actually promulgated (the standard could beless than or greater than the proposed level or the 0.005 mg/l level citedby the commenter). Neither can the Agency be certain exactly when the newstandard might be promulgated. Without a new final drinking water standard,the Agency does not believe it is fair to the petitioner to postpone afinal rulemaking until a new drinking water standard for lead is promulgated. Lastly, the commenter believed that the Agency did not consider the possibilityof dioxin contamination. The commenter based its concern of the possibilityof dioxin contamination on data obtained through the Agency's NationalDioxin Study, Tier 4 Combustion Report. (See ``National Dioxin Study Tier4 Combustion Sources: Engineering Analysis Report,'' U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, ResearchTriangle Park, North Carolina, EPA-450/4-84-014h, September 1987.)  The Agency disagrees with the commenter. EPA evaluated CFandamp;I's petitionand did not believe that any other hazardous constituents, including dioxins,were present in CFandamp;I's waste. In response to the commenter's specificconcern regarding the possibility of dioxin contamination, EPA reviewedthe Tier 4 report cited by the commenter. Although data presented in theTier 4 report indicated that dioxins were present in wastes generated bysecondary copper smelters and wire reclamation incinerators, the Agencydoes not consider it likely for dioxins to be present in CFandamp;I's waste.As discussed in the Tier 4 report, the principal reasons for the possiblepresence of dioxins in wastes generated by secondary copper smelters andwire reclamation incinerators are the presence of dioxin-forming precursorsin raw materials and low combustion temperatures.  Specifically, the report noted that secondary copper smelters' raw materialscan contain quantities of polyvinyl chloride wire insulation (telephonewire), electrical parts, and other sources of copper (including circuitboards and electrical switches). Wire reclamation incinerators can processpolyvinyl chloride wire insulation and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)-containingtransformer cores and parts. These types of raw materials contain dioxin-formingprecursors.   The report also found that combustion temperatures maintained by both secondarycopper smelters and wire reclamation incinerators are low enough to promotethe formation of dioxins. Surveyed secondary copper smelting furnaces operatedat approximately 1500 anddegrees;F, and wire reclamation incinerators operatedat approximately 1000 anddegrees;F (some had afterburners operating at 1900anddegrees;F).   The Agency reviewed the list of scrap materials CFandamp;I reported it usesto charge its furnaces, and the Agency does not believe that CFandamp;I useswire or electronic scrap. The Tier 4 report states that secondary coppersmelters and wire reclamation incinerators are less likely to generatedioxin-containing wastes if they do not use polyvinyl coated wire and lowcombustion temperatures. Additionally, the Tier 4 report stated that dioxinsgenerally are destroyed at temperatures above 800 anddegrees;C (1472 anddegrees;F),especially in incinerators with residence times of 1.5-2.0 seconds or more.CFandamp;I's furnaces heat the molten steel to 3000 anddegrees;F. Therefore,CFandamp;I's furnaces run at more than two times the temperature requiredto destroy polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), PCBs, and polychlorinateddibenzofurans (PCDFs). EPA, based on the above discussion, does not believethat it is reasonable to expect dioxins to be present in CFandamp;I's waste.  <T3>EPA's Modeling Approach. </T3>One commenter supported EPA's proposeduse of the VHS model as applied to CFandamp;I's petitioned waste, and stronglysupported EPA's assertion that ``it is inappropriate for the DelistingProgram to consider extensive site-specific factors in its evaluation ofdelisting petitions.'' See 53 FR 29068. The commenter believed that itis unlawful and inappropriate for EPA to consider any site-specific factorsin its evaluation of delisting petitions. This comment does not pertainto this petition or affect the proposed decision since the Agency did notconsider any site-specific factors in its evaluation of the petitionedwaste. The Agency, therefore, will independently respond to this commentin terms of a separate rulemaking petition raising this issue with theAgency (filed by the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council).   <T3>Conditional Testing and Reporting Requirements. </T3>One commenterstated that if the Agency granted CFandamp;I an exclusion, the conditionalrequirements of the exclusion should include analyses for total constituentconcentrations and MEP constituent concentrations of the hazardous constituents.  The Agency disagrees with the commenter. The Agency expects that this wastewill be disposed of in a municipal landfill, where soil conditions wouldbe mildly acidic. EPA believes that the EP extraction procedure is themost appropriate analytical tool to evaluate the potential leachabilityof this waste in an acidic environment. For this waste, EPA believes thatcontinued evaluation of the EP leachable concentrations as required bythe conditions of this exclusion will be adequate to protect human healthand the environment. Furthermore, the Agency does not have health-basedstandards regulating the total constituent concentrations of any of theEP toxic metals or nickel. To require CFandamp;I to continually monitor forthe total constituent concentrations of all the EP toxic metals and nickelwill not ensure further protection of human health or the environment.  Lastly, the Agency does not believe it is necessary to require CFandamp;Ito perform continuous MEP analyses. First, the Agency's belief that thestabilization process is effective is substantiated by the analytical dataobtained from the previous MEP leachate tests. Additionally, if the stabilizationprocess were ineffective and an increase in the leachability of the hazardousconstituents from the waste were to occur, the Agency believes that theEP leachate analyses would measure such an increase.   The commenter stated that the proposed testing conditions did not providea schedule for testing the waste sufficient to ensure that it will continueto meet EPA's delisting criteria. The commenter also stated that, at thevery least, a program of periodic retesting should be required to verifythe continued effectiveness of the stabilization process, in light of thepotential for significant variation in the waste composition.   The Agency, when evaluating CFandamp;I's petition, realized that the concentrationof the constituents of concern would vary depending on the type and qualityof scrap metal charged in the steel making process. To address the possiblevariation in constituent concentrations, the Agency limited CFandamp;I'sexclusion to cover wastes generated from a specific percentage range ofscrap metals, including molds and stools, cast scrap, haystack and potbuttons, mill scrap, ferro process scrap, borings and turnings, miscellaneousfurnace scrap, and roll scale briquettes. See 53 FR 29072, August 2, 1988.The Agency reasoned that, by fixing the percentage of each type of steelscrap within the range used by CFandamp;I during the time period when CFandamp;Icollected its samples of unstabilized EAF dust, the variation in constituentconcentrations would be controlled to within the range that CFandamp;I demonstratedcould be rendered non-hazardous. However, while responding to the commentsconcerning the proposed testing conditions, the Agency realized that thespecifications of the Institute of Scrap Iron and Steel (ISIS) for gradingscrap metal were voluntary guidelines. The Agency, therefore, agrees withthe commenter that potentially significant variation in waste compositionmay occur due to the potential variation in the specific type of scrapwithin a particular category (<T3>e.g., </T3>mill scrap, andplusmin;1 bundles, andplusmin;2 bundles). Asa result, fixing the percentage of each type of steel scrap using the ISISgrading system would not prevent CFandamp;I's waste from exhibiting variationsin constituent concentrations outside of the range addressed by CFandamp;I'spetition.   Therefore, the Agency, in promulgating this final rule, has modified condition(1)(B) to require CFandamp;I to collect and analyze weekly composite samplesof the treated CSEAFD indefinitely:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1)(B) Subsequent Testing: CFandamp;I must collect representative grabsamples from every treated batch of CSEAFD generated daily and compositeall of the grab samples to produce a weekly composite sample. CFandamp;Ithen must analyze each weekly composite sample for the EP leachate concentrationsof all the EP toxic metals and nickel. Analyses must be performed accordingto SW-846 methodologies. The analytical data, including all quality controlinformation, must be compiled and maintained on site for a minimum of threeyears. These data must be furnished upon request and made available forinspection by any employee or representative of EPA or the State of Colorado.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Agency believes that it is necessary to require the petitionerto analyze weekly composites of the CSEAFD in order to ensure that thestabilization process effectively handles the potential variation in constituentconcentrations. As stated above, the potential variation in constituentconcentrations is a result of the potentially changing composition of thescrap charges. The Agency, however, believes that the composition of thescrap charges will not vary abruptly from day-to-day. Rather, the Agencyexpects that the composition of the scrap charges will change graduallysince scrap generally is not purchased every day. Therefore, the Agencybelieves that collecting composite samples on a weekly basis will be sufficientto ensure that the stabilization process is able to accommodate the potentialchanges in constituent concentrations and generate non-hazardous CSEAFD.The commercial availability of different types of scrap metal are subjectto change with time. Therefore, as described above, the Agency believesit is possible that the composition of the untreated EAF dust will varyover time. The Agency stated in the proposed rule, that future upfrontdelisting proposals and decisions may include different testing requirementsbased on an evaluation of the uniformity of the waste and that wastes withvariable constituent concentrations, including those discussed in previousdelisting decisions (<T3>e.g., </T3>51 FR 41323, November 14, 1986), would require continuousbatch testing. See 53 FR 29072, August 2, 1988. In this case, the Agencybelieves that the potential variations in waste composition (<T3>i.e., </T3>constituent concentrations) resulting from changing scrap,warrant the requirement for continual testing of weekly composite samplesof CSEAFD. As a result, the Agency removed condition (3) <T3>Termination of Testing </T3>in order to reflect the requirement forcontinual testing of weekly composite samples of the CSEAFD. The Agency is requiring the petitioner to compile and store on site, allanalytical data obtained through the subsequent testing condition (1)(B).The Agency realized that requiring the petitioner to submit these analyticaldate every six months, would place an undue burden on both the petitionerand EPA. In addition, the Agency, may at any time, either visit the facilityfor inspection purposes or request the petitioner to report these data.Therefore, the Agency is maintaining the same level of protection withoutrequiring the petitioner to report these analytical data every six months.Condition (4)<T3> Data submittals</T3> has been renumbered and now reads:<ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Data submittals: Within one week of system start-up, CFandamp;Imust notify the Section Chief, Variances Section (see address below) whentheir full-scale stabilization system is on-line and waste treatment hasbegun.

At the Section Chief's request, CFandamp;Imust submit analytical data obtained through condition (1)(B) to the aboveaddress, within the time period specified by the Section Chief. Failureto submit the required data obtained from either condition (1)(A) or (1)(B)within the specified time periods will be considered by the Agency sufficientbasis to revoke CFandamp;I's exclusion to the extent directed by EPA.

Specifically, the commenter statedthat (1) the EP leachate concentration of lead in CFandamp;I's waste exceededthe Agency's promulgated best demonstrated available technology (BDAT)treatment level for lead in KO61 wastes (see 53 FR 31138) and (2) the proposeddelisting levels for EP leachate concentrations of lead and nickel alsoexceeded the BDAT treatment standards (see 53 FR 29071 and 53 FR 31164,respectively).The Agency agrees with the commenter that there are differences in approachbetween some of the decision criteria used in individual delisting decisionsand those used in the Land Disposal Restrictions Program (LDRP). However,these differences are appropriate given the separate functions of the twoprograms and their different statutory bases. The Delisting Program andthe LDRP are fundamentally different in that the Delisting Program's standardsare health-based and the LDRP's treatment standards are technology-based.See RCRA section 3001 (42 U.S.C. 6921) and RCRA section 3004 (42 U.S.C.6924(m)), respectively. The Agency, however, believes that both the health-basedand technology-based approaches of the Delisting Program and the LDRP,respectively, are protective of human health and the environment.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Final Agency Decision</ITAG>For the reasons stated in the proposal, the Agency believes that the CSEAFD,when subject to the verification testing requirements specified in theexclusion, should be excluded from hazardous waste control. The Agency,therefore, is granting a final conditional exclusion to CFandamp;I SteelCompany, located in Pueblo, Colorado, for its fully-cured chemically stabilizedelectric arc furnace dust treatment residue, described in its petitionas EPA Hazardous Waste No. K061. The exclusion only applies to the processescovered by the original demonstration. The facility would require a newexclusion if either its manufacturing or treatment processes are significantlyaltered such that an adverse change in waste composition occurred. Accordingly,the facility would need to file a new petition for the altered waste. Thefacility must treat waste generated from changed processes as hazardousuntil a new exclusion is granted.Although management of the waste covered by this petition is relieved fromSubtitle C jurisdiction, the generator of a delisted waste must eithertreat, store, or dispose of the waste in an on-site facility, or ensurethat the waste is delivered to an off-site storage, treatment, or disposalfacility, either of which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a Stateto manage municipal or industrial solid waste. Alternatively, the delistedwaste may be delivered to a facility that beneficially uses or reuses,or legitimately recycles or reclaims the waste, or treats the waste priorto such beneficial use, reuse, recycling or reclamation.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Limited Effect of Federal Exclusion</ITAG>The final exclusion being granted today is being issued under the Federal(RCRA) delisting program. States, however, are allowed to impose theirown, non-RCRA regulatory requirements that are more stringent than EPA's,pursuant to section 3009 of RCRA. These more stringent requirements mayinclude a provision which prohibits a Federally-issued exclusion from takingeffect in the State. Since a petitioner's waste may be regulated undera dual system (<T3>i.e., </T3>both Federal (RCRA) and State (non-RCRA) programs), petitionersare urged to contact their State regulatory authority to determine thecurrent status of their wastes under State law.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule is effective immediately. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effectivein less than six months when the regulated community does not need thesix-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here becausethis rule reduces, rather than increases, the existing requirements forpersons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardshipand expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective datesix months after promulgation and the fact that a six-month deadline isnot necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010, EPA believes thatthis rule should be effective immediately upon promulgation. These reasonsalso provide a basis for making this rule effective immediately, upon promulgation,under the Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This rule to grant an exclusion is not major since its effect is to reducethe overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste managementregulations. This reduction is achieved by excluding waste generated ata specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enablingthe facility to treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additionaleconomic impact, therefore, due to today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.</T3>, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.This amendment will not have an adverse economic impact on small entitiessince its effect will be to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardouswaste regulations and is limited to one facility. Accordingly, I herebycertify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore,does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with thisfinal rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-511,44 U.S.C. andSection; 3501 <T3>et. seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261</ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste Treatment and disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffery D.
