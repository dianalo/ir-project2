The proportion of U.S. residents identifying themselves aswhite declined to 80.3% in 1990 from 83.1% in 1980. At thesame time, the proportion of Hispanics increased to 9% in1990 from 6.4% in 1980. Roughly half of those who identifiedthemselves as Hispanic, the most rapidly growing minoritygroup, also identified themselves as white. Asians andPacific Islanders grew to 2.9% of the population from 1.5% 10years ago.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, blacks became a slightly larger segment ofthe U.S. population, increasing to 12.1% in 1990 from 11.7%in 1980, and Native Americans grew to 0.8% from 0.6%.Although still an overwhelming majority in the U.S., whiteshave shrunk as a proportion of the population from 90% in1960.   Among Hispanics, the largest group remains people ofMexican origin, followed by Puerto Ricans and Cubans. But thecensus numbers suggest that a sizable migration of Centraland South Americans is under way. Between 1980 and 1990, thenumber of people identifying themselves as &quot;other Hispanic,&quot;a group largely from Central and South America, increased bytwo-thirds. They now represent 2% of the population.   People of Chinese descent remain the largest element inthe growing U.S. population of Asians and Pacific Islanders,followed by those of Philippine and Japanese origins. Inaddition, the census found significant growth among certaingroups from Asia -- especially the Hmong, who are frommountainous regions of Laos, and people from Bangladesh,Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Emigres from Southeast Asia and theAsian subcontinent have been arriving in significant numbers,but they don't yet represent a large portion of the overallpopulation.   Minority groups remain unevenly distributed around theU.S., with Asians and Hispanics concentrated in the West,blacks and Cuban-Americans concentrated in the South, andPuerto Ricans concentrated in the Northeast. More recentarrivals, however, appear to be dispersed less predictably.According to Jesus Garcia, a census statistician, growth inthe &quot;other Hispanic&quot; category was evenly divided among theNortheast, the South and the West, though it was slower inthe Midwest.   In addition, people of Mexican, Cuban or Puerto Ricanorigin are more widely dispersed than in the past. The numberof people of Puerto Rican origin living in Nevada andGeorgia, for example, more than doubled in the last decade.   &quot;When a group gets larger, it simply cannot concentratethe way it used to,&quot; said Marty Riche, director of policystudies for the nonprofit Population Reference Bureau.   Among Asians, those of Hmong descent were most numerous inCalifornia, Minnesota and Wisconsin, while those of Pakistanidescent were found principally in New York, California andIllinois.</TEXT></DOC>
