Specific technology-transfer programs, such as theactivities of the Center for Environmental Research Information, theInnovative and Alternative Technology Program, as well as the Small CommunityOutreach Program, are used to encourage the utilization of cost-effectivemunicipal pollution-control technology. Case studies of three technologies,including a plant-operations diagnostic/remediation methodology, alternativesewer technologies and ultraviolet disinfection, are presented. Thesecase studies are presented retrospectively in the context of a generalizedconcept of how technology flows from science to utilization which wasdeveloped in a study by Allen (1977). Additional insights from the studyare presented and the information gathering characteristics of engineersand scientists, which may be useful in designing technology-transferprograms. The recognition of the need for a technology or a deficiencyin current practice are important stimuli other than technology transferfor accelerating the utilization of new technology.</TEXT></DOC>
