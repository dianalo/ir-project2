(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Revisiting DBMS BenchmarksandM;The DebitCredit benchmark has become the most widely accepted standard formeasuring commercial systems performance.andP;  Although never intended as such,it has become--by common extension--the single most important gauge ofdatabase performance since its introduction in 1985.andM;Yet, while DebitCredit does an excellent job of measuring the performance ofon-line transaction processing (OLTP) applications, it is not an appropriatebenchmark for some other types of commercial applications.andP;  This articleproposes a new benchmark, the Set Query benchmark, as an alternativemeasurement for a group of commercial database applications.andP;  The importanceof this measurement becomes apparent from a review of commercial applicationsincluding marketing information, decision support, management reporting anddirect marketing.andM;These applications typically yield information of immediate and strategicvalue and are being referred to here as &quot;strategic value data applications.&quot;andO;Such applications can identify customers who return the most profit, forinstance, or can enable a company to increase it perceived value byforecasting customer needs.andM;Applications of this kind generally obtain such information by queryingdatabases.andP;  These queries are called &quot;set queries,&quot; meaning they access datafrom numerous table rows at once.andP;  In contrast, the DebitCredit benchmarkdeals only with single-row updates, a very different type of processing.andM;DebitCredit has gained prominence through ongoing refinements by theTransaction Processing Performance Council.andP;  At last count, this groupincluded 35 major computer and software vendors including IBM and DigitalEquipment Corp.andP;  Its efforts constitute an acknowledgement that DebitCreditis effective in measuring the overall performance of one particular class ofdatabase applications--online transaction processing.andM;Unfortunately, for other commercial database applications, such as strategicvalue data applications, DebitCredit provides no helpful measurement.andP;  And,the effect on database performance of the set queries used in such strategicapplications is often overlooked.andP;  In large part, there has been no simplemeasurement--such as DebitCredit--to determine how database performance isaffected by set query applications.andM;The Set Query benchmark presented here is a new way to evaluate databaseperformance with strategic value data applications.andP;  Early tests using thisbenchmark have demonstrated that set queries can have a dramatic impact oncomputer use.andP;  Moreover, these tests show a surprising performance variationin the processing of set queries by different database systems.andP;  Measuringsuch differences in database performance may enable a user to match anapplication with the most efficient database system.andM;The Set Query benchmark has four key characteristics: portability, functionalcoverage, selectivity and size.andM;* Portability is achieved by having all queries specified in Structured QueryLanguage (SQL), which most databases support.andP;  Benchmark data are generatedusing a random number algorithm but are representative of real applicationsnonetheless.andP;  This algorithm and the set queries published in this articleallow the benchmark to be run on any system.andP;  The use of other querylanguages--such as one of the fourth-generation languages--also isacceptable.andM;* Functional Coverage means that benchmark queries span tasks commonly foundin strategic value data applications.andP;  (See &quot;The Benchmark Queries.)andP;  Thisenables users to establish an in-house rating by weighting particular querytypes that are heavily used in their own applications.andM;* Selectivity in this benchmark is a term that applies to a clause of a queryand indicates the proportion of rows of the database to be selected.andP;  Forexample, a query that involves gender information would have very lowselectivity: only two possible alternatives exist.andP;  Because selectivity has atremendous effect on the performance of a query, the benchmark specifiesmeasures for a spectrum of selectivity values within each query type.andP;  Userscan concentrate on measures for the selectivities they expect.andM;* Size of the benchmark database is 1 million rows, each with 200 bytesstored in a single table, known as the BENCH table.andP;  The table size is largeenough to reflect commonly used application databases as well as highlightcrucial issues: first, set query performance differences are magnified onlarge databases; second, databases for these applications can exhibit rapidgrowth, underscoring the need for a valid performance measurement on arelatively large table.andM;Some exttensions to my benchmark have been proposed.andP;  A multiuser version isone I am now considering.andP;  However, the long response times for some queriesposes a challenge in deciding on an acceptance criterion.andP;  DebitCredit, forinstance, requires 95% transaction completion in one second.andM;The Problem With ScalingandM;The scalability of the database is another issue now under review.andP;  Adoubling of the database table size, machine speed and number of disks yieldsslower performance.andP;  This scaling problem is significant given the goal ofmachine and data portability.andP;  I regard test results as unrealistic where thebenchmark's 300 megabytes of index and data are contained in memory.andP;  Moremoney for memory usually results in more data to handle.andM;To obtain the desired variety in selectivity, the BENCH table uses 13 indexedcolumns.andP;  Twelve of these columns are randomly generated and vary incardinality--or number of distinct values--from 2 to 500,000.andP;  Each suchcolumn has integer values ranging from 1 to its cardinality, which isreflected in the column name.andP;  The remaining indexed column, called KSEQ, isa clustered primary key, with values 1, 2,..., 1,000,000.andP;  The values occurin the same order in which the records are loaded.andP;  (See &quot;The First 10 Rowsof the Database.&quot;)andM;In addition to these indexed columns, there are also a number of charactercolumns, s1 (length 8) and s2 through s8 (length 20 each), which fill out therow to a length of 200 bytes.andP;  These character strings can be generated withidentical values, since they are never used in retrieval queries, areflection of the fact that unindexed retrieval in large, low-update tablesis extremely rare.andM;Analyzing Application TypesandM;Benchmark queries were chosen from a review of common commericalapplications.andP;  Three major types of strategic value dataapplications--document search, direct marketing and decisionsupport/management reporting--were immediately apparent.andM;To determine if the query set selected was truly representative of theseapplications, I surveyed five companies with state-of-the-art strategic valuedata applications.andP;  Each was asked to identify queries from theirapplications that were included in the benchmark and to identify others thatmay not have been included.andP;  One addition was made: (query 2B: a Boolean NOTon some equal match condition).andP;  Otherwise, this query set was deemedrepresentative.andM;The first type of strategic data application studied was document search.andP;  Itobliges a user to specify one or more qualities desired in a set of retrievedrows.andP;  The application COUNTs the number of rows thus selected and returnsthis number.andP;  Usually a user further refines the set of qualities desired,adding new qualities and requesting a new count of rows so qualified.andP;  Theobjective is some smaller number (from one to a few hundred) of documentsdeserving closer scrutiny, at which point more detail is printed out.andP;  Forinstance, Petroleum Information Co. of Littleton, Colo., employs thistechnique of successive refinement to access 20 gigabytes of data on 2million oil wells.andM;These applications COUNT more often than they actually retrieve data from aselect set of rows.andP;  A series of COUNT operations is performed to obtain aselected set of rows.andP;  This may be at odds with the view of SQL thatemphasizes queries such as SELECT * ..., but it frequently appears in thisclass of applications.andP;  Aggregating functions, in particular the COUNTfunction, provide an overview of data that enables their significance to bereadily understood.andM;There are three general query types represented in document searchapplications: (i) ACOUNT of records with a single exact match condition(query 1); (ii) a COUNT of records produced by an AND of two exact matchconditions (query 2A) or an AND of an exact match condition and a NOT of anexact match condition (query 2B); (iii) a retrieval of data from records withthree conditions, including range conditions (query 4A), and from recordswith five conditions (query 4B).andM;Queries in Direct MarketingandM;Direct marketing is a second type of application that relies upon setqueries.andP;  These applications use queries to identify lists of individuals orhouseholds that are most likely to purchase a given product or service.andP;  Listselection usually involves two database actions: first, effecting apreliminary sizing and exploration of possible criteria for selection and,second, retrieving the data for mailings or other communications.andM;For instance, R.L.andP;  Polk andamp; Co. of Detroit is the largest compiler ofdirect-marketing lists in North America, collecting demographic informationon 83 million U.S.andP;  households.andP;  Direct-marketing applications can count, forexample, the households from a set of postal codes with annual incomes of$50,000 and up and which own a car from a list of make/year categories.andP;  Suchinformation can determine which households should receive a mailing.andP;  A countabove or below the target size will mean that a new query must be specified.andM;Retailers offer another example of direct-marketing applications.andP;  New YorkCity-based Saks Fifth Avenue tracks customers' purchases using an applicationcontaining 3.8 million records of 30 million purchases.andP;  Marketing analystsuse this information along with customer profiles to schedule mailings.andP;  Suchprofiles are determined from monthly crosstabs reports on cross purchasing;i.e., how customers' purchases in one department influence those in another.andM;The preliminary sizing phase of such direct-marketing applications affirmsthe importance of the COUNT queries with two clauses (queries 2A and 2B) andthe data retrieval phase where up to 10,000 records may be retrieved (queries4A and 4B).andP;  In addition, these applications commonly use queries where a SUMof column K1K values is retrieved with two clauses restricting the selection,one an equal match condition and one a range or else an OR of several rangescorresponding to a restriction of postal codes (3B and 3A).andP;  The SUMaggregate retrieves up to 25,000 records since it cannot in general beresolved in index.andP;  Thus, large-scale data access is assured.andM;Reporting ApplicationsandM;The last group of applications that relies heavily on set queries is decisionsupport/management reporting.andP;  This is a rather wide class of applicationsusually involving a batch generation of management reports, although aninteractive approach to supporting these operational decisions is notprecluded.andM;Managers frequently use crosstabs reports to focus business strategies.andP;  Forexample, the direct mail marketing division of Young andamp; Rubicam Inc. generatesreports from analyses of clients' demographic and psychographic data.andO;Crosstabs reports are used to show the effectiveness of promotional messageson a client's target groups.andM;The queries arising from these reporting applications include various COUNTqueries, as well as queries 3A and 3B, which return a SUM of a specifiedcolumn from a set of selected records.andP;  The crosstabs application representedin this category is modeled by query 5, a SQL GROUP BY query that returnscounts of records falling in cells of a two-dimensional array, determined bythe specific values of each of two fields.andP;  This is as close as SQL comes ina nonprocedural statement to a crosstabs report.andP;  Queries 6A and 6B exercisethe JOIN functionality, where data from two or more records in differenttables are to be combined.andP;  These are most often found in direct marketingand management reporting.andM;The Set Query benchmark has been applied to commercial database managementsystems.andP;  Tests have determined its portability size appropriate to asignificant class of applications.andP;  These tests also show variations ofsurprising magnitude among database management systems.andP;  These differenceshighlight variations in the database architectures.andM;Naturally, such variations translate into large dollar differences inresource utilization.andP;  The Set Query benchmark provides a standard measure toview strategic value data applications in relation to database performance.andO;Moreover, the benchmark enables database performance to be comparedconsistently.andM;References:  Anon.andP;
