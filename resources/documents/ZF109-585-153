 Knowing what kinds of hardware platforms will be invogue, which operating systems will be widely used, how important theconnectivitiy will be, and what role PCs will be expected to play incorporations then are all incredibly hard to predict.andM;Yet those are precisely the considerations that will shape the success orfailure of the new products being developed today.andM;From the customer's side, buying new PC products is at least as hard asdeveloping them.andM;Computer makers and, especially, software developers, complain that theydon't know what we want, and often can't find out.andP;  As buyers, our dirtylittle secret is that very often we don't know either--until we see it.andP;  Sohow can we tell developers what we want in our next-generation tools?andM;Defining what we want is hard enough for buyers, but living with thosedecisions can be even scarier.andP;  Say you see a brand new program, from a brandnew company.andP;  The program looks great; you're sure you and a lot of yourcolleagues at ABC Brands could use it productively; and it runs on the PCsyou have in place.andP;  An easy buying decision, right?andM;Not at all.andP;  Because when a corporation buys a few hundred copies of Release1.0 of a product, it makes a substantial commitment to that product and toits developer.andP;  The company wants to be sure that updates are coming thatwill enhance and expand the program, and it wants to make certain thatsupport will be available five years from now.andP;  And the company wants toguarantee that as industry standards evolve--the current move fromcharacter-based DOS to Windows is a good example--the developer will bearound to port the production to that new environment.andM;Corporate PC managers not only want assurances that the process willcontinue; they also want a say in how the product evolves.andP;  Who knows betterwhat needs to be changed, they say, than day-in, day-out corporate users,people using the product in the real world.andM;But all too often that wonderful new product isn't matched by wonderfulsupport, wonderful continuing development, wonderful management by thevendor.andP;  The company goes under, and the product becomes an orphan.andP;  Or thecode is sold at a bankruptcy court fire sale to a company that neitherunderstands the program nor comes how to support its users.andM;Either, users at ABC Brands are cut off from day-to-day support and fromproduct updates.andP;  They have no say in how the product evolves, because itdoesn't evolve.andP;  And the people at ABC who championed the purchase of theproduct are often in deep trouble.andM;The sums involved here are not trival.andP;  Say ABC Brands buys a thousand copiesof the new product at a corporate-discout price of $350 each.andP;  That's$350,000 up front.andP;  It will cost at least that much again to distribute theproduct, install it, train new users, and help them through their first,not-very-productive hours with it.andP;  So committing to the product costs atleast $750,000.andP;  And corporations don't treatthree-quarters-of-a-million-dollar purchase lightly.andM;STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPSandM;To solve those problems--making sure developers produce new products whichmeet real needs, assuring buyers of continuity and avenues for users' inputinto further development--PC vendors have over the past few years begunforging &quot;strategic partnerships&quot; with their largest and most importantcustomers.andM;Today, those strategic alliances are a hot topic.andP;  Vendors say they showtheir sensitivity to buyers' needs; corporate buyers brag about sitting onXYZ Software's Corporate Advisory Council.andM;But away from each other, and away from quotes for attribution, both sidessay they're unhappy with how these strategic alliances have worked out.andP;  Andeach blames the other.andM;&quot;Strategic alliances are a sham,&quot; the head of a top ten software company toldme recently.andP;  Hiw words earily echoed those of an IC manager at a nationwidebank I'd spoken with a few weeks before: &quot;Strategic partnership are a joke.&quot;andM;Under other circumstances this rift could be dismissed as perfectly ordinarysparring between buyer and seller.andP;  But American corporations' reliance onPCs has become so profound--many companies now find they have more investedin PCs, software, and peripherals than in their sizable mainframeinstallations--that reverting to an arm's-length buyer-seller relationshipwould be impossible.andM;These relationships are critical for PC vendors, as well: without feedbackfrom the trenches, they're likely to go off on tangents unrelated to our mostpressing needs.andM;Corporate PC buyers' two big complaints are that companies just don't listen(&quot;they come in here and pump us up, then nothing ever happens, we never seethe things we ask for come into the product&quot;), and that it's not a two-waystreet (&quot;the&quot;) ask us to redesign their products for them, but then theydon't tell us anything concrete about their release plans&quot;).andM;Vendors scream that corporate people don't appreciate their problems (&quot;theythink they know how to do my job better that I do&quot;), and that they'redisloyal (&quot;We put what they want into the next released, then they skip it,telling us the upgrade they asked for isn't worth the trouble&quot;).andM;Next time I'll tell you more about the complaints I hear on both sides, andI'll suggest some ways to bridge this wide gulf of distrust.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
