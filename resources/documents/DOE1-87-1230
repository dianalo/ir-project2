The coefficients are calculated by summations of microcoefficientsobtained by fine axial delineations of every subassembly. A special-summethod for obtaining effective coefficients for use in kinetics codechannels representing subassembly groupings is described. Evaluationsof rod-bank suspension coefficients and of grid-plate radial expansioncoefficients are also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
