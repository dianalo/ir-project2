 Many strategicallyoriented corporations have used improvements in hardware and softwaretechnology to restructure their businesses, introduce new prroducts, enternew businesses and improve development productivity.andM;Important trends in computer hardware technology include the rapid movementtoward a distributed workstation environment, major increases in theprocessing speed of microprocessors, ultraparallel processing, specializedinference processors, neurocomputers, optical-fiber communication, opticaldisks, all-digital, high-speed telecommunications and advanced microchiptechnology.andP;  It's important to gauge where this technology is going and whateffect it will have on the future competitive business environment.andM;For example, changes are occurring very rapidly in microprocessor technology.andO;The cost of chips in PCs has become much lower than the cost of chips inmainframe computers.andP;  This difference can be translated into the cost ofdoing a job.andM;The cost of mips (million instructions per second) on a large mainframe todayis about two orders of magnitude greater than the cost of mips on a desktop80386-based PC.andP;  There are several reasons why this is true.andP;  One is that thelead time to build a PC is about a year, while the lead time to build amainframe is about six years.andP;  We can get new technology into the PC muchfaster than it can be implemented in a mainframe.andM;The second reason is that there isn't much competition in the mainframe area.andO;A lot of information-systems executives worry about the fact that there isinadequate competition in top-of-the-line mainframes, while in the area ofPCs there is absolutely intense competition, which significantly drives downthe cost of mips.andM;The third reason is perhaps more fundamental: The mainframe is built out ofbipolar technology, and the PC is built using FET (field-effect transistor)or CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology.andP;  With bipolartechnology, heat is generated all the time.andP;  With CMOS technology, however,heat is generated only when the component is switched or when information isread from memory.andM;In the mainframe, we need high processing speed, which requires bipolartechnology and results in the dissiplation of a great deal of heat.andP;  Thisleads to a requirement for a large number of low-density chips and off-chipwiring--all of which make the mainframe processor very expensive.andM;The personal computer does not require very high speeds; therefore, CMOSchips that don't need expensive cooling can be used.andP;  As a result, PCs havehigh chip density, relatively few chips and little off-chip wiring.andM;Another new technology that has major implications for the future isneurocomputer technology.andP;  A neurocomputer contains large numbers ofelectronic models of neurons with a high degree of connectivity between them.andO;Neurocomputers are now available on boards that can be plugged intoconventional personal computers.andP;  These boards enable a PC to accomplish suchtasks as the recognition of the characteristics of a specific face, which wecannot do at the present time with the world's fastest supercomputers.andM;Although there are many potentially valuable applications of neurocomputersin business, most business and information-systems professionals don't seemto know much about them.andP;  Some of the applications are likely to be of majorstrategic importance in business.andM;Today's neurocomputers, although they can do things that the Cray 2 can't doin isolated applications, are nevertheless very crude compared with what wecan build in the future.andP;  An important question is, How many neurons can weput on a chip or on a large-scale wafer?andM;One of the problems with wafer-scale integration is that there is typically alot of damage to individual components, rendering portions of the waferinoperable.andP;  Perfect wafers cannot be made with current manufacturingtechnology.andP;  However, with neurocomputers, if some of the electronic neuronsare dead, there is little effect on the overall operation of the wafer.andO;Thus, there's natural match between the operation of neurocomputers and themanufacturing techniques of wafer-scale integration.andM;Similar arguments apply to making optical neurocomputers.andP;  Bell Labs isworking intensively on the development of optical neurocomputers.andP;  We canpredict how many neurons can be put on a wafer in the years 1990, 2000 and2010.andP;  We can be fairly sure that, by about 2010, we can build aneurocomputer with as many nurons as the human brain.andP;  however, theelectronic neurocomputer will operate 10 million times faster than the humanbrain!andM;What applications can such an electronic device perform?andP;  It won't be able todo the same things a human brain can do because we have such a poorunderstanding of what goes on in the human brain.andP;  It's likely theneurocomputer will appear simplistic compared with the human brain, but itwill perform simplistic functions extremely fast.andM;There are very important applications of neurocomputing in telecommunicationsand in defense.andP;  Neurocomputers will enable us to build intelligenttelecommunication networks and smart weapon systems that can recognize theirtarget from a long distance away and home in on it.andP;  The Department ofDefense recently announced a $30 million program to build aneurosupercomputer.andM;There is another fascinating type of chip coming into existence.andP;  It's a chipthat has physical components, not just logical components, and implementsmany different types of microsensors.andP;  For exemple, there's one chip whichcontains tiny whiskers, similar to tuning forks, that can detect low-levelvibrations.andP;  Other chips measure the flow of gases or air.andP;  Another type ofchip developed by IBM can detect exceedingly subtle motions.andP;  IBM built aballpoint pen with this chip in the tip of the pen.andP;  The pen is able toanalyze the subtle motions associated with writing and can be used to detectforgeries.andM;Over the last 15 years, we've seen the marriage of the computer andtelecommunications.andP;  In 1965, the telecommunications industry was completelyseparate from the computer industry, and nobody thought that they would everhave anything to do with each other.andP;  By 1995 there's going to be a largeamount of overlap between the companies that make things fortelecommunicating and the companies that make products for computing.andM;In a similar way, the television industry is completely separate from thenewspaper and magazine industry, and both are completely separate from thecomputer business.andP;  However, if we look at those industries in about 2005, wewill find a high level of overlap between the television and broadcastingbusiness, and between the newspaper/magazine business and the computerbusiness.andM;Those industries are converging as we enter the age of hypertext and hypermedia, intelligent television and intelligent books.andP;  Every television willbecome a computer and every computer a television set.andP;  Again we need to ask,what are the implications of the merger of technologies?andP;  Who is takingadvantage of it?andP;  Who is completely unaware that that is happening?andM;Most importantly, if we put these different sets of facts about technologytogether, what machines can be built with those electronic components, whatapplications will become possible, and what is the strategic importance ofthese applications?andM;Next week, I will look at the effects of improvements in technology onsociety.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
