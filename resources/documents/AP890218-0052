Gen. Prosper Avril hasreshuffled his Cabinet for the first time since he seized power in acoup last year, an independent report said Saturday.   The government named Col. Acedius Saint-Louis as the new defenseand interior minister and Augustin Romain Ceme as new justiceminister, according to radio Haiti-Inter.   Saint-Louis was information minister under Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy,who was ousted in the September coup. Saint-Louis had been denouncedas repressive by the presidential guardsmen who toppled the Namphydictatorship, and he was removed from his office at armyheadquarters after the coup.   Gilbert Austin, former minister of justice, was named presidentof the Supreme Court of Appeals, the radio report said.   The well-known opposition leader Daniel Narcisse was namedassistant commissioner of the newly-created Commission for HaitiansAbroad.   But the most unpopular of Avril's ministers, includingInformation Minister Anthony Virginie Saint-Pierre, remained inoffice.   Since the leak of an Information Ministry memorandum in January,Saint-Pierre has been widely criticized.   In his memorandum, Saint-Pierre said a peasant uprising, fomentedby popular organizations, was imminent and ``might have to be putdown with bloodshed.'' He recommended preventive measures.   An opposition leader said Avril's shakeup should have gonefurther.   ``These are not the reforms we were asking for. We will keep onasking until we get them,'' Serge Gilles, leader of the NationalProgressive Revolutionary Party said.   Last week, he demanded the ouster of what he views asanti-democratic elements in the Cabinet, which has remained intactsince Avril was swept into power by a military coup on Sept. 17,1988.   Popular support for his government, which pledged to restoredemocracy, has plummeted in the past month during a wave ofanti-government demonstrations and two general strikes.</TEXT></DOC>
