In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it sold 3.7 million American Medical common shares on Friday in a brokerage transaction at $17.42 each. It previously sold 2,000 shares of the company in an open-market transaction on Oct. 20 for $17.57 each, the filing said. As a result of the sales, the group currently holds 1.7 million shares. No reason was given in the filing for the sales.    Officials of Investment, Fort Worth, Texas, weren't available for comment. In Beverly Hills, Calif., a spokesman for American Medical said it was the hospital operator's understanding that the group sold the shares for reasons &quot;that were unrelated to {American Medical's} business.&quot; The spokesman said American Medical bought the shares from the group.    American Medical said Friday that it bought most of the five million of its shares that changed hands that day in unusually heavy trading.    Investment lists its general partners as Dort A. Cameron III and Richard E. Rainwater, a former adviser to the Bass family of Fort Worth.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, American Medical closed at $17 a share, down 12.5 cents, on volume of 204,500 shares. </TEXT></DOC>
