A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsheard U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Lambros argue for the right toconsolidate the cases before his court.   Lambros and nine other district judges from around the countrylast Friday issued a blueprint for a national class action designedto more quickly resolve 90,000 pending thousands of asbestos cases.The plan ordered consolidation of cases in federal districts innorther Ohio and east Texas.   But Thomas Hermann, attorney for Allied Signal Inc. of MorrisTownship, N.J., asked the appeals court to prevent Lambros fromproceeding. Hermann said Lambros lacks authority to consolidatecases from outside his Ohio district.   Hermann also argued that the 10-judge group lacks authority tocreate a mandatory, national class action. Hermann said suchauthority only belongs to the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress.   Allied Signal faces asbestos liability claims because thecompany produced brake linings and brake disc pads containingasbestos. Hermann said the company wants to handle those claimsseparately.   The appeals court did not immediately rule on whether to grantAllied Signal's request.   But appelate judge Boyce Martin Jr. directed Lambros to limitfuture orders to five plaintiffs who have filed requests with himto have their asbestos liability complaints certified as classactions.   Lambros has issued a series of orders in the last monthmandating creation of the national class-action for asbestos cases.He also has directed parties from pending cases in Cleveland andTexas to attend a Sept. 14 hearing in Cleveland to determinewhether Lambros should proceed with certifying the class-action.   Lambros, in an exchange with Martin, agreed that his ordersshould be interpreted only as official notices inviting plaintiffsto attend the hearing.   Judge Nathaniel R. Jones said the panel would issue a writtenorder to define the court's ruling.   The Federal Judicial Center reports that as of Jan. 1 there were29,466 cases pending in federal courts in which claims are made forasbestos-related personal injuries. An estimated 60,000 similarcases are pending in state court.   Some companies that made asbestos products are encouragingconsolidation. Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., of Cincinnati, isurging U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in New York toconsolidate thousands of cases in his court from companies who saythey can't afford to pay their asbestos claims.   The plan by the 10 federal judges would give Weinstein controlover a class action for Eagle-Picher and five other strugglingcompanies.   Lambros would handle a class action seeking to reach a singlesettlement and U.S. District Judge Robert Parker in Beaumont,Texas, would hold trials for defendants unwilling or unable toreach settlement agreements.</TEXT></DOC>
