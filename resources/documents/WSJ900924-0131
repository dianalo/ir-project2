The agreement was reached Friday after a week of talkshere to craft concessions that would persuade the Morristown,N.J., company not to refile its trade complaint.</LP><TEXT>   The petition, initially filed with the U.S. TradeRepresentative's Office last March, charged that Tokyo andseveral Japanese companies conspired to block sales ofAllied's amorphous metals, alloys that Allied claims can save70% of the electricity normally lost in conventionaltransformers. Allied temporarily withdrew the petition at theurging of U.S. trade officials to give them a chance tonegotiate a solution.   Allied had argued that the Japanese government helped somecompanies develop amorphous metals and had prevailed uponJapanese utilities to defer purchases of such products untilthe Japanese products were available and Allied's Japanesepatents had expired.   Tokyo wouldn't agree to extend Allied's two Japanesepatents after they expire in 1993 and 1997. However, Japaneseutilities will buy 32,000 electric transformers containingAllied's amorphous metals over the next 30 months.   Allied estimates the potential world market for amorphousmetals at $3.5 billion a year.</TEXT></DOC>
