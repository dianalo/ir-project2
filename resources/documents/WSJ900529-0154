The outcomewill have an important effect on the course of the economyfor years ahead.   To be successful, the fiscal package must include actionson both sides of the budget. It must be perceived by thecitizenry as fair. Finally, to make the trauma and travail ofthis year's efforts worthwhile, some therapy needs to beapplied to the basic processes of budgetry.</LP><TEXT>   It is important now for the federal budget to get somereal therapy. The reason is not that if we do not mend ourways some sort of fiscal explosion or financial collapse willoccur. No such detonation has obviously occurred or is likelyto occur. Seeing a crisis as the problem is itself part ofthe budget problem.   Policies do, however, have consequences. And the fiscalpolicy we have been pursuing is producing some consequencesthat suggest that we need changes. (It has also produced somedesirable consequences -- e.g., a little more reluctance tovote large new spending programs.) Clearly the budget hascontributed to the deterioration in the dynamism of the U.S.economy that has made its performance in recent years compareunfavorably with that of our own history or of otherindustrial nations. Turning this around and reviving theeconomy's capability to deliver sustained gains in realincome is the major challenge facing managers of economicpolicy -- and this includes both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.   In our pride about the increased number of jobs availablewe tend to overlook the fact that most of our increasedoutput has come from more people working, and too little hascome from doing things better, from things that enlargeoutput per person employed.   The result is that average weekly earnings in real termshave been declining in recent years, and in the early monthsof 1990 they had receded to about the level of 30 years ago.If we had sustained rates of increase more in line with ourhistory, or with what has been happening in Europe and Asia,today's average earnings from a week of work would be about50% higher in real terms, and the president and thecongressional leaders would have the joy of negotiating a taxreduction.   For years our investment has been low relative to that inthe rest of the industrial world. The rate of growth in theamount of productive capital backing up each American workerhas itself declined, and on average it therefore representsolder technology. The inevitable result has been thedeterioration in the purchasing power of earnings from aweek's work.   The federal budget has made its contribution here. TheTreasury's large borrowing requirements plus private creditneeds outpaced domestic credit resources for most of the pastdecade, with the imbalance becoming particularly severe bythe mid-1980s, and this has forced drawing on foreignsavings. This was no crisis and probably could continue, butit produces consequences -- to repeat, adversely affectingthe economy's ability to deliver gains in real income. Thehigher costs of capital had a deterrent effect on U.S.capital formation. And the net flow of investment income fromabroad (equal to somewhat over 1% of gross national product adecade ago) this year may be negative.   While there are differences between a sovereigngovernment's finances and those of a family or business orcity, there are parallels, and the consequences of living byborrowing are on that list.   To get the nation on a better fiscal path, actions on bothsides of the budget will probably be required. In principle,a tax system that already generates well over a trilliondollars of revenue ought to be adequate to cover what couldbe spent prudently. And there is a strong case for hangingtough on new taxes, and forcing the nation to take a harderline on spending.   The real cost of throwing more money at any interest groupthat is loud enough is some combination of reducedconsumption for average Americans, reduced capability for theeconomy to grow, and in many cases perverse and even adverseeffects on the very problems the programs were supposed tosolve. Developments in Eastern Europe as well as our ownexperience here would suggest that we re-think ourinclination to deal with problems through programs based on&quot;the primacy of politically directed social planning.&quot; (Thephrase is from Zbigniew Brzezinski's excellent &quot;The GrandFailure.&quot;)   Probably, however, it is unrealistic to expect a solutionby spending cuts alone. Visions of Russian peace, good will,and an orderly transfer to a liberal political and economicorder that would enable us prudently to wield a big macheteon our defense spending are fading a bit before newuncertainties. And behind every spending program, notexcluding defense, is a special-interest group ready tothreaten political oblivion for those casting negative votes-- and piously equating their program with the generalinterest.   A part of the needed budget package must, therefore, beincreased revenues. This will be tough for the members ofCongress who vote for more taxes, and whose folks back homewill not love them more in November for it. And it will betough for the president. This is, of course, the price thepolitical system is paying for our having jettisoned thefiscal discipline of the always-balanced-budget philosophy.   The revenue part of the package must be seen by the publicas fair, it ought to point in the right direction fornational policy, and it must be something that embodied inlegislation can be passed. There will be a good deal of theleast-squawk principle in any package. A European-stylevalue-added tax probably would not yet be seen by the publicas fair, and in any case it is outside the present structurefor tax administration. Somewhat higher rates for people withlarge incomes might have to be part of a &quot;fair&quot; package.   Higher gasoline taxes are also a candidate for morerevenue. The combination of federal and state taxes in manystates produces lower taxes in real terms on a gallon ofgasoline than before the energy crisis. The level of thesetaxes is quite low relative to those in most Europeancountries, and they are a revenue producer -- roughly abillion dollars per penny. A higher gasoline tax would atleast help to resolve national policies currently pointing inprecisely opposite directions. Through the legislatedaverage-mileage requirements that new cars are supposed tomeet (the corporate average fuel efficiency standards),national policy tells consumers to buy smaller cars. Throughlow gasoline taxes, it tells us to buy large cars. Notsurprisingly, the latter signal tends to win.   At one time higher U.S. gasoline taxes could reasonably becriticized because they would penalize the American autoindustry, whose comparative advantage was in producing largecars, and favor foreign companies, who specialized in smallcars. That difference is being blurred now as foreignproducers have moved effectively into the market for largerand more expensive cars.   This year's budget agony will largely have been futile andwasted unless it includes measures to strengthen basic budgetprocesses. A great many political brownie points will beexpended in any case, so some permanent improvement inbudgetry should be the result. Two sets of things are needed.   The set of financial statements constituting &quot;the budget&quot;should present a better picture of the fiscal operations andposition of the federal government. What with off-budgetfinancing, credit programs, and the failure to estimate thevalue of public capital expiring during the year(depreciation), the present budget does not even begin togive a true picture of the economic resources pre-empted bythe federal government. If a corporation sent a comparableannual statement to its stockholders, the Securities andExchange Commission would have management in court. It wouldseem not unreasonable to require of the federal government,which pre-empts more than a quarter of the national incomethrough taxes or borrowing, as high a standard of disclosureas government imposes on a business.   The budget process must also further fortify the defensesof fiscal discipline. When the benefits of programs arespecific to a group and the costs are socialized, the demandfor spending is, naturally, unlimited. The pressures arefurther intensified by a half-century of &quot;the primacy ofpolitically directed social planning.&quot; Clearly the presidentshould have the authority to impound authorizations and toveto specific items. Even stronger sanctions may be requiredto achieve the fiscal discipline needed for limiting totalspending.   Four years ago on this page I made a proposal that, ifimplemented, would do the job: &quot;To give teeth to the newprocess, a further provision might be added. For 12 monthsfollowing any year that the budget is in the red, no salariescould be paid to members of Congress, the president, ormembers of his cabinet.&quot;   That proposal, however, may not make it this time aroundthe budget track.   ---   Mr. McCracken, a former chairman of the president'sCouncil of Economic Advisers, is a University of Michiganprofessor emeritus.   ---                  Average Weekly Earnings                                                                                                                Total private nonagricultural work force                                                                                                                            (In 1977 dollars)                                                                                                           YEAR                                    AMOUNT                                                                                                           1949                                   $127.84    1959                                    163.78    1969                                    189.44    1979                                    183.41    1989                                    166.52                                                                                                           Sources: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics</TEXT></DOC>
