In its May 16,1988, notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (52 FR 17379), EPA proposedto approve certain control measures in the 1987 Maricopa CO plan; however,those measures did not by themselves provide sufficient emission reductionsto demonstrate timely attainment of the CO standard in Maricopa County.In response to the plan's failure to demonstrate timely attainment andto an order by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, EPAalso proposed in the same notice to promulgate a federal implementationplan (FIP) for Maricopa County. This proposed FIP contained two measures_anoxygenated fuels program for motor vehicles and an employer-based tripreduction program_which together with the proposed SIP measures would haveprovided sufficient emission reductions to demonstrate attainment by December31, 1991. As fully discussed in the May 16 proposal and later in this notice,EPA believes that the December 31, 1991 date is the latest date by whichan approvable Arizona SIP may demonstrate attainment under the Clean AirAct and EPA's own policies in light of the possibility of attainment bythen without the use of draconian measures.In June, 1988, the Arizona State Legislature passed House Bill 2206 whichcontains a state-run oxygenated fuels program, a travel reduction program,a loaded-mode testing requirement for the State's inspection and maintenance(I/M) program, and other measures. Two of those measures, the loaded-modeI/M test requirement and the voluntary no-drive-day program apply to bothMaricopa and Pima Counties. On July 18 and 22, 1988, the State submittedportions of H.B. 2206 and a persuasive demonstration that the measuresin the bill along with the SIP measures proposed for emission reductioncredit by EPA on May 16 will lead to attainment of the CO standards inMaricopa by December 31, 1991. In its May 16 notice, EPA had proposed inadvance to approve the measures similar to those in H.B. 2206 if the Stateadopted and submitted them to EPA prior to August 10, 1988. Today, EPAtakes final action to approve the SIP Submittals received by EPA on October5, 1987, and July 18 and 22, 1988. EPA takes this action based on its conclusionthat the control measures and the attainment demonstration fully meet therequirements of section 110 and Part D of the Clean Air Act (CAA or theAct). EPA is also taking final action to approve the Maricopa County NewSource Review (NSR) regulations proposed for approval on July 3, 1983 (48FR 34293).With its full approval of the Maricopa SIP, EPA is withdrawing its proposedFIP and the proposal to impose highway funding restrictions under CAA section176(a) which were proposed on May 16, 1988. In addition, EPA is lifting,effective today, the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban on major newor modified sources of CO that it imposed on September 23, 1986 (51 FR33746).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 10, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the submitted SIP revisions and EPA's technicalsupport document (TSD) for this rulemaking are available for public inspectionduring normal working hours at the following addresses:<ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, State Liaison Section,A-2-2, Air Management Division, 215 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA 94105</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Air Quality,2005 N.

Background</ITAG>The CAA amendments of 1977 required States to revise their SIPs by certaintimes for all areas that had not then attained the National Ambient AirQuality Standards (NAAQS). Generally, the States containing these designated``nonattainment areas'' had to submit revised SIPs by January 1, 1979.The 1979 SIP revisions were to provide for attainment of the NAAQS by December31, 1982. An extension of the attainment date for ozone or CO to no laterthan December 31, 1987, was available under section 172 if the State coulddemonstrate as part of its 1979 SIP revision that attainment by the endof 1982 was not possible, despite the implementation of all reasonablyavailable control measures. For areas that received an attainment dateextension from EPA, States were required to submit to EPA by July 1, 1982,an additional SIP revision that provided for attainment no later than December31, 1987, and that complied with all other requirements of Part D of theCAA.A. Maricopa SIP DisapprovalMaricopa County was designated as nonattainment for CO on March 3, 1978(43 FR 8970), and the State submitted Maricopa County's initial nonattainmentarea plan for CO in 1979 and 1980. On October 30, 1980, the State submitteda request to EPA to extend the CO attainment date in Maricopa County toDecember 31, 1987. EPA proposed to approve the extension request on February5, 1982 (47 FR 5439).On May 5, 1982 (47 FR 19826), EPA took final action to approve the 1979SIP revision on the condition that the State submit revised regulationsfor Maricopa County to meet the Act's NSR requirements. On June 3, 1982,and March 4, 1983, the State submitted NSR regulations for Maricopa County.On July 3, 1983 (48 FR 34293), EPA proposed to approve the Maricopa NSRrules with one exception and certain understandings.Beyond establishing the NSR condition, EPA, in its final action on the1979 CO plan, found that the plan was not adequate to bring about attainmentby the end of 1982. EPA premised its limited approval of the plan on theexpectation that (1) the Agency would take final action to grant the State'srequest for an attainment date extension to December 31, 1987, and (2)the State would submit another plan revision which would provide for attainmentby that date. The State submitted a plan purporting to meet this requirementon October 26, 1982.On January 27, 1986 (51 FR 3343), EPA proposed to disapprove the revisedMaricopa plan and impose the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban becausethe State had not adequately demonstrated that the plan would provide fortimely attainment of the standard.On September 23, 1986 (51 FR 33746), EPA published a final notice disapprovingthe CO plans for both the Maricopa and Pima Counties nonattainment areasand imposing the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban on major new sourcesand major modifications to existing sources of CO in the two areas. Asexplained fully in the September 23, 1986 notice, EPA determined that itwas not necessary to take final action on the State's attainment date extensionrequest.B. U.S. District Court OrderOn August 10, 1987, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizonaordered EPA to promulgate a FIP under section 110(c) of the Act for COin the Maricopa and Pima Counties nonattainment areas. The Court foundthat EPA's duty to promulgate a FIP arose when EPA found the State planswere inadequate. The Court Order is the result of a citizen suit broughtagainst EPA on April 8, 1985, by the Arizona Center for Law in the PublicInterest (ACLPI). The timeframe specified in the Court Order for EPA topromulgate a FIP was six months following either the formal submittal ofthe Pima CO plan or September 30, 1987, whichever came first. <T3>McCarthy </T3>v. <T3>Thomas, </T3>D. Ariz. No. CIV-85-34-TUC-1WDB (slip op., Aug. 10, 1987).The Court left open the possibility that EPA could file a motion afterJanuary 1, 1988, requesting an extension of the time period for FIP promulgationif necessary.On March 14, 1988, EPA moved the Court to extend the period for EPA topromulgate a FIP for the Maricopa and Pima areas. On April 19, 1988, theCourt issued an Order requiring EPA to propose a FIP for Maricopa Countyno later than May 13, 1988, hold public hearings on the proposal no laterthan June 10, 1988, close the public comment period following the hearingby July 11, 1988, and promulgate a FIP for Maricopa County no later thanAugust 10, 1988. The Court also ordered that the same schedule for FIPpromulgation shall apply for Pima County if EPA did not accept the PimaCounty SIP. On July 19, 1988, EPA moved the Court to amend its Order tospecifically allow EPA to approve Arizona's SIP for Maricopa County byAugust 10, 1988. The Court granted EPA's motion on July 20, 1988.EPA outlined its intended approach to comply with the Court Order to promulgatea FIP for Maricopa and Pima Counties in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking(ANPRM) (51 FR 45466) published on November 30, 1987. In the ANPRM, EPAexplained that, to promulgate a FIP for these two areas, EPA must selectcontrol measures that fill whatever gaps are left by approved portionsof the State plans. The ANPRM also discussed the Maricopa County CO planthat had been submitted as a SIP revision by the State on October 5, 1987.The plan indicated that the area could attain the CO standard as earlyas 1990 and in any event by 1995 if the recommended control strategy inthe SIP (including an oxygenated fuels program for motor vehicles, winterdaylight, savings time, and an employer-based trip reduction ordinance)were fully adopted and implemented.The Maricopa plan claimed credit, both implicitly and explicitly, for theArizona vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program as expanded through1987. On April 26, 1988, in a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice on the revised Pima CO plan, EPA proposedto approve the improvements to the State's I/M program as adopted by theArizona State Legislature in 1985, 1986, and 1987. (51 FR 14818). The revisedMaricopa plan also assumed credit for the following additional controlmeasures: Transit and ridesharing improvements, expanded facilities toencourage increased pedestrian and bicycle trips, alternative work hours,alternative fuels for vehicle fleets, alternative-fueled transit vehiclepurchase, and a voluntary no-drive-day program. On May 16, 1988 (53 FR17379), EPA proposed to approve and assign emissions reduction creditsto all of these measures except for the alternative fuels for vehicle fleetsand the voluntary no-drive-day program. However, the creditable measuresin the revised plan did not by themselves provide sufficient emissionsreductions to demonstrate attainment of the CO standard. Therefore, EPAalso proposed to promulgate the two control measures for Maricopa Countyidentified in the ANPRM_an oxygenated fuels program and an employer-basedtrip reduction program_as technologically available elements of a FIP thatwould provide the emission reductions necessary for attainment.C. Proposed FIPAs fully described in the May 16, 1988 notice, EPA's evaluation of theair quality modeling analysis in the SIP submittal prepared by the MaricopaAssociation of Governments (MAG) shows that a 22.0 percent reduction inthe 1991 baseline CO emissions is needed to demonstrate attainment of the8-hour CO standard by December 31, 1991. (The applicable attainment datefor the Maricopa plan is described in detail in the proposed rulemakingand is summarized later in this notice.) The MAG plan provided an approvableemission reduction of 3.9 percent by the end of 1991 leaving a shortfallof 18.1 percent in the emission reductions needed for attainment. To fillthat shortfall, EPA proposed two federal control measures_an employer alternativemodes incentives program and an oxygenated fuels program_which, togetherwith the approvable SIP measures, would provide at least a 22.0 percentreduction in CO emissions by the end of 1991.The proposed oxygenated fuels program required an equivalent oxygen contentlevel of 2.57 percent in motor vehicle fuels sold in the Maricopa areain the winter CO season: October 1 through March 31. Oxygenated fuel blends,in the form of aliphatic alcohols and/or ethers which are currently onthe market and available to the Maricopa area, include methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether(MTBE), ethanol (gasohol) and methanol/cosolvent blends. The effect ofthese blends in gasoline is to cause motor vehicle engines to run leanerthereby reducing emissions of carbon monoxide. In the May 16, 1988 notice,EPA noted that the equivalent oxygen content requirement could change inthe final rulemaking depending upon the combination of control measuresselected for promulgation and on whether the State adopted any additionalcontrol measures. EPA also solicited comments on whether the proposed tripreduction regulation should be replaced by a higher average oxygen contentlevel in the oxygenated fuels program.The proposed employer alternative modes incentive program required thateach employer of 100 or more employees at a worksite in the nonattainmentarea develop and offer to its employees alternative transportation modeincentives. These incentives would be designed to reduce the number ofsingle-occupant-vehicle (SOV) commute trips to the employer's worksite.The proposed trip reduction goal was a 5 percent reduction in SOV commutetrips in the first year and an additional 5 percent in the second year.EPA`s proposed program was designed to regulate the same group of employersat the same trip reduction level as the MAG model trip reduction ordinance(described fully in the May 16, 1988 notice). EPA estimated that the MAGmodel or EPA's proposed regulation, if fully implemented, could reduceCO emissions by 1.8 percent by the end of 1991.In the May 16, 1988 proposal, EPA recognized the possibility that Arizonawould adopt and submit as a SIP revision additional CO control measuresprior to final promulgation by EPA of the proposed FIP measures. EPA proposedto modify the final FIP if additional controls were submitted and EPA determinedthat they were approvable for CO emission reduction credit. The purposeof the modification would be to rely as much as possible on State controlsrather than federal controls and to promulgate only as much federal controlas needed to satisfy the Act's attainment date requirements. EPA proposedthat if the revised SIP achieved 22.0 percent or more emission reductions,and EPA approved it, EPA would not promulgate any FIP.EPA noted that the Arizona State Legislature was considering several billsthat would establish oxygenated fuels programs in Maricopa County and wasproposing legislation to improve the State I/M program through the additionof a loaded-mode testing requirement and to require a trip reduction programin Maricopa County. In its proposed notice, EPA evaluated the various carbonmonoxide control measures then under consideration by the Arizona StateLegislature and indicated which measures EPA would approve if adopted andsubmitted as SIP revisions.The May 16, 1988 proposal provided that if a legally enforceable trip reductionordance was adopted by the State, County, or local governments which wassubstantially equivalent to the MAG model ordinance and the proposed federaltrip reduction regulation and which covered all or virtually all employersof more than 100 persons in the CO nonattainment area, then EPA would notfinalize its own trip reduction regulation. The notice also stated thatEPA might go directly to final approval of the loaded-mode I/M testingrequirement then being considered by the Arizona Legislature. Finally,in order to lay the procedural foundation for EPA to take action on anynew oxygenated fuels legislation with as little delay as possible, EPAproposed the methods and assumptions that it would use in approving ordisapproving such new legislation and in assigning CO emission reductioncredit to it.D. Dates for Attainment and Maintenance of the CO StandardThe May 16, 1988 notice describes in detail the legal requirements applicableto any FIP that EPA would promulgate for the Maricopa area, in light ofits unique characteristics. In general those requirements would also applyto any SIP submitted for the area. Specifically, EPA concluded that theFIP, as well as any SIP approved by EPA, must meet the requirements ofboth section 110 and Part D of the CAA. EPA also interpreted those requirementsto determine how they apply to implementation plans for this area afterDecember 31, 1987, the latest attainment date expressly identified in theCAA. That date is the planning date for areas that received EPA's approvalof an extension beyond the otherwise applicable planning date: December31, 1982. See section 172(a). The Maricopa area has not received EPA'sapproval of such an extension. However, since the later date, December31, 1987, has now elapsed as well, the discussion below analyzes both datessimilarly_as elapsed Part D dates.As explained in EPA's policy on post-1987 attainment planning proposedon November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45044), since it will be physically impossibleafter 1987 for EPA to plan for these areas to attain by the elapsed datesin Part D, EPA intends to interpret the requirement to plan for attainmentby those dates as a legal impossibility. EPA believes that Congress wouldhave intended EPA in such circumstances to select, in place of the elapseddates, a subsequent date consistent with the general principles of theCAA and Part D. <T3>See Chevron, U.S.A. v. N.R.D.C.,</T3> 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Although it is not clear what subsequent date Congress would have intendedin these circumstances, the history of the CAA's planning requirementssuggests that Congress would have provided EPA (and these areas) an additionalperiod analogous to the 3- and 5-year periods set forth in section 110(a)(2)(A)and section 110(e), respectively. When Congress in 1977 directed EPA toinitiate a new round of planning for areas that have failed earlier toproduce adequate plans meeting the section 110 requirements, it creatednew planning periods comparable to the section 110 periods (3/5 years fromEPA's approval of the state plan), rather than shortening those periodsand thereby demanding plans for immediate attainment. Section 172(a)(1)required the SIPs for non-extension areas to provide for attainment bythe end of 1982, four years from the date these submittals were due (January1, 1979) (See section 129(c)). To be sure, Congress provided a much longerattainment period for extension areas: From January 1, 1979 to December31, 1987, approximately nine years from the date the initial Part D SIPswere due. But it set up two planning periods for these areas_one to applyall ``reasonably available'' measures and a second to supplement thosemeasures. Since most reasonably available measures should already havebeen implemented in the Maricopa area by now, EPA regards post-1987 planningfor the area as comparable to the planning during the second Part D period.That period spanned from the July 1982 submittal date (see section 129(c))to the end of 1987, a period roughly consistent with the 3- and 5-yearperiods in section 110. Thus, although sections 110(a)(2) and (e) do notliterally apply to the Maricopa area, EPA will use them (absent considerationsof impossibility) as the best indicators of the attainment periods Congresswould have intended to apply to plans for these areas after passage ofthe Part D dates.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Certain important qualifications apply to this analysis.First, EPA is here dealing with a situation in which attainment within3 years is a practical possibility given the size of the nonattainmentproblem and the measures that the state has submitted. EPA currently hasrulemaking and policy proposals outstanding which raise the question ofwhether EPA must disapprove a SIP, and thereby trigger a construction ban,even where a state has failed to submit measures that would provide forattainment within 3 or 5 years <T3>and</T3> where attainment by means of any measures would be impossibleas a practical matter. See 52 FR 26404 (July 14, 1987 and 52 FR 45044 (November24, 1987). Thus EPA has yet to decide in final form what the role of impossibilityis under the Act for the purpose of approval or disapproval of SIPs.<ITAG tagnum="28">Second, EPA is not deciding in this notice of final action what itsobligations under section 110(c) to promulgate a federal implementationplan are. Again, the role of the doctrine of impossibility is uncertain.Further, it is uncertain in any event that EPA must promulgate a FIP thatprovides for attainment by a near-term fixed date. EPA currently is exploringthese issues in connection with the ozone and CO SIPs for certain areasin California, including the South Coast Air Quality Management District.EPA does not intend by means of the discussion and analysis in this noticeto express a final view on these issues.</ITAG>Section 110(a)(2) requires implementation plans to provide for attainmentas expeditiously as practicable but no later than 3 years from EPA's approvalof an adequate plan. Section 110(e) allows the EPA Administrator to granta 2-year extension of the attainment date (beyond the 3-year period insection 110(a)(2)(A)) only if:(A) One or more emission sources (or classes of moving sources) are unableto comply with the requirements of such plans which implement such primarystandard because the necessary technology or other alternatives are notavailable or will not be available soon enough to permit compliance withinsuch 3-year period, and(B) The State has considered and applied as a part of its plan reasonablyavailable alternative means of attaining such primary standard and hasjustifiably concluded that attainment of such primary standard within the3 years cannot be achieved.Applying these attainment deadlines to the Maricopa area, the plan mustdemonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but in no case laterthan 1991 (assuming plan approval in 1988), unless even with the applicationof reasonably available alternative means attainment cannot be achievedwithin that period. For the reasons described below and later in this notice,EPA is approving the State's plan for the Maricopa area which now includestwo creditable measures originally proposed as FIP measures_an employer-basedtrip reduction program and an oxygenated fuels program_and an additionalcreditable measure, loaded-mode I/M testing, that will bring about attainmentof the CO standard by December 31, 1991 in the area.EPA believes that a trip reduction program, an oxygenated fuels program,and a loaded-mode I/M testing program are technologically available measuresthat would produce enough emissions reductions in combination to bringabout attainment by December 31, 1991. However, EPA does not believe thatany combination of available, practicable measures exists which could providefor attainment in the Maricopa area before the end of 1991. It is truethat a very stringent oxygenated fuels program could theoretically advancethe attainment date to 1990, but EPA cannot now conclude that any oxygenatedfuels program is definitely practicable for application in the Maricopaarea due to numerous outstanding questions concerning market penetration,fuel availability, compliance monitoring, and consumer reaction to sucha program. EPA is approving the oxygenated fuels program described lateronly because it is necessary to provide for attainment by end of 1991.Consequently, EPA does not believe that any practicable measures existwhich could achieve attainment in the Maricopa area before the end of 1991.On the other hand, EPA can also not make the conclusion, necessary to supporta two-year attainment date extension under section 110(e), that a tripreduction program, an oxygenated fuels program and a loaded-mode I/M testingrequirement are clearly not reasonably available alternatives measures.Oxygenated fuels are technologically available and EPA believes that, althoughthere are numerous and significant outstanding questions concerning theprogram, they may well not prove to be significant obstacles to successfulimplementation of the program. Similarly, a trip reduction program is inplace in some California localities and thus, despite potential employerresistance, it appears reasonably available for the Phoenix area as well.Finally, the loaded-mode testing requirement also appears reasonably availablefor Phoenix.Therefore, EPA is approving a trip reduction program, an oxygenated fuelsprogram, and a loaded-mode I/M testing requirement for the Maricopa areabecause the programs are technologically available measures that are necessaryto bring the area into attainment by the end of 1991. And, beyond that,as proposed, EPA does not believe it is appropriate to invoke the two-yearextension provided in section 110(e).EPA's approval of the SIP for Maricopa is consistent with outstanding agencyguidance on CO SIP preparation. In an April 4, 1979 notice (44 FR 20372),EPA published criteria for approval of the Part D SIP revisions that theAct required states to submit in 1979. On January 22, 1981 (46 FR 7182),EPA published criteria for evaluating the supplemental SIP revisions forextension areas due in mid-1982.Section 110(a)(2) requires a plan to provide not only for timely attainmentof the NAAQS but also for maintenance of the standards thereafter. TheSIP for the Maricopa area is based on the modeling and emission projectionsprepared by MAG as part of its SIP submittal. The MAP plan projects emissionsonly through 1995; however, the projections demonstrate that the proposedSIP will continue to provide for maintenance of the CO NAAQS at least through1995. EPA's proposed policy on post-1987 planning would require post-1987SIPs to include a demonstration of maintenance for a period of ten yearsfollowing the time of SIP submittal. As applied to the Maricopa SIP, itwould require a maintenance demonstration through 1998. Based on availabledata and its own projections based on the MAG plan, EPA concludes thatwith the SIP approved today the Maricopa area will attain and maintainthe CO NAAQS through at least 1998. EPA recognizes that the phase- outof the CO reduction benefits of the Federal Motor Vehicle Emission ControlProgram and population growth and associated increases in vehicle milestraveled may cause CO levels to rise in the Maricopa area in the late 1990s.EPA will continue to gather the necessary data to monitor the continuingvalidity of this maintenance determination beyond 1995.E. Lifting of Construction Ban and Withdrawal of Proposed 176(a) SanctionsSection 110(a)(2)(I) of the CAA and EPA's regulation at 40 CFR 52.24 imposea ban on the construction of major new or modified stationary sources ofCO until such time as a state plan meeting the requirements of Part D isapproved by the Administrator. Accordingly, EPA imposed the constructionban upon disapproval of the SIP on September 23, 1986. Since EPA has nowdetermined that the SIP submitted by Arizona meets the requirements ofsection 110 and Part D of the CAA and will result in attainment of theCO standard as expeditiously as practicable in 1991, EPA is taking finalaction to approve the SIP for Maricopa County and lift the constructionban originally imposed on September 23, 1986.In the May 16, 1988 notice, EPA proposed that, if Arizona did not supplementthe Maricopa plan with the measures to demonstrate expeditious attainment,EPA would make a final finding that the State is not making reasonableefforts to submit an adequate Part D plan and, upon making such a finalfinding, would impose the federal highway finding restriction of section176(a). Since Arizona has submitted additional CO control measures whichEPA has determined meet the requirements of Part D of the CAA, EPA canno longer make this finding and therefore withdraws its proposal on thisissue.F. Finding under Section 211(c)(4)(C)EPA believes that Arizona is authorized under the Clean Air Act to prescribeand enforce the oxygenated fuels program EPA is approving today. As fullyexplained in the May 16, 1988 NPRM at 17412-3, EPA interprets section 211(c)(4)(A)to allow state regulation of motor vehicle fuels or fuel additives unlessthere has been federal pre-emption. Under section 211(c)(4)(A) pre-emptionof state regulation of a fuel occurs (i) if EPA has found that no fuel-relatedcontrol or prohibition is necessary for that fuel or additive and has publishedsuch finding in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>or (ii) if EPA has prescribed by regulationunder section 211(c)(i) a control or prohibition applicable to the fuelor fuel-additive regulated by the state that is different from the statecontrol or prohibition. The Agency wants to stress that it does not believethat either form of pre-emption has occurred in this case.First, EPA has not made the finding that no fuel-related control or prohibitionis necessary and clearly has not published any such finding in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Second, EPA does not believe that it has prescribed the type of fuel controlcontemplated in section 211(c)(4)(A)(ii). EPA believes the reference inthat section to ``a control or prohibition applicable to such fuel or fueladditive'' prescribed by the Administrator was intended to include onlythe same type of fuel control that the regulation in question is attemptingto prescribe. Under this approach, section 211(c)(4)(A)'s prohibition ofthe adoption of a particular type of fuel control would be triggered onlyif EPA had already prescribed, by regulation under section 211(c)(1), thesame type of fuel control as at issue in the case at hand_in this casecontrols on the oxygen content of fuels. Since EPA has not prescribed anycontrol on the oxygen content of any fuel by section 211(c) rulemaking,\2\<NOTE/> the Agency believes that the pre-emption described in section211(c)(4)(A)(ii) has not occurred. As a result, Arizona is free to adoptits own oxygen content controls and EPA is free to approve a SIP whichincludes such controls. Under these circumstances, EPA may approve suchcontrols without making the special finding described in section 211(c)(4)(C)of the Act. Section 211(c)(4)(C) allows, where pre-emption has occurred,state fuel-related controls to be approved into a SIP if EPA finds suchcontrols are ``necessary'' to achieve the standard the SIP implements.In this case a finding under section 211(c)(4)(C) is not required becausepre-emption has not occurred. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ EPA has estimated limits on oxygen content for certainnew fuels that have been granted waivers under section 211(f) of the Actfor introduction into commerce, but has taken no such action under section211(c). Even if pre-emption has occurred, however, EPA believes that it may stillapprove certain types of state provisions for limits on oxygen contentbecause the Agency can make the finding under section 211(c)(4)(C), whichwould authorize approval and, thus, eliminate the pre-emption problem.In the May 16, 1988 notice, EPA proposed to make such a finding as to provisionsconcerning oxygen content and today makes this finding final as to theoxygenated-fuel provisions in H.B. 2206. Section 211(c)(4)(C) authorizesEPA to approve into a SIP a state-adopted fuel control measure that hasotherwise been pre-empted by EPA action, if EPA finds that the state control``is necessary to achieve the standard'' that the SIP implements. As explainedin the May 16, 1988 proposal, EPA interprets the language to require theAgency to find that the fuel control requirement is essential to achievetimely attainment of the standard. EPA believes that a fuel control measuremay be ``necessary'' for timely attainment if no other measures that wouldbring about timely attainment exist, or if such other measures exist andare technically possible to implement, but are unreasonable or impracticable.As explained in the proposal at 17413, EPA believes that reductions achievableby an oxygenated fuels program are essential to bring about timely attainmentin the Maricopa CO nonattainment area, because no other measures shortof severe draconian controls are available to achieve attainment by theend of 1991. Short of such severe alternatives, only an oxygenated fuelsprogram, supplemented by other measures like loaded-mode I/M testing andtravel reduction ordinances, can provide the 22 percent CO reduction necessaryfor attainment in 1991 without unacceptable socioeconomic impacts. In orderto lay the procedural foundation for final approval of new legislation,EPA listed several conditions or restrictions on its proposed finding thatan oxygenated fuels program is ``necessary'' within the meaning of section211(c)(4)(C). EPA believes that H.B. 2206 meets those conditions. At proposalthe Agency indicated that some of the bills then before the Arizona legislaturecontained elements that exceeded the requirements for timely attainment.EPA then solicited comment on whether, if some elements in the final legislationexceeded the minimum program necessary for timely attainment, the Agencyshould treat those elements as separable from the remainder of the programand withhold the ``necessity'' finding for them. 53 FR 17413-17414.EPA has examined H.B. 2206 and believes that two elements of the legislation,if viewed in isolation from the remainder, arguably require reductionsbeyond the minimum that would produce timely attainment. First, the averagingrequirement of section 41-2124 might, if triggered, produce more CO reductionin the January through March period than is strictly needed for timelyattainment. Second, the set-aside authority of sections 78-2071 through78-2708 might, if exercised, make it possible for more fuel to be blendedto higher oxygen levels than might otherwise be the case.In light of the process that led to the State's enactment of H.B. 2206,however, EPA has concluded that these two elements must be viewed as integralparts of the legislation adopted by Arizona and that, because the legislationconsists primarily of elements essential to timely attainment, EPA shouldfind the legislation as a whole ``necessary'' to achieve the CO standard.A review of the legislative activity leading to the enactment of the lawdemonstrates that the final legislation reflects a balance aimed at assuringthe widest possible availability of alternative types of oxygenated fuelsin the Maricopa County petroleum market. In fact, the Agency believes thata primary reason that the legislature successfully formulated the necessaryoxygenated fuels program is that it was able to reach a consensus ensuringthe introduction of a significant amount of fuels with alcohol into thearea. Because both of the program elements described above appear to havebeen adopted for the purpose of meeting this alcohol-related goal, andsince that goal itself seems to have been critical to enactment of thelegislation as a whole, EPA believes it would be inappropriate to concludethat those elements were not themselves ``necessary'' to achieve the standard,within the meaning of section 211(a)(4)(C).\3\<NOTE/> Indeed, to withhold the ``necessity'' finding from thosetwo elements would reflect a misunderstanding of the process that led tothe enactment of H.B. 2206. For these reasons, EPA finds that the oxygenatedfuels program as a whole contained in H.B. 2206 is ``necessary to achieveattainment'' of the CO standard in the Maricopa nonattainment area.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Agency might have concluded otherwise if the billhad consisted primarily of elements not technically necessary for attainment,but H.B. 2206 is not that case.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Evaluation of State SIP Submittals  </ITAG>On October 5, 1987, the State of Arizona submitted the MAG 1987 CarbonMonoxide Plan for the Maricopa County Area and parts of Arizona SenateBill 1360 as revisions to the SIP. On May 16, 1988, EPA explicitly proposedto assign specific emission reduction credits to several of the measuresin the plan and the bill. EPA also proposed to approve the resolutionsof commitment in the SIP to implement control measures which were passedby the jurisdictions in Maricopa County as well as other State and localagencies.  On July 18, 1988, the State submitted portions of Arizona H.B. 2206 andon July 22, 1988, the State submitted additional portions of H.B. 2206as well as a demonstration that the measures in the 1987 SIP submittalcombined with measures in the new submittals provide for attainment ofthe CO standard in Maricopa County by the end of 1991. Also accompanyingthe July 22, 1988 SIP submittal were workplans from agencies having responsibilityfor implementing parts of H.B. 2206. These workplans express each agency'sintent to carry out the legislation and are included in the technical supportdocument (TSD) for this notice.  Immediately following is a more detailed evaluation of the measures inthe SIP submittals.

Control Measure Evaluation <ITAG tagnum="81">Measures in the 1987 SIP Submittal </ITAG>The MAG recommended a list of 45 transportation and mobile source controlmeasures for inclusion in its final carbon monoxide plan. These measuresincluded expansion of the I/M program boundaries, improvements to transitand ridesharing programs, trip reduction ordinances, public awareness programs,a voluntary no-drive-day program, parking management, high-occupancy-vehicle(HOV) facilities, traffic flow improvements, pedestrian and bicycle travelamenities, alternative fuels, alternative work hours, changes in land usepolicies, winter daylight savings time, and miscellaneous other measures.A complete list of these measures can be found in the TSD.In 1987, the Arizona State Legislature passed S.B. 1360. This legislationrequired, among other things, enhancements to the State I/M program, alternativeworkhours for public employees, and purchase of only clean-fuel buses bypublic agencies after January 1990. Emission reduction credits for thesemeasures were taken in the MAG plan. The State submitted the final MAG CO plan and S.B. 1360 to EPA as revisionsto the Arizona CO SIP on October 5, 1987. Included in this SIP submittalare resolutions passed by the MAG member jurisdictions that contained commitmentsto implement measures in the MAG plan. Resolutions or letters of commitmentsare also included from the MAG Regional Council, the Phoenix MetropolitionChamber of Commerce, the Regional Public Transportation Authoirty (RPTA),the Arizona Department of Transportation, and the two local Air Force Bases.EPA is taking action today to incorporate these resolutions as part ofthe Maricopa SIP.From its review of the specific commitments in the plan as well as actionsof the State Legislature, EPA proposed on May 16, 1988 to credit nine measuresas part of the Arizona SIP. These measures are the I/M program enhancementsin S.B. 1360,\4\<NOTE/> short-range transit improvements, expanded ridesharing, HOVlanes, freeway flow improvements, increased bicycle and pedestrian travel,conversion of buses to alternative fuels, and alternative workhours. EPAtoday is taking action to grant these measures the emission reduction creditslisted in Table 1. More detailed information on EPA's reasoning for andthe State's commitments to each of these measures is discussed in the TSD.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ EPA is taking final action to approve these provisionsin its final action on the Pima CO SIP elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The cities, towns, and the County of Maricopa also made commitments toother measures (for example: Traffic flow improvements, educational programs,and city/county employee programs) that will contribute to reductions inambient carbon monoxide concentrations. Unfortunately, due to the natureof many of these measures and their often very small emission reductions,specific emission reduction estimates were impossible to calculate. Whilenot granting specific emission reduction credits for these measures, EPAis today incorporating these commitments into the Maricopa SIP. <ITAG tagnum="81">Measures in the 1988 SIP Submittals </ITAG>In June of this year, the State Legislature passed H.B. 2206. This billcontains the authority or requirements for an oxygenated fuels program,loaded-mode I/M testing, a voluntary no-drive-day program in both Pimaand Maricopa Counties, and a travel reduction program in Maricopa Countyonly. On July 18 and 22, 1988, the State submitted portions of the adoptedbill to EPA as a revision to both the Maricopa and Pima portions of theArizona CO SIP. Accompanying the July 22 SIP submittal were workplans fromeach of the agencies charged with implementing a program or part of a programunder H.B. 2206. These workplans clarify each agency's responsibilitiesand intents on implementing the provisions of the bill and are includedas attachments to the TSD. Below is a short description of each of thecontrol measures in H.B. 2206. <T3>1. Oxygenated Fuels Program. </T3>H.B. 2206 establishes an oxygenatedfuels program for the CO nonattainment area of Maricopa County. New Section41-2123 A, Arizona Revised Statutes, sets the required oxygen content ofleaded fuel at 2.4 to 3.7 percent by weight. Unleaded fuel is prohibitedfrom containing less than 1.9 percent oxygen or more oxygen than allowedby the provisions of an EPA waiver under section 211(f) of the CAA, i.e.,currently a maximum of 3.7 percent. These restrictions apply from and afterSeptember 30 of one year through March 31 of the next year, beginning inthe fall of 1989. Section 41-2123 B provides that if the Sun Refining andMarketing Company's request for a waiver for 15 percent by volume MTBEin unleaded gasoline (53 FR 11701 (April 8, 1988) is approved by EPA, theoxygen limits will instead be 2.3 to 3.7 percent for both leaded and unleadedgasoline. New section 41-2124 directs the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT)to enforce a higher oxygen content requirement from January 1 through March31, if marketing data for the preceding October and November indicate thatless than 10 percent of fuel sold contained 3.2 to 3.7 percent oxygen.The higher oxygen requirement would be enforced through averaging overthe three month period. The oxygen requirement is to be set by ADOT toensure that 18 percent of all fuel sold contains between 3.2 and 3.7 percentoxygen. The averaging requirement apparently would not supersede the requirementthat each quantity of fuel sold also meet the required minimum and maximumoxygen limits in section 41-2123 A or B. New sections 28-2701 through 28-2708 establish authority for the Governorto implement a set-aside program that effectively insures the availabilityof gasoline suitable for blending with alcohol, if the ADOT determinesa shortage of such unblended gasoline exists during the mandatory oxygenatedfuels period. Only the requirements of section 41-2123 A and B can be credited with COemission reductions. The averaging requirement of section 41-2124 would,if triggered, produce additional CO reduction but only in the January throughMarch period. However, EPA has no assurance that this requirement wouldin fact be triggered. The set-aside authority of sections 28-2071 through28-2708 would, if exercised, make it possible for more fuel to be blendedto higher oxygen levels associated with alcohol-based blends than mightotherwise be the case with other gasoline blends. The Governor has thediscretionary authority, however, to declare a shortage and order the set-asideprogram into operation. Even if ordered, EPA has received no informationwith which to estimate the degree of alcohol blending during the entirecompliance period, as discussed later in this section.Before presenting EPA's analysis of the Maricopa County program, it shouldbe noted that a detailed description of oxygenated fuels and their effecton motor vehicle emissions is contained in EPA's NPRM of May 16, 1988 (58FR 17378). Also, the overall methodology and assumptions for evaluatingthe CO effects of the oxygen content limits specified in section 41-2123A or B were proposed at 17410 of that same <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice and clarified by a memo from Phil Lorang,Office of Mobile Sources, EPA, to Wallace Woo, EPA Region 9 (June 22, 1988).The details of the methodology are contained in the TSD for this actionand will not be repeated here. The interested reader is instead referredto that document. However, the basic elements of EPA's evaluation are brieflydescribed below. The EPA report, ``Guidance on Estimating Motor Vehicle Emission ReductionsFrom the Use of Alternative Fuels and Fuel Blends,'' January 29, 1988,EPA -AA-TSS-PA-87-4, is the basis for the calculation of CO emission reductions.The guidance in this report is supplemented with the following informationand assumptions, which pertain to the specific program contained in H.B.2206. In response to the mandate which specifies different oxygen levels forspecific grades of gasoline, EPA assumes that catalyst vehicles will useunleaded gasoline and that vehicles manufactured without a catalyst willuse leaded fuel with an allowance for the voluntary use of unleaded fuel.EPA also assumes that, in the near term, no switching between leaded andunleaded gasoline will occur due to changes in relative price or consumerdesire to use or avoid one type or level of oxygenate. Regarding the actualoxyen content, EPA assumes that the minimum oxygen content for all gradesof gasoline will be met using MTBE with a 0.1 percent oxygen safety margin.\5\<NOTE/> This assumption is based on a workplan for implementationof H.B. 2206 contained in Appendix B.2 of the SIP Addendum which indicatesan intent by the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures (ADWM) to allowno enforcement tolerance for oxygen content so that refiners must blendto a slightly higher oxygen level to allow for measurement variability.Additionally, no major oil company, other sizable gasoline marketer, orother investor indicated in comments on EPA's NPRM that it will definitelypurchase and import via pipeline from California oxygen-free gasoline forresale to distributors for use in alcohol blending. Thus, EPA is conservativelyassuming that no alcohol blends will be sold in the Phoenix area for thepurposes of assigning emission reduction credits to the program. Therefore,if the Sun waiver is not approved, leaded fuel is expected to contain alevel of MTBE which produces 2.5 percent oxygen content by weight and unleadedfuel is expected to contain a level of MTBE which  produces 2.0 percentoxygen by weight. If the Sun waiver is approved, EPA assumes that all fuelwill contain a level of MTBE which produces 2.4 percent oxygen by weight,i.e., about 13.2 percent MTBE by volume depending on the density of individualbatches of gasoline used in blending. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ EPA originally assumed leaded fuel would be blended withethanol blends. However, the ``substantially similar'' restriction of section211 of the Clean Air Act does not apply to leaded fuel, so MTBE can legallybe used at any levels. The Agency finds the current MTBE assumption ismore realistic and more conservative regarding emission benefits. See theTSD for details.With respect to enforcement of the State's program, as noted above, theADWM has developed a workplan for implementation of H.B. 2206 which containsenforcement provisions. Further, H.B. 2206 appropriates resources to theDepartment for this purpose. Given the information and assumptions delineated above, the fleet averageCO emission reduction would be 14.28 percent on December 31, 1991 if theSun waiver is not approved. If the waiver is approved, the CO reductionwould be 16.20 percent on that date. The actual CO reduction in Maricopa County may be higher, but not assuredlyso. If a 10 percent market share for alcohol blends is in fact achievedthroughout the six-month mandate period, the 3.4 to 3.7 percent oxygencontent by weight normally associated with such fuel would provide greaterCO benefits than the smaller values assumed by EPA for MTBE blends. Forexample, if the Sun waiver is approved and a 10 percent alcohol blend marketshare actually occurs throughout the six-month period, the fleet CO reductionin December 1991 would be 16.7 percent. However, EPA has no evidence thatthis will in fact occur for the entire compliance period, so this estimateis provided for illustration only, and is not part of the basis for SIPapproval. <T3>2. Loaded-Mode Inspection and Maintenance Testing. </T3>Currently theArizona I/M program passes or fails vehicles based on their exhaust emissionconcentrations under curb-idle conditions. Section 18 of H.B. 2206 amendsSection 49-542 F of the Arizona Revised Statutes, to require, beginningon January 1, 1989, that 1981 and newer vehicles pass both a curb-idlemode and a loaded-mode emissions test (i.e., a test conducted while a vehicleis operating under load on a dynamometer to simulate actual driving conditions).To avoid the need for dynamometers at the fleet operators' test sites fleetoperators who have obtained a permit to test their own vehicles are allowedto substitute a 2500 revolutions per minute mode for the loaded-mode portionof the test.EPA has calculated the expected incremental benefit of loaded-mode testingusing MOBILE3 which contains EPA's standard estimates of the I/M reductionsfor both idle and loaded-plus-idle testing. Inputs for average speed, registrationmix, tampering/misfueling rates, and I/M stringency were those recommendedby the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality as being representativefor Phoenix. The incremental CO reductions from loaded-mode testing werecalculated by EPA to be 4.0 percent in 1991 and 5.9 percent in 1995.\6\<NOTE/>A more complete discussion of factors related to this calculationis contained in the TSD.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\In a subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, EPA plans to propose to amend the existingloaded-mode test procedure contained in 40 CFR Part 85, Subpart W. Theproposed changes will eliminate discrepancies between Arizona's loaded-modetesting protocol and EPA's requirements, thereby ensuring continued performancewarranty coverage for potentially affected consumers. The minor revisionspresently being contemplated do not change the CO benefit being creditedto Arizona's loaded-mode testing requirement and, therefore, the amendmentis not an issue in today's action.   The May 16, 1988 NPRM stated that EPA might go directly to final approvalof the loaded-mode testing requirement then being considered by the Arizonalegislature. EPA is today approving the loaded-mode testing requirement,for both Maricopa and Pima Counties, as part of the Arizona CO SIP.   <T3>3. Travel Reduction Program. </T3>H.B. 2206 establishes a travel reductionprogram (TRP) in the nonattainment area of Maricopa County, which is verysimilar to the Pima County Travel Reduction Ordinance. The legislationappoints Maricopa County as the implementing and enforcing agency and providesfunding for implementation through the State Air Quality Fund.   The TRP requires all employers of 100 or more full-time equivalent employeesat a worksite to appoint a transportation coordinator, distribute informationon alternative transportation modes to their employees, participate insurveys of alternative-mode usage of their employees, and develop a travelreduction plan. The travel reduction goals in the program are a 5 percentreduction in single-occupant vehicle trips to each major employer's worksitein the first year and an additional 5 percent in the second year. Travelreduction goals in the third and subsequent years are to be set by theMAG and enacted by County ordinance.   Under the TRP, major responsibility for overseeing the implementation ofthe program is held by the travel reduction program regional task force.This task force, the exact composition of which is to be decided by theMaricopa Board of Supervisors, may have representatives of major employers,development owners, Maricopa County jurisdictions, and public interestgroups. Duties of the task force include reviewing surveys and travel reductionplans and requiring employers to revise unapprovable and/or inadequateplans. The task force is also responsible for recommending that enforcementactions be initiated. The task force makes recommendations to the existingCounty Air Quality Advisory Committee, a volunteer committee which currentlyprovides recommendations to the Maricopa Board of Supervisors on air qualityrules and regulations.   Violations of the TRP are punishable by civil penalties of up to $350 perday. Violations include failure to designate a transportation coordinator,to disseminate information, to submit an approvable trip reduction plan,or to implement such a plan. Failure of a major employer to achieve thegoal is not considered a violation of the TRP although it does triggermandatory and specific revisions to the employer's travel reduction plan.In a letter dated July 22, 1988, the County outlined its expected budgetand staffing for implementing the TRP as well as a schedule for workingwith employers. Staffing for the program will be located in the Bureauof Air Quality Control with additional contracted services from the RegionalTransportation Authority. The County is currently scheduled to providemajor employers with survey forms by the second week of February 1989.After that, the County will provide major employers with survey forms assoon as the provisions of H.B. 2206 allow.  In overall concept the TRP is similar to the proposed Federal trip reductionregulation and the MAG model trip reduction ordinance discussed at lengthin the proposal for today's notice. The requirements in all three applyto employers with more than 100 employees at a worksite and include theappointment of an employer transportation coordinator, the annual disseminationof information on alternative transportation modes to employees, annualsurveys of employee commute modes, and the annual preparation, submittal,and implementation of a trip reduction plan that includes a report on thecurrent year's program. The trip reduction goals are the same in all threeprograms. All three enforce on the failure of an employer to meet the requirementslisted above. While EPA did propose in its trip reduction regulation toenforce on failure to meet the goal, the MAG model and the TRP do not.The TRP does require, however, that employers who have failed to meet theannual travel reduction goal implement a specified number of travel reductionstrategies. This automatic trigger functions similarly to enforcement ofthe goal. (See the subsection ``Trip/Travel Reduction Program'' under theResponse to Comment section of this notice for more information.)  In its May 16 notice, EPA proposed to grant an emission reduction creditof 1.8 percent in 1991 to the MAG model trip reduction ordinance and calculatedthe same emission credit for its own proposed regulation. Because the TRPcovers the same employers at the same trip reduction goal as both the MAGmodel and the federal regulation, EPA is granting a 1991 emission reductioncredit of 1.8 percent to the program.  <T3>4. Voluntary No-Drive-Day Program.</T3> In its 1987 SIP submittal,MAG and the State took a substantial emission reduction credit for a voluntaryno-drive-day program in Maricopa County. As described in that SIP submittal,the program was a joint undertaking of the Phoenix Metropolitan Chamberof Commerce, the Regional Public Transportation Authority, and the ArizonaOffice of Energy. The SIP submittal, however, contained no long-term fundingcommitment for the program. EPA's review of the proposed voluntary no-drive-dayprogram raised three concerns, and in May 1988, EPA proposed not to approvethe program as part of the SIP. The three concerns were assurance of adequateannual funding, the existence of an institutional framework meeting therequirements of CAA section 172(b)(10), and the development of a monitoringprogram to assess and verify the impact of the program.  H.B. 2206 in section 17 requires a County with a population of more than400,000 (effectively Pima and Maricopa Counties) to institute a voluntaryno-drive-day program. With the County having clear responsibility for implementation,the program meets the institutional requirements of CAA section 172(b)(10).H.R. 2206 also requires the DEQ to fund the voluntary no-drive-day programsfrom the Air Quality Fund; therefore, long-term funding of the programis assured. Based on these two changes, EPA is approving the voluntaryno-drive-day program as part of the SIP for both Maricopa and Pima Counties;however, because a monitoring protocol to assess and verify the impactof the program is still lacking, EPA is not at this time approving a specificemission reduction credit for the program. Before EPA can approve a specificemission reduction credit for this measure, the State must submit a monitoringprotocol for the program and any supporting documentation on the effectivenessof such a program in Maricopa or Pima County. Should the State submit thisinformation, EPA will at that time revisit the issue of an emission reductioncredit in the Maricopa SIP for a voluntary no-drive-day program.  <T3>5. Other Measures.</T3> In addition to the voluntary no-drive-day measure,EPA is also approving as part of the SIP, but without allotting emissionreductions credit, the public education program for oxygenated fuels, incentivesfor the use of compressed natural gas in vehicle fleets, allocation ofmoneys rom the Air Quality Fund for public transit projects and encouragementof vanpools for County and State employees. H.B. 2206 provides the legislativeauthority for these programs and specifically allocates moneys from theAir Quality Fund to the agencies which will implement them. H.B. 2206 allowssubsidies, in the form of payment to third-party companies and tax deductions,as incentives for County, State and private employers, respectively, toencourage the use of vanpools for employees. Although the emission reductionimpacts for these measures has not been determined, EPA believes thesemeasures support the attainment and maintenance demonstrations in the SIPand demonstrate the wide range of efforts the State has taken to improveCO in Maricopa County.<T3>6. New Source Review. </T3>On June 1, 1988, the State submitted a letterfrom itself, and on July 22, 1988, the State submitted a letter from MaricopaCounty. These letters make certain commitments regarding implementationof the State and Maricopa NSR rules pursuant to the understandings in EPA's1983 proposed approval of those rules. Based upon these letters, EPA istaking final action to approve the Maricopa NSR rules and, elsewhere inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>today, EPA is taking final action to approvethe State NSR rules. These commitment letters, which are appended to thetechnical support document for this notice, concern stack heights, temporarysources, growth allowances, net emission decreases, reasonable furtherprogress, volatile organic compounds, stationary sources, allowable offsets,permittee responsibility, and visibility protection. Both letters havebeen forwarded to the Office of the Federal Register for incorporationby reference into the Code of Federal Regulations as enforceable componentsof the Maricopa CO SIP. As such they are federally enforceable againstboth Maricopa County and the State of Arizona under sections 113 and 304of the Act. The commitments are also enforceable through citizen suit undersection 304 of the Act.<T3>B. Demonstration of Attainment, Maintenance and RFP</T3>In its May 16, 1988 NPRM, EPA concluded that any approvable SIP submittedby the State must demonstrate attainment of the CO standard by December31, 1991. EPA's evaluation of the air quality analysis in the MAG planindicates that a 22.0 percent reduction in the 1991 baseline CO emissionsis needed to demonstrate attainment of the 8-hour CO NAAQS by December31, 1991.Table 1 is a list of the control measures which were submitted by the Stateand to which EPA is granting specific emission reductions credit in thisnotice. EPA calculates that these measures will reduce CO emissions by22.3 percent in 1991 if the Sun Waiver is denied and 24.1 percent in 1991if the Sun Waiver is approved. These reductions are sufficient to reducethe ambient CO concentrations in Maricopa County to below the NAAQS bythe end of 1991. If the Sun Waiver is approved, EPA projects that attainmentwill be achieved by mid 1991. In Table 1, the total emission reductionsare not a sum of the individual emission reductions because measures thatcontrol tailpipe emissions (e.g. oxygenated fuels, and the I/M program)reduce the emission reduction impact of measures which control VMT (transit,and the travel reduction program).EPA has concluded that a demonstration of maintenance for 10 years afterthe date of approval is sufficient for the Maricopa SIP. Because the Maricopaplan does not provide modeling results past 1995, EPA has used availabledata to forecast the expected ambient air quality from the latest datein the plan, 1995, to 1998.The major factor influencing CO air quality in Maricopa is mobile sources.Using VMT growth projections and the expected reductions from the FMVCP,EPA estimates that the second maximum concentration at the design monitorwould be 10.0 ppm in 1998 assuming reductions from only the FMVCP, theState's I/M program (including loaded-mode testing and the 1987 legislation),and the freeway build-out. A 10.0 ppm reading would require a reductionof 10.3 percent in CO emissions from other SIP measures in order to showcontinued maintenance with the 9.0 ppm CO NAAQS. The oxygenated fuels programalone will achieve a 12.46 percent reduction (assuming the Sun Waiver isdenied) in 1998. This reduction is sufficient by itself to show continuedmaintenance. Because the estimates of the emission reductions from othermeasures rely on State-performed modeling which is unavailable for theperiod after 1995, the 1998 impacts of the other measures in the SIP cannotbe determined; however, these measures will continue to provide additionalemission reductions through 1998.Section 172 of the CAA requires that state implementation plans demonstratereasonable further progress (RFP). RFP is defined in section 171(1) as``annual incremental reductions in emissions of the applicable air pollutant(including substantial reductions in the early years following approval* * * and regular reductions thereafter) * * *''. During the CO seasonof 1988/89, the 1987 I/M program, loaded-mode I/M testing (scheduled tobegin January 1, 1989), short-range transit improvements, regional ridesharing,bicycle and pedestrian improvements, and alternative work hours will provideemission reductions. In addition, a voluntary no-drive-day program andthe voluntary introduction of oxygenated fuels may also provide emissionreductions during this season.During the 1989/90 CO season, the above measures as well as the then mandatoryoxygenated fuels program, and the initiation of the travel reduction programwill provide increasing emission reductions. In fact during this season,less than fourteen months after today's approval, the mandatory oxygenatedfuels program will provide the majority of the emission reductions neededfor attainment by the end of 1991. In 1990/91, higher goals in the travelreduction program will continue to reduce ambient CO concentrations. Bythe 1991/92 season, the projected date of attainment, the complete controlstrategy will provide sufficient emission reduction to demonstrate attainment.Even without these SIP measures, the modeling performed for the plan demonstratesthat considerable progress will be achieved in reducing emissions in MaricopaCounty with only the ``baseline'' measures_FMVCP, the pre-1987 I/M program,and the freeway build-out_despite high growth rates in VMT. The modelingshows that a 34 percent reduction in emissions was needed to demonstrateattainment in 1987, 25.6 percent is needed to demonstrate in 1990, and22.0 percent in 1991. In addition, H.B. 2206 requires that the oxygenatedfuels program, the travel reduction program, and the loaded-mode testingstart in 1989_more than two years before the date of attainment. Finally,the majority of the other SIP commitments specifically listed in Table1 are already being implemented and are providing emission reductions.All these factors provide sufficient evidence that the plan demonstratesRFP and meets the requirement for ``substantial reductions in the earlyyears.''<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Response to Comments</ITAG>EPA received a considerable number of comments in response to its May 16NPRM. Comments were made both in writing and at a June 10, 1988, publichearing in Maricopa County. The majority of the comments received dealtspecifically with the two federal measures that EPA proposed to promulgatein its FIP. Most of these comments are made moot by EPA's action todayto withdraw the FIP in preference to the State plan. However, some of thecomments received address the SIP submittals or bear on EPA's finding thatthe SIP is fully approvable under section 110 and Part D of the CAA. EPA'sresponse to those comments are given below. A summary of pertinent commentsreceived on the May 16 notice can be found in the technical support documentfor this rulemaking.A. Legal Issues<ITAG tagnum="81">Attainment Date</ITAG>The ACLPI commented that the attainment date for the Maricopa area shouldnot be three years from the date of SIP approval. ACLPI argued that afterpassage of the statutory Part D attainment dates, EPA should interpretthe Act as requiring attainment at the soonest time, essentially withoutregard to practicalities in order to implement Congressional intent insetting the original deadlines. As EPA previously explained in full, EPAbelieves that after December 31, 1987, a SIP needs to demonstrate attainmentno more quickly than as ``expeditiously as practicable'' but by certainfixed dates. See EPA's proposed post-1987 attainment policy, 52 FR 45044,45049 (November 24, 1987), and the proposal for today's action, 53 FR 17378,17381 (May 16, 1988), for a full discussion of EPA's legal interpretation.If EPA were to adopt ACLPI's position that post-1987 planning should providefor attainment at the soonest time, many post-1987 nonattainment areaswould have to resort to draconian measures with drastic social and economicimpacts_such as plant closings, gasoline rationing and mandatory no-driverestrictions_simply because such measures are physically available to bringabout attainment. EPA does not believe that Congress, if it had addressedthe post-1987 nonattainment situation now being faced, would have requiredsuch a result, even after passage of the Part D dates. EPA believes thatCongress would instead have regarded the ``as expeditiously as practicable''requirement to be still in place, albeit bounded in situations, such asthat of Maricopa County, by fixed attainment deadlines.ACLPI cites <T3>American Lung Association </T3>v. <T3>Kean, </T3>18 Envtl. L.Rptr. 20317(D.N.J. 1987), in support of itsposition. ACLPI misinterprets that case. That case in fact interprets theAct to require ``SIP implementation `as expeditiously as <T3>practicable' </T3>after December 31, 1987.'' <T3>American Lung Association, </T3>id. at 20317 (emphasis added). Thecase does not require SIP implementation more rapidly than practicableand does not set any outside date for attainment in the event no near termdate is practicable. This case is therefore consistent with EPA's position;indeed, the ``as expeditiously as practicable'' formulation would actuallyallow for a much longer attainment period in very severe nonattainmentareas.The Maricopa County SIP that EPA is approving today provides for attainmentby 1991. EPA believes that this is the appropriate attainment date forthe area in light of the Agency's conclusion that no measures beyond thosealready included in the Maricopa SIP are both practicable and would advancethat attainment date. ACLPI suggests a number of measures that it believesare available that together might advance the attainment date for the Maricopaarea. EPA cannot now conclude that any of these measures are both practicableand sufficient to materially advance the attainment date.Specifically, ACLPI suggests an immediate, major expansion of the transitsystem, a rigorous program of parking controls, exclusive bus lanes, winterdaylight savings time, mandatory no-drive days, and a statewide I/M program.The Maricopa SIP already contains some measures for expanded mass transitand HOV lanes. EPA does not believe there are grounds to conclude thatthe substantial expansion of the transit system that would be necessaryto advance the attainment date from 1991 could practicably be implementedin the short time between now and the end of 1990. EPA cannot require astate to observe winter daylight savings time since authority to establishor regulate daylight savings time is reserved to the U.S. Department ofTransportation's (USDOT) Office of General Counsel under the 1966 UniformTime Act. EPA believes that any program to create parking controls, mandatoryno-drive-days and exclusive bus lanes could not materially advance theattainment date, unless it were so stringent as to create the type of publicuproar that EPA faced when it promulgated such measures in FIPs in the1970s. In light of that experience, EPA cannot conclude that such stringentprograms would be practicable to implement. Beyond that, the Maricopa SIPalready contains the most stringent I/M program in the country, and ithas recently been expanded to include a loaded-mode testing feature. Althoughfurther expansion of the program might be practicable, EPA cannot concludefrom its experience with other states' less stringent programs that a significantexpansion in Arizona's tough program is certainly practicable. Therefore,EPA believes that the 1991 date derived by analogy to sections 110(a)(2)(A)and 110(e) is the appropriate attainment date for the Maricopa area.<ITAG tagnum="81">Reasonable Further Progress</ITAG>ACLPI commented that the proposed plan did not provide for reasonable furtherprogress towards attainment. EPA does not agree. The expanded I/M program,transit improvements, ridesharing program, increased bicycle and pedestriantravel, fleet conversions, alternative work hours, trip reduction ordinancesand the FMVCP will together provide measurable emissions reductions throughout1989 and 1990. It is true that the bulk of the emissions reductions willresult from the oxygenated fuels program, which will only be voluntaryin the 1988/89 CO season. However, EPA expects that the voluntary programwill still provide some reductions in 1988/89 season and sizable emissionsreductions will result from the mandatory program beginning in the 1989/90CO season. Together these measures provide for reasonable further progresstowards attainment.<ITAG tagnum="81">Reasonably Available Control Measures</ITAG>ACLPI commented that the Maricopa CO SIP does not provide for implementationof all reasonably available control measures (RACM) as required by section172(b)(2) of the Act. ACLPI specifically refers to transit improvementsand parking controls as reasonably available measures.EPA has long interpreted section 172(b)(2) as requiring implementationof only those available controls necessary to provide for attainment bythe applicable attainment date. This is because it would not be reasonableto require states to implement measures that, although technologicallyavailable, would not materially advance an area's attainment date. SeeEPA's General Preamble on Part D SIP preparation, 44 FR 20372, 20375 (April4, 1979).As explained above, EPA does not believe it has grounds to conclude thatany combination of clearly praticable measures would provide for attainmentin the Maricopa area before 1991. EPA believes that the approvable measuresin the Marcicopa SIP provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicableand that therefore any additional potentially available measures wouldnot be necessary to achieve timely attainment and consequently would notbe required as RACM.<ITAG tagnum="81">Maintenance</ITAG>Two commenters addressed the issue of maintenance of the CO standard. ACLPIcommented that the maintenance demonstration in the Maricopa plan is inadequatebecause it is not supported by the record and does not cover a sufficientlylong period of time. EPA disagrees. The maintenance demonstration is basedon the modeling and emissions projections in the MAG plan and EPA's ownprojections based on the data in the MAG plan. These projections indicatethat the Maricopa area will maintain the CO standard until at least 1998.This demonstration covers the ten-year time period which EPA proposed asappropriate for a maintenance demonstration in its proposed post-1987 CO/Ozonepolicy. ACLPI commented that a maintenance demonstration should not belimited to ten years but should instead extend to the limit of technicalfeasibility. On the other hand, the USDOT commented that EPA should notapply the maintenance requirements of its proposed post-1987 policy toany areas until the Agency has finalized the policy. EPA believes thatgiven these conflicting public comments the use of a ten-year maintenancedemonstration is appropriate. Although the post-1987 policy is not yetfinal, EPA believes that projections extending ten years are technicallyreliable and provide a manageable planning period. Projections beyond thatperiod become too speculative to be reliable.Moreover, although the Act requires SIPs to contain a demonstration ofmaintenance of the standards, the Act nowhere indicates the length of timesuch demonstrations should cover.Where the statute is unclear, EPA must fill any gaps using a rule of reasonableness.<T3>See Chevron v. NRDC, </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984). As reflected in theproposed post-1987 policy, and because projections of source growth andemissions reductions beyond ten years are too speculative, EPA has determinedthat a ten-year period is a reasonable period for a maintenance demonstrationin Maricopa County and that requiring a demonstration extending more thanten years would not be reasonable.In supplemental comments ACLPI pointed to 40 CFR 51.42 in support of itsassertion that at least a 20-year maintenance demonstration would be appropriate.That provision is part of EPA's 1975 maintenance program. The entire program,however, has been effectively superseded by the 1977 CAA amendments andcreation of Part D and the section 107 nonattainment area designations.The reference to maintenance in Part D (section 172) and the entire planningscheme in Part D were created in light of the failures of the 1970's effortsto produce sound state plans. They were not intended as a ratificationof EPA's approach to these issues in the previous years. While in 1975EPA apparently believed that a 20-year maintenance demonstration wouldbe desirable and feasible, EPA now views the issues differently. Upon subsequentreflection, in light of the Agency's post-1977 experience with computermodels for projecting mobile source emissions and with the inaccurate growthprojections in the initial round of Part D SIPs, EPA currently concludesthat projections beyond 10 years are simply too speculative. The Agency'srecent conclusions are reflected in the proposed post-1987 policy. Forthese reasons, EPA believes at this time that a maintenance demonstrationthrough 1998 is adequate for the Maricopa area.Finally EPA notes that the Maricopa SIP which EPA is approving today includesseveral recently-adopted meaures to which EPA had not assigned emissionreduction credit in the proposal for this action. These are the voluntaryno-drive-day program and the requirement under the oxygenated fuels programfor a specific market share of alcohol blends. EPA is not relying uponany reductions from these new measures to bring about attainment. However,the emission reductions from these measures will be available as additionalassurances that the Maricopa area will continue to maintain the CO standardinto the future.<ITAG tagnum="81">New Source Review (NSR)</ITAG>ACLPI commented that EPA could not approve the Maricopa CO SIP and liftthe construction ban in Maricopa County so long as the plan lacks an approvableNSR component. EPA has reviewed the Maricopa NSR program and has determinedthat it can be fully approved based upon Maricopa County's and the Stateof Arizona's commitments to interpret the regulation consistent with EPA'srequirements. The State submitted a letter from itself on June 1, 1988,and a letter from Maricopa County on July 22, 1988, which make the necessarycommitments. These commitment letters, which have been appended to theTSD for this notice, have been forwarded to the Office of Federal Registerfor incorporation by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations asenforceable component of the Maricopa CO SIP. As such are enforceable againstMaricopa County and the State of Arizona under sections 113 and 304 ofthe Act and will effectively control any court's interpretation of theState's and County's intent under the NSR rules.ACLPI also commented that the Maricopa CO plan does not meet the requirementof section 172(b)(11)(A) that the NSR program require a demonstration thatthe benefits of a proposed source significantly outweigh the environmentaland social costs imposed by the source. Section 172(b)(11)(A) technicallydoes not apply at all to Maricopa. The section only applies by its ownterms to areas that received attainment date extensions to 1987. EPA hasstated, however, that generally SIPs for areas that failed to attain in1982 as planned would have to meet all requirements applicable to extensionareas in order to demonstrate timely attainment. See Guidance Documentfor Correction of Part D SIPs for Nonattainment Areas, January 27, 1984.The Arizona NSR program does require a demonstration that the benefitsof a proposed project outweigh the project's environmental costs. EPA concludesthat with that provision Arizona's NSR program adequately complies withEPA's policy that non-extension areas that failed to attain generally meetthe Part D requirements for extension areas to demonstrate attainment.<ITAG tagnum="81">Contingency Plan</ITAG>ACLPI commented that the Maricopa plan does not include adequate contingencyprovisions. The ACLPI also commented that EPA should adopt a contingencyplan because of uncertainty of emission reduction estimates and shouldensure that it is legally enforceable and self-implementing. In its 1981guidance on SIP preparation, EPA indicated that all Part D SIPs shouldcontain contingency measures to compensate for unanticipated shortfallsin planned emission reductions. Although not directly required by the CAA,EPA believed that such measures would be appropriate to provide assurancethat an area would achieve timely attainment. It is true that the contingencyprovisions in the Maricopa SIP are not extensive. However, as mentionedabove, the recently adopted Arizona legislation mandates two measures thatEPA had not previously included in the Maricopa attainment demonstration.These measures are a requirement for a minimum market share of alcoholblends and the voluntary no-drive-day program. Although EPA cannot assignspecific emission reduction credits to these programs as part of this finalaction, they can result in additional emission reductions beyond thosenecessary to achieve timely attainment and may offset unanticipated shortfallsin planned emission reductions. These measures, which have already beenadopted, will adequately serve the function of the contingency provisionsEPA contemplated in 1981 in conjunction with the contingency measures inthe MAG plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">Conformity Provisions</ITAG>Two commenters addressed the plan's conformity provisions. (See discussionof section 176(c) and conformity generally in the May 16, 1988 proposal.)ACLPI commented that the provisions were inadequate, presumably becausethey failed to fully meet EPA's 1981 guidance establishing criteria forapproval of 1982 plan revisions as indicated in the proposal, and thereforeEPA should promulgate conformity provisions. On the other hand, USDOT commentedthat EPA should not require that the Maricopa plan contain the conformityprovisions outlined in either the proposed post-1987 policy of EPA's April1, 1980, ANPRM on conformity requirements. USDOT claims transportationactions are excluded from the 1980 ANPRM because of the June 12, 1980,USDOT/EPA agreement and that they also excluded from the proposed post-1987policy.Compliance with section 176(c) of the Act concerning conformity is primarilythe responsibility of the various federal agencies and metropolitan planningorganizations approving or funding projects. EPA's policy is to requireconformity requirements in SIPs as needed to protect the air quality standards.The control measures in the Maricopa SIP are basically all transportationrelated measures. The conformity provisions in the Maricopa SIP are adequateto insure compliance with section 176(c) in Maricopa County. EPA will continueto work with Maricopa County to incorporate additional conformity proceduresand criteria consistent with all outstanding EPA guidance as appropriatein light of the Agency's conclusions on conformity issues in its finalpost-1987 ozone/CO policy when it is published. See 52 FR 45044 (November24, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="81">Highway Funding Sanctions </ITAG>Several commenters addressed the proposed funding sanctions. ACLPI stronglysupported the termination of highway assistance, while USDOT asserted thatsection 176(a) highway funding sanctions are not available at all in theperiod beyond 1987. Several local agencies and the State opposed the impositionof sanctions because they believe the State was making reasonable effortsto develop an approvable SIP. Since EPA is today approving the MaricopaCO SIP, the Agency is withdrawing its proposal to impose funding sanctions;therefore, these comments are moot.B. Oxygenated Fuels The Agency's oxygenated fuels proposal included a description of the assumptionsand methods that EPA intended to use in evaluating the specific elementsof any subsequently adopted State program. Several comments were receivedon this methodology, although significantly more general comments werereceived on the federal proposal. Of these, the only comments that appeardirectly relevant to the approvability of the SIP pertain to the proposedOctober 1989 implementation date of the fuels program, which was both originallyproposed by EPA and chosen by Arizona. The basic question to be resolvedis whether the effective date represents progress toward attainment asexpeditiously as practicable. In evaluating this issue, EPA finds it particularly important to note thatthe State's program will likely result in the oxygen content of all gasolinein the Maricopa County nonattainment area being substantially above thelevels found in conventional fuels during the mandatory compliance period.This could result in a significant amount of new facilities being addedto the Phoenix petroleum terminal, or to refineries servicing the area,to produce the requisite oxygenated fules, i.e., the blending of MTBE and/oralcohol with gasoline. Such a situation is not dissimilar to that expectedunder the federal proposal, which prompted EPA to orignially select, andmost commenters to support, the October 1989 implementation date. Furthermore,many commenters pointed out the importance of instituting an oxygenatedfuels program that minimizes the risk for fuel supply disruptions, preventsunnecessary price increases, and has a high degree of public acceptance.EPA concurs and believes that the approximately one year leadtime affordedby the October 1989 date should be adequate to achieve these goals. Onthe other hand, the available information does not provide an adequatebasis to conclude that a significant acceleration in the date is possiblewithout jeopordizing these objectives. Therefore, the effective date forArizona's oxygenated fuels program appears reasonable to allow for theorderly transition from conventional to oxygenated gasolines. The remaining comments primarily related to EPA's January 1988 guidancefor calculating CO reduction benefits from alternative fuels, or to concernsassociated with the relatively high average oxygen content and likely largemarket share for alcohol blends under the federal proposal. The commentspertaining to the Agency's emission reduction methodology for oxygenatedfuels will be considered in a separate action, along with other informationthat has become available since the guidance was formulated. These commentsdo not call into question EPA's action on the SIP, primarily because thesuggested revisions to the guidance would likely increase the estimatedCO benefits for the program contained in the SIP. The comments pertainingto the relatively high oxygen content of EPA's proposal are also not directlyrelevant to the SIP, because the State program has less stringent oxygenrequirements. As a result, the Agency expects that the majority of gasolinesold in Phoenix during the wintertime compliance period will contain MTBE,which is widely regarded as a fully satisfactory oxygenating compound.A more complete discussion of these and other comments is contained inthe TSD for today's action.C. Trip/Travel Reduction ProgramsEPA received a number of comments on the proposed federal trip reductionregulation and the State travel reduction program. These comments fellinto one of three categories. The first category are positions and supportfor those positions on whether EPA should promulgate in its FIP a morestringent oxygenated fuels program in lieu of a federal trip reductionregulation. EPA had specifically asked in its proposal for comments onthis issue. The second category are comments on specific aspects of theproposed federal regulation such as area of coverage and whether enforcementunder CAA section 113 is appropriate for such a regulation. The final categoryare comments that deal with aspects of the State's travel reduction program.Because EPA is promulgating neither a trip reduction regulation nor anoxygenated fuels program, issues raised on trip reduction regulation versushigher oxygen levels are moot as are issues on specific aspects of thefederal regulation. The final category of comments bear on EPA's abilityto approve the State's travel reduction legislation under section 172 andare addressed below. ACLPI stated in its comments that the State's legislation failed in twoways to meet the section 172(b)(10) criteria that_as ACLPI writes_``allcontrol measures be supported by legally enforceable requirements, schedulesand timetables for compliance.'' ACLPI claims that H.B. 2206, which contains the travel reduction program,does not set dates by which employers' travel reduction plans must be submitted.While EPA agrees that the legislation does not set specific dates on whichthe requirements of the program must be met by major employers, EPA disagrees,with the implication that there is no enforceable schedule in the travelreduction program. In section 49-588, each major employer is required toprepare and submit a travel reduction plan in each year of the regionalprogram. By definition (see section 49-581(16)), the regional program isto begin in January 1989. Taken together, this language requires that everyemployer who is a major employer in 1989 prepare and submit a travel reductionplan by the end of 1989. While the legislation does give the County greatdiscretion on the exact date travel reduction plans must be submitted,it does constrain the overall timeframe therefore does not pose an issueunder the CAA section 172(b)(10) requirement for schedules and timetablesfor compliance. In addition, a letter from Maricopa County submitted withthe July 25, 1988 SIP submittal indicates that the County will begin theprogram as soon as H.B. 2206 allows, i.e., January 1, 1989. ACLPI further commented that because there were no sanctions against employersfor failure to achieve the trip reduction goal, the trip reduction programfails to meet the requirement that all control measures be supported by``legally enforceable requirements.'' EPA disagrees. In a very real sensethe TRP does impose sanctions against employers failing to achieve thegoal. The TRP requires any major employer who fails to meet the annualtrip reduction goal to implement a specific number of trip reduction strategies:Two in the first year of the regional program, three in the second, and,in the third and subsequent years, the strategies specified by the TRPTask Force. This process of triggering an automatic and specific revisionto the travel reduction plan deprives an employer of a good part of itsdiscretion under the program and represents a powerful incentive for employersto achieve the goals. Failure to revise the plan or to implement the requiredstrategies would trigger the enforcement process in the TRP, which in turnwill itself be enforceable by citizens and the Administrator under sections304 and 113 of the CAA. EPA therefore believes that the TRP meets the Act'srequirement concerning legal enforceability.D. Other Comments EPA received three comments regarding the benefits to be obtained fromthe State's I/M program. In the NPRM, EPA noted that the State had madean adjustment to the I/M credits in its modeling. This adjustment was tofreeze the I/M benefits for vehicles which had been in the I/M programfor more than five years. EPA stated in the NPRM that this adjustment wasinconsistent with accepted use of MOBILE3 and, further, that the Statedid not provide EPA with any data showing that such effect occurs in eitherthe Arizona I/M program or other I/M programs in the Country. EPA, therefore,recalculated the emission reductions needed for attainment excluding thisadjustment. Excluding the adjustment lowered the percent reduction neededto attain the CO standards in 1991. EPA received three comments regarding its recalculation of the I/M benefit.The State and MAG commented that MOBILE3 has always grossly underestimatedCO concentrations in Maricopa County and that the State's modeling, thoughstill underestimating CO concentrations, has proven to be considerablymore accurate. ACLPI commented that because the I/M program has been operatedexclusively by the State for more than a decade, EPA is not in the positionto question the State's conclusions regarding the emission reductions achievableby that program. The State has not provided any emissions data to support the accuracy offreezing I/M benefits after a vehicle has been in the program five years.MOBILE3, the mobile source emission factor model_including the routinesto calculate I/M credits_was developed by EPA after extensive public input.In the face of no State data to support its contention that MOBILE3 underestimatesCO concentrations in Maricopa County, EPA must stay with its publicly debatedpolicy on the use of MOBILE3 when determining the minimum reductions neededfor attainment. However, the State is free to base its own planning onthe higher emission reduction targets derived from its assumptions aboutI/M benefits. EPA encourages them to do so; however, in determining theapprovability of the attainment demonstration in the Maricopa SIP, EPAwill rely on its policy on calculating I/M benefits.In supplementary comments, ACLPI gave new vehicle miles traveled (VMT)numbers for Maricopa County which are higher than the numbers in the Maricopaplan. ACLPI commented that because the SIP underestimates the VMT numbers,EPA should disapprove the attainment demonstration in the SIP and adoptadditional FIP measures to address the increased emissions from the VMTgrowth.The simple existence of higher VMT numbers does not lead to the conclusionthat the attainment demonstration in the MAG plan is inadequate and thatadditional FIP or SIP control measures are needed. The VMT numbers suppliedby ACLPI show a substantial increase in baseline (1985) VMT numbers. Changesin the baseline data affect the model evaluation and thus the future-yearmodeling and the emission reduction needed for attainment in unpredictableways. Depending on the spatial distribution of the VMT and the effect onregional speeds, the emission reduction needed for attainment could increase,decrease or remain the same. Simply stated, the effect on the attainmentnumber of the VMT increases presented by ACLPI is indeterminate lackinga completely new modeling exercise.Given that this new VMT data has appeared near the conclusion of the currentSIP planning process and the data's impact on the SIP is indeterminate,the issue faced by EPA is what is the most appropriate use of this newdata. When determining the emission reductions needed for attainment, theState and MAG did use the most current data then available. After completingthe modeling in the spring of 1987, the State did revise the modeling resultsto reflect higher VMT figures that had then just become available. TheState has now submitted its complete plan which includes an adopted controlstrategy sufficient to demonstrate attainment using the best data availablewhen the control strategy was developed. In this situation, EPA believesthe most appropriate response to this new growth data is not to delay approvalof the SIP but rather to use the new data in the next round of planningas the State is already planning to do.In its comment regarding the CO plan attainment demonstration, ACLPI statesthat the model is based on an unrepresentative design value. ACLPI cites1984 monitored values of 20 ppm (high) and 19 ppm (2nd. high) from theWest Indian School microscale site as the values which should have beenconsidered for the design day.When a design value is selected from a multi-year data base, EPA policydictates that the second-highest concentration be used as the design valueon which to base a CO SIP. In the MAG CO plan, a 1985 monitored value of18.5 ppm was used as the design value. This value is essentially the sameas using the second-high 1984 value of 19 ppm, although it must be notedthis is not the reason for its selection. The State, in agreement withEPA, decided upon the Urban Airshed Model for modeling the SIP controlstrategy and initiated an intensive air quality and meteorological samplingprogram to acquire the data necessary to provide the inputs to the model.The design value was selected by the State from this 1985 data base asbeing the most representative value on which to model a control strategy.EPA agrees with the State's judgment about the representativeness of the1985 data.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary of Final Action</ITAG>In todays's notice, EPA is taking final action to approve the revisionsto the carbon monoxide state implementation plan for the Maricopa nonattainmentarea which were submitted by the State of Arizona on October 5, 1987, andJuly 18 and 22, 1988. Specifically, EPA is approving and incorporatingby reference into the SIP the <T3>MAG 1987 Carbon Monoxide Plan for the Maricopa County Area </T3>(includingthe resolutions of commitments contained in that plan) and portions ofArizona S.B. 1360 and H.B. 2206. In addition, EPA is approving specificemission reduction credits for the following measures: The 1987 I/M programimprovements, short-range transit improvements, expanded ridesharing, HOVlanes, freeway flow improvements, increased bicycle usage, pedestrian travelimprovements, conversion of buses to alternative fuels, alternative workhours, oxygenated fuels program, loaded-mode I/M testing (which also appliesto both Maricopa and Pima Counties), and a travel reduction program. Thespecific emission reduction credits for these measures are listed in Table1 of this notice. EPA is also approving as part of the SIP, but withoutemission reduction credits, the voluntary no-drive-day program (which appliesto both Maricopa and Pima Counties), the minimum gasohol market share requirment,public education programs for oxygenated fuels, incentives for the useof compressed natural gas in vehicle fleets, public transit projects, programsto encourage the use of vanpools for County, State and private employees,and allocation of monies from the State's Air Quality Fund to fund severalof these programs. Finally, EPA is approving the Maricopa County NSR regulations.EPA's evaluation of the control strategy submitted by the State shows thatthese measures will provide sufficient emission reductions to attain theCO standards in Maricopa County by December 31, 1991, maintain the standardsuntil after 1998, and provide RFP between plan approval and attainment.Therefore, EPA is today approving the State's demonstration of attainment.With these actions, EPA is approving the Maricopa portion of the ArizonaCO SIP as fully meeting the requirements of section 110 and Part D of theCAA. With this full approval, EPA is withdrawing the federal implementationplan that it proposed on May 16, 1988. EPA is also lifting the CAA section110(a)(2)(I) construction ban imposed in Maricopa County on September 23,1986, and withdrawing its May 16, 1988, proposal to impose highway fundingrestrictions under section 176(a).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Process </ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by October 11, 1988. This action may not be challenged later inproceedings to enforce its requirements.
