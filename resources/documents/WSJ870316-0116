Brown IIIStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMR LABORAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines' new pilots contract increases salaries for its new pilots as much as 29%, significantly weakening the two-tier wage concept that American pioneered.    &quot;It's the beginning of the end for the two-tier pay scale,&quot; said Timothy Pettee, an analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    But analysts said American won other concessions that will let it keep its labor-cost advantage over most of its major competitors, with the exception of Continental Airlines, a non-union carrier that has the lowest costs of any major carrier.    American, a unit of AMR Corp., reached agreement with its 6,000 pilots in February after almost a year of negotiations. American's pilots union, the Allied Pilots Association, ratified the new three-year pact earlier this month. Both the airline and the union have refused to discuss the contract until the union explains the details to its members.    The hefty pay raise that American granted its new pilots represents a major retreat from the two-tier pay scale that American introduced in 1983. Under the system, pilots hired since 1983 are paid a lower wage scale than senior pilots. The system allows American to reduce its average labor costs through rapid internal growth by increasing the percentage of employees earning the lower scale.    Under American's new contract, pilots hired under the lower pay scale, the B-scale, will now earn between 75% and 80% of the higher A-scale salary earned by pilots hired prior to 1983, estimates Kit Darby, vice president of the Future Aviation Professionals of America, an Atlanta group that tracks aviation careers. That is up from about 65% under the old contract, Mr. Darby says.    The new contract also provides that American's B-scale pilots will jump to the higher scale after 10 years, or becoming a captain, whichever comes first. Under American's old contract, the scales didn't merge until 17 years. Because of American's rapid expansion, some of its pilots could reach the rank of captain after only seven or eight years, Mr. Darby said.    Although those concessions lessen the advantage of the two-tier system, American still won a better contract than most of its competitors, analysts said. In recent contracts, most other carriers with two-tier systems have merged their pay scales after only five years.    Pilots hired since 1983 are the biggest winners under the new contract. B-scale pilots will receive immediate pay increases of between 11% and 29%, depending on experience and the type of plane they fly. On the other hand, senior pilots with more than 12 years of experience will only receive annual raises of about 2%. </TEXT></DOC>
