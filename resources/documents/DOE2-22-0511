Essentially these are the familiar ZETAsub(n) latticetheories, but carried to their logical extremes. First I will establishsome basic mathematical properties of ZETAsub(m) that are relevant tothe physical problems on hand. Next I will consider discrete versionsof heat (diffusion) equations and wave equations in 1 + 1 dimension.Here my main interest concerns the recurrence time, or the Poincare cycle,of the system. I will then briefly comment on equations in higher dimensions,coordinate transformations, invariance or non-invariance properties ofthe system, and the partition function.</TEXT></DOC>
