By noon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contractfor West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, wasup 11 cents at $20.02.   On Tuesday, the May crude oil contract had settled at $19.91 abarrel, down 62 cents from Monday's close.   In reaction to the Alaskan oil spill that temporarily closed amajor port, the contract had gone up 38 cents a barrel Monday toclose at $20.53, the highest level since Aug. 14, 1987, when itsettled at $20.57.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange today,heating oil for April delivery was down 0.24 cent to 54.80 cents agallon and the April unleaded gasoline contract was up 0.52 cent at59.20 cents a gallon after two hours of trading.   Analysts blamed Tuesday's decline largely on profit-taking andconcerns about whether OPEC ministers will ease productionrestraints during their meeting in Vienna this week.   The April contract for wholesale home heating oil plunged onTuesday by 2.54 cents closing at 55.04 cents a gallon, after rising1.06 cents Monday.   April unleaded gasoline, which gained 1.73 cents in the previoussession, settled down 1.07 cents to 58.68 cents a gallon.   Monday's rally was triggered by the accident off the Alaskanport of Valdez, where an Exxon Corp. tanker ran aground and spilledan estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince WilliamSound. The accident forced the closing of the port, temporarilycutting U.S. crude supplies by a quarter.   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst at Elders Futures Inc., said themarket sold off Tuesday because prices had risen too high, too fastin the previous session.   ``I think the market was overbought,'' he said. ``People are nowcashing in.''   Also depressing oil prices were worries that the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries might loosen its production quota tohelp slow recent price increases at its regular meeting in Vienna.   ``It introduced an era of uncertainty that didn't existbefore,'' said William Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.   OPEC ministers were upbeat about the strong crude market butreluctant to predict that longer-term prices would continue theirrecent climb, which has seen WTI rising by some $5 a barrel sincelast October.   The 13 member nations agreed last fall to limit their totaloutput to 18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of this yearto support a price of $18 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
