It's a 109-page soft-cover book _ The Directory for Small-ScaleAgriculture _ which its chief promoter says will be ``a handy tool''for anyone seeking to establish a small farm or improve theoperation of an existing acreage.   Howard W. (Bud) Kerr Jr., director of the department's Office forSmall-Scale Agriculture, said Thursday that the publication is ``notonly for those who have the acreage but for those who arecontemplating getting into the ownership of a small parcel ofground.''   Kerr added in an interview: ``They have dreams, they havevisions. They don't know how to network, how to reach the rightsource of information.''   The book tells how to trace subject matter to hundreds of sourceslisted alphabetically, with addresses, telephone numbers andspecialties. Kerr said a user with questions can ``go to the horse'smouth for an answer.''   For example, someone in Georgia (or elsewhere, for that matter)might want to know about short-stake tomatoes, peppers and colecrops. There's an address and phone number for an expert at theUniversity of Georgia.   What about greenhouse production of European cucumbers, orperhaps khigh bush and rabbit eye blueberries? There's a listing forsomeone at USDA's South Central Family Farm Research Center,Booneville, Ark.   The latest in research on fresh market vegetables in NewHampshire? Plant scientists at the University of New Hampshire,Durham, will be able to help.   And if a Virginia broccoli growers has problems with club rootdisease, perhaps a call to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and StateUniversity, Blacksburg, could help.   Kerr said the directory is a pioneer effort for his office, whichis part of the department's Cooperative State Research Service, anagency that has close working ties with land-grant and other stateinstitutions.   In a statement included in the directory, Kerr said the intent isto ``link the vast network of people in the vast federal and statesystems'' with others who work the nation's small farms.   ``Seven out of every 10 family farms in America are small-scalefarms grossing $40,000 a year or less,'' he said. ``Apart fromproduction, these small-scale farms also contribute to thepreservation of the environment, the stability of the communitystructure which maintains a varied landscape for people to live, andthe supply of agricultural materials for food and industrialpurposes.''   Kerr said the book can be ordered from: Superintendent ofDocuments, Government Printing Office, North Capitol Street NW,Washington, D.C. 20402. Refer to stock number 001-000-04539. Ortelephone 202 783-3238. The cost is $5.50 per volume; foreign ordersare $6.88 each.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Department economists areforecasting a significant rise this summer in broiler production.   Over all of 1989, broiler output is expected to rise 5 percentfrom last year, when production was up 4 percent from 1987.   However, the department's Economic Research Service said broilerproduction in the first quarter of this year rose only 3 percent,compared with a 7 percent gain during January, February and March of1988.   Thus, the agency said in the June issue of Agricultural Outlookmagazine, broiler output in the second quarter probably will be up 4percent from a year earlier, while third-quarter production may gain7 percent.   Analysts said the production increase is being fed by ``highprices and lower feed costs'' and that net returns to broilerproducers have been on the plus side for a year.   Broiler wholesale prices based on a composite city marketaveraged almost 64 cents per pound in April, well above the 49 centsof a year earlier, the report said. The average in the first threemonths was 59 cents.   ``With higher summer demand for broilers and tighter second-halfbeef supplies, wholesale prices may average 68 to 70 cents for thesecond quarter and 65 to 71 cents for the third,'' the report said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department says it has found nosignificant environmental impact from field trials of tomatoesengineered genetically to resist insects.   The Monsanto Co., Chesterfield, Mo., is conducting the field testin Hughson, Calif., the department's Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service said Thursday.   Scientists used a delta endotoxin gene found naturally in thebacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to certaindestructive caterpillars. Monsanto is also testing the experimentaltomatoes in Florida and Illinois.</TEXT></DOC>
