Eating out of hand, dressed intomato-splattered aprons is the warm, convivial informality I had in mind.After all, with all our concerns, who needs to worry about which fork to usewhen? These are some of my favorite dough and topping combinations.;   Encourage your guests to design their own.;    Baking Note: A baking stone ortile is a wonderful piece of equipment that assures a crisp pizza crust.Widely available in cookware shops, it may be used for baking breads andpastries as well. The pizza is baked directly on the stone so that the heattransference is immediate and strong. The pizza is formed on a peel that isused like a giant spatula to transport the pizza to and from the oven. Theseare both good investments if you are serious about pizza making. Conventionalpizza pans will almost do the job if your oven is hot enough.; BASIC PIZZADOUGH AND VARIATIONS;  Basic Dough; 1 package rapid-rise yeast;  3/4 cup warmwater (about 110 degrees);  Pinch sugar; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 2 1/2  cupsall purpose flour;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  In small bowl combine yeast, water andsugar.
