Bennett saysteacher Jaime Escalante's dramatic success in teaching calculus toHispanic teen-agers in East Los Angeles puts the lie to the notionthat poor children cannot learn.   Bennett accompanied the Garfield High School teacher to theWashington premiere of ``Stand and Deliver,'' a movie aboutEscalante.   ``I have been to his classroom. I have seen the miracle inprocess,'' Bennett told the opening-night crowd. ``Jaime Escalanteis dedicated to his students, he is dedicated to their future. Heis a true, genuine American hero.''   Escalante dined with Bennett at the Department of Educationbeforehand after guest-teaching calculus at three suburban Virginiaschools. Today he was being feted at the embassy of his nativeBolivia.   ``I feel great. What you're going to see is 90 percent true,''said Escalante, who is portrayed on film by actor Edward JamesOlmos of ``Miami Vice.''   ``I'm not doing anything new. I'm just helping my students reachtheir highest possible degree of personal development,'' he said.   The movie shows how Escalante cajoled a rambunctious group ofteens from an East Los Angeles barrio into taking calculus, only tohave the Educational Testing Service suspect they cheated when theypassed the Advanced Placement test en masse in 1982.   They retook the rigorous exam and passed again with flyingcolors, and since then scores of Escalante's pupils have followedin their footsteps. Eighty-seven received advanced college creditin calculus last year.   Escalante sold math to them as ``the great equalizer'' and toldthe students that as descendants of the Mayans, they had math intheir bones.   ``The only thing I'm doing is sharing knowledge,'' said theteacher, who has seen the movie before and didn't stay forWednesday night's showing. He left when the lights went down,telling Bennett he was worn out from teaching calculus all day.   Over dinner at the Department of Education, Escalante expressedconcern that his students back at Garfield High ``are falling waybehind because of this trip,'' Bennett related afterwards.   ``This guy is the real thing,'' said Bennett.   Bennett emerged full of praise for the film, saying, ``I thinkwe're going to see a lot more courses in calculus. I think it'sgoing to obviously lend great support to the whole idea ofexpectations, of kids living up to what we expect of them.   ``It's a movie that defies the notion that children can't learn_ that children of poor circumstance and background can't havetheir part in the American dream,'' he said.   Bennett himself has said repeatedly that poor minority childrenare best served by schools that hold them to rigorous standards,not ones that water down their demands.</TEXT></DOC>
