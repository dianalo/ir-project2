This section requires the Secretary ofthe Interior to review, in accordance with section 3(d) of the WildernessAct, all lands in refuges in Alaska not Congressionally designated as wildernessas to their suitability or nonsuitability for the preservation as wildernessand report Department recommendations to the President. Although large tracts of land in the refuge were found to meet the criteriaof the Wilderness Act for designation as wilderness, not all of these landswere proposed for wilderness designation because of management strategiesthat will be used to meet refuge purposes. As a result, a range of wildernessalternatives was evaluated subsequent to the Service's selection of itsproposed management alternative in the Final Alaska Peninsula Plan. Fourwilderness proposals, ranging from recommending all refuge lands that qualifyfor wilderness designation to recommending no additional lands for wildernessdesignation, were examined in the Draft Statement. The Record of Decisionfor the Final Alaska Peninsula Plan recommended that an additional 640,000acres be proposed for designation as wilderness as does the proposed actionin the Wilderness Review Amendment and Supplemental Environmental ImpactStatement. The wilderness review in the Final Alaska Peninsula Plan/EnvironmentalImpact Statement/Wilderness Review discussed the wilderness suitabilityof lands on the refuge, but did not adequately evaluate the environmentalimpacts of the wilderness proposal. To ensure full compliance with theWilderness Act and the National Policy Act, the Fish and Wildlife Servicehas prepared this Wilderness Review Amendment and Supplemental EnvironmentalImpact Statement, clearly discussing the proposal for and environmentalimpacts of wildeness designation on the refuge. All agencies and persons wishing to comment are urged to do so as soonas possible. However, all comments received by the date given above willbe considered in preparation of the Final Supplemental Environmental ImpactStatement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 8, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Bruce Blanchard, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Environmental Project Review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-15622 Filed 7-14-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-55-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
