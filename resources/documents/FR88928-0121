Each Master Account consists of one more ProprietaryAccounts and associated Seg Accounts, Agency Accounts and associated SegAccounts and/or Pledgee Accounts. Article II, Rule 13 (formerly 12), isamended to require separate determination, for each Master Account, ofthe permissibility of Account Transfers (see paragraph 7 below). Sections1 and 2 of Article II, Rule 13 (formerly 12), have been amended to allowa Participant to transfer Securities both within and between its MasterAccounts. Rule 15 (formerly 14) has been amended to allow for transfersof funds between Master Accounts. Each Participant's Master Accounts willbe subject to the Participant's obligations for all of its Master Accounts(see paragraph 13 below).(2) <T3>Abeyance Account.</T3> Article II, Rule 13 (formerly 12), section 1(c),is amended to provide for recording in an Abeyance Account, newly definedin Article I, Rule 1 , of Securities which have been debited from the DepositoryAccount of a Delivering Participant prior to the time they are creditedto a Receiving Participant's Depository Account. A new paragraph addedto Article II, Rule 3, section 1, provides that there is no transfer oftitle to such Securities until they are credited to the Receiving Participant'sDepository Account or the associated MBSCC Transfer Account and that therecording of such Securities in the Abeyance Account neither extinguishesnor creates any interest of the Corporation in the Securities.(3) <T3>Hold in Custody Accounts.</T3> Amendments to Article II, Rule 1, providefor the creation of a new type of Seg Account, newly defined in ArticleI, Rule 1 as a Hold in Custody Account, to permit the bulk segregationof Securities. Rule 2, section 2, is amended to include any debits or creditswith respect to Securities in a Hold in Custody Account in the computationof the Cash Balance for the Depository Account from which the Securitieshave been transferred. Rule 4 is amended to provide that Securities transferredto a Hold in Custody Account, like Securities in other Seg Accounts, arenot subject to the Corporation's lien.Article II, Rule 4 is amended to make it clear that the Corporation willhave no lien on Securities in Hold in Custody Accounts, on Agency Seg CreditBalances, or on principal and interest pledged to third-party lenders toenable the Corporation to fund principal and interest advances.(4) <T3>New Class of Limited Purpose Participants. </T3>Article II, Rule 1,section 2, is added to provide for the maintenance of Limited Purpose Accounts,defined in Article I, Rule 1, as Depository Accounts maintained for LimitedPurpose Participants. Limited Purpose Participants are defined in ArticleI, Rule 1, as issuers of GNMA Securities or Warehouse Lenders taking deliveryto GNMA Securities originally issued through the Depository. A WarehouseLender is defined in Article I, Rule 1, as a lender which has advancedfunds to a prospective issuer of GNMA Securities secured by mortgages whichwill underlie such GNMA Securities. New Article III, Rule 5, provides fororiginal issuance of GNMA Securities through the Depository under a procedurewhereby the Corporation has no interest in new Securities received fromGNMA's issuing agent and immediately credits the Securities to the DepositoryAccount of the appropriate Participant or Limited Purpose Participants.Article II, Rule 1, section 4 (formerly 3), is amended to clarify the respectivewarranties of Limited Purpose Participants regarding their Limited PurposeAccounts_issuers representing that no third party has any interest in theSecurities credited to their Depository Accounts and Warehouses Lendersrepresenting that Securities are credited to and transferred from theirDepository Accounts in conformity with their pledge agreements with theissuers. Rules 12 and 13 (formerly 11 and 12) are amended to permit LimitedPurpose Participants to withdraw Securities, to deliver or receive Securitiesfree and to receive Securities free but not Versus Payment. Because LimitedPurpose Participants cannot receive Securities Versus Payment, ArticleII, Rule 4, is amended to make it clear that the Corporation will haveno lien on Securities in Limited Purpose Accounts, and no provision ismade in Article II, Rule 9 (formerly 8) for the computation of Net FreeEquity with respect to Limited Purpose Accounts.A new clause (d) is added to Article II, Rule 2, section 2, to providefor the computation of a Limited Purpose Cash Balance, which is subjectto the same credits as any other Cash Balance but is debited only for amountsowed to the Corporation for services or fines and for funds transferredpursuant to Rule 15 (formerly 14) for reconciling differences in ContractValue for reported transactions and adjustments for payments of principaland interest.Throughout the Rules, provisions of general application have been amendedto include Limited Purpose Participants.(5) <T3>Participation Standards. </T3>Article IV, Rule 1, section 3 (formerly2), is amended to establish qualification guidelines for Participants andLimited Purpose Participants. Under these guidelines, the Corporation normallywill expect banks and similar institutions applying to become Participantsto have equity capital of at least $100,000,000, brokers and dealers tohave regulatory net capital of at least $50,000,000, and other applicantsin other categories to have at least the equivalent in equity or regulatorycapital. Applicants to become Limited Purpose Participants normally willbe expected to have equity capital of at least $10,000,000. (Former clause(a) of Rule 1, section 1, which described the qualifications of mortgagebankers to become Participants, is deleted, given the new provisions forLimited Purpose Participants.) However, the Corporation may impose a greateror lesser capitalization standard on any applicant based upon (a) the anticipatedvalue of the positions the applicant proposes to maintain with, and theanticipated volume and risks associated with the types of transactionsthe applicant proposes to process through, the Depository and (b) the overallfinancial condition of the applicant.Article IV, Rule 1, sections 7 and 8 (formerly 6 and 7), have been amendedto require applicants and Participants and Limited Purpose Participantsthat are regulated by governmental authorities to supply the Corporationwith copies of any financial reports submitted to such authorities. ArticleIV, Rule 1, sections 7 and 8 also mandate submission of such other financialinformation as the Corporation reasonably may require.(6) <T3>Participants Fund. </T3>Article V, Rule 2, section 2, is amended torequire each Limited Purpose Participant to make a Mandatory Deposit tothe Participants Fund in the amount of $50,000 (or such higher amount asthe Corporation may determine). Under new Article V, Rule 2, section 4,this deposit must be made in cash.Article V, Rule 2, section 2, is further amended to require each Participantto make a Mandatory (formerly Minimum) Deposit to the Participants Fundfor each of its Master Accounts ranging from $1,000,000 to $10,000,000(or such higher minimum and maximum amounts as the Corporation may determine),the exact amount being a prescribed percentage of average gross debitsto its Cash Balances for Depository Accounts included within the MasterAccount on settlement days as prescribed by the Public Securities Association.Under new Article V, Rule 2, section 4, at least $150,000 (or such higheramount as the Corporation may determine) of the Mandatory Deposit (definedin Article I, Rule 1 as the Required Cash Deposit) must be made in cash.The remainder of a Participant's Mandatory Deposit may be in the form ofeither cash or approved government securities.Article V, Rule 2, section 3 is amended to make clear that Optional (formerlyAdditional) Deposits to the Participants Fund may be used to (a) provideSupplemental Processing Collateral (see paragraph 7 below), (b) prefundDebit Balances, (c) allow free transfers and withdrawals of Securitiesfrom MBSCC Transfer Accounts before they have been paid for and (d) permitreclamations to Agency Seg Accounts that would otherwise produce an impermissibleDebit Balance. New Article V, Rule 2, section 4 provides that, for thepurposes described in clauses (b) through (d) above, Optional Depositsmust be in cash; for other purposes, they may be in the form of approvedgovernment securities.   Article V, Rule 2, sections 5 and 6 (formerly 4 and 5), are amended toallow Participants with more than one Master Account to reallocate cashand securities deposits to the Participants Fund with respect to one MasterAccount to another Master Account, provided that such reallocation doesnot result in the Participant's failure to satisfy the Mandatory Depositand Net Free Equity Requirements for the Master Account from which reallocationis to be made.   (7) <T3>Net Free Equity and Reserve on Gain. </T3>Article I, Rule 1, adds anew definition of Net Free Equity, which will refer to Proprietary, Agencyor Pledgee Net Free Equity, as the context may require. The definitionof Reserve on Gain in Article I, Rule 1, is amended to include the excessof the Market Value of Securities receivable Versus Payment over the pricepayable.   The computation of Net Free Equity in Article II, Rule 9, section 1, hasbeen changed so that Net Free Equity for any Depository Account includedwithin a Master Account now includes Supplemental Processing Collateral.Article I, Rule 1 defines Supplemental Processing Collateral for any MasterAccount as the sum of (a) Optional Deposits with respect to that MasterAccount, (b) a percentage of the Mandatory Deposit as determined from timeto time by the Corporation, (c) Excess Proprietary Securities and (b) ExcessMarket Margin Differential (to the extent of the Applicable Percentageof the Market Value of securities deposits and 100% of collected cash,in the case of (a), (b) and (c)). Excess Proprietary Securities are definedin Article I, Rule 1 as Securities in any Proprietary Account includedwithin a Master Account that are not required to collateralize transactionsin such Proprietary Account. Given the inclusion of Supplemental ProcessingCollateral in the computation of Net Free Equity, Article II, Rule 13,is amended to eliminate the former concept of permitting negative Net FreeEquity to be offset by the Collateral Value of a Participant's Collateral(such terms having been replaced in Article I, Rule 1 by reference to SupplementalProcessing Collateral). An Account Transfer resulting in negative Net FreeEquity no longer will be processed.   (8) <T3>Net Debit Monitoring. </T3>New Article II, Rule 2, section 4 providesthat each Participant may be assigned, in a manner prescribed in the Procedures,a Net Debit Monitoring Level, defined in Article I, Rule 1, which willbe applied to all of the Master Accounts maintained by the Participant.If a Participant's Debit Balances for all of its Depository Accounts, netof all Credit Balances, reach that level, the Corporation may require theParticipant either to confirm its ability to pay its net Debit Balanceor to prefund its Debit Balances through Optional Deposits in case to theParticipants Fund. The Corporation will retain the right to reduce a Participant'sNet Debit Monitoring Level Pursuant to Article IV, Rule 1, section 11 (formerly10), in the event that the Participant no longer meets the financial requirementsfor participation.   (9) <T3>Cash Settlement. </T3>Article I, Rule 1, is amended to clarify thedefinitions of Agency Cash Balance, Agency Seg Cash Balance, Pledgee CashBalance and Proprietary Cash Balance, and add new definitions of LimitedPurpose Cash Balance, Limited Purpose Credit Balance and Limited PurposeDebit Balance.   Article II, Rule 2, section 2(c), is amended to make clear that, in computingAgency Cash Balances, that the Corporation may credit, as well as charge,such Balances for reasons not directly related to the transfer of Securities.Provisions in Article II, Rule 2, section 2, are amended to include allamounts payable by the Corporation in the computation of Credit Balances,not only those that directly relate to the Corporation's maintenance ofDepository Accounts.   Article II, Rule 2, section 3 is amended to provide that, if a Participanthas prefunded payment of its Debit Balances by making Optional Depositsin cash to the Participants Fund, the Corporation may charge the ParticipantsFund rather than requiring a separate settlement payment.   Article II, Rule 2, section 3, is also amended to indicate that cash settlementsfor Limited Purpose Accounts will be effected in the same manner as cashsettlements for any other Depository Accounts,   A paragraph is added to Article II, Rule 2, section 3, providing that allsettlement payments will be made to/from a bank account maintained by theCorporation separate and apart from its other funds, and that the Corporationwill not make any withdrawals or transfers of funds from such account exceptto pay amounts owed by Participants to the Corporation until Participants'Credit Balances have been paid in full.Another paragraph added to Article II, Rule 2, section 3, provides thatParticipants may elect to net its Credit and Debit Balances within a MasterAccount and make a single payment to, or receive a single payment from,the Corporation. If a Participant makes only a partial payment of its netDebit Balance, the payment will be applied first to any Agency Debit Balance,then to any Pledgee Debit Balance, then to any Proprietary Debit Balance(such applications to be made pro rata if there are two or more Proprietaryor Agency or Pledgee Debit Balances).Article II, Rule 7 (formerly 6), is amended to provide that, in the eventof a system failure and settlement based on duplicate records, a DeliveringParticipant's Cash Balances will exclude credits arising from Account TransfersVersus Payment that have not yet been matched by corresponding debits tothe Cash Balance of a Receiving Participant (i.e., credits arising fromtransactions reflected in the Abeyance Account).(10) <T3>Deliverer's Security Interest.</T3> Article II, Rule 3, section 1,is amended to provide that, to secure the Corporation's obligation to payParticipants' and Limited Purpose Participants' Credit Balances, when aParticipant or Limited Purpose Participant initiates an Account Transferof Securities Versus Payment, the Corporation will either transfer to theDelivering Participant or Limited Purpose Participant a security interestin such Securities or, if the Delivering Participant or Limited PurposeParticipant is a Warehouse Lender or is a Pledgee Participant returningSecurities to a Pledgor Participant Versus Payment, permit it to retainits existing security interest. The security interest so transferred orretained is defined in Article I, Rule 1 as the Deliverer's Security Interest.Article II, Rule 3, section 3, is amended to make clear that the Deliverer'sSecurity Interest is extinguished when the Securities are transferred tothe Receiving Participant's Depository Account against payment, while ArticleII, Rule 6, section 1 is amended to indicate that the Deliverer's SecurityInterest is extinguished at the time a defaulting Participant's securitiesare pledged to a third-party lender.(11) <T3>Pledges.</T3> Two new defined terms, Pledgor Participant or LimitedPurpose Participant and Pledgee Participant are added to Article I, Rule1, replacing prior references to borrowing and lending Participants. ArticleII, Rule 1, section 1(c), and the definition of Pledgee Account in ArticleI, Rule 1, are amended to make it clear that a Participant may maintaina Pledgee Account as agent for a third party.(12) <T3>Reversal of Agency Transactions. </T3>Article II, Rule 13 (formerly12), section 6 (formerly 5), permitting an agent, prior to a designatedcuttoff time, to reverse transactions in its Agency Account if it believesin good faith that its principal will default in its obligations to theagent, is amended to included transactions in a Pledgee Account maintainedby a Participant acting as an agent. Article II, Rule 13, section 6 isalso amended to make it clear that any such reversal is subject to a checkof the Delivering Participant's Net Free Equity.(13) <T3>Default Procedures.</T3> A new Rule 5 is added to Article II, entitlingthe Corporation to apply twoard satisfaction of the Limited Purpose Participant'sDebit Balance its cash deposit to the Participants Fund and any other cashor property except Securities the Corporation holds for the Limited PurposeParticipant. Article II, Rule 6 (formerly 5), section 1, is amended toenumerate the actions that the Corporation may take in the event of a Participant'sdefault, in the indicated order or such other order as the Corporationdeems appropriate to facilitate orderly settlement.(a) A new section 1(a) of Rule 6 provides that the Corporation will eliminatethat portion of the defaulting Participant's unpaid Debit Balance thathas no corresponding credits to other Participants' or Limited PurposeParticipants' Cash Balances (e.g., fees owed to the Corporation) by chargingthe defaulting Participant's Required Cash Deposit to the ParticipantsFund for the Master Account which includes the Depository Account whichincludes the Depository Account to which the unpaid Debit Balance relatesand, if necessary, for any other Master Account of the Participant.(b) Section 1(b) (formerly 1(a)) provides that the Corporation will offsetagainst the unpaid Debit Balance any Proprietary Credit Balance otherwisepayable by the Corporation to the defaulting Participant.(c) Section 1(c) (formerly 1(b)) provides that the Corporation, at itsoption, if the defaulting Participant is a Pledgee Participant that hasdefaulted in payment of its Pledgee Debit Balance, may return to PledgorParticipants any Securities in the MBSCC Transfer Account associated withthe Pledgee Participant's Pledgee Account and reverse the related debitsand credits to the Pledgee and Pledgor Participants' Cash Balance.(d) Section 1(d) is amended to make it clear that the Corporation may useits own funds or funds borrowed from third-party lenders to cover the remainingunpaid Debit Balance by pledging (i) any Securities held in the MBSCC TransferAccount associated with the Depository Account to which the unpaid DebitBalance relates, if such Depository Account is a Proprietary or AgencyAccount, any Securities held in such Account, and any Excess ProprietarySecurities; (ii) any securities deposited by the defaulting Participantin the Participants Fund for the Master Account which includes the DepositoryAccount to which the unpaid Debit Balances relates and, if necessary, forany other Master Account of the Participant; and (iii) any property depositedin the Participants Fund of the Clearing Division that constitutes ExcessMarket Margin Differential.(e) A new section 1(e) provides that the Corporation will apply to paymentof the Debit Balance (i) the defaulting Participant's Mandatory Depositin cash in excess of its Required Cash Deposit for the Master Account whichincludes the Depository Account to which the Debit Balance relates and,if necessary, for any other Master Account;
