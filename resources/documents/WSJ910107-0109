It's not pumping upstock prices anymore.   From a low last October of 2365.10 in the Dow JonesIndustrial Average, the stock market recovered 268.56 pointsby year end, helped immensely by falling interest rates and acorresponding rally in bonds.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, rates fell further. Long-term Treasury bondyields sank to 8.2% from 8.25%, while prices gained $5 foreach $1,000 face amount. Banks cut their prime, or base,lending rate, and there's talk of another reduction inshort-term rates by the Federal Reserve.   Despite all that, stocks fell. The industrial averagebegan 1991 with a drop of 67.57 points, or 2.57%. The DowJones Utility Average, an interest rate barometer that rosesteadily as yields began to drop in early autumn, has alsofailed to rally in response to the most recent interest ratedeclines. It's down 0.84% in the first three trading days ofthis year.   Why have the stock and bond markets parted company? Therapidly weakening economy is the main reason. Stock investorslike slowly declining long-term bond yields because thatsignals moderating inflation and no serious slowing of theeconomy.   &quot;The reason stock prices almost quadrupled from 1982 to1987 is that you had four years of positive economic growthaccompanied by declining rates,&quot; says Ray Dalio, president ofBridgewater Associates, a research firm.   But a strong bond rally can mean trouble for the U.S.economy because it indicates that the price of goods -- andcorporate profits -- are falling rapidly. As the economyentered a recession in 1982, long-term bond yields fellsharply from about 14% to 10%. Like the situation today,stocks fell as yields declined. The 1981-1982 bear marketshaved the Dow industrials by 24.1%.   Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Goldman Sachs,says last week's diverging stock and bond markets suggest&quot;the economic data we're seeing doesn't support the idea thatwe are at the trough of the economic decline.&quot; She adds: &quot;Theeconomy is going to weaken further.&quot;   Though some investors claim they're ready for bad earningsreports, market reaction indicates otherwise, Ms. Cohen says.&quot;In the cases of companies whose managements have given someadvance indications of lower earnings, the market has notbeen very forgiving,&quot; she says, noting the recent decline inTiffany's stock on news of its deteriorating outlook.   Several bad earnings surprises and continuous gloomyeconomic reports may shake investor confidence in the weeksahead, producing the cathartic sell-off typical of a bearmarket. Although Ms. Cohen doesn't think it's that bad yet,Goldman recommends an asset allocation of only 50% stocks;the rest should be in bonds (30%) and cash (20%).   Ms. Cohen expects bonds to outperform stocks in 1991, butshe doesn't expect the bond rally to continue much further.However, she acknowledges, &quot;It is possible that bond yieldscould fall further than we now envision,&quot; which could happen&quot;if the economy is even weaker than we now expect. If so,additional downward pressure on profits would be certain.&quot;   The stocks Goldman is recommending are mostly utilitiesand growth stocks. She says well-managed utilities such asDetroit Edison &quot;make a good deal of sense,&quot; while companiessuch as GTE, considered by some to be a telephone utility,are good bets, too, but not because they're utilities. Withsubstantial parts of their business in cellular telephones,she says, &quot;they really aren't stuffy utilities; they're goodgrowth stocks.&quot;   And while there are the standard growth-stock groups, suchas pharmaceuticals and hospital management, there also aresome growth stocks that haven't done so well lately thatcould be good buys, she says, such as Walt Disney andKellogg. Joseph McAlinden, a market strategist at DillonRead, agrees that for the moment &quot;the long bond is rallyingfor pretty much the same reason the stock market is sagging-- the economy is generally viewed as being in a full-blownrecession.&quot;   But he doesn't agree that a long or severe recession is inthe cards. Indeed, he predicts that in 1991 the total returnfrom stocks will exceed the total return from bonds.   The reason for his optimism: The Middle East crisis is atthe root of what's happening in the financial markets, and&quot;one way or another there is going to be a resolution or atleast a lessening of the crisis atmosphere soon.&quot;   The short-term effect of any such resolution, he suggests,may give bonds another big boost as oil prices fall rapidly,making inflation reports look especially good. But if Mr.McAlinden's thesis is right -- that the Middle East caused acrisis in confidence among consumers and business peoplealike -- then the economy may very well have more momentumthan many analysts suspect. And if such is the case, therecent rapid rate cuts by the Federal Reserve may haveseriously overshot their mark.   &quot;The massive easing that we've seen in the last severalweeks will turn out to be inflationary and a negative forbonds,&quot; he predicts. &quot;By the end of 1991 you could have astock market that has clawed its way back to 3000 or a littlehigher and a long bond that starts inching, but then gainsmore momentum, towards a yield of 9% or higher.&quot;   Mr. McAlinden contends the Middle East crisis hitconsumers and business people twice. First was the suddenrise in oil and gasoline prices as a direct result of Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait. Second was the rapid shift from theeuphoria of peace breaking out in Eastern Europe to thechilling deployment of 400,000 U.S. troops abroad, ready tofight a war.   &quot;Either one of those two would have been a shock toconsumer confidence; together they hit consumers with adouble whammy,&quot; he says.   Now Mr. McAlinden is looking for confidence to stabilizeand, in the wake of whatever resolution of the Middle Eastcrisis occurs, to begin climbing again. That, in turn, willbe reflected in retail sales and finally in stabilizingcommodity prices as business activity picks up again.   &quot;The Middle East is the key,&quot; he says. &quot;If you get aresolution of the Middle East and no bounce back in consumerconfidence, then I'm dead wrong.&quot;   Investors subscribing to Mr. McAlinden's thesis would wantto begin cautiously buying the stocks that will benefit froma rebounding economy, including consumer cyclicals, basicindustrials and capital spending shares.   So far the market is still skeptical. Despite an agreementFriday between the U.S. and Iraq to talk Wednesday, the DowJones Industrial Average fell 7.42 to 2566.09.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Stock prices ended narrowly mixed after a session madevolatile by news about the economy and the Middle Eastcrisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid to a 20-pointloss around noon, but then recovered to more than aneight-point gain when Iraq accepted President Bush'sinvitation for its foreign minister to meet with Secretary ofState James Baker in Geneva.
