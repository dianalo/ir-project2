In the year-earlier quarter, the paper products and information retrieval concern posted net income of $13.2 million, or 42 cents a share.    Sales jumped 46% to $929.1 million from $637.8 million.    Mead's latest quarter's figures include a host of charges, including a charge of $48.7 million, or $1.56 a share, related to its plans to withdraw from the reinsurance business, which has stopped underwriting; a charge of $7.1 million, or 23 cents a share, for the retirement of notes and a charge of $9.3 million, or 30 cents a share, because of the phasing out of the investment tax credit. Offsetting the fourth-quarter charges was a gain of $2.5 million, or eight cents a share, from changes in pension accounting.    On a continuing operations basis, Mead's fourth-quarter net fell to $9.7 million from $14.9 million. In the quarter, Mead said its pulp and paperboard businesses continued to improve. Mead said its outlook is for continued strong markets in pulp and paperboard.    &quot;It's clear from fourth-quarter operating results that we are experiencing growing strength in our markets and operations,&quot; said Burnell Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer.    For the year, Mead's net income fell 61% to $36.3 million, or $1.16 a share, from $93.5 million, or $3.02 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales increased 17% to $3.22 billion from $2.74 billion.    &quot;The stage is set for a very good 1987,&quot; Mr. Roberts said. &quot;Barring any significant downturn in the economy, 1987 earnings should be very strong.&quot;    Mead shares closed yesterday at $69.75, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
