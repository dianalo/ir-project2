SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMSCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> SANTA CLARA, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    3Com Corp. introduced acomparatively inexpensive, yet powerful personal computerwithout disk drives for use in networks that share commondata and programs.   The new desktop computer, called the 3Station, will be priced at $1,895 without a video monitor. The device is compatible with International Business Machines Corp.'s PC AT personal computers, but takes up about half the desk space of the IBM machine. Before it can work, however, the 3Station must be connected to a network that provides the programs and stores and retrieves the data for the device.    &quot;In some circles this machine will be viewed as being somewhat counterrevolutionary,&quot; said Robert M. Metcalfe, 3Com's chairman, conceding that networks using the 3Station will have centralized control over each user's data and programs. &quot;The principal benefit for users, though, is that you don't have to hassle with backing up the information in your machine&quot; and other housekeeping chores necessary to keep a stand-alone machine running, Mr. Metcalfe said. It also provides greater data security, he said.    The 3Station can be connected to its own printer, but can't be modified for special peripheral devices or functions. The keyboard and monitor are the only optional parts that can be configured to suit a customer.    &quot;They don't allow you any options, and that represents a risk for 3Com,&quot; said Stewart Alsop, publisher of PC Letter. &quot;But there are companies that are committed to centralized data processing that now might be more comfortable with this kind of personal computer, because it keeps some control back in the hands of the people in charge of the company's information systems.&quot;    Mr. Alsop said the 3Station's price is &quot;very aggressive.&quot; A conventional personal computer with network capabilities and comparable power, he said, would cost at least $2,500. He said the street price of 3Com's machine will be about $1,500.    Still, the machines will have to be sold as part of existing networks. That means 3Com, which relies on dealers like Businessland Inc. and ComputerLand Corp., will have to count on the dealers to push the new machine instead of an assortment of conventional personal computers and accessories that offer handsome margins.    In over-the-counter trading, 3Com shares closed at $18.875 a share, down $1.25. </TEXT></DOC>
