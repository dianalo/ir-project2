<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0046 </DOCNO><TEXT>A newly erected, three vane, leeward wind power plant with a horizontalrotor axis which has a socalled impact linkage rotor, whose rotor vanesare linked to the hub, was tested. The bending load at the foot of thevane is considerably reduced in this type, so that operation of the rotoron the lee side of the tower without problems is guaranteed. The limitationof power at constant speed occurs due to the breakaway of flow from thevane. During the test phase, a computer-aided multi-channel measuringsystem measured wind speeds at various places of the wind power plant,its electrical output and the mains connection load and the mechanicalload. The measurements showed that the measuring system and the windpower plant worked well, so that further plants of this type (7 m rotorvanes) are planned. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
