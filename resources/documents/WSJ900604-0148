One sentence sums it up: Even Xu Jiatun has run away.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Xu was China's highest-ranking representative herefrom 1983 until early this year. In late April, after his&quot;retirement,&quot; he secretly made his way back to Hong Kong,obtained an American visa and went to California. He wentwithout the consent of Beijing.   As China's top representative here, Mr. Xu had oneall-important duty: Persuade the people of Hong Kong toaccept the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; blueprint for thefuture. It was an uphill battle, but Mr. Xu was convincing.He appealed to people to remain in Hong Kong and called onthose who chose emigration to return after they had obtainedpermanent residency overseas. He insisted that after 1997there would be no change to their freedoms, laws or humanrights. To bolster his assurances, Mr. Xu declared that Chinaitself was now learning from capitalism.   Prior to June 1989, Hong Kong people believed Britain hadnegotiated the colony's return to a China that was opening tothe outside world and undergoing reform, a country that wouldenjoy increasing political and economic liberalization. June4 changed all that; it revealed that Britain had made a pactwith a vicious communist power.   Although China's general policy toward Hong Kong has notchanged in the past year, there has been a disturbing amountof fine-tuning. Take the promise, &quot;Hong Kong people rulingHong Kong.&quot; In both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declarationand the Basic Law (Hong Kong's post-1997 mini-constitution),&quot;Hong Kong people&quot; are defined as those with permanentresidency here. Recently, however, Zhou Nan, Mr. Xu'ssuccessor, added five prescriptive elements to thisdefinition. Hong Kong people must be patriotic, love HongKong, support national reunification, support the Basic Law,and not possess foreign residency status. On anotheroccasion, Chinese officials defined &quot;patriotic&quot; as beingloyal to the present rulers in China.   Mr. Xu used to say that he hoped people with foreignpassports would return to work in Hong Kong. Now, Chineseofficials say that Hong Kong people with full Britishcitizenship, if they reside in Hong Kong after 1997, will beregarded as citizens of China. As such, their right toBritish consular protection will not be recognized.Naturally, this leaves all Hong Kong Chinese with passportsfrom any foreign country with little choice but to quit theterritory before 1997.   Some British parliamentarians have concocted a billwhereby 220,000 Hong Kong people have been granted fullrights of residency in Britain. A Bill of Rights thattheoretically would override other local laws even after 1997has been mooted. Some people even want to accelerate the paceof democratization and establish a democratic system before1997. But none of these gestures has done much to boostconfidence here.   Hong Kong people are convinced things will get worse; butif they could only get some idea of just how much worse, manywould still decide to remain after 1997. If they knew, forexample, that there would be no free press, no free speechand no democracy, but that other freedoms -- such as basichuman rights and the rule of law -- would be preserved, Ibelieve many still would prefer to stay.   Many who aren't in a position to emigrate now aredesperately trying to make as much money as they can so theycan qualify as investment immigrants. In such an atmosphere,extreme greed has become an overriding motivation.   But the greed pales in comparison to personal tales ofpeople who fear for the future and are trying to flee in anyway they can. Lovers in long-term relationships break up,each searching for a partner who can assure a foreignpassport. Families pack aged parents off to old people'shomes, making it easier for them to emigrate. Parents abandonmentally and physically handicapped children, barred by manycountries from immigrating. Far more common are cases ofcouples who have been separated for some time -- one livingand working in Hong Kong while the other waits for permanentresidence status overseas -- finally splitting up.   Hong Kong society is renowned for being law-abiding andstable. Hong Kong business people and professionals areenterprising, daring, inventive and adaptable. Hong Kongworkers are famed for their industriousness, professionalismand level of education. But all of these outstandingqualities have begun to lose their luster now that we live inthe grisly shadow of June 4 and await with fear the prospectsof 1997. The genius of Hong Kong society has nosedived.   One could compare Hong Kong to a seaworthy vessel. Afterthe 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, this ship set coursefor a volcanic island. The volcano was known to be active,but as it had remained dormant for years, many people thoughtit unlikely it would ever erupt again. Those who were lessconfident slipped away silently on small boats, paddling offwith all their might. Then along came the murderous eruptionof June 4. The passengers on the ship no longer have anyconfidence. Disorder is breaking out below decks, and thepassengers are scared that there won't be any lifeboats. Theyfear that long before they reach their destination, the shipwill have been scuttled by its own hands.   ---   Mr. Lee is editor of &quot;The Nineties,&quot; a Hong Kong newsmagazine.
