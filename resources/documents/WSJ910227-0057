While the plan endorses replacing the EC's 12 currencieswith a single one, it tries to bridge the gap betweenadvocates of monetary union and more cautious nations. Germanofficials said the plan theoretically could result in asingle currency before 1997.   But it sets tough conditions for moving forward: lowinflation, budget deficits &quot;that don't endanger stability&quot;and narrower interest-rate differences among member states.Critics said such vaguely defined conditions could delaymonetary union for years.   Germany didn't endorse British plans for a 13th currency,the so-called hard European currency unit, transforming theECU into parallel currency and letting countries decide toadopt it as their national currency. Germany suggestedallowing member states that aren't ready for monetary unionto join later.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIA LIFTS CHINA SANCTIONS                                                                                                          Australia lifted most economic and political sanctions itimposed on China because of the bloody 1989 crackdown inBeijing, citing &quot;discernible improvement&quot; in human rights byChina. The sanctions lifted apply to technical cooperation,agricultural research, financing for development projects,and political visits.                                                                                                          ANTITRUST PENALTIES IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Japan's cabinet approved and sent to Parliament forratification tougher antitrust penalties. The new penaltiesspring from efforts to end bilateral trade friction betweenJapan and the U.S. Tokyo has vowed to tighten itsanti-monopoly law, cut back its protection of small shops andboost public spending. Companies selling goods in violationof the antitrust law now can be fined 0.5% to 2% of theillegal revenue. The new measure raises those levies to 1% to6%, and the minimum fine to 500,000 yen ($3,744) from 200,000yen.

In what was billed as the firstannual state of the nation address in Parliament, Mr. Romanblasted government critics and opponents of pricederegulation.   &quot;Liberalization must be complete because the economy mustwake up . . . there are no miracles,&quot; Mr. Roman said, addingthat he has had to &quot;cross a desert of lies, calumny,demagoguery and opportunism&quot; since taking office in theDecember 1989 revolution that toppled the Communist dictatorNicolae Ceausescu.   &quot;We are in a profound state of economic crisis,&quot; Mr. Romansaid. Faced with an energy shortage, a lack of foreigncapital and labor protests, he is struggling to redraw thecommand economy along Western, capitalist lines. Since therevolution, consumption has increased but industrial outputhas slipped 20%. Subsidies on most basic foodstuffs will beremoved after April. But price rises on certain staples willbe limited. Prices rose an average of 50% between Novemberand January.   Mr. Roman also outlined plans to modernize antiquatedindustry, widen privatization, make the national currencyconvertible, and boost foreign exchange reserves.
