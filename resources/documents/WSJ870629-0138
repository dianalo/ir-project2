An appeals court in Washington ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to &quot;explain its rationale&quot; for the formula under which Middle South's four operating units were ordered to pay for the plant.    The court order could open up another round of bitter disputes among Middle South units, but a Middle South spokesman said the tersely worded order, received Friday, leaves many questions unanswered. Among those questions are whether the FERC must hold rehearings and whether a new cost-allocation plan must be submitted to the federal court for approval.    A revised plan could throw past rate increases into serious scrutiny and bring a new round of problems with state regulatory agencies. As state rate-making authorities two years ago balked at allowing rate increases in accordance with the FERC formula, Middle South came perilously near seeking creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. But the rate raises were reluctantly granted.    The appeal to the circuit court was undertaken by the Mississippi attorney general, the Mississippi Public Service Commission and the city of New Orleans. New Orleans-based Middle South serves a wide area of the South Central U.S.    The controversial FERC cost-sharing plan was issued two years ago as Middle South's own subsidiaries were battling to foist the largest possible share of Grand Gulf's cost onto one another.    Under the FERC formula, 36% of the plant's costs are to be paid by Arkansas Power andamp; Light Co.; 14% by Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co.; 33% by Mississippi Power andamp; Light Co.; and 17% by New Orleans Public Services Inc.    The Grand Gulf unit is 90% owned by Systems Energy Resources Inc., another Middle South unit.    &quot;It took three years of hearings and rehearings to work out this plan,&quot; said the Middle South spokesman. &quot;I hope they can settle it quicker than that this time,&quot; he said.    The spokesman pointed out that the federal appeals court affirmed that the FERC had jurisdiction to determine the cost-sharing formula.    The cost-allocating is a particularly thorny political problem in Mississippi, where controversy over the need for Grand Gulf -- one of the world's largest nuclear plants - still flourishes two years after Grand Gulf went into commercial operation. A second nuclear unit near Port Gibson has been mothballed after Middle South spent nearly $1 billion toward its construction.    Middle South's Mississippi Power andamp; Light unit also recently received a major setback, when the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the unit had been improperly granted a rate increase of $326 million two years earlier. With the Mississippi unit claiming that it faced insolvency because of the ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court last month temporarily preserved the rate increase until the issue could be heard. The Mississippi unit contributed 17% of Middle South's 1986 revenue of $3.49 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
