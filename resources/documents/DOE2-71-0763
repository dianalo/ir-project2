Unfortunately, during aorticsurgery, major haemodynamic changes are inevitable; for instance, thesystemic vascular resistance increases by nearly 50% during aortic crossclamping. Therefore, it is not surprising that myocardial failure accountsfor 50% of the deaths following abdominal aortic surgery. Preoperativemyocardial function can be assessed by a number of methods includingright heart catheterization, echocardiography, digital subtraction angiography,and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography. In this chapter, the evaluationof noninvasive global ventrical function by radionuclide angiocardographyis described.</TEXT></DOC>
