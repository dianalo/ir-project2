With initialing of a tentative treaty with the South Koreansearlier this month, the United States has now concluded scientificmonitoring and enforcement agreements with the three nations thathave North Pacific drift net fleets.   But the State Department doesn't want to consider an outright banuntil scientists have had time to asses data that will be collectedunder the new agreements with Korea, Japan and Taiwan.   ``It would be premature for the U.S. government to announce apolicy of seeking to ban drift nets,'' Ed Wolfe, the StateDepartment's ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said in aninterview.   More than 50 House members, however, have signed on tolegislation that would essentially direct the secretary of state toseek immediately an international ban and provide Congress in sixmonths with a list of the nations that refused to negotiate.   ``It's time for action,'' said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., theprincipal sponsor of the bill. ``We don't need more studies.''   Pressure to seek an international end to the use of drift nets iscoming from two groups: U.S. fishermen who believe the high seascatch has already depleted U.S. salmon and steelhead stocks, andenvironmentalists who believe the nets cause indiscriminateslaughter of marine life.   The lighweight monofilament nets, which environmentalists havelikened to ``walls of death,'' can stretch for more than 30 miles,snaring any animal that comes in contact. On any given day, the netscan cover an estimated 30,000 miles of ocean.   More that 700 vessels from Japan, Taiwan and Korea have beenusing drift nets in the North Pacific ostensibly to catch squid. ButU.S. fishermen say the foreign fleets have served as a ``front'' forthe illegal harvest of up to 30,000 metric tons of salmon andsteelhead worth roughly $30 million.   Fishermen also believe that foreign trawlers using drift nets arecatching large quantities of albacore tuna in the South Pacific.   In addition to the North and South Pacific, drift nets are nowbeing used by fishermen in the Mediterranean Sea.   Environmentalists say use of the drift nets results in the``methodical destruction'' of thousands of marine mammals, sea birdsand other marine life every year.   A Commerce Department study released in May said there was reasonfor ``serious concern'' about the incidental catch of marinemammals, especially northern fur seals, but it did not give anyestimates.   The report did estimate the nets could potentially snare severalhundred thousand seabirds annually.   U.S. observers will be allowed on drift net vessels from Taiwan,Korea and Japan under the new treaties and hopefully will be able tocollect enough data through the end of the 1990 fishing treaty toadequatetly assess the impact such harvesting.   Under international law, anadromous fish such as salmon andsteelhead belong to the nation in which they originated. Japan,Korea and Taiwan also have their own laws regulating where and whentheir drift net fleets can fish and prohibiting the taking of salmonon the high seas.   Wolfe said he expected that the drift net issue will eventuallyhave to be adressed on an international level.   ``It's my opinion that because of the severity of the problem,the intensity of the problem and the interest at the highest levelof our government that the drift net issue will have to be pursuedin a multilateral forum,'' said Wolfe.   Unsoeld said she may try to tack her proposed legislation onto abill reauthorizing the so-called Magnuson Fishing Act when it comesbefore the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in the nextweek or so.</TEXT></DOC>
