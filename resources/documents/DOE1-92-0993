The method is based on the use of generallyavailable sampling instruments (ZMP-01), alpha detectors (RP-23) andAFPC filters. When the samples have been taken it is possible to makeseveral measurements of the filter's alpha activity and thus to detectthe specific activity of the different radon daughters. This method hasbeen used to detect changes in the concentration of latent energy inthe outer ambient atmosphere over a period of one year, or one day. Annualvariations are represented graphically. Minimal values range within 30MeV/l, with maximums reaching the order of 10/sup 3/ MeV/l. Of the dailyvariations the highest concentrations of latent energy were recordedin the morning hours. Measurements were made in the surroundings of thewaste bank of a former pit where mining had been terminated more than10 years previously, at the foot of the waste bank of a mine where mininghad been terminated shortly before the measurement and in the environsof a mine which is still in operation. The results of the measurementsare tabulated. Samples were also taken from the mud pit. Measurementswere also made in several other places in Czechoslovakia. The resultsof the measurements are tabulated. (E.S.). 8 tabs., 9 figs., 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
