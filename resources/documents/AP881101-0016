Reagan commented Monday on the videotape of Anderson that wasreleased in Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers.   ``I don't think that was Terry speaking,'' the president saidafter a bill-signing ceremony in a hotel ballroom. ``I think he hada script that was given to him.''   ``When I was given a script, I always read the lines,'' theformer movie actor said to laughter in the room sprinkled with filmluminaries.   Hollywood executives and such stars as Charlton Heston and CydCharisse had come to watch Reagan sign a copyright bill affectingthe entertainment industry.   Reporters, however, zeroed in on Anderson's taped statementsthat the administration thwarted efforts for the release of thehostages and that Vice President George Bush had bargained withterrorists during the Iran-Contra affair and the 1985 hijacking ofa TWA airliner on a Middle East flight.   ``There's never been any interference, nor have we ever beennegotiating any more than we would with any other kind of kidnapperon a ransom type of basis,'' the president said.   Asked specifically whether Bush, now the Republican candidatefor president, was involved in the TWA talks, the president said,``George has been a part of everything that we've accomplished ...but in a constructive way, and that's why he's my choice in thecoming election.''   When asked if this meant Bush was involved in all his decisionson the Iran-Contra affair ``which wound up in a scandal,'' thepresident replied:   ``Well, there was no scandal. That scandal ... I'm afraid hasbeen artificially created by a media that I cannot understand....''   The president completed the sentence by saying that hisadministration sought to find out the facts ``the minute the newsbroke and the operation was exposed.''   ``And I am still asking, after 10 months of a congressionalinvestigation _ I still don't know who delivered the weapons andwhere the money came from,'' Reagan said.   Bush, asked during an interview with NBC anchor Tom Brokaw aboutAnderson's statement, said: ``I had no role that you are aware ofor are not aware of, absolutely. So I don't know what he's, whatthat refers to.''   Anderson, 41, the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, was kidnapped by the Islamic Jihad on March 16,1985. He is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages in Lebanon.Nine are Americans.   Copies of the 2-minute, 35-second tape were delivered to twoWestern news agencies in Beirut four days after Anderson marked hisfourth birthday in captivity.   ``I have been very close to being released several times overthe past three years, but each time it seems that the U.S.government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I don'tunderstand this,'' Anderson said on the tape.   ``I am not asking Reagan to deal with terrorists, although Mr.Bush did so in the Iran-Contra affair and TWA hijacking,'' he said.   Reagan said ``any information'' Anderson has must come from hiscaptors.   ``You have to recognize that no hostage is taking something uponhimself,'' he said. ``They're telling him what to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
