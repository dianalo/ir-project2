A close associate of Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, tried to kill himselfwhile under interrogation and arrest warrants were issued for fiveother people in the growing scandal.   ``He keeps denying all charges, passing the buck to hissubordinates, but it would not work. We have enough evidence,''senior prosecutor Lee Chong-chan said of Chun.   Twelve hours after questioning, prosecutors gave no indicationwhether he would be put under formal arrest. Officials had saidMonday he was not likely to be released.   Prosecutors said their initial investigation indicated Chunembezzled or otherwise pocketed the equivalent of $14 millionbelonging to the Saemaul (New Community) Movement, which he headedfor seven years.   The semi-official organization is dedicated to urban and ruraldevelopment. Chun Kyung-hwan was its director from 1981 until heresigned last year after reports that he had links with theunderworld.   According to the prosecutors, he is suspected of using the moneyallegedly taken from Saemaul for such purposes as speculation inland and stocks.   Legal experts say charges being contemplated in the case couldresult in more than five years in prison if Chun is convicted.   Chun was summoned by prosecutors Tuesday morning for questioningabout allegations that he abused power to get government funds forSaemaul and cash donations from business executives.   When Chun arrived at the prosecutor general's office, a manrushed from the crowd yelling an insult, hit him in the face andfled.   A ranking official of Saemaul, Hwang Hung-sik, 37, made twosuicide attempts during interrogation, once by trying to jump froma fifth-floor window, officials reported.   Hwang is accused of keeping secret ledgers on transactionsinvolving money Chun allegedly embezzled.   About 200 government officials and business executives have beenquestioned about allegedly helping Chun either to amass a fortuneor cover up the activity.   Opposition parties demanded Tuesday that the former presidentcut short a trip to the United States and state whether he wasinvolved in the scandal.   Chun Doo-hwan was succeeded last month by Roh Tae-woo, who wonthe presidential election in December.   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with militarybacking in 1980, has promised to root out and end officialcorruption.</TEXT></DOC>
