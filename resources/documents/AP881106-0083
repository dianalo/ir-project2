The magazine said other hot stuff for 1988 included:   _Upscale pet paraphernalia, including designer dog and catclothing, gourmet pet food and perfumed groomings;   _Trendy foods like cheese-flabvored popcorn and fancy peppers;   _Black market saguaro cactuses, illegally dug up and replanted aslawn decorations in the Southwest;   _Increased use of Retin A skin wrinkle treatment by youngerconsumers;   _Disposable extended-wear contact lenses;   _Belt pouches, used by skiers, cyclists and, increasingly, citypedestrians;   _Technological devices such as home fax machines, electronicstill cameras that can play back snapshots on the television screenand voice mail corporate telephone answering systems that directcalls and record messages.   _Scientific journals;   _Adult literacy programs;   _Computer security systems.   Adweek also said the year featured a number of retro-trendssparked by nostalgia-fueled baby boomers. Those included Mr. PotatoHead toys, Harley Davidson motorcycles and accessories, charmbracelets, yo-yos, pink flamingos, convertible cars, seamedstockings and garter belts, and a resurgence in train travel.</TEXT></DOC>
