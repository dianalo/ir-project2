Fears are mounting that themarket either has begun a &quot;correction&quot; of 10% or more, orthat one is imminent. That's driving a growing number ofinvestors to look for ways to shore up their portfolios'defenses. And if prices are any indication, they're loadingup on utilities and energy stocks. Many analysts say thisstrategy is precisely right for the circumstances.</LP><TEXT>   A four-day, 76-point slump in the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage in the opening days of October spooked many investorswho already were nervous enough about high stock prices in asickly economy. Was it merely another of the many slips thathave held prices in a narrow trading range since last winter?Or was it the prelude of a more serious slump?   &quot;I think historically it will look like the first phase ofa correction,&quot; says Joseph McAlinden, chief stock strategistat Dillon Read. &quot;It will look like the market was just tiredand richly priced and began drifting downward.&quot;   Mr. McAlinden is predicting, however, that the slide willsoon pick up momentum. He agrees that all the market'smuch-discussed problems set the decline into motion: highvaluations, low cash levels at institutional investors, heavyinsider selling, and last, but not least, the superstitiousfear of the seasonal factor.   &quot;The fall months tend to be tough on stocks, especially inpre-election years,&quot; he says. In looking at the 11pre-election years going back to the late 1940s, Mr.McAlinden found that in 10 of those years stock prices werelower at the end of October than they were at the summerhighs.   But he has a surprising theory about what will acceleratethe drop in stock prices: stronger economic growth.   &quot;I think it's going to be good news on the economy thatprecipitates the big drop,&quot; he predicts. &quot;I realize thatargument is unique to me, but I think what is going to happenis basically the opposite of what happened this summer.&quot;   This summer, he says, the stock market perversely rose inresponse to bad economic news. &quot;The conventional wisdom wasthat weak economic data meant further Federal Reserve easing&quot;of interest rates, &quot;and the lower rates were good forstocks,&quot; he explains.   But if, as he predicts, economic data begin to improve incoming weeks, the good news will drive stocks down. &quot;I happento believe that the recovery is progressing and that the datais going to turn just a little bit stronger,&quot; he says. &quot;Itwill be just enough to dash hopes for an endless stream offurther Fed easing, but not enough to lift earnings in theshort term.&quot; The result could be a stock-price drop of morethan 10% from the August high of 3050 on the Dow industrials.   Among the safest places to weather this storm, Mr.McAlinden says, is in utility and energy stocks, specificallynatural gas stocks. &quot;Historically, natural gas distributionstocks have been one of the safest havens in fallcorrections,&quot; he asserts. One reason is that there's aseasonal bias to their earnings, with prices and earningsrising with the onset of colder weather.   Peter Canelo, the market strategist for County NatWest,has a more conventional view of the market and its short-termprospects. He doesn't think a steep slide is imminent, but heisn't expecting the economy to rebound, either.   &quot;It's a tricky period,&quot; he says. &quot;I think the market isprobably just going to hold the bottom of the trading rangearound the mid-2800 area&quot; of the Dow industrials.   By Mr. Canelo's calculation, the stock market has alreadyundergone a correction of sorts. He points out that whilebond prices have risen sharply in the past several months,stock prices haven't.   &quot;In other words, stocks should have done better and bygoing nowhere in the great bond market rally, they werealready reflecting the fear and loathing of bad earningsreports,&quot; he says.   But he doesn't think prices will drop a lot further soon.&quot;One reason I don't expect a big decline is that investorsdon't have anywhere else to go,&quot; he says. &quot;Interest rates areso low that cash is an unattractive option, bonds have comeabout as far as they're going to come, and you can forgetreal estate.&quot;   Despite his prediction that a big correction isn'tlooming, Mr. Canelo nevertheless suggests that oil andutility stocks would be comfortable places to wait for eventsto play out.   &quot;It makes good investment sense to go to oil,&quot; he says.&quot;November crude is up to $23 a barrel, the highest level ineight or nine months. It's one area where prices are actuallymoving up and earnings may be living up to or even exceedingexpectations.&quot;   He also makes a case for utilities, especially the BabyBells. &quot;They have good yields compared to bonds, and thefundamentals for the Bell operating companies are turningaround. Mean Judge Green is relenting and allowing them todiversify their business,&quot; he says.   There are, of course, analysts who believe that adefensive posture isn't warranted at all. &quot;The problems inthe stock market are temporary,&quot; says Abby Joseph Cohen, astrategist at Goldman Sachs. &quot;The risks of a significantdecline in the market as a whole from these levels aren'tvery great.&quot;   Ms. Cohen contends that while investors are disappointedby third-quarter earnings, stock prices are actually lowcompared with profit expectations. Based on various valuationmodels used by Goldman Sachs, she says the overall market isabout 5% undervalued compared with the extreme of 20%overvaluation that the market hits in its peaks. And whileinvestors may be disappointed with third-quarter earnings,she maintains that a profit recovery is about to begin.Investors simply need to be cautious about what stocks theyown.   &quot;There's no question that a new profit cycle is about tobegin,&quot; she says. &quot;What you need to do is to focus oncompanies that will do well in a moderate growth economy.&quot;That means, for the most part, the kind of growth stocks thathave dominated the market for the past five years. Taking adefensive posture with utility stocks isn't necessary, shesays, and for the most part cyclical stocks aren't appealing,either.   &quot;The more economically sensitive companies are at risk,&quot;she says, &quot;because consensus expectations are much too high.We're not saying this is going to be the most energeticrecovery you've ever seen. Economic growth will be moderate,but that's the kind of environment that suits the stockswe're recommending best.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Stocks posted narrow gains in light trading with manymarket players distracted by explosive testimony over JudgeClarence Thomas's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.   Law Professor Anita Hill testified about alleged sexualharassment by Judge Thomas before a nationally broadcastSenate Judiciary Committee hearing.   While the developments had little impact on share prices,it did keep many in vestors from paying attention to themarket. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 146,560,000shares, down sharply from Thursday's 164,120,000 shares.   &quot;I think it was a case of CNN-itis,&quot; said Robert S.Robbins, technical analyst at Robinson-Humphrey. &quot;It remindsme of the Persian Gulf War,&quot; he added, referring to America'sobsession with live war coverage via Cable News Networkduring the conflict with Iraq earlier this year.   But analysts said investors are also suffering fromwidespread fear of a market disaster in the month made famousby the 1987 crash and the 1989 mini-crash.   Mr. Robbins noted that the market ignored economic reportsearlier Friday that showed both moderating inflation and amild increase in economic activity. The two are normallyimportant ingredients for a strong stock market.   &quot;People are getting incredibly cautious or bearish in whatseems to me to be an incredibly bullish situation,&quot; he said.   The session was choppy, with share prices crisscrossing anarrow band for most of the day.   Stocks ended near their highs for the day, with the DowJones Industrial Average increasing 7.16 points to 2983.68.Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index added 0.90 point to 381.45,the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.52 to210.07, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.79 pointto 357.36.   Ralph Blair, partner on the institutional trading desk atMontgomery Securities, said the huge volume of new stockissues flooding the market has also helped sapped interest inthe rest of the market.   New stock accounted for about nine million shares, or morethan 6%, of Friday's Big Board trading volume.   Other traders said volume was relatively light becausemany market players will be absent today for the Columbus Dayholiday, even though stock exchanges will be open.</TEXT></DOC>
