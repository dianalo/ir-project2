 Many of them are an outgrowth of the very market forces alreadylisted: for example, open systems and interoperable platforms.andM;One additional tool that will significantly contribute to the progression ofsystem integration is database standards, particularly &quot;data about data&quot;standards, or data dictionary standards.andP;  In fact, the term &quot;data dictionary&quot;is already being obliterated by &quot;repository.&quot;andM;This actually represents more than simply a name change, as the datadictionary concept is to a repository as a lightning bug is to lightning.andO;The repository, as fostered by IBM, represents a quantum leap in control, notonly of databases, integrated systems, and application portability, butexpanding to potential management of the entire enterprise itself.andP;  It willalso serve as a catalyst for unifying corporate information resources.andM;Technology initiatives such as Case and relational databses will usedictionary and repository tools to integrate their markedly diversefunctions.andP;  The use of these tools will play an important role in the verysurvival of corporate entities as they progress through the next decade.andM;Most forward-looking organizations will use their information systems asstrategic weapons in the battle for dominance and continuity, which exist inany market economy.andP;  Successful companies will adopt the best resourcesavailable to build their functional applications.andP;  Certainly, one of the keyelements to this approach is a central data archive and operational model formuch of the corporation's business.andM;As related by George Schussel, president of Digital Consulting Inc., Andover,Mass., &quot;The intersection of computer-aided software engineering, databasetechnologies, and automated application generation will be the repository.andO;This new technology promises to play a vital role in driving new methods ofapplication development in the 1990s.&quot;andP;  More companies are likely to seek acompetitive edge by exploiting state-of-the-art application developmenttechnologies, he suggested.andM;Currently, there are three major approaches to the implementation of acentralized data model.andP;  The IBM Repository Manager's system is one of thoseapproaches.andP;  It will develop and evolve over many years, much like SystemsNetwork Architecture (SNA) has from the 1970s.andM;According to Schussel, IBM's Repository will &quot;revolutionize applicationdevelopment.andP;  There won't be programmers writing code anymore.&quot;andM;He foresees IBM's Repository as among the most complex products everdeveloped by IBM.andP;  He is so convinced of its profound impact that he advisesorganizations to begin using a data dictionary now, even if it is only aninterim product.andM;IBM states that its Repository Manager does not now comply with the IRDSstandard, but compliance is on IBM's agenda.andP;  Jim Archer, director ofIntegrated Development Environments for IBM's Santa Teresa Laboratory, SanJose, Calif., reports that &quot;IBM already supports some portions of the IRDSstandard, and we will be working toward full compliance in the future.&quot;andM;No specific timetable was given for this compliance, but like open systems inthe world of networks, IBM no longer ignores these user-driven trends.andM;STEPS FOR EFFICIENCYandM;There are five major steps promulgated by repository-watchers that must beundertaken in order to achieve effective usage:andM;* analyze and understand people-problems within an organization that candelimit efficient implementation;andM;* prepare a plan that analyzes repository impact upon the overallorganization, the various functional departments, and at the data modelplanning level itself;andM;* collect all data requirements appropriate to the enterprise, including dataclustering and aggregation patterns;andM;* based on the preceding steps, create an integrated design that will beusable by the various strategic computing systems; andandM;* implementing the central repository and accompanying tool sets in a modularfashion, perhaps proceeding one functional area at a time.andM;Failure to properly complete any of these steps in a thorough manner may leadto ultimate failure.andM;DEC's COMMON DATA DICTIONARYandM;Yet another major repository approach is the Common Data Dictionary + (CDD +)from Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  Building on its networking and standard userinterface approach, DEC envisions its dictionary/repository as a furtherextension of its unified approach to end-user functionality.andM;It views CDD + as a global data model essential to a distributed environmentand its multitude of software tools.andP;  In othe words, DEC's conceptualapproach is similar to that of IBM.andM;An integrated Case capability is at the core of both IBM and DEC strategicinitiatives -- and the repository is the megaproduct that will support thatinitiative.andM;Wendy Herman, DEC's repository product manager, declares, &quot;Users now want anactive, not passive data dictionary -- a fact that will make it particularlyimportant to developers.andM;&quot;The evolutionary history of our CDD + traces back to 1981,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Ithas gone through changes in the ensuing years, culminating in the firstrelease of CDD + in August 1988.andP;  There have since been two minor updates.andM;&quot;CDD + is an entity relationship model, all entries are objects.andP;  It operatesabove the operating system, not as part of it.andP;  Presently, CDD + functionswithin a VMS environment, although future plans call for adding Ultrix andadditional platforms to this scenario.&quot;andM;Herman also offered that CDD + supports a distributed data dictionaryimplementation.andM;&quot;The user can partition the dictionary in accordance with practical businessrequirements.andP;  Physically, it can have many segments in place, but logicallyit remains one.andP;  Definitions in one location can be based on definitionssituted elsewhere,&quot; she asserts.andM;&quot;We feature an open dictionary product.andP;  Interfaces have been published foruse by others, and we anticipate escalating integration of independentsoftware vendor products, along with appropriate DEC platforms,&quot; statesHerman.andP;  &quot;We are also strong in IRDS standards work, and when compliancetests become available, DEC will pursue that avenue.andP;  As it is, CDD + followsIRDS pretty closely.&quot;andM;For the future, Herman foresees DEC seeking increased integration of ISV andDEC platforms within the CDD + environment.andP;  Case products are of particularimportance.andM;Adherence to standards is another priority.andM;&quot;CDD + has a bright future and a long evolutionary path before it.andP;  Fromobject-oriented interfaces to other similar technology advances, CDD + willcontinue to grow,&quot; Herman stressed.andM;A potential weakness in the DEC effort is a smaller mass of third-partydevelopers who supply much of the tools necessary to effectively utilize arepository, compared to the cast assembled by IBM.andP;  No single entity, noteven IBM, can realistically expect to generate the millions of lines of codenecessary to implement a repository just in the support tools area alone.andO;This explains IBM's feverish liaisons with dozens of development firms topush ahead DB2, along with its companion repository system.andM;CDD + currently operates under VMS and will need to extend to Ultrix foruniversal applicability.andP;  DEC's effort, like IBM's, will take years ofongoing development.andM;A general overview of DEC's repository and user interface strategy revealsthree major elements: Network, Repository, and Common User Interface.andP;  Allcritical to DEC's evolving Case effort (see Figure 1).andM;COULD IRDS WIN IN THE END?andM;The third major approach in the meta-data management world is the InformationResource Dictionary System (IRDS), a developing standard which perhapsrepresents the most significant of these efforts over the long term.andM;IRDS is at a stage of acceptance similar to the X.25 networking standardduring its early years -- welcomed, but not widely implemented.andP;  Like X.25,however, it has powerful forces behind it which will help in gaining a largebody of adherents.andM;Mohan Prabandham, consulting manager at CGI Systems, McLean, Va., ad X3H4chair for the IRDS Reference Model Task Group, said he has not seen&quot;commercial products for the standard yet.andP;  But the standards are very new.andM;&quot;There are many existing products that must evolve to IRDS, as well as newones yet to be released,&quot; he said.andP;  IRDS was issued as a Federal InformationProcessing Standard (Fips) only in March 1989.andM;An 18-month &quot;grace period&quot; follows before Fips is implemented in procurementdecisions.andP;  &quot;We are still in an interim period,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;IRDS will serve as a common platform for all corporate data, a central pointof control.andP;  It will feature support for Case, object-oriented design, dataadministration tools, distributed and networked environments, and become thefocal point for information resource management.andP;  It will also maintain itsdynamic nature, changing through the years to reflect contemporaryrequirements,&quot; Prabandham emphasized.andM;IRDS DATES TO 1980andM;In 1980, two organizations recognized the need for some degree ofstandardization for data dictionaries.andP;  One organization was the NationalBureau of Standards, now known as the National Institute of Standards andTechnology (NIST).andP;  The other was the American National Standards Institute(Ansi) and its X3H4 committee.andP;  NIST began work at that time on a Fips fordata dictionary systems.andM;These two groups proceeded independently until 1983, when X3H4 decided toadopt the draft version Fips specification for all subsequent work.andP;  Fromthat time onward, Ansi and NIST teams labored together to formulate an IRDSdocument.andM;In addition to the officially released Ansi standard, a corresponding effortby the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is in theformative and planning stages; the first product is due next year.andP;  Someobservers feel this date is unrealistic.andM;Bruce Rosen of NIST acknowledges that some confusion surrounds ISO'sframework document.andP;  &quot;It is  plan, not a standard.andP;  There is no available ISOstandard at this time, whereas the Ansi product is published and can beimplemented now,&quot; he explained.andM;&quot;ISO directions are different, also.andP;  Ansi's IRDS serves as a dataadministration tool.andP;  It was built with heavy input from data administratorsand other appropriate users,&quot; Rosen said.andP;  &quot;ISO, on the other hand, iscreating a dictionary for relational databases with SQL.andP;  They appear to relymore heavily on standards -- rather than encompassing input from users.andM;One of the areas of impetus for IRDS is the Application Portability Profile(APP) being developed and vigorously promoted by NIST.andP;  APP is an assemblageof tools designed to aid the cause of applications portability (see Figure2).andP;  It continues to expand as NIST sanctions additions based on a product'sacceptance in the marketplace or as an official standard.andM;IRDS is firmly entrenched within APP.andP;  As NIST implements the full packagethroughout the federal establishment, procuring government agencies willrequire acquiescence to its provisions in their system purchase actions.andO;Gosip, for example, becomes a mandatory network requirement in all governmentacquisitions beginning August 1990.andM;TCP/IP EXPERIENCE A MODEL?andM;This type of coercion by the world's largest computer buyer eventuallyimpacts the entire marketplace.andP;  The TCP/IP experience is an example.andM;In the early '80s it was a relatively obscure network protocol grouping usedby Arpanet.andP;  When that design was adopted by the Defense Data Network servingthe Department of Defense, TCP/IP rose quickly in acceptance.andP;  It iscurrently the dominant protocol suite for multi-vendor networks.andM;Similar experiences can be expected with other APP vehicles, such as IRDS.andO;Vendors will build products when they see sufficient opportunity to sellthose products.andM;The challenge in developing IRDS specifictions was to create a standarddictionary model powerful enough to replace a variety of proprietary systems,yet flexible enough to permit partial, but conformant, implementation of thatmodel.andM;With a standard IRDS, all information resource descriptions can be placed ina single dictionary/repository, and can be accessed by all system developmenttools.andM;To support this capability, IRDS offers two critical features not present inproprietary packages, except in a limited manner.andP;  First, the design of IRDSis fully extensible.andP;  If requirements for new information resourcedefinitions are suddenly identified, they can be immediately appended to theexisting structure.andM;Second, a programming interface will be added to the aggregate of interfacespresent in the IRDS standard.andP;  In effect, the dictionary/repository itselfbecomes a database to this program interface.andP;  Thus, it can be queried andupdated much like any other database.andM;IRDS can support any system development and operational life cycle that auser wishes to define.andP;  The very first step in Strategic Systems Planningtypically would be applied to the entire enterprise, or at least asignificant component of that overall entity (see Figure 3).andP;  This provides abasis for subsequent integration across various system development projectsvia global dictionary and database design.andP;  The use of adictionary/repository facility at this stage serves as a lever for integrateddesign throughout all subsequent development steps.andM;IRDS FUNCTIONAL MODULESandM;The initial release of the IRDS standard had five functional modules.andP;  Eachof these five modules interfaces with the Core, but is independent.andP;  Thus, animplementor of the standard can select the Core plus one or more of thefunctional modules deemed appropriate to the requirements.andP;  No one has to usemodules not applicable for their needs.andM;The Core module contains basic capabilities most commonly needed by users.andO;Additional modules possess functions such as:andM;* a beginning set of dictionary data structures;andM;* a security facility;andM;* a life-cycle management methodology package;andM;* a facility for defining and executing procedures composed of IRDS commands;andandM;* an application programming interface allowing user-written programs toexecute IRDS commands.andM;Within the Core, IRDS contains specifications for three interfaces to itscontents.andP;  A Command Language interface defines the specific commandsavailable to access IRDS information resources.andP;  The menu-driven Panelinterface aids in supporting interactive processing by inexperienced users.andM;Lastly, an IRD-IRD interface facility specifies a data interchange format fortransfer of information among IRDS implementations.andM;Technical Committee X3H4 and National Institute of Standards and Technologyhave identified additional modules that will further enhance IRDScapabilities in the intermediate and long term.andP;  Among them are support fordistributed databases and network directory functions, SQL database languagestandards in the area of data definition languag, further standardization ofdata elements, and support for data structure and procedure definitions asfound in Cobol, C, Ada, Fortran, and PL/1.andM;The impact of IRDS on existing and new dictionary/repository products hasonly just begun.andP;  By the end of the new decade, every product in themarketplace will be compliant with at least the Core Module segment of thestandard, and most will adhere to a larger portion of the totalspecification.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
