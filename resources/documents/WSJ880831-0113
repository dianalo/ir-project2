Not exactly. The governors who run our states and the mayors who run our towns have a slightly different view of the American political system. When they look toward Washington, D.C., many of them see only one party -- the National Beltway Party.    The National Beltway Party is a Congress that passes laws, rules, reporting requirements and mandates the states must obey. A lot of local leaders are fed up with the National Beltway Party, so fed up, in fact, that at the governors' annual meeting in Cincinnati recently they discussed amending the U.S. Constitution to liberate them from Washington.    The war between the states and Washington hasn't received a lot of attention, but it explains why many people now feel that large areas of public administration in the U.S. have bogged down or ceased to function effectively. Specifically the governors complained, in a position brief, of &quot;congressional pre-emption of state authority in such areas as banking, communications, transportation, and corporate governance, and the continued micromanagement of state affairs through the regulatory process.&quot;    &quot;Congress can't deal with the deficit,&quot; says an official with the National Governors' Association, &quot;so they end up doing a lot of micromanaging of the states.&quot; Virtually every federal program now includes specific participation rates for defined minorities. Job-training money even specifies parts of states in which it must be spent. An individual governor's flexibility in administering the programs Congress creates is minimal, but the state's reporting requirements back to Washington are overwhelming.    The governors say there are a number of jobs that state governments could do better than the federal government, but federal rules prevent them from doing so. New Hampshire Governor John Sununu says his state would prefer home care for the elderly infirm rather than institutionalization. &quot;Yet,&quot; he says, &quot;through constraining mandates and requirements, the federal government has taken the authority over such local questions away from the states.&quot; New Jersey's Tom Kean cites the welfare mess as &quot;a perfect example of what can happen when a 'distant authority' takes responsibility for an important problem. The federal view of welfare as an income maintenance program, jointly funded but administered by the states, has hampered efforts to move public assistance recipients into jobs.&quot; More than 20 states already have their own welfare-reform programs. Connecticut Governor William O'Neill asks, &quot;Who would expect a U.S. Senator to know when a town road in our state will be paved?&quot;    Many of the governors have concluded that only amending the Constitution will get the weight of Washington off their backs. The amendment idea is likely going nowhere fast, since additions to the Constitution must pass through Congress. The governors, however, say they've been driven to this hapless strategy by recent losses before the Supreme Court, which has essentially said the states' relief lies in the political process. The governors respond that this reduces the states to the level of mere special-interest lobbies, like everyone else in Washington.    So what else is new?    Not many governors whom we can recall complained much during the salad years of federal spending growth, when Washington was ladling out money and programs to the states for every public function from A to Z. Like a lot of other beneficiaries, from the welfare lobby to the defense industry, the name of the game then was &quot;take the money and run.&quot; But Ronald Reagan blew the whistle on this wild party, and the governors, like a lot of other people, are discovering what life is like with a Congress that has virtually no idea what its point or purpose is any longer. Congress is now basically in the micromanagement business, driving everyone crazy with its meddling and then shaking everyone down for campaign contributions.    Virginia Governor Gerald Baliles, the new head of the governors' association, says, &quot;The issue of federalism ought to be placed on the political agenda for 1988, to be thrashed out and fully debated.&quot; Agreed. We'll know, however, that the governors are serious the first time one of them stands up in his or her own state and tells his or her people it is time to start voting out of office a Congress that exists mainly to serve itself. </TEXT></DOC>
