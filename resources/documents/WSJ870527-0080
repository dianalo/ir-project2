Charles phoned two days later, and he was no less excited. &quot;We've got all hell breaking loose here,&quot; he said. &quot;The currencies are going absolutely wild. . . . The metals have become the major target for making money.&quot;    These are heady days for people whose standard of living is tied to telephone selling of commodity futures and options contracts. While these salespeople habitually work the phones, their fingers move faster and pitches grow more insistent when inflation fears jar the markets. And not since 1980 have worries about a new inflationary tide been so widespread.    &quot;The number of calls regarding firms we've never heard of before has increased dramatically over the past few weeks,&quot; says a spokesman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which fields public inquiries and complaints about commodity-brokerage firms. Despite the fact that few novices make money investing in futures and options (and many lose vast sums), commodity telephone sales seem poised for another boom.    To sample the latest in telephone tactics, I became the willing recipient of some 20 sales pitches for commodity futures and options by dialing toll-free numbers and sending in post-paid cards offered by small or obscure firms. While the array of investment vehicles offered has never been wider, pitchmen's techniques don't change, I found. They still try to evoke a sense of urgency and opportunity by using tactics common for decades, from claims of past windfalls to hints of inside information.    The post-paid cards had simple messages like, &quot;Current levels could be cheap,&quot; but the telephone brokers said much more. Some called several times, and talked for as long as there seemed any hope of separating me from my money. They were willing teachers, often telling me to &quot;go get a pencil and paper&quot; so they could explain these complex investments. Most were pushing options, particularly on silver and gold.    A few were refreshingly candid, stating clearly that the investments were risky. When asked, some even admitted they had been in business for only a couple of months or that they actually had clients who lost money.    Others seemed to have less respect for the truth. Here's a sampling of the tactics I endured.    THE HARD SELL: I couldn't see Mark's nose, but it must have been long after his first 30-minute call from Florida.    &quot;What we're dealing with is, the dollar will drop another 8%,&quot; he said, explaining why he was bullish on silver. &quot;That's what James Baker says.&quot; That might have come as a surprise to the Treasury secretary, who six days earlier was trying to calm the markets by talking up stability for the dollar.    Mark had also found something unheard of in financial markets: unanimity among analysts. It seems all of them were saying silver would go to $12 an ounce by the end of May. (With three trading days to go, the metal is at $7.52 an ounce.)    Charles, meanwhile, had the gold bug. On April 29, he said it was going from $454 to $500 within a week. &quot;A lot of serious money is going to be made,&quot; he said.    If serious money has been made, it wasn't from those predictions. Gold finished at about $459 an ounce on May 6, the day by which it was supposed to have hit $500, and closed at about $451 yesterday.    Another salesman, Tim, couldn't understand my hesitation. &quot;Every market is going in our direction,&quot; he proclaimed. What's more, he said, calling back 10 minutes later, every one of his firm's clients had made at least 60% on their money since the beginning of the year.    THE LEADING QUESTION: &quot;If you found a way to make a tremendous profit, and could do it on a limited-risk basis, would you want to take advantage of it right now?&quot; one salesman asked.    Or: &quot;The key to making money is timing and leverage, isn't it?&quot; said another.    THE HOT TIP: One salesman promised access to &quot;classified information&quot; on the markets, which turned out to be analysts' published research reports from two little-known Chicago futures firms.    Others were big on the latest news, informing me in one call that the Federal Reserve had &quot;just added money to the system&quot; and in another that banks had just raised the prime rate.    THE GOOD-OLD-BOY ROUTINE: One broker from California, after putting me on hold, said that practically his whole family lives in my Illinois town, and reeled off street names to prove it.    THE HIGH-TECH COME-ON: Many salesmen promised access to &quot;the latest technology,&quot; most of it at least two decades old. Two of the most popular: computer screens with &quot;up-to-the-minute prices,&quot; and order systems with &quot;direct access to the floor&quot; of the commodity exchanges.    THE OLD AS NEW: One broker was big on stop-loss orders to help control risk. &quot;It costs nothing to do this,&quot; he said, talking as though his firm had a patent on the timeworn practice of placing standing orders to close out a position when losses mounted to a certain level. &quot;It's all in the $100 (commission),&quot; he said. &quot;That's why we're so good.&quot;    He left it to the risk-disclosure statement mailed to my home later to note the pitfalls: Stop-loss orders, the statement noted, &quot;will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.&quot;    NOTES FROM THE FRONT: The same broker put me on hold early in the phone call. &quot;I'm sorry about that,&quot; he said 30 seconds later. &quot;The gold market was just closing. I had to put an order in.&quot;    Seconds later, he was at it again, yelling over the sound of traders' shouts and phones ringing in the background: &quot;Hey Warren! Buy one on the close! One!&quot;    THE BIG-SPENDER ROUTINE: Asked about my liquid assets, I told one caller of the $1,000 in my money-market fund. &quot;Lunch money,&quot; he sniffed. &quot;Believe it or not, I've spent at least that on lunch, a couple of times.&quot;    THE CHANCE-OF-A-LIFETIME LINE: Two salesmen offered to rush new account paperwork via Federal Express. &quot;Any delay at this particular point -- while history is being made -- would be unwise,&quot; said one.    DON'T WORRY, ANY IDIOT CAN DO IT (WITH MY HELP): Most salesmen answered my questions about their track records with anecdotes about customers who made big money on recent trades. One told about an Alabama woman who made $1,275 in options on Japanese yen. What's more, she knew nothing about the investment: &quot;They only know tractor parts&quot; down there, the broker said.    Other pronouncements were equally hard to check, like that of the New York broker who said he was looking for just two new clients. One ex-client had died and another had retired, he explained.    THE GUILT TRIP: &quot;This is supposed to be my dinner time,&quot; said one broker in a 30-minute talk on options. Another promised to be in his office till 10 p.m. should I want to call back.    THE 'ANTIDOTE': Then there was the lawyer whose advertisement told how a working couple lost their life savings &quot;through constant turnover of contracts&quot; (churning) by their broker. The ad went on with a pitch of its own for a free consultation on how to recover investment losses.    &quot;My personal opinion,&quot; said the lawyer, &quot;is that unless you're a floor broker on one of the commodity exchanges, you'd have to have loose marbles to trade in commodities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
