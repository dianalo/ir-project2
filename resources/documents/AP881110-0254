But Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell for the10th straight month from year-earlier levels to $4.83 billion inOctober, down 3.1 percent from $4.98 billion in the previous yearbut up from $4.65 billion in September.   Exports to the United States rose 7.9 percent from a year earlierto $8.34 billion, while imports from the United States climbed 27.7percent to $3.51 billion, the ministry said.   Officials noted major increases in U.S.-bound exports ofsemiconductors and passenger vehicles. Japan's exports ofsemiconductors to the United States jumped 54.7 percent to $314million, while vehicle exports grew 9 percent to $2.47 billion.   Japan's total $7.69 billion trade surplus in October comparedwith $6.8 billion in October 1987 and $7.74 billion this pastSeptember. In August, Japan's trade surplus was $4.94 billion.   Japan's exports during October rose 13.2 percent from a yearearlier to $23.38 billion from $20.66 billion, and imports alsoclimbed 13.2 percent to $15.7 billion.   After rising for 15 months from year-earlier levels, the nation'strade surplus reversed direction in July. This trend raised concernamong officials that the surge could aggravate trade friction.   Finance Ministry officials said weaker imports from SoutheastAsia and lower crude oil prices were the main reasons for thefaster-growing trade surplus. Crude oil prices averaged $11.92 perbarrel in October, down 33 percent from a year earlier.   Japanese customers bought less crude oil in the expectation thata meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries couldfurther reduce global oil prices, the officials said, speakinganonymously. Crude oil imports fell 4.1 percent to $1.17 billion inOctober.   Lower textile products from Southeast Asia boosted Japan'ssurplus with the region to $1.81 billion, more than twice theyear-earlier level.   October's trade surplus exceeded the levels expected by localanalysts and dealers in financial markets.   Exports in October were figured at an average exchange rate of132.04 yen to the dollar, compared to 144.50 yen a year earlier.Imports were pegged at 132.58 yen, versus 144.59 yen.   Japan measures its trade surplus on a customs-clearance basis,which includes freight and insurance costs on imports but not forexports. Its trade surplus would be higher if those costs wereincluded in both categories.</TEXT></DOC>
