Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer William H. Gates embraced a powerful newchip design by Digital Equipment Corp.   Mr. Gates's endorsement is both a boost for Digital and abid by Microsoft to push its operating software intoworkstations and the upper reaches of the computer marketwhere it has no presence today.</LP><TEXT>   The alliance with Digital &quot;could change the equation inthe computer industry,&quot; Mr. Gates said in an interview.   Mr. Gates said Microsoft will work with Digital to offerMicrosoft's next-generation operating system, Windows NT, onDigital's Alpha chip design. Digital unveiled the chipyesterday, saying it would power its computers into the nextcentury.   The Digital-Microsoft alliance had been widely expected.But Mr. Gates's comments were the first public confirmationof what is apparently a widening collaboration. A spokesmanfor Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., said the company is &quot;inserious negotiations&quot; with Microsoft but wouldn't discloseterms. &quot;We aren't there yet,&quot; he said.   Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., apparently hopes tonurture development of a new industry standard in theworkstation market just as its DOS and Windows operatingsoftware define the PC market. &quot;If we can do that, we canchange the industry,&quot; Mr. Gates said. &quot;Digital is a keyelement in this.&quot;   Digital said yesterday that its new chip will be morepowerful than the next-generation chips of Sun MicrosystemsInc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business MachinesCorp. The chip is based on reduced instruction-set computing,or RISC, an advanced chip design.   Digital also said it is in negotiations with othercomputer makers to license the chip. Cray Research Inc. andJapan's Kubota Ltd. have already announced that they will useit in future products.   Competitors have expressed skepticism about Digital'sclaims for the performance of the new chip design. Bill Joy,a senior Sun Microsystems engineer, said the effective powerof the chip will fall short of the peak speeds that Digitalhas disclosed.   Digital said the first version of the Alpha chip,available in volume this summer, will deliver 150 Specmarks,a common measure of computer power. Hewlett-Packard has saidit will deliver a 120 Specmark chip by the end of the year.   In operating software, Microsoft is racing against anadvanced operating system for RISC chips under development byIBM and Apple Computer Inc. under a joint venture calledTaligent. Microsoft is expected to deliver Windows NT by theend of this year, at least a year ahead of the expectedTaligent offering. Microsoft is also trying to supplant Unix,the industry standard operating software developed byAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Unix dominates theworkstation market.   Microsoft's first priority for Windows NT is the hugemarket for PCs built around Intel Corp.'s microprocessors,the highest-volume computer design. It has also said it willmake Windows NT available to a Digital-led consortiumcentered on RISC chips designed by MIPS Computer Systems Inc.   Digital said it will price the first of the new chips at$1,559 for 1,000 or more. Bill Demmer, a Digital vicepresident, said that a range of computers based on the chipwill be available by the end of this year. They will be aimedfirst at power-hungry technical and scientific markets, withcommercial-class software and new models coming six monthslater.</TEXT></DOC>
