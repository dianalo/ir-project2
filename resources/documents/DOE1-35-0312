<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-35-0312 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Advanced Toroidal Facility (ATF) is a magnetic confinement deviceunder construction at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The ATF isa type of stellarator known as a torsatron, which theoretically has thecapability to operate at {ge} 8% beta in steady state. The ATF plasmahas a major radius of 2.1 m, an average minor radius of 0.3 m, and afield of 2 T for 5-s pulses or 1 T steady state. The ATF device consistsof a set of helical field (HT) coils, a set of poloidal field (PF) coils,an exterior shell structure to support the coils, and a thin helicallycontoured vacuum vessel inside the coils. The ATF replaces the ImpurityStudy Experiment (ISX-B) tokamak at ORNL and uses the ISX-B auxiliarysystems, including power supplies, cooling, diagnostics, data acquisition,control, and 4 MW of neutral injection and 0.2 MW electron cyclotronheating. The ATF is scheduled to start commissioning in January 1987.An overview of the ATF device is presented, including details of theconstruction process employed and the present status of this work.</TEXT></DOC>
