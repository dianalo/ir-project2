It is intended to provide resources toeligible applicants but also has the broader objectives of arresting tendenciestoward dependency, chronic unemployment, and community deterioration inurban and rural areas. The emphases of projects must be on self-help andmobilization of the community-at-large and on providing opportunities foremployment and/or ownership within the targeted population. To this end,the program seeks (a) to attract additional private capital into distressedcommunities, including enterprise zones; (b) to build and expand the abilityof local institutions to better serve the economic needs of local residents;and (c) to provide new employment and ownership opportunities for low-incomepeople through business, physical or commercial development.Projects must further agency goals of public-private partnerships, andFederal initiatives such as urban and rural enterprise zones. OCS is particularlyinterested in receiving applications that stress public-private partnershipsthat are directed toward the development of economic self-sufficiency througha focus on economic expansion.Applicants located in a State-designated enterprise zone, i.e. an areain which a legislative entity has enacted a program of tax and regulatoryrelief to encourage business development, are encouraged to submit applications.Such applications must be linked with_and complement_enterprise zone initiatives,and may be for either a business development project or for a demonstrationof innovative ways of involving the poverty community in the implementationof the enterprise zone concept.Applications must show that the proposed project: (1) Will create a significantnumber of new permanent private sector jobs and/or will maintain existingjobs, all of which are targeted towards low-income residents who are eitherunemployed or underemployed. Emphasis should be on employment of individualswho are on public assistance including at-risk teenagers. While projectedemployment in future years may be included in the application, it is essentialthat the focus of employment projections concentrate on those jobs savedor created during the duration of the OCS grant period; and/or (2) willcreate a significant number of business development opportunities for low-incomeresidents of the community or significantly aid such residents in maintainingeconomically viable businesses.Any funds that are proposed to be used for training purposes must be limitedto providing specific job-related training to poverty level individualswho have been selected for employment in the grant supported project orwho have been selected for training or participation in a project wherepotential jobs have actually been identified.Projects which would result in the relocation of a business from one geographicarea to another are discouraged.Of the $18.909 million available for funding projects under this priorityarea, approximately $2.5 million will be set aside for projects which addressthe purposes of this priority area and which simultaneously target a numberof communities or impact areas thereby producing, due to management efficiencies,benefits on a larger scale than would single-funded projects undertakenin individual communities.OCS will not consider applications that propose to establish or expandrevolving loan funds nor proposals that are geared towards the establishmentof Small Business Investment Corporations of Minority Enterprise SmallBusiness Investment Corporations.OCS does not anticipate approving grants that subsequently will be subgrantedto an unrelated entity.See Part F, Section 4, for special instructions on developing a work programfor this priority area.Approximately 55 grants will be made under this priority area.Eligible applicants are private, locally initiated, non-profit communitydevelopment corporations (or affiliates of such corporations) governedby a board consisting of residents of the community and business and civicleaders.Priority Area 2.0 Assistance for Rural Housing and Community FacilitiesDevelopment <ITAG tagnum="81">2.1 Rural Housing Repairs and Rehabilitation</ITAG>The purpose of this priority area is to assist low-income residents inrural communities by providing grants to eligible applicants to: (a) providetechnical assistance to help low-income families and individuals to moreeffectively utilize existing local, State and Federal housing assistanceprograms; and (b) develop innovative ways to meet the housing needs oflow-income people, e.g. the rehabilitation or repair of existing substandardhousing units for occupancy by low-income residents, the conversion ofnon-residential buildings to low-income residential use, and the purchaseof homes by low-income people.OCS encourages applications that will assist low-income homeowners to improvetheir housing through self-help rehabilitation. These efforts should notbe duplicative of programs which can be funded through other existing Federalprograms.OCS is interested in proposals which will result in the following typesof tangible improvements and benefits related to housing conditions forrural poor people:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Interior or exterior structural repairs including weatherizationand alternative energy systems;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_job opportunities for local unskilled residents while assuring qualitywork;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_technical assistance and professional services related to housingand community planning by community-based design and planning organizations.(Projects should be conducted with maximum use of voluntary services ofprofessional and community personnel); and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_development of innovative housing strategies to help low-income ruralresidents acquire housing.</ITAG>Applications calling for new construction or `gut' rehabilitation willonly be considered if there is insufficient existing housing stock thatcan be economically rehabilitated.Funds will not be available for the repair or rehabilitation of low-incomerental housing unless the structure is either occupied by a low-incomeowner or the properties to be repaired are (a) owned by a private non-profitorganization and (b) covered by a written agreement which will ensure continuedoccupancy, after completion of repairs and rehabilitation, for at leastthree years by low-income people, as defined by DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines.(Additional information about these Guidelines is set out in Part C, paragraph7.)Funds will not be made available under this program priority area for establishingor expanding a revolving loan fund.See Part F, Section 4, for special instructions on developing a work programfor this priority area.Approximately 9 grants will be made under this Priority Area.Eligible applicants are States, public agencies or private non-profit organizations.OCS is particularly interested in receiving applications from such entitiesas rural housing development corporations, cooperatives, and other publicand private organizations with proven accomplishments in the area of ruralhousing.<ITAG tagnum="81">2.2: Rural Community Facilities Development (Water and Waste WaterTreatment Systems Development)</ITAG>Funds will be provided under this priority area to help low-income ruralcommunities develop the capability and expertise to establish and maintainor preserve affordable, adequate and safe water and waste water treatmentfacilities.Funds provided under this priority area may not be used for constructionof water and waste water treatment systems or for operating subsidies forsuch systems but matching funds may be used for these activities. Therefore,it is suggested that applicants coordinate projects with the Farmers HomeAdministration (FmHA) and other Federal and State agencies to ensure thatfunds for hardware for local community projects are available.See Part F, Section 4, for special instructions on developing a work programfor this priority area.Approximately 9 grants will be made under this priority area.Eligible applicants are Regional Technical Resource Centers and publicor private non-profit organizations with proven technical expertise andaccomplishments in water and waste water treatment programs.

Applicants whomobilize project support over and above the required matching share todirectly benefit the proposed project, will receive special considerationunder the rating criteria. OCS will not consider applications proposing to use to funds exclusivelyfor classroom instruction. Placement must be an integral activity. Applications submitted under this priority area must not contain requestsfor OCS funding for projects that would duplicate Community Services BlockGrant funding or activities for which funding is available from other Federalagencies such as the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture'sFood and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) programs, etc. See Part F, Section 4, for special instructions on developing a work programfor this priority area. Approximately 20 grants will be made under this priority area.

Grant Amounts </ITAG>Under Priority Area 1.0: No more than $500,000 or 25% of the total projectcosts, whichever is the lesser amount, will be provided for real estateprojects. (Any project that involves, in part or in whole, the purchase,construction or rehabilitation of property will be considered a real estateproject.) Applicants for funding other activities under this priority areaare strongly encouraged to refrain from submitting requests for more than$500,000. EXCEPTION: This ceiling does not apply to applications submittedunder the $2.5 million set aside. Under Priority Areas 2.0 and 3.0: Applicant requesting funds under thesepriority areas should assure that the total project costs are reasonablein light of the activities to be undertaken. 3. Grant Duration For most projects OCS will grant funds for one year. However, dependingon the characteristics of any individual project and the justificationpresented by the applicant in its proposal, a grant may be made for a longerperiod of time, i.e. up to two years. 4. Matching Funds An applicant is required to obtain commitment of at least the followingamounts of private or public funds to match each OCS dollar awarded: For projects submitted under Priority Area 1.0 (including the $2.5 millionset-aside), three public or private sector dollars are required for eachOCS dollar awarded for real estate projects and two public or private sectordollars for all other economic development projects. For projects submitted under Priority Area 2.1, two public or private sectordollars are required for each OCS dollar awarded. For projects submitted under Priority Area 2.2, one private sector or twopublic sector dollars are required for each OCS dollar awarded. For projects submitted under Priority Area 3.0, a match of at least oneprivate or public sector dollar to each dollar of OCS funds awarded isrequired. <T3>Exception:</T3> The match for projects submitted under Priority Areas1.0, 2.1 and 2.2 which will be carried out on Indian Reservations mustbe at least one private or public sector dollar for each dollar of OCSfunds awarded. Matching funds must be definitely committed or contingent only on receiptof the OCS grant. Speculative match, or match based on independent contingencies(such as receipt of another grant or lines of credit at the current marketrate set aside by banks for program participants), will not be countedtowards the matching requirement. Matching funds may be in the form of cash or in-kind fairly converted intotheir dollar equivalent. Some examples are loans for construction financing;mortgages; grants from States, counties, municipalities; contributionsfrom private individuals or organizations; equity investments that aremade to the project supported by the OCS grant; correlated training programs;related water or waste water installations; foundation support; and/orprivate and charitable contributions. OCS will accept as a match Federalmonies from State-administered block grants with compatible purposes whenthose programs do not prohibit their use as matching funds, e.g. the JobTraining Partnership Act, the Social Services Block Grant, and the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. Funds that are eligible to be counted as ``matching'' funds must be committedfor specific project activities within the OCS-approved project and usedonly for project purposes during the duration of the OCS grant. A grantee may not claim as matching funds wages earned as a result of trainingor skill improvements funded by the OCS grant. Funds expended or obligated prior to the approved OCS starting date fora grant cannot be considered as matching funds although currently-ownedassets which will be used in the OCS project may be applied against thematching requirement. While the matching requirement outlined in this section must be met foran application to be eligible for consideration, applicants generatingsupport either greater than that required and/or from private sector sources,may be eligible for additional points to be awarded by the reviewers. Exceptin unusual circumstances, documentation of any commitment of matching fundsmust be in the form of letters of commitment from the organizations/individualsfrom which funds will be received and the commitment must be valid at leastthrough the grant period. 5. Maintenance of Effort The activities funded under this Program Announcement must be in additionto, and not in substitution for, activities previously carried on withoutFederal assistance. Also, funds or other resources devoted to activitieswithin a community, area, or state will not be diminished in order to providethe required matching contributions. 6. Administrative Costs The OCS will accept applications that include administrative costs. However,since grant funds are extremely limited, no awards for only administrativecosts will be made and no more than 10 percent of the OCS discretionaryfunds awarded under a single grant may be used for administrative purposes.Administrative costs are defined as costs that are necessary to protect,monitor, properly account for, and apply to the approved project thoseFederal funds awarded. Costs associated with the internal operational managementof the approved project are not considered to be administrative costs norare costs for conducting the final audit. In all cases where an applicant has negotiated and claims a current indirectcost rate approved by the Department of Health and Human Services, theDefense Contracting Agency, or some other Federal agency, this rate ordinarilywill be recognized by OCS and applied to any OCS grant award. However,it is understood that both administrative and indirect costs are part of,and not in addition to, the amount of funds awarded in the subject grant.In most cases, the indirect cost rate approved will include not only administrativecosts but also other allowable costs that were negotiated under the applicant'sapproved indirect cost rate. Therefore, applicants with an applicable indirectcost rate exceeding 10 percent of the OCS grant may not propose any administrativefunds in excess of that rate. Thus, although the approved indirect costrate may exceed the normal 10 percent administrative cost restriction whichotherwise applies to all OCS discretionary grants, the entire approvedindirect cost rate will be accepted. 7. Program Beneficiaries Projects proposed for funding under this announcement must result in directbenefits targeted toward low-income people as defined in the most recentAnnual Revision of Poverty Income Guidelines published by DHHS. Attachment A to this announcement is an excerpt from the guidelines currentlyin effect (1987). Annual revisions of these guidelines are normally publishedin February or early March of each year and are applicable to projectsbeing implemented at the time of publication. It is anticipated that the1988 guidelines will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in February 1988. (These revised guidelines alsomay be obtained through the U.S. Government Printing Office at the followingaddress: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,Washington, DC 20402.) No other government agency or privately-defined poverty guidelines areapplicable for the determination of low-income eligibility for these OCSprograms. 8. Number of Projects in Application An application may contain only one project (although activities undertakenmay be in a number of communities or impact areas) and this project mustbe identified as responding to one of the program priority areas statedin this announcement. Applications which are not in compliance with thisrequirement will be ineligible for funding. 9. Multiple Submittals There is no limit to the number of applications that can be submitted undera specific program priority area as long as each application contains aproposal for a different project. 10. Sub-Contracting or Delegating Projects OCS does not anticipate funding any project where the rule of the eligibleapplicant is <T3>primarily </T3>to serve as a conduit for funds to organizations otherthan the applicant.   <ITAG tagnum="84">Part D_Application Procedures</ITAG>1.

The application must contain adetailed and specific work program that is both sound and feasible. Itmust set forth realistic quarterly time targets by which the various worktasks will be completed. (Because quarterly time schedules are used byOCS as a key instrument to monitor progress, failure to include these timetargets may seriously reduce an applicant's point score in this criterion.)It must identify critical issues or potential problems that might impactnegatively on the project and it must indicate how the project objectiveswill be attained notwithstanding any such potential problems.Projects funded under this announcement must produce permanent and measurableresults that will reduce the incidence of poverty in the areas targeted.The OCS grant funds, in combination with private and/or other public resources,must be targeted into low-income communities, distressed communities, and/ordesignated enterprise zones. Projects must be designed to achieve the specificprogram priority area objectives defined in this Program Announcement.If an applicant is proposing a project which will affect a property listedin or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Placesit must identify this property in the narrative and explain how it hascomplied with the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic PreservationAct of 1966 as amended. If there is any question as to whether the propertyis listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of HistoricPlaces, applicant should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer.(See Attachment E, item 12 for additional guidance.) The applicant shouldcontact OCS early in the development of its application to OCS for instructionsregarding compliance with the Act and data required to be submitted tothe Department of Health and Human Services. Failure to comply with thecited Act may result in the application being ineligible for considerationfor funding.The following are specific items to be addressed for each of the priorityareas:Priority Area 1.0: Urban and Rural Community Economic DevelopmentFollowing are examples of specific impact measures for this priority area:The number of new permanent direct jobs or ownership opportunities to becreated for low-income residents, especially those individuals being servedby public assistance programs of the area that the project is intendedto serve; the number of such jobs maintained; increase in taxes paid; newtechnical skills development and associated career opportunities for low-incomecommunity residents; development of the community's economic and physicalassets; the amount of non-Discretionary Program dollars to be mobilizedand the degree of involvement by private sector individuals, corporations,and foundations in the implementation of the project.Each application submitted under Priority Area 1.0 also must include acomplete Business Plan as part of its project work plan where such a BusinessPlan is appropriate to the project/venture. An application that does notinclude a Business Plan where one is appropriate may be found to be non-responsiveand the application may be disqualified and returned to the applicant.   The Business Plan is one of the major components that will be evaluatedby OCS to determine the feasibility of an economic development project.Therefore, the Business Plan must be well prepared and address all themajor issues noted herein.    The following guidelines show the necessary sections of a Business Plan,and what should be included in each section.    Use of these guidelines should result in a complete and professional BusinessPlan of not more than 20 pages which makes an orderly presentation of thefacts necessary to be judged responsive to the program announcement.   Because the guidelines were written to cover a variety of possibilities,rigid adherence to them is not possible nor even desirable for all projects.For example, a plan for a service business would not require a discussionof manufacturing nor product design.    <T3>Summary Business Plan: </T3>A 1-2 page summary of the Business Planshould be a brief and accurate presentation of the highlights of the projectand its opportunities and should include the following:    andbullet; <T3>The Project: </T3>Indicate when the company was founded, what is specialor unique about it and what it intends to accomplish in this project forwhich funds are being requested. Also indicate what in the background ofthe management team makes its members particularly qualified (e.g. uniqueknow-how) to pursue the business opportunity.    andbullet; <T3>Market Opportunity: </T3>Identify and briefly explain the market opportunity.This explanation should include information on the size and growth rateof the market for the business' product or service, and a statement indicatingthe percentage of that market that will be captured.
