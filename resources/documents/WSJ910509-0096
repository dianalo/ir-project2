Both sides of the issue agree that the administrationseems to have majority support for a two-year extension ofits authority to negotiate free-trade agreements on a&quot;fast-track' basis -- that is, under procedures that barcongressional amendments. With Congress due to act thismonth, the president has been meeting with undecidedlawmakers of both parties while members of his cabinet havebeen making the rounds on Capitol Hill.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;At this point, I would have to say we're behind,&quot; saidWilliam Cunningham of the AFL-CIO, which has made oppositionto the trade question its top legislative priority. Rep.Michael Andrews (D., Texas), who supports the administration,said, &quot;The momentum is on our side.&quot;   Mr. Bush has cast the issue as a referendum for freetrade, leaving many Democrats, and some Republicans, tornbetween a fear of appearing protectionist and concern aboutloss of local jobs to foreign competition.   Among those struggling hardest with the question is HouseMajority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who is expectedto announce his conditional support this week. He is workingon a resolution that would make fast-track authoritycontingent on Mr. Bush's ability to extract tougher labor andenvironmental standards from Mexico as part of any tradepact. Mr. Bush pledged to require such standards in an80-page document he sent to Congress last week.   Rep. Gephardt emphasized trade, and in particular the needfor tough steps against unfair competitors, in hisunsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign, so his views holdweight with some fellow Democrats. But he was labeled aprotectionist by critics, a charge that continues to sting ashe weighs the fast-track issue.   &quot;If Dick Gephardt is a candidate for president, he'll befor it,&quot; said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman DanRostenkowski (D., Ill.), an administration supporter. TheWays and Means Committee is due to take up the trade issuenext week, the first step in the approval process. Withoutcongressional action this month, the president's authority isextended automatically.   A negative vote in either house would defeat the request.The Senate has been considered friendlier territory than theHouse, although yesterday two liberal Democrats, Sens. HowardMetzenbaum of Ohio and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, saidthey weren't satisfied with President Bush's promises onenvironmental or labor-protection issues.   The fast-track authority is critical both to Mr. Bush'splans for a Mexico pact and to the continuing talks for theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalizing worldtrade. The Mexico agreement has proven the morecontroversial, as many lawmakers fear U.S. industries will gosouth for cheap labor and lax environmental laws.   Because segments of organized labor oppose both the Mexicoand GATT talks, lobbyists are united in seeking a votederailing both. But faced with the likelihood of defeat, theAFL-CIO and others who most oppose a Mexico pact have begunpressing House Democratic leaders for a separate floor voteon that issue.   Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), who is a free-tradeadvocate, has made no commitments, and aides say a split voteis unlikely -- in part because Hispanic lawmakers would beoffended. Democratic leaders, including Rep. Gephardt, aretrying to assure labor that they will hold Mr. Bush to hispromises. The opponents aren't persuaded.   &quot;Here we are, asking for their help on just getting a voteon an issue, and their response is, `Trust us, we'll monitorthe situation,'&quot; the AFL-CIO's Mr. Cunningham said.</TEXT></DOC>
