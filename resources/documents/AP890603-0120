(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 4,000 anti-nuclear activistsSaturday staged the biggest rally against the Seabrook nuclearplant in 11 years, a prelude to a civil disobedience protestplanned for Sunday.   Traffic lined a highway that runs by the seaside plant, and manyof the cars sported anti-Seabrook signs. At Hampton Beach StatePark, less than two miles from the plant, protesters heard speakersdenounce Seabrook and promise to continue fighting to prevent itfrom operating commercially.   Seabrook opponent Steve Comley drew cheers when he told thegathering he had hired planes pulling anti-nuclear banners to flyover the beach Saturday and about 40 miles up the Maine coast toPresident Bush's home at Kennebunkport, Maine, on Sunday. Bush wasspending the weekend there.   ``The nuclear industry and some of the people in Washingtonbelieve this fight is over,'' Comley said. ``I'll tell you, we'rejust starting.''   The anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance is organizing the protests,which it hopes will be the biggest since May 1977, when 1,414people were arrested at the Seabrook site. About 2,500 arrests havebeen made in protests at the plant since construction began in 1976.   Saturday's rally had the largest turnout since a 1978 protestthat drew an estimated 18,000 people.   Officials in neighboring Massachusetts also have sought to blockthe plant by refusing to cooperate with emergency evacuationplanning. Despite the opposition, Seabrook won its low-powertesting license from federal regulators on May 26, nearly threeyears after the $6 billion reactor was completed.   Plant officials have begun preparing for the first atomic chainreaction by Tuesday or Wednesday, plant spokesman Ron Sher said.   Sher, who stopped by the rally, said the protesters representeda ``vocal minority.''   ``But the majority of people in New Hampshire, Massachusetts andthe rest of New England recognize that nuclear power is a viableenergy alternative and Seabrook ... is ready to produce electricityand it can make an important contribution,'' Sher said.   The plant first must win federal approval for evacuation plansfor crowded summer beaches and communities up to 10 miles away.   ``The truth is you cannot evacuate Hampton Beach and the otherbeaches and protect the people,'' attorney Robert Backus, who hasrepresented anti-Seabrook groups since 1972, told the crowd.   ``The truth is we don't know what to do with nuclear waste,''Backus said. ``The truth is that the plant is uneconomic.''   Before the weekend, at least 300 to 500 people went throughtraining sessions on non-violent civil disobedience, Clamshellspokesman Paul Gunter said. The sessions continued Saturday.   On Sunday, some activists planned to climb fences surroundingthe 715-acre plant site and others planned to sit down outsidegates. Some protesters also planned to go to a railroad siding atthe plant to re-create an August 1976 protest in which 18 peoplewere arrested _ the first group civil disobedience against a U.S.nuclear power plant.   Earlier in the week, Superior Court Judge Vincent Dunn let thetown charge the organizers a $300 fee and $3,600 bond for anassembly permit. Clamshell members said they couldn't and wouldn'tpay.   Since a town ordinance bars gatherings of more than 25 peoplewithout a permit, the activists said they planned to march to theplant on Sunday in groups of fewer than 20.</TEXT></DOC>
