Gold prices slipped in New York after rising overseas. RepublicNational Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $381.55 for a troyounce of gold, down slightly from Wednesday's late bid of $381.80.   The dollar advanced in early trading in response to rising oilprices, said Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal andamp; Co. Inc.   The Fed entered the market several times, selling small amountsof dollars, but the U.S. currency continued its climb.   However, in mid-afternoon, with the dollar at a peak for the dayof about 134.50 Japanese yen, the Fed made what Barbanel called ``amassive intervention,'' selling dollars for West German marks andJapanese yen.   ``The Fed, when they really mean what they say, intervenes instages that over time become more sizable,'' said Barbanel.   West German and Japanese officials ``don't want to see thedollar gaining any more strength'' and the Fed acted in response tothose countries' wishes, Barbanel said.   Traders took the hint, and sold the dollar down against othercurrencies as well.   The dollar ended the day in New York falling to 1.8910 WestGerman marks from late Wednesday's 1.8934 marks. It slipped to132.00 Japanese yen from Wednesday's 133.115 yen.   What the dollar does next depends on whether the interventioncontinues Friday, Barbanel said.   However, another factor that could affect the currency marketsis a possible hike in the Japanese discount rate, which was rumoredto be in the offing, Barbanel said.   A hike in the key Japanese interest rate would likely befollowed by increases in West German and British rates. That wouldboost those currencies and cause the dollar to decline.   Overseas dealers described Thursday's trading as nervousfollowing intervention by central banks over several days.   ``There's very little going on. People don't know what they wantto do,'' said one dealer at a West German bank.   In London, one British pound cost $1.6875 late Thursday, moreexpensive for buyers than Wednesday's $1.6870.
