WhiteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DSLTTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   After 101 years in the salt mines, Diamond Crystal Salt Co. is getting out of the trade that made it a household word.    In the shakeout among salt sellers, the St. Clair, Mich.-based purveyor of the &quot;uncommon salt&quot; with the red diamond on the container decided it just wasn't big enough to survive.    &quot;We were a small salt company up against the big boys,&quot; said Frank N. Hayes, vice president, finance.    With salt division losses mounting, and competitors closing in, the company agreed yesterday to sell its core business for $65 million to one of the biggest of the big boys, International Salt Co., a unit of the Dutch chemical conglomerate Akzo N.V.    If approved by the Federal Trade Commission and Diamond Crystal's board and shareholders, the company, in effect, will be starting all over again, joining a growing number of corporations that are shedding their old businesses, images -- and even their names.    For Diamond Crystal, abandoning the salt trade means excising nearly 80% of the company. Salt, including the table salt (best known in the East), rock salt and salts for water softeners, accounted for about $98.5 million of the company's $121.3 million in sales during the fiscal year ended March 31.    About 1,050 of Diamond Crystal's 1,300 employees worked in the salt division in Michigan, Ohio, North Dakota and Utah.    Only seven months ago, Diamond Crystal spent $800,000 to buy a solar salt business on the shores of the Great Salt Lake; that plant is part of the sale.    Diamond Crystal will be left with its Diamond Crystal Specialty Foods Inc. unit, which produces salt-and-pepper packets, low-sodium dietary products and &quot;meal service kits&quot; -- packages that include seasonings, condiments and cutlery. The unit generated $23 million in sales during the 1987 fiscal year.    Although it has been public since 1961, the firm is still in large measure a family operation. Founder Charles Moore's greatgrandson, company Chairman Frederick S. Moore, and members of his family control more than 50% of the stock.    Agreeing to sell the heart of the company &quot;was a difficult decision,&quot; said Mr. Hayes. &quot;But when you look at the sheer economics of the market, and when you're up against billion-dollar competitors,&quot; staying in the salt business &quot;didn't make economic sense.&quot;    Not surprisingly, a major question facing the company is what to do next.    &quot;We're going through somewhat of a transition in management and a change in strategic thinking,&quot; said Mr. Hayes. Among items on the agenda, he said, will be finding the company a new name.    What will it be?    &quot;We don't know yet,&quot; said Mr. Hayes. </TEXT></DOC>
