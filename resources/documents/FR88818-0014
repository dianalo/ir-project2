This is not a toll-free number.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This regulation sets forth the policywithin the Department of Justice for the handling of allegations againstMembers of Congress. It is designed to promote confidence in the integrityof investigations and prosecutions for violations of federal criminal lawand is based in part on the regulations used by the Department in connectionwith the Watergate Special Prosecutors. By announcing a policy that specialindependent counsels will investigate any criminal law allegation againsta Member of Congress, the Department will be able to remove any real orapparent concern that a particular investigation may be politically motivated.Since the decision whether to prosecute will be made by an individual whohas no long-term affiliation with the Department or any branch of government,it will demonstrate to the public that neither political hostility norpolitical favoritism played a part in the final decision. This rule willtherefore provide for nondiscretionary referral to a special independentcounsel whenever the Attorney General determines that there is specificand credible evidence that any Member of Congress has violated a federalcriminal law other than certain specified misdemeanors.This is not a major rule within the meaning of Exec. Order No. 12291. Thiswill not have an impact on a significant number of small businesses. 5U.S.C. 901.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 0</ITAG>Authority delegations (Government agencies).By the authority vested in me including 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, 515, 516, 517,519 and 5 U.S.C. 301 and 3101, Subpart B of Part 0 of title 28 of the Codeof Federal Regulations, is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 0_ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</ITAG>1.
