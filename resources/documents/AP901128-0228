(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crabs for Christmas?   Sounds strange, but tiny hermit tree crabs that local teen-agersare buying as pets and wearing on chains around their necks may beone of the hot new gifts under, or perhaps climbing up, the treethis year.   ``When they're on the person, it usually takes five or sixminutes before he'll feel comfortable enough to come out of hisshell and crawl around on the person's clothes,'' said JamesAllemon, owner of Indian Harbor, a Rockford gift shop that beganselling the 1-inch Caribbean crabs in September.   He first sold the crabs, supplied by a Tennessee company, aspets in miniature terrariums. But when Allemon and his wife noticedloops on some of the crabs' gold-tone trimmed seashells, theydecided the crustaceans would make the perfect pendant.   He's sold about 50 of the $6.95 crab necklaces - mostly toteen-agers - in the last two months and about 500 in cages.   Rockford High School sophomore Monica Leeuwenburg has only wornher crab, named Future, to school a couple of times. She knows afew other students who wear the crabs as necklaces and several mores forprotection. They canlive to be 70 years old.   Leeuwenburg said Future spends most of his time in a stone-linedfish bowl, where he eats vegetables and his favorite snack, peanutbutter.   ``And he always comes out of his shell when there's music on,''she said with a giggle. ``I don't know if he's dancing or what.''   But animal rights advocates aren't amused.   ``We are against any unnecessary activity which may impede ananimal's natural life,'' Ken Johnson, an investigator for theHumane Society of the United States, said from Washington. ``Ithink that this would restrict the crabs from living naturally, dueto the fact that they wouldn't have access to food and water whenthey need it.''   But Allemon said his crab necklaces are sold with a book abouttheir care.   ``We're not doing this for the shock value,'' Allemon said.``The crab comes with responsibilities, like any pet.''   Gardner Enterprises of Hendersonville, Tenn., which sells thecrabs to pet and gift shops, only recently heard that the crabswere being sold as jewelry in a few cities.   Gardner manager Yolanda Alexander said crabs' popularity as petsis growing, noting the comaany has sold about 50,000 crabs of allsizes in the past two months.   ``But I'm surprised people want to wear them around theirnecks,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
