This is accomplished by injecting a small amount of a surfactantalong with the steam. Sometimes also, a noncondensible gas such as nitrogenis mixed in. Foam's high apparent viscosity could greatly improve themobility ratio, and the blocking ability of foam is useful in reducingthe thieving effect of high permeability streaks on premature steam breakthrough.As reported by Lescure and Claridge, these beneficial characteristicscould also be utilized to improve the efficiency of other enhanced recoverymethods, namely carbon dioxide flooding.</TEXT></DOC>
