That's what it was for some corporate insiders, accordingto filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Theseofficers and directors sold stock in their companies justweeks before prices fell sharply.</LP><TEXT>   According to the SEC filings:   -- David F. Brown, former chairman of General DevelopmentCorp., sold his entire stake in the Miami real estate companyin the two weeks before it filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy-law protection April 6. Mr. Brown, who resignedunder pressure from the company's board March 14, sold 39,059shares at an average price of $4.40 a share. The stockfinished yesterday at $1.375 a share, up 12.5 cents, in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.   -- Seven insiders at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. sold80,765 shares of the mutual fund between March 6 and March13. Since then, the price of the Baltimore company's stockhas fallen about 16%, chiefly on the company's March 30announcement that some of its mutual funds held commercialpaper issued by Mortgage andamp; Realty Trust, a real-estateinvestment trust that filed for bankruptcy protection. Innational over-the-counter trading yesterday, T. Rowe Priceshares closed at $24.25, down 25 cents; the insiders sold atan average share price of $28.71.   -- Eight insiders at Network Equipment Technologies Inc.sold over 164,539 shares in late January and February. Theygot $28 to $31 a share; the stock's price has since fallensharply, closing yesterday at $10.625 a share, up 87.5 cents,in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   Mr. Brown sold all of his General Development Corp. sharesfrom March 23 through March 30, shortly after he pleadedguilty March 22 in federal court in Miami to one count ofconspiracy. On the same day, the company also pleaded guiltyin a plea bargain with federal prosecutors to settle chargesit defrauded home buyers by charging inflated prices based onimproper appraisals.   General Development agreed to pay a $500,000 fine, andunder a pending restitution agreement, would pay the homebuyers about $80 million to $100 million over 25 years.   Mr. Brown and his attorney declined to comment on thesales. Otis Wragg, spokesman for General Development,declined to comment other than to say that Mr. Brown didn'thave to sell his stock as part of an agreement tied to hisdeparture from the company.   Although Mr. Brown's shares, at an average price of $4.40a share, sold for far more than he would have earned if hehad waited to sell them until after the bankruptcy filing,the former chairman probably lost money on the transaction.Some of the shares were acquired through a retirement plan,or through the exercise of warrants provided by the company,but SEC files show Mr. Brown bought slightly less than halfof the shares in the open market in purchases from 1986through 1988, paying $13.38 to $22.65 a share.   The stock of T. Rowe Price has also skidded lower sinceits insider sales, chiefly on the company's exposure to theproblems of Mortgage andamp; Realty Trust. On April 16, T. Rowedisclosed it holds about $65 million of the REIT's commercialpaper and notes, and later announced it would take a $4million charge against second-quarter earnings as a result.   Stephen Norwitz, spokesman for the company, said thestrong pace of insider selling in March was &quot;coincidental,&quot;adding that Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. didn't downgrade Mortgageandamp; Realty's commercial paper until March 13 -- after most ofthe insiders had sold -- and that the REIT didn't file forbankruptcy protection until later in the month.   The largest sale was by William D. Gould Jr., a vicepresident, who sold 30,000 shares March 6 and March 8. Thesale represented 36% of his holding in the company, SECfilings show. Stephen Boesel, portfolio manager of the firm'sGrowth andamp; Income Mutual Fund, sold 21,000 shares, the firsttime he has sold shares since September 1986. SEC filingsshow Mr. Boesel retains 21,100 shares, but the company saidhe holds an additional 100,000 shares that have been omittedin filings to the SEC.   The other T. Rowe insiders sold between 1,260 and 15,000shares, representing 5% to 57% of their holdings, accordingto the company.   Mr. Boesel and Mr. Gould declined to comment. Mr. Norwitzsaid Mr. Boesel sold his shares to purchase a house, whileMr. Gould sold to meet a personal obligation.   At Network Equipment Technologies Inc., Chairman BruceSmith was one of the biggest sellers, trimming his holdings50,000 shares Jan. 24 through Feb. 15, according to SECfilings. They show that he retains 179,781 shares. SteveSchlumberger, formerly a company vice president and now onsabbatical, also sold 50,000 shares in February, retaining75,358 shares, SEC filings show.   The other six NET insiders sold between 393 and 23,000shares, representing less than 1% to 50% of their holdings inthe company, according to SEC filngs.   The company declined to comment on the sales or to confirmthe SEC figures.   On April 2, the company announced that its fiscalfourth-quarter results would fall well below expectations. Itreported those results April 25. For the quarter ended March31, it had earnings of four cents a share, down 87% from ayear earlier, on an 18% revenue rise.</TEXT></DOC>
