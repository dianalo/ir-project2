Morris Jr., the computer &quot;hacker&quot; who unleasheda virus that disrupted a nationwide electronic mail networkin 1988, was sentenced by a federal judge in Syracuse, N.Y.,to three years probation and a $10,000 fine.   Judge Howard Munson also ordered Mr. Morris, 25 years old,to perform 400 hours of community service.</LP><TEXT>   Computer experts said the sentence was too light to serveas much of a deterrent to similar crimes by hackers.   In January, Mr. Morris was convicted of violating thefederal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, under which he couldhave been imprisoned for as long as five years and fined asmuch as $250,000. The case has been closely watched in thecomputer industry because of rising concern about breaches ofcomputer security.   &quot;I don't think people in this country are quite ready tosend someone to the slammer&quot; for launching a computer virus,said Belden Menkus, a computer-security consultant inHillsboro, Tenn. &quot;If there had been a theft of funds, a jailterm would have been more likely.&quot; Added Clifford Stoll, aHarvard University astronomer known as an authority oncomputer breakins: &quot;I'm not surprised {by the sentence}because of the nature of what {Mr. Morris} did and the lackof malice involved.&quot;   During Mr. Morris's trial, his attorney argued that he wasguilty of a mistake rather than a crime. Mr. Morris's virus,or &quot;worm&quot; program, was designed to spread quietly throughInternet, an electronic mail system used by academic,corporate and government researchers. But because of aprogramming error, Mr. Morris said in his testimony, itcareened out of control. The program sped through thousandsof computers nationwide and disrupted operations at manycomputer centers linked by the network.   Federal prosecutors argued that Mr. Morris was guilty ofmore than an innocent prank, noting that he stole computerpasswords and designed his program to be difficult toeradicate from computers.   Among computer professionals, &quot;the consensus was that {Mr.Morris} should have gotten at least a modest amount of jailtime as a deterrent,&quot; said Jack Bologna, editor of Computersand Security magazine in Plymouth, Mich. &quot;Even 90 days wouldhave been better than nothing at all.&quot;   Mr. Morris plans to appeal his conviction in an attempt toerase the felony from his record, said Thomas Guidoboni, hisattorney, at a news conference. He added that Mr. Morrisalready has had offers from computer-service providerswilling to put him to work to discharge his community-servicerequirement. One offer came from a state agency in WestVirginia that wants Mr. Morris to work on computer programsthat help in collecting child-support payments, Mr. Guidoboniadded.</TEXT></DOC>
