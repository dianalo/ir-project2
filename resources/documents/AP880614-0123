Mubarak Awad, an advocate of non-violent Palestinian resistance,was deported Monday by the Israeli government, which accused him ofsubversion.   Awad, a U.S. citizen who was born in Jerusalem and returnedthere in 1983, said he might convert from Christianity to Judaismand seek re-entry under Israel's Law of the Return ``if everything(else) failed.''   ``It's going to take a lot of guts to do it,'' Awad said at anews conference. ``Maybe I have to do it.''   ``I am here, but not by choice,'' he said. ``I was deported justbecause I am a Christian. If I were a Jew, I would not bedeported.''   Under the Law of the Return, any Jew can enter Israel. But theprivilege is not absolute; gangster Meyer Lansky, for example,sought Israeli citizenship under the law in 1970, but was forced toleave in 1972 following allegations of his continued involvement inorganized crime.   Pressed on the subject of conversion, Awad said, ``I'll tell (arabbi) frankly ... it's not my belief. It's a political statementthat I'm persecuted because I'm a Christian.''   Leaders of reform Judaism, meanwhile, issued a letter sayingthat ``extraneous motivations, political motivations, are notsufficient reason'' for conversion.   ``No one can rule out the possibility of a sincere conversion inanybody's case, but this must be proved at the end of a long periodof instruction,'' said a letter sent to 1,500 Reform rabbis in theUnited States and Canada.   But Awad said he would first pursue other avenues to return toIsrael, including appealing to international public opinion. Hesaid he planned meetings with officials at the United Nations, inWashington, Europe and the Soviet Union.   In ordering Awad deported, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamiralleged that he played a key role in this year's Arab uprising inthe occupied territories.   But Awad disclaimed any overriding influence among Palestinians,saying ``Shamir, he's the one who made me a hero.''   He defended his support of the Palestine LiberationOrganization, but said he did not support all the organization'sactions or policies. ``I condemn violence from the PLO, fromIsraelis, from everybody,'' he said.   Awad denied inciting violence against Israel but has supportedthe uprising in the territories Israel captured in the 1967 MiddleEast war. Some tactics he has long advocated, such as tax boycottsand commercial strikes, were adopted by leaders of the uprising.   Awad is the 21st Arab to be expelled by Israel since the Dec. 8start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip. His expulsion was protested by the Reaganadministration.   Awad was deported on the grounds that his three-month touristvisa issued last August had expired. The Israelis refused to extendthe visa, and the Israeli Supreme Court last week rejected Awad'sappeal to stay.   Awad, who lived in the United States for 13 years beforereturning to Jerusalem in 1983, is the founder of the PalestinianCenter for the Study of Non-Violence in that city. He has lecturedon civil disobedience, counseled teachers against corporalpunishment and planted olive trees in West Bank villages tounderscore the Arabs' claim to the land.   He lived in Wapakoneta, Ohio, where he still owns a home. Hiswife, Nancy Nye, said she soon will be going to Jerusalem to teach.</TEXT></DOC>
