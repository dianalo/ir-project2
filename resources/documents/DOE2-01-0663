Genetic improvementof cottonwoods (Populus spp.) has produced clones with average yieldsof 25 dry Mg/ha/y. Physiological research on cottonwoods and their hybridshave shown that the hybrids were intermediate to their parental typesin many characteristics. The goal of this research is to identify individualtraits contributing to enhanced growth and to genetically improve thesetraits. The biotechnological goal is to develop herbicide and pest-resistanthybrid poplars. Models have been developed to describe both individualand stand growth in an effort to determine productivity and identifytree ideotypes that grow well in short-rotation intensive culture systems.</TEXT></DOC>
