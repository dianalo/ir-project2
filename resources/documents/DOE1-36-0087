<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0087 </DOCNO><TEXT>The analytical approach of Temme (1983 and 1985), based on uniform asymptoticexpansions, is extended to an additional class of incomplete Laplaceintegrals. The terminology is introduced; the construction of the formalseries is explained; representations for the remainders are derived;the asymptotic nature of the expansions is explored; and error boundsare determined. Numerical results are presented for the case of the incompletebeta function. 14 references.</TEXT></DOC>
