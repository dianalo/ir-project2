The pact is important because it allows Pan Am, whichearlier this month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-courtprotection, to keep flying the 21 planes, considered vital tothe carrier's operations. Pan Am would probably have beenforced to cancel many flights if it hadn't reached thisagreement.</LP><TEXT>   The arrangement also puts Pan Am executives in a strongerposition when they speak about their reorganization plans ata scheduled meeting of the company's unsecured creditorstomorrow in New York. Pan Am filed the pact Friday withBankruptcy Judge Cornelius Blackshear, and the judge signedoff on the pact.   In December, A.I. Leasing II, an affiliate of Airbus,terminated the leases on 21 Airbus A300 and A310 aircraftbecause the company's Pan American World Airways unit hadn'tpaid $16 million due. Airbus issued Pan Am a deadline ofyesterday to relinquish the use of the aircraft.   The planes' leases expire just when an $150 millioninterim loan by Bankers Trust comes due at Pan Am. Sourcesfamiliar with the agreement said that Pan Am asked for theMarch 8 deadline from Airbus and was able to wringinexpensive short-term lease rates from the European aircraftconsortium. The market for used aircraft has softenedconsiderably in recent months.</TEXT></DOC>
