(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildlife officials who found three``cold, frightened'' abandoned black bear cubs in a telephone boothsaid Wednesday they're questioning a suspect who claims he fatallyshot the bears' mother in self-defense.   The mother's head and claws were found in a Bay City-arearesidence Tuesday night after Department of Natural Resourcesofficials received a tip on its toll-free poaching hotline, saidLt. Jay Larson of the department's Mio office.   ``He's claiming it was self-defense,'' Larson said of thesuspect, whom he would not identify. ``He's claiming he was outrabbit hunting and the bear attacked him.''   The suspect on Wednesday led wildlife officials to the bear'scarcass in a swamp in the Au Sable State Forest in Crawford County,in the northern Lower Peninsula.   Mark Lutz, a state conservation officer, rescued the cubs lastweek after an anonymous caller said he had found them in a trashcontainer in rural Crawford County. The man said he would leavethem in a telephone booth from where he was calling, 18 miles eastof Grayling.   The caller was gone when Lutz arrived. But the cubs, two malesand one female about 2 months old, were in a milk crate wrapped incanvas.   ``They were cuddled up, cold, frightened and wet,'' Lutz said.   The cubs have been turned over to the Wildlife RecoveryAssociation in Midland, which will attempt to find a permanent homefor the bears, probably in zoos. The past week of handling byhumans probably has left them unable to return to the wild, saidcaretaker Barb Rogers.   Larson said it was unclear who placed the original anonymouscall to the department, but guesses it may have been one of threepeople who were in the rabbit hunting party.   The suspect is not being held and no charges have been filed,but there may be charges filed later, Larson said.   Before the animals were turned over to the Wildlife RecoveryAssociation, Lutz and his wife, June, cared for them at theirGrayling home.   The cubs joined the Lutzes' 9-week-old daughter in beingbottle-fed, Mrs. Lutz said. The couple carefully let their3{-year-old daughter and visitors to the house watch and pet the7-pound animals.   ``They had a cute little growl,'' Mrs. Lutz said, but added:``They had pretty good claws on them already. They were teething,like a puppy.''   Within two years, the bears will weigh 200 to 300 pounds.</TEXT></DOC>
