(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first man since the Vietnam War to getthrough eight years of draft eligibility without being called toarms said something was missing from his 26th birthday celebration.   ``I'm proud within myself about it. I wish I had an award orsomething though. That would have been nice. Maybe a plaque to hangon the wall,'' said Joseph Frank.   Frank, the first 18-year-old to sign up and be processed by theSelective Service System after draft registration was revived in1981, turned 26 on Friday. That made him too old to be called upeven if Congress and the president reactivate the draft, accordingto Selective Service officials in Washington.   ``I didn't have to go active and I'm glad about that,'' Franksaid. ``But if it was God's will I would have gone. It's a blessingto be a soldier for this country.''   Frank said he had no idea he was the first man in the country toregister when he did so. He said he just followed the law and signedup.   ``I wasn't worried about being drafted when I was 18. I don'tthink I even thought about it, but if it had happened it would havejust happened. When I turned 21 I got more worried about it,'' Franksaid.   The draft was stopped in 1973 after the end of the Vietnam War,but registration was revived on Jan. 5, 1981. Federal law requiresevery man to register with Selective Service within 30 days of his18th birthday.</TEXT></DOC>
