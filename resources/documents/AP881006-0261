On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate plunged 47 cents to settle at $12.60 abarrel Wednesday in heavy, hectic trading. Still, the benchmarkU.S. crude recovered from its intra-day low of $12.28 barrel.   In early trading today, it was up another 22 cents at $12.82 abarrel.   Crude futures prices have not been this low since August 1986. Amonth ago, the near-term WTI contract had settled at $14.79.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the Novembercontract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 1.67 cents to settleat 39.44 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.41 centto 37.76 cents a gallon.   Much of the day's selling was technical in nature, analysts said.   Oil prices fell sharply on early rumors that Nigeria had decidedto leave the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries and that OPEC General Secretary Subroto, known as acrafter of compromises, would step down.   Prices recovered somewhat when the rumors were denied.   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investment atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., said ``this market has become sorumor-sensitive that even if a story doesn't sound credible, thereis a violent reaction.''   Barakat said at least some of the rumors were being instigatedby floor traders seeking to benefit their own positions. He alsosaid Saudi Arabia was giving the market a dose of its own``intensive shock therapy.''   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, has voiced threatsthat it will continue overproducing unless other OPEC members abideby their production quotas.   ``We're in a price war,'' said Peter Beutel, an assistantdirector at Elders Futures Inc. Unless the Saudis change theirpolicy, the only way oil prices will rise is through technicalfactors.   ``There's no hope on the fundamental front,'' he said.   Even before trading began, the market was poised for a selloffwith the latest statistics from the American Petroleum Institute.The report, which was released after the close of trading Tuesday,showed a higher-than-expected increase in crude oil stocks.   The report also showed a sharp increase in refinery runs. ``Itjust scares people to see the refineries looking like they aregoing to increase the supply of refined products,'' Beutel said.</TEXT></DOC>
