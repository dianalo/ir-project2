Three weeks ago, the front won a sweeping victory in thefirst free national elections in Algeria's history. But lastweekend the military, fearing an Islamic takeover, peacefullyousted Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid and canceled thesecond round of elections scheduled for today.</LP><TEXT>   Tension has been building ever since. Tanks and soldierssporting rifles and bayonets have been guarding keygovernment and communication buildings here since Saturdaynight. While little groups of unemployed men linger as usualon the city's sidewalks, drinking coffee, playing cards andreading newspapers, their chatter has turned much less idle.   &quot;Am I afraid? Not at all,&quot; says one 40-year-old man infront of a tobacco shop. &quot;Why should I be afraid of a civilwar if I have the holy Koran on my side?&quot;   Islamic Front leaders have urged their followers --including soldiers -- to stay vigilant, &quot;ready for anyeventuality.&quot; But they haven't called for an openinsurrection. The ruling junta, &quot;professional despots,&quot; inthe words of Islamic leaders, is trying to provoke violentopposition so it can launch a bloody crackdown,fundamentalists claim. So far, the leaders' caution hasprevailed, but the big test will come tomorrow, on Muslims'traditional day of prayer.   Many Islamic Front supporters are biding their time inanger. &quot;We had a vote. They canceled it. You call thisdemocracy?&quot; asks a young taxi driver, slowing to a near stopto make his point.   Until yesterday's arrests, which the government didn'tconfirm, the military-dominated government that succeeded Mr.Bendjedid had covered itself with a veneer ofconstitutionality. On Tuesday, it named a High State Councilto assume presidential duties until the end of Mr.Bendjedid's term next year. The council is to be headed byMohammed Boudiaf, a 72-year-old hero of Algeria's eight-yearrevolt against France, who has been living in exile inMorocco since 1964.   The military leaders clearly hope that Mr. Boudiaf canunify the nation. The military's own party, the NationalLiberation Front, has ruled the country singlehandedly sinceAlgeria's independence in 1962. But as Algeria's oil-basedeconomy has slumped in the past decade, and as poverty andunemployment have mushroomed, the NLF has been reviled forcorruption. Mr. Boudiaf, untainted in exile, gives the partya fresh face.   &quot;The new head of the high council is an excellent choice,&quot;says Mohammed Toumi, an NLF candidate in last month'slegislative election. &quot;He is a true patriot who will save therepublic.&quot;   To Dr. Toumi, a cardiologist, and to much of thiscountry's French-speaking elite, saving the republic meansdestroying the Islamic Salvation Front. At an informalmeeting of government officials and doctors in Dr. Toumi'soffice yesterday, Europeanized professionals spoke stronglyof the need to purge Algeria of Islamic radicals. He and hiscolleagues fought for liberation from France, one doctorsaid, erupting with anger. &quot;We are not about to lose ourfreedom now to some Ayatollah Khomeini,&quot; he said, invokingthe late Iranian leader who established an Islamicfundamentalist regime in Tehran.   &quot;Here's a party that wants to destroy democracy by usingdemocracy,&quot; Dr. Toumi continued. &quot;It sounds paradoxical, butto save the constitution, it's necessary to useunconstitutional means. The Islamic Front must beeradicated.&quot;   If the government does move to undo the fundamentalists --and yesterday's arrests may have signaled it already has --the military is likely to act on three fronts, Algerians say.The fundamentalists' political party will be outlawed, moreof its leaders will be jailed, and its paramilitarysympathizers will be hunted down by the army. (Hundreds ofAlgerian fundamentalists are believed to have been trained byAfghanistan's mujahadeen. In December they killed severalsoldiers in an attack near the Tunisian border.)   Some professionals and politicians have condemned Mr.Bendjedid's forced resignation, calling it a military coup.One highly respected opposition figure criticized themilitary's confrontational policies as playing into the handsof Muslim radicals.   But in the comfortable quarters of upper-class Algiers,relief is palpable, even among some Algerians who say theyhad dearly hoped democracy would work.   Now, many say, with the governing council in place and themilitary clearly committed to eliminating what it sees as thefundamentalist threat, it is only a matter of time until somepretext is found to forcefully suppress the Islamic Front.   &quot;The timing all depends on how the Islamic Front reacts,&quot;said a mid-level bureaucrat in Algeria's Foreign Ministry.&quot;If they incite the people at the mosques {tomorrow}, themilitary won't wait. But if it stays calm, it may be days orweeks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
