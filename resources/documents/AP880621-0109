Government radio said in a nighttime broadcast that therestrictions began immediately and would last until August 19. Thecurfew runs from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.   Witnesses said thousands of students and other protesters foughtstone-throwing duels with police after authorities closed a Rangoonuniversity where students had staged peaceful anti-governmentrallies.   ``Five police personnel were killed, and 26 others seriouslywounded as a result of an attack by unruly mob armed with swords,sticks and catapults,'' the broadcast said. ``A member of the mobalso was killed and several others wounded.''   ``Since these violent acts disrupt public tranquility and causepublic disorder, the Rangoon Division Peoples Council deemed itnecessary to impose a curfew and ban public meetings anddemonstrations within the Rangoon municipal area,'' it said.   The broadcast said the mob set fire to one police station andthe family quarters of another station. They damagedgovernment-owned buildings and traffic light posts, it said.   The government Monday announced that classes at Rangoon Arts andScience University, its affiliate colleges and the Institute ofEconomics were to be suspended after an upsurge of student protestsagainst the 25-year-old rule of Burmese military dictato~n.   Another government radio broadcast today announced thesuspension of classes, effective Wednesday, of two moreinstitutions where students have staged peaceful anti-governmentrallies _ the Institute of Medicine and the Institute of DentalScience.   Witnesses said today's fighting began when about 1,000 studentsof the arts and science university marched from campus towarddowntown Rangoon. High school students joined them.   About 200 riot police swung batons and hurled stones to stop themarchers about two miles south of the campus, witnesses said.   They said the demonstrators, who had grown to 5,000 strong,hurled stones and other objects and forced police to retreat ablock south to a military barricade.   The protesters then dispersed in small groups.   In the nearby Sanchaung area of the city, there were sporadicclashes between protesters and police, who reportedly used tear gasand firearms. It was not immediately clear if there were casualtiesin those clashes.   Throughout last week, students held anti-government rallies atthe university and put up posters that demanded the legalization ofstudent unions and the release of students who had been detained inearlier protests.   Several days of student unrest at Rangoon universities climaxedon March 18 with anti-government riots that police and militaryunits rapidly crushed.   According to diplomatic sources in Bangkok, Thailand, as many as100 people may have died in the March 18 violence. The governmentsaid two students were shot by riot police.</TEXT></DOC>
