<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0223 </DOCNO><TEXT>The combination of synchrotron radiation and time-of-flight electron spectroscopywas used to study the photoionization dynamics of atoms (Li) and smallmolecules (SF{sub 6}, SiF{sub 4}, and SO{sub 2}). Partial cross sectionsand angular distribution asymmetry parameters were measured for Augerelectrons and photoelectrons as functions of photon energy. Emphasisis on the basic understanding of electron correlation and resonant effectsas manifested in the photoemission spectra for these systems. Photoemissionresults for the 1s main line and 1sn1 satellites (n = 2-5) of atomicLi provide a testing ground for the inclusion of many-electron effectsin the theoretical treatment of the simplest open-shell atom. In addition,decay of the doubly excited state 1s(3s3p) of the neutral has also beenstudied; cross-section profiles for both the 1s2s main lines and the1s2p conjugate satellites are reported. A number of effects were investigatedin the photoionization continua of the molecules SF{sub 6}, SiF{sub 4},and SO{sub 2}: autoionization, continuum shape resonances, and EXAFS(extended x-ray absorption fine structure).</TEXT></DOC>
