Analysts said they expected the measures to boost corporate profits, share prices and investment expenditure. The cost to the government in lower tax revenue and new outlays is expected to be about 10 billion francs ($1.59 billion) a year, an expense the government is in a position to accept because of surprisingly strong economic growth that has swelled its revenues.    The rate on reinvested corporate profits will fall to 39% next year, compared with the 42% rate currently applied to all corporate earnings.    Most of the other measures were meant to help small and medium-sized companies create jobs. The government had been expected to favor this sector of the economy, where the potential for creating new jobs and exports is thought to be the highest.    Payroll taxes paid by employers will fall to 7% from 9% over two years, and new companies will be exempt from payroll taxes for two years. New companies also won't pay any coporate tax for two years and will receive discounts of 75% in the third year, 50% in the fourth and 25% in the fifth.    The government also plans to earmark 15 billion francs to help small and medium-sized companies with short-term financing at interest rates of around 9%, compared with current borrowing costs as high as 13%.    Measures aimed specifically at the unemployed center on an extension of job-training programs and other educational initiatives. </TEXT></DOC>
