An administration official said that Treasury Secretary James Baker and Mr. Volcker see &quot;exactly eye-to-eye on the dollar,&quot; both on what is happening in the currency markets and on the consequences of further changes in the dollar's value, in either direction.    The two men &quot;have the same view of the adverse consequences if the dollar should fall too steep and too far,&quot; the official said. He added that the &quot;only difference&quot; between them is that Mr. Volcker &quot;is free to opine on the appropriate level of the dollar and we in the administration are not.&quot; Mr. Baker has been saying routinely that the dollar's value should be set by the foreign-exchange markets.    The official's remarks were intended to counter suggestions by some analysts that the two men are split over dollar policy and that Mr. Baker is trying to drive down the value of the dollar. Mr. Baker has repeatedly denied such speculation, which has in the past sharply lowered the dollar.    Mr. Volcker warned Congress earlier this week that the dollar had declined far enough, and added that history is filled with examples where countries deliberately allowed their currencies to slide too far and found it eventually proved counterproductive. He said too sharp a drop could exacerbate inflation in the U.S., force interest rates to rise and plunge the economy into a recession.    The Fed chairman particularly warned against allowing the dollar to fall unfettered until the trade deficit finally begins to decline -- a prescription attributed to some White House officials recently.    But the administration official indicated yesterday that Mr. Volcker's more-cautious view is shared as well by Secretary Baker. He said Mr. Volcker was &quot;parroting&quot; the Treasury secretary's view.    The official also warned that the U.S. economy appears likely to grow more rapidly than that of West Germany and Japan -- a development that would do more to encourage import-buying by America than by its trading partners and could blunt potential improvement in the U.S. trade balance.    The official said latest projections show the U.S. economy likely to grow at a 3.2% annual rate, with West Germany edging along at a 2.5% pace and Japan's economy relatively flat. &quot;That is not a situation that will help reduce the trade deficit,&quot; he said.    His remarks came as, separately, senior officials of the U.S. and its major economic allies continued negotiations on whether to hold a meeting in the next few days or weeks of finance officials from the so-called Group of Five -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- to discuss the dollar's slide and their outsized trade imbalances.    The U.S. has been trying to arrange such a session in hopes of working out an accord to stabilize the dollar, in exchange for some further economic-stimulus measures by West Germany and Japan. However, monetary sources said no firm decisions had been made.    U.S. officials believe the trade problem can't be solved unless West Germany and Japan spur more demand at home so they can absorb more of the world's exports. Mr. Baker told Congress last week he thought allowing the dollar to fall too far could crimp the economies of those countries and actually thwart any attempts to spur their economic growth.    On a related issue, the official indicated that the Reagan administration is not yet ready to accept the new trade bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee leaders. But he said the bill is sufficiently free of protectionist provisions to serve as a basis for negotiations with Congress.    While stopping well short of endorsing the bill, the official said it was &quot;not nearly as offensive&quot; as the trade legislation that the House passed last year. He said the administration would review the measure in more detail before deciding how to respond. </TEXT></DOC>
