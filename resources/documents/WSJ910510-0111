The kindlingfor the violent reaction, however, may have less to do withthe police or Hispanic complaints about a largely black-runcity than it does with the larger plight of immigrants inAmerica.   The neighborhood not far from downtown Washington has agreat concentration of immigrants from Central America,mostly from Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Manyinevitably are here illegally, but even Hispanics here&quot;legally&quot; bear the burden of the 1986 immigration law thatcriminalized the hiring of undocumented workers.</LP><TEXT>   The bill backed by Senator Alan Simpson for the first timeput the burden on employers to guarantee that workers were inthe U.S. legally. Employers in the Washington-area restaurantand hotel businesses were leading employers of Hispanicsuntil several of these companies became key targets forImmigration and Naturalization Service raids. The INS pickedD.C.-area firms as national examples of what happens toemployers who hire illegal workers. In addition to fines,employers can now go to jail for agreeing to hire an illegalworker.   It didn't take long for employers to figure out that theirchoice often came down to discriminating or risking troublewith the feds. Hispanic groups have cited the INS crackdownin the Washington area, and by now resentment against theimmigration agency is palpable in Mount Pleasant. When wordgot out that the INS was helping police check the backgroundsand identities of those arrested, area residents wereoutraged. &quot;Whatever we can do to keep calm is what we need todo,&quot; Mayor Sharon Pratt Davis said yesterday. &quot;To the extentthat it might inflame passions, then I would prefer {the INS}not do that at this time.&quot; An INS spokesman promised that theagency was not checking out the citizenship of arrestedHispanics for possible deportation, but there is skepticism.   There can be no excuse for violence or rioting. This uglyepisode is a reminder, however, that we only add to theburdens of urban living when we make it harder for immigrantsto find and keep jobs. As city officials try to come to gripswith what happened in Mount Pleasant, federal officials andpoliticians need to reconsider an immigration bill that onlycontributes to resentments.</TEXT></DOC>
