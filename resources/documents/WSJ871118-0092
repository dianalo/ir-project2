A seriously weakened presidency is an undesirable, and potentially dangerous, condition. The blame for this result is widespread. It was a clear goal of congressional Democrats who now measure their prospects in terms of a popular President's decline. But it is also the result of a timid administration that staged a flabby defense both of its policies and the authority of the presidency.    Republican dissidents on the Iran-Contra committees have now offered a blueprint for reinvigorating the presidency while also spotting the issues that should dominate the 1988 elections. Their minority dissent from the larger report scheduled for release today tackles the difficult questions. It deals at length with the key issue of separation of powers. &quot;There was no constitutional crisis, no systematic disrespect for the 'rule of law,' no grand conspiracy and no administration-wide dishonesty or cover up,&quot; conclude Reps. Cheney, Broomfield, Hyde, Courter, McCollum and DeWine and Senators McClure and Hatch.    The minority report agrees with the point made in these columns that the arms sales and diversion were fully within the constitutional authority of the executive branch. &quot;The administration did proceed legally in pursuing both its Contra policy and the Iran arms initiative,&quot; the report says. It adds new evidence from the legislative history that the National Security Council was not covered by the Boland amendments, their constitutionality aside.    The minority report goes on to say, &quot;It is important to stress, however, that the administration could have avoided every one of the legal problems it inadvertently encountered, while continuing to pursue the exact same policies as it did.&quot; The report makes a crucial observation that the White House still misses: &quot;The President's inherent constitutional powers are only as strong as the President's willingness to defend them.&quot;    The big mistake the White House made was to roll over. Mr. Reagan could, and should, have said when he first disclosed the affair that he was unaware of the diversion, but that it was fully within the power of his officials. There was no need for him to offer up the scalps of Ollie North and John Poindexter, invite criminal and congressional investigations and encourage the criminalizing of policy differences. The Republicans note that the hearing's &quot;j'accuse atmosphere&quot; helped &quot;lay bare the passions that animated too much of the committee's work.&quot; But the damage to Mr. Reagan was done.    House Speaker Jim Wright's secretary-of-state act makes the minority's section on congressional micromanagment very timely. &quot;When Congress is narrowly divided over highly emotional issues,&quot; the congressmen note, &quot;it frequently ends up passing intentionally ambiguous laws or amendments that postpone the day of decision.&quot; In the current budget anarchy, foreign-policy edicts such as the five Boland amendments are mere jots and tittles in continuing resolutions. Their report calls for the line-item veto: &quot;Matters of war and peace are too important to be held hostage to governmental decisions about funding Medicare or highways.&quot;    In retrospect, it's clear that President Reagan should have vetoed the continuing resolutions that carried the Boland amendments -- not only because they are unconstitutional, but because the veto remains a potent exercise of executive power. A veto would have forced a national debate on Nicaragua years ago, which the White House could have won.    As it is, the country now witnesses the sour harvest of a weakened presidency. The Contras face a Wright-Ortega challenge to their right to exist, much less to any prospect of funding. Robert Bork, the most qualified person named to the Supreme Court in decades, is defeated by a smear campaign. House Ways and Means proposes new anti-stock taxes that invite a bear market. The Gephardt Smoot-Hawley amendment refuses to die. The markets are roiled, and our allies fret about the on-rushing INF treaty.    The proper functioning of the United States requires all three branches of government to be in working order. It is doubtful that this particular Congress will allow its institutional interests to take a back seat to the general interests of the country. Mr. Reagan must stand up, dust himself off, and get back into the fight for the presidency. </TEXT></DOC>
