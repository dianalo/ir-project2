GE Vice Chairman Lawrence Bossidy also told the analyststhat the company continues to &quot;look optimistically&quot; at 1991.The company issued a separate statement in response toinquiries following Westinghouse Electric Corp.'sannouncement that problems at its financial services unitwill force it to take a $975 million pretax charge in thefourth quarter. GE also has a large financial services unit.   GE declared: &quot;While 1991 is a year of enormous globaluncertainty, GE's leading global businesses, substantiallong-cycle backlogs, widespread productivity, and strongfinancial condition all combine to position the company todeal effectively with the uncertainties.&quot;   The improved performance in Power Systems will result fromincreasing worldwide demand for electricity and the need toreplace aging power plants, GE officials said. DelWilliamson, vice president and general manager of GEIndustrial andamp; Power Systems, estimated that 230 billion wattsof uncommitted additional capacity will be needed in the U.S.through the year 2005. More than half of that will be neededbetween now and the end of the decade. He said internationalmarkets will require an additional 560 billion watts beforethe end of the century.   He said Japan, Korea and Taiwan -- countries where GE hasa strong presence -- will account for about 80% of the powergeneration market over the next decade.   Mr. Williamson said the Gulf war has created someimmediate opportunities for GE Power Generation because ofpower plant equipment damaged or destroyed by the war. &quot;GE isalready holding talks with interested parties,&quot; he said.   The aging of GE-installed gas and steam turbines, boilingwater reactors and delivery equipment provides the companywith an opportunity to sell parts, upgrades and services.
