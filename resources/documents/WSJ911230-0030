In 1986, theEnvironmental Protection Agency banned its use in plumbingmaterials involved in the installation and repair of drinkingwater systems. Earlier this year, the EPA tightened the leadstandard for public water supplies to 15 parts per billionfrom 50 parts per billion.   Americans still receive an average of 10% to 20% of theirtotal lead intake from drinking water. Lead solder inplumbing is a prime culprit. Experts say accidental anddeliberate misuse of solder by plumbing contractors anddo-it-yourselfers remain serious problems. Home Depot, alarge home-improvement retailer based in Atlanta, recentlystopped selling lead solder in the plumbing departments inits 162 stores.   The National Retail Hardware Association is distributingeducation materials for customers and sales personnel abouthazards of lead solder and lead paint. Many retailers nowpromote lead-free solder made mostly from blends of tin,antimony and copper. The University of Massachussetts atAmherst is developing a lead-abatement training course forpeople who manage municipal and private water systems.   About three-fourths of all private homes built in the U.S.before 1980 contain some lead-based paint. In Baltimore,where more than 2,000 lead-poisoning suits against landlordsare pending, Encapsulation Technologies markets analternative to removing lead paint with chemicals andscrapers: an adhesive coating designed to seal in lead painton walls and woodwork.   The Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club pushfor curbs on the burning of lead-tainted oil, which isdrained from cars and machinery, and used to heat hospitals,schools, offices and apartment buildings.                                                                                                          Bull Moose's Descendant   To Retrace Brazil Journey                                                                                                          THEODORE Roosevelt's great-grandson hopes to rekindle zealfor conservation and call attention to Brazil's threatenedrain forests by leading a risky expedition.   In February, Tweed Roosevelt's group of about 20scientists and adventurers will attempt to retrace a 950-milenavigation of the River of Doubt, from its headwaters nearthe Bolivian border to its confluence with a tributary of theAmazon. If successful, it would be the third such navigationever documented, and the first since 1926.   His conservationist ancestor made the trip in 1914 at age55 and wrote a book about it. One team member died in fiercerapids, another was murdered in a dispute over stolen food,and Mr. Roosevelt himself became so ill with jungle feverthat he begged the others to abandon him. Weakened by thedisease, he died five years later.   The 1992 expedition hopes to collect artifacts from theCinta Larga and Zoro Indian tribes for the American Museum ofNatural History. Using the 1914 book, notes and photographs,the team also will attempt historical comparisons,documenting environmental changes triggered by recentdevelopment of one of the world's most remote regions.                                                                                                          Poses Threat to Trees                                                                                                          GROUND-LEVEL ozone may pose as much of a long-term threatto U.S. forests as acid rain.   Ozone is generated in huge volumes by automobiles andindustrial sites in metropolitan areas. New research showsthat ozone plumes can travel for days without breaking up,reaching forests hundreds of miles away and then interactingrapidly with trees.   Acid rain, in contrast, does its damage gradually throughpersistent accumulation. The National Acid PrecipitationAssessment Program's data show that acid rain doesn't hit allregions because its sources are much more geographicallyconcentrated.   William H. Smith, a professor of forest biology at YaleUniversity, says ozone puts stress on the reproductiveprocesses of trees, and in high concentrations destroysfoliage and root tissues. It also interferes withphotosynthesis, respiration and carbon allocation. As leavesand needles are damaged, trees are weakened and eventuallykilled by such pests as bark beetles and root infections.   Monitoring projects indicate that the worst ozoneexposures in North America occur in the San Bernardino andAngeles National Forests in Southern California, with peaksof 300 to 400 parts per billion. Parks and forests in theOhio River Valley, Appalachia and southern New England alsoare threatened.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          FAR FEWER of those elastic foam &quot;peanuts&quot; used asprotective packing material are winding up in the trash thisseason. The Plastic Loose-Fill Producers' Council started acollection program in July, using a toll-free locator serviceand a network of Mail Boxes Etc. franchised outlets. Theprogram now boasts more than 2,100 collection centers and1,000 phone calls a week. . . . Pacific Gas andamp; Electricfigures its Customer Energy Efficiency program will offsetenough growth in demand by the decade's end to avoid a totalof 18 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. . . . AppleComputer, pioneer of the white box now common in computerpackaging, has switched to brown cardboard to eliminate useof bleaching agents. . . . The Nature Conservancy is teamingup with Hyatt Resorts to promote &quot;responsible environmentaltourism&quot; in Hawaii. The list of programs includesendangered-bird preserves, educational hikes andmarine-mammal classes for children.</TEXT></DOC>
