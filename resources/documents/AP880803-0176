The official Voice of Vietnam radio said the Hanoi governmentwas temporarily suspending its participation in the programs. Itcited as a ``hostile policy'' the State Department's opposition toa move in Congress to establish a low-level diplomatic mission inHanoi.   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley did not retreat from thestand taken by Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur intestifying last month against creation of a so-called U.S. interestsection in the Vietnamese capital.   She said the two sides had agreed that humanitarian issues``should not be linked to broader political questions, such asnormalization or economic aid.''   Mrs. Oakley urged Vietnam to continue its cooperation with theUnited States in trying to account for the nearly 1,800 Americansmissing in action since the Vietnam War.   Sigur had testifed that the Reagan administration opposednormalization of relations with the communist government in Hanoiuntil an acceptable solution was found to Vietnam's militarypresence in neighboring Cambodia.   ``The State Department still continues to make foreign policy,''Mrs. Oakley said.   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach informed retiredU.S. Army Gen. John W. Vessey, President Reagan's special emissary,of Hanoi's decision in a letter Sunday.   The Hanoi radio broadcast described Sigur's testimony asevidence of ``hostile policy'' and said Vietnam ``is compelled tosuspend temporarily'' joint efforts ``in the search and exhumationof remains of missing in actions as well as the resettlement ofcamp inmates in the United States.''   The State Department says it has received about 11,000applications requesting resettlement of former Vietnamese politicalprisoners and their families in the United States. Vietnam said theresettlement could involve hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese.   Thach and Vessey agreed a year ago in Hanoi that Vietnam wouldaccelerate its accounting of the MIAs while the United States wouldhelp with humanitarian programs, such as for those disabled in thewar.   In letters to Vessey last month, Thach promised to try toresolve by the end of the year 70 MIA cases which the United Stateshas given high priority. Thach also welcomed joint excavations forremains.</TEXT></DOC>
