The weapons, the Army's Aquila remotely piloted vehicle and the Air Force's advanced medium-range air-to-air missile, or Amraam, are among 20 the GAO reviewed because of approaching deadlines for the Pentagon to put them in development or production. The GAO is the auditing arm of Congress.    Dina Rasor, director of the Project on Military Procurement, which released the draft report, warned that the Defense Department could be stuck with &quot;costly retrofits or a maintenance nightmare&quot; if the technical flaws aren't eliminated before production. The organization is a Washington-based watchdog group.    The Air Force is scheduled to decide on production of the Amraam in May while the Army has a July deadline on the Aquila. The Aquila is to be solely produced by Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co., a unit of Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed Corp. The Air Force has awarded the primary Amraam contract to Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of Detroit-based General Motors Corp., and named Raytheon Co., Lexington, Mass., as a second source.    The draft report said the Army hasn't yet developed an appropriate forward-looking infrared sensor to help the unmanned drone gather battlefield intelligence in bad weather or at night. The lack of such a device could be serious enough to force the Army to junk the Aquila and look for another kind of pilotless reconnaissance vehicle, the draft said.    The draft also criticized the Aquila program for failing to test the drone against specific performance standards. &quot;That's like a student taking a test without knowing what's passing or failing,&quot; Miss Rasor charged.    A spokesman for Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co., Austin (Texas) Division, developer of the Aquila, said the company had no comment since it hasn't seen the GAO draft report. However, he said that in the past year, &quot;the Aquila system has made remarkable progress.&quot; The company has completed operational testing with a success rate of 92%, he said. &quot;That certainly doesn't sound like a program in trouble,&quot; he said.    The draft said the Air Force risks &quot;costly modifications&quot; if it goes ahead with plans to start partial production of the Amraam before its software is fully proven. The expected cost of the Amraam, which is designed to replace the Sparrow missile, already has jumped to $9 billion from $3.4 billion because of &quot;overly optimistic&quot; estimates and design changes, the draft said.    The Project on Military Procurement warned that the Air Force's plans to manufacture and test the missile concurrently could further inflate its cost.    A spokesman for Hughes Aircraft, the primary contractor for the Amraam, hadn't any immediate comment on the GAO report.    The Air Force said it is rebutting the GAO findings on the Amraam in the final version of the GAO report.    Lt. Col. Craig McNab, an Army spokesman, reported encouraging progress in the Aquila program. &quot;We lost a few drones in earlier tests, but in the last one the Aquila had 176 flights without a single crash,&quot; he said.    The GAO said it has sent copies of the draft report to Sen. Sam Nunn (D. Ga.), the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, and has received comments from the service branches. Raymond Allen, a member of the GAO review team, said a final version of the report will be released soon &quot;with some possible updates on figures and dates.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
