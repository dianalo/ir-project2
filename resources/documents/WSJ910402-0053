The department, which regulates one-fourth of the nation'sretail food supply, plans to coordinate its proposal with theFood and Drug Administration's labeling initiatives.Currently, nutritional labels are required only whenlow-calorie or weight-control claims are made for processedmeat and poultry.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We believe consumers have the right to nutritioninformation,&quot; said Lester Crawford, administrator of thedepartment's Food Safety and Inspection Service. &quot;We want tomake it easier for them to understand and use nutritionlabeling.&quot;   Under a proposal released yesterday, the department wouldrequire meat and poultry processors to list nutritional dataincluding calories, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol,protein and sodium content. Unlike the FDA, the departmentdoesn't propose putting information about sugar and dietaryfiber on the label.   The proposal would establish standard serving sizes forthousands of products, from lunch meats to chicken noodlesoup. It would exempt fresh meat and poultry from mandatorynutrition labeling, opting instead for voluntary distributionof nutritional information at supermarkets and other retailoutlets.   Some consumer advocates, while pleased with the thrust ofthe department's labeling plan, said it conflicts with someproposed FDA regulations and doesn't go far enough. &quot;Too manyquestions are left open by the USDA's proposals,&quot; said EllenHaas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and HealthPolicy. &quot;That could leave consumers open to confusion andmisinformation in the marketplace.&quot;   The concept of mandatory labeling has been embraced by theAmerican Meat Institute, National Cattlemen's Association andother industry groups. &quot;We believe we have a good nutritionstory to tell,&quot; said J. Patrick Boyle, president of the meatinstitute.   The department, seeking to answer consumer concerns aboutinconsistent labeling requirements, plans to use the samestandards as the FDA for such product descriptions as &quot;lowcalorie&quot; or &quot;light,&quot; said James Greene, a departmentspokesman. It also plans to sound out the public on suchdescriptions as &quot;low-fat&quot; and &quot;lean.&quot; The comment period endsJune 3.   Consumer advocates maintain that the department'sserving-size proposal will confuse consumers. Under alabeling law enacted by Congress last year, the FDA isrequired to base serving sizes on the amount of foodcustomarily eaten at one sitting. But the department isconsidering several options, including standard units ofmeasures such as an ounce or recommended amounts for ahealthy diet.   &quot;It will be impossible for consumers to compare thenutritional value of meat and non-meat products,&quot; said BruceSilverglade, an attorney for the Center for Science in thePublic Interest. He also said nutritional labeling should berequired of fresh meat and poultry retailers after 30 monthsif they fail to comply with voluntary disclosure rules.   The department intends to put its regulations into effectby May 1993, the deadline that Congress set for the FDA'smandatory nutritional labeling.</TEXT></DOC>
