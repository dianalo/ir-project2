The linkage was announced by New York-based Turner Corp., thebiggest U.S. general contractor for buildings, and Kumagai Gumi Co.Ltd., one of Japan's big six contractors.   ``Currently we have none (business in Japan), nor do we expectto have any major operations there. It allows us to have a verysmall start, if you will, in Japan,'' said Hal Parmelee, presidentof Turner Construction Co., Turner's U.S. subsidiary.   Parmelee confirmed the linkage was prompted by a diplomaticagreement reached last month that would open the Japaneseconstruction market wider to U.S. contractors. He said it couldalso help Turner get work from Japanese clients in the UnitedStates, although both companies will continue to do someindependent work.   In a more extensive deal, Parsons Corp., a Pasadena,Calif.-based engineering firm, last month announced agreements withJapan's Shimizu Corp. to pursue projects together in Japan and toform a jointly owned Japanese company.   Turner and Kumagai Gumi have already worked together on threejoint construction ventures in Manhattan with a total value of $215million: Americas Towers, John Jay College of Criminal Justice andHospital for Special Surgery.   Japan's Kansai International Airport project, a subject ofintense negotiation between the United States and Japan, is onethat Turner and Kumagai Gumi said they have ``strong interest inand will initially pursue.''   Kumagai Gumi is about twice the size of Turner. It rankedseventh in the world among general contractors in 1986, whileTurner ranked 193rd, according to ENR, McGraw-Hill Inc.'s weeklyconstruction magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
