He took the oath of office at a Pretoria church as reports spreadthat his government would free jailed black nationalist leaderNelson Mandela next year. Newspapers quoted officials as saying therelease would be part of several moves aimed at drawing blacks intonegotiations on a new constitution.   ``Our goal is a new South Africa, a totally changed South Africa,a South Africa which has rid itself of the antagonisms of the past,a South Africa free of domination or oppression in whatever form,''de Klerk, 53, said during the swearing-in ceremony.   A leading anti-apartheid activist, the Rev. Allan Boesak, said hewould give de Klerk six months to prove that blacks' skepticismtoward him is unfounded.   ``If he does not move by then, our fears will be tragicallyfulfilled,'' said Boesak, president of the World Alliance ofReformed Churches. ``If he does move, then I think we might findourselves in a situation where one may begin to be hopeful.''   De Klerk said his government would move to eliminatediscriminatory laws, give ``urgent attention'' to adopting a bill ofrights and release prisoners such as Mandela if that would promotepeaceful solutions.   He said he hoped to ``gradually move away'' from the 3-year-oldstate of emergency, which has severed restricted militantanti-apartheid activity.   ``Protest regarding past injustice, or alleged injustice, doesnot bring us closer to a solution. Nor does unrest or violence,'' hesaid. ``There is but one way to peace, to justice for all: that isthe way of reconciliation.''   He reiterated his vision of a new political system in which thenow-voteless black majority would be able to participate withoutdominating the white minority, and he cautioned against unreasonableexpectations for his program.   De Klerk's eyes watered when a minister preaching at theswearing-in ceremony urged him to press forward without fear. ChiefJustice Michael Corbett administered the oath of office before about1,500 people in a Dutch Reformed Church near the University ofPretoria.   In an indication of South Africa's international isolation, noforeign heads of state were present.   As the ceremony began, a group of human rights lawyers inPretoria announced that de Klerk had commuted the death sentences ofseven prisoners on Death Row.   It was the second time in five weeks that de Klerk took the oath.He became acting president on Aug. 15, a day after the Cabinetforced President P.W. Botha to resign after his 11 years in power.   De Klerk did not mention Mandela by name in his speech, but saidsecurity prisoners would be released if public order was notthreatened and prospects for peace could be enhanced.   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentencealong with other leaders of the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla movement for plotting anti-government sabotage.   Since succeeding Botha, de Klerk has repeatedly stressed the needfor speedy reform and has called white domination of the blackmajority unfair.   His National Party lost seats to both the left and right inelections Sept. 6, but retained its parliamentary majority on aplatform calling for a vote for blacks on the national level by 1994.   Although he has spoken out against discrimination, De Klerkopposes outright black majority rule, and favors segregatedneighborhoods and schools for whites who want them.   His personal style, conciliatory and affable, translated intoimmediate political gain when he declared that police would nolonger interfere with peaceful anti-government protests.   Last week, tens of thousands of people of all races participatedin two of the largest marches in South African history.   Some of his staunchest black opponents praised de Klerk'sdecision, seen as an attempt to defuse bitterness and encourageblack leaders to negotiate with the government.   But under the state of emergency, which grants police almostunlimited powers to limit freedom of speech, press and assembly,police continued to detain black leaders without charge while themarches went on.   Throughout his 17 years in politics, including 10 years in theCabinet, de Klerk has been a low-key, loyal supporter of theNational Party and a policy of gradual, limited reforms.   De Klerk practiced law before entering Parliament in 1973. From1978, he held a series of Cabinet posts and in 1982 took on thepowerful job of National Party leader in Transvaal, South Africa'smost populous and wealthy province.   De Klerk and his, Marike, wife have three children.</TEXT></DOC>
