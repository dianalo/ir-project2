<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-1418 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method of washing NO and/or SO/sub 2/ out of waste gases such as fluegases is described, which operates with iron(II) salts in non-aqeoussolvents. Solvents used are, e.g., monoethers or diethers of oligoethyleneglycol or oligopropylene glycol, DMSO, glycerol, phosphoric acid ester,acetonyl acetone, etc. The scrubbing liquid can be regenerated, afterhaving been charged, simply by warming and/or pressure reduction, afterwhich the scrubbing liquid is again ready for use, without any furtherchemicals being needed in addition to the already applied iron(II) salts.The process permits the wash-out of NO or NO/sub x/, either alone, ortogether with SO/sub 2/. If SO/sub 2/ alone is to be washed out of agas mixture, the addition of iron(II) salts is unnecessary.</TEXT></DOC>
