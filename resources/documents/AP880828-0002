Hungarian Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said RomanianPresident Nicolas Ceausescu was receptive to the idea of Hungarysending a team to Romania to examine the village demolition andresettlement project.   Grosz was interviewed by Hungarian television and radio from thetown of Szeged near the Romanian border. He was returning toHungary after more than eight hours of talks with Ceausescu in theRomanian city of Arad, 25 miles from the frontier.   But Grosz indicated relations between the Warsaw Pact allies arestill strained, saying it had been agreed that consular offices ofthe two countries would not be reopened.   Last week Hungarian authorities described as ``a crime againsthumanity'' Ceausescu's plan to demolish 7,000 of Romania's 13,000villages and to resettle the inhabitants, many of them ethnicHungarians.   Hungarians have long said the estimated 1.7 million ethnicHungarians in Romania are discriminated against and theannouncement by Ceausescu in March that the village demolition andresettlement project should be completed by the year 2000 drewfierce criticism here.   Hungary claims the project, which would resettle villagers intoagro-industrial centers, wiould destroy ethnic culture andtraditions.   Grosz said the nationality question dominated about one third ofSunday's talks and the resettlement plan was a ``major question ofcourse.''   He said his delegation proposed that Hungary send a delegationmade up of local council officials, members of Parliament andCommunist Party workers to look at the resettlement plans and ``seefor themselves how the program is shaping up.''   Grosz indicated progress on the issue of reunification offamilies separated by nationality policies. He said more than17,000 Romanians, presumably of Hungarian orgin, have sought refugein Hungary.   ``If there are family reunion requests they (the Romanians) willbe partners to it,'' Grosz said. ``This is something that theypromised.''   He said Hungary agreed to drop the issue of reopening consulatesand cultural centers because of Romania's ``position of principle ... to close every kind of consulate.''   Following a demonstration by some 50,000 people in Budapest inJune, Ceausescu reacted by closing Hungary's consulate inCluj-Napoca in Transylvania where many members of the Hungarianminority live.   Grosz said the next high-level bilateral meeting would be heldin 1989. ``There is a lot we don't know about each other andignorance will not broaden ties,'' he said.   The meeting Sunday was the first Romanian-Hungarian summit since1977 when Ceausescu met Grosz' predecessor Janos Kadar.   Ceausescu, who surprised the Hungarians Thursday with hisinvitation to the talks, called them a new beginning that started``in a positive way,'' according to a Hungarian radio broadcast.
