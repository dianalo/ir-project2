Azcona said more than $1 billion had left the country in thelast nine years, most of it deposited in U.S. banks.   He blamed the capital flight on regional conflicts that plagueCentral America.   ``The uncertain panorama of Central America has badly damagedHonduras, one of the few nations in the region which lives indemocracy and relative tranquility,'' Azcona said.   There are no restrictions on the taking of capital out ofHonduras.   Honduras is not involved in civil war, but neighbors such as ElSalvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua are, and Honduras has become ahaven for both refugees and guerrillas.   Azcona said that the ``situation confronting the region provokesfear and insecurity in local and foreign investors.''   ``Because of this more than $1 billion has been deposited inforeign bank accounts, specifically in the United States, by manyHondurans in the last few years,'' he said.   He said the majority of Honduran businessmen have bank accountsin the United States of between $200,000 and $300,000.   He spoke in an interview with Radio America, one of the mainnetworks in Honduras.   ``If our compatriots would return only 25 percent of thiscapital, which would be about $250 million, it would partiallysolve the problems that confront Honduras,'' the president said.   Honduras is ranked by many international organizations as one ofthe poorest nations in the hemisphere. It suffers 30 percentunemployment, a budget deficit of more than $300 million and aninflation rate of 30 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
