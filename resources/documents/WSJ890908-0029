The suit, filed in a state court in Eureka, Calif., by three members of the Murphy family, seeks more than $18 million in damages and requests a jury trial.    The suit charges that the Murphy family members were forced to sell their shares at $40 each, well below what it calls their &quot;true&quot; value of more than $70 each, because of fraud by Drexel and others in connection with the takeover of Pacific Lumber by Maxxam Corp., a company controlled by Mr. Hurwitz. At the time, the suit says, the members of the Murphy family held 600,000 shares.    Last October, four other former shareholders of Pacific Lumber filed a $2.25 billion suit in federal court in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate the takeover. The holders also filed a similar suit in state court in Eureka.    Drexel has agreed since then to settle Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges by paying the government $650 million and pleading guilty to six felony counts not related to Pacific Lumber. The federal suit filed in Los Angeles has been consolidated with about 15 other suits against Drexel, Mr. Boesky and Mr. Milken in a federal court in New York.    A Drexel spokesman said, &quot;We haven't been served with the suit, so we don't have any comment.&quot;    Mr. Milken, Drexel's former junk-bond chief, is under federal criminal indictment on stock-fraud and racketeering charges. He couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Boesky, once a prominent Wall Street arbitrager, was sent to prison for insider trading. </TEXT></DOC>
