Bush summoned Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the chairman of theSenate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, thevice chairman, following a week of congressional criticism aboutthe way the administration handled the abortive uprising.   The president ``has the highest respect for the judgment andintegrity'' of the two ``and wanted to take this occasion toreaffirm the close working relationship with Sens. Boren and Cohenand the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,'' a White Housestatement said.   Also present at the 35-minute meeting, where Bush thanked Borenfor his bipartisan leaderhsip on foreign policy, were chief ofstaff John Sununu, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft andScowcroft's deputy, Robert Gates.   Scowcroft and Boren had clashed during televised interviewsSunday, with the senator saying his committee had given Busheverything he sought regarding Panama, and Scowcroft disputing thatstatement.   Backing away from Scowcroft's stand, a senior administrationofficial said today that Boren and Scowcroft talked about thematter after the interviews and agreed they on the same track.``General Scowcroft had no disagreement with Senator Boren'sstatement,'' said the official, who declined to be identified.   The official said Boren and Cohen have been cooperative with theadministration on Panama, and today's meeting was intended tocement the relationship and ``repair any damage.''   Meanwhile, State Department officials have been debriefing someof the members of the Panamanian Defense Forces who had tried totopple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Oct. 3.   Among the 42 Panamanians the United States flew to Miami onSaturday was Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be thehighest-ranking participant in the coup to escape capture, said oneadministration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Family members of slain coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi alsowere in the group, State Department spokesman Rich Sanders saidTuesday. He would not confirm whether the group included Giroldi'swidow, Adela Bonilla Giroldi, a key intermediary between U.S.officials and the coup plotters.   ``These people definitely have good reason to be out ofPanama,'' Sanders said. ``Noriega's proven willingness to use forceagainst people, murder people, is a matter of record.'' Giroldi wasshot in the aftermath of the coup, by some accounts at Noriega'sown hand.   In the wake of strong congressional criticism of Bush's reactionto the coup attempt, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney complainedTuesday that interference by members of Congress undermined theadministration's ability to handle the crisis.   Also, an administration official said that Bush, unhappy oversecond-guessing about the way the United States handled the coupattempt, ordered top officials last Friday to put a halt tointernal criticism. ``A lot of it (internal criticism) was comingfrom people who didn't have the full picture,'' said the official,who declined to be identified.   State Department representatives have been debriefing the coupparticipants who were given sanctuary in this country, officialssaid.   Officials in Washington gave few details about plans for thePanama Defense Forces members who were housed temporarily in aMiami hotel.   ``They are coup members and their families,'' White House PressSecretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday, adding that revealingtheir identities could endanger them. The group was received by theU.S. Catholic Conference.   Mark Franken, assistant director of refugee services for theU.S. Catholic Conference in New York, said his organization assuredthe Panamanians their whereabouts would not be disclosed.   It is expected that arrangements will be made for those who wantto settle in this country, officials said.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service was ready to reviewapplications for political asylum from the group ``if such requestsare made,'' according to State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler.   In an interview with The Associated Press, Cheney complainedthat during the coup attempt, ``We had situations here wheremembers of Congress were literally calling (executive branch)agencies downtown, or even people in Panama, as these eventsunfolded, demanding information. That creates all kinds ofproblems.''   Cheney also said some members of Congress made public commentsbased on inaccurate information, such as the assertion that Noriegawas offered to U.S. officials.   However, Fitzwater said, ``We don't have any specificcomplaints'' about congressional interference in foreign affairs,particularly in Panama.   The Pentagon said there had been dissension among the coupleaders about how to handle Noriega when he was in custody of thecoup participants on Oct. 3.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said an unnamed officer takingpart in the coup insisted that Noriega should be given to theUnited States and argued with Giroldi who ``had no intention,ever'' of taking that course.</TEXT></DOC>
