Rose (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WGO </CO><IN> PRO AUT </IN><DATELINE> FOREST CITY, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Life in this quiet town has long moved to the rhythm of the changing seasons and the factory whistle. Most of the 4,300 residents prize simple pleasures -- family, friends and the great outdoors. The largest employer fits right in: Winnebago Industries Inc., the maker of motor homes for vacation travelers.    Life for Gerald Gilbert and Richard Berreth, on the other hand, has always been a fairly supercharged thing. Fast-track vice presidents of Control Data Corp. up in Minneapolis, they chased fame and fortune in the high-tech, high-stakes computer game for 17 years, often bossing more people in one operation than live in this whole community. Along the way, though, it became a bit less fun.    So, in 1986, the two type-A executives chucked their fancy careers and headed for Forest City. At the time, it seemed to be a mid-life fantasy come true: First Mr. Gilbert became Winnebago's chief executive; later his pal, Mr. Berreth, became executive vice president. Together they prepared to head up a Fortune 500 company while enjoying a tranquil country life. Mr. Gilbert was even looking forward to a promised free Winnebago after three years.    As it turned out, the two adventurers should have stayed in the big city. For they recently learned just how powerful a way of life -- and one individual's loyalty to his neighbors -- can be in a town like this.    There was no question the couple of top-flight executives could bring more modern management and manufacturing to Winnebago's sprawling plant here. The factory was probably as advanced as any in the industry, but Messrs. Gilbert and Berreth had a potful of new ideas. Things like &quot;statistical process control&quot; and &quot;mixed model production&quot; and &quot;work cells&quot; to streamline the way slab-sided Winnebago freeway yachts were built.    &quot;The opportunity was just unbelievable,&quot; recalls Mr. Gilbert. Mr. Berreth remembers fantasizing that the new Winnebago one day might be the stuff of a business-school study proving that a company could dominate a low-tech, cottage industry by adopting modern production techniques.    Alas, they probably should have devoted a little more thought to Winnebago's past. The company had a history of carnage at the top, running through five different chief executives in the 14 years before Messrs. Gilbert and Berreth strolled into town. In one of those shake-ups, Winnebago's chairman and founder, John K. Hanson, sacked his own son.    Mr. Hanson is known here as just plain &quot;John K.&quot; And John K. is a local hero. He founded Winnebago out behind his farm implement dealership in 1958, eventually bringing boom times to Forest City, creating a splash back east on Wall Street and making millionaires out of some hometown folk who bought stock when Winnebago went public in 1965. The 3,300-employee payroll pumps more than $1 million a week into the local economy.    Mr. Hanson, now 75 years old, has been promising to ease his grip on the helm. But he still works a full morning, heading home at noon for lunch and a nap before returning on most days for another hour's work. A favorite activity is investing Winnebago money. He boasts he made $1 million playing &quot;the upsies and downsies&quot; of Ford stock over the last year. And at his urging, Winnebago acquired Cycle Sat, a company developing satellite transmission of commercials from ad agencies to television stations -- a far cry from products that carry names like Superchief and Chieftain.    In any event, what Mr. Gilbert says he found when he arrived was a factory for these products &quot;still in the Dark Ages.&quot; Excess inventory, outdated design methods, few standardized parts. &quot;There were something like 800 different cabinet doors, some an eighth of an inch apart&quot; in measurements, Mr. Gilbert says.    He quickly called friend and ally Mr. Berreth to help. Mr. Berreth made Control Data factories run on time -- during the 1970s and early 1980s managing key computer component-making operations employing between 2,000 and 7,200 people. He seemed, says Thomas Farmer, a Winnebago director, &quot;a real manufacturing genius.&quot; Mr. Berreth, a tall muscular man and mechanical engineer, figures factories have to adapt or die. &quot;In the high-tech world,&quot; he says, &quot;people were pretty well accustomed to the fact that they had to change to survive.&quot;    Not here.    A motor home is essentially a studio apartment on wheels, and just 60,000 are sold industrywide each year. So mass production is a relative notion. A typical Winnebago starts out as a Chevrolet-powered truck chassis, stretched a bit, with some outriggers added to hold storage bins, wiring and plumbing. On the assembly line, it gets a floor and carpet, lower cabinets and walls, a roof and doors.    By the time the Gilbert-and-Berreth team arrived with a plan for modernized production, some workers were predicting just another limited management engagement. &quot;There was an attitude, initially,&quot; Mr. Berreth says, &quot;that these guys won't be around very long.&quot;    Nonetheless, he and his wife settled in. They joined the choir at the nearby Clear Lake Evangelical Free Church. She enrolled in a local college. He started adding to the house.    He also settled into work. He attacked inventory costs by demanding that the most heavily used components be unloaded from trucks and taken directly to the assembly line. He made employee teams responsible for the quality of a particular assembly job from start to finish. And he cut in half the total time from the manufacture of the first part of a motor home to its final assembly.    Then the stock market crashed. Mr. Hanson had the company heavily invested, and it took an $8.6 million beating. Mr. Gilbert recalls being &quot;hammered pretty hard by Wall Street&quot; over Winnebago's aggressive investing and curious diversification into Cycle Sat, even though he didn't have much to say over it. &quot;That was an area John K. liked to call his own,&quot; he says.    Worse, recreational vehicle dealers stopped placing orders.    With sales off, however, it seemed the perfect time for Mr. Berreth's big move: merging three assembly lines into two. That would make room for an ambitious sub-assembly operation in which workers would attach appliances and cabinets to the walls of the vehicles before they were hoisted onto the assembly line.    The time-honored method calls for installing interior equipment after the walls are up. That means everything goes in through the windows or the side door, with a line of workers waiting to lug appliances and cabinets through the narrow passageway inside the vehicle. And things are constantly dinged and dented.    The merged lines went well until April, when the honeymoon ended. Orders picked up in a big way. Yet at that moment, the new team was making yet another change: switching from batch production -- 50 of these, 100 of those -- to a mixed run in which any of 58 models could be next down the line.    &quot;We're a bunch of old-fashioned people around here,&quot; declares Charles Grandon, a 14-year employee. Before, workers easily fell into a pace to match the batch of vehicles at hand. Now with every model down the line different, so were the tasks. It was confusing. And frustrating. Take roofs. &quot;You'd do a 24, a 31, a 24, a 31, then a 24 again,&quot; he says, referring to model lengths.    Also, closing one line meant crowding workers together on the other two. As orders and production picked up, these grew more jammed. Then overtime became mandatory, including Saturdays.    &quot;Not much left for the family life,&quot; recalls Sandy Niles, a Winnebago painter with two young children.    New models were being rushed into production. &quot;Quality is chief on this reservation,&quot; said the signs over the line. But it wasn't. Holes in parts didn't line up; fasteners couldn't be inserted. Parts weren't ready. A parking lot began filling with almost-finished motor homes.    &quot;Too many things at once,&quot; complains Jerry Steffen, on the assembly line five years.    All this as a summer heat wave seared the Midwest. With no air conditioning in the factory, temperatures flirted with 100 degrees. Tempers flared, morale plummeted and epithets were scrawled on plant walls. Some workers punched holes and ripped up carpets. Some quit.    Re-enter John K.    He was angry about what was happening to his employees -- &quot;my dumb farmers,&quot; he calls them. &quot;This work force wouldn't tolerate what {Messrs. Berreth and Gilbert} did,&quot; says Mr. Hanson. &quot;Ten hours a day, six days a week in hot weather. They were pooped out.&quot;    He was angry about what was happening to his products. Dealers warned he was being &quot;sabotaged.&quot; Among vehicles delivered to dealer lots was one marked &quot;Don't Ship,&quot; and another with an unexpected feature: a wrench apparently thrown in by a disgruntled worker. &quot;You can't deliver it if it's no good,&quot; John K. says.    And he was real angry about what was happening to sales and profits. The industry was headed toward record volume, and Winnebago had a hot new model. Problems delayed it two months. &quot;We missed sales,&quot; says Dave Altman in Baldwin Park, Calif., the company's biggest dealer.    Winnebago now estimates the lost business for the summer at about 1,000 motor homes. A doubling of Winnebago's 40-cent-a-share annual dividend had to be delayed, and along with it a doubling of Mr. Hanson's personal $5 million-a-year dividend income. (His 1987 salary was $259,252.)    &quot;It all came together in my office,&quot; Mr. Berreth now acknowledges. Many thought Mr. Gilbert should fire his old friend, and that thought occurred to Mr. Berreth, too: &quot;If he would have given me the ax he could have saved his own skin.&quot;    Instead, Mr. Gilbert issued a three-page statement written by the company's public relations man, promising to drop some of the new-fangled methods. He admitted &quot;management errors.&quot; He pledged to ease up on overtime and reduce the number of models. And he promised more careful planning &quot;so we do not overwhelm design, engineering and production resources, like we did this year. . . .&quot;    It wasn't enough. John K. had lost patience. In late September, he polled his board, and fired the Control Data team. Sort of. Actually he had the company lawyer fire them. It had been a long day, and Mr. Hanson went home.    &quot;John likes to avoid confrontation,&quot; Mr. Gilbert says. </TEXT></DOC>
