Two principalcases are examined: (i) two-dimensional offset jets: and (ii) three-dimensionalflow induced in rooms by supply jets emanating from low or high side-wallregisters. The calculations were undertaken using iterative finite-domainprocedures which solve the conservation equations for mass, momentumand enthalpy, together with additional transport equations for the turbulentkinetic energy and its dissipation rate. The effect of buoyancy was explicitlyaccounted for when modelling these equations, in order that they couldbe employed to simulate buoyant flow in ventilated rooms. Computationsof the mean velocity, temperature and convective heat transfer distributionare reported, and compared with experimental data where available.</TEXT></DOC>
