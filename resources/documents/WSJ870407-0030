The Akron, Ohio-based concern said it initially will finance the purchase of as many as 12.5 million of its 22.3 million shares outstanding with bank loans, but that it plans to sell assets with a total value of about $1.4 billion after taxes over the next 18 months. A company spokesman said GenCorp also has outstanding 740,000 warrants that are convertible into common shares.    The company said it plans to sell its tire-manufacturing and soft-drink-bottling businesses, and to step up efforts to sell broadcasting properties that have challenged licenses. Also, GenCorp said it will launch a cost-cutting program, including staff reductions, at its remaining aerospace and plastics subsidiaries.    GenCorp unveiled its plan in the wake of a $2.3 billion, or $100-a-share, tender offer March 18 by a partnership consisting of AFG Industries Inc., Irvine, Calif., and Wagner andamp; Brown, Midland, Texas. GenCorp's board rejected that offer as &quot;inadequate&quot; based on recommendations from its financial advisers. Last Friday, the offering group said it was willing to raise its offer to $110 a share.    A spokesman for General Partners, the AFG/Wagner andamp; Brown group, said the partnership hadn't any immediate comment on the planned stock purchase. He also declined to say whether General Partners would consider raising its offer to as high as $130 a share to match the GenCorp purchase price.    GenCorp's plan received mixed reviews from industry analysts. &quot;I'm very pleased. It's a deal designed to deliver virtually full value to shareholders, and it neutralizes anybody from trying to take over the company,&quot; said Richard L. Haydon, managing director of Brean Murray, Foster Securities Inc.    But Donald F. DeScenza, analyst with Nomura Securities Inc., said: &quot;On the face of it, all they're doing is shrinking the company and they'll end up with a weak balance sheet and negative net worth. I'm not too comfortable with this.&quot;    GenCorp stock closed at $118 a share, up $3 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    The price of GenCorp stock didn't soar on the company's announcement because its offer is expected to be oversubscribed, with shareholders able to sell only a portion of their shares to GenCorp. The situation is expected to be similar to that of Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.'s tender earlier this year for 40 million of its common shares at $50 each. More than twice that number of shares were tendered, causing Goodyear stock to close $6 below the offering price on the day the offer expired.    GenCorp said it arranged for $1.75 billion of financing from a six-bank syndicate led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Chemical Bank for the stock purchase, working capital and other corporate purposes.    GenCorp's board declared the regular quarterly dividend of 37 1/2 cents a share, payable May 31 to stock of record May 4. The board also decided against paying a 2% stock dividend for 1987; GenCorp had been paying such dividends since 1969. In an interview, A. William Reynolds, chairman and chief executive officer, said financing terms don't restrict dividend payments. &quot;But as we go forward we'll have to make regular business judgments&quot; on paying dividends.    In abandoning tire making, the former General Tire andamp; Rubber Co. moves away from its original foundation when it incorporated in 1915.    Mr. Reynolds declined to disclose GenCorp's cost-cutting goal, but he said plans call for reducing staff at the remaining units and &quot;some layoffs over a period of time.&quot; He said a precise goal will be included in a tender document to be circulated later this week. The actual stock purchase probably won't begin until early next month, he said.    GenCorp said the offer isn't conditioned upon any minimum number of shares being tendered. The company said its board determined that its offer is fair and recommends holders to tender all of their GenCorp shares.    The restructured GenCorp's future hinges on its high-technology businesses, which it believes have the greatest growth potential. GenCorp said it expects its aerospace/defense and plastics units to generate pre-tax profit of about $150 million in the company's fiscal year ending Nov. 30, and more than $200 million in fiscal 1988 pre-tax profit, &quot;principally as a result of governmental and automotive original-equipment programs currently committed.&quot;    Aerojet General, GenCorp's aerospace/defense unit, had fiscal 1986 pre-tax profit of $69 million on sales of $861 million. DiversiTech, which makes plastic and rubber automotive parts, wall coverings, and tennis and racquetball balls, had fiscal 1986 pre-tax profit of $78 million on sales of $676 million. Combined, the two businesses accounted for 57% of GenCorp's fiscal 1986 consolidated operating profit.    Mr. Reynolds added that GenCorp expects to receive at least $500 million for its tire-making unit, a figure he said is &quot;in the middle of a broad range.&quot; Already, he said, there &quot;has been some interest expressed&quot; in the unit, which accounted for 36% of GenCorp's fiscal 1986 revenue of $3.1 billion, and 35% of total corporate pretax profit of $225 million.    Mr. Reynolds said, however, that the company also is &quot;considering a range of alternatives,&quot; including a leveraged buyout of the tire-making unit to existing management or taking it public through an offering. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    While Nomura's Mr. DeScenza said he doesn't think &quot;there's a booming market&quot; for GenCorp's tire business, he said it might fetch as much as $600 million, based on a multiple of 11 or 12 times annual net income of about $50 million. He said the most likely buyer of the tire unit would be Japanese concerns, because Japanese auto makers are expanding their U.S. production. Also, Mr. DeScenza said the increase in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar makes it more difficult for the Japanese to export cars and tires to the U.S.    GenCorp's Mr. Reynolds said also the company expects to receive more than $200 million for its soft-drink bottling operations. Previously, the company has said its RKO Pictures unit would bring $40 million and the sale of its New Jersey television station, WOR, to MCA Inc., would add $257 million. GenCorp expects also to receive $217 million from the sale of its Los Angeles television station, KHJ, to Walt Disney Co.    Mr. Reynolds added that GenCorp expects also at least $200 million from the sale of other broadcasting properties, which like KHJ, have challenged licenses. He said he plans to intensify efforts next week to sell those properties. </TEXT></DOC>
