Ms. McKie, among the five alternates excused from the panelThursday, said she thinks President Reagan knew about North'sactivities.   ``I believe Mr. Reagan knew what was going on,'' she told CBS.``I can't say he knew everything, but I think he knew enough toknow what was going on. I mean, you see (national security adviserRobert) McFarlane every week, he's only 100 yards from you or feetfrom you.''   Reagan told the Tower commission on Jan. 26, 1987 that he didnot know that the National Security Council staff was engaged inhelping the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   During two hours of deliberations this morning, the jury sentout requests to the judge for more copies of the jury instructions,pencils, writing paper and paper clips. They also asked when lunchwould be, saying through an emissary that ``we want to get on aschedule.'' Lunch will be at noon each day.   Ms. McKie's comments addressed a central point North has used inhis defense.   The former White House aide testified that he had authorizationfor all his actions in the Iran-Contra affair, including allegedlyobstructing Congress by denying that he was assisting theNicaraguan Contras.   ``Mr. North ... wasn't made to do what he did,'' said Ms. McKie.``He had a choice in it. He had a choice to either say `No, I don'twant to do this' or `yes sir, I will do this' even as it went alongand he knew it was wrong.''   That remark addresses criminal intent, a question that will becentral to the jury's deliberations.   Ms. McKie said she would have voted to convict North on somecharges, acquit him on others, but she emphasized she had notdiscussed the case with other jurors and thus could not say howthey felt.   If convicted on all 12 counts against him, North could facemaximum prison terms totaling 60 years and fines of $3 million.   North testified that he had no idea any of his actions violatedthe law and that he had good motives for what he did.   He said he destroyed a ledger showing how he had spent $300,000in cash on orders of CIA director William Casey because thedocument contained names of Contras leaders and that exposure couldhave endangered their lives. North is accused of illegallyconverting $4,300 from the $300,000 cash fund to his own use.   The jury foreman, Denise Anderson, 34, presides over a group ofnine women and three men chosen for their task 2{ months agobecause they were among the few Americans who hadn't watched, reador heard anything substantial about North's televised testimony in1987.   Ms. Anderson, a hospital employee, was picked for the jury aftertelling lawyers: ``I don't like the news.''   In two hours of instructions Thursday, the 12 jurors were toldto consider only in a narrowly defined context North's assertionthat all his actions were directed by higher-ups includingPresident Reagan .   ``Authorization requires clear, direct instructions to act at agiven time in a given way,'' said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell.   ``It must be specific, not simply a general admonition or vagueexpression of preference.''   Gesell said ``neither the president'' nor North's bosses ``hadthe legal authority to order anyone to violate the law.''   At the same time, the judge encouraged the jury to consider theatmosphere of secrecy that pervaded the Reagan administration inthe Iran-Contra affair.   Emphasizing that ``our country is governed by the rule of law,''Gesell said others ``ranking above or below'' North may haveengaged in the same kind of conduct he did.   ``Some have pled guilty to charges, some await trial, some aredead, others have received immunity in exchange for testifying,''said the judge. ``This evidence was admitted so you would betterunderstand the atmosphere in which, and the circumstances underwhich the defendant was working as these may bear'' on North'sintent.   North's defense that his bosses gave him the go-ahead foreverything he did could apply to as many as eight of the 12criminal charges against him. However, the judge's instructionslikely will curtail its importance in the jurors' deliberations.   Gesell emphasized a number of points that could be favorable toNorth.   The judge pointed out conflicting evidence over whether aproposed congressional resolution of inquiry was pending or notwhen North lied to the House Intelligence Committee in 1986. In theAug. 6, 1986 session, North denied he was assisting the NicaraguanContra rebels. One congressional committee had already voted downthe resolution.</TEXT></DOC>
