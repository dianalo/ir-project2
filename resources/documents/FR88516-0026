Rohde, Classificationand Value Division, (202) 566-2938.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Customs is reviewing its practice of classifying, as an unfinished andunassembled article under General Headnote 10(h), TSUS, imported televisionpicture tubes and television chassis that, while entered together, areseparately packaged and have separate countries of origin. As a resultof the classification of such merchandise as a single tariff entity underitem 684.96, TSUS, a 5 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> duty rate is applicable. A 15 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> duty rate is generally applicable to color televisionpicture tubes, provided for in item 687.35, TSUS. The current practice is based upon a Customs Service ruling, dated November15, 1984 (CLA-2 CO:R:CV:V 553020), which was issued in response to a petitionfiled under section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930. A summation of the rulingwas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 19, 1985 (50 FR 7026). Pursuant toandSection; 177.10(c), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10(c)), prior to publicationof a ruling which changes an established practice and which results inthe assessment of a higher rate of duty, Customs is required to publishthe fact that the practice is under review and to afford interested partiesan opportunity to comment on the contemplated change. In accordance withandSection; 177.10(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10(b)), no rulingwill be published unless the practice has been determined to be clearlywrong. The classification practice is being reviewed upon the referral of a matterto Customs Service Headquarters under internal advice procedures pursuantto 19 CFR 177.11. The factual setting of this matter involves importedcolor television picture tubes and television chassis which enter the U.S.on the same vessel and generally in equal numbers. While the televisiontubes and chassis are technically compatible, at time of importation theyare not assembled to each other, and have different countries of origin,as well as different countries of exportation. Review of the tariff treatmentof such merchandise has brought to light certain factors that previouslymay not have been properly addressed or given adequate consideration. The provision at issue, item 684.96, TSUS, provides for ``Television apparatus,and parts thereof: Television receivers and parts thereof: Having a picturetube: Assemblies (including kits containing all parts necessary for assemblyinto complete receivers: Color.'' In the above-cited ruling of November15, 1984, this provision (then item 685.14, TSUS) was determined to bethe proper classification of color television picture tubes and televisionchassis entered in a manner similar to the matter currently being consideredby Customs Service Headquarters; it was concluded that for tariff classificationpurposes such merchandise was an unfinished article (i.e., an unassembled,unfinished television receiver) within the scope of General Headnote 10(h),TSUS, which provides that ``unless the context requires otherwise, a tariffdescription for an article covers such article whether assembled or notassembled, and whether finished or not finished.''However, in <T3>Nichimen andamp; Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, 565 F. Supp. 148 (CIT 1983), aff'd 726 F. 2d 1580(Fed. Cir. 1984), the court held that certain radio chassis and tape players,covered by the same entry, were not properly classifiable as a single tariffentity. Rather, the chassis and tape players were classifiable separatelybecause they did not comprise a complete commercial entity, requiring assemblywith additional components to form a complete article of commerce.In Customs Service Headquarters Ruling 553020, it was also determined thatthe presence of the language pertaining to ``kits'' in item 684.96, TSUS(then item 685.14), supports a conclusion that at least some of the merchandiseclassifiable therein need not be physically fastened together. However,the ruling did not address the crucial question of whether the same languagein item 684.96, TSUS, by its very terms, precludes the provision from coveringa collection of unassembled parts which does <T3>not </T3>contain all parts necessary for assembly into complete receivers.General Headnote 10(h), TSUS, is inapplicable if it is shown to bring abouta classification that is ``against a specific provision that implementsa policy of Congress, consciously arrived at and clearly stated.'' <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>J. Gerber andamp; Co.</T3>, 58 CCPA 110, 115 (1971). The phrase in item684.96, TSUS, ``including kits containing all parts necessary for assemblyinto complete receivers,'' is a description of the level of completionnecessary before a collection of unassembled parts may be classified inthat provision. Accordingly, the context of the provision would requirea classification of the color television picture tubes and chassis at issuein a provision other than as an ad unfinished and unassembled article,as would otherwise be directed under General Headnote 10(h), TSUS. <T3>Crabtree Vickers, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>79 Cust. 60 1977).Moreover, while 684.96, TSUS, is an <T3>eo nomine </T3>provision for ``assemblies,'' the absence of legal definitionallanguage relating to ``assemblies'' in Part 5, Schedule 6, TSUS, does notnecessarily support a conclusion that ``assemblies'' can include not onlycomplete ``kits,'' but also other collections of unassembled parts. Rather,it is clear that the ``assemblies'' that are not a complete ``kit`` mustbe entities distinguishable other than by merely being collections of unassembledparts that are incomplete or unfinished '`kits.'' Otherwise, the languagein item 684.96, TSUS, providing for ``kits containing all parts necessary''is rendered superfluous, since complete kits would already be contemplatedby virtue of General Headnote 10(h), TSUS. It is axiomatic that significanceand effect must be given to every word of the tariff schedules. <T3>Carey andamp; Skinner, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, 42 CCPA 86, C.A.D. 576 (1954).In summary, the Customs Service is seeking comments on the proposal toclassify color television picture tubes as a separate tariff entity, eventhough they may be entered with a similar number of compatible televisionchassis, thereby changing a practice of classifying such merchandise asan unfinished, unassembled television receiver, in item 684.96, TSUS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority </ITAG>Because the proposed change could increase duties assessed on the merchandiseand could, because of the issues involved, be of significant interest toboth importers and the domestic industry, the Customs Service is givingthe notice and opportunity to comment as provided by section 315(d), TariffAct of 1930, as amended, and andSection; 177.10(c)(10), Customs Regulations(19 CFR 177.10(c)(1)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>The Customs Service will consider any timely written comments.
