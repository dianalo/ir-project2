Traders said there was no major industry-specific news driving the buying of some of the OTC market's largest technology issues. The stocks, which have been weak in recent weeks, just seemed cheap to investors, the traders said.    The buying supported the Nasdaq OTC Composite Index, which ended up a scant 0.03 to 458.36. The composite tumbled as low as 456.49 in intraday trading.    Volume remained tepid, with only 119 million shares changing hands. Advancing issues trailed decliners, 857 to 1,077.    Microsoft, the market's fourth-largest stock in terms of market capitalization, or price times shares outstanding, was among the biggest gainers in the technology group, adding 2 1/4 to 58 3/8 on 450,000 shares. A company spokesman said there was no news to account for the gain.    One trader said that as computer and software stock prices began to firm during yesterday's trading, short sellers of Microsoft were forced to buy shares to cover their positions. Short sellers expect a stock's price to fall and attempt to profit by borrowing shares to sell immediately. The investors hope to replace the borrowed shares later with stock bought at a lower price. If prices begin to rise instead, the short sellers often buy shares to &quot;cover&quot; their positions.    The activity in technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq Industrial Index 0.69 to 444.53, making it the market's strongest sector. The Nasdaq 100 Index of the biggest nonfinancial issues was up 2.40 to 430.77. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Financial Index lost 1.79 to 456.97.    Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody, said that if the bond market improves today, the late buying that pushed OTC share prices up from their lows could drive the Nasdaq composite higher.    &quot;If we get a little bit of a rally in the bond market, the rally we had {yesterday} could broaden,&quot; Mr. Zipper said. Technology stocks dominated the OTC market's most-active list. Apple Computer added 5/8 to 42 7/8 on slightly more than one million shares. The company said it was awarded a five-year contract valued at more than $164 million by a Honeywell unit to supply personal computers to the military.    Other technology stocks that gained included Sun Microsystems, which rose 1/2 to 15 1/4 on one million shares. Lotus Development added 1 to 26 1/4, and Intel advanced 1/2 to 29 1/4 on more than two million shares.    Oracle Systems gained 3/8 to 18 on 711,200 shares. Lyphomed topped Nasdaq's most-active list, ending unchanged at 30 1/4 on volume of 2.2 million shares. The stock has been active since Japan's Fujisawa Pharmaceutical offered on Monday $31 a share for those Lyphomed shares it doesn't already own.    MCI Communications was second on the most active list, with two million shares changing hands. The stock gained 1/8 to 37. Standard andamp; Poor's gave the company's commercial paper an A2 rating and made positive remarks about MCI's prospects.    A proposal to acquire HCC Industries for $8.50 a share drove the company's stock up 1 3/4 to 8 on 67,000 shares. The proposal comes from a group that includes current HCC shareholders and certain members of senior management. Shareholders cooperating with the group hold a total of about 48.8% of HCC's shares.    Colorocs gained 7/8 to 6 7/8. This newspaper said that Colorocs hopes to win a larger share of the U.S. color-copier market from leader Canon, with a smaller, cheaper and faster machine.    Success of the Colorocs copier could help the company become profitable in the fourth quarter, after years of losses, one analyst said. The American depositary receipts of Canon, a Japanese concern, slipped 3/4 to 64 1/8.    Pop Radio gained 2 to 24 on 106,200 shares. The company said it expects to report pretax profit for its fiscal year ended June 30 of about $1.3 million, its first profitable year since going public in 1985. In fiscal 1988, the company reported a loss of $2.7 million.    HDR Power Systems dropped 1 1/8 to 4 5/8 after announcing that it expects both earnings and sales for the fiscal first quarter ending Oct. 1 to be lower than year-earlier net income of $290,871, or 15 cents a share, on sales of about $2.9 million. Separately, the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of 22 cents a share, compared with 15 cents a share a year earlier.    Jiffy Lube International slipped 1/8 to 2 3/8 on 248,000 shares. The company reported a loss for its first quarter ended June 30 of $5.3 million, compared with a loss of $211,000 a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
