(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A paraplegic who hauledhimself up 3,200-foot El Capitan 6 inches at a time over nine days,using only his powerful arms, reached the summit of the challengingcliff Wednesday.   Mark Wellman was greeted by fellow park rangers with a T-shirtreading ``See you at the top.''   ``I'm tired,'' he said in a radio conversation with supportersat the base of the cliff. ``I have pains where I didn't even know Ihad parts.''   ``It's great, it's fantastic,'' he said. ``It was a reallygreat, beautiful climb and a really wonderful experience.''   He had some advice for others who are physically handicapped:``Go out and do it! If you feel you can do it, just go out and doit.''   Wellman, 29, and friend Mike Corbett started the day about 300feet from the top of the granite cliff, after spending the nighttied into sleeping bags on Chickenhead Ledge. Wellman covered about125 feet in the first two hours and just before noon cut loose hisextra gear for the final push to the top.   At 1:50 p.m. PDT, they reached the summit.   ``No one in my situation has ever done anything like this, andthat I'm proud of,'' Wellman, 29, said at a news conference atopthe rock, attended by some 55 reporters, friends and park rangerswho climbed an easy trail. ``I felt like the whole world waswatching.''   Wellman and Corbett later came down the mountain along a trailand arrived at the Valley floor at 8:45 p.m. Wellman rode down on ahorse. They planned to go out to dinner.   Corbett, who carried Wellman the final yards where the peakleveled out, called his friend ``a great companion, so solid, nevercomplaining, always going for it.''   At the top, Corbett gave his friend a signed photograph ofYosemite, on which he wrote: ``It was an unbelieveableexperience.'' The pair sipped champagne, gulped ice water andCorbett had a cigarette; he had smoked a pack a day during theclimb and had run out.   The climbers were a day behind schedule. They began the gruelingeffort July 18, and had been battling gusting wind and 90-degreeheat.   ``You have a dream and you know the only way that dream is goingto happen is if you just do it ... even if it's 6 inches at atime,'' Wellman told reporters before beginning the climb.   Wellman, whose legs have been paralyzed since a 1982 fall fromanother Yosemite peak, became the first paraplegic to make thevertical trek, doing 7,000 pullups on ropes placed by Corbett.   The two had said they were really sore and had been pushing tofinish the climb as early as possible.   Awaiting them on top was a sloping granite summit with a stark,windswept landscape considered one of the most beautiful spots inthe world. A dazzling view includes some of the towering peaks ofthe Sierra Nevada and Half Dome, another of the park's most famousfeatures.   Near the ledge they climbed over is a lone, contorted ancientpine that has greeted thousands of climbers since the face wasfirst scaled in 1958.   Wellman's companion, Corbett, 35, had previously scaled ElCapitan 41 times, more than any other climber. He will be reunitedwith his estranged family this weekend because of publicity overthe climb.   His brother and several others were flying in from Houston tomeet him, and the anticipation has distracted him from the climbingroutine. He said he couldn't sleep Monday.   ``I've got to fill my family in on a lot of things that havehappened in the last 10 years of my life,'' Corbett said by radioto Gwen Schneider, his girlfriend.   Schneider said Corbett last talked to his family in 1981 after a``really traumatic'' divorce by his parents.   The two climbed as far as they could each day since the weekendin hopes of making up a day and a half lost when the climb slowedto a vertical crawl.   Their biggest problem was wind, which Wellman said gusted from11 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day, sometimes blowing them 10 feet out fromthe cliff face.   The heat was less of a problem, but temperatures occasionallytopped 100 degrees on the face of the cliff.   Wellman chose a route that is almost straight up because it wasmore practical for him.   The route included tackling the Shield Roof, a ledge jutting 40feet out from the monolith at 2,000 feet above Yosemite Valley. Thetwo had to dangle beneath it and hoist themselves up a rope withvalley floor far below them.   Wellman was paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 feetduring a climb of 13,700-foot Gables Peak south of Yosemite in1982. He was hospitalized for seven months, but has since been asactive as possible, staying in shape with sports like kayaking anddirecting the park's program for disabled visitors.   He trained daily for six months for the El Capitan climb, making35 practice climbs on other sheer rocks and training with weights.</TEXT></DOC>
