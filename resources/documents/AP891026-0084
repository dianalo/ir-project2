STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A high-ranking Communist Party official met todaywith leaders of East Germany's largest pro-democracy group anddiscussed reform efforts, the latest government gesture to thegrowing protest movement.   It was the first time a member of the ruling Communist PartyPolitburo had met with opponents of the East German politicalsystem. The activists later called the talks an encouraging steptoward reform.   Earlier today, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called newEast German leader Egon Krenz to talk about ways to improverelations.   East Berlin Communist Party chief and Politburo member GuenterSchabowski met for two hours with Jens Reich, an East Berlinbiology professor and founding member of the pro-reform group NewForum. Another New Forum founder, Sebastian Pflugbeil, alsoattended the meeting.   ``We presented New Forum's concepts and ideas,'' Reich toldreporters after the meeting at the party Central Committeebuilding. The talks were ``open and constructive.''   Asked why they were invited to meet with Schabowski, Reich said:``He told us he wanted to begin a new political course and wantedto learn about the whole political spectrum here.''   Reich said Schabowski assured him the government's newfoundinterest in dialogue to solve the nation's problems ``was a realchange and not a tactical move.'' Schabowski also said thegovernment would consider changes in election procedures.   The government in the past has refused to deal with oppositionactivists, ignoring or persecuting them. Activists have campaignedfor a more democratic electoral system and the right to travel tothe West.   Asked if he believed a genuine dialogue could develop betweenpro-democracy groups and the government, Reich said: ``We will see.I can say cautiously that I have a positive impression.''   Schabowski told West Germany television on Wednesday, ``We areready for a dialogue with all levels of society.''   Communist authorities banned New Forum in September, but it hasbeen tolerated since then. Schabowski was asked about officialrecognition of the opposition group, but he said it was ``out ofhis capacity,'' Reich said.   Krenz on Wednesday hinted that opposition groups could beincluded in talks about possible reform, but reiterated that thenation's communist system is not a matter for debate.   Hans Klein, Kohl's spokesman, said Kohl and Krenz talked for 20minutes ``in a businesslike and constructive atmosphere.'' It wasthe first contact between the leaders since Krenz replaced ErichHonecker last week as the government struggled with ways to quellgrowing public unrest.   Krenz, although considered an orthodox socialist like Honecker,has been trying to keep an unruly citizenry in check by offering toopen dialogue with groups advocating economic and social reform.   Krenz made clear that East Germany will remain a socialiststate, though reforms will be considered, and reiterated a call onBonn to recognize East German citizenship, the East Germanstate-run news agency ADN reported.   West Germany gives immediate citizenship to any immigrant ofGerman origin, which has played a role in the flight of more than60,000 East Germans to the West over the past few months.   East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack called today for a town halldebate on reform, another sign of the government's recentwillingness to consider public views. The Communist Party'sBerliner Zeitung newspaper said the meeting would be held Sundayunder the motto, ``Open doors, open words.''   Pro-democracy protests continued Wednesday in various parts ofthe country. Thousands marched in the cities of Neubrandenburg andJena and about 2,000 people joined in a church vigil on EastBerlin's Alexanderplatz, ADN reported.   ADN said 20,000 people joined in what it called a ``march ofhope'' in Neubrandenburg, north of Berlin.   The marchers called for a dialogue with authorities and thecity's mayor, Heinz Hahn, promised talks with citizens, ADN said.   In Jena, 5,000 people marched peacefully to the city hall anddelivered a petition to Mayor Hans Spahn, ADN said. No details ofthe petition were given, but ADN said Spahn urged the crowd torefrain from further demonstrations and promised that the city hallwas ``open to every citizen.''   Opposition activists are demanding free elections and speech andmany say they do not object to socialism as long as it is trulydemocratic.   Krenz has promised new laws shortly that would give East Germansgreater freedom to travel, but made clear the Berlin Wall will notcome down.   Strict curbs on foreign travel have been a prime source ofcomplaint by East Germans. Tens of thousands of young, skilledworkers disillusioned with their homeland have fled to West Germanyin recent months.</TEXT></DOC>
