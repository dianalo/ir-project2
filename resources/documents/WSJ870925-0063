HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMT F FINBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America common shares plunged 21% on heavy volume yesterday, apparently because of rumors that the company may soon be acquired on terms that would severely dilute the interests of current shareholders.    Common shares of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp., parent of the nation's largest thrift, closed at a new low of $2.375, down 62.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume exceeded 1.2 million shares, and the stock traded as low as $1.75 a share. Options to buy Financial Corp. shares fell 33%.    Stock traders said there were persistent rumors that Ford Motor Co. would present an acquisition plan to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board today and that the Bank Board would meet with officials of Financial Corp. next week.    However, Anthony M. Frank, chairman of Ford's First Nationwide Bank unit, said he is scheduled to meet with Bank Board member Roger Martin on Wednesday, not today. Mr. Frank also said that William J. Popejoy, Financial Corp.'s chairman, will be present at the request of Mr. Martin.    Mr. Martin confirmed that the meeting has been scheduled, but said he would be only &quot;an observer&quot; of discussions between Messrs. Frank and Popejoy.    In an interview, Mr. Martin re-emphasized that he prefers a break-up plan being devised by Financial Corp. over the proposed acquisition by Ford. &quot;In the final analysis, the company will be broken up,&quot; Mr. Martin said. The plan calls for separating certain troubled loans and real estate from Financial Corp.'s main unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association, and selling the company's potentially large tax benefits.    Although Mr. Popejoy and others have said that there are major obstacles to completing the break-up plan, Mr. Martin repeated his view that the plan would be less costly for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. than an acquisition by Ford. Ford officials contend that their plan would cost the FSLIC about $1.4 billion if interest rates remain stable, while Mr. Martin contends it would cost $3 billion to $4.5 billion.    &quot;We're interested in (the break-up plan) because maybe there's a way to come out with just a clean savings and loan,&quot; Mr. Martin said.    After Financial Corp.'s shares began plunging, the company issued a statement that there were &quot;no new corporate developments&quot; to cause its stock price to drop. Financial Corp. added that members of its management and its financial advisers are to meet early next week with Bank Board officials &quot;to discuss FCA's future.&quot;    Traders said pressure to sell Financial Corp. shares developed suddenly yesterday. &quot;The stock had been reasonably dormant over the past couple months at about $3 a share,&quot; said one trader who asked not to be identified. &quot;All of a sudden today, the world came up for sale. There were no bids around until late in the day.&quot;    Options to buy Financial Corp. common at $5 a share in December closed yesterday at 12.5 cents, down 6.3 cents. Trading volume in the options totaled 720 contracts yesterday, compared with a normally thin daily volume of about 100 contracts, traders said. Each contract covers the purchase of 100 shares.    Mr. Frank this week confirmed publicly that First Nationwide wants to acquire Financial Corp. under terms that would require at least $1 billion in assistance from the FSLIC and a capital infusion of about $1 billion from Ford. Mr. Frank didn't indicate how Financial Corp. shareholders would be treated, but thrift-industry executives said an earlier Ford plan would have wiped out or severely diluted the interests of current Financial Corp. shareholders.    Mr. Popejoy said that he and other Financial Corp. officials expect to present a plan to the Bank Board Tuesday.    Mr. Popejoy yesterday took the unusual step of sending a Mailgram to top California thrift executives in which he tried to allay fears that Financial Corp. will drain the FSLIC's funds. He wrote that some executives &quot;have indicated to me their displeasure at the prospect of FCA using up a great deal of FSLIC's funds. I want you to know we have never sought and do not seek a FSLIC bailout.&quot; However, he added, &quot;it may be in the best interests of the Sandamp;L industry for FSLIC to facilitate a merger of FCA.&quot; He noted that such a decision &quot;will be in the hands&quot; of the Bank Board.    Mr. Popejoy outlined improvements at Financial Corp., but concluded, &quot;There is much work to be done. We are undercapitalized, have a large amount of non- to low-earning assets and still are exposed to interest-rate fluctuations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
