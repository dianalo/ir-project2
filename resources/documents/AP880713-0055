Lloyd Bentsen offers amixed record on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid anddefense spending could turn some female voters away from theDemocratic ticket in November.   ``Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' Molly Yard,president of the National Organization for Women, said after theTexas senator was announced as Michael Dukakis running mate choiceTuesday.   ``I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he isvery much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the moneyspent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why thevoters want change,'' she said.   Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women's PoliticalCaucus, said women's groups had not expected this year thatDemocrats would name a woman vice president candidate because ``thesense was that the Democratic Party felt they had already done awomen on the ticket.''   Geraldine Ferraro, who was Walter Mondale's running mate on thelosing Democratic ticket in 1984, said she was ``delighted'' by thechoice of Bentsen.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Democrats Release Proposed Platform As Jackson Continues</HEAD><TEXT>   Negotiations</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Aides to Jesse Jackson say they are stillnegotiating over minority planks in the Democratic Party platform,but expect to bring some issues to the floor of next week'sDemocratic National Convention.   The Democratic Platform Committee released a 4,700-word proposedplatform Tuesday without the minority planks the Jackson campaignhas been pushing.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jesse Jackson's chief platformnegotiator, said, ``Our minority reports are not in there becausewe're still negotiating.''   Jackson has said he may press floor fights in Atlanta nextTuesday on a dozen or more issues, including his call for highertaxes on the wealthy, a Pentagon freeze, more spending on educationand Head Start, no-first-use of nuclear weapons and Palestinianself-determination.   With 1,135 delegates, Jackson can force debates on any issue,but Dukakis's majority of 2,426 is large enough to leave no doubtas to who will win the fights.   The proposed platform avoids any mention of tax increases anddoes not say how Dukakis and the Democrats would deal with the hugefederal deficits.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Mayor Says New Orleans Will Be Ready For GOP _ Even If Police</HEAD><TEXT>   Strike</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mayor of New Orleans says a work stoppageof the sort staged this week by city police won't disrupt securityfor next month's Republican National Convention.   ``We have an alternative plan to deal with any problem,'' MayorSidney Barthelemy said Tuesday at a news conference called inresponse to Monday's 24-hour sick-out by almost one-fourth of the1,350-member police force.
