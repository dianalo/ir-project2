Seasonal pore water sulfate {delta}{sup 34}S measurementsyielded a calculated sulfate input of 0.6 per thousand. Sulfate transportedinto the sediments via diffusion appeared to be enriched in the lighterisotope because its concentration gradient was steeper, due to the increasein the measured isotopic composition of sulfate with depth. Similarly,the back diffusion of dissolved sulfide towards the sediment-water interfaceappeared enriched in the heavier isotope. The isotopic composition ofthis flux was calculated from measurements of the {delta}{sup 34}S ofdissolved sulfide and was determined to be 15.9 per thousand. The isotopiccomposition of buried sulfide was determined to be -5.2 per thousandand the detrital sulfur input was estimated to be -6.2 per thousand.An isotope mass balance equation based upon the fluxes at the sediment-waterinterface successfully predicted the isotopic composition of the buriedsulfur flux within 0.5 per thousand, thus confirming that isotopes diffusein response to their individual concentration gradients.</TEXT></DOC>
