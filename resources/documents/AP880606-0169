The Pentagon, in a series of announcements, also notifiedCongress of additional arms sale plans involving South Korea, Greeceand Turkey. Those deals will total about $200 million.   Assuming congressional approval, Japan will be allowed to buy thecomplete package of radars, vertical launching systems for missiles,satellite positioning gear and Phalanx anti-missile guns needed tobuild its own Aegis air-defense ship, the Pentagon said.   ``Installation of Aegis on a ship of the Japanese MaritimeSelf-Defense Force will enhance Japanese capability to protect itssea lines of communication,'' the Pentagon said.   ``It is in U.S. national interests to assist Japan in meetingthese goals.''   The proposed sale of the Aegis Combat System generated oppositionin the House earlier this year, with a small group of lawmakerscomplaining about Japan's trade policies and expressing concern thatJapan might not keep the technology secret.   That opposition has evaporated in recent weeks, however, and thedeal is now expected to win congressional blessing. DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci and other top Pentagon officials haveargued that theUnited States should not withhold advanced militarytechnology at a time when it is pressing Japan and other allies tospend more on defense.   The Aegis combat system was developed by the United States forits newest line of cruisers, the so-called Ticonderoga class, but italso is to be used on its next line of destroyers.   Japan intends to fit the combat system to a destroyer.   The Ticonderoga-class cruisers are considered the mostsophisticated air-defense ships in the world, featuring a uniquewrap-around radar system that allows the vessel to ``see'' in alldirections at once. The vessels also carry a large computer systemthat allows the simultaneous tracking of hundreds of targets whilecontrolling defensive missiles and other weapons.   The Pentagon said the prime contractor for the Aegis sale wouldbe the RCA Corp.'s Electronic Systems Division in Moorestown, N.J.,and that the Navy would oversee the transaction.   ``Implementation of this sale will require the assignment of 44U.S. contractor representatives to Japan for approximately threeyears,'' the Pentagon added.   The other arms transactions, meantime, involve the sale ofHarpoon anti-ship missiles to South Korea; spare parts and trainingservices to Greece to help support three F-4 Phantom jet fightersquadrons; and components and subassemblies for 15 UH-1H Hueytransport helicopters that will be assembled in Turkey.   The Pentagon said the deal with South Korea would involve 52 ofthe missiles and be worth an estimated $78 million. The deal withGreece will be worth an estimated $87 million, and the deal withTurkey an estimated $35 million.</TEXT></DOC>
