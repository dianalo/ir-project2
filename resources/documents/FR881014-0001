The Recommendation urges that preliminarychallenges generally should be heard by the court that will ultimatelyreview final agency action, but it further suggests the need for specialhandling by reviewing courts of challenges alleging unlawful delay by anagency.Recommendation 88-7, Valuation of Human Life in Regulatory Decisionmaking,calls on agencies to reveal publicly the processes through which they determinethe value of human life in making policy decisions. It also urges the Officeof Management and Budget to revise its guidance on use of a discount ratein the valuation of costs and benefits and to serve as the government'scentral clearinghouse for research and information on life valuation issues.Recommendation 88-8, Resolution of Claims Against Savings Receiverships,concerns the appropriate locus for adjudication of claims against failedsavings and loan institutions. The authority of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard (FHLBB) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)to adjudicate such claims, to the exclusion of federal courts, currentlyis the subject of litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court. The Recommendationtakes no position on the statutory and constitutional questions at issuein the litigation but, instead, urges Congress to examine the issues involvedand proposes procedures that should be followed if Congress determinesthat an administrative adjudication process is the more desirable approachto resolve such disputes.Recommendations of the Administrative Conference are published in fulltext in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> upon adoption.

In RecommendationNo. 75-3, ``The Choice of Forum for Judicial Review of Administrative Action''(1975), the Conference stated criteria for determining the appropriatejudicial forum for the review of final administrative action. The Recommendationurged that agency actions taken on the basis of a formal evidentiary recordshould normally be directly reviewable by courts of appeals, and that rulesand other informal orders issued by agencies whose formal orders are subjectto review in the courts of appeals should be reviewable by those same courts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Building upon the principles underlying that recommendation, the Conferencenow addresses the proper forum for judicial review where an agency hasissued no final order, but agency action (or inaction) is neverthelessconsidered reviewable by a court.\1\<NOTE/> For example, a party may allege that agency action has been``unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed'' within the meaning of 5U.S.C. 706. What level of court_trial or appellate_should have jurisdictionover such a preliminary challenge? Most direct review statutes do not specificallyaddress this question, and difficult jurisdictional questions have arisenas a result. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The Administrative Conference takes no position in thisrecommendation on whether and under what circumstances such preliminaryactions should be deemed judicially reviewable before issuance of a finalorder by an agency. <ITAG tagnum="21">The leading decision on this subject is <T3>Telecommunications Research and Action Center v. FCC</T3>, 750 F.2d70 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<T3>TRAC</T3>), a case involving a challenge to allegedly unreasonableagency delay. In <T3>TRAC</T3>, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit concluded that when the relevant statute assigns review of finalagency action (when and if it occurs) exclusively to the court of appeals,then a preliminary challenge also will be subject to exclusive appellatereview so long as relief in relation to it might affect the court's ultimatejurisdiction. Based on a court's authority to issue writs in aid of itsjurisdiction under the All Writs Act, <T3>TRAC</T3>'s holding strongly favors consolidating preliminary challengesin the courts of appeals even when the agency's organic statute does notsettle the point. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, some confusion has followed the <T3>TRAC </T3>decision. Subsequent opinions have grappled at length withthe question of what ``might affect'' the court's jurisdiction and, insome cases, have carved out exceptions to the <T3>TRAC </T3>doctrine. Some district courts, for example, have distinguishedcertain constitutional claims, for which they have upheld district courtjurisdiction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, some problems have remained because <T3>TRAC </T3>cannot readily be applied to situations in which the agency'sfinal action might take different forms, with different jurisdictionalconsequences. For example, in some cases the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration may decide to issue ``standards'', which are reviewablein the courts of appeals, or ``regulations'', which are reviewable in districtcourt. Jurisdictional uncertainty can also occur in preliminary challengesinvolving Food and Drug Administration approval of new drug applicationsunder the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. When the FDA refusesto approve an application, the statute authorizes the applicant to appealdirectly to the courts of appeals; this special review provision does notapply, however, to parties challenging FDA approval of a new drug application,who thus must proceed in district court. In cases like these, the <T3>TRAC </T3>rule may require courts to make premature jurisdictionalanalyses based on speculation about the nature of the action the agencymay ultimately take in order to determine whether they can hear the preliminarychallenge. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference believes that there is a need for greater clarity inthis area. Unless Congress has reason to believe otherwise in a specificstatute, jurisdiction over all such preliminary challenges should followthe principle of <T3>TRAC.</T3> The requirement that preliminary challenges be heard exclusivelyby the court that will ultimately review final agency action may influencea litigator's decision whether to raise an issue preliminarily and thusdiscourage the bringing of preliminary review proceedings that have littlemerit but offer some potential for creating delay. In addition, the courtsthat review final agency action may be more familiar with the substantiveprograms adminstered by an agency, and thus better able to evaluate theissues raised in preliminary challenges. To avoid further confusion overproper jurisdiction, the <T3>TRAC </T3>rule should be interpreted to include all cases in whichfinal action would be reviewable in the courts of appeals, and the exceptionsthat have been carved out by the district courts should be rejected. Wherejurisdiction over the final action is unclear, however, preliminary challengesshould be cognizable in either the district courts or the courts of appeals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some special consideration may be necessary where preliminary challengesinvolve allegedly unlawful delay by an agency. For these challenges, bydefinition, time is generally of the essence; moreover, they usually donot require elaborate analysis of the relevant facts or applicable law.Frequently these claims may be resolved more easily and expeditiously throughthe use of simpler or less formal approaches than through the ordinarycourse of briefing and oral argument. The courts of appeals should developtechniques for dealing with these cases promplty and practically when theyarise. While the most effective measures may vary depending upon the proceduralrules applicable in individual courts, possible approaches might includerules permitting, in appropriate cases, decision on the briefs withoutoral argument, the filing of petitioners' briefs simultaneously with thenotice of appeal, expedited calendaring of delay cases, informal statusor settlement conferences involving a single judge, and, where the recordmay require expansion through factfinding, prompt assignment to a districtcourt, magistrate, or other official for that purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, the Conference offers the following recommendation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>1. In considering legislation that would assign jurisdiction to reviewagency action to either district courts or courts of appeals, Congressshould:(a) Follow the principles stated in ACUS Recommendation 75-3, <T3>The Choice of Forum for Judicial Review of Agency Action; </T3>and(b) Take special care to consider where preliminary challenges to agencydecisionmaking should be brought, specifying whether the district courtsor the courts of appeals or both have jurisdiction over such challenges.As a general rule, jurisdiction over reviewable preliminary challengesshould be assigned to the forum that would have jurisdiction if an appealwere taken from final agency action growing out of the proceeding.(c) Provide that when the proper forum for judicial review of final agencyaction may be either the district courts or the courts of appeals, dependingupon matters such as the form the agency's action will eventually takeor the outcome of the proceeding, any of the courts that might have jurisdictionover final agency action should have jurisdiction over reviewable challengesto the agency's preliminary action (or inaction).2. In the absence of Congressional direction, the principles identifiedin paragraph 1 (b) and (c) of this recommendation should govern the choiceof forum for otherwise reviewable preliminary challenges to agency action.3. Where jurisdiction over claims involving unlawful delay by an agencylies in the courts of appeals, those courts should assure that their proceduresprovide adequately for prompt and efficient disposition of such claims.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.88-7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Valuation of Human Life in Regulatory Decisionmaking (RecommendationNo. 88-7).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Regulations intended to lessen risks of accidents and illness ordinarilyimpose compliance costs on regulated entities and on rulemaking agencies.In return, society gains numerous benefits, most notably the avoidanceof fatalities, injuries and disease, and in some instances a reductionin property damage. Promulgation of such regulations is a multi-facetedprocess, and this recommendation addresses one set of issues frequentlyencountered in agency decisionmaking_the valuation of human life.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Agencies often make reasoned estimates of the reduction in fatalitieslikely to follow implementation of a particular regulation, or of alternativeregulations. It is rarely if ever possible to eliminate risk altogether,and it is nearly always the case that greater risk reduction raises compliancecosts. Faced with such situations, agencies cannot avoid placing a value_eitherexplicitly or implicitly_on the societal benefits of risk reduction. Althoughsimilar issues are obviously involved when agencies seek to evaluate thebenefit of avoiding illnesses or injuries, this recommendation is limitedto agency practices and constraints in benefits valuation when the benefitat issue is future lives saved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Placement of a dollar value on human life is controversial and complex,and a wide array of approaches may be employed. A broad range of dollarvalues per life saved can be observed in regulatory outcomes across programsand departments. In part, this reflects differing views about what explicitvalue is suitable for a given type of hazard, and in part it reflects judgmentsthat, for reasons of policy or legal constraints, decisions should takeno account of the value of life implict in those decisions. Some agenciesreject all explicit efforts to place a monetary value on human life, whileothers routinely build such estimates into their regulatory proposals.This diversity can be sharp even within the same department. Those agenciesthat are willing to utilize explicit normative benchmarks for the valueof life appear to be moving toward reliance on the same basic estimationtechnique, generally referred to as ``willingness-to-pay.'' This techniqueis premised on the assumption that by examination of marketplace behavior,one can roughly ascertain how much individuals would be willing to payin order to reduce the probability of death from a particular hazard orcause, or how much they would require in the form of salary increases orother payments to be willing to accept the increased probability. Whilewillingness-to-pay provides the most inclusive analysis currently availablefor evaluating the benefits derived from regulatory reduction of fatalities,it falls far short of an ideal process and can produce results that aremisleading because the analysis often fails to take into account all relevantvariables.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference recognizes the rudimentary state of knowledge on thisissue, and realizes that both methodologies and results are likely to continueto vary among agencies. In this environment, however, it would be usefulfor agencies to take measures that would reveal publicly the processesthrough which they have determined the valuation of life incorporated inpolicy decisions.\1\<NOTE/> Such a procedure would provide useful clarification and expositionof the unavoidable trade-offs in regulating hazards, and would also assistin drawing attention to those hazards where further protection may be feasibleat acceptable cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In 1979, the Conference made a similar recommendationabout cost-benefit analyses, Recommendation 79-4, <T3>Public Disclosure Concerning the Use of Cost-Benefit and Similar Analysesin Regulation, </T3>1 C.R.F. andSection; 305.79-4 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="21">In this way, agency practice may also be measured against developmentsin the valuation techniques and evaluated for consistency with other agenciesas well as with other regulations in the same agency. The Office of Managementand Budget (OMB), in its oversight of executive branch regulatory activities,could facilitate consistency by providing a central clearinghouse for researchand information on life valuation issues. OMB should also assist agenciesby updating its guidance concerning discount rates used by agencies inderiving present value equivalents of future effects. The current government-widegeneral guidance on discounting is contained in OMB Circular A-94 whichhas not been updated since 1972.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation  </ITAG>1. When an agency adopts a regulation that is intended to reduce the riskto human life, based on a judgment that the associated compliance costsare justified, the agency should disclose the dollar value per statisticallife used for the purposes of that determination. Such statements and disclosuresshould also set forth the human life valuation implications of alternativelevels of regulatory stringency considered by the agency. Exceptions tothis principle may be appropriate where empirical information about eitherthe costs or benefits of the regulation is highly conjectural, or wherethe benefits include values which cannot be quantified in market terms,<T3>e.g.,</T3> aesthetic gains. In such cases, agencies should explainthe nature and degree of imprecision in the valuation process so that thepublic will not be misled. When an agency declines to adopt a regulationdue to these considerations, it should provide similar information.  2. In implementing paragraph 1, agencies that develop and use methodologiesfor placing a monetary value on human life should recognize that thereremain substantial limitations of current methodology to incorporate allthe variables that affect societal valuations of human life. An agencyshould explain the factors included or considered in its valuation. Theagency also should explain how it weighs such factors.  3. Whenever agencies choose to discount costs and benefits in implementingparagraph 1, they should clearly and fully disclose what rates they areusing, the methodology that generated those rates, and the sensitivityof outcomes to the particular rates applied. The Office of Management andBudget (OMB) should revise its guidance concerning the use of a discountrate in the valuation of costs and benefits to reflect recent learningon the subject, either through updating OMB Circular A-94 or by other means.Such guidance should articulate the various methods by which a discountrate can be derived and the scope of subjects to which it can be applied. 4. OMB should serve federal agencies as a central clearinghouse for researchand information on life valuation issues. To this end, OMB should continueand expand its discussion of agency practices in the life valuation area,initiated in the 1987-88 edition of the annual Regulatory Program of theUnited States Government.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;305.88-8  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Resolution of Claims Against Savings Receiverships (Recommendation88-8).  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When a federally insured savings and loan institution (``thrift'')fails, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) exercises overall regulatorycontrol. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), underthe direction of the FHLBB, ordinarily acts as receiver for federally insuredthrifts, and, in that capacity, must pay the valid credit obligations ofthe failed thrift. In the process of accepting, settling or rejecting adiverse and complex range of creditor claims, the FSLIC attempts to resolvedisputes informally. If this cannot be done, claimants may resort to anadjudicative process. The locus of this adjudication_agency or court_andits elements are the concerns of this recommendation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Exclusivity of the Agency Adjudication Process.</T3> The FHLBB andits sister agency, the FSLIC, have asserted exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicatecreditor claims against thrift receiverships. To establish and enforceits asserted power as receiver to adjudicate creditor claims, the FSLIChas adopted the practice of seeking to have claims litigation that hasbeen initiated in state courts removed to the federal courts, where theFSLIC then moves for dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction.The agency has sometimes moved to override court judgments granted to creditorsthat were entered before a thrift was place in receivership.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FSLIC's argument is that, as receiver, it has been vested withexclusive power to determine the validity of creditor claims, and thatthe jurisdiction of the courts to make independent determinations has beenprecluded. It is further argued by the FHLBB and FSLIC that their finaladministrative determinations are subject not to <T3>de novo</T3> judicial review, but only to the limited judicial reviewprovided under the Administrative Procedure Act. This agency position hasbecome known as the <T3>Hudspeth</T3> doctrine, after the Fifth Circuit decision in which itwas first accepted (<T3>North Mississippi Savings and Loan Association </T3>v.<T3> Hudspeth</T3>, 756 F.2d 1096 (5th Cir. 1985)). But other courts havedeclined to follow <T3>Hudspeth</T3>. See e.g., <T3>Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. </T3>v.<T3> CHG International, Inc.,</T3> 811 F.2d 1209 (9th Cir. 1987), holdingthat the FSLIC has no statutory authority to adjudicate claims to the exclusionof the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court has granted <T3>certiorari</T3> to resolve the differences. See <T3>Coit Independence Joint Venture </T3>v.<T3> FirstSouth, F.A,</T3> 829 F.2d 563 (5th Cir. 1987), <T3>cert. granted,</T3> 108 S. Ct. 1105 (1988).  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of the considerable adjudicatory power that the <T3>Hudspeth</T3> doctrine potentially grants to the FSLIC, the doctrinehas provoked controversy concerning the fairness, efficiency, and legaland constitutional validity of the administrative procedures. In fact,the position of the Solicitor General in its brief for the Government inthe <T3>Coit</T3> case does not endorse the FHLBB's argument that it is statutorilyempowered to ``adjudicate'' these claims. The Solicitor General maintainsthat, while Congress could have provided for administrative adjudicationin this context, it has simply (and appropriately) provided for a claimsreview step in the process that must be exhausted by claimants before theyseek judicial resolution of claims.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference takes no position on the statutory and constitutionalpower of the FHLBB to resolve these claims. Unless the Supreme Court findsadministrative adjudication in this context to be constitutionally impermissible,Congress should examine the need for agency adjudication of such claims,as an alternative to, or at least a required prelude to, <T3>de novo</T3> resolution of such claims in state and federal courts.For this reason, the Conference has examined the fairness and efficiencyof the current administrative procedure for determining creditor claimsagainst thrift receiverships.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Current Claims Procedures.</T3> Claims against failed thrifts are institutionallyand procedurally separated at the FSLIC. Those made by insured depositorson the one hand, and uninsured depositors and other creditors on the other,are handled by separate divisions within the FSLIC. Although many claimsare resolved at the division level (so-called ``receiver's determinations''),rejected claimants may seek administrative review by the Adjudication Divisionof the FHLBB's Office of General Counsel, with final administrative reviewby the Board itself in complex cases. Though the case law is unsettled,<T3>de novo</T3> judicial review has been allowed in the case of insureddepositor claims and, under the <T3>Hudspeth</T3> decision, limited judicial review under the AdministrativeProcedure Act was contemplated in the case of non-insured and general creditorclaims.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Need for Congressional Attention.</T3> As thrift receiverships proliferate,the Conference urges Congress to consider whether it is more appropriatefor disputes over claims filed against such receiverships to be decidedby the FHLBB, or whether it is better to leave them to <T3>de novo</T3> resolution in state and federal courts_with or withouta prior administrative claims review step at the FHLBB.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If Congress does determine that an administrative adjudication process(coupled with appropriate judicial review) is the preferable approach,it should clarify the FHLBB's statutory authority. It should provide foran adjudicative system that makes clear that claimants have an opportunityto have their claims heard by adjudicators who are completely independentof other offices of the FHLBB or FSLIC, which may be perceived to havea financial interest in the outcome of such claims. To that end, a bifurcatedhearing process should be established, offering claimants who can demonstratethat an issue of material fact is genuinely presented an opportunity foran on-the-record APA hearing presided over by an administrative law judge.An alternative, simplified procedure should be authorized for other casesor where parties agree to use it.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FHLBB's current program of adjudicating claims against receivershipsrequires two additional improvements. First, final rules of practice needto be issued,\1\<NOTE/> and time limits should be established. Second, the agencyshould refrain from attempting to override prereceivership judgments enteredin federal or state courts.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\On November 8, 1985 the FHLBB published proposed rulesgoverning its claims adjudication process (see 50 Fed. Reg. 48970). OnApril 21, 1988 the FHLBB published interim procedures pending the adoptionof final regulations, giving notice that the interim procedures that havebeen in effect in practice since July 1, 1986 will remain in effect pendingthe adoption of final regulations. See 53 Fed. Reg. 13105.<ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation    </ITAG>1. Congress should determine whether disputes over claims filed againstthrift receiverships are better decided by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board(FHLBB) in an administrative adjudication process (coupled with judicialreview) or by the judiciary through <T3>de novo</T3> resolution in state or federal courts (with or withouta prior administrative claims review step at the FHLBB).\2\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Conference, at this time, does not intend to expressan opinion on which of these alternatives is preferable.    2. If Congress does determine that an administrative adjudication processis the more desirable approach, it should clarify the FHLBB's statutoryauthority by providing for an FHLBB adjudicative process along the linesset forth below:    (a) A bifurcated process should be established for adjudicating claimantappeals from determinations of thrift receivers. Where the claimant affirmativelydemonstrates that an issue of material fact is genuinely presented, theFHLBB should offer an opportunity for an on-the-record APA hearing, presidedover by an administrative law judge. In all other cases, or where the partiesvoluntarily agree, the FHLBB should be authorized to use simplified, lessformal procedures, presided over by persons who need not be ALJs but whoshould be institutionally separate from the receiver.\3\<NOTE/> All parties, including receivers, should be encouraged toengage in alternative means of dispute resolution.\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See ACUS Statement, ``Dispute Resolution Procedure inReparations and Similar Cases'', 1 CFR 310.13 (1988).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See ACUS Recommendation 86-3, ``Agencies' Use of AlternativeMeans of Dispute Resolution'', 1 CFR 305.86-3 (1988).    (b) Final FHLBB decision on such claims should be based on the administrativerecord and subject to direct judicial review in accordance with the principlesstated in ACUS Recommendation 75-3 (``The Choice of Forum for JudicialReview of Administrative Action'').    3. The FHLBB should publish, after a notice-and-comment rulemaking procedure,final rules setting forth its rules of practice for claims determinations.The rules should provide for strict, albeit reasonable, time limits \5\<NOTE/> applicable not only to claimants but also to receivers andtheir agents.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See ACUS Recommendation 78-3, ``Time Limits on AgencyAction,'' 1 CFR 305.78-3 (1988).    4. The FHLBB (and FSLIC as receiver) should not override prereceivershipjudgments entered in federal and state courts. The agenies' power to adjudicateclaims should not encompass judgments in favor of creditors that have beenentered by a court of competent jurisdiction before the thrift was placedin receivership. The FSLIC as receiver should either acquiesce in thesejudgments or pursue post-trial remedies.    5. Congress should include in any legislation responsive to this recommendationa requirement that the FHLBB adopt appropriate regulations and policiesas set out in paragraphs 3 and 4.  <ITAG tagnum="81">4. </ITAG><T3>Correction.    </T3>In FR Doc. 88-15458 beginning on page 26025 in the issue of Monday, July11, 1988 (regarding Indemnification of Government Contractors) make thefollowing corrections:  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.88-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Corrected]    </ITAG>On page 26027, in the third column, in footnote *, replace ``56 U.S.L.W.4792 (U.S. June 27, 1988)'' with ``108 S.
