Results to date ofthis and other programs have provided a much better understanding ofthe relationship between processing conditions and biological activity.These studies not only confirmed that several materials associated withthe SRC/TSL process are mutagenic, but also identified the classes ofchemical compounds most strongly associated with the mutagenicity andtheir distribution among the products. Furthermore, research uncovereda number of unexpected biological effects that could pose health risks.Should the process be commercialized, several changes might be warranted,particularly in the product slate to be marketed. The demonstration projectincluded a comprehensive program to protect the health and ensure thesafety of plant workers as well as that of the general public. Researchresults have confirmed the importance of this program and identifiedmodifications that might be considered for added protection.</TEXT></DOC>
