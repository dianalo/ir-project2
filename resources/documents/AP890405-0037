The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of savingsinstitutions, said Tuesday the national average for conventional,single-family loans jumped to 11.36 percent in early March, up from11.11 percent in early February.   It was the highest rate since early October 1987, when theaverage hit 11.42 percent just before the stock market crash.Interest rates began falling after the crash as the Federal ReserveBoard pumped money into the economy to guard against a recession.   The bank board said rates for the most popular type of one-yearadjustable-rate mortgages, those with caps on how high the rate canincrease, also rose last month to 9.75 percent, up from 9.6 percentin early February.   It was the highest ARM rate since March 1986, when the averagewas 9.84 percent, the bank board said.   The Fed for a year now has been tightening credit and pushinginterest rates upward in an effort to restrain economic growth tohold down inflation. Those efforts intensified in February afterthe government reported there were sharp price increases at boththe wholesale and retail levels during January.   ``The increases in the early March rates reflected the generaltightening in credit markets during February,'' said James Barth,chief economist for the bank board.   The percentage of mortgages closed with adjustable ratesdeclined to 55 percent in early March, down from 57 percent inFebruary, the board reported.   A separate weekly report released Friday by the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, showed interest ratesremained high throughout March.   It said fixed-rate home mortgages were averaging 11.19 percentlast week, down slightly from a rate of 11.22 percent during theprevious week. On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders wereasking an average initial rate of 9.31 percent last week, up from9.3 percent the previous week.   The Freddie Mac averages are lower than the bank board's becausethey do not include add-on fees, known as points, which are paid byborrowers.</TEXT></DOC>
