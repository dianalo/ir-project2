The regulations, which take effect immediately, require persons responsible for waste sites or cleanup efforts to provide for workers' training and medical surveillance and to give them protective equipment and information on safety procedures. The rules were mandated earlier this year when Congress amended the Superfund law.    Estimates of the cost of complying with the new standards are being calculated and won't be ready until the final rules are released, department officials said. The final rules are due by October.    Until the interim rules were disclosed, no mandatory safety rules applied specifically to the hazardous-waste industry, but there were guidelines on the handling of certain chemicals. The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration currently inspects about 100 hazardous-waste sites each year, and officials said they expect to review at least as many under the new rules.    Frank White, deputy assistant secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, stressed that the agency met the congressional deadline for issuing the regulations and added optional standards requiring decontamination procedures and emergency response plans.    The new rules apply to employees at sites the Environmental Protection Agency licenses and to emergency fire, police, ambulance and other workers who must respond to spills and rail or highway accidents. </TEXT></DOC>
