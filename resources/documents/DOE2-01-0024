This automatic method is basedon non subjective criterions related to the first and second derivativesof the density profile corresponding to a given vessel cross-section.The validity of the method has been tested on rigid PVC phantom vesselsfrom 2.7 to 8.6 mm in diameter filled with iodine contrast. A very highcorrelation between experimental VS. calculated diameters is demonstrated.Results are shown to be independent of the iodine concentration in therange of practical dilutions. A wider range of diameters has been exploredon glass tubes from 0.9 to 15.0 mm in diameter. The accuracy and reproductibilityof the method are estimated to be +/-2% and 4% respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
