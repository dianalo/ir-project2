BLACKLEDGE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Oral Roberts, who said in Marchhe needed $11 million by Saturday to save his ministry, will askcreditors for more time if the $4 million still needed isn't raisedthis weekend, ministry officials said.   Mark Swadener, chief financial officer for the ministry, saidofficials will meet Monday to determine whether the fund-raisinggoal was met and if they need to request more time from vendors.   Roberts said in late March that he must raise $11 million by May6 or creditors will begin ``dismantling'' Oral Roberts Universityand City of Faith hospital. The university also would be unable tomeet the payroll for its 2,130 employees, he said.   ``Based upon where we have been, it looks like we will have totalk to the vendors about an extension,'' Swadener said Thursday.   Roberts, 71, said monthly contributions to his ministry havebeen cut nearly in half, dropping from $5 million to $2.7 million,and blamed ``a spirit of skepticism'' after scandals in theministries of evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.   He said his ministry was in ``a life-or-death struggle'' to paythe six months of past-due bills.   Roberts announced Tuesday that the university's athleticprograms were dropping out of NCAA competition immediately to savean estimated $500,000 to $1 million a year.   The ministry also said Wednesday it was canceling a contract tobroadcast Richard Roberts' daily show on KOTV in Tulsa in hopes ofsaving $100,000 through the end of the year. Richard Roberts isOral Roberts' son.   The university will hold commencement excercises Saturday fornearly 1,000 of its 4,300 students.</TEXT></DOC>
