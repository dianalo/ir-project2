Trials will be conducted on about 100 patients over 18 months to two years, the medical products maker said. The laser method vaporizes deposits within the arteries, as opposed to the widely used balloon angioplasty technique, which compresses deposits.    If approved for general use, the laser system would allow doctors to operate on patients who wouldn't normally be candidates for bypass surgery because of extensive arterial blockage or because these patients' arteries are too thin.    Summit also said it was issued a patent by the Patent Office for a coupling device that guides the beam to the clogged mass, away from normal tissue. The patent provides the company protection on its fiber-optic system for angioplasty. Each unit is to sell for about $220,000, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
