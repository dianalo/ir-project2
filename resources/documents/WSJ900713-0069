Most of the change will come because InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. is beginning to flex its muscles asit starts to deliver the impressive line of workstations itannounced early this year. Market researchers expect IBM togo from essentially no market share in workstations to some15% to 20% of the market over the next year and a half. Andthat market share obviously must come out of somebody else'shide.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, Sun Microsystems Inc. has reasserteditself as the leader of the market for workstations, powerfulmachines used mainly by engineers. Hewlett-Packard Co. hasfaltered. Digital Equipment Corp. has improved its productline but confused its marketing message. Next Inc., SteveJobs' much-publicized new company, has failed to make anyimpact. And several Japanese companies are preparing to enterthe market with clones of Sun's systems.   &quot;This is sort of like the battle of Waterloo,&quot; saysCharles Foundyller, president of Daratech Inc., amarket-research firm that focuses on workstations. &quot;The Sunsand Digitals and HPs have fought themselves to a standstill,and now we hear drums in the distance. Sun is slowly winning,but now IBM is thundering on the scene with fresh troops andseemingly inexhaustible resources.&quot;   The market is important mainly because it is growing sofast: Gartner Group Inc., a market-research firm, estimatesthat the world-wide workstation market will nearly quadrupleto $19 billion in 1994 from $5 billion this year.   But it is also important because part of that growth maycome at the expense of personal computers and minicomputers.That is a matter of particular concern to companies such asIBM that sell a wide range of machines.   Workstations -- essentially very powerful personalcomputers with high-resolution monitors -- are starting tohead down into the traditional personal-computer price range.They are beginning to run similar software and eventually maybe sold through personal-computer dealers. Workstations arealso delivering so much computing power that, as softwarebecomes widely available over the next couple of years, theycould move out of their traditional preserve in engineeringdepartments and into the mainstream business applicationsthat minicomputers now handle.   IBM, having failed in two prior efforts to crack theworkstation market, seems to have finally gotten thingsright. The machines it began shipping in May are morepowerful than those of its major competitors and are pricedrather aggressively.   The major hurdle was expected to be getting softwaredevelopers to make enough application packages available, aproblem that has hobbled Digital Equipment. And there havebeen extensive reports in the trade press of bugs in IBM'soperating system, which would make application developmentdifficult. But software developers and consultants say thatthe bugs have been stamped out almost entirely and thatapplication software will be available on time. IBM says thatby the end of the year it plans to have 1,500 majorapplication software packages and 7,000 total applicationsavailable -- on a par with the numbers Sun can claim.   Bill Filip, a senior marketing executive in IBM'sworkstation operation, said orders have been at &quot;the high endof expectations.&quot; He pointed to an International Data Corp.study that predicted IBM would sell 15,000 units this yearand said the total would be &quot;substantially more than that.&quot;He said IBM has already decided to expand its productioncapacity. Until recently, someone ordering a machine would betold he might not get it until next May.   The biggest problem that IBM still faces is that itdoesn't have a low-end machine. Its line starts at $13,000for a stripped-down machine, while Sun, for instance, startsat around $5,000. IBM says it will correct that problem,though probably not for almost a year. IBM executives alsoindicated the machine's price might be $1,500 to $3,000higher than Sun's.   IBM also faces the standard problem in the workstationmarket: The machines' power doubles every 12 to 18 months, socompanies must run hard just to stand still.   Noting that other companies have announced fast machinessince the IBM announcement in February, Louise Rehling, asenior vice president at software developer SPSS Inc., saysthat IBM still has a lead in power, &quot;but it's gettingnarrower.&quot;   Vicki Brown, an analyst at International Data, says sheexpects IBM to be neck and neck with Digital Equipment forthe No. 2 spot by the end of next year -- with Sun still theleader and HP slipping to fourth.   HP has had problems partly for reasons beyond its control:It had announced products based on the Motorola Inc. 68040processor, but Motorola was more than nine months late inshipping those chips. HP also has had trouble integrating itsproduct lines with those of Apollo Computer Inc., which itacquired last year. Those problems are expected to keep adamper on HP's workstation sales for the next year or so,too.   Competitors and consultants say Digital Equipment hasstrengthened its product line considerably, overcoming someearlier problems. But they add that Digital's marketingmessage is muddled because it offers two types of machines:those that use its own operating systems and those that useUnix.   Workstations typically use the Unix operating system,which runs on hardware made by numerous companies, making iteasy to move Unix-based application software from onecompany's computers to another's. But Digital has made itsmark by selling systems that use its proprietary operatingsystems, which lock customers into buying Digital hardwarebecause their applications won't run on anyone else's boxes.   More than most old-line companies, Digital has been slowto make the move to Unix. Despite a growing Unix business,Digital's blunt president, Ken Olsen, has labeled some claimsabout the system &quot;snake oil&quot; and trashed its prospects atevery opportunity.   Sun has rebounded from some problems last year and seemsto be in the best position for the next year or so. It has astrong product line, including the new Sparcstations thatstart at $5,000. It also has a clean marketing message, giventhat it is only in the workstation market and doesn't haveany conflicting interests.   Sun faces a wild card over the next year and a halfbecause it has licensed others to make Sparcstation clonesand could face an influx of Japanese competitors. Sun,however, dismisses the potential for trouble. Chief ExecutiveScott McNealy agrees that IBM lost market share to companiesthat cloned its personal computers but says that IBMgenerates personal-computer revenue of maybe $13 billion ayear. &quot;Hurt me with that problem,&quot; Mr. McNealy says.   ---                  Workstation Market                                                                                                                   Market shares based on 1989 revenue                                                                                                               Sun Microsystems .................  30.4%        Digital Equipment ................  26.6        Hewlett-Packard ..................  26.1        Intergraph .......................   7.0        Silicon Graphics .................   5.1        International Business Machines ..   1.2                                                                                                          Source: International Data Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
