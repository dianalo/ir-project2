Mitchell and Dole made their statements after an unusual caucusof both parties, behind closed doors, on whether to accept the payraise the House approved 252-174 Thursday for itself and other topgovernment officials.   The leaders said the essential elements of the House packagewould remain in the Senate proposal, including the elimination ofspeech honoraria as a source of outside income for lawmakers.   The House voted to raise its pay, and that of governmentexecutive and federal judges, by more than 35 percent in less than14 months. House salaries would soar from the current $89,500 tomore than $120,000.   With the higher pay, House members would be barred beginning in1991 from pocketing honoraria checks for speeches before interestgroups. They also would be subject to other new rules in the firstmajor overhaul of its ethics rules in 12 years.   The House plan doesn't include a raise for the Senate unless theSenate votes to include itself. Dole and Mitchell did not saywhether their proposal would make it identical.   Enemies of the pay raise were trying to turn up the pressureagainst it. Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate who helped kill aproposed 51 percent pay raise just 10 months ago, called the newplan a ``legislative pay-grab wolf in a minor ethical reformsheep's clothing.''   The Senate could vote to give itself no raise but let the Houseand others get theirs. Or it could buy into the whole deal, kill itor choose something in between.   ``The leadership is pushing hard for us to adopt the Housepackage,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Thursday. ``Apparently,it must be a close vote.''   Mitchell has said he favored the House plan but speculated theSenate might go for a more modest pay package and a more gradualelimination of honoraria.   Senators now may keep speaking fees equal to 40 percent of theirsalaries, compared to 30 percent in the House, so the House planactually could be an income cut for some senators. The Senate alsohas its own ideas about ethics rules, including restrictions onlobbying after lawmakers leave office.   The House plan would raise salaries in a series of steps, for atotal minimum 35 percent raise by Jan. 1, 1991. On top of that,lawmakers and the other officials would get whatever cost-of-livingadjustment is given to rank-and-file government workers on thatdate.   President Bush, eager to raise pay for his top staff and thefederal judges, has already said he would sign the bill.   House members who took the politically unpopular plunge andvoted for the pay raise Thursday were watching the Senate's movescarefully, for fear the other chamber would kill it.   ``The Senate in the next 24 hours needs to think about what ispolitically possible,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., co-chairmanof the task force that drafted the House plan.   Another House Democrat said the pressure his chamber would puton the Senate would approach ``white heat.''   In a similar situation seven years ago, the Senate let the Housescoot ahead in salary. But senators reconsidered six months laterand gave themselves a catch-up raise.   Besides the ban on keeping honoraria, the House bill includes abroad range of changes in its rules and in federal ethics law.   Outside earnings besides honoraria would be limited to 15percent of salary and severely restricted in scope. Rules governingthe acceptance of gifts and travel from people outside theimmediate family would be tightened.   The rules also would require more detailed disclosure ofpersonal assets.   The most recent congressional pay raise was in 1987, and ithasn't been raised since then primarily because members fear thepolitical consequences.</TEXT></DOC>
