Levine and Robert M. Wilkis.    The plans, which were filed with the federal district court in New York, could spark a dispute between the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service.    A supporting memorandum filed by the SEC notes that the IRS has laid claim to $10.7 million of the $11.5 million from Mr. Levine. Under the SEC distribution plan, Mr. Levine's profits would be divided into two funds with about $4.9 million set aside to satisfy, on a pro-rata basis, the tax claims of the IRS and state and local governments. The remaining $6.6 million would be paid to investors in stocks in which Mr. Levine traded.    A spokesman for the IRS said the agency hasn't yet reviewed the plans, and doesn't know if it will contest them.    The portion of the Levine fund set aside for investors would also be distributed on a pro-rata basis, with a separate &quot;pool&quot; of profits to be created for each of the 57 securities in which Mr. Levine traded.    In 12 stocks, Mr. Levine's profits exceeded $100,000. The SEC said it and the court-appointed receiver, Sheldon Goldfarb, would try to identify all persons who traded in those stocks on the same day as Mr. Levine. It said broker-dealers would be asked to identify customers on whose behalf the trades were carried out.    But the agency said it wouldn't attempt to find the investors in the remaining 45 pools, where profits were smaller. It said the cost of finding those investors wouldn't justify doing so.    According to the plan, Mr. Levine profited most from trading in Nabisco Brands Inc. in May 1985. The profits available for distribution from his trades from May 6-8 and on May 15, 20 and 21 amount to $1.4 million, or about 21% of the funds set aside for distribution to investors.    These are the other 11 securities in which profits available for distribution total more than $100,000, along with the dates in which Mr. Levine traded in them:    --Sunbeam Corp., Sept. 11, 14, 15, 1981.    --Criton Corp., Aug. 17-19, 26, 1982.    --Itek Corp., Nov. 12, 15-19, 22, Dec. 13, 19, 1982.    --RCA Corp., (Dec. 30 call options) Sept. 20, 21, 1983.    --Jewel Cos., March 22, 23, 26, 30, April 4, 9, 10, May 31, 1984.    --Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., March 22, 26, 27, 1984.    --G.D. Searle andamp; Co., Aug. 27-31, 1984.    --Textron Inc., Oct. 1-5, 19, 1984.    --American Natural Resources, Feb. 14, 15, 22, 25, 28, March 1, 1985.    --McGraw Edison Co., March 14, 15, 19, 20, 1985.    --Houston Natural Gas, April 30, May 1, 1985.    The smallest pool contains $1,326, resulting from Mr. Levine's trading in Wallace Murray Corp. on Feb. 3, 1981, when he was relatively new to insider trading, according to the SEC chronology of his activities.    The SEC's plan for the distribution of Mr. Wilkis's profits follows the same lines as its plan for Mr. Levine's profits, but on a smaller scale. The total amount available for distribution is $2.8 million. Under the plan, about half would satisfy tax claims and half would be distributed to investors.    In June 1986, Mr. Levine, who had been an investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., pleaded guilty to securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. Information provided by Mr. Levine led the SEC to arbitrager Ivan Boesky, who last November agreed to an unprecedented $100 million settlement of insider-trading charges.    In December 1986, Mr. Wilkis, who had been an investment banker at Lazard Freres andamp; Co. and E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., pleaded guilty to four felony counts for his part in Mr. Levine's insider-trading scheme.    The SEC said in its supporting memorandum that Mr. Levine has asked that his $362,000 criminal fine be paid from his previously disgorged assets. It denounced that request as &quot;outrageous and clearly contrary to public policy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
