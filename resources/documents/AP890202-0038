Bernard Aronson, a Democrat and one-time aide to former VicePresident Walter Mondale, is best known for helping President Reaganbuild congressional support for military aid for the Contras in thesummer of 1986. It was the last time such aid won approval onCapitol Hill.   Although early signs are that Bush will not seek a renewal ofContra aid and instead will seek a diplomatic solution in CentralAmerica, Aronson is viewed on Capitol Hill as a moderate who couldappeal to members of both parties.   The anticipated appointment of Aronson comes at a time when boththe United States and Nicaragua's leftist government are showingsigns of interest in a more accommodating relationship, possiblyincluding the first direct U.S. discussions with the Sandinistas infour years.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III had considered a long listof alternate candidates for the post before settling on Aronson tobecome assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,widely regarded as one of the most demanding jobs in government.   The selection of Aronson indicates that Bush and Baker are intenton avoiding the kind of friction with Congress that accompanied theReagan administration's support of the Contra rebels.   Baker has indicated that he believes the Reagan administration'sinability to come up with a Central America policy acceptable toCongress was a major contributing factor to U.S. inability toachieve its objectives in that region.   He has been engaged in consultations with the Congress and haselicited favorable comments from House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex.,who helped engineer the defeat of the Contra aid request a year ago.   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams has calledthat vote perhaps his biggest disappointment in 3{ years as Reagan'stop aide for Latin America.   He maintains that the Sandinista government responded to the voteby increasing repression, accelerating aid to leftist rebels in ElSalvador and continuing to accept disproportionately high levels ofmilitary aid from the Soviet Union. He lists the 1988 Kremlin aidfigure at $500 million.   One long-time Contra aid opponent, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.,said he is cautiously optimistic he will be able to work well withAronson.   Aronson from 1977 to 1981 was a vice presidential speechwriterand deputy assistant to President Carter, and currently is on aCouncil on Foreign Relations study group on Central America. Theofficials who confirmed his appointment spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Reagan's departure appears to have had a dramatic impact onSandinista attitudes, including its policy towards Washington.   The Sandinistas announced on Inauguration Day that the StateDepartment will be allowed to send envoys to replace eight U.S.diplomats who were expelled from Managua last July.   President Daniel Ortega said last week he wants to ``normalizeall aspects of U.S.-Nicaraguan relations,'' and he also hasannounced cutbacks in military spending, a sore point for the Reaganadministration for years. Contra fighters, many of whom arelanguishing at camps inside Honduras, will be welcomed home withoutconditions, he said.   On Tuesday, the Sandinistas extended a unilateral cease-fire withthe Contras and lifted suspensions on two radio programs that hadbeen in effect since last fall and drawn critical State Departmentcomment.   Bush, meanwhile, has said little about Nicaragua since he beganhis election campaign last year, leaving the impression that he doesnot subscribe to Reagan's view that the Sandinista government, leftunchecked, will eventually represent a major security threat to theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
