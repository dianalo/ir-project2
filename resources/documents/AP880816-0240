Luis Monreal told a news conference that American, Canadian,Spanish, German and Egyptian scientists had designed thenitrogen-filled case on the basis that inert gases preserve organicmaterial and reduce biological growth.   He said the case also could be used to conserve pricelessantiquities such as manuscripts and objects made of organicmaterials including wood, leather and bone.   Monreal desplayed a small prototype of the case that ishermetically sealed.   ``The new thing is that it is simple, will not cost much andincludes a cocktail of nitrogen and oxygen,'' he said.   Getty scientists developed the proper mixture of 97 percentnitrogen and 3 percent oxygen and the prototype was first shown inCalifornia last May, according to Monreal. He said tests involved a3,000-year-old female mummy on loan from Egypt and other Egyptianmummies from American museums.   The first full-size case will be delivered to Egypt in Decemberand Egypt then is to build similar cases locally for its 27 royalmummies and put them on display, Monreal said.   The royal mummies, dating from 3,000 to 3,800 years ago, werediscovered in a common tomb in 1881 near the southern city of Luxorwhere ancient priests had hidden them from grave robbers.   They have been held in a closed hall at the Egyptian Museumafter being displayed from 1958 to 1980. Although thousands ofmummies have been found and displayed, the 27 are considered to bethe only royal mummies.   Plans to put them on display last summer were postponed untilthe new show cases could be developed.   Monreal said research in developing the case had cost theinstitute about $150,000.   ``That is a very low cost if what you are trying to save are themost precious specimens of Egyptian history,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
