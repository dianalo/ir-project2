No need to ask Mr. Knievel, a Butte native, who is first. Still, second place isn't bad, coming from a man who has launched himself and his motorcycle over Hell's Canyon and over 14 side-by-side dump trucks. But Mr. Washington, the 53-year-old entrepreneur from Missoula, Mont., took what many people in this state consider to be the longest shot of all two years ago when he bought and reopened Butte's moribund open-pit copper mine, once known as &quot;The Richest Hill on Earth.&quot;    By taking a chance on copper's comeback, Mr. Washington has become one of the richest men in Montana. His closely held Washington Cos. cleared $40 million on the mine in the past six months. The profit projection for the year, barring a copper crash: $100 million.    But consider the odds he faced: Copper prices were so depressed that giant Atlantic Richfield Co., after losing more than $750 million, closed the Butte mine and pulled out of the copper business altogether. Mr. Washington was reopening the mine as a non-union shop in a city whose union roots are deep and fierce. His investment banker was laughed out of four major New York banks while seeking backers. And Mr. Washington's experience as a mine operator was zip.    He managed to pull off his coup with the help of a recovering copper market. Since he reopened the mine in late 1986, copper has climbed from a floor of 59 cents a pound to as high as $1.47 -- and just over 94 cents yesterday.    The sheer audacity of the gamble -- and the size of the payoff -- has residents of this rough-and-tumble mining town drawing comparisons with Montana's legendary copper kings of a century ago. &quot;He kind of reminds me of my great grandfather, who made millions in the mines here -- until he got murdered,&quot; says Sandy Keith, owner of the Red Rooster Supper Club. A local attorney is similarly awed: &quot;To do what Dennis Washington did,&quot; he says, &quot;you've got to have a direct line to God.&quot;    Mr. Washington doesn't claim to have that. But as his new Falcon jet swings into the sky, he admits to some good fortune. &quot;We took a calculated risk,&quot; he says, &quot;and we're getting super rewarded.&quot;    Also taking a chance that copper would recover was Montana's State Board of Investment. It came up with an $8 million line of credit, the largest business loan in the board's history, after Mr. Washington put up $12 million of his own money to buy the mine. &quot;On paper it looked scary,&quot; says Robert Pancich, the board's administrative officer. &quot;But we decided to step up to the line and give it a try.&quot;    Butte took a gamble too, granting Mr. Washington three years of property-tax breaks worth some $4.8 million at a time when it could least afford it, having lost the mine and several other major employers. Their gamble has paid off, as each of the mine's 360 employees got a profit-sharing check equal to about a third of their yearly pay, plus an additional 10% bonus. The ripple effect from the mine's $10 million annual payroll has added more than 800 jobs and $18 million to the economy of Butte, a city of 35,000. &quot;Every time Dennis makes a million, I make a thousand,&quot; crows the Red Rooster's Mr. Keith.    Mr. Washington, who parlayed $30,000 borrowed in 1964 into Washington Cos., the state's biggest road and mine construction outfit, says he nearly gave up on the Butte mine. Last August, with copper hovering around 60 cents a pound, a series of start-up mishaps that included an ore-crusher failure and a bad case of mud seepage led him to the brink. &quot;We were the joke of the mining industry,&quot; he says.    When a group of Australian and British investors offered $50 million in cash for the mine, he invited them to the Missoula office to seal the deal. &quot;We were sitting around in my attorney's office, finishing off the details, and someone stuck his hand out for the final shake,&quot; Mr. Washington recalls. He started to reach for the hand, then pulled back and asked for another day to think it over; he says he still doesn't know why. &quot;I just had this feeling,&quot; he says.    After a sleepless night, Mr. Washington walked into the office the next day and announced the deal was off. Three weeks later, copper prices soared. &quot;That was the real gamble,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
