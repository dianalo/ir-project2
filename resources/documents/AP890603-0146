U.S. Magistrate Morton Sitver released David Foreman, 42, thefounder of the radical activist group Earth First!, on a $50,000unsecured bond after a 2{-hour detention hearing.   Sitver ordered Mark Leslie Davis, 39, Marc Baker, 37, andMargaret ``Peggy'' Millett, 35, all of Prescott, held for trial.Foreman, a Tucson resident, is charged with conspiracy, while theother three face a count each of conspiracy and three types ofproperty destruction.   Sitver said Davis and Mrs. Millett were flight risks as well asdangers to the community and he called Baker dangerous.   In arguing for Foreman's detention, Assistant U.S. AttorneyRoger Dokken claimed the activist was the ringleader.   ``Mr. Foreman is the worst of the group,'' Dokken said. ``Hesneaks around in the background. He was the financier, the leader,sort of the guru to get all of this going. I don't like to use theanalogy of a Mafia boss, but they never do anything either. Theyjust send their munchkins out to do it.''   Defense lawyers said the alleged conspirators always notifiedthe public during what they called ``monkeywrenching'' operations,a reference to a book written by the late Edward Abbey describing afictional plot by ``eco-raiders'' to blow up a dam.   Foreman's attorney, Richard Sherman of Jackson, Wyo., said hewas gratified by Foreman's release but added that all thedefendants should have been treated with the same consideration.   ``Apparently the magistrate felt they were a danger to society.I respectfully disagree,'' he said.   Baker, Davis and Millett were committed to attacks on the PaloVerde and Diablo Canyon nuclear complexes of Wintersburg, Ariz.,and San Luis Obispo, Calif., respectively, and the Rocky Flatsnuclear weapons center near Denver, according to FBI testimonybased on tape-recorded conversations.   FBI Agent Lori Bailey testified that Davis, Baker and Mrs.Millett took an undercover agent to a spot near Wenden, Ariz.,about 75 miles west of here, late Tuesday to practice knocking downmetal powerline towers.   The tower they chose provides power for a pumping station of theCentral Arizona Project, which carries water from the ColoradoRiver to Arizona's interior.   FBI agents on the ground and in a U.S. Customs Servicehelicopter arrested Davis and Baker at the site, but Mrs. Millettslipped through and escaped, Miss Bailey testified.   Foreman was arrested Wednesday morning in Tucson, and Mrs.Millett was arrested in Prescott Wednesday afternoon, Miss Baileysaid.   The FBI had been investigating the alleged conspiracy since aMay 1986 attempt to short-circuit Palo Verde powerlines by throwingmetal cables across high-tension wires, she said.   Miss Bailey testified that the undercover agent accompaniedDavis to Tucson several times and saw Foreman give Davis $580 andlater $100 to use in training two- or three-person groups for thestrikes.   Foreman opposed the idea of knocking out a CAP pumping stationas a useless goad against public sentiment but was enthusiasticabout hitting nuclear facilities, Miss Bailey said.   The magistrate set Foreman's surety bond for $50,000 butaccepted his signature for release. Sitver also ordered Foreman,who has written a field manual called ``Ecodefense: A Field Guideto Monkeywrenching,'' to supply names and addresses of any of hispublishers.   Foreman's book offers instructions on such actions as topplingpower-line towersw, putting spikes into trees to discourage loggerswith chain saws and knocking bulldozers and helicopters out oforder by putting sand in engine oil.   But the book carries a disclaimer of being ``for entertainmentpurposes only,'' saying, ``No one involved with the production ofthis book ... encourages anyone to do any of the stupid, illegalthings contained herein.''</TEXT></DOC>
