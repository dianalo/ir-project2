The storm fizzled as it moved east, but still left 1{ feet ofsnow on the ground this morning along the windy Wisconsin shore ofLake Superior and more than 20 inches in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.   ``For all practical purposes, it just kind of died as it movedinto Canada out of lower Michigan,'' said Pete Reynolds, aforecaster with the National Weather Service's Severe StormsForecasting Center in Kansas City, Mo.   ``The only significant snowfall right now is near the lakes dueto the lake effect,'' he said early today.   Three sisters were killed Sunday evening south of Waunakee,Wis., when the car they were riding in collided with a pickup truckon a snow-slick road, authorities said. The accident brought to sixthe number of deaths blamed on the storm since it hit the Midweston Thursday.   ``We have been bombarded with accidents,'' said Don Olson, astate trooper in Detroit, where expressways were glazed with iceSunday night. ``It's very treacherous.''   Marquette County in Upper Michigan had 80 weekend trafficaccidents, and all but major roads remained blocked by snow eventhough crews were working 12-hour shifts, state police Sgt. PaulNumikoski said Sunday.   Four inches of new snow was measured at Sawyer Air Force Basenear Marquette. South of Lake Erie, a heavy snow warning was postedthrough today in northeast Ohio.   Cold Canadian air pushed south in the wake of the storm. Hightemperatures today were expected to be much colder than normal forthe season from the lower Great Lakes to the central Gulf of Mexicocoast, and as much as 30 degrees colder than usual in the Ohio andTennessee valleys.   The storm had closed long sections of major highways in Wyoming,the Dakotas and Nebraska.   The last interstate to be reopened was I-90 across western SouthDakota, which was finally fully cleared late Saturday, said ToddSeaman, a state Transportation Department engineer in Rapid City.At the worst of the storm about 260 miles of it was shut down.   Fifteen-foot drifts were reported along I-90 in the Kadoka area,and Seaman said snow had drifted to the top of overpasses.   Crews in Dawes County in northwestern Nebraska, where more than30 inches of snow fell in some areas, were having trouble breakingthrough snowdrifts up to 10 feet high, and some ranchers couldn'treach their cattle, County Commissioner Waymann Wild said.   ``This is probably the worst we've had since 1949,'' he said.The county was hard-hit last year, ``but nothing like this.''   About 700 snowbound travelers who had crowded the small town ofKimball, Neb., since Thursday were told Sunday that roads werestill not in good shape but they could leave.   To the north, in South Dakota's Black Hills, hungry, snowboundskiers had to dig their cars out of 7 feet of snow to leave TerryPeak Lodge, manager Bob Ekeren said.   Two busloads of children who had been snowbound in isolatedfarmhouses in western Nebraska since Thursday got home safelySaturday afternoon. The 21 children were being driven home fromschool when the blizzard caught their drivers by surprise, forcingthem to seek shelter with farm families.   Four deaths in Wisconsin and two in South Dakota were blamed onthe storm.</TEXT></DOC>
