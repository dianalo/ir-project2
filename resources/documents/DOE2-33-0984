<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-33-0984 </DOCNO><TEXT>Linear polarisation, with respect to the z axis, and the effect of thesubsequent laser-induced excitation on the luminescence and transientoptical absorption induced by irradiation of crystalline SiO/sub 2/ withan electron pulse have been studied. It is found that the luminescencespectrum consists of two bands peaked at 2.8 eV and at 2.5 eV and thatthe transition dipole moment of the former, which has been shown to beintrinsic, is nearly parallel to the z axis, while that of the latteris parallel to the x axis. In addition to the 5.2 eV transient opticalabsorption band, a satellite band at 4.2 eV is found to be induced byirradiation with an electron pulse. For both of these bands, the transitiondipoles are found not to be parallel to any of the crystalline axes.Subsequent irradiation with a 4.0 or 5.6 eV laser pulse of a specimenirradiated with an electron pulse is found to eliminate both of thesetransient optical absorption bands and the 2.8 eV luminescence band.In view of previous work on optically detected magnetic resonance andvolume changes induced by electron pulse irradiation, it is concludedthat the 5.2 and 4.2 eV transient optical absorption bands and the 2.8eV luminescence band are associated with self-trapped excitons. The existingmodels of self-trapped excitons are discussed on the basis of the presentexperimental results.</TEXT></DOC>
