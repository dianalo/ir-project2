In a court session before U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson,Walsh said U.S. intelligence agencies are showing greaterflexibility than they did previously in regard to what classifiedmaterial may be declassified for trial.   Walsh also said some classified documents which caused theintelligence community concern in the North case aren't relevant inthe Poindexter case. He said he was willing to make the documentsavailable so that the defense can see for itself the ``lack ofrelevance.''   ``I think they are salvageable,'' Walsh said of conspiracy,theft and wire fraud counts. ``There has been a softening in theposition of the intelligence agencies.''   Due to national security concerns, conspiracy and theft countsagainst North were dismissed Jan. 13. Earlier, a charge of wirefraud against him also was dismissed.   North, who worked under Poindexter at the White House, has facedtrial on 12 remaining felony charges over the past 12 weeks. Hiscase is expected to go to the jury Thursday.   North, Poindexter and businessmen Richard Secord and AlbertHakim were indicted March 16, 1988,in the Iran-Contra affair. Allwere charged with conspiracy, theft of government property and wirefraud, as well as other crimes.   The conspiracy and theft counts accused them of illegallydiverting more than $14 million in Iran arms-sale proceeds to theNicaraguan rebels. The wire fraud count accused them of carryingout the diversion through telephone calls and other communications.   In court, Robinson said Poindexter's attorney Richard Becklershould submit a discovery request by May 15 for material he wantsto use.   Christian Mixter, an attorney in Walsh's office, asked that thedate be moved up, a request which made Poindexter, sitting at thedefense table, shake his head in displeasure. Robinson agreed togive the defense until May 15.   The conspiracy and theft counts in the North case founderedafter U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled Dec. 12 thatsignificant amounts of classified information could not be deletedfrom 300 documents Walsh wanted to use against North at trial.   Among the items the judge said would have to be disclosed inorder to ensure a fair trial were verbatim texts of intelligencereports and names of Central American countries.   The judge also insisted on including references to foreignofficials by their general importance and function, and alsoreferences to CIA officials and sources.   Faced with the refusal of intelligence agencies to declassify somuch information for use at North's trial, Walsh went into courtand asked Gesell to dismiss the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
