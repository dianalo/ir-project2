Sincethe start of operations, the performance of these units has been observedin order to determine their functioning and at the same time to learnthe problems associated with the large scale operations of this geothermalfield. This paper briefly describes the system and arrangement used,as well as the strategy at the origin of this project. Moreover, tablesare presented giving the updated information on the energy generatedand the installation factors for each unit, mentioning the principalproblems that have been encountered. 4 references, 3 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
