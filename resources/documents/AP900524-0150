PUGH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Freed Beirut hostage Frank Reed will see his91-year-old mother for the first time since his release when hereturns home Sunday to a hero's welcome, his daughter said Thursday.   ``I think what's kept her going for the past 3{ years is (that)this day will come,'' said Marilyn Langston. ``Once she sees himand touches him, that will be very, very wonderful for her.''   Ms. Langston, 33, said her grandmother, Leota Sprague, did nottravel to Frankfurt, West Germany to greet Reed, as younger familymembers did.   Reed grew up in Malden, a Boston suburb about five miles northof downtown. Malden Mayor James Conway said city residents wereexcited about the return of their native son.   ``We're delighted that he is coming home,'' Conway said. ``We'vebeen waiting patiently for this. We look forward to sharing in hisjoy and triumph.''   All over the city, yellow ribbons adorned businesses and homesto signify the vigil of those awaiting his return, Conway said. Inone city square, a billboard welcomes Reed back.   ``There's a lot of feeling that the fellow went through a lot,''Conway said. ``We've been remembering him in our prayers.''   Reed will receive an official welcome from the city when helands at Logan International Airport, including police escort toaccompany a limousine carrying the former hostage home, said LindaMcManus, executive director of the Malden Chamber of Commerce.   The city scheduled a parade to honor Reed on Tuesday, with theMalden High School band and city dignitaries attending, Ms. McManussaid.   The parade was scheduled after veterans complained abouttentative plans to honor Reed in conjunction with a Memorial Dayparade Monday. Ms. McManus said that wasn't the only reason forscheduling the second parade; it was also planned to allow Reed aday of rest at home.   ``The purpose of the (Memorial Day) parade is not a celebration,it's an observance for deceased war veterans,'' said MichaelImbracsio, 65, a World War II veteran and former state commander ofthe Veterans of Foreign Wars.   Reed, kidnapped in 1986 while serving as head of the privateLebanese International School, was held by Moslem extremists untillast month. Since his release, he has been recuperating andundergoing medical tests in Germany and since May 4 at Andrews AirForce Base in Maryland.   His daughter said Reed called her Thursday morning from theMalcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews to tell her he was arrivinghome Sunday.   Air Force Sgt. Eddie Riley, a spokesman for the hospital, saiddoctors there had said Reed would go to Massachusetts late Saturdayor early Sunday and return to the hospital Tuesday.   However, Reed's son-in-law, Bob Langston, said Reed told him heintended to participate in the parade and return to the hospitallater Tuesday or on Wednesday.   Reed's wife, Fahima, and their 9-year-old son, Tarek, have livedwith Mrs. Sprague in her two-bedroom Malden apartment for almost ayear.   ``I'm very pleased. I'm delighted. I can't wait,'' Mrs. Reedsaid Thursday.   Reed, 56, said he was beaten by his captors and blindfolded muchof the time. His daughter said he told her Thursday that he hadregained about 15 pounds of the 50 pounds he lost during the ordeal.   ``He's been playing golf,'' Ms. Langston said. ``They've had himout on the golf course at the base. He's also been undergoingphysical therapy to get him going.   ``I'm really happy that he will finally be seeing mygrandmother. I know she's going to be ecstatic.''   ``Of course it makes me feel grand,'' Mrs. Sprague said. ``We'reall very thrilled that he's coming back.''</TEXT></DOC>
