The outcome of Sunday's vote was a victory for President JulioM. Sanguinetti on an issue that had divided the nation for morethan two years.   He had predicted trouble if the amnesty, approved in 1986 afterrumblings in the barracks, were rejected. Soldiers who facedsimilar prosecution in neighboring Argentina have staged threerevolts in less than two years.   With 7,009 of 7,072 districts nationwide reporting, amnestysupporters tallied 1,008,925 votes, or 52.57 percent, whileopponents numbered 770,221 or 40.13 percent. About 140,049 votes,or 7.3 percent, were blank, annulled or ruled questionable fortechnical reasons.   Uruguay ``definitely has turned the page on the past,'' arelieved Vice President Enrique Tarigo said as the InteriorMinistry released official returns early today. ``There were nowinners or losers.''   About 180 soldiers and police had been accused of crimes duringthe dictatorship's war against leftist rebels. Thousands ofsuspected leftist sympathizers were arrested and tortured, 150 werekilled and 200 were never seen again.   The governing Colorado Party noted that in addition to theDecember 1986 amnesty for soldiers and police, leftist Tupamaroguerrillas were released from jail shortly after Sanguinetti tookoffice in March 1985.   Early today a co-president of the National Commission for aReferendum, a coalition of human rights and leftist politicalgroups that collected more than a half-million signatures to bringabout the referendum, conceded defeat.   But a disheartened Matilde Rodriguez Larreta, whose politicianhusband was assassinated by security forces in 1976, also calledfor a ``national compromise'' on the issue.   ``The country and all its institutions cannot be insensitive tothe circumstances that nearly one-half of the population disagreesradically'' with the amnesty, she told reporters.   The decision was accepted quietly by the public. There was nogloating by the victors or caravans of honking cars or fireworkssuch as occurred in December, when the Electoral Court said thereferendum would be held.   Sanguinetti last year predicted the amnesty law would survivethe referendum, saying overturning it carried the likelihood of a``long, hazardous ... and dramatic period of confrontation''between soldiers and civilians. The law was enacted as civil courtswere about call military officers to answer charges of murder,kidnapping and torture. Officers indicated they would ignorerequests to testify, setting up a potential clash with the   government.   The same issue in Argentina has led to three unsuccessfulmilitary insurrections there in the past 20 months against thegovernment of President Raul Alfonsin.      Official figures indicated that more than 83 percent of the 2.3million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory andfailure to do so is punishable by a small fine.   Supporters of the amnesty cast yellow ballots; opponents castgreen ones.   The ``greens'' did best in Montevideo, which is home to almosthalf the electorate, the traditional stronghold of the leftistparties. In the countryside, ``yellows'' dominated by margins of2-1 or more.   Jaime Perez, secretary general of the Communist Party, said thegovernment intimidated citizens into voting for the amnesty.   The government ``developed a campaign seeking to build upelements of fear and uncertainty of what would happen if the`greens' won,'' he told reporters. ``This campaign didn't take holdin Montevideo, but it did in the countryside.''   Sanguinetti, who was elected in November 1984 after democracywas restored, said before the vote that the country shouldconcentrate on the future, including national elections set forNov. 26.   Not all Uruguayans agreed.   Standing in line waiting to vote in the upper middle classneighborhood of Pocitos, a well-dressed woman said: ``A countrythat forgets its past has no future. A future of peace and justicedepends on overturning'' the amnesty.   She declined to give her name.</TEXT></DOC>
