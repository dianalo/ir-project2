Transportationsources are estimated to have been responsible for about 34% of 1985U.S. anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions, 70% of carbon monoxide emissions,45% of nitrogen oxide emissions, 24% of nonaerosol chlorofluorocarbonemissions, and 14% of carbon dioxide emissions. Data are presented describingpossible uninventoried transportation hydrocarbon emissions that couldincrease their estimated contribution to 45 - 50% of the anthropogenictotal. Data is also presented suggesting motor vehicles to be relativelyinsignificant sources of anthropogenic nitrous oxide, but noting thatthese emissions are increased by the control technologies used to reducehydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides emissions. The sensitivityof motor-vehicle emission rates and compositions to such operating variablesas ambient temperature, altitude, and average speed is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
