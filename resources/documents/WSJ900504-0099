The Family Leave Act, which goes into effect today, setsthe most generous leave policies in the nation and is a modelfor similar initiatives being considered in other states.Advocates say it is in the forefront of &quot;family friendly&quot;labor laws intended to attract and retain employees,particularly women.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;American businesses need to recognize that workers haveboth work responsibilities and family responsibilities, andthey need some accommodation of these competing needs,&quot; saysHelen Norton, staff attorney for the Women's Legal DefenseFund in Washington, D.C.   But many New Jersey employers view the new law withconcern and confusion. &quot;It's going to be very difficult foremployers, particularly in smaller companies where everyemployee is key,&quot; says James Morford, vice president of theNew Jersey Chamber of Commerce. In applying the law tocompanies of different sizes, he notes, &quot;there's noflexibility.&quot;   In its first year, the law requires companies with over100 employees to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave withbenefits every two years to employees facing the birth oradoption of a child or a serious illness in their immediatefamily. Upon returning, employees must be given the same oran equal job at the same pay.   Next year, the law will be extended to companies with morethan 75 employees and, the year after that, to companies with50 or more employees. At that time, the law will affectroughly 10,000 companies in New Jersey and about half thestate's employees. Employers who fail to comply can be finedup to $5,000 per violation and be sued for punitive damages.   The law is part of a legislative trend in many states --as well as recent efforts in Congress -- toward mandating anew balance between the workplace and employees' families.Since 1972, 25 states and Puerto Rico passed laws that insome form protect employees who must leave their jobstemporarily for family reasons.   Another 14 states have legislation pending. Most arevariations of New Jersey's law, but some go further.Lawmakers in Pennsylvania are considering a measure thatwould require companies with only 10 employees to provide upto 18 weeks of unpaid family leave and 26 weeks of unpaidmedical leave, with job-back guarantees. In Massachusetts,state legislators are considering similar leave provisionsrequiring employers to offer them with pay.   But New Jersey's law is the broadest. Most such lawsaddress only maternity leave. The concept of family leave --applying both to time off due to babies and seriously illfamily members -- is still foreign to many employers. And inalmost every state where leave benefits are mandatory,employees must assume the cost of company benefits, such ashealth insurance premiums, while on leave.   New Jersey is the only state that both mandates generousleave provisions and requires companies to pay for benefitswhile the employee is out. That worries many employers,business groups and labor management lawyers.   &quot;This totally ignores the realities of business,&quot; saysMarvin Goldstein, an attorney with the Roseland, N.J., laborlaw firm of Grotta, Glassman andamp; Hoffman, which representsmanagement.   Proponents say such laws are long overdue. More than halfof new mothers -- married women with children under a yearold -- have jobs, according to the Bureau of LaborStatistics. Traditional households with a working husband anda wife at home are at an all-time low -- 5% of all marriedcouples. Laws such as New Jersey's, proponents say, arenecessary as more women build careers and as fathers assumemore responsibility for child rearing. The laws alsorecognize that, with the population growing older and bothspouses working, employees increasingly need time off to carefor aging relatives.   Companies complain that New Jersey's law is going intoeffect without regulations defining its scope. It isn'tclear, for example, whether an employee is only someoneworking in the state or is anyone employed by a NewJersey-based company, even those working outside the state.   Employers also say that exemptions from the law areunclear and there is potential for abuse by employees. &quot;Thereare a lot of people out there who wouldn't mind taking 12weeks off, particularly with benefits and job reinstatement,&quot;says Steven W. Suflas, a labor attorney at Archer andamp; Greiner,a Haddonfield, N.J., law firm.   The civil rights division of the state Attorney General'soffice is expected to issue a legal opinion today answeringsome of these questions, and regulatory guidelines willfollow this summer.   Many employers say that state laws governing employeebenefits are anti-competitive, expensive and disruptive,particularly for companies in highly specialized fields.&quot;Employers need flexibility to structure a mix of wages,salaries and benefits in order to keep good workers,&quot; saysAnn Hurwitt, incoming president of the New Jersey Associationof Women Business Owners, which opposes the law. &quot;Mandatedbenefits ignore the diverse needs of employees and limit theoptions available in employment negotiations.&quot;   Unpaid leave could create special problems for smallcompanies in New Jersey and other states that follow itslead, says Carolyn Miller, a lobbyist for the NationalFederation of Independent Business in Washington, D.C. Thefederation, which represents small businesses and claims570,000 members nationwide, including 5,000 in New Jersey,has mounted intense lobbying efforts against family-leavelegislation. For smaller companies, particularly if the workinvolved is highly skilled, the ill-timed absence of one ortwo employees can be critical, says Ms. Miller.   At United Medical Corp., which specializes in providing24-hour electrocardiogram analysis and heart pacemakermonitoring, job training alone takes four to six weeks, saysMarian Wissman, the company's personnel director. TheHaddonfield, N.J., company has 500 employees, including 170in New Jersey. &quot;People don't just walk into this job,&quot; shesays.   Some large companies in New Jersey, such as Johnson andamp;Johnson in New Brunswick and Campbell Soup Co. in Camden,already offer leave benefits that equal or surpass the newstate requirements. But many companies, employers say, mayhave to scale back on other benefits in order to meet thecosts of complying with the law. Some employers also predicta new reluctance to hire and promote employees, particularlywomen, who they think may be more likely to need leaves.   &quot;Employers will have to make these calls,&quot; says Mr.Morford of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. &quot;It addsanother foggy dimension to hiring and promotion practices.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
