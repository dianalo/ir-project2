After declining for most of the day, the Nasdaq Composite Index got a boost from a burst of computer-driven buying. Traders said stock-index arbitragers bought the OTC's largest stocks that are part of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index. The arbitrage traders buy and sell stocks and stock futures, trying to take advantage of price discrepancies between the two. Movements in the Sandamp;P 500 often trigger such &quot;program&quot; buying of stocks.    As a result, the Nasdaq composite improved 0.44 to 467.19. The Nasdaq Financial Index declined 0.03 to 463.10, while the Nasdaq 100 Index of large nonfinancial stocks rose 1.28 to 442.92.    Among the big stocks that were briskly traded, MCI Communications dropped 1/8 to 39 1/8 on 1.4 million shares. First Executive eased 3/8 to 11 1/2 on slightly more than one million shares. Volume totaled almost 954,000 shares in Intel, which slipped 1/4 to 30 3/4.    But Micron Technology added 3/4 to 14 3/4 on 584,000 shares and Seagate Technology improved 1/4 to 12 3/4 on 571,000 shares.    Class A shares of Tele-Communications jumped 1 1/4 to 40 on 518,000 shares. Tele-Communications called for early redemption of the $114 million outstanding of its 12 3/8% senior subordinated debentures due 2003.    In a statement, the company said that the retirement of this debenture issue, coupled with a previous debt retirement, should result in Tele-Communications saving $12 million annually over the next 10 years.    Additionally, Barney Schotters, vice president of finance at Tele-Communications, said that the debentures slated for redemption contained covenants that restrict the company's purchase of its common shares. He said the company currently has no plans for a big stock repurchase. But, he acknowledged that the company will have much more flexibility regarding a stock repurchase than it did in the past.    Another large-capitalization OTC issue, Ashton-Tate also gained on heavy volume.    Overall, trading activity, which often is calm on Mondays, was particularly sedate yesterday. Many traders and investors were either vacationing or beginning the Labor Day holiday early, traders said. Share turnover totaled only 100.2 million shares. For the month, average daily volume stands at roughly 132.2 million shares. That's just below the daily average of 132.9 million shares so far this year.    Meridian Bancorp, which last Friday offered to buy First Pennsylvania for about $704 million in stock, said it agreed to purchase about $30 million in First Pennsylvania warrants held by Marine Midland Banks. The warrants represent 24.9% of First Pennsylvania. On the news, Meridian lost 2 1/4 to 23. More than 900,000 Meridian shares changed hands.    The transaction hinges on Meridian's reaching an agreement to acquire the balance of First Pennsylvania. Marine Midland has an agreement to acquire First Pennsylvania for $15 a share, or $600 million, in 1990.    In other takeover news, Bel Fuse was unchanged at 6 1/4. The company said it rejected a proposed $7.50-a-share acquisition offer from Santa Monica Partners and Initio Inc.    Shares of Durr-Fillauer Medical, a medical supply distributor, slipped 1/4 to 19 on 489,000 shares. The company said there is no news that would have prompted the selling.    Cordis gained 1 1/4 to 14 1/4 after Prudential-Bache reiterated a &quot;strong buy&quot; recommendation for the company, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Flight International Group plunged 2 3/8 to 6 3/4 after saying it may report a first-quarter loss of about $1.6 million for the period ended July 31. The company earned about $548,000 in the year-earlier quarter.    Duty Free International added 3 1/2 to 45, spurred by the company's report that it earned 69 cents a share in the second quarter, compared with 49 cents a share a year earlier.    Canonie Environmental dropped 2 to 17 1/2 after it said it expects to report a small loss for the second quarter ending Thursday. In the year-earlier second quarter, the company reported net income of $1.7 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $13.5 million. The environmental waste management company said delays in completing a major project resulted in added costs and lower profit margins.    Groundwater Technology lost 1 to 26 1/4. Late Friday, the company announced that its president and chief executive officer, Paul Sanders, intends to resign this fall.    Radiation Systems rose 1 3/8 to 11 3/8. The company, which earlier this month announced a big order to supply antennas for news programs to schools, is the subject of a favorable article in the current issue of Barron's. </TEXT></DOC>
