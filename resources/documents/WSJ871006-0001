The electronic system is expected to be approved, Chicago Merc officials and members said. A relatively modest amount of opposition is expected from Merc floor traders fearful of losing business to the automated market, which generally would operate before and after the exchange's hours.    The Chicago Merc developed the Post (Pre) Market Trade, or PMT, system with Reuters Holdings PLC, mainly to tap into the growing market in overseas futures trading. Traders will be able to trade futures and futures options over the system using Reuters' nearly 130,000 computer terminals world-wide. PMT will operate during the 16 hours in which most Merc trading pits are closed.    The system, which still requires regulatory approval and approval from the Reuters board, won't be fully operational for at least 18 months. </TEXT></DOC>
