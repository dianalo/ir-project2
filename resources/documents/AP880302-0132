RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today gave cities, at leastfor now, additional protection from lawsuits that accuselower-ranking city officials of violating the rights of employees.   By a 7-1 vote, the justices threw out a $15,000 award St. Louiswas ordered to pay James J. Praprotnik, a fired city architect.   But the seven justices voting to overturn the award were sharplysplit in their reasoning. Only four justices joined in the court'smain opinion, leaving open the possibility that a future case couldprompt a different result.   Today's ruling, therefore, may leave local officials confusedover what standards apply in determining when cities can be heldlegally responsible for violating individual rights.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the court's main opinion,said cities may not be held liable unless those who claim theirrights were violated prove the ``existence of an unconstitutionalmunicipal policy.''   She said Praprotnik cannot win his case by claiming thathigh-ranking city officials _ such as the mayor and city aldermen _failed to override decisions by subordinates who may have violatedPraprotnik's rights.   ``Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one'ssubordinates ... is not a delegation to them of the authority tomake policy,'' O'Connor said.   Praprotnik was a manager in St. Louis' community developmentagency when in 1980 he became embroiled with his superiors over theproposed installation by the city of a controversial sculpture.   Praprotnik was suspended for 15 days but the city civil servicecommission reinstated him with back pay.   Then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency, theheritage and urban design division, and his job responsibilitieswere reduced. The transfer also meant a loss in seniority thatexposed him to being laid off.   He was fired Dec. 30, 1983, a day after he was released from ahospital where he had undergone surgery. The layoff cost him hisincome, more than 500 hours of accumulated sick leave and otherpension and vacation benefits.   City officials said he was fired for budgetary reasons.   Praprotnik then sued under a federal civil rights law, charginghe was shunted to a dead-end job and then kicked out because of hisappeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in1980.   A jury awarded him $30,000. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals reduced the amount to $15,000.   The appeals court said there was sufficient evidence to supportPraprotnik's claim that he was fired for exercising hisconstitutional rights.   The appeals court said the city was liable, even though the juryexonerated the individual officials sued by Praprotnik.   O'Connor said the appeals court's ruling was too broad inallowing the city to be sued based on decisions made by those wholacked policy-making authority.   Federal courts are not ``justified in assuming that municipalpolicy-making authority lies somewhere other than where theapplicable (state) law purports to put it,'' she said.   In Praprotnik's case, she said, that authority rests with themayor, the city aldermen and the civil service commission.   The justices ordered further lower court hearings in the case todetermine whether Praprotnik still has a viable case.   O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.   Justice William J. Brennan, in a separate opinion, said he wasworried that the court's main opinion embraces ``a theory ofmunicipal liability that is both unduly narrow and unrealistic andone that ultimately would permit municipalities to insulatethemselves from liability for the acts of all but a small minorityof actual city policymakers.''   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.Blackmun.   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, voting to upholdPraprotnik's lower court victory. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whoonly recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision.   The case is St. Louis vs. Praprotnik, 86-772.</TEXT></DOC>
