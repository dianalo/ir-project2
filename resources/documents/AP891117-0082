In an order issued Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge HaroldGreene said Poindexter ``may serve upon former President Reagan andupon the archivist of the United States the subpoenas ... submittedto the court.''   The archivist has possession of presidential records of theReagan administration. Reagan took his diary with him when he leftthe White House.   Greene's ruling marks the first time in the Iran-Contra scandalthat a judge has approved a subpoena for documents from Reagan.   Poindexter's lawyers say they want Reagan's diary as well asnotes he took at key meetings with his national security adviser,but it is unclear what the subpoenas demand, since Greene did notdisclose their contents.   The judge ruled last month that Poindexter, who was Reagan'snational security adviser, is entitled to subpoena ``specific,relevant documents'' bearing on the criminal charges against him.   Reagan's lawyers, who on Thursday night declined to comment, arealmost certain to challenge the subpoenas, but the JusticeDepartment may be less likely to step into a legal battle.   Reagan, asked by reporters in Cincinnati about the subpoena,said, ``Cases like that before the law, I don't comment.''   The Justice Department will examine the Reagan subpoena in lightof the 1974 Supreme Court ruling on the Watergate tapes, said aJustice Department source, speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``We are in the process of reviewing'' Greene's order ``todetermine what action we should take, if any,'' said JusticeDepartment spokesman David Runkel.   If it chose to do so, the department could object to thesubpoena on behalf of the former president, as it did earlier thisyear in urging that a subpoena be quashed seeking Reagan'sappearance at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial.   During the Watergate scandal, the court ruled that PresidentNixon had to comply with a subpoena from the special prosecutor toproduce tape recordings of 64 conversations. The court ruled thatthe specific need for the evidence in a criminal case outweighedthe president's rights in the matter.   Poindexter says that in regard to his actions that led to hisindictment in the Iran-Contra affair, Reagan ``formulated'' theposition on some matters and ``entertained Poindexter's planswithout voicing any objection'' on others, according to a courtopinion Greene issued last month.   ``It appears that notes were taken by the president and otherson these conversations,'' said the judge.   Poindexter asserts that ``these notes or presidential diaryentries made pursuant thereto would support his defense'' to thecriminal charges against him, Greene noted.   Poindexter has said he met daily, frequently alone with thepresident during the Iran-Contra affair.   Poindexter, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22, is underindictment on two counts of making false statements to Congress,two counts of obstruction and one count of conspiracy. He isaccused of obstructing Congress by denying that the NationalSecurity Council staff was offering tactical advice or solicitingfunds for the Contras.   Earlier this year, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesellquashed a subpoena for documents sought from Reagan in the caseagainst Oliver North.   Among other topics, Poindexter said he and the presidentdiscussed the accuracy of a chronology on the Iran-Contra affair.   The chronology said that no official in the U.S. governmentlearned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped toIran in November 1985.   The CIA-assisted shipment, overseen by North, who keptPoindexter informed on its progress, occurred without the existenceof a presidential finding as required by law. Reagan signed aretroactive finding the month after the Hawks were transported toIran.   Poindexter also said Reagan took notes of discussions focusingon how to respond to congressional inquiries about whether theadministration was secretly assisting the Contras during acongressional ban on the use of appropriations by intelligenceagencies to aid the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
