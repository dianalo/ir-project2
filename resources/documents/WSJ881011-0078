The discount retailer's shares shot up $6.125 to close at $26.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Adler andamp; Shaykin, which has used similar buy-out plans to gain controlling interests in Joy Manufacturing Co. and Chicago Sun-Times Co., said it would make a tender offer for all of Best's 24.9 million shares outstanding for about $684.8 million. The assumption of Best's debt and expenses connected with the offer are expected to bring the total funds needed for the acquisition to about $1.1 billion.    Financing is to be provided by Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.    The agreement appears to end weeks of takeover speculation about the company. Late last month, Best rejected as inadequate an unsolicited bid of $21 a share, or $522 million, from a company it didn't identify. On Friday, Best's board met in New York to review five formal offers. Best's chairman, Robert Huntley, said the board accepted the Adler andamp; Shaykin bid because it was the highest and had &quot;no unwanted conditions.&quot;    Adler andamp; Shaykin has indicated it will keep the company's management team in place and won't make major changes in operations. &quot;I don't anticipate any spinoff of assets,&quot; Mr. Huntley said.    Leonard Shaykin, a managing partner, said the firm &quot;doesn't have a precise game plan&quot; for Best, but it has a &quot;number of ideas&quot; it eventually will discuss with management. Mr. Shaykin said his firm's general approach &quot;is not to break up companies or dramatically change operations.&quot;    Under terms of the agreement, Best will pay Adler andamp; Shaykin $25 million if the transaction is terminated &quot;under certain circumstances.&quot; In addition, Best will reimburse the buyer for its out-of-pocket expenses up to $7.5 million.    Mr. Shaykin praised Best management for &quot;a wonderful job over the last three years in restructuring and getting control of its business. We would like to continue that.&quot; Mr. Shaykin said the strategy will be to &quot;strengthen their current business&quot; by improving Best's merchandising. He declined to discuss specific steps his firm might take.    In 1986, Best undertook a major restructuring, selling 49 unprofitable stores and taking an extraordinary charge of $42 million for the year ended Jan. 31, 1987. That produced a loss of $25.6 million. A year later, Best posted a profit of $30.5 million on sales of $2.07 billion. Like others in the catalog-showroom business, Best has been hurt by stepped up competition and better service from such traditional discount retailers as K mart Corp.    When Best surfaced recently as a merger or takeover candidate, Service Merchandise Co. of Nashville, Tenn., was cited frequently by analysts as a likely buyer. In August, an investment group including Prospect Group Inc., another New York leveraged buy-out fund, disclosed it held a 9.9% stake in Best and might seek talks with management on acquiring the company.    Neither Mr. Shaykin nor Best's Mr. Huntley indentified any of the four other bidders whose offers were considered Friday.    The price offered by Adler andamp; Shaykin surprised analysts who had predicted the Richmond, Va., company might fetch in the low $20s, given the company's flat sales and its concentration in the mature catalog showroom business. R. Hutchings Vernon, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore, said management &quot;got a very good price -- about $4.50 higher than I thought it would be.&quot;    The biggest challenge for new owners, he said, will be to increase sales while maintaining recent improvements in gross margins. Mr. Vernon also predicted that Adler andamp; Shaykin might concentrate on Best's jewelry business and mail-order operations, particularly office products for home offices or small businesses.    Michael Mead, an analyst with Scott andamp; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va., said Adler andamp; Shaykin might try to tap the value in Best's real estate, but it will be acquiring a mature business that may prove difficult to grow. </TEXT></DOC>
