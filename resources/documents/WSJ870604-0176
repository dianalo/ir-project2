Hazlett</HL><DD> 06/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   For 50 years, U.S. radio and television have been regulated in the way that presses were regulated in Olde England: by license from the crown. A sweeping and compelling history of this ongoing episode, Lucas A. Powe Jr.'s &quot;American Broadcasting and the First Amendment&quot; (University of California, 295 pages, $25) dramatically establishes that neither wise bureaucrats nor a hearty free speech tradition have been sufficient to keep the Constitution from being shaved.    The central contradiction in U.S. regulation of the communications media is that Federal Communications Commission licensees are evaluated in the &quot;public interest,&quot; whereas newspapers, even when unchallenged in one-paper towns, enjoy an air-tight immunity from local, state or federal intrusion. They do not apply for a license to publish; they are under no &quot;equal time&quot; or &quot;fairness&quot; requirements; even a tax on newsprint would be found illegal (as a Minnesota law was, by the Supreme Court in 1983). In contrast to this laissez-faire stands the federal license program for broadcasters who compete 2 to 12 abreast in TV, and 40 to 50 abreast in radio.    As Mr. Powe informs us, the uses of licensing have been blatantly political. The old Federal Radio Commission of President Hoover forced left-leaning labor unions to relinquish their ownership of radio stations. But &quot;not surprisingly, the first president to comprehend {licensing's} political potential was FDR.&quot; New Dealers complained that newspaper publishers were notoriously unenlightened; their solution was a ban on radio-station ownership by newspapermen.    At the dawn of the television era, Mr. Powe continues, &quot;The Eisenhower FCC managed what Roosevelt and later Nixon only dreamed of doing. Friends were brought to the public trough and given both an outlet to the voters and an opportunity for enormous profits. The participation of opponents was essentially limited to transferring money from themselves to their lawyers.&quot;    Mr. Powe toasts our 200th constitutional anniversary appropriately, with his systemic dissection of the abundant rationales for press regulation that have allowed governments (mostly federal but now, with cable, the municipalities) to treat the first amendment as yesterday's news. The result has been just the sort of political shenanigans the street-wise Founding Fathers tried to prevent.    The Fairness Doctrine and equal-time provisions, for example, have substituted regulated debate for wide-open discourse. Mr. Powe highlights the perversity of the rules with the fact that the historic Kennedy-Nixon debate was available for American audiences only after the famed Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934 -- which assured equal time to all candidates -- was temporarily suspended by Congress. (A Democratic Congress sat on a 1964 waiver, and thereby stifled debate to Lyndon Johnson's net advantage.)    But the very essence of a law forcing all outlets to air all sides is fantastic and anti-democratic. Imagine the effect of a rule saying all controversial books -- or this newspaper -- had to &quot;fairly&quot; report all views or face government sanctions? Yet in 1938-41, the Yankee Network station in Boston was scrutinized for its conservative editorials and came within an eyelash of losing its radio license. It was saved only by the station's 1941 plea to the FCC that from September 1938, &quot;no attempt has ever been or will ever be made to color or editorialize the news received.&quot; The broadcaster's solution was clear, notes Mr. Powe: &quot;No more editorials.&quot;    Similarly, the Kennedy-Johnson years were characterized by equal &quot;fairness&quot; zeal: &quot;Our strategy,&quot; detailed President Kennedy's assistant secretary of commerce, &quot;was to use the Fairness Doctrine to challenge and harass right-wing broadcasters and hope that the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too expensive to continue.&quot;    Leave it to Nixon to leave behind the smoking gun. Mr. Powe cites the Nixon tapes (Sept. 15, 1972):    President: &quot;The main thing is the Post is going to have damnable, damnable problems out of this one. They have a television station . . . and they're going to have to get it renewed.&quot;    Haldeman: &quot;They've got a radio station, too.&quot;    President: &quot;Does that come up, too? The point is, when does it come up?&quot;    Dean: &quot;I don't know. But the practice of non-licensees filing on top of licensees has certainly gotten more . . . active in . . . this area.&quot;    President: &quot;And it's going to be Goddamn active here.&quot;    Dean: (Laughter)(Silence)   Mr. Powe, a law professor at the University of Texas, has written an intellectually sophisticated and philosophically cogent book, which leads inexorably to the conclusion that salvaging old protections for new media would be a swell way to remember Madison and Jefferson and the other framers. In this, it is a powerful work that rivals the late Ithiel de Sola Pool's grand 1983 treatise, &quot;Technologies of Freedom.&quot;    The First Amendment as an abstraction will be feted as the cornerstone of our democracy this birthday year; Mr. Powe's sober volume challenges us to honor our great traditions in fact.    ---   Prof. Hazlett is an economist at the University of California, Davis, and a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. </TEXT></DOC>
