President F.W. de Klerk has said that in 1991 the governmentwill amend the law segregating residential areas by race. But agrowing number of blacks, Indians and people of mixed-race areseeking and receiving official permission to move to whiteneighborhoods even before Parliament changes the law, The SundayStar of Johannesburg said.   The newspaper said that when the government received anindividual request by a non-white to live in white area, approvaloften was sent in less than 24 hours.   ``As yet I have not had a permit refused,'' one unidentifiedreal estate agent told The Sunday Star.   The report gave no indication of how many applications have beenapproved in recent weeks or months. Government offices were closedSunday and officials could not be reached for comment.   The Group Areas Act, passed in 1950, segregates South Africanresidential areas by race and is considered one of the pillars ofapartheid.   However, tens of thousands of blacks in recent years have movedillegally into inner-city neighborhoods officially reserved forwhites. A far smaller number has applied for and receivedpermission.   The government has largely stopped prosecuting allegedviolations of the Group Areas Act, although dozens of bureaucratsare assigned to enforce the measure. Last week prosecutors dropped11 cases against 30 people.   The government also has opened four small neighborhoods to allraces.   De Klerk wants to amend the Group Areas Act but has said heopposes its repeal. He has not spelled out a new plan, but has saidthe new law must be supported by a majority of South Africans.   There is a surplus of housing for the 5 million whites in SouthAfrica, but blacks face a critical shortage. Several million of thecountry's 28 million blacks live in squatter shacks.</TEXT></DOC>
