These SIP revisions must also provide for attainment of the secondaryNAAQS as soon as practicable. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The primary SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS is violated when, in a calendar year, either: 1) the annualarithmetic mean value of SO<T2>2</T2> concentration exceeds 80 micrograms per cubic meter of air (80ug/m3) (the annual primary standard), or 2) the maximum 24-hour concentrationof SO<T2>2</T2> at any site exceeds 365 ug/m3 more than once (the 24-hour primarystandard). The secondary SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS is violated when the maximum 3-hour concentration at anysite exceeds 1300 ug/m3 more than once. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Portions of Lake and Porter Counties are designated ``Doesnot meet primary standards'', i.e., primary nonattainment for SO<T2>2</T2>, while the remaining portions of these counties are designated``Better than national standards'', i.e., attainment. Dearborn County isdesignated ``Cannot be classified'', i.e., unclassifiable, for SO<T2>2</T2>. The requirements for an approvable SIP are described in a ``General Preamble''for Part D rulemaking published at 44 FR 20372 (April 4, 1979), 44 FR 38583(July 2, 1979), 44 FR 50371 (August 28, 1979), 44 FR 53761 (September 17,1979), and 44 FR 67182 (November 23, 1979). In addition, section 110(a)(2)of the Act requires the State to adopt rules sufficient to assure attainmentand maintenance of the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS in the unclassifiable and attainment areas in the remainderof the State. <ITAG tagnum="84">Status of Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP </ITAG>On March 12, 1982 (47 FR 10813), and May 13, 1982 (47 FR 20583), USEPAapproved or conditionally approved Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> SIP for most areas of the State. In the March 12, 1982, rulemaking,USEPA conditionally approved the plan for Lake County and disapproved theplans for Dearborn and Porter Counties. It took no action in both of thoserulemakings on one of three compliance methods contained in Indiana's 1980SO<T2>2</T2> regulation (325 IAC 7-1), i.e., the sulfur content in fuel averagingmethod which is based on 30-day averaging. On May 11, 1984, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit setaside USEPA's approval of the SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits in Indiana's revised plan, because USEPA didnot rulemake on the 30-day averaging compliance method contained in therule. See <T3>Indiana andamp; Michigan Electric Company (IMEC) v. USEPA, </T3>733 F.2d489. Based on this decision and another recent decision, <T3>Sierra Club v. Indiana-Kentucky Electric Company, </T3>716 F.2d 1145(7th Cir. 1983, USEPA determined that there were no federally enforceableSO<T2>2</T2> emission limits regulating most existing sources in Indiana;\3\<NOTE/> and Indiana no longer had an approvable SO<T2>2</T2> plan. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ New sources constructed under, (or existing sources limitedby construction of new sources under), USEPA-approved new source review(NSR) regulations, USEPA's prevention of significant deterioration (PSD)regulations, or USEPA's new source performance standards (NSPS) regulationsremain bound by the SO<T2>2</T2> emission limitations required by these regulations or permitsissued based on these regulations. These limits continue to be fully enforceable;and, unless they are supplemented by more stringent limits in the revisedcounty-specific rules, these limits are inherent parts of the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> attainment plans being proposed for approval in today's notice.On February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3452), USEPA published a notice of proposedrulemaking on the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> plan. That notice proposed to disapprove Indiana's overall SO<T2>2</T2> plan, because the 30-day averaging compliance methodology inthe rule (325 IAC 7-1-3) was inconsistent with protection of the 3-hourand 24-hour SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS; and the stack test methodology, which is consistent withshort-term emission limits, was not independently enforceable. For 77 ofIndiana's 92 counties, this was the only basis for the proposed disapprovalof Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> plan.\4\<NOTE/> For the remaining 15 counties, technical deficiencies werenoted as well.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ These 77 Counties are: Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Benton,Blackford, Boone, Brown, Carroll, Cass, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Crawford,Daviess, Decator, Dekalb, Delaware, Dubois, Elkhart, Fayette, Fountain,Franklin, Fulton, Grant, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Harrison, Hendricks,Henry, Howard, Huntington, Jackson, Jasper, Jay, Jennings, Johnson, Knox,Kosciusko, LaGrange, Lawrence, Madison, Marshall, Martin, Miami, Monroe,Montgomery, Newton, Noble, Ohio, Orange, Owen, Parke, Perry, Pike, Pulaski,Putham, Randolph, Ripley, Rush, St. Joseph, Scott, Shelby, Spencer, Starke,Steuben, Switzerland, Tippecanoe, Tipton, Union, Vanderburgh, Wabash, Warren,Washington, Wells, White, and Whitley. All of these counties are designated``Better than National Standards'' for SO<T2>2</T2> (40 CFR 81.315).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The remaining 15 counties are: Dearborn, Floyd, Gibson,Jefferson, Lake, LaPorte, Marion, Morgan, Porter, Posey, Sullivan, Vermillion,Vigo, Warrick, and Wayne Counties. USEPA has recently approved Indiana'splan for eight of these counties (Jefferson, LaPorte, Marion, Posey, Sullivan,Vermillion, Vigo, and Wayne). USEPA proposed rulemaking on Warrick, Floydand Morgan Counties on August 3, 1988 (53 FR 29236 and 29239). Indiana'splan for Gibson County was also recently proposed for approval. Today,USEPA is proposing rulemaking on the last three of these counties (Dearborn,Lake, and Porter).USEPA's February 4, 1987, notice indicated that correction of the identifieddeficiency in the compliance methodology rule would allow USEPA to reinstateits March 12, 1982 (47 FR 10813), final approval for these 77 counties.On March 12, 1987, Indiana submitted to USEPA for ``parallel processing''\6\<NOTE/> its proposed revised compliance methodology rule, 325 IAC7-1-3.1, as preliminarily adopted by the Board on March 4, 1987.\7\<NOTE/> The revised compliance methodology rule replaces 325 IAC7-1-3 in the 1980 version of 325 IAC7-1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The generic procedures for ``parallel processing'' aredescribed at 47 FR 22073 (June 7, 1982). The State and USEPA propose rulemakingat roughly the same time, announce concurrent comment periods, and jointlyreview public comments. The State and USEPA then coordinate resolutionof any deficiencies prior to the State's final adoption of the rule. Ifthe State's rule, as finally adopted, is substantially identical to theproposed rule, then USEPA will take final action on the rule shortly followingits submittal to USEPA. On the other hand, if the final rule is substantiallydifferent than the proposed rule, then USEPA may publish a rulemaking noticereproposing action, as necessary.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For the exact language of 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, see 52 FR 27017(July 17, 1987).The revised rule includes a stack test compliance method and either a 30-dayor a calendar month averaging fuel analysis method (depending upon thesize of the source), each of which may be used at any time to determinecompliance or non-compliance with source emission limitations.\8\<NOTE/> However, a determination of non-compliance through the useof one method cannot be refuted by evidence of compliance through the othermethod. It also includes recordkeeping and reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Although the rule contains a 30-day averaging compliancemethodology for certain sources and monthly averaging for others, for purposesof this notice, this combination of methodologies will be referred to as``30-day averaging''.In accordance with the February 4, 1987, proposed rulemaking notice, onJuly 17, 1987 (52 FR 27016), USEPA (1) proposed for parallel processingto approve 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, because it provides for the independent useof stack testing to determine compliance with the SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits in 325 IAC 7-1; (2) proposed to reinstate theother provisions of 325 IAC 7-1; and (3) proposed to reinstate its approvalof Indiana's plan for the 77 counties, based on the revised compliancemethodology.On October 21, 1987, Indiana submitted 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, as promulgatedby the State on September 24, 1987. On January 19, 1988 (53 FR 1354), USEPAapproved this rule for inclusion into the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP statewide; reinstated the other general provisions of 325IAC 7-1 (1980), i.e., 325 IAC 7-1-1, 2 (except for any emission limitsin the 15 counties), 4, 5, 6, and 7 statewide; and, based on its approvalof the revised compliance methodology, reinstated its approval of Indiana'sSO<T2>2</T2> plan for the 77 counties.Indiana has also submitted county-specific plans for parallel processingfor the other 15 counties, including Dearborn, Lake, and Porter Counties.These plans consist of source-specific emission limits for certain sources,with the remainder of the sources in each county limited by the underlying6.0 pounds per million British Thermal Units (lbs/MMBTU) emission limitin 325 IAC 7-1-2.\9\<NOTE/> Additionally, all sources are subject to the remaining requirementsof 325 IAC 7-1, as modified with new compliance methodology 325 IAC 7-1-3.1.(As noted before, the general requirements of 325 IAC 7-1 (with the exceptionof the 6.0 lbs/MMBTU emission limit in 325 IAC 7-1-2) were reinstated asa portion of the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP for all counties, and new compliance methodology 325 IAC7-1-3.1 was approved for all counties on January 19, 1988.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Indiana has recently recodified its rules from Title 325to Title 326. All rules in today's notice will be codified under Title326 when submitted instead of 325. This in no way affects the substanceof the rules, and USEPA will take final action upon then using the codificationin which they are promulgated and submitted by the State.USEPA is proposing to approve, under parallel processing, Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> plans for Dearborn, Lake, and Porter Counties. This proposedapproval specifically includes (1) the source-specific emission limitsand other requirements in Indiana's county-specific rules, and (2) the6.0 lbs/MMBTU emission limit in 325 IAC 7-1-2, which is applicable to allother sources not specifically listed in the county-specific rules (exceptthe sources described by footnote 3 and in Lake County). Under USEPA'sparallel processing procedures, these county-specific rules must be fullyState-adopted, enforceable, and submitted as a revision to Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> SIP before USEPA can take final rulemaking action to approvethem.Specific plans for each county follow. Additionally, technical supportdocuments more fully explaining each plan are available at the addresseslisted in the front of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Dearborn, Lake and Porter Counties</ITAG>On February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3452), USEPA proposed to disapprove the Indianasulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Dearborn, Lake and PorterCounties. In response to USEPA's proposed rulemaking, revised SIPs weresubmitted by the State of Indiana. Based on the available technical support,the revised emission limitations,\10\<NOTE/> along with the revised compliance test method rule, constitutean acceptable SIP for Dearborn, Lake and Porter Counties.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ These limits are enforceable by the stack test methodin 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, thus protecting the 3-hour SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS. All sources in Dearborn, Lake, and Porter Counties mustbe in compliance with the emission limits in Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> rule at all times, as determined by 325 IAC 7-1-3.1. Malfunctionsare regulated by 325 IAC 1-1.5, as approved on February 14, 1984 (49 FR5618).<ITAG tagnum="84">Dearborn County</ITAG>USEPA noted two major deficiencies with the SIP for Dearborn County inits February 4, 1987, proposed rulemaking: (1) A compliance test methodinconsistent with the short-term SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS, and (2) several technical problems with the State's attainmentdemonstration. On October 21, 1987, the State submitted a revised compliancetest method rule (325 IAC 7-1-3.1). On January 19, 1988, USEPA approvedthis rule for all 92 counties in Indiana (see 53 FR 1354). Thus, this issuehas been resolved.On April 20, 1988, the State submitted for parallel processing a revisedrule, 326 IAC 7-1-20, for Dearborn County. (The previous SO<T2>2</T2> plan for Dearborn County was withdrawn on December 22, 1987.)The new rule specifies the following emission limitations for the fourmain sources in the County: \11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ All other sources in the county remain governed by 6.0lbs/MMBTU emission limit in 325 IAC 7-1-2(b).(a) Indiana Michigan Power Co._Tanners Creek:<ITAG tagnum="16">Units 1-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">1.2 lbs/MMBTU</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Unit 4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">8.3 lbs/MMBTU prior to October 1, 1989 \12\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Coal delivered to Tanners Creek after July 1, 1988, maynot exceed an SO<T2>2</T2> emission rate equivalent to an emission limit of 6.6 lbs/MMBTU.<ITAG tagnum="14">6.60 lbs/MMBTU, on or after October 1, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">5.24 lbs/MMBTU, on or after August 1, 1991</ITAG>(b) Schenley Distillers:<ITAG tagnum="16">Boilers 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">0.6 lbs/MMBTU</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Boilers 4, 5, 9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Restricted to natural gas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Boilers 6, 7, 8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">40 tons per year, combined</ITAG>(c) Seagrams and Sons:<ITAG tagnum="16">Boilers 5 and 6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">1.92 lbs/MMBtu, except Boiler 5 is limited to</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">1.07 lbs/MMBTU when Boiler 6 is bruning any fuel other than naturalgas</ITAG>(d) Diamond Thantcher Glass:<ITAG tagnum="16">Furnaces 1 and 2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">1.4 lbs/MMBTU</ITAG>The rule also specifies reporting requirements for Boilers 6, 7, 8 at Schenley's(for the tons per year limit) and Boilers 5 and 6 at Seagrams.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ USEPA believes that the alternative emission restrictionsin the rule for Seagrams and the annual limit for Schenleys necessitateadditional source records and data beyond that required by 325 IAC 7-1-3.1.Such additional records and data are required by the Dearborn County rule.The rule does not, however, specify the methods to be used to obtain thesedata or state whether they can be used to determine compliance. USEPA requestsclarification on these matters from the State during the comment period.Similar alternative emission limits exist in Lake and Porter Counties.See requirements for AMAIZO, AMOCO, Inland Steel, LTV Steel, MarbleheadLime, NIPSCO-Mitchell, and USX in Lake County and Bethlehem Steel and MidwestSteel in Porter County. The State should similarly clarify how it intendsto use its reporting requirements in these counties as well.<ITAG tagnum="28">In addition, there is no requirement within the Dearborn County rulefor advance notification to either the State or USEPA when Seagrams switchesbetween its two emission limit scenarios. Similarly, Inland Steel, NIPSCO-Mitchell,Stauffer Chemical, and USX in Lake County and Bethlehem Steel and MidwestSteel in Porter County have alternative emission scenarios. USEPA is consideringwhether such notification should be required. USEPA solicits comment onthe need for such notification and on the minimum time, if any, withinwhich notification should be required.</ITAG>USEPA accepts the final compliance date of August 1, 1991, for DearbornCounty sources. Dearborn county is currently designated as unclassifiablefor SO<T2>2</T2>. Section 110 of the Clean Air Act requires attainment of theprimary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 3 yearsfrom the date of approval of the plan, and attainment of the secondaryNAAQS within a reasonable time. USEPA believes that the State's final compliancedate is consistent with these requirements.As technical support for its revised emission limitations, the State hasperformed a new modeling analysis.\14\<NOTE/> Indiana used the ISCST model (rural, UNAMAP Version 6). ComplexI (UNAMAP Version 6) was also used in the VALLEY screening mode. USEPAbelieves that these are the appropriate guideline models for this situation.Dearborn County meteorological data were used, where available. Stack heightcredit at Cincinatti Gas and Electric Company's Miami Fort (a large powerplant in Ohio) and Tanners Creek was limited, based on the stack heightregulations (see discussion below). Based on a screening analysis, theworst-case operating loads were determined to be 50% at Miami Fort-Unit5, 75% at Thatcher Glass, and 100% at all other sources. Building downwashwas modeled for stacks at Miami Fort and Schenley with heights less than``good engineering practice (GEP) formula heights''. See the Stack HeightRegulations below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The modeling techniques used in the attainment demonstrationsfor Dearborn, Lake, and Porter Counties are based on the modeling guidelinesin place at the time the analyses were performed (i.e., ``Guideline onAir Quality Models (Revised)'', July 1986). Since that time, USEPA haspromulgated a revision to its modeling guidelines (i.e., January 6, 1988,publication of ``Supplement A to the Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)'',July 1987). Because the modeling was initiated prior to the latest revisionof the guidelines, USEPA accepts the analyses for Dearborn, Lake, and PorterCounties as they stand.Two refined analyses were performed by the Indiana Department of EnvironmentalManagement (IDEM). In the first analysis, Indiana sources were modeledat their allowable emission limits under the current State permits, andOhio sources were modeled at their allowable emission limits under thecurrent SIP. This modeling predicted many violations of the primary annual,primary 24-hour, and secondary 3-hour NAAQS in Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.The highest violations in all three States were due solely to two Ohiosources, Miami Fort, Units 5 and 6, and, to a lesser extent, a DuPont facility.Although Indiana sources significantly contributed to some lesser violations,these violations would still occur even if the impact from Indiana sourceswas eliminated. However, these violations in the three States would becorrected if the culpable Ohio sources reduced emissions sufficiently tocorrect the highest (constraining) violation. Because these two Ohio sourcescaused so many of the high concentrations listed in the model output tables,it was not possible to identify the critical concentrations affected byIndiana sources. Consequently, in order to develop a control strategy forIndiana sources, IDEM reduced the modeled emission rate for Miami Fort,Units 5 and 6, from 5.0 to 1.2 lbs/MMBTU in the second anaylsis.\15\<NOTE/> A discussion of the results of this analysis follow.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ IDEM modeled Unit 7 at its actual height and Unit 8 atthe height demonstrated to be Good Engineering Practice based on a recentfluid modeling study. The critical 3-hour concentration due to Indiana sources was 1584 microgramsper cubic meter (ug/m3) (versus the standard of 1300 ug/m3) and the critical24-hour concentration due to Indiana sources was 392 ug/m3 (versus thestandard of 365 ug/m3). To correct the 3-hour violation, it is necessaryto reduce the emissions at Tanners Creek, Unit 4 to 5.24 lbs/MMBTU. Tocorrect the 24-hour violation, it is necessary to reduce emissions fromSeagrams, Boilers 5 and 6.These emission limitations provide for attainment of the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS in Dearborn County, but for the impact of Ohio sources.USEPA believes that Section 110 of the Clean Air Act does not oblige adownwind State to tighten its SO<T2>2</T2> SIP, where an upwind State's emissions cause violations bothin the downwind State and within its own boundaries, and where the violationscan be eliminated only by further control in the upwind State. Given thatthe highest constraining violations are due to out-of-State sources, thatmost violations would occur even if the impact from Dearborn County sourceswere eliminated, and that those reductions in emissions from Hamilton Countysources which are estimated to be necessary to assure attainment in Ohiowould (when combined with Indian's plan for Dearborn County) also assureattainment in Dearborn County, USEPA believes that Indiana's plan is consistentwith the requirements of Section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Consequently,USEPA is proposing to approve the Dearborn County plan. USEPA will takewhatever action is necessary to deal with the modeled violations due toOhio sources.<ITAG tagnum="84">Lake County </ITAG>USEPA cited two major deficiencies with the SIP for Lake County in itsFebruary 4, 1987, proposed rulemaking: (1) the compliance test method wasinconsistent with the short-term SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS, and (2) the plan failed to ensure attainment of the primaryand secondary NAAQS (based on numerous technical deficiencies in the State'smodeling analysis). On October 21, 1987, the State submitted a revisedcompliance test method rule (325 IAC 7-1-3.1). On January 19, 1988, USEPAapproved this rule for all 92 counties in Indiana (see 53 FR 1354). Thus,this issue has been resolved. On August 15, 1988, the State submitted a revised rule, 326 IAC 7-1-8.1,for Lake County for parallel processing. (The previous SO<T2>2</T2> plan for Lake County was withdrawn on July 31, 1987.) The newrule imposes the following requirements:\16\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ All other sources in the county remain governed by the6.0 lbs/MMBTU emission limit in 325 IAC 7-1-2(b).

Portions of Lake County are currently designatedas nonattainment for SO<T2>2</T2>. Section 110 (and Part D) of the Clean Air Act requires attainmentof the primary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, and attainment ofthe secondary NAAQS within a reasonable time. USEPA believes the State'sDecember 30, 1991, final compliance date (which is 3 years from the dateof the plan's final approval, under the Consent Decree in <T3>Sierra Club</T3> v. <T3>Thomas</T3>, Civ. No. NA 86-194-C (S.D. Ind.)) is consistent with theserequirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Modeling Analysis </ITAG>As technical support for its revised emission limitations, the State hasperformed a new modeling analysis. Indiana used the ISCST model (urban,UNAMAP Version 6) to predict 3-hour and 24-hour concentrations. ISCLT (urban,UNAMAP Version 6) was used with a calibration equation to predict annualconcentrations. The urban version of the models was selected based on thepredominant urban land use types in the study area. Lake County meteorologicaldata were used where available. Sources were generally modeled using ISCSTat maximum emissions, except where the rule limits emissions below maximum.In addition, the State performed a limited analysis of lake-induced fumigationconditions using the Lyons-Cole model. Because the ISC results were moreconstraining, the Lyons-Cole results were not considered in setting emissionlimitations. USEPA finds Indiana's modeling acceptable and proposes toapprove Indiana's Lake County rule and plan. <ITAG tagnum="84">Porter County </ITAG>USEPA cited two major deficiencies with the SIP for Porter County in itsFebruary 4, 1987, proposed rulemaking: (1) the compliance test method wasinconsistent with the short-term SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS, and (2) the plan failed to ensure attainment of the primaryand secondary NAAQS (based on numerous technical deficiencies in the State'smodeling analysis). On October 21, 1987, the State submitted a revisedcompliance test method rule (325 IAC 7-1-3.1). On January 19, 1988, USEPAapproved this rule for all 92 counties in Indiana (see 53 FR 1354). Thus,this issue has been resolved. On August 15, 1988, the State submitted a revised rule, 326 IAC 7-1-21,for Porter County for parallel processing. (The previous SO<T2>2</T2> plan for Porter County was withdrawn on December 22, 1987.)The new rule's site-specific requirements are as follows: (1) Bethlehem Steel: (a) Certain boilers and furnaces are restricted to natural gas. (b) Stack-specific ``lbs/MMBTU'' and/or ``lbs/hour'' limits which allowsfuel oil to be used at the 80&quot; strip mill in exchange for reductions atother units. (c) Restrictions on the amount of coke oven gas that can be burned. (d) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements include daily fuel type usagein each facility, daily average sulfur content and heating value for eachfuel type, number of slab mill soaking pits burning coke oven gas eachday, and calculated daily lbs/MMBTU and lbs/hour value for each facility.The Company is also required to notify the State at least 24 hours priorto the use of fuel oil in the 80&quot; Mill furnaces.\1\\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Rule 326 IAC 7-1-21(a)(1)(C), as submitted, containsclerical errors in its numbering by containing two sets of subparagraphs(vi) and (vii); the second set of which are supposed to be numbered (xviii)and (xix). Additionally, in the second paragraph (vi), the rule actuallyapplies to the alternative set of limits specified in subparagraphs (i)through (xvii), as opposed to the (i) through (v) specified in the ruleas submitted. The State will correct these errors prior to USEPA's finalrulemaking on the regulation. (2) NIPSCO-Bailly: <ITAG tagnum="16">Boilers 7 and 8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">6.0 lbs/MMBTU </ITAG>(3) Midwest Steel: <ITAG tagnum="16">(a) Boilers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">1.33 lbs/MMBTU </ITAG>(b) Only 2 of 4 boilers may burn fuel oil greater than 0.3 lbs/MMTBU simultaneously.(c) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements (hourly fuel type burned ineach boiler). (4) Air Products: <ITAG tagnum="16">Boilers and Reformer </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Restricted to natural gas. </ITAG>USEPA proposes to approve Indiana's final compliance date of December 31,1988. Porter County is currently designated as unclassifiable for SO<T2>2</T2>. Section 110 of the Clean Air Act requires attainment of theprimary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 3 yearsfrom the date of approval of the plan, and attainment of the secondaryNAAQS within a reasonable time. USEPA believes the State's December 31,1988, final compliance date is consistent with these requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Modeling Analysis </ITAG>As technical support for its revised emission limitations, the State hasperformed a new modeling analysis. Indiana used ISCST model (rural, UNAMAPVersion 6). To support the use of the rural version of the model, two analyseswere performed: (a) A land use analysis consistent with USEPA's modeling guidelines, whichidentified more rural than urban land use types. (b) A limited model-monitor comparison study, using 1983-1986 emissions,meteorology, and air quality data. This indicated that ISC-urban tendsto overpredict 24-hour and generally 3-hour concentrations, while ISC-ruralappears to be more accurate, but tends to underestimate the peak (top 5)24-hour (by about 10%) and 3-hour (by about 60%) concentrations. Given the better performance of ISCST-rural and the rural nature of thearea, ISCST-rural was selected. To guard against the possible model underprediction,ambient data were used in developing emission limits. Based on a model-monitorcomparison study, the modeled 24-hour concentrations were increased by10%. The adjusted 24-hour modeled concentrations were then compared tothe 24-hour NAAQS. (Although the State did not perform any 3-hour adjustments,it should be noted that the highest, second high modeled 3-hour concentrationis 1014 ug/m3 before application of the emission reductions and the cokeoven gas ``caps'' noted above. These emission reductions are sufficientto protect the 3-hour SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS and generally produce 3-hour concentrations that are lessthan 60% of the 3-hour NAAQS.) Porter County meteorological data were used where available. All sourceswere modeled at maximum load, except where the rule limits the sourcesto less than maximum load. USEPA finds the modeling acceptable and proposesto approve Indiana's Porter County rule and plan. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Issues </ITAG>(A) Consistency with Stack Height Regulations USEPA's July 8, 1985, stack height regulations \1\\8\<NOTE/> apply to stacks (and sources) which came into existence,and dispersion techniques implemented on or after December 31, 1970. Stackheight credit for the purpose of establishing an emission limitation isgenerally restricted to GEP, i.e., the greater of 213 feet [65 meters (m)]or the GEP formula height (40 CFR 51.100(ii)). Credit for merged stacksis generally prohibited with the following four exceptions: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Certain provisions of these rules were remanded toUSEPA in <T3>NRDC</T3> v. <T3>Thomas</T3>, 838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). These are: grandfatheringstack height credits for sources who raise their stacks prior to October1, 1983, up to the height permitted by GEP formula height [40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2)];dispersion credit for sources originally designed an constructed with mergedor multi-flue stacks [40 CFR 51.100(hh)(22)(ii)(A)]; and grandfatheringcredit for the refined (H+1.5L) formula height for sources unable to showreliance on the original (2.5H) formula [40 CFR 51.100(ii)(2)]. (1) Where total plant wide allowable SO<T2>2</T2> emissions do not exceed 5000 tons per year, (2) Where the stack was originally designed and constructed with mergedgas streams, (3) Where such merging was before July 8, 1985, and was part of a changein operation that: (i) included the installation of emissions control equipmentor was carried out for sound economic or engineering reasons, and (ii)did not result in an increase in the emission limitation or (if no limitwas in existence prior to merging) in the actual emissions, or (4) Where such merging was after July 8, 1985, ans was part of a changein operation at the facility that includes the installation of pollutioncontrols and is accompanied by a net reduction in the allowable emissionsfor the pollutant affected by the change in operation. Indiana identified 3 stacks in Dearborn County, 64 stacks in Lake Countyand 11 stacks in Porter County that exceed 65m. Indiana certified thatall of these stacks were in existence prior to December 31, 1970 (and theirheights are, therefore, creditable under the regulation), except for 2stacks at Tanners Creek, 1 stack at Seagrams, 5 stacks at Bethlehem Steel,9 stacks at USX, and 9 stacks at Inland Steel. Twenty-three of these twenty-sixstacks were found to be less than applicable GEP formula height and are,therefore, creditable. The stacks serving Boiler andplusmin;8 at USX andBoilers 1,2,3 at Tanners Creek are greater than GEP. The State's attainmentdemonstrations properly modeled these stacks at GEP formula height. As to the twenty-sixth stack, IDEM documented that a 122m stack heightfor Tanners Creek, Unit 4 was in existence before December 31, 1970, andwas so modeled. Note, the actual pre-1970 stack was 168m, which was replacedwith a 122m stack in 1977. Thus, 122m is the proper stack height for modelingpurposes. Indiana identified one source in Dearborn County, seven sources in LakeCounty, and two sources in Porter County with SO<T2>2</T2> emissions greater than 5000 tons per year. In Porter County,one source (NIPSCo-Bailly) has a stack that was in existence before 1971,and the other source (Bethlehem Steel) has a separate stack for each unit.In Dearborn County, merged stack credit (i.e., single stack serving multipleunits) is an issue for only Tanners Creek, Units 1-3.\19\<NOTE/> Based on information provided by Indiana on December 2, 1985,and January 26, 1987, which showed that the merging was conducted in conjunctionwith the installation of pollution control equipment and that the emissionlimits do not represent an increase in emissions, USEPA believes that mergedstack credit is allowed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Note that total emissions for Schenley are less than5000 tons per year; thus, merged credit for Boilers 6-8 is allowed.In Lake County, two sources (ComEd-Stateline, NIPSCo-Mitchell) have stacksthat were in existence before 1971, two sources (AMOCO, Stauffer Chemical)have a separate stack for each unit, and three sources (USX, LTV Steel,and Inland Steel) have either a separate stack for each unit or stacksthat were in existence before 1971, with one exception. At Inland Steel,the three boilers in the No. 5 Boilerhouse were originally designed andconstructed in 1977 with a single stack. Because the exemptions noted abovehave been satisfied, there are no dispersion technique issues. In addition,USEPA believes that the nozzle for the stack serving Boilers 6 and 11 atNIPSCO is not a ``dispersion technique'' under Section 123 of the CleanAir Act, because it does not increase the final exhaust gas plume rise.USEPA is proposing to approve all of the above as meeting the requirementsof USEPA's July 8, 1985, stack height regulations. However for Inland Steel,the provision under which USEPA is proposing to approve credit has beenremanded to USEPA (i.e., original design and construction exemption formerged stacks.) Thus, these emission limits are subject to review and possiblerevision as a result of the remand in <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Thomas</T3>. If USEPA's response to the <T3>NRDC </T3>remand modifies the appliable July 8, 1985, regulations,then USEPA will notify the State whether the emission limit for InlandSteel must be re-examined for consistency with the modified regulations.USEPA's proposed approval for this facility's emission limits is intendedto avoid delay in the establishment of federally enforceable emission limitsfor all sources in Lake County, while awaiting resolution of the <T3>NRDC </T3>remand.(B) PSD Increment AnalysisUSEPA policy requires SIP relaxations submitted after June 19, 1978, tobe evaluated for increment consumption. Because the SIP revisions for Dearborn,Lake and Porter Counties represent a decrease, rather than an increasein emissions, an increment analysis is not required.(C) Interstate ImpactThere are two States (ILlinois and Michigan) within 50 km (the normal rangeof the current guideline models) of Lake and Porter Counties. The LakeCounty modeling demonstrated attainment at receptors located in Illinois.To address attainment in the other cases, the State is relying on theirdemonstration of attainment within each County, coupled with the inclusionof each County's impact in the other Country (via the monitored backgroundconcentrations) and a decreasing concentration gradient in the directionof the nearby State. Based on this information, USEPA believes that theplans for these two counties will not cause a violation of the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS in any other nearby State.As to Dearborn County, as stated above, emissions from sources in DearbornCounty under Indiana's revised plan will not cause violations either inOhio or Kentucky.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>USEPA proposes to approve Indiana's rules and the plans for Dearborn, Lake,and Porter Counties. This proposed approval specifically includes (1) thesource-specific emission limits and other requirements in Indiana's county-specificrules, and (2) the 6.0 lbs/MMBTU emission limit in 325 IAC 7-1-2 whichis applicable to all other sources not specifically listed in the county-specificrules (except the sources described by Footnote 3 and in Lake County).Under USEPA's parallel processing procedures, these county-specific rulesmust be fully state-adopted, enforceable, and submitted as a revision toIndiana's SO<T2>2</T2> SIP before USEPA can take final rulemaking action to approvethem.Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major''. The Officeof Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIPapprovals do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.
