We have measured the temperature dependence of electricalresistance from 1.5 to 300 K and the magnetoresitance at low temperture.In all samples, the temperature coefficient of resistivity becomes negativeand tends to be more negative with increasing the resistivity rho(300K)which depends upon the substrate temperature during deposition. The uppercritical field H/sub c2/(T) for superconducting samples was greatly enhancedover that of crystalline Nb films.</TEXT></DOC>
