The claim came soon after Vietnam said its last troops hadpulled out of Cambodia, where they fought the guerrillas for morethan a decade. The battle is now being waged by soldiers of thegovernment Vietnam installed.   Also today, a Vietnam News Agency report monitored in Bangkok,Thailand, said Cambodia's government in Phnom Penh plans to holdgeneral elections at the end of the year whether or not a politicalsolution to the insurgency is found.   A spokesman for the Khmer People's National Liberation Front,Abdulgaffar Peang-Meth, said 5,000 guerrilla fighters attacked fivetowns and other positions along Highway 69, which parallelsCambodia's western border.   Gen. Dien Del, acting commander of the front, said his fightersknocked out tanks, overran 10 army positions flanking the highwayand seized a district capital, Thmar Puok. The Vietnamese army leftthat town six days ago.   At the town of Banteay Chmar, which Dien Del said was alsoseized, the front captured a warehouse with 1,000 weapons, he said.   Dien Del said the attackers sustained light casualties andinflicted heavy losses on Cambodia's forces, estimated at 4,500soldiers. He said one Soviet-built T-54 tank was destroyed, twodisabled and a fourth captured.   His claims could not be independently verified.   ``Our intention is to test the strength of the government ofPresident Heng Samrin and force Phnom Penh to the negotiatingtable,'' the general said.   A Western diplomat said that if true, the fall of Thmar Puokwould be a ``major victory'' for the front.   A Western relief official based in the border town ofAranyaprathet said heavy shelling could be heard near the keyborder town from early morning.   He said the front's vast refugee camp of Site 2, 30 miles to thenorth, was closed to relief workers for fear of possibleretaliation by government gunners. Site 2 is the largest camp onthe border, housing 140,000 people.   ``We will know more in the next couple of days,'' the reliefofficial said. ``At the moment it is difficult to judge how much istrue and how much is propaganda.'' He spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The general also discussed the assault on Sisophon, located atthe junction of highways 69 and 5 and at the southern end of the38-mile-long and 10-to-25-mile deep area the front says it isattacking.   He said Sisophon was listed as among the five major objectivesof the offensive and was attacked for ``psychological warfarereasons.''   He said there would be no attempt to capture it. Earlier, frontofficers said their troops had already entered Sisophon. Thenorthernmost town is Banteay Chmar. The other targeted towns areSvey Chiek and Kandoun.   The diplomat said the front may have timed the push with drivesby its guerrilla coalition partners _ the communist Khmer Rouge anda group loyal to resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk _ inother areas along the Thai-Cambodian border.   The front claims to have 16,000 fighters. The strongestguerrilla group, the Khmer Rouge, fields up to 40,000, according toWestern estimates.   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge inlate 1978, said it completed withdrawal of its troops on Tuesday.But the guerrillas say thousands of Vietnamese have stayed behind.   Some diplomats say the poorly trained and equipped Cambodianarmy may not be able to beat back the guerrillas without Vietnamesesupport.   The Khmer Rouge has recently claimed a series of battlesuccesses against Cambodian army units, which they say weresupported by Vietnamese troops.</TEXT></DOC>
