TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Defense Ministry today quoted a ShiiteMoslem clergyman as saying that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.Higgins may have been alive last week, contrary to reports he waskilled months ago.   An Israeli official said the clergyman, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid,may be given lie detector tests to help establish when Higgins died.   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group, the Organization of theOppressed on Earth, claimed it hanged Higgins on Monday inretaliation for Israel's refusal to free Obeid, who was kidnappedby Israeli commandos July 28.   Higgins was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, in south Lebanon.   Despite Obeid's statements about Higgins, Israel officially saysit received word months ago that Higgins had been killed.   An Israeli official said that during the interrogation, Obeidgave the impression that he was ``afraid'' to be extradited to theUnited States.   Obeid has been isolated since his capture and has no knowledgeof reports Higgins has been hanged to avenge his abduction.   Some Israeli officials claim Obeid was a ``central figure'' inthe Iranian-backed Hezbollah, an umbrella for factions holdingforeign hostages that also is believed to have provided support forattacks and car bombings. But other sources in Israel and Lebanonminimize his importance, describing him more as a religious leaderor a ``cheerleader.''   A statement released today by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin'sspokesman, Eitan Haber, said ``in his interrogation, Sheik Obeidstated that while he personally has no information concerning Col.Higgins' condition, he heard through hearsay that Col. Higgins isalive.''   It said Obeid told Israeli interrogators Higgins arrived inBeirut shortly after he was kidnapped last year and was in goodcondition. ``I am in no position to know what happened to him ormight have happened to him afterward,'' it quoted Obeid as saying.   The statement quoted Defense Ministry sources as saying theywanted to ``emphasize and reiterate that in accordance with theinformation presently available to them, Col. Higgins was put todeath in Beirut already at the end of 1988 but that the ministryhas no definite confirmation of this.''   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saidIsrael believes Higgins died as a result of ``mistreatment andtorture'' and that there is ``strong evidence'' he died more than ayear ago.   An Israeli official, asking not to be identified, said Obeid mayundergo a polygraph test to determine exactly what he knows. Theofficial said Israel believes Obeid is not telling all he knowsabout the Marine's fate.   Higgins, 44, of Lexington, Ky., was part of a U.N. observerforce in Lebanon when he was abducted. His captors accused him ofspying.   After the July 1988 shooting down of an Iranian jetliner by aU.S. warship in the Persian Gulf, the kidnappers announced thatHiggins had been sentenced to death.   Israel said it captured Obeid in an effort to use the cleric tofree three missing Israel soldiers in Lebanon. It has offered toexchange him and other Shiite captives for three captured Israelisoldiers in Lebanon and the foreign hostages in Lebanon. Hezbollahrejected a swap.</TEXT></DOC>
