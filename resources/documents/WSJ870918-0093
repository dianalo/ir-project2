GarciaStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   It's like being a vegetarian at a barbecue, or a teetotaler at a wine-tasting. That's how it feels to invest in a high-priced market when you buy only stocks with low price-earnings ratios.    &quot;It's lonely out here,&quot; says John B. Neff, portfolio manager of the Windsor Fund, a mutual fund that specializes in stocks with relatively low P-E ratios. &quot;We're trying to keep our heads while others seem intent on losing theirs.&quot;    To investors like Mr. Neff, a low P-E ratio, calculated by dividing a stock's current price by the company's annual per-share earnings, is proof of good value. Some of these so-called value investors strictly limit how high a stock's P-E ratio can go before it's out of their orbit. Others will push their P-E ceilings higher as the ratio of the whole market climbs. Neither group relishes the current market.    Since 1979, the P-E ratio of Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index has jumped 153%, to 18.42, its highest level since the go-go era of the early 1960s. Even bulls get nervous when P-E multiples approach the stratosphere; low P-E investors often get squeezed out of the market.    Mr. Neff has salvaged something from this bull market by investing in a few groups, like the autos, that have relatively low P-E ratios. But his fund is only 79% invested now, as he awaits impending doom. &quot;You've got interest rates increasing, you have an economic expansion that's mature, we're going to have a recession at some point, and we may even get a Democratic administration,&quot; he says.    As the market P-E ratio rises, low P-E investors tend to find themselves with more cash and less stock. This year, having any cash at all has meant underperforming the big market indices. Scott Black, president and founder of Delphi Management Inc. in Boston, is only 83% invested, and as he sells stock, he finds fewer issues that meet his criteria.    &quot;This is the worst market for value I've seen since I've been a money manager,&quot; says Mr. Black, who has eight years of experience. He won't buy any stock with a P-E ratio above nine. &quot;But we don't chase stocks, we don't bend our discipline,&quot; he says. &quot;If you do that, then you're playing the stock market instead of being a value investor.&quot;    Like Mr. Neff, Mr. Black senses calamity ahead. &quot;Ultimately, speculation gets corrected,&quot; he says. &quot;We're not going to get clobbered&quot; on such companies as Merck andamp; Co. or Liz Claiborne Inc. &quot;When stocks like those roll over, they go fast.&quot;    Chris Najork, senior vice president and trust officer of First Republic Bank in Dallas, vividly recalls when a group of high P-E stocks known as the Nifty Fifty collapsed in the early 1970s. Mr. Najork, who had been a Nifty Fifty enthusiast, became a low P-E convert. But Mr. Najork's approach is more flexible than some of his colleagues'. As the P-E level of the market rises, so does his portfolio's, staying at about 70% of the market level.    Even so, Mr. Najork acknowledges that finding good value in today's market brings to mind needles and haystacks. He has stayed almost fully invested by concentrating on interest-sensitive and financial service stocks, such as savings and loans, banks, property and casualty insurers and electric, telephone and gas utilities. That has let him participate in a bull market shunned by absolute low P-E investors. But if the market starts falling, Mr. Najork realizes he's vulnerable. &quot;We're pretty nervous right here,&quot; he says.    A market fueled not by investors seeking value but by excess liquidity makes life even harder for low P-E investors, says James H. Farrell, a partner in Cashman Farrell andamp; Associates, a money management firm in Wayne, Pa. As the whole market climbs, low P-E investors are left with the few groups, like the financial services, whose P-E ratios usually lag behind the market's. Some of those stocks have done poorly in recent months, bringing more grief to low P-E investors.    &quot;We got hurt pretty bad with the financial stocks,&quot; says Ernie Kiehne, senior vice president of Legg Mason Inc. He has shifted about 10% of his portfolio into the European markets, where, he says, P-E ratios are averaging nine or 10.    Low P-E investors tend to take the long view, and they cherish safety. Michael Price, president of Mutual Fund Shares, recently sold ConAgra Inc. because he considered its P-E ratio of 11 too high. Like other low P-E investors, Mr. Price says he doesn't mind sacrificing some advance in stock prices to protect principal. &quot;I get so many letters from shareholders telling me how well they sleep at night,&quot; Mr. Price says. &quot;Every morning I come in looking to sell something. It's not what I can buy but what I can sell.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
