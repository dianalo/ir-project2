Police later found the body of another man, apparently anattacker killed when police fired back.   No one claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, butpolice Col. Juan Carlos Salgado called it the work of``extremists.'' The term is used here to refer to two bands ofurban guerrillas organized years ago to fight the past militaryregime of Gen. Augusto Ponochet.   Four young gunmen sprayed the bus with gunfire during Friday'sattack in La Florida, a working-class district in southernSantiago. The police bus was hit by at least 40 shots.   The pickup, reported stolen hours earlier, sped away immediatelyafter the attack, witnesses said.   Police said they found the truck abandoned two hours later about20 blocks away with the body of a man, apparently an attacker, deadof gunshot wounds in the back seat. Police said the man, in hislate 20s, was wearing a wig.   In addition to the two slain officers, two policemen and twocivilians were wounded, authorities said.   Similar attacks were common during Pinochet's 16{-year rule. Butthey had virtually ceased after Pinochet was succeeded March 11 byPresident Patricio Aylwin, an elected civilian.   The attack came hours after the government announced it isincreasing the 30,000-member National Police force by 4,500.</TEXT></DOC>
