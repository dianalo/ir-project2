The most violence directed against those trying to preserve humanrights during the past year came in the 3-year-old democracy of thePhilippines, while the Soviet Union showed some of the greatestprogress in support of human rights, said the 217-page reportreleased Tuesday by Human Rights Watch.   The report for 1988 documented 750 cases of persecution againstpeople monitoring human rights in 61 countries, including 30killings or deaths under detention, three disappearances and 16killings of people associated with human rights monitors. The numberof deaths was more than triple that found in the first such surveylast year, but officials said the higher figures reflect increasedhuman rights activity rather than increased repression.   ``The country which unfortunately looms largest in terms ofviolence to human rights monitors is the Philippines,'' said AryehNeier, Human Rights Watch executive director, at a news conference.   Nine of the deaths and two of the disappearances were in thePhilippines. Columbia led a similar survey last year as the mostdangerous country for pursuing human rights.   Neier said President Corazon Aquino's overthrow of 20-year rulerFerdinand Marcos in February 1986 brought hope for change, but newcivilian governments often are ``either too weak or lack thepolitical will'' to protect their people against abuses by themilitary and other forces.   ``The largest number of cases do not take place in dictatorshipsof either the right or the left who seem able to maintain controlwithout resorting to extreme forms of violence against human rightsmonitors,'' Neier said.   Other countries with elected civilian governments and serioushuman rights problems include Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador,Guatemala, Honduras, Peru and Sri Lanka, said Neier, director of thegroup which includes Americas Watch, Asia Watch and Helsinki Watch.It also is setting up Africa Watch and Middle East Watch to documentand combat human rights abuses in those regions.   In both years covered by the group, the largest number ofpersecutions _ not necessarily leading to death _ were in SouthAfrica, Chile, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, the report said.   The report said Israel, which was not included in last year'sreport, made the 1988 survey because of ``the efforts of the Israeliauthorities to suppress information about human rights abuses in thecontext of the uprising in the Occupied Territories.''   However, Neier cautioned that the number of reported incidentsagainst human rights workers in any country cannot be used as anindex of general repression, because many countries are toorepressive to allow any monitoring. He listed North Korea, SaudiArabia, Iraq, Albania and Ethiopia as countries where human rightsworkers cannot operate.   Much of this year's section on the Soviet Union dealt withreleases of human rights monitors from detention, rather than withpersecution. But Neier said he did not consider any country heroicsimply because it did not abuse people working to protect humanrights.   ``The only heroes are the human rights monitors,'' he said.   In its first report last year, the group counted 10 deaths andtwo disappearances related to human rights work throughout theworld. Five other deaths were discovered later and added to the 1987totals.   Neier said abuse cases increased primarily because human rightsmonitoring has increased and spread into rural areas.   Increased abuses were reported in Cuba primarily because ofincreased international attention to human rights in the islandnation, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
