Next door, middle-aged managers explore &quot;just-in-time&quot; strategies for resupplying inventories. Across the hall, clerical workers learn techniques to increase their typing speed.    This broad spectrum of courses, offered here at Motorola Inc.'s Training and Educational Center (dubbed M-TEC by employees), illustrates the widening scope of corporate education programs.    While lecterns in company offices are nothing new, their primary purpose has long been to foster corporate culture and provide job-specific training for new workers. Now, however, businesses are spending billions of dollars to establish and operate in-house &quot;corporate colleges.&quot; Free of charge to employees, these education programs offer curricula ranging from basic classes in math, writing and science to advanced-degree courses in business and technology. Typically, the teachers are company managers or independent consultants.    Such programs are growing so rapidly that &quot;they soon could exceed the size of the nation's university system,&quot; contends Nell Eurich, an educational consultant at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Ms. Eurich estimates that U.S. companies are currently spending upward of $40 billion a year to deliver education to about 8 million workers. In contrast, the four-year colleges and universities in the U.S. spend some $60 billion annually to educate about the same number of students, she says.    Consider the program at Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. Throughout most of the insurance company's 80-year history, employee instruction consisted mainly of &quot;teaching new recruits how to process insurance claims and underwrite policies,&quot; says William Zeigler, director of management training there.    But in 1984, the Hartford, Conn.-based company built the Aetna Institute for Corporate Education, at a cost of $42 million. The eight-story building includes a 269-room hotel for visiting students, a cafeteria and a computerized library. Course offerings range from word processing to advanced management training for fast-track executives. Aetna says it handles about 31,000 students a year, with an average daily enrollment of 650.    Recently, the institute added a basic-business-skills curriculum designed to retrain lower-level workers for jobs slightly higher up the corporate ladder. The new program, which includes courses in remedial reading, oral communications and writing, has also allowed Aetna to hire employees with little formal education -- people it wouldn't otherwise consider. This, in turn, has helped the company cope with labor shortages that have sharply reduced the number of potential job candidates.    Educational consultants estimate that close to 100 companies -- Eastman Kodak Co., Westinghouse Electric Co. and NCR Corp. among them -- offer in-house course work that can lead to academically accredited degrees. Some of these degree programs are made available through the several new satellite-age correspondence schools.    One of the largest of the satellite schools, National Technical University in Fort Collins, Colo., broadcasts live and videotaped lectures from some 24 universities, including Arizona State and Purdue. Corporate subscribers pay about $1,500 a semester for each employee enrolled, and participants rack up credits toward master's-level or doctoral degrees in computer science or engineering. NTU expects more than 1,200 students at 90 sites to enroll this fall, up from about 200 in 1984, the network's first year.    More than a dozen companies have gone as far as to offer brand-name degrees, such as the Arthur D. Little M.S. in Management (from Arthur D. Little Inc.) and the Rand Graduate Institute Ph.D. in Policy Analysis (from Rand Corp.).    The motives behind the education efforts are varied. Motorola's M-TEC, for example, is in part a response to rapidly changing technology, which has created a work force whose skills often are outdated. A maker of electronic products, Motorola says it spent two years retooling its mechanical engineers -- whose skills are less vital to a growing high-techonology company -- for jobs as electrical engineers.    Motorola also feels it must supplement the skills of entry-level workers who &quot;have nowhere near the mathematical competence of our Japanese competitors,&quot; says Edward W. Bales, director of operations at M-TEC. Mr. Bales cites a recent study by the federally funded International Association for the Evaluation of Education Achievement, which found, among other things, that elementary-school pupils in Japan had reached the same level of math competence as junior-high-school students in the U.S.    &quot;It has become a big issue,&quot; Mr. Bales says, &quot;because we don't think we can gain the competitive edge unless our workers are better educated.&quot; (Such sentiments prompted Motorola to set aside 2.5% of its annual payroll budget -- about $40 million -- to finance its training and educational activities.)    BellSouth Corp. says its accredited education program is a response to the lack of comparable degree programs elsewhere. &quot;Colleges do not have the expertise or equipment&quot; to teach certain telecommunications courses, asserts Milton Hasty, assistant director of educational services at the Atlanta-based telephone company. &quot;In some technical areas, the equipment that must be used is so new that it isn't available at the college or university level.&quot;    BellSouth recently opened the program to the public. Outsiders' tuition for the mostly undergraduate-level courses, which take from a day to three weeks to complete, ranges between $150 and $200 a day. Average daily enrollment overall, the company says, is 1,000 students.    While educators generally praise the companies with programs for taking a more active interest in their workers, some members of academia are critical of the trend.    &quot;The trouble is that companies are not coordinating their efforts&quot; with traditional schools, contends the Carnegie Foundation's Ms. Eurich. While she concedes that the traditional schools are often &quot;a little out of touch&quot; with the needs of business, she maintains that collaboration would make for a better use of cash and resources. &quot;It's a waste of money to have companies duplicating the efforts of schools and colleges,&quot; she says.    Like many other academics, Ms. Eurich also asserts that corporate education programs too often operate in isolation, without reference to concerns beyond the company. Because of this, she says, corporate-college students aren't likely to achieve the kind of insight and understanding that can result when more varied groups interact in a classroom.    On the other hand, however, there are those who argue that schools should recognize the corporate programs as symptomatic of an underlying problem. &quot;We have to ask ourselves, 'Why can they deliver in three weekends the same course that it takes us 14 weeks to teach?'&quot; says Ernest Lynton, a senior associate at the University of Massachusetts' McCormack Institute. &quot;The real issue is that we must be much less rigid.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
