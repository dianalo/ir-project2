The Roman Catholic leader, at the start of a 10-day tour ofsouthern Africa, also urged the people of the region to renounceviolence.   ``Powerful political, economic and ideological forces endangerthe still fragile stability of countries which are only beginningto consolidate their recently acquired independence,'' the popesaid in an arrival speech. ``Those forces impede theself-determination of peoples, they foment ideological, ethnic andtribal conflicts, they delay the process of development.''   The pope did not mention any country by name, but he said hiscomments were ``true for the grave issue of apartheid,'' SouthAfrica's policy of racial segregation. He told journalistsaccompanying him on the papal flight from Rome that apartheid was``a racist ideology.''   Hundreds of Zimbabweans cheered wildly as the pope appeared atthe door of his Air Alitalia Boeing 747, descended a stairway andkneeled to kiss the soil in his traditional arrival gesture.   Later, thousands of waving and cheering people stood along thepope's motorcade route from Harare International Airport todowntown.   At the airport, President Robert Mugabe, one of the nearly 1million Catholics in this country of 8.5 million people, waited atthe edge of a red carpet to greet the pope.   Traditional dancers and church choirs gave John Paul a festivewelcome to start his 39th tour abroad and fourth visit to Africasince he became head of the Roman Catholic Church 10 years ago.   The pope's three-day trip to Zimbabwe is the first stop on thehis five-nation tour of southern Africa, his first visit to thepolitically troubled region. The other countries he will visit areBotswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique.   The five countries are among the youngest in Africa, and8-year-old Zimbabwe is the youngest. The southern states opposewhite-led South Africa's racial segregation policy, but must dependon the economically and militarily powerful neighbor for economicsurvival.   The Pretoria government asked John Paul to include South Africaon his current tour, but the invitation was rejected.   Even though he is avoiding South Africa, the tour is expected tobe one of the most politically charged trips by John Paul, the mostwidely-traveled pope in history.   Speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him to Zimbabwe,the former white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia, the 68-year-oldpontiff expressed hope that a future papal trip to South Africawould trigger changes. But he said no date had been set for such atrip.   He also stopped short of endorsing an American sanctions billthat mandates disinvestment by U.S. companies from South Africa anda near-total trade embargo.   After his Zimbabwe speech, John Paul told bishops from theregion, gathered at a Dominican convent, that he prayed every dayfor the release of Mandela.   Mandela, the 70-year-old leader of the African NationalCongress, has refused to sign a statement renouncing use ofviolence as a condition for his release from South Africandetention.   ``I ask for his freedom every day ... It must take place ... Iam full of admiration for him. I am proud of his firmness,'' hesaid.   The ANC is the major guerrilla group fighting the South Africangovernment.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no votein national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   The pope also told the bishops that ``only a negotiatedsettlement of differences can bring true peace and justice'' inSouth Africa.   ``A loss of confidence in the possibility of a peaceful solutioncould easily lead to further frustration and violence, increasingthe threat to peace, not limited to this region,'' he said.   He endorsed the U.S.-mediated regional peace talks betweenAngola, Cuba and South Africa that seek the departure of 50,000Cubans from Angola and have led to the withdrawal of South Africantroops involved in the 13-year-long civil war.   The talks also seek to bring independence to South-West Africa,known as Namibia.</TEXT></DOC>
