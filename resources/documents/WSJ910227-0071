The union, whose membership has authorized a strike, if itshould come to that, began last December to negotiatein-plant issues endemic to the four UAW locals operatingunder the labor agreement. Now, the scene shifts to theso-called main table, where pay, benefits and other corematters are hammered out. Those discussions will be held inPalm Springs.</LP><TEXT>   The current contract runs through March 17 and covers some23,000 union members. About 85% of those work in Long Beach,where McDonnell Douglas performs the final assembly of itsMD-80 and MD-11 commercial jetliners, and builds the C-17military cargo plane. Smaller feeder factories in Oklahomaand Arkansas also are affected.   Richard Rios, president of UAW Local 148 here, said hewill be looking to revise the system by which factory-floorgroup leaders are picked, reduce mandatory overtime, and havea three-year contract replace the current five-year accord.   He said the union, whose members currently average about$15.50 an hour, will also pursue &quot;a substantial wageincrease,&quot; despite McDonnell Douglas's tenuous financialposition. Mr. Rios said he would &quot;want to do no worse&quot; thanthe best of the contracts signed by the Machinists union inits last round of aerospace-industry bargaining.   That would be the pact reached at cash-rich Boeing Co.,where the Machinists walked out for 48 days in the fall of1989 before winning base wage gains of 4% in the first yearand 3% in each of the following two years, plus annualbonuses of 10%, 5% and 4%, respectively.   But other Machinists -- at Lockheed Corp., GeneralDynamics Corp. and McDonnell Douglas's jet-fighter plant inSt. Louis -- didn't make out as well. Neither did a smallcontingent of Machinists at Long Beach, who agreed to a 5.5%wage rise in the first year of their contract, and 3%increases the next two years. In addition, they securedone-time lump-sum bonuses of 4% a year.   There is little reason to believe the UAW can do muchbetter, given that McDonnell Douglas is saddled with $3billion in debt. But this also may not be the year for thecompany to play hardball with the union, which staged a17-week strike here in 1983. The company declined to discussits bargaining goals.   McDonnell Douglas has just started to deliver the MD-11,and it's counting on the $100 million airplane to help reviveits fortunes. &quot;I may be naive, but the possibility of astrike this year is not something I'm really worrying about,&quot;said Joe Pirkle, general manager of the jetliner program,which has encountered a few start-up glitches. &quot;I thinkeverybody knows this isn't a good time for any of us to havea prolonged disruption.&quot;   The C-17 is also at a critical juncture. The company is inthe midst of negotiations with the Air Force over paymentsand scheduling. Among other issues, they must figure out howto keep the C-17 production line going while using thelimited funding Congress has provided this year.   With the C-17's first flight scheduled for this summer, astrike could be crippling. &quot;You won't see us cheering, that'sfor sure,&quot; said Col. Charles Seifert, assistant programdirector for the Air Force. &quot;This is the pivotal year to getthe plane up and flying.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
