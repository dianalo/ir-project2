Steinberg, known around Wall Street as a financier, a corporate raider and a greenmailer, now would like to be known as an insurance man.    &quot;From nothing, we've built one of the largest insurance service companies in the U.S.,&quot; says Mr. Steinberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Reliance Group Holdings Inc., which also has interests in real estate and consulting services -- as well as major stockholdings in a number of companies. &quot;But there's a lot of noise about, 'You filed a 13D on this company' or 'You made an investment in that company.'&quot;    While viewing himself as an insurance man, the 47-year-old Mr. Steinberg is no less decisive, shrewd and sometimes ruthless than he has been as a corporate raider. He says he won't &quot;stand on the sidelines and let managements diminish shareholder value. We'll do what we have to do to protect our investments.&quot;    On Friday, Mr. Steinberg showed how that's done. The board of Frank B. Hall andamp; Co., an insurance brokerage firm in which Mr. Steinberg has a 49.4% stake, elected Mr. Steinberg chairman and chief executive of the company, replacing John F. McCaffrey. Despite his other activities, Mr. Steinberg says he will spend a &quot;considerable&quot; amount of time running Hall.    Indeed, Hall may take up a considerable amount of Mr. Steinberg's time. Earlier last week, the company had reported a net loss of $2.2 million for the second quarter and a 46% decline in first-half earnings, to $5.6 million. Hall said Mr. McCaffrey's resignation was prompted by &quot;differences of opinion concerning how to improve the financial performance of the company.&quot;    Reliance, on the other hand, will post improved second-quarter earnings tomorrow. It expects to report that net income jumped to more than $37.5 million, or more than 50 cents a share, on revenue of about $840 million. In last year's second quarter, net was $7.9 million on revenue of $840.3 million. After payment of preferred stock dividends, there were no per-share earnings last year.    Mr. Steinberg attributes the improvement partly to some &quot;disciplines&quot; he says were put into effect four or five years ago. &quot;We measure each profit center down to the specific underwriter, and his record stays with him,&quot; Mr. Steinberg says. &quot;We don't interfere, so the managers can get on with their jobs. And we give very good incentives -- but only for good results.&quot;    Mr. Steinberg is perhaps best known for his stock-buying raids on companies like Walt Disney Productions, Tiger International Inc. and Quaker State Oil Refining Corp. But of the $3.2 billion in Reliance revenue last year, the vast majority -- $2.4 billion -- came from insurance premiums. By comparison, only $658 million came from investment income and gains on sales of investments.    Despite Reliance's steadily improving earnings, its stock price has remained almost flat since a public offering of 15 million shares late last year. That's a source of some frustration to Mr. Steinberg, who, with his family and senior management, owns about 81% of the 75 million shares outstanding. (In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, the stock rose 62.5 cents to $10.50.)    The timing of the public offering &quot;was rather bad,&quot; says Mr. Steinberg. &quot;At the time we filed, the whole sentiment on Wall Street was turning away from property and casualty companies.&quot;    As a result, Mr. Steinberg says, few analysts follow his company. &quot;The analysts just didn't want to add another name to what they were following,&quot; he says. &quot;And our company is a little more complicated than others.&quot; Still, Mr. Steinberg says, &quot;It's very unusual for a company of our size to have so few analysts.&quot;    Mr. Steinberg knows that some people perceive him as a man who buys into a company, makes a quick, easy dollar and then gets out. That's wrong, he says. &quot;What we do is very hard investing,&quot; he says. &quot;We go into troubled situations and turn them around. You don't see results for two or three years, and then suddenly you look like a genius. But you have to be willing to look like a bum for awhile before you can look like a genius.&quot;    In his quest to be seen as a man at the helm of a successful insurance company, Mr. Steinberg plays down possible acquisitions -- but he doesn't rule them out, either. &quot;We have no plans on the horizon to do acquisitions of any kind,&quot; he says. &quot;That doesn't mean if something comes up that looks awfully cheap or fits our long-term plan that we wouldn't do it. We are opportunistic here.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
