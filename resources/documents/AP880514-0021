Walsh says theJustice Department has the final word on whether certain classifiedmaterial can be used in the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North andthree co-defendants.   That concession could enable the department to scuttle theprosecution of the fired National Security Council aide, formernational security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealersRichard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.   In a legal memorandum filed in the case, Walsh said he ``must bedeferential to the executive's determination as to whether nationalsecurity concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classifiedinformation.''   Walsh has amassed 50,000 classified government documents thatmay be relevant to the prosecution of charges that Hakim, North,Poindexter and Secord conspired to illegally divert to theNicaraguan Contra rebels the profits from sales of U.S. arms toIran.   Another 250,000 secret documents may contain informationrelevant to the defense of the case.   By Walsh's description, the most sensitive 5 percent to 10percent of the documents contain secrets about U.S. intelligenceand military operations and sensitive foreign policy initiatives.   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), theattorney general must certify to the court that disclosure ofcertain documents as evidence in court would endanger nationalsecurity. The law provides for substitution of summaries of thedocuments or statements of what the evidence would prove ifrevealed in open court.   The court has the power to dismiss criminal cases if too muchevidence is withheld.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has warned that he woulddismiss charges if relevant secret documents are not declassifiedfor use at the trial as evidence.   Gesell also has expressed an unwillingness to spend a lot oftime rewriting classified documents so that they could be presentedas evidence in a public trial.   He has given Walsh until June 10 to submit a list of documentsthe independent counsel wants to use as prosecution evidence thatwon't be declassified.   The legal memorandum from Walsh to Gesell was filed in responseto a question about the issue that the judge posed during a May 6hearing.   Walsh said: ``It is an inherent function of the executive branchto maintain the confidentiality of sensitive national securityinformation to the extent necessary to permit the government toconduct its foreign affairs and national defense activitieseffectively.   ``Neither the independent counsel statute nor the regulationpurports to confer upon independent counsel any general power ofdeclassification.''   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who has been questionedrepeatedly by the Iran-Contra grand jury about his November 1986investigation of the arms-for-hostages deals, has recused himselffrom the case, or any others involving independent counsels.   Any decision about classified information in the Iran-Contracase would have to be made by an acting attorney general.   Walsh said that under a 1982 executive order on classifieddocuments, he has no authority to declassify government secrets andmust therefore defer to the authority of the attorney general.   Walsh said he agreed to comply with the 1982 executive orderwhen he obtained the 300,000 pages of classified documents in thecourse of his investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
