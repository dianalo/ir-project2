 There's no room for systemerrors, lost data or downtime.andM;Confidence in OS/2's system reliability allowed Merrill Lynch Canada Inc. inToronto to choose a PC-based network for its new trading-floor system insteadof a minicomputer or mainframe.andP;  &quot;It's a mission-critical application in thecontext of an investment dealer,&quot; said Bob Jull, president of Linkage Inc. ofToronto, the software house that built the system for Merrill Lynch.andM;&quot;Traditionally, PCs and LANs have not been robust enough to support this kindof mission-critical system,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In this class of applications,trading has been done on a non-stop platform, because you can't afford tohave the system fail.&quot;andM;The Toronto trading floor handles institutional trades of money-marketinstruments such as municipal bonds and Treasury bills.andP;  Clients includelarge insurance firms and banks around the world.andP;  Transactions are verylarge, usually in the multimillion-dollar range, and time is short -- anentire municipal-bond issue can be sold off in hours.andM;&quot;Trading has always been done on the back of an envelope,&quot; Jull said.andO;&quot;[Traders] yell their trades to everybody and keep a blotter on their deskwith significant trades, and they write them on a big board.&quot;andM;That's why the Presentation Manager (PM) graphical interface is a criticalpart of the new OS/2 application, which provides daily statements of profitand loss.andP;  It also allows real-time updates on inventory -- what instrumentshave been sold and what remain to be sold.andM;&quot;After the flurry's all over, you've got to go back and see what happened andwhat your inventory position is,&quot; said Jull.andM;The new system is a client/server architecture built around Microsoft Corp.'sOS/2 LAN Manager with PM as the graphical interface.andM;The project was developed in two phases: The server side was implemented inOctober, and the client side is currently in final testing.andP;  The servers --two 16MHz IBM PS/2 Model 80s -- contain the inventory of trades, which wasorganized using the Ashton-Tate/Microsoft version of SQL Server.andM;This first phase used the OS/2 server and a DOS client in a batch system thatprovided inventory reports and daily profit-and-loss statements.andP;  Clerksmanually entered all of the transactions at the end of each day, and thereports were produced overnight.andM;The second phase puts PM on line on the client side and features real-timeinventory updates.andM;A trader using a mouse or keyboard picks an item off an inventory-summaryscreen, which automatically brings up a trade-entry screen.andP;  If all otherfields, such as asking price, have not changed, all the trader needs to do isenter the quantity.andP;  This updates the inventory in real time to reflect thetrade, and broadcasts it on the fly to the other traders.andM;&quot;A trader is talking to five or 10 people at a time, watching the Dow Jonesor Reuters screen -- there's a million things going on at once,&quot; Jull said.andO;&quot;So they don't want to have anything to do with computers and trades unlessit's easy.&quot;andM;An easy-to-use interface with a quick response time was crucial to theproject's success, said Anna Ewing, assistant vice president of informationsystems at Merrill Lynch.andP;  So far the traders' response has been &quot;verypositive and very intuitive,&quot; said Ewing, who managed the project.andP;  &quot;They'relearning it without a user guide.&quot;andM;2-Year PaybackandM;Implementing the system on PCs has made sound economic sense for thefinancial-services company: Jull estimated that the PC LAN cost about half asmuch as a comparable mainframe or mini version; Ewing pegged the paybackperiod at two years.andM;&quot;In spite of the overruns associated with the risks and delays in productavailability, we were able to achieve the requirements on a verycost-effective platform,&quot; said Ewing.andP;  &quot;With the Model 80 as a server, you'reusing a platform that encourages end-user computing.andP;  That's when the valuewill prove itself -- when the users will be able to take the data and runwith it.&quot;andM;&quot;What we've seen up till now is [minicomputer] Unix platforms that are veryexpensive, but this application is so critical it has justified those highexpenses,&quot; Jull said.andP;  &quot;OS/2 is letting us install a lower-cost alternativeto that.&quot;andM;SQL Server provided a high-performance database-management system that wasnot previously available in a PC LAN platform, Jull said.andP;  It allows data tobe mirrored (written and maintained on two distinct servers), so that if oneserver fails, the other is there as a backup.andM;&quot;If the operating system wasn't stable, this application could never be areality,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;There's no tolerance for failure in a system like this.&quot;andM;&quot;We were taking a risk with OS/2&quot; because of &quot;the very uncharted and immaturemarket,&quot; Ewing said.andM;&quot;You're not calling a standard hot line -- you're calling a systems engineerwho worked on the program,&quot; she explained, adding that she frequently had towait for questions to be researched before they could be answered.andP;  &quot;It's alot more stressful, in that the onus is on you to solve the problem,&quot; shesaid.andM;For Ewing, the biggest post-implementation issue is maintaining the skilllevel of her staff.andP;  &quot;The challenge is to cultivate and maintain the OS/2pioneers,&quot; she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
