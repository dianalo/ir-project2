A team of California scientists reported it hadtransplanted to mice a human gene for a protein that is a keypart of the so-called HDL form of cholesterol. The mice withhigh levels of the human protein and of HDL cholesterolcirculating in their bloodstreams were far more resistant todeveloping the fatty deposits in their arteries thanidentical mice without the human gene, according to theresearchers' report in this week's issue of the journalNature.</LP><TEXT>   Until now, the idea that high levels of the HDL (whichstands for high-density lipoprotein) form of cholesterol wereprotective against heart disease has been based almost whollyon circumstantial evidence from humans. Various populationstudies have shown that people with high HDL-cholesterollevels have fewer heart attacks than people with low levelsof HDL-cholesterol. Such studies, while suggestive, fallshort of proving cause-and-effect.   The new experiment is among the first to use mice to studythe development of atherosclerosis, the clogging of thearteries with fatty deposits that can lead ultimately to aheart attack. It was long thought that the high-fat,high-cholesterol diets that induce artery-clogging in humansand monkeys were too toxic for mice and that the rodentswouldn't live long enough to develop atherosclerosis. As aresult, researchers have rarely used mice in research on thedisease.   It was discovered in the mid-1980s, however, thatartery-clogging could be induced in certain strains of inbredmice by slight changes in the makeup of the high-fat diet. Asa result, heart disease researchers are starting to takeadvantage of the fact that thousands of genetically identicalanimals can be produced in a short time by inbreeding. Thenew experiment, which couldn't be done in humans or monkeys,was carried out in a group of genetically identical mice bygeneticist Edward M. Ruber and his colleagues at theUniversity of California's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.   The researchers took the human gene for a protein calledApo A-1 and inserted the gene into mouse embryos. Apo A-1 isa protein that wraps around tiny packets of cholesterol toform HDL cholesterol. The resulting &quot;transgenic&quot; mice hadlevels of both the Apo A-1 protein and of the HDL form ofcholesterol in their bloodstreams that were about twice ashigh as in &quot;control&quot; mice that were identical in every wayexcept they lacked the human Apo A-1 gene.   The mice were fed the high-fat diets that, althoughdifferent from the human diet, were known to induce the sameresults, that is, clogging of the arteries. The mice with thehuman gene had far fewer fatty, yellow streaks in theirarteries than control mice. The fatty streaks are the firststages of artery-clogging.   The results, the researchers said, show that the Apo A-1protein inhibits the early development of atherosclerosis, atleast in mice. Longer-term experiments will have to be doneto gauge Apo A-1's effects on the late stages of the disease,the researchers said.</TEXT></DOC>
