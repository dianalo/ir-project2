But your overall emphasis and tone contradict thatstatement. Many (if not most) branches of Goddess worshipinclude a male deity and stress love and understandingbetween the sexes. My personal experience is of a roughlyequal number of men and women who participate; the men arenot wimps and the women are not bitches.   Some rituals and services in Goddess worship are designedto let go of things that hold us back from our full humanpotential and they may seem peculiar to those not familiarwith Goddess worship. You made almost no mention of thereverence for nature, the acknowledgment of both female andmale energies in life, and the fulfillment for humanpotential that truly make up Goddess worship as we know ittoday.</LP><TEXT>   Laura von Bosau   Boston   ---   Shame on you for your patronizing and superficial articleabout Goddess worshipers. I suppose if you went to aChristian church, you would tell of a cannibalistic deathcult (referring to its practice of communion and thecrucifixes adorning church walls and worshipers' necks).   Although you did touch on one of our basic beliefs -- thatall life is interconnected and that we strive for harmonybetween all life on earth -- you failed to report how this isrelated to our rituals, thus trivializing them. You also buyinto mainstream culture's &quot;war between the sexes&quot; when youattempt to pit the men's spirituality movement against thewomens's.   Most of us are working for a new kind of partnershipbetween women and men in which each is honored and respected.Honor and respect are the last things present when womentreat men as success objects and men treat women as sexobjects. A lot of healing and relearning will have to happento overcome thousands of years of dominator/manipulatorculture.   Callista Lee   Long Beach Woman Spirit   Lakewood, Calif.   ---   Your article reflected the patronization of women by theestablishment that we are trying to combat. The womenportrayed (all of whom took some other name, as if playingmake-believe) are shown as &quot;giggling,&quot; primal screamingman-haters.   I do not use an alias, and I take my religion seriously.This includes laughing and dancing and a sense of humor notportrayed in your article. I do not worship on Groundhog Day,but on Imbolc, the eve of February.   Erica Friedman   Morristown, N.J.   ---   A prehistoric, Goddess-centered culture has now beendescribed, marked by egalitarianism (not woman-dominance),nurturing and focus on life-giving rather than life-taking.   The overthrow and subsequent attempts at revival of thatnonviolent culture are a valuable part of this Goddessscholarship. Dynamics between dominating forces vs.equalizing/nurturing forces are presented as a useful toolfor the study of history and current events.   I must confess that the religion and ritual of Goddessculture do little for me; but the scholarship associated withan ancient history too long obscured from our view may shed avaluable, hope-rekindling light on the human condition. Wecould use it.   David Schoenbach   Seattle   ---   The laws and the national social philosophy of thiscountry are based on the Judeo-Christian tradition.   In that religious tradition, the First Commandment refersto one true God: &quot;I am the Lord, thy God; thou shalt not havestrange gods before Me.&quot;   The Bible is full of terrible, historical events, whichresulted in the collective spiritual judgments on the Jewishand Christian peoples because of their worship of false gods.
