During theuncertain 1990s the richest countries may not get muchricher, but the poorest countries will almost certainly getpoorer.   That's the general conclusion emerging from a 11-dayUnited Nations conference, ending today, on the specialproblems of the world's 41 poorest nations, home to 420million people. The conference will issue a report callingfor rich countries to give the poor more aid, and for poorcountries to spend that aid more wisely. A similar conferencehere in 1981 issued a similar report, called the SubstantialNew Program of Action. It was largely ignored, and things gotworse.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We represent despair,&quot; says A.H.G. Mohiuddin,Bangladesh's ambassador to the U.N. &quot;Our situation has onlydeteriorated.&quot;   That deterioration is likely to continue. The UnitedNations estimates that oil price rises connected with thePersian Gulf crisis could add more than $1 billion to the oilbill of the poorest countries this year and next. The U.N.had figured that these countries, already saddled with $70billion in foreign debt, would need extra aid inflows of $11billion by 1995 to get them started on the path to recovery.The U.N. says an oil price of $25 a barrel increases thatfigure to more than $14 billion. For the poorest countries toreach a decent growth rate of 5% a year, they would need aidfrom the rich totaling $36 billion a year, triple what theyreceived last year.   The poor countries claim, with some justification, thatthe rich countries haven't kept their promises. The 1981program called for generous debt rescheduling or forgiveness,only some of which has happened, and called for richcountries to devote 0.15% of their gross national product tohelp the poorest countries. While some European countrieshave done so, the U.S. and Japan have fallen well short, andthe total reached only 0.09%, right where it was in 1981. TheU.N. says that if everyone had met the 0.15% target, the poorcountries would have been $40 billion better off between 1982and 1988.   The poor were also hit hard by two big oil price increasesand the collapse in price of most basic commodities, oftentheir only source of export income. During recessions, richcountries tended to make it hard for poor countries to selltheir products: The poorest countries' share of world tradein manufactured goods dropped to 0.3% from 1.3% during the1980s.   The rich countries claim, also with some justification,that aid to poor countries is often wasted by non-democraticgovernments. Leading industrial countries wanted strongpledges from the poor countries that they would move morequickly toward democracy. &quot;What we've learned over the pastdecade,&quot; says Stephane Hessel, a former French ambassador whohelped organize the 1981 conference, &quot;is that democracy isthe essential element in development. The lesson of the 1990sis that democracy isn't the luxury of the rich. Rather, theabsence of democracy is a luxury that poor countries can nolonger afford.&quot;   But despite the sweep of democracy through Eastern Europe,the poor countries still bristle at such suggestions.Nigerian delegate Alhaji Abubakar Abdulkadir suggested thatthe East-West cold war was being replaced by a North-Southbattle. Indeed, just before he spoke on Wednesday theconference was disrupted by an unseemly quarrel between theIraqi delegate and the delegate from the exiled government ofKuwait, which the United Nations still recognizes as thelegitimate government there. The Iraqi delegate pointed outthat the $2.5 billion the U.S. was spending every month ontroops in Saudi Arabia would be better spent on poorcountries. The delegate from the United Arab Emiratesresponded acidly that development aid &quot;doesn't necessarilymean you have to occupy another country.&quot;   Delegates were still arguing last night over language inthe final report concerning political responsibilities. Therich industrialized countries want the report to single outas the best target for development &quot;the individual . . .which thus entails respect for and promotion of all humanrights,&quot; and add that development only works where there is&quot;democratic consensus.&quot;   The poor countries have countered with language sayingthat they all will &quot;select . . . their own model ofdevelopment and ownership of means of production,&quot; and willregard any political advice as strictly optional.   U.N. officials were working on a compromise on thislanguage, and said they were confident they could alsoinclude specific pledges of more aid in the final document.But they also recall that the 1981 report had plenty ofpledges.   &quot;We thought things would get a lot better after 1981 andthey got worse,&quot; says Yves Berthelot, deputysecretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development. &quot;It is simply not acceptable that one-tenthof the world's population continue to be marginalized.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
