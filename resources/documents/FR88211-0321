The U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to protect and enhance approximately30,000 acres of strategically located wooded wetlands, consisting of bottomlandhardwood forests and swamps with high waterfowl value in Halifax, Bertie,and Martin Counties, North Carolina. The environmental assessment (assessment)considers the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects of protectingand preserving 30,000 acres of wooded wetlands for the benefit of migratingand wintering black ducks, mallards, and wood ducks; for wood duck production;and for protection and development of striped bass habitat. Secondary objectiveswould include protection and management for other wetland wildlife species,management for compatible public uses, forestry, and research. Five alternativesfor protection of the area are discussed in the assessment. These rangefrom ``No Action'' to ``Combined Fish and Wildlife Service/North CarolinaWildlife Resources Commission Acquisition and Management.'' The PreferredAlternative is ``Fee Acquisition and Management by the Service.'' The assessment is available upon request, and comments from the publicare invited. Two public meetings will be held to hear views from the publicand are scheduled as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">February 17, 1988, 7:30 p.m., Williamston High School Auditorium,200 Godwin Avenue, Williamston, North Carolina </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">February 18, 1988, 7:30 p.m., Athens Drive High School Auditorium,1420 Athens Drive, Raleigh, North Carolina</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The assessment will be available to the public on February8, 1988.

The primary purpose of the proposal is to providewetland habitat for the benefit of migrating and wintering black ducks,mallards, and wood ducks; for wood duck production; and for the developmentof striped bass habitat. Secondary objectives of the proposed action wouldinclude protection and management for other wetland wildlife species andcompatible public uses, forestry practices, and research.The proposed project area is located in the middle portion of the RoanokeRiver. Not only does this area contain the most productive wetlands, butalso has the widest variety of tree species. The floodplain contains pocketsof swamp (near permanently flooded areas) that support tupelo gum and cypressstands. Here are found the bottomlands or alluvial ridges that containoak, ash, maple, hickory, yellow poplar, hackberry, sugarberry, sycamore,persimmon, elm, buckeye, cottonwood, black gum, and sweet gum trees. The Service considered the following five alternatives for the preservationof habitat in the Roanoke River floodplain: <T3>Alternative 1: </T3>No Action; <T3>Alternative 2: </T3>Acquisition of Conservation Easements by Fish andWildlife Service; <T3>Alternative 3: </T3>Acquisition/Management by Others; <T3>Alternative 4: </T3>Fee Acquisition and Management by Fish and WildlifeService (Preferred Alternative); and <T3>Alternative 5: </T3>Combined Fish and Wildlife Service/North CarolinaWildlife Resources Commission Acquisition and Management. All alternatives were considered in light of the degree of resource protectionand enhancement offered, the ability to effectively manage the area, theenvironmental consequences, the costs involved, and the consistency withService land acquisition policy. The alternatives are briefly described below: <T3>Alternative 1. No Action_</T3>In this ``status quo'' alternative, theService would rely on existing local, State, and Federal regulatory bodiesto protect the resource and its habitat. If this alternative is selected,the primary vegetation in bottomlands would slowly continue to be alteredby clearing of vegetation on the higher elevations, drainage, and conversionto additional croplands, pasturelands, or sweet gum/sycamore plantations.<T3>Alternative 2: Acquisition of Conservation Easements by Fish and WildlifeService_</T3>Under this alternative the Service would acquire the righton designated project lands to prevent certain uses that would be detrimentalto waterfowl use. The Service could prevent designated harmful uses butotherwise could not engage in management on the property. <T3>Alternative 3: Acquisition/Management by Others_</T3>Under this alternativethe Service would not acquire nor manage the land but would rely on anotherentity to do so. The purpose for which the land was purchased would dictatethe impact that it would have on future vegetative cover, wildlife populations,hydrology, and socioeconomics. <T3>Alternative 4: Fee Acquisition and Management by the Fish and WildlifeService (Preferred Alternative)_</T3>Under this alternative, the Servicewould acquire fee title to key tracts totaling approximately 30,000 acresfor inclusion within the National Wildlife Refuge System. Where feasible,management by habitat improvement would be practiced in order to provideoptimum carrying capacity with emphasis on black ducks, mallards, woodducks, and striped bass. This alternative would benefit the entire rangeof environmental components to the greatest degree. <T3>Alternative 5: Combined Fish and Wildlife Service/North Carolina WildlifeResources Commission Acquisition and Management_</T3>Under this alternative,the Fish and Wildlife Service, and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commissionwould identify and either jointly or separately acquire and manage approximately30,000 acres of Roanoke River bottomlands and swamps. The various habitat,wildlife, and water management methods described in the preceding sectionwould also be practiced under this alternative. Service personnel and representatives from North Carolina Wildlife ResourcesCommission and The Nature Conservancy held several meetings to gather informationfor this assessment. Commission personnel support Service involvement inthe Roanoke basin as well as the Service's acquisition of lands adjacentto their holdings. <ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
