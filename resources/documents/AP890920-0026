The London-based human rights organization said it has documentedat least 1,600 legally sanctioned executions worldwide during thefirst eight months of this year but believes the true number to bemuch higher.   Amnesty International has long opposed the death penalty, callingit a cruel and unusual punishment inflicted disproportionately onthe poor, ethnic minorities and political opponents.   It released a study of capital punishment worldwide in April,urging 100 countries to wipe it off their lawbooks. Today, theorganization said it was renewing its appeal to six countriesbecause a change in their practices could ``turn the tide ofstate-sanctioned killings.''   Amnesty also announced that its branches in 46 countries wouldlobby embassies of the six governments during the next week, sendingthem hundreds of telex, telephone and facsimile messages.   Amnesty said 13 people have been executed this year in the UnitedStates and 37 in South Africa.   It said at least one person is known to have been executed in theSoviet Union and five are awaiting imminent execution after losingtheir appeals for clemency. It said the Soviet Union has refused topublish statistics on executions for more than 50 years.   Precise figures are also difficult to obtain from Iraq because ofgovernment secrecy, but Amnesty said hundreds are reported to havebeen executed there this year. In Iran, there have been at least1,200 executions in the same time period, more than half fordrug-related offenses, it said.   Amnesty said that of 242 people known to have been executed inChina this year, 137 were killed after the army's bloody crackdownon the pro-democracy movement June 3-4 and included people accusedof involvement in the protests.   It reiterated earlier concerns that the total of Chineseexecutions was much higher.   Amnesty said it was ``gravely concerned'' by legal and politicaldevelopments regarding the death penalty in several countries in thelast year.   It singled out a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that theexecution of juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded does notviolate the constitution, adding:   ``Since the ruling was handed down at least one U.S. prisonerbelieved to be mentally retarded has been executed. Horace Dunkins,aged 28, was electrocuted in the state of Alabama on July 14. Thefirst jolt of electricity failed to kill him, reportedly because theelectric chair had been wired incorrectly. He was only declared dead19 minutes after the lever was first pulled.''   On South Africa, Amnesty cited the death sentence imposed on 14men and women in May in connection with the killing of a policeofficer.   It said 13 of the defendants were found only to have thrownstones at the officer's house after security forces broke up aprotest meeting near the town of Upington, but were convicted ofsharing a ``common purpose'' in the murder.   This month, the chief justice of South Africa's Supreme Courtsaid 13 of the 14 could appeal both conviction and sentence, and theother could appeal the sentence.   Amnesty said that since April, one country, Cambodia, hasannounced its decision to abolish capital punishment.   Moves for abolition are under way in several other countries, itsaid, including Italy, where lawmakers called in August for thedeath penalty to be removed from the country's military penal code,and Switzerland where moves have been made in parliament to abolishthe death penalty for all offenses.   In Ireland, two political parties in the governing coalitionproposed in mid-July to abolish capital punishment; in Jamaica 10prisoners had their death sentences annulled in March and July, someafter having been on death row for 11 years; and in Hungary, thedeath penalty was abolished for crimes against the state in June.</TEXT></DOC>
