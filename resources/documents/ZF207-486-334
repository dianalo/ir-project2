 In 1988, American Cyanamid racked up $4.6 billion insales, and had a net earnings of $306 million.andP;  It currently employs about35,000 people worldwide.andM;When networking computers in such a corporation, difficulties abound.andP;  Quitenaturally, there is a wide variety of data processing equipment, mostlyincompatible.andP;  Huge pieces of equipment can't be thrown out just because MISdecides to network.andP;  At American Cyanamid, computer manufacturers includeApple, ATandamp;T, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Unisys and Wang.andP;  EvenPCs, when taken together, represent a substantial dollar investment.andP;  Not theleast of the problems faced in networking a new company is user resistance.andO;An effective network has to provide not only error-free connectivity, it hasto do it transparently and intuitively.andM;At American CyanamidandM;Although the heart of American Cyanamid is firmly located in the northeastcorridor of the United States, it has corporate tentacles all over the globe.andO;Headquartered in New Jersey, its network spans the United States and Canada.andM;There is a wide variety of data processing equipment at Cyanamid.andP;  Theresearch and commercial centers use both minicomputers and mainframes.andP;  Thereare mainframes at the manufacturing sites, as well as LANs (both proprietaryand open architecture) for general office use.andP;  There is also alaptop-toting, travelling sales force.andP;  According to Joe Kascik, manager ofnetwork planning, at Cyanamid's Computer/Communications Services, the goal innetworking the company was not only to give all users access to all thecompany resources but also to make that access as transparent and economicalas possible.andM;The research centers primarily use Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packardminicomputers, and in many cases the Digital computers are networked withDECnet.andP;  Many manufacturing plants and distribution centers have IBM System3/X, HP 3000 and Unisys hosts, all capable of emulating the IBM mainframe.andO;There are Starlan, Token Ring and Ethernet networks, as well as proprietaryLANs such as WangNet and FastLAN from Wang Laboratories.andM;Global NetworkingandM;Cyanamid connects all these disparate systems with the Information SystemNetwork (ISN) from ATandamp;T via LAN servers.andP;  The ISN is ATandamp;T's campus-wide,packet-switching network, as opposed to its enterprise-wide packet switch,Datakit.andP;  The distinction of the ISN as exclusively a premises-basednetworking product can be misleading, however.andP;  Cyanamid uses the ISN tonetwork its sites on two continents.andM;The ISN is composed of a central switching node, the Packet Controller, and aseries of Concentrators located with end user stations.andP;  There is an ISNnetwork packet controller for each building on a campus.andP;  The packetcontrollers on an individual campus are connected to each other by opticalfiber.andP;  Between premises, they are connected by trunk lines.andP;  Trunk lineslink concentrators via leased common carrier data channels.andM;There are 12 packet controllers or nodes on the Cyanamid backbone, one ateach site except Pearl River, which has five.andP;  There are also two in PuertoRico which are connected to each other and to the US via trunk lines.andP;  Thecontrollers in Pearl River are connected via fiber.andP;  Fiber provides veryclean transmission and has no known vulnerability.andP;  In some locations,they're running fiber in steam trenches.andP;  Fiber's large capacity is also aboon for Cyanamid.andP;  Since the traffic is not even close to filling thebandwidth, growth will be easy and painless.andM;Cyanamid runs a satellite link from New Jersey to Gosport, England.andO;According to John Wolosz, senior corporate communications analyst atCyanamid, the 64K-bits-per-second satellite link carries both voice and data.andO;Voice traffic is multiplexed over six channels.andP;  Data from the Wang systemtravels between the two sites in a 4.8K-bits-per-second channel.andP;  The IBMprocessor in New Jersey and the IBM processor in England communicate via a9.6K-bits-per-second channel.andM;Cyanamid uses a large number of T-1 lines, both virtual and dedicated, on itsmerged voice and data network.andP;  There are 52 destinations on the voice side,although voice and data share the T-1 lines.andP;  Those employees who are notdirectly connected to the Cyanamid network can dial into it using an 800-SDNExpress number.andP;  The service costs on the average 14 cents a minute.andP;  Oncelogged onto the Cyanamid network, a user can then take advantage of the modempools at any of several locations and dial out to any processor on thenetwork as well as outside services, provided he or she has the appropriatesecurity clearance.andM;The ISN, SpecificallyandM;The packet controller of the ISN is about 72 inches high and looks like arefrigerator.andP;  It can have up to 2,000 physical ports, and each controllercan support a maximum of 2,500 virtual circuits.andP;  The aggregate dataswitching speed is 8.64M bits per second.andP;  Access is controlled both at thecontroller and concentrator through &quot;perfect scheduling,&quot; a techniquepatented by ATandamp;T's Bell Laboratories.andP;  According to ATandamp;T, this methodprovides both the immediate access available with contention access methods(such as CSMA/CD) and the guaranteed access available with deterministicaccess methods (such as token passing).andM;The concentrators extend the short central bus of the packet controller usingfiber or conventional twisted pair.andP;  A concentrator is essentially astatistical multiplexer which can be rack mounted or vertically mounted in acloset.andP;  It contains a control module called a Concentrator Common Module(CCOM) and a power supply.andP;  It also contains up to five device interfacemodules, accommodating all except the Fiber Interface Module (FIM) and theTrunk Interface Module (TIM).andP;  The concentrator is linked by fiber to the FIMin the controller, providing up to 512 logical channels.andM;If equipped with the maximum of five Asynchronous Interface Modules (AIMs),the concentrator can connect up to 40 async devices to the controller.andP;  Theterminal data is multiplexed onto the optical fiber.andP;  The CCOM interfacesbetween the concentrator and the devices hooked to it.andP;  It also contains aclock that keeps the concentrator synchronized with the packet controller.andO;It routes packets from the controller to the appropriate interface module inthe concentrator.andM;ATandamp;T's Premises Distribution System (PDS) defines the wiring scheme for theISN.andP;  Generally, unshielded twisted pair connects the stations to theconcentrators and optical fiber runs between the concentrator and thecontroller.andP;  Fiber also connects the controllers between buildings on acampus.andP;  Stations can also be connected directly to the controller withtwisted pair.andP;  The fiber link is limited to three kilometers between theconcentrator and the controller, but it can be expanded up to 16 kilometersusing repeaters.andP;  The limit on twisted pair is 400 feet.andM;The various hosts and networks are interfaced to one another through the ISN.andO;Each network or processor is connected to the concentrator through a deviceinterface module.andP;  These modules allow the network to be easily customized,since they can be removed and inserted without bringing any part of thenetwork down.andP;  This is essential for network configuration and management.andM;AIMs connect asynchronous devices to the ISN.andP;  Asynchronous Data Units (ADUs)are used when devices are 150 to 200 feet away from the ISN.andP;  A packetcontroller can support up to 56 AIMs.andP;  The AIM assembles data from asyncdevices into packets, implements the proper protocols and holds the packetsin buffers while it waits to switch them.andP;  In reverse, it takes the packetsthat come from the switch, stores them in buffers, disassembles the packetstring and sends it to the appropriate destination.andM;The Synchronous Interface Modules (SIMs) connect synchronous IBM hosts andcluster controllers using the BSC and SDLC protocols.andP;  The two ports can beconfigured separately either for BSC or SDLC.andP;  Each port requires 11 RS-232leads.andM;Cyanamid's Ethernet networks are bridged to the ISN through Ethernet BridgeInterface Modules (EBIMs).andP;  EBIMs provide a Data Link layer inter-connectionbetween stations on different Ethernet segments which are connected to thesame packet controller, or at least to networked packet controllers.andP;  Thedevices have to be running either XNS, TCP/IP or ATandamp;T's 3BNet, since themodule does no protocol conversion above the Data Link level.andP;  Terminalsconnected through an AIM can access devices on an Ethernet segment.andP;  The datais switched through the AIM to a terminal server on the Ethernet segment.andM;Today, terminals talk to the hosts on the ISN at 19.2K bits per second.andO;Kascik says that Cyanamid intends to expand that in the future, and are evenlooking at ISN in Europe.andP;  The ISN supports the European T carrier interface,which runs at 2.048M bits per second.andP;  (The American T-1 standard is 1.544Mbits per second.)andP;  Eventually, Cyanamid hopes to upgrade to FDDI speed, whichis 100M-bits-per-second transmission over dual, counter-rotating, fiber opticrings.andM;The Starlan Interface Module Bridge (SLIM-B) does exactly what the EBIM does,except it interconnects Starlan networks with devices running either TCP/IPor MS-Net.andP;  The Starlan Interface Module Connection (SLIM-C) providesterminal emulation for PCs on Starlan which access hosts on the ISN.andP;  Itsupports up to 124 virtual circuits when installed in a controller and 64circuits in a concentrator.andM;Up to 16 Fiber Interface Modules (FIMs) can be installed in the packetcontroller.andP;  Each FIM has one port that supports multiple simultaneousvirtual circuits.andP;  The FIM receives and transmits data that travels overfiber between the controller and concentrator or between two controllers.andO;The Trunk Interface Module (TIM) connects controllers beyond the threekilometer fiber limit and supports trunk speeds between 9.6K and 1.544M bitsper second.andM;Terminals can access the ISN through modem pools.andP;  The modems provide dial-inand dial-out access between the network and remote terminals, hosts andprinters.andM;Transparency is EssentialandM;The medical division, centered at the Lederle Laboratories, uses the networkalmost purely for research, developing pharmaceutical compounds and so on,with a little electronic mail (E-mail) thrown in.andP;  The agricultural divisiondoes its own compound development, and also uses the network for E-mail andmaterials resource planning (MRP).andP;  On the chemical side, the system is usedprimarily for E-mail and terminal connections.andP;  The accounting, legal andpersonnel departments also use the network for their specific businesses.andO;International connections access the system for Wang data processing as wellas E-mail.andM;Despite the complexity, Cyanamid's worldwide network makes host accesstransparent to the user.andP;  &quot;All you have to do is hot button and dial to enterwhatever associated process you have clearance for,&quot; says Wolosz.andP;  &quot;Forexample, we might have HP 2000s numbered one through four listed on a menu.andO;Depending on which number the user selects, he could be transferred to aprocessor in Connecticut or Puerto Rico.&quot;andP;  Some stations can even supportdual processes.andP;  A user can select one process, put it on hold, selectanother, then hot key between the two.andM;All in all the network has been a boon to data processing.andP;  They don't haveto have multiple terminals to access multiple processes or applications.andO;They're attempting to get it down to one terminal per type of person, nomatter what terminal they're using or what process they have to attach to.andM;Cyanamid also conducts classes for all personnel to make them feel at ease.andO;The data communications courses are intended to educate people outside ofdata processing or information services.andP;  They start on a low level and getas techie as they need.andP;  The &quot;students&quot; learn how to use the network, but notnecessarily how it works.andP;  &quot;We're trying to educate management people, thelawyers, the librarians in the research labs, the people in personnel and soon.andP;  We're trying to make it as truly transparent to users as possible,&quot; saysKascik.andM;Management IssuesandM;Cyanamid's whole ISN network is managed by two people, neither of whom is asharried as you might think.andP;  &quot;In the three years we've had the network, we'veonly lost five port cards.andP;  That means only hostterminals have failed.andP;  Sincethey're universal cards, all the manager has to do is swap a card in and theterminal is running again.&quot;andP;  The average port connection is in the $300 to$400 range, which is less than any other LAN connection costs.andM;In such an extensive network, security is paramount.andP;  ISN security featuresallow network access restrictions and call restrictions, which can be enabledor disabled separately, over switched virtual circuits.andP;  Access depends onsign-ons, passwords and device addresses.andP;  A maximum of 2,500 logicalconnections and 2,000 physical assignments per node is allowed.andP;  Eachconnected device can belong to a maximum of 16 physical calling groups (PCGs)and each user can belong to a maximum of 16 logical calling groups (LCGs).andO;Generally, users belong to an average of seven PCGs and LCGs because ofstorage constraints.andM;When the network is as critical as it is at Cyanamid, downtime must beminimal.andP;  Should a link go down somewhere, the data is rerouted to anothersystem connected to the ISN through an Automatic Call Routing Capability.andO;The system manager can define trunk groups to provide this capability in caseof blocking and trunk or node failure at the time of call setup.andP;  Oncealternate routing is set up, the user only has to know the end point addresson the network.andP;  The user can then access any device for which he or she hasthe appropriate security clearance.andP;  When a link fails, the users' menus arenot automatically updated to reflect a failed link, so the menu doesn'tnecessarily list all available options.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
