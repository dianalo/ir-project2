DonaldandM;A software utility called Memory Master ($49.95; Vericomp, P.O. Box 23360,San Die , CA 92123; (800) 876-0400, (619) 277-0400) has a module called EDOSthat can give you an additional 96K of conventional memory, provided that youhave a 256K EGA or VGA card.andP;  EDOS is an application loader, which means yourapplication is a parameter for the EDOS command.andM;To use EDOS, you must reconfigure your applications for CGA graphics.andP;  Whenyou load an application with EDOS, it confiscates memory addresses A0000through B8000 (96K is normally used by EGA or VGA video), yielding 736K ofcontiguous conventional memory.andP;  In your case, this means that you can runSPSS Graphics and get printer output, but you won't be able to displaygraphics onscreen unless you turn off EDOS.andM;If you don't have the required video board setup but do happen to have a LIM4.0 board that can map EMS memory into video memory addresses (Intel's AboveBoards don't), the EEMRAM  module will do the same as EDOS.andM;Another program that can remap video memory, but only if your system has aChips and Technologies NEAT chip set and IMB RAM or a hardware-capable LIM4.0 board with 256K, is called Move'em ($89; Qualitas Inc., 7101 WisconsinAve., #1386, Bethesda, MD 20814; (301) 9076700).andM;THREE-FIGURE 3-DandM;I am looking for a low-end 3-D CADD package that has dimensioning, texthanding, solid modeling capabilities such as Bezier or spline curves, hiddenline removal, the ability to export drawings for use in Pagemaker 3.0, and arelatively friendly user interface.andP;  The package should also be able to runon my AT clone, which has an 80287 math coprocessor and 1MB of RAM.andM;W.S.andP;  ColwellandM;Delta, British ColumbiaandM;CanadaandM;DesignCAD 3D, Version 2.1 ($399; American Small Business Computers Inc., 327South Mill St., Pryor, OK 74361; (918) 825-4844) seems to meet your criteria,and you should have no problem running it on your system.andP;  it can use yourmath coprocessor, and although it will run with 1 MB of RAM, you may want toconsider adding more memory (to use as expanded memory, which the programsupports) if you're going to be creating large or very complex images.andM;DesignCAD 3D can't do Bezier curves, but it does do cubic splines.andP;  Andalthough it doesn't directly write DTP-ready files, the program comes with autility that will convert your files to IGES, GEM, or Postscript format.andM;SCAN IN, FAX OUTandM;I am considering the purchase of a fax board or machine.andP;  I use WordPerfectona 286-based system and need a unit compatible with the program.andP;  If someonesends me a hand-written fax, will the board be able to receive it and convertit to typed text? What are the pros and cons for a fax board versus a faxmachine?andM;I also need to buy a scanner.andP;  I'd like to start with a hand scanner that canscan both text and graphics.andP;  Eventually, I would like to upgrade to afull-page scanner specifically for text.andP;  Is there a hand scanner that I canstart with,then later graduate to a full-page scanner that will use the samesoftware? If not, which brands are my best alternatives?andM;Monica D. KulesaandM;Carlstadt, New JerseyandM;Go directly to your collection of PC magazine back issues (or local library)and read the story &quot;PC to Paper: Fax Grows Up&quot; (April 11, 1989) The articleanswers your question about the advantages and pitfalls of fax boards and faxmachines and reviews 15 fax boards.andM;Then, check out The Complete Fax/ 9600 ($899; The Complete PC, 521 CottonwoodDr., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 434-0145), a Group III fax board with a portfor The Complete Hand Scanner/400 ($249), The Complete Half Page Scanner/ 400($299), or The Complete Page Scanner ($899); it gives you the softwareconsistency and upgrade path you desire, as well as saving a slot in yourmachine.andP;  The CFAX can work with other popular scanners as well, but then youneed to use that scanner's adapter board.andP;  When you read the article, keep inmind that the CFAX didn't have the scanner port at evaluation time.andM;Although The Complete Pc's line offers you an integrated solution, otherindividual products might be more suited to your needs.andP;  For fax boards, lookinto Intel PCEO'S Connection Coprocessor ($995; C03-07, 5200 NE Elam YoungPkwy., Hillsboro, OR 97124; (800) 538-3373, (503) 629-7354.andP;  It's moreexpensive than the other boards, as well as less flexible.andP;  For instance, theboard cannot operate with any scanners.andP;  But its on-board coprocessor lets itrun true background communications, and you can get (free upon request fromIntel PCEO) Send-off for WordPerfect, a fax utility that may help you easilyintegrate faxing into your work environment.andP;  Along with the ConnectionCoprocessor, the JT-Fax 9600 ($595; Q/ Cor, One Meca Way, Norcross, GA 30093;(404) 564-5528) was our Editor's Choice in the A I issue.andM;As for the ability of a fax board or machine to translate a hand-written faxinto ASCII text-sorry, not yet.andP;  You can't even turn printed text intomachine-recognizable characters without the aid of optical characterrecognition software.andP;  Remember, a fax is just an image of text stored in agraphics file format.andM;Most scanners can scan both text and graphics, although they don'tnecessarily perform both operations equally well.andP;  Some are optimized fordithering or gray scales, making them better for images; others are better atline art and text.andM;Aside from The Complete Pc's scanners, you should look into the Niscan OCRWords andamp; Pictures ($495; Nisca Inc., 1919 Old Denton Rd., #104, Carrollton, TX75006; (214) 242-9696), which gives you a lot of control over halftoningpatterns when scanning graphics and comes bundled with OCR software.andP;  Orcheck out the Logitech Scanman Plus ($339; 6505 Kaiser Dr., Fremont, CA94555; (415) 7958500).andM;Hand scanners can be tricky, however, and it can sometimes take severalpasses to produce a clean scan of text or undistorted graphics.andP;  This isespecially important if you want to perform OCR.andP;  Also, you should try toproject what your needs will be (hand versus page scanner), instead ofwaiting to see if the need arises.andP;  If you know you're going to be doing alot of scanning, getting a full-page scanner might save you a lot of time andtrouble; balance the extra cost of the full-page model against theopportunity cost of your time.andM;If you do opt for a full-page scanner, the Chinon DS-3000 ($745; ChinonAmerica Inc., 660 Maple Ave., Torrance, CA 90503; (800) 441-0222; lastreviewed in the March 28, 1989, issue of PC Magazine) is a relativelyinexpensive compromise with one drawback-the only fax card that operates withit directly is the JT-fax 9600.andP;  You should also check out Hewlett-Packard'sflatbed ScanJet Plus ($2,190 with interface kit; 19310 Pruneridge Ave.,andO;Cupertino, CA 95014; contact an authorized HP dealer).andM;ASK THE ADVISORandM;Send your questions to Advisor, PC Magazine, One Park Avenue, New York, NY10016, or upload them to PC Magnet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot; sidebar in theUtilities column for access information).andP;  Please specify your equipment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
