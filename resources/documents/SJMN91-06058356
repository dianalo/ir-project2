The most controversial condition was to restrictenrollment to 55 children, 10 fewer than Baptist Church officials who run thecenter say they need to keep their program alive financially.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Extra 3  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MONTE SERENO COUNCIL RESOLVES DAY CARE DISPUTE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But the Rev. Frank Emitte, who recently said the First Baptist CommunityChurch might have to close the center if it could not get approval for morethan 55 children, now says the facility definitely will stay open.;    Emittesaid the center probably will lay off two of its nine staff members and cutback on curriculum to streamline the program for 55 children. The program hasbeen geared up for at least 65 children, but for the last several months hasserved only 55, which has caused a monthly deficit.;    The church has kickedin funds to keep the day care program in the black, but it can no longerafford to do that, said Emitte.;    &quot;We're very pleased we got the permit,&quot;said Emitte, &quot;because the objective of some of the neighbors was to put us outof business and that didn't happen.&quot;;    Emitte said the council left the dooropen for the church to return at a later time to request more students.;   The dispute came to a head last year when residents who live next to thechurch renewed complaints of noise and boisterous behavior among the day carecharges. Monte Sereno officials responded by backing the opening of a secondday care center at Daves Avenue School, which would result in the closure ofthe Oak Tree center.;    But church officials did not give up despiteincreased hostility from neighbors and tension that arose between parents ofboth day care centers.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CONNIE SKIPITARES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  343  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 27, 199100058356,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
