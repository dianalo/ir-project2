Along the way he even picked up anOrder of the British Empire.   Today, Mr. Davenport, 55, runs one of the U.K.communications company's most important weapons in the battleto wrest corporate business from giants such as AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Recently, Mr. Davenport talked withThe Wall Street Journal's John J. Keller about globalcompetition and Cable andamp; Wireless's ambitious plan to buildand run a global communications-services business. Here aresome excerpts from that discussion.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   WSJ: Just how much of the U.S. communications-servicesmarket does Cable andamp; Wireless expect to get?   DAVENPORT: We currently have about 0.6% of thelong-distance marketplace. We would dearly like to get thatup. Certainly over 1% in the not-too-distant future.                                                                                                          WSJ: To do that within the next year or so would takealmost a doubling of your business.   DAVENPORT: Right. At the moment we have an agreement withPacific Telecom Inc. to buy TRT/FTC, and that would give us asubstantial quantum leap towards that target.{Washington-based TRT/FTC Communications Inc. provides voiceand data transmission and private-line telephone services tocorporations.}                                                                                                          WSJ: Do U.S. government foreign-ownership rules restrictyou from expanding your business through acquisition?   DAVENPORT: There's no foreign-ownership impediment interms of percentages as long as we don't get into areascovered by the 1934 Communications Act, which specificallyrefers to use of the radio-frequency spectrum. That's wherethe constraints on foreign ownership apply. Although TRT/FTCdoes have, at the moment, some satellite earth stations thatclearly use that frequency spectrum, a provision has beenmade for Pacific Telecom to retain those {facilities}. Wehave two petitions before the Federal CommunicationsCommission. No. 1 is to sanction the acquisition of TRT/FTC.The other is for a change in classification in terms ofcurrently being classified as a dominant carrierinternationally because of our foreign ownership. {When theFCC labels a company a &quot;dominant&quot; carrier, it limits, amongother things, the investment that carrier can make in a U.S.carrier}                                                                                                          WSJ: Why are you classified as a dominant carrier?   DAVENPORT: Any foreign carrier who wishes to provideservice in the international marketplace out of the UnitedStates is automatically classified as dominant. And when Itell you that the only U.S. carrier that has the sameclassification is ATandamp;T and when you consider that I have 0.6%of the marketplace and ATandamp;T has somewhere between 65% and70%, I think you will see there's a certain inequality there.                                                                                                          WSJ: So, you're actually considered a dominant player vs.even MCI or Sprint?   DAVENPORT: Indeed. And that has serious implications interms of filing for introduction of new services, changes inexisting services, changes in tariffing, etc. It's acompetitive disadvantage.                                                                                                          WSJ: If the FCC dropped that restriction, would that pavethe way for Cable andamp; Wireless to acquire a bigger U.S. carrierto augment its existing business?   DAVENPORT: It would be a significant factor in evaluatingthe merits of acquiring a larger U.S. carrier.                                                                                                          WSJ: Would it be feasible for Cable andamp; Wireless to expandin the U.S. by acquiring a bigger carrier?   DAVENPORT: It is feasible, and it would be one way oftaking a very significant step to achieving the group'sstrategic goals.                                                                                                          WSJ: Are further acquisitions part of your game plan?   DAVENPORT: If I deny that, you'll immediately say it is.But I'm denying it anyway. . . . We have no acquisitions onthe go in North America with the exception of TRT/FTC at thepresent moment.                                                                                                          WSJ: But you're not ruling out further acquisitions in thefuture?   DAVENPORT: I think any dynamic company has to keep itsoptions open. But let me say that from a strictly parochialNorth American point of view, just acquiring and digestingthe TRT/FTC acquisition is quite a significant task. I mean,you look at our gross revenues, they show something in excessof $400 million. TRT's gross revenues are probably close to40% of that, so you know it's a significant acquisition. (Inits fiscal year ended March 31, parent Cable andamp; Wireless PLCposted a pretax profit of #609 million, or about US$1.05billion, a 16% increase over the previous year on revenues of#2.6 billion pounds, a 12% increase.)                                                                                                          WSJ: How much is the North American business growing peryear?   DAVENPORT: Let me start by saying we didn't see a lot ofgrowth last year, and we put that down to the economy. Butthis year we're back on track, and we're seeing growth interms of gross revenue year on year of close to 20%.                                                                                                          WSJ: Where does your company fit into Cable andamp; Wireless'soverall expansion strategy?   DAVENPORT: It's very important. The U.S. is the singlebiggest, most competitive, innovative marketplace and wecannot be what we want to be as a group if we don't havesomething with our name on the door in the United States.                                                                                                          WSJ: How big does Cable andamp; Wireless want to be in the U.S.,the second-largest carrier?   DAVENPORT: I'd love to be able to say yes, but I would beless than honest. To try and be No. 2 in the United Stateswould require concentration of resources that I think wouldnot be justified in the context of achieving our goals. Ithink we can achieve our group goals without being No. 2 inthe United States, but I think we've got to be a significantplayer in the United States.                                                                                                          WSJ: Certainly if you acquired a big carrier, you could beNo. 2 in the U.S.   DAVENPORT: We could. But that carrier wouldn't come cheap.                                                                                                          WSJ: Were ATandamp;T, MCI and Sprint more formidable competitorsin the last year?   DAVENPORT: If the market's not growing, there is morecompetition to retain and increase market share. In a growingmarket, there's not quite the same pressure. When themarket's not growing, there is certainly, and there was lastyear, very severe competition to maintain market share.                                                                                                          WSJ: How did that severe competition manifest itself?   DAVENPORT: Pricing was the primary factor. Innovation interms of new services was, is always, a factor, but pricinglast year was very competitive. I'm sure you are awarethere've been some modest price increases this year by ATandamp;T,which tends to set the pricing standards.                                                                                                          WSJ: How far did pricing fall last year in terms ofpercent?   DAVENPORT: It would be less than 5%, but in a veryprice-competitive marketplace that's very significant.                                                                                                          WSJ: Now you're seeing modest price increases from ATandamp;T.Will that cause the other carriers to raise their prices?   DAVENPORT: It would certainly reduce the pressure on themto continue cutting their prices. I really can't speak forthe other carriers. Cable andamp; Wireless, for the moment, is notincreasing its prices in North America. But the pressure tocontinue reducing them is relieved if ATandamp;T's putting theirprices up.                                                                                                          WSJ: Unlike those other U.S. carriers, Cable andamp; Wirelesshas chosen to focus on the corporate market. What are thesecustomers looking for in a communications carrier?   DAVENPORT: Well, typically we're getting inquiries now onan increasing scale for quotations {on the transmission ofvoice, data and video signals} on a global basis with globalpricing. That's a new and significant development. It's aclear indication that there is a developing internationalglobal marketplace.                                                                                                          WSJ: What do you mean by global pricing?   DAVENPORT: A customer will come in and he'll say he wantsus to serve a number of different locations around the worldand he wants to deal with one entity and he wants to have aprice for the whole {service}. He doesn't want to be dealingwith different entities {such as government-owned local phonecompanies in each country} and different prices. If thecustomer can deal with one {supplier} in terms of puttingtogether the network, in putting together the pricingstructure, in dealing with any problems within the network --that's a significant advantage. At the moment, for example,to lease a circuit across the Atlantic you deal with a U.S.carrier in the United States, you deal with a Europeancarrier in Europe. Each one sells you half a circuit. And ifyou have a transmission problem, you need to find the source.We're moving to a situation where there is only one providerof the transmission service from one end of the call to theother.                                                                                                          WSJ: So rather than hire carriers individually, thecustomer would retain Cable andamp; Wireless Communications andleave it up to you to worry about hooking up the differentcircuits in each country?   DAVENPORT: Absolutely. And you wouldn't get the bill inFrench francs for half a circuit and for the other half ofthe circuit in U.S. dollars. You'll get a bill in thecurrency that you specify as the currency you want to bebilled in. And you'll get one bill.   WSJ: You talk a lot about your &quot;global digital highway,&quot; anetwork of sophisticated switching systems linked byfiber-optic cable that carries traffic at very high speeds,and advanced services such as &quot;Planet.&quot; How does any of thisfacilitate communications for a big corporation?   DAVENPORT: Planet is really the network service andequipment through which we will be providing enhancedservices such as video conferencing and high-speed datatransmission to corporations. But as video conferencing, forexample, becomes more commonplace and people accept it morereadily, we intend to provide customers with the facility toeffectively receive the transmission band width they requirejust by dialing a few digits like today you pick up thephone. You can't do that at the present moment. {Currently,corporate customers have to go through an elaborate procedurewhen they want to get special transmission lines to handlesuch services as data transmission and video conferencing.}                                                                                                          WSJ: Is your network capable of providing videotransmission that's as easy as dialing a regular phone call?   DAVENPORT: The network can do that now.                                                                                                          WSJ: What's keeping you from offering it?   DAVENPORT: We don't have the ability at the moment toenable customers to dial up different band widths {thatenable customers to use different services}. Today when youpick up the phone and you dial across the Atlantic, you get acircuit that sends your call at the rate of 64,000 bits persecond {64 kilobits}. In the future you're going to getalmost any bit rate certainly up to 1.5 million bits andprobably beyond that.                                                                                                          WSJ: When you say in the future, when will this happen?   DAVENPORT: We'll be providing band width on demandcertainly between Europe and the United States and within theUnited States early next year.                                                                                                          WSJ: Do you have any interest in doing facilitiesmanagement, managing a corporation's network?   DAVENPORT: Yes, it's a market that we have perceived to begrowing quite significantly. Companies went through a phasewhere they felt they had to bring all their communicationsin-house and run their network themselves with their ownequipment and employ people skilled in telecommunications todo that. A lot of companies are now saying, &quot;But we're not inthe communications business. We're in banking or we're insome other activity, and we'd like to concentrate our effortsand our resources on our core business. We'd like to use anoutside source to run our telecommunications network,preferably one supplier.&quot; That is a requirement we are seeingincreasingly. The demand is increasing.                                                                                                          WSJ: How much is it growing, and how many corporatecustomers do you do this for now?   DAVENPORT: I'm not sure I want to disclose that. That's alittle bit commercially sensitive. We set up a completely newentity just over 12 months ago called Cable andamp; WirelessWorldwide Services with the specific task of managingfacilities and have something close to 100 people working inthe unit. I don't think it has to be many times bigger thanthat to achieve its objectives. I don't think it's an areawhere we're going to see a high growth in people.                                                                                                          WSJ: Is that because you'll use the network-managementcenter that controls your own network to also monitorcustomer networks?   DAVENPORT: Indeed.                                                                                                          WSJ: All of this looks potentially lucrative. But you'refacing stiff competition right now from ATandamp;T in this area.How do you fight ATandamp;T? Cream skimming its most lucrativecustomers such as the big corporations?   DAVENPORT: You may be surprised to know that margins arethinnest because of competition at the {biggest companies.}                                                                                                          WSJ: What are you doing in terms of technology andequipment installation to build this world-wide network thatcorporations can hook up to?   DAVENPORT: Well, we've completed the PTAT {PrivateTransatlantic Telecommunications} fiber-optic cable {co-ownedwith US Sprint Communications} across the Atlantic. We'vealso completed and put into service the North Pacific cable.We are actively extending the North Pacific cable furtherinto Asia from Japan to Korea and Hong Kong. We are mostactive in that area -- not just to those places but certainlyto those places and other destinations in Asia.                                                                                                          WSJ: How much of PTAT's transmission capacity have youfilled so far?   DAVENPORT: In terms of its capacity sales, we're past thepoint where we have to worry about its viability. It's notfull yet, but it's moving in that direction. We're somewherearound the 80% mark.                                                                                                          WSJ: So, is it beginning to pay itself off?   DAVENPORT: Oh, yes. As I say, we don't have to worry aboutit being less than viable as an investment.                                                                                                          WSJ: You are also a part owner in the publicly owned TAT-8and TAT-9 fiber cables {owned by ATandamp;T and numerous U.S. andforeign carriers}. Are you planning any further cableinstallation across the Atlantic to augment the PTAT systems?   DAVENPORT: We've always talked in terms of there being arequirement eventually for a second PTAT cable. No date hasbeen set to proceed with the second cable at this point intime.                                                                                                          WSJ: How will Cable andamp; Wireless link all of these systems?   DAVENPORT: When it's finished, it's going to be a globalmirror image of, for example, what happens currently in theUnited States -- a seamless, transparent-to-the-user networkconnecting the main economic centers of the world.                                                                                                          WSJ: What do you mean by seamless, transparent to theuser?   DAVENPORT: Well, he would use it without concern for howhis calls are going to be routed or how his circuits aregoing to be routed. He would have all the facilities that youget on a PBX {computerized office phone switch}. It would bevery user-friendly, ubiquitous. Just like the nationalnetwork that you enjoy in the U.S. at the present moment. Wehave a lot of centers connected through to Tokyo via theUnited States.                                                                                                          WSJ: How many of these network centers do you plan to havewhen it's all finished?   DAVENPORT: At the present moment we're connected intoEurope via a number of fiber-optic cables from the UnitedKingdom, so we have major centers in Germany and France andthe other European countries connected via London, via NewYork, across the United States with a number of U.S. citiesconnected to the network and then across the Pacific to Japanand down into Hong Kong. Then via Hong Kong into places likethe Philippines and Singapore.                                                                                                          WSJ: Are these all Cable andamp; Wireless-owned facilities?   DAVENPORT: Not in the case of Singapore, for example.Cable andamp; Wireless does have a presence in the Philippines. Itdoes have a presence in Hong Kong. It has an arrangement inKorea. In Japan we are a shareholder in International DigitalCommunications {one of two international carriers permittedby the Japanese government to compete with the monopolycarrier Kokusai Denshin Denwa}.                                                                                                          WSJ: All of this sounds pretty good, but don't you stillhave some high hurdles to jump before you can put thisnetwork together?   DAVENPORT: The major problem is still the regulatoryenvironment. Some impediments still exist in the UnitedStates such as the problem of being designated a dominantcarrier. There are even more serious impediments in theEuropean countries where many still only have monopolyproviders of basic service. But we expect change. What we areplanning for is change.                                                                                                          WSJ: How do you know you'll get the changes you need tosucceed?   DAVENPORT: It's very clear that the European EconomicCommunity is very intent on having competition throughoutEurope.
