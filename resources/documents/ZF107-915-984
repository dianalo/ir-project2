640K required for network use), twodisk drives, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;In Short: Combining first-class word processor and flat-file databasemodules, Qandamp;A is ideal for people whose integrated needs lie with these twoapplications and who prefer to use Lotus 1-2-3 for their spreadsheet data.andO;Strong links to 1-2-3 let spreadsheet users easily integrate theirspreadsheet information into both Write and File modules of Qandamp;A.andM;Qandamp;A: The Answer for ManyandM;Try to guess the name of the quintessential flat-file database, and you'llprobably come up with Qandamp;A.andP;  Yet database functions are only part of the $349program's charm: the word processor included is so good that maker Symantecintroduced an enhanced version of it as a standalone package, Qandamp;A Write.andO;This quickly became the de facto standard among low-cost executive wordprocessing packages.andM;Although features in both of Qandamp;A's applications are plentiful, power andease-of-use are happily conjoined in a smoothy integrated package.andM;Qandamp;A 3.0 operates under an attractive DOS shell that supports six otherprograms on Qandamp;A's main menu, allowing you to use other programs withoutleaving Qandamp;A.andP;  Although Qandamp;A lacks communications and spreadsheet modules, itprovides hooks to send faxes via the Intel Connection CoProcessor board andto include whole or partial spreadsheets from Lotus 1-2-3, Release 2.01, inyour database and word processing files.andP;  You can send faxes in theforeground or in the background while you continue working.andM;Import and export utilities let you work with data from many programs.andP;  Qandamp;Asupports import of .DIF, ASCII, and fixed-ASCII formats, and export toprograms accepting .DIF, ASCII, fixed-ASCII, and .DBF formats.andP;  You can alsoimport, rotate, and size Lotus .PIC graphics at print time.andM;FILE MODULEandM;The File module is the heart of Qandamp;A.andP;  Sixteen million records per data file,1,678 alphanumeric characters per field, 115 fields indexed simultaneously,and forms spanning ten screens and containing 2, 182 fields are a few ofQandamp;A's impressive statistics.andM;You can join data files and sort any field in descending or ascending order.andO;Data field types include character, numeric, currency, keyword, date, hours,and Boolean; financial, statistical, and text/string functions are includedin Qandamp;A's programming language.andM;Another bonus is that you don't need to learn a complicated query language toask questions about your databases.andP;  Qandamp;A's Intelligent Assistant allows youto query your databases in a language you already understand: English.andP;  TheIntelligent Assistant has a basic vocabulary straight out of the box, but youcan teach it words it doesn't know.andP;  In fact, you can teach your IntelligentAssistant to look at your database files the way you do.andM;Although the database portion of Qandamp;A is basically flat-file, it does havesome relational features.andP;  While you are working with a database, externalLookup commands let you retrieve data from secondary databases and include itin the current database.andM;Reports are created from a Report menu, allowing you to save report formats.andO;You can include information from several databases in a single report, with50 columns and a maximum report width of 1,000 characters.andP;  Qandamp;A even allowsyou to use information in one column to calculate that of another column.andM;THE WRITE FEATURESandM;Qandamp;A's Write module has nearly all the features you'll need to creategreat-looking documents.andP;  Multiline headers and footers, variable linespacing, line drawing to create borders and boxes, a 100,000-word dictionaryto spell-check your documents, eight columns per page, powerfulsearch-and-replace functions, a strikeover option, and soft hyphenation arejust a few of Qandamp;A's advanced document-creation features.andP;  Characterenhancements include italic, bold, underlining, superscript, and subscript.andO;What's missing?andP;  Multiple windows, indexing, table of contents generation,outlining, and footnotes.andP;  You're also limited to working with only onedocument at a time.andM;Because an open document is held in memory--up to 80 pages--editing functionsare performed quickly.andP;  To create professional-looking documents, you caninclude nine fonts per document, and Qandamp;A offers laser printer and PostScriptsupport.andM;Creating form letters is a simple matter with Qandamp;A's powerful mail-mergecapabilities.andP;  While you're creating a form letter, Alt-F7 will activateQandamp;A's mail-merge feature.andP;  Choose from a list of databases or type in thename of one.andP;  Then position your cursor at the point where you want toinclude the field data.andP;  Your next step is to type in the name of the fieldor choose the field from a list of those in the database you've selected.andP;  Asyou update the database, the changes are reflected in your merged document.andM;To create mailing labels for letters, simply choose the Mailing Label optionfrom the Write menu.andP;  Choose from a list of standard Avery and pin-feedmailing labels, then select a Qandamp;A database file from which to extract themailing label data.andP;  Although default fields of first name, last name,address, city, state, and ZIP code are given, you can add, delete, or changethe fields to match the database.andP;  A keystroke combination gives you a listof fields in the database.andM;You can create macros from within a Write document, a file, a report spec, orthe Intelligent Assistant.andP;  You can also create macros that span severalprogram modules.andP;  Macros aren't automatically saved to disk, so you mustremember to save them.andM;Qandamp;A's Network Pack ($299) allows three additional users to share a copy ofQandamp;A on a network.andP;  Five levels of password protection, administrative rights,and record locking ensure data security.andP;  DOS and OS/2 (Qandamp;A OS/2 carries thesame list price of $349) users can even share data with no additional setup.andO;In fact, you can assign access rights when using a single copy of Qandamp;A.andM;A well-designed interface, two levels--user-customized and system--ofcontext-sensitive help, and excellent documentation are boons to beginnersand experts alike.andP;  If you're a resolute 1-2-3 user and are looking to expandto a real database and word processor, or if you're an infrequent spreadsheetuser desiring the best database-and-word-processor combination around, Qandamp;Acan't be beat.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
