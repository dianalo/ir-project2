Of the 50 or so foreign companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange who meet the eligibility requirements, only one has expressed any interest, Finance Ministry officals say.    An offical at Dow Chemical Co. confirmed that the company is &quot;thinking of issuing Samurai commercial paper.&quot; But he added, &quot;At the moment the timing and the amount are not yet finalized.&quot; Samurai commercial paper refers to yen funds raised by non-Japanese companies in Japan.    The decision to allow a Samurai commercial paper market is part of the Finance Ministry's strategy to bring the yen market back to Japan. In the past, corporate borrowers who needed yen went to the less regulated Eurobond markets, leaving the domestic market to stagnate. To develop the money markets, the ministry started a domestic commercial paper market last November, open only to Japanese.    It is customary here for banks and brokerage firms to show support for market-opening measures. So underwriters will scramble to come up with a few deals during the first week, even if it means shaving their margins to the bone, analysts say.    But even with help from a generous broker, the Samurai commercial paper market leaves a lot to be desired. Given current market rates, it is cheaper to raise funds elsewhere, and the stamp tax the Japanese government levies on each issue also adds another expense. </TEXT></DOC>
