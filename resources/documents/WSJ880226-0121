One reason we hear this is that Richard W. Munson keeps saying it. Running a group he founded called Victims of Fiberglass, Mr. Munson writes letters by the hundreds to labor unions, manufacturers, consumer advocates and government officials, telling of the perils the material holds for America's health. He travels and gives speeches about it. Quick with a quote, he appears on TV news programs as an expert on fiberglass's dangers.    The rest of the time, he sells a competing type of insulation.    Mr. Munson is the president of a company that makes wood-based cellulose, the arch rival of fiberglass. He also leads a group that, in effect, serves as a trade association for cellulose companies.    Now, are we still supposed to believe what Mr. Munson says about fiberglass?    He doesn't see why not. &quot;Somebody has got to warn people,&quot; he declares, not denying his economic conflict of interest. (Fiberglass firms have one too, he argues.) &quot;I have no fear of becoming the protagonist,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm an idealist. I'm a humanitarian. I just want to have my name scratched in history as having made this a better place to live.&quot;    Mr. Munson, who has no scientific background, didn't originate the cancer theory. For years some scientists have suspected that because long, thin glass fibers are roughly the same size and shape as those of asbestos, they too could lodge in the lungs and perhaps raise a person's odds of developing cancer.    The evidence, however, is sketchy and ambiguous. Reviewing it, a World Health Organization unit last June termed glass wool (the form of fiberglass used in insulation) a possible carcinogen. Though there isn't enough evidence to link it to human cancer, the agency said, malignancies did develop in some test animals when glass fibers were implanted in their lungs. But breathing air containing glass fibers didn't give test animals tumors, and forms of fiberglass other than glass wool weren't implicated.    &quot;There is no question that fiberglass can produce cancer under some circumstances,&quot; says Irving J. Selikoff, a physician and leader of the campaign against asbestos. &quot;But if you're looking for direct information about its effect on humans, we don't have the studies yet. We just don't know.&quot;    Where science treads cautiously, Mr. Munson doesn't hesitate. &quot;You read all the medical documents and it's frustrating,&quot; he says. &quot;I've never seen so many may-be's and might-be's and could-be's.&quot; Rather than be stymied by them, he has often made stronger statements on his own.    Consider the case of Licking County, Ohio, where Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. runs the world's oldest and largest fiberglass plant. After Mr. Munson learned the area had an unusually high rate of death from lung cancer, he sent a letter to every single-family home in the county, suggesting that Owens-Corning fiber emissions were the cause. That's 16,700 letters, all warning of a &quot;death dust cloud&quot; above the community.    Owens-Corning responded with its own mass mailing, saying Mr. Munson had taken the data out of context. State and local officials agree, questioning how Mr. Munson could finger a single culprit in an area that is rife with factories and chemical plants and where, local doctors note, a blue-collar population smokes heavily.    State officials also say many other Ohio counties have even higher lung-cancer morbidity rates than Licking County. &quot;The whole letter borders on ludicrous,&quot; says Robert Indian, an epidemiologist in the state health department.    Adds Michael Thorne, the chief pathologist at Licking Memorial Hospital: &quot;Sure, a problem might exist. But it's a heck of a thing when you start taking potshots and you aren't sure where the bullets are going to go. This letter has created a lot of fear.&quot;    Mr. Munson -- who has never set foot in Licking County -- hopes so. &quot;It takes a lot to motivate people,&quot; he says. &quot;Sometimes I don't think I go far enough.&quot;    A rebel without a pause, he works six days a week, mostly on the road, at dragging down one form of insulation and building up another. &quot;I'll tell you one outfit that makes a mint from Mr. Munson,&quot; says an Owens-Corning spokesman, Bradford Oelman. &quot;The Postal Service.&quot;    Mr. Munson's interest in these matters traces to the energy crisis of the 1970s, when the former North Dakota farmboy, who now is 51, started an insulation business. &quot;I'm not a good do-it-yourselfer,&quot; he says. &quot;I just thought I could make some money at it.&quot; In 1979 he sold his firm to a Denver maker of cellulose insulation, Shelter Shield Corp., which made him a vice president.    There, he became a big fan of the wood-fiber material. &quot;It's God's natural insulation,&quot; he says excitedly. &quot;It's like motherhood and apple pie.&quot; He calls fiberglass &quot;man-made asbestos.&quot;    Before long Mr. Munson struck out on his own again, founding a group that more or less serves as a cellulose trade association, National Consumer Products Marketing Inc. He also now is the president of Thermolite Corp., a maker of a brand of cellulose insulation sold at home-improvement stores. And he has Victims of Fiberglass, a tiny organization partly financed by cellulose makers.    It is his truest passion, he says. With it, &quot;I feel like a good minister at the pulpit.&quot;    Before cancer, he preached of other sins of fiberglass. In 1983, he urged &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to expose how some installers fluffed it up and cheated homeowners. &quot;You will touch off a controversy that will make the Watergate scandal look like a Boy Scout picnic,&quot; he wrote to the CBS program (which didn't do a story).    The next year, he told the Environmental Protection Agency that fiberglass insulation gives off dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide when it catches fire. He wrote: &quot;The fiberglass industry stands accused of having turned every home in America into a GAS CHAMBER.&quot;    Mr. Munson has largely dropped those issues. It is with the cancer connection that he has really found his voice. He fell in love with a book on the asbestos industry and cancer called &quot;Outrageous Misconduct,&quot; by Paul Brodeur, and has underlined sentence after sentence and dogeared page after page.    He thinks history is repeating itself in the $3 billion-a-year fiberglass industry, especially given that many big producers -- most notably Manville Corp. -- used to make asbestos. He plans to write his own book on that. Working title: &quot;The Sin of Sins.&quot;    Yet this zeal can lead to awkward situations. After a TV reporter at a Salt Lake City station affiliated with ABC interviewed him for a series on fiberglass, Mr. Munson solicited donations by sending out 150 tapes of the TV report -- along with a flier that reproduced the reporter's business card and the logo of ABC News. The reporter, Jerry Andersch of station KTVX, says, &quot;It looks like we're endorsing his cause, and that's totally out of line. But, you know, I honestly don't think Dick saw what he was doing wrong.&quot;    Mr. Munson also tells reporters that a former Owens-Corning pollution-control officer has damaging information on fiberglass. The man, expressing annoyance at calls from the press, says he can provide no such thing and has never even met Mr. Munson. (Mr. Munson confirms that.)    Scientists are equally wary. A leading fiberglass researcher, Prof. J. Corbett McDonald of McGill University in Montreal, says, &quot;My colleagues and I all discuss him, and we agree that one needs to view him with caution. He has a way of taking things out of context.&quot;    For all his excesses, Mr. Munson has won some defenders. Ned Nisson, the editor of a publication called Energy Design Update, listened to his arguments for two years before finally putting them in print. &quot;His image has changed in our eyes,&quot; Mr. Nisson says, &quot;from a fanatical representative of a competing industry to a guy with a chip on his shoulder to a guy with something important to say.&quot;    Ralph Nader, who gets Mr. Munson's mailings, cautions against dismissing him because of his hyperbole. &quot;Historically, that is what it has taken&quot; to get the public interested, he says.    To a reporter visiting Mr. Munson in his home near Sacramento, he shares a secret about his seeming obsession. Ten years ago, when his first company was just starting, one thing it produced was asbestos paneling. &quot;I harmed a lot of kids who worked for me,&quot; Mr. Munson says. &quot;They all went home looking like snowmen at night. That bothers my conscience.&quot;    And him? He holds a series of X-rays to the light and points to some tiny spots on his lungs, indicative of asbestosis. &quot;I didn't want people to know,&quot; Mr. Munson says. &quot;I didn't want them to think I'm just trying to get even.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
