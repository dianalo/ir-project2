(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A saboteur ripped insulation laced withcancer-causing asbestos from pipes at Nassau County governmentoffices and placed it in front of air-circulation fans, police said.   The fans were shut off when the asbestos was found, and testsfound no dangerous levels in the air at the County ExecutiveBuilding, Health Department spokeswoman Shelly Domash saidWednesday.   Airborne asbestos fibers can be inhaled and cause debilitatinglung disease and even lung cancer.   Inspector Donald White, of Nassau County Police Department, saidthe asbestos insulation also was found in front of a fan at policeheadquarters but officials didn't test the air because theybelieved the material was found soon enough to prevent danger.   ``This is not an act of vandalism,'' White said. ``Someoneintentionally ripped the asbestos off the pipes and strategicallyput it in an area which they thought could hurt someone.''   County engineers also found torn insulation in front of fans ina third county building, but that insulation contained no asbestos,authorities said.   The three rooms involved are locked and located in secured areaswhich are not easily accessible without identification cards, Whitesaid. There was no evidence of a break-in.   ``Someone didn't walk off the street and do this,'' he said.``The individual or individuals had to know what they were doingand had access to the areas.''   Asbestos insulation was found in front of fans Monday andTuesday at the county police headquarters and an undergroundemergency operations center behind police headquarters.   No problems had been found in the ventilation rooms when theywere checked by the same engineer on routine rounds 24 hoursearlier, according to White.   There are 300 to 400 county employees in the three buildings.   ``It could have been anyone: a disgruntled employee, maybesomeone who is trying to make a statement,'' White said.</TEXT></DOC>
