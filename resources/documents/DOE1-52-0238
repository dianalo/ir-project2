Taking equipmentout of service may affect the ability of the plant to produce power ata certain power level and may also affect the status of the plant withregard to technical specifications. However, plant operators and supervisorspossess few tools that can rapidly determine plant availability and systemstatus, can assess the impact on plant health (e.g., likelihood of continuedoperation) of taking equipment in or out of service, and can presentinformation on required actions or desired alternatives. The plant statusmonitor (PSM), which is a part of Rapid software development under therisk assessment program of the Nuclear Power Division at the ElectricPower Research Institute (EPRI), is designed to provide such informationto plant personnel as an aid to their decision making. The Rapid/PSMcan assist the management of plant safety and productivity and can minimizethe potential technical specification violations. This paper describesthe lessons learned from the development and demonstration of Rapid/PSMsoftware at GPU Nuclear Corporation's (GPUN's) Oyster Creek Nuclear GenerationPlant.</TEXT></DOC>
