Newman variety <T3>americana</T3> Fernald (American hart's-tongue fern) has evergreen,strap-shaped fronds that are 5 to 17 inches long (12 to 42 cm), \3/4\ to1\3/4\ inches wide 2 to 4.5 cm) and are auriculate (lobed) at their base.The green petiole portion of the frond is 1 to 5 inches long (3 to 12 cm)and has cinnamon-colored scales on its surface. The sori (groups of spore-producingreproductive structures called sporangia) are linear in shape and occuron the underside of the blade portion of the frond. The fronds arise ina cluster from a short, creeping rhizome which is covered with cinnamon-coloredscales (Evans 1981, Lellinger 1985). Ferns recognized as belonging to thespecies <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> (then referred to as <T3>Scolopendrium vulgare</T3>) were first discovered in the United Statesin 1807 when Pursh found the species growing in central New York (Maxon1900).<T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3>, described by Linneus in 1753, is commonin the British Isles and is rare to frequent in Europe (Love 1954, Small1938). In 1849, Gattinger discovered the species in Roane County, Tennessee(Maxon 1900); and in 1857, Hincks found it in Grey County, Ontario, Canada(Soper 1954). In 1953 Hall and Hagenah discovered the species growing inChippewa County, Michigan (Hagenah 1953). Osterlund, Batchelder, and Shortdiscovered it in Jackson County, Alabama, in 1979 (Batchelder 1979, Short1979). Fernald described the taxon <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>americana </T3>in 1935. He distinguished it from the European varietyon the basis of several distinct morphological features. These featuresinclude smaller fronds, fewer and shorter indusia (coverings over the sori),the presence of elongate tips on the frond's veinlets, and the distanceof the veinlets from the edge of the frond (Fernald 1935).Britton (1953) determined that, in addition to the morphological charactersdescribed by Fernald, the North American representatives of <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> differed from the European plants cytologicallyin having 144 rather than 72 chromosomes. Lellinger (1985) also notes that<T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>scolopendrium</T3> is much more easily cultivated than is <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>americana.</T3> Love and Love (1973) included the American hart's-tonguefern within their concept of <T3>Phyllitis japonica</T3> Kom. and designated it ssp. <T3>americana </T3>(Fern.) Love and Love. Some authors (e.g., Kartesz andKartesz, 1980) include the genus <T3>Phyllitis</T3> within <T3>Asplenium.</T3> Neither of these treatments has been widely acceptedin the United States. Lellinger's 1985 treatment that maintains the genus<T3>Phyllitis</T3> and includes American hart's-tongue fern in the Europeanrather than the Japanese species is followed here.In North America <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>is usually found growing on or at least in close associationwith dolomitic limestone (limestone high in magnesium). This extremelyrare fern is currently known from only seven counties in the Canadian Provinceof Ontario, two counties in New York, two counties in Michigan, two countiesin Alabama, and one county in Tennessee. In the northern part of its rangeit usually occurs on or adjacent to limestone outcrops. The southern populationsare only found within limestone pits that trap cold air, have high humidity,and are well shaded. At all known locations, American hart's-tongue fernappears to require high humidity, shaded conditions, a moist substrate,and the presence of dolomitic limestone. In the 181 years that have elapsed since first being discovered in NorthAmerica, American hart's-tongue fern has remained an extremely rare taxonthat is found in small, widely disjunct groups of populations. Concernfor the continued existence of this species has long been voiced by thoseinterested in the preservation of the flora of the United States. Thisconcern is demonstrated by early articles such as Benedict's 1925 ``Savingthe Hart's Tongue,'' House's 1934 ``Saving the Scolopendrium Fern,'' andFaust's 1960 ``Survival of Hart's-tongue Fern in Central New York.'' <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>remains vulnerable to extinction throughout most ofits range. A description of the status of the species in each North AmericanState or province in which it occurs is provided below: <T3>Alabama. </T3>There are two known populations of American hart's-tonguefern in Alabama. Both populations were discovered by cavers associatedwith the Huntsville Grotto of the National Speleological Society (Batchelder1979, Evans 1982). One population occurs in a Jackson County sinkhole thatis on lands managed as a national wildlife refuge by the Service. Short(1979) observed 20 plants present when he first visited the site. Evans(1981) found that the population had dwindled to nine plants by July 1981.Evans further states that this population appears, for undetermined reasons,to be in static or declining condition. The other population is in MorganCounty in the privately owned pit entrance to a limestone cave. This populationis located about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of the Jackson County population(Short 1980). Evans (1981) reports that this is a vigourous, healthy, reproducingpopulation, which in 1981 supported 97 plants (26 fertile adults, 13 subadults,and 58 juveniles). <T3>Tennessee. </T3>Tennessee has two records of American hart's-tonguefern. The first of these was discovered in the entrance to a Roane Countycave by Gattinger in 1849. Despite repeated searches for the plant at thissite since the early 1900s, it has not been seen again and is consideredto be extirpated from the area (Maxon 1900, Shaver 1954, Evans 1981). Theonly extant Tennessee population is in Marion County and was discoveredby Cheatham in 1879 (Williamson 1879, Evans 1981). Originally supportingabout 200 plants, this population has contained only about 17 plants inthe recent past (Evans 1981). Early concern about the decline of this populationled Graves in 1929 to scatter American hart's-tongue fern spores at thesite. The spores were obtained from a plant collected in Ontario, Canada(McGilliard 1936). There appears to be no method of distinguishing Tennesseefrom Canadian representatives of this taxon; therefore, it is impossibleto know the origin of the few plants that survive there. From 1982 to thepresent time, the site has been leased by The Nature Conservancy for theexpress purpose of protecting this species. <T3>Michigan. </T3>The Michigan Natural Features Inventory recognizes fourextant populations of American hart's-tongue fern (Sue Crispin, MichiganNatural Features Inventory, personal communication, 1986). All of thesesites are in Mackinac County. Plants at one additional site in ChippewaCounty have not been observed since 1983, and the species may have beenextirpated from the county. Of the four remaining populations, two areowned by the Michigan Nature Association. Both of the association's populationsare healthy and support several hundred plants each. One population ofapproximately 64 plants is on land managed by the U.S. Forest Service (HiawathaNational Forest) (Henson 1978). To protect this population, the ForestService rerouted a trail which was proposed for the area (Voss <T3>in litt.</T3>). The last population is on privately owned, unprotectedland in fairly close proximity to the two populations owned by the MichiganNature Association (Crispin, personal communication, 1986; Nepstad 1981;Futyma 1980; Hagenah 1953 and 1956). <T3>New York. </T3>The plight of <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana</T3> in New York has been carefully documented since theearly 1900s (Hunter 1922; Faust 1960; Cinquemani <T3>et al. </T3>1988). The delineation of individual populations providedhere is that used by the New York Natural Heritage Program (Clemants <T3>in litt.</T3>). Their identification of populations is based primarilyupon Faust (1960) and Hunter (1922). The fern is known from a limited area within Madison and Onandaga Counties.Thirteen populations are currently recognized by the program; 3 of theseare in Madison County, and 10 are or were in Onandaga County. Four of the 10 Onandaga County populations are believed to be extirpated.Three of these were destroyed by quarrying operations between 1924 and1935 and one by undetermined means soon after 1959. Four populations aresmall and vulnerable and in 1988 contained 4, 11, 88, and 271 individuals,respectively (Cinquemani <T3>in litt.</T3>). The remaining two populations are the largest in NewYork and indeed are the largest populations in the United States. Thesetwo populations are located in a State park, and in 1988 they containeda combined total of 2,657 individuals (Cinquemani <T3>in litt.</T3>).Madison County supports three populations. Two of these, containing 48and 54 plants respectively, are on unprotected privately owned lands. Thethird, which contained 346 plants in 1988, is within a State park (Cinquemani<T3>in litt.</T3>). About half of the plants that were originally in thepark were destroyed before 1980 by trail construction and subsequent erosion.<T3>Canada. Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>is listed as a rare species in the Atlas of the RareVascular Plants of Ontario. Although locally abundant in the center ofits range in Grey County, it was included in the Atlas ``* * * becausemost of its world population occurs in the Province. On a continental basis,this is a very small area and all of the peripheral populations in theUnited States are at risk'' (Dickson and White 1983). Adjacent southernBruce County also supports healthy populations of the taxon. Much smallerand more isolated populations occur in Peel, Halton, Dufferin, and SimcoeCounties (Soper 1954, Britton <T3>in litt.</T3>). A population located near Niagara Falls in WellandCounty may have been extirpated by human activities or may have disappearedfor other reasons (Hinds <T3>in litt.</T3>). Soper (1954) states that this population may have beentransplanted to the site in the late 1800s. No plants have been observedthere since 1925 (Dickson and White 1983).Fernald (1970) includes New Brunswick in his description of the range ofAmerican hart's-tongue fern. However, Hinds (<T3>in litt.</T3>) states that the material collected in New Brunswickis the European variety and that the species is not believed to be nativeto the Province.<T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>is threatened throughout most of its range by trampling,alteration, or destruction of its habitat by timber removal, quarrying,and residential or other development (Evans 1981, Nepstad 1981). Britton(<T3>in litt.</T3>) states that the most significant threats to the Canadianpopulations are ``* * * lumbering or development of the escarpment landse.g. quarries, ski slopes, country estates, etc.'' on which it occurs.Federal government actions on this species began with section 12 of theEndangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presentedto Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service publisheda notice (40 FR 27823) that formally accepted the Smithsonian report asa petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3))of the Act. By accepting this report as a petition, the Service also acknowledgedits intention to review the status of those plant taxa named within thereport. <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana</T3> was included in the Smithsonian report and the July1, 1975, notice of review. On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposedrule (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant taxato be endangered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act; <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>was included in this proposal.The 1978 amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 yearsold be withdrawn. On December 10, 1979 (44 FR 70796), the Service publisheda notice withdrawing plants proposed on June 16, 1976. <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>was included as a category 2 species in the revisednotice of review for native plants published on December 15, 1980 (45 FR82480). Category 2 species are those for which the Service has informationthat indicates that proposing to list them as endangered or threatenedmay be appropriate but for which substantial data on biological vulnerabilityand threats are not currently known or on file to support the preparationof rules. This species was also included in category 2 when the noticeof review for native plants was again revised in 1983 (48 FR 53640) andin 1985 (50 FR 39526). The Service funded surveys to determine the Alabama,Tennessee, and Michigan status of <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>in 1980, and final reports for these surveys were acceptedby the Service in 1981. Additional information on the status of the speciesthroughout its range and on threats to its continued existence have nowbeen obtained by the Service.All plants included in the comprehensive plant notices are treated as underpetition. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended in 1982, requires theSecretary to make certain findings on pending petitions within 12 monthsof their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requiresthat all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having beennewly submitted on that date. This was the case for <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>because of the acceptance of the 1975 Smithsonian reportas a petition. In 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987, the Service found thatthe petitioned listing of <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>was warranted but precluded by other listing actionsof a higher priority and that additional data on vulnerability and threatswas still being gathered.On September 12, 1988, the Service published (53 FR 35210) a proposal tolist American hart's-tongue fern as a threatened species. That proposalconstituted the final 1-year finding as required by the 1982 amendmentsto the Endangered Species Act. The proposal provided information on thespecies' biology, status, and threats, and the potential implications oflisting. The proposal also solicited comments on the status, distribution,and threats to the species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the September 12, 1988, proposed rule and associated notifications,all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices inviting public comment were published in <T3>The Daily Sentinel </T3>(Jackson County, Alabama), <T3>The Decatur Daily </T3>(Morgan County, Alabama), <T3>The St. Ignace News </T3>(Mackinac County, Michigan), <T3>The Oneida Daily Dispatch </T3>(Madison County, New York), <T3>The Herald-Journal </T3>(Onondaga County, New York), and <T3>The Jasper Journal </T3>(Marion County, Tennessee).Seventeen comments were received in response to the proposed rule. Allcomments provided additional information on the status or distributionof the species and/or expressed support for the addition of American hart's-tonguefern to the Federal list of endangered and threatened species. Two commenterssuggested that because of the vulnerability of the United States populationsto extirpation, the species should be listed as endangered rather thanthreatened. The States of Michigan and Tennessee expressed support forthe addition of the species to the Federal list. The State of New Yorkpreviously expressed support for this action, and it is anticipated thatthe State of Alabama will cooperate in the protection of the species whenit is added to the Federal list. No Federal activities were identifiedthat would be affected by the addition of American hart's-tongue fern tothe Federal list.The new information provided in response to the proposed rule has beenincorporated into this final rule where appropriate. The Service concurswith the conclusion that <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>merits protection under the Act. The Service has evaluatedthe available information on the range-wide status of, and threats to,this species and believes that threatened status is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>should be classified as a threatened species. Proceduresfound at Section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgatedto implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A speciesmay be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more ofthe five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and theirapplication to <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>(L.) Newman var. <T3>americana </T3>Fernald (American hart's-tongue fern) (Syn. <T3>Phyllitis japonica </T3>Kom. ssp. <T3>americana </T3>Love and Love) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>American hart's-tongue fern is threatenedthroughout most of its range by trampling, habitat alteration, or destructionby timber removal, quarrying or residential development. The southern populationsare especially vulnerable to extirpation by inadvertent trampling becauseof their small size and the steep precarious nature of their habitat. Short(1979) reports that between October 21, 1978, and November 24, 1978, oneof the 20 plants that occurred at the Jackson County, Alabama, site wasdestroyed by someone who had apparently slid off the main trail and ontothe plant. Evans (1981) reports that in July 1981 only nine plants remainedat this location. Quarrying operations destroyed three of New York's populationsand remain a threat to at least one of the remaining New York sites andtwo of the southern sites (Clemants <T3>in litt., </T3>Evans 1981). Timber removal at most of the sites wouldbe expected to raise light levels and lower humidity levels to the detrimentof the species. Alterations associated with residential or other developmentwould, in most cases, either directly destroy the plants present or resultin environmental changes that would make the sites unsuitable for Americanhart's-tongue fern. As previously stated, lumbering, quarrying, or othertypes of development are considered to be the most significant threatsto the Ontario populations of the species.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>There is limited commercial trade in <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium </T3>var. <T3>americana. </T3>The material currently in trade is believed to be ofcultivated origin and not obtained from the wild populations. The originalsource of this material was one of the New York populations destroyed inthe early 1900s by quarry operations (S. Clemants, New York Natural HeritageProgram, personal communication, 1988). Most of the populations in NewYork, Michigan, Alabama, and Tennessee are much too small to support anycollecting for scientific purposes, for fern enthusiasts, or for otherreasons. Inappropriate collecting remains a threat to these populations(Nepstad 1981). The larger Ontario populations have withstood, apparentlywithout ill effects, low levels of collecting for some time (Pryer <T3>in litt.</T3>).C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Disease and predation are not known to befactors affecting the continued existence of the species at this time.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3>var. <T3>americana </T3>is listed as endangered under Michigan's EndangeredSpecies Act and Tennessee's Rare Plant Protection and Conservation Act.In Michigan, taking is prohibited on all public and private lands; in Tennessee,taking is only restricted when the permission of the landowner or managerhas not been obtained. In New York the species is protected under the ProtectedNative Plants Law, which states that removal of the fern without the landowner'spermission is a violation of the law and subjects the violator to a $25fine. In Alabama the species does not receive any protection by the State.Addition of the species to the Federal list of endangered and threatenedspecies provides additional protection from taking. Protection from inappropriatecommercial trade (utilizing plants of wild origin rather than cultivatedmaterial) will also be provided.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Because of climatic changes, the southern populations of the speciesare restricted to extremely rare sites with physical environments thatduplicate the conditions under which the northern populations grow. Duringthe glacial period, the species may have been more widespread in southernlimestone areas; but as the climate has warmed, it has become restrictedto a few sites in or near caves (Evans 1982).Crispin (personal communication 1986) reports that in 1985 an infestationof leaf miners destroyed the leaves on the trees above one of the Michigansites. The loss of shade that resulted from this alteration of the canopydesiccated many of the ferns growing on the forest floor. Insect infestationsthat temporarily remove the leaves of the canopy or result in long-termdamage to the trees found there remain a threat to the species.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>americana</T3> as a threatened species. Critical habitat is not beingdesignated for the reasons discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a species,which is considered to be critical habitat, at the time the species isdetermined to be endangered or threatened. Most populations of this speciesare small, and loss of even a few individuals to activities such as collectionfor scientific purposes could extirpate the species from some locations.Publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would increase thevulnerability of the species without significantly increasing protection.The owners and managers of all the known populations of <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>americana</T3> have been made aware of the plant's location and ofthe importance of protecting the plant and its habitat. No additional benefitswould result from a determination of critical habitat. Therefore, the Serviceconcludes that it is not prudent to designate critical habitat for <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>americana.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protecton, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. All but twoof the known populations of <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>americana</T3> are on privately owned or State-owned land. One Alabamapopulation is on land managed as a national wildlife refuge by the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service, and one of the Michigan populations is on landsmanaged by the U.S. Forest Service. There are no known current or plannedFederal activities that may affect this species.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, apply. These prohibitions, in part,make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisidiction of the UnitedStates to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commercein the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale this speciesin interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possessionthe species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivatedspecimens of threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitionsprovided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers.The 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act protect listed plantsfrom malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands. In addition theseamendments prohibit removal, cutting, digging up, damaging, or destroyingthese plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, includingState criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions can apply to agents ofthe Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.72 alsoprovide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activitiesinvolving threatened species under certain circumstances. It is anticipatedthat few trade permits would ever be sought or issued since <T3>Phyllitis scolopendrium</T3> var. <T3>americana</T3> is not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington, DC 20038-7329, (202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, neednot be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to Section4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outliningthe Service's reasons for this determination was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="75">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Batchelder, E. 1979.
