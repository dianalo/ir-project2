But their $60,000 one-bedroom waterfront condominium ``off thebeaten path,'' was anything but paradise.   ``We were uncomfortable with some of the aspects of living inBarbados that tourists wouldn't necessarily be aware of,'' saidCowell, an advertising executive from Guilford, Conn. ``It was a lotmore crowded than we thought ... there were social problems . .. andhigh taxes.''   Many others intoxicated by an idyllic overseas stay this summercould end up as unhappy as the Cowells _ who've since sold theirBarbados condo for one elsewhere in the Caribbean. Internationalreal estate experts and vacationers-turned-property owners warn allpotential buyers to use their heads, not their emotions when makingsuch foreign investments.   ``You have to do your research,'' said Jeanne Begg, president ofBegg International, a Washington real estate firm with listings inEurope and the Caribbean.   Cowell used his experience to set up Island Properties Report, amonthly research publication that provides tips on buying realestate in the Caribbean and the Bahamas and lists availableproperty. The publication costs $2 a copy; a sample copy is free.   For the more adventurous, the Key Largo, Fla., publicationPrivate Islands Unlimited provides a listing of islands for salearound the world, ranging from a small undeveloped isle off Belizeselling for $15,000 to full-scale resorts for around $10 million.The annual fee is $25.   Wherever you might be looking, don't expect many bargains. ``Theworld has become small enough so that people don't get the bargainsthey used to get,'' said Mrs. Begg.   In Europe, especially, real estate has appreciated at about thesame staggering rate as with many U.S. properties. A home inLondon's Docklands section, near the Thames River, which cost around$20,000 20 years ago now fetches more than 10 times that price.   ``Paris is out of sight,'' added Mrs. Begg, noting that a flat inthat city is just as expensive as in Manhattan. ``You might be ableto get good deals in un-chic places.''   Mrs. Begg recommends that those seriously considering buyingvacation property abroad spend as much time in that country as theycan, particularly in the off season, to get a feel for local lifeand to check out essentials like water availability. Renting firstis also suggested.   Each country has its own restrictions and laws that should bereviewed with a local attorney. Some, such as Italy, don't allowforeigners to take profits from the sale of their property out ofthe country. Others, like Mexico, prevent outsiders from actuallyowning land near the coast or the border.   In the Caribbean, many countries impose a ``foreign purchase'' or``alien landowners'' tax of about 10 percent of the purchase pricewhen you buy and 8 percent when you sell.   Foreign banks also have their own set of restrictions, and mostwon't give you a mortgage, experts say. While U.S. banks willprovide money for foreign home purchases, most prefer a hefty downpayment of around 30 percent to 50 percent, they say.   Experts say a home-equity loan may be the best way to finance asecond home overseas.   Like second-home mortgages, the interest is deductable no matterwhere you buy, providing the value of your primary and secondaryhomes don't exceed $1.1 million, said Jack Rodman, managing directorfor Kenneth Leventhal andamp; Co., a Los Angeles accounting firmspecializing in real estate. But he warns that to receive a fulldeduction you can only borrow $100,000 above the value of yourexisting mortgage.   To help offset expenses some people rent out their foreignproperties. However, Cowell warns you should be prepared to sharepart of that income with the locals you'll have to hire to clean ormanage the property.   You also should be prepared for delays, whether in closing thedeal or renovating property.   ``In many countries time is not of the essence,'' said DonaldWard, publisher of Private Islands Unlimited. ``Building suppliesmay also be limited.''   Fern Pomerantz, of Cleveland, Ohio, who subscribes to Cowell'sIsland Properties Report, can vouch for that. She recently wrote inthe newsletter that it took 1{ years to build a house on propertyshe bought in St. Kitts, and even after it was completed she had toput up with a few minor inconveniences.   ``The surprise of discovering 20 cows outside our window eachmorning ... (necessitated) the immediate construction of a fence,''she said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday, Aug. 31</NOTE></DOC>
