Mossberg   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/07/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><GV>STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- By seizing Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has madehimself a possible broker in the U.S.-Iranian dispute overthe six U.S. hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iraniankidnappers.   That's because Iraq now gains control over 15 pro-IranianShiite terrorists who have been imprisoned in Kuwait andwhose freedom has been demanded repeatedly by both thekidnappers and Iran's government as a condition for releasingthe U.S. hostages.</LP><TEXT>   The Shiite group, members of the pro-Iranian Da'wa party,includes a brother-in-law of one of the Lebanesehostage-holders, Imad Mugniyah. Mr. Mugniyah's faction,Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has demanded the releaseof the Da'wa prisoners in return for freeing the U.S.hostages it says it holds, including Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent of the Associated Press.   Kuwait's charge d'affaires in Jordan, Faisal al-Mukhaizem,told the Reuters news agency Sunday that the 15 had beentaken to Baghdad Friday. &quot;They are going to use them asbargaining counters,&quot; Reuters quoted the diplomat as saying.Earlier, ABC News had reported that the men had been freedduring Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   But U.S. intelligence hasn't been able to confirm eitherreport or other claims that the prisoners have been executed.&quot;We just don't know where they are right now,&quot; says one StateDepartment official.   The 15 men are serving sentences for the December 1983bombings of the U.S. and French embassies and other targetsin Kuwait City that killed six people and injured about 60.   The Kuwaiti ruling family had refused to release theprisoners, despite recent appeals from Iranian officialseager to end the hostage crisis in order to rebuild ties tothe West and gain financing for reconstruction in the wake oftheir country's war with Iraq. One reason, U.S. officialssay, is that the conservative Kuwaiti rulers agreed with theU.S. policy of refusing concessions to the hostage-holders.Another was that the terrorists had tried to overthrow theKuwait government and rouse the country's large Shiitepopulation to rebellion.   U.S. intelligence analysts believe that anyIraqi-controlled regime could be just as likely as Kuwait tokeep the Shiite prisoners in jail, or even kill them. TheDa'wa party has actively opposed Saddam Hussein's regime andcarried out killings and terrorism within Iraq as well asKuwait, with the aim of establishing an Iran-style IslamicRepublic in Baghdad. Saddam Hussein's regime is made up ofminority Sunni Moslems ruling a majority Shiite population.   In addition, Mr. Hussein would be eager to prevent Iranfrom ending the hostage crisis and possibly improvingrelations with the West.   But Mr. Hussein might also use the prisoners as abargaining chip to exercise influence over Iran or the U.S.He could release them, as Iran wishes, in return forconcessions from Tehran, such as support for his new puppetregime in Kuwait, whose ruling family was hated in Tehran. Orhe could threaten to execute or harm them, placing the U.S.hostages in danger of retaliation, in an effort to blackmailthe Bush administration.   For its part, Iran might be prompted to step up itspressure on the kidnappers to free the six Americans, toseize an opportunity to gain Western sympathy.</TEXT></DOC>
