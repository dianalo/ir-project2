As Members of Congressplow through its hundreds of pages, many are becoming worriedover its impact on the economy. When as part of the budgetnegotiations, the idea for a 5% energy tax floated out of thebudget summit, Rep. John Dingell, co-chairman of theconference committee, quickly told negotiators the Clean AirAct already represented a hefty tax on energy.   The Bush Administration also has begun to recognize thecosts that the Clean Air Act would impose on the economy.Last month, Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush'sCouncil of Economic Advisers, responded to congressionalquestions about claims from the Environmental ProtectionAgency that the act would have little adverse job impact.&quot;The President's support for this proposal was not premisedon the view that its costs would be negligible. He is fullyaware they may result in temporary unemployment,&quot; he wrote.&quot;Rather, the President believes that our nation is able andshould be willing to pay a reasonable price to clean its air.But the President is not prepared to see American firms,workers and consumers overcharged or to see economic growthneedlessly slowed.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It is now clear that is precisely what the Clean Air Actwill do. A single provision requiring the use of gasoline andalcohol blends in 25% of the country will add 15 cents to 25cents a gallon to the price of gasoline. A study by TomAustin, a former executive officer of the California AirResources Board, concludes that the reformulated fuel will be15% less fuel-efficient and could actually increasenitrogen-oxide emissions. &quot;Motorists would end up paying morefor dirtier air,&quot; he says. A study by Resources for theFuture, a leading environmental group, also questions the useof alternative fuels. It estimates that reducing emissionsthrough methanol use could cost $31,000 to $66,000 a ton.   Other provisions of the Clean Air Act make just as littleeconomic sense. Its crash program of installing limestonescrubbers on old power plants to reduce acid rain will havethe perverse effect of delaying the installation of cleancoal technology. The bill will divert at least $50 billion incapital to install a 20-year-old technology and add topollution by leaving behind tons of limestone sludge a year.   After studying what the congressional process did to thePresident's proposal to create a system of tradable emissionspermits to reduce acid rain, analysts at WashingtonUniversity concluded that &quot;the Senate has created a RubeGoldberg scheme for distributing emissions allowances.&quot; BothHouse and Senate versions have eviscerated the intendedsavings from a tradable-permits system.   The Clean Air Act's fast phase-out of chlorofluorocarbonsuses the most tentative of scientific research on ozonedepletion to justify a dramatic increase in air-conditioningand refrigeration costs. The likely substitute for the mostpopular banned refrigerant costs 30 times as much and willitself be banned by the year 2015. The economy will have toshoulder at least $10 billion to $15 billion a year in addedrefrigeration costs by the year 2000.   Members of Congress tell us privately that the Clean AirAct was rushed to passage because no one wanted to publiclyoppose any bill with the words &quot;clean air&quot; in it. The BushAdministration was then rolled in private negotiations withenvironmental extremists, and then backed off from itsthreats to veto an outrageous bill. These are hardly excusesfor enacting a public policy that drapes significantfinancial weights on an economy trying to compete globally.</TEXT></DOC>
