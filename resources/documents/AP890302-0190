ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A witness in Oliver North's criminal trialtestified Thursday he heard North suggest at a meeting of Nicaraguanrebels that they open a new military front and block a governmentsupply route by sinking a barge in a river.   ``Basically,'' said Rafael Quintero, ``North ran the meeting.''   North, who was an aide to then-President Reagan's NationalSecurity Council, is on trial on 12 criminal charges. One accusationis that he drafted letters to Congress saying he had no involvementin the Contra effort to overthrow the leftist Nicaraguan governmentat a time when U.S. law prohibited official aid to the rebels.   The meeting, in a Miami Airport hotel room, was in June 1985,Quintero testified. North is accused of lying to Congress in 1985and 1986 by denying involvement.   The defense, in its questions, brought out testimony fromQuintero about many contacts he said he had with CIA peoplestationed in Central America and with military officials incountries in the area _ questioning intended to convey to the jurythat there was widespread involvement by the U.S. government in theContra supply effort.   For example, Quintero said whenever he entered El Salvador he hadto clear with the U.S. military commander there ``every step of theoperation'' and ``basically everything that was to be done inSalvador had to be done through him.''   The sixth witness in the trial, following Quintero, was RichardB. Gadd, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who said he arrangedfor aircraft to carry military goods covertly to the Contras at therequest of a North colleague, retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord.   He was still being questioned by prosecutor Michael Bromwich whenU.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell dismissed the jury untilMonday. Friday will be devoted to legal arguments on whether newrules are required for handling classified documents.   Also on Friday, U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson will sentenceNorth's one-time boss, former National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane, who pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors involvingwithholding information from Congress. McFarlane, who is scheduledas a witness at the North trial, asked to be sentenced before hetestified.   Quintero said participants at the meeting in Miami discussedopening a southern front as a way of getting the Sandinistas to drawaway some of the 60,000 Sandinista troops from the Honduran borderin the north. And the possibility was raised of obstructing the RamaRiver where, the witness said, 80 percent of the Sandinistas'supplies crossed.   He used a map and pointer while he spoke and North, who had neverbefore moved from the defense table during testimony, crossed theroom so that he could follow the demonstration.   ``Who suggested obstructing the river?'' asked prosecution lawyerMichael Bromwich.   ``Mr. North did,'' said Quintero.   Also attending the meeting, he said, were Contra leaders AdolfoCalero and Enrique Bermudez as well as Secord and an associateThomas Clines, an ex-CIA official. Both Secord and his associatewere involved in obtaining arms and shipping them to the Contras.   Quintero, testifying under immunity from prosecution, said he gotinvolved in the covert Contra activities through a call from Secord.   He described himself as ``a combination soldier and logisticsexpert'' who fought in the revolution that overthrew FulgencioBatista in Cuba. He said he became disenchanted when Fidel Castroallied himself with the Soviet Union. Quintero said he came to theUnited States, was trained by the CIA and was back in Cuba to workwith the resistance in the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that failed.   His mission in the North operation, he said, ``was to help theContras stay alive for the priod of time until Congress resumed aidto the Nicaraguan Contras.'' He was hired, at $4,000 a month, plus abonus for each shipment of arms he got to the Contras. He made 16trips to Central America from January to June 1986 to overseeconstruction of an airstrip to be used for the southern militaryfront.   Quintero also testified he once heard North say that PresidentReagan backed clandestine efforts to resupply the Contras.   This was, Quintero said, at a 1986 meeting in El Salvador when ahigh Salvadoran official declared he ``was not going to stick hisneck out and have it cut off.''   ``Mr. North pointed out the president was very much aware of theefforts this high Salvadoran official was doing, that the presidentwanted these efforts to continue'' he added.   Speaking in heavily accented English, Quintero also told ofanother time _ early 1986 in El Salvador _ when North helped settlea dispute between Contra factions over which should receive airdrops of supplies.   North decreed that Col. James Steele, former commander of U.S.forces in El Salvador, and Joe Fernandez, CIA station chief in CostaRica, should have the final word, Quintero said.   The testimony was elicited from Quintero by the prosecution in aneffort to show North exercised much control in the Contra fight fromhis post in the White House complex. North has said everything hedid was with approval from superiors.</TEXT></DOC>
