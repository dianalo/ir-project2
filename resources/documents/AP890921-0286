SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investors who say they lost $250 million onjunk bonds sold by Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association sued the stateof California on Thursday, claiming state officials never shouldhave allowed the bond sale.   The suit alleges the Department of Corporations disregarded itsown findings and warnings by savings and loan regulators when itapproved the sale of bonds by Lincoln's parent company, AmericanContinental Corp.   It accuses top Department of Corporations officials, includingChristine Bender, the head of the department, of conflict ofinterest because of their ties to the law firm representing AmericanContinental, the Phoenix company that federal officials are suingfor $1.1 billion. American Continental is operating under Chapter 11of federal bankruptcy laws.   Bender, who once worked for the law firm, declined detailedcomment, but said, ``Our actions were appropriate, we think we didmore than what was required by the law, and we are persuaded that acourt will find in our favor.''   Attorney Joseph Cotchett added the state as a defendant in anOrange County Superior Court class-action suit filed on behalf of23,000 bondholders. The suit says many of the investors were elderlypeople who believed the bonds were insured because they werepurchased in Lincoln Savings offices.   The suit seeks return of the $250 million, unspecified punitivedamages and attorneys' fees.   Lincoln Savings is insolvent and has been seized by thriftregulators, with estimated losses to taxpayers running as high as$2.5 billion, the largest Sandamp;L bailout in history.   Federal thrift regulators have sued American Continentalofficials for $1.1 billion, with additional penalties that couldbring the total to $2.4 billion.   That suit accuses Lincoln officials of racketeering, insidertrading, illegal loans, sham real-estate and tax transactions, andthe fraudulent sale of Lincoln stock to employees of the parentcompany.   The Orange County suit, amended Thursday, says state regulatorshad enough documentation that they knew or should have known thatAmerican Continental was near collapse in 1986, when the regulatorsapproved the sale of $200 million in uninsured junk bonds known assubordinated debentures.   Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield securities usually offeredby companies with a great deal of debt on their books or in weakfinancial condition.   In addition, state officials approved the sale of $150 millionmore in American Continental junk bonds in 1988.   The suit says the bonds were extremely risky to investors becauseof American Continental's precarious financial condition, thecompany's speculative investment portfolio and ``the highprobability that the subordinated debentures would be sold topersons seeking to make federally insured deposits, and who wouldnot understand the risks of subordinated debentures.''   When a company goes bankrupt, holders of its junk bonds are amongthe last creditors to get paid.   The head of American Continental, Arizona businessman CharlesKeating, contributed $366,250 to California politicians from 1986 to1988, including $79,000 to Gov. George Deukmejian, most of it forhis 1986 re-election bid.   At a Department of Corporations meeting on the bond offering inMarch 1988, Los Angeles attorney Karl Samuelian, Deukmejian's chieffund raiser, personally represented American Continental. Themeeting helped lead to approval of the bond sale.   Bender once worked for Samuelian's firm.   Deukmejian spokesman Tom Beermann said Thursday that ``Mr.Keating was one of 56,000 individuals who contributed to thegovernor's re-election campaign. Campaign contributions in no wayinfluenced any action by the Deukmejian administration.''</TEXT></DOC>
