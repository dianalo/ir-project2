 12-16) followed the Windows '90 show (Aug.andP;  15-17) inBoston by three months...but what a difference]  The biggest surprise atComdex was in the WordPerfect booth.andP;  Not only had the beta version of thisWindows word processing program been substantially enhanced, but the 'floorpitch' from those giving demos had changed.andP;  In Boston WordPerfect made a bigdeal out of keystroke compatibility with DOS WordPerfect.andP;  The message: we'vestill got all those wonderful WordPerfect keys you users know and love...andP;  InVegas, on the other hand, we say an application tuned for Windows with visualfile viewers and management.andP;  WordPerfect for Windows has graphic editingtools, a button bar, and is very iconic.andP;  (Look for it in 2Q 91.)andP;  And thephrase 'keystroke compatibility' wasn't uttered once]andM;Yes, keystroke compatibility is there--if you need it.andP;  Maybe WordPerfect(unlike Lotus) finally figured out the score.andP;  Nobody cares about keystrokecompatibility in a point-and-click Windows environment]  Except for keying incopy, the Windows crowd doesn't use keyboards all that much]andM;At the same time other vendors on the floor or behind the scenes were showingprograms that were keystroke driven (like Lotus).andP;  Obviously, these folkshaven't done their homework like WordPerfect.andM;People who saw WordPerfect in Boston and shrugged their shoulders weresaying, &quot;Hey, this program has things in it that Samna's Ami and Microsoft'sWord doesn't have.andP;  WordPerfect will probably give Microsoft a realrun forits money.&quot;andP;  For example, WordPerfect lets you pick any pulldown menuselection and turn it into a icon...sort of a cross between Word'sruler/ribbon and Ami Pro's icon's down-the-side.andP;  Another example: You mightpull down the file menu, select a frequently used command, and add it toWordPerfect's 'button bar' series of icons.andP;  You chose the features you use alot and install them on the button bar.andP;  (With Word, what's on the ribbon iswhat you get...period.)andP;  Even more clever is the fact that WordPerfect letsyou decide where you want the buttons--across the top of the screen (likeWord) or down the side (like Ami Pro).andP;  Also, there are three different waysto display the functions you pick.andP;  You get to decide whether the 'buttons'are displayed as icons, text-plus-icon, or text only (for Luddites who likewords better than pictures).andP;  This gimmick should challenge both Word and AmiPro.andM;Another really clever feature: WordPerfect's current DOS version has a filemanager that can be used instead of the DOS shell i.e., hit the right key(F5) and you bring up a file list from that subdirectory which you can copy,delete, etc.andP;  The Windows version accomplishes the same thing (only better)via a Multiple Document Display.andP;  DOS-like file names appear in one windowwhie a second window actually shows you the file.andP;  (Kind of a Lotus Magellanunder DOS.)andP;  The beta version we saw only supported two formats: WordPerfectDocument (WPD) and WordPerfect Graphic (WPG), but the company promises to addviewers for nearly everything else before the product ships.andP;  This is slick.andO;The competition doesn't offer a good, Magellan-like program.andP;  Access Softekoffers a browser, but it's buggy and costs extra.andP;  WordPerfect, on the otherhand, will include a browser as part of its word processing package.andP;  Thereare probably a lot of people who want a word processor and would like to havethe browse capabilities.andP;  With WordPerfect for Windows, they'll get both.andM;All in all, WordPerfect for windows will rock Microsoft's boat.andP;  But thefolks from Utah could have had a real killer application.andP;  How?andP;  The DOS andWindows versions of WordPerfect offer limited graphic abilities--you can takea graphic and rotate it, etc.andP;  The new MAC version (WordPerfect 2.0), on theother hand, has an extremely capable set of drawing and graphicstools...basically a nice illustration and drawing package.andP;  Wouldn't addingthose MAC-like drawing tools to the Windows version blow Microsoft Word away?andM;It won't happen because WordPerfect says it plans to compete againstMicrografx Designer and Corel Draw by introducing &quot;DrawPerfect&quot; for Windowsin late '91 or early '92]  (What do the folks in Utah use for brains thesedays?)andP;  Further out in the plan is a Windows version of WordPerfect Office.andM;Samna's Ami Pro was on display in the Lotus booth.andP;  The Pamphlets had thelotus logo, with a line at the bottom explaining that an acquisition wasunderway and soon Samna 'may' be part of Lotus.andP;  (After the Novell deal fellthrough, I guess Lotus isn't too sure of anything any more])  It was obviousLotus was excited about Ami Pro.andM;Also on view was Lotus 123/G for OS/2, Notes, and Freelance Graphics forOS/2, the drawing program Lotus plans to introduce later this year.andO;Freelance is similar to Microsoft's Powerpoint: drawing tools on the right.andO;Freelance, however does not have an outliner, a major miscalculation onLotus' part.andP;  Microsoft's Powerpoint for Windows has no outliner, becausePowerpoint for the MAC doesn't have one.andP;  Micrografx' Charisma doesn't haveone either.andP;  But Aldus will have to offer an outliner in the Windows versionof Persuasion because its MAC version has one.andP;  And then outlining willbecome a mandatory feature of this product category.andP;  (Oh well, some are bornto leadandgt; others to follow.)andM;Outlining is essential.andP;  People who do presentations and give speeches wantto be finished fast.andP;  Persuasion on the MAC lets you type copy, hit theindent key, and be done.andP;  Once you've used an outliner, going into a productlike Powerpoint or Freelance and messing around with tab settings is a realwaste of time.andM;Will Lotus do a Windows version of Freelance?andP;  We asked at the booth and theanswer was &quot;Someday.&quot;andP;  Lotus is still developing for OS/2 first, Windowslater.andP;  (In fact, they plan an OS/2 version of Improv first.)andP;  Wake up andsmell the roses, guys.andP;  It's 1991andgt; look at Windows 3.0 sales]andM;Interestingly, IBM's Desktop Software Group (which publishes Current) is nothandicapped (as the PS/2 group is) by a requirement to publish on OS/2version first.andP;  In fact, IBM's Desktop Software Group has acquired rights toXywrite and will publish a Windows and a DOS version.andP;  They expect to dumpIBM's Display Write...and good riddance]  (Maybe IBM's PS/2 group has becomea non-profit organization and didn't tell anyone])andM;The other truly impressive product at Comdex was Corel Draw 2.0.andP;  It's reallybeefed up.andP;  Corel added an amazing 50 more outline fonts and the ability toexport its font outlines in the Adobe Type I format.andP;  This means you can useCorel Draw with things like ATM for Windows, and Zenographics Superprint.andO;Corel also has a series of font conversion utilities that bring in fonts fromother vendors.andP;  Run them through the WFNBOS utility, and voila--Adobe Type Ifonts.andP;  A series of manipulations let you turn, bend, and twist text.andP;  Avisual file manager called Mosaic has been added, and the trace utility hasbeen beefed up--it can now do greyscale and 24-bit color tracing.andP;  And allthis is part of a $95 upgrade]  What's more, Corel Draw still has all thethings people liked about it in the first place--the easy-to-use interface,the speed, the training video.andP;  In fact, the only thing Corel Draw doesn't doanymore is give away free keychains.andP;  They gave the last of them away at theSeybold show.andM;In the competing camp, all Micrografx had to show off was DrawPlus 1.1--whichis the current product marked for Windows 3.0 with some additional clipart.andO;(The Grayson brothers were throwing in some Christmas cipart--if you boughtbefore the end of 1990.)andP;  Is there any doubt Corel will continue to dominatethe drawing category?andM;Shareware SmartsandM;Plenty of revamped Shareware was in evidence this year.andP;  Peter Sills made asmart move after leaving Echelon.andP;  Sills bought the rights to a nifty littleshareware screen-saver with rotating wallpaper called Screen Piece, enchancedit, and renamed it Intermission.andP;  We believe Sills stands to make a lot ofmoney for himself and Icom.andM;Icom Simultions, Inc., 648 S. Wheeling Rd., Wheeling, IL 60090andgt; 708/520-4440.andM;Similarly, Berkeley Systems bought the rights to Magic, another sharewarescreen-saver popular on Compuserve.andP;  Magic is still being reworked and is inbeta test.andP;  We can't talk about it yet because of nondisclosure agreements,but look for it soon as After Dark for Windows.andP;  Berkeley is planning to takeall their MAC screen-savers and move them onto the After Dark engine.andM;Berkely Systems, 1700 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, CA 94709andgt; 415/540-5535.andM;Then there are the iconic shareware products that hit the libraries ofCompuServe with a bang.andP;  We expected to see a commercial program emerge sincepart of the fun of Windows 3.0 is designing icons, or taking icons alreadyavailable, bringing them in through the clipboard, and jazzing them up withcolor, etc.andM;We were beginning to think the Windows crowd was asleep at the wheel.andP;  ThenhDC announced Icon Designer, a pop-up utility for creating icons for WindowsProgram Manager.andP;  This is a natural, since the company has all those niftyicons in hDC Express.andM;At Comdex hDC previewed FileApp, a a set of five pop-up utilities formanipulating files.andP;  File Apps has undelete, a browse capability, filesearch, etc.andP;  just like the windows File Manager...except it goes alonginside your Windows applications--a sort of File Manager in a suitcase.andP;  Ifyou're in the middle of an Excel session and accidentally undeleted afile,click on the red hDC icon.andP;  No more closing down Excel and running tothe Windows File Manager for help.andM;FileApps should have a great future.andP;  Corporate users who substitute aWindows shell (like Command Post) replace the Windows File Manager create anon-standard environment.andP;  FileApps does not replace the Windows FileManager.andM;As for functionality, hDC's file undelete provides an actual file name (not aquestionmark and first character like Norton Utilities does).andP;  File Appsoffers lots of color, good icons, good 'Help', and is really easy to use.andM;One thing developers haven't picked up on yet is hDC's Micro Apps developmentkit currently in beta test.andP;  This product will debut in 1Q 91 and sell for$995--more than the sDK, but not a lot of money.andP;  This is afill-in-the-blanks template and could cut development time for a Windowsutility by at least six months.andP;  (In fact, that's why the folks at TravelingSoftware managed to get WinConnect out the door so fast.)andP;  This is a greatlittle tool.andP;  Currently about 20 sites are working with it--and they aresplit 50-50 between ISVs and corporate accounts]andM;MicroApps SDK sells for under $1000 and provide a template approach toutilities.andP;  Launch them from any application just by pointing on the cutelittle red hDC icon.andP;  Since hDC is trying not to expand the beta group toofast, get in on the action while you can.andP;  The MicroApp architecture hasgreat potential.andP;  In fact, MicroApps are central to hDC's strategy--unlessMicrosoft builds something just like it into Windows.andM;hDC is working on other things besides MicroApps and Icon Designer.andP;  Expectanother wave of applications to follow close behind.andP;  This company is reallyhustling.andM;hDC Computer Corp., 6742 185th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052andgt; 800/321-4606.andM;In contrast, Publishing Technologies, author of the PubTech File Organizerand CBM Desktop Office seem to have lost momentum.andP;  It's products competedirectlywith hDCs.andP;  But it still doesn't 't have Multitack under Windows 3,and the PubTech tools shown last year still looke rough.andP;  A year ago wethought Publishing Technologies would be the company doing high poweredapplicatons while hDC stuck to cute little toys like hDC Card Designer andRocks.andM;What's ironic about products like hDC File Apps and ThreadZ (another MicroApp-type product) is that both are offering a file undelete for Windows longbefore the DOS utilities king--Peter Norton.andP;  There are corporate computertypes who prefer to wait.andP;  Meanwhile small Windows compinies like these arescooping the big guys.andP;  (Of course, if you'd rather wait go ahead.andP;  But youmay give up long before Norton arrives])andM;Pubishing Technologies Inc., 7719 Wood Hollow Drive, Ste 260, Austin, TX78731andgt; 512-346-2835.andM;Another product worth noting at Comdex was WinConnect from TravelingSoftware.andP;  WinConnect allows a laptop to connect to a PC running Windows forthe purpose of sharing or transfering files--a kind of Windows Laplink.andO;WinConnect uses another hDC MicroApp called File Enhancer--or you can use theWindows File ManageR.andP;  Traveling Software uses a new file compressiontechnology called TSK that moves data at 7 Mbytes per minute, about twice asfast as most other transfer technologies.andP;  Under a colicensing agreement withhDC, WinConnect will be included with hDC's MicroApps--but you still have tobuy the cable.andP;  (Laplink's cable doesn't work, we're told.)andP;  With this deal,Traveling Software is going to sell a lot of cables]andM;Traveling Software, 18702 North Creek Pkwy, Bothell, WA 98011andgt; 206/483-8088andM;Coming AttractionsandM;With the exception of Wordperfect's Windows word procesor (not yet in betatest), few big companies were courageous enough to show what they were doing.andO;For many major players it's still too early.andP;  Semantec/Peter Norton say theyplan to introduce ten products in 1991, half of them for Windows.andP;  (Theydidn't say which would come from Semantec and which from Norton, however.)andO;Borland showed the Paradox engine for Windows and a prototype C Sharp.andP;  AndLotus didn't show 1,2,3 for Windows on the show floor at all.andM;Then there was ThreadZ headed by software author Art Metz.andP;  ThreadZ competesdirectly with hDC's Micro Apps.andP;  Also, things appear to be sticky betweenthese two since ThreadZ is made up of ex-hDC people who hired Metz to revamphis shareware.andP;  The ThreadZ file manager is a commercial version of the ArtMetz' Windows shell and contains a directory, a file search, and areplacement for task manager.andP;  Like hDC, ThreadZ has a Windows undelete.andP;  Oneproblem: Nobody's heard of ThreadZ]andM;ThreadZ Software, 4018 148th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052-5516andgt; 206/869-6292.andM;Roycore has changed the name of its organizational charting program fromORGCharter--to Instant ORGCharting.andP;  (Boy, what an ORGasm.)andP;  This product iseven easier to use than ABC Flowcharter: start the program and the firstsquare comes up automatically along with a series of arrows (to the left, tothe right, and down).andP;  You click a direction, it draws the next box, and soon.andP;  When it comes to filling in data you double-click on a box, it opens andprompts for the person's name and title.andP;  If you want to add more,a dialogbox lets you configure the data.andP;  When you're finished you get a little toolpalette that lets you customize and add auxiliary dotted lines.andP;  Then a handicon lets you change the chart around.andP;  An optimize mode downscaleseverything to squeeze more into those tiny little boxes.andP;  Plus there'sportrait and landscape modes--all in a $149 product.andP;  Not bad]  Look for itin March.andM;Asymetrix announced it would do a version of Toolbook for OS/2 that would be&quot;slightly slower&quot; than the Windows version.andP;  We dindn't think anything couldbe slower than the Windows version.andP;  Despite distressing performance, weexpect Toolbook to dominate the object-oriented authoring field.andP;  We saw fourToolbook 'Books' at the Asymetrix booth including Scrap Book from PublishedPerfection.andP;  Created by an artist with zero programming experience, ScrapBook is clipart and makes a really nice shell for launching desktoppublishing applications.andP;  It's not slow because Scrap Book is done inblack-and-white.andP;  (Color brings Toolbook to its knees.)andM;Published Perfection, 7486 La Jolla blvd, Ste 552, La Jolla, CA 92037andgt;619-546-9302.andM;Now that we think about it, when Spinnaker was working on Plus the companycautioned about using color because there was a real speed penalty.andP;  This isunfortunate because most people with Windows have color.andP;  And who wants ablack-and-white stack?andP;  Asymetrix, on the other hand, has been telling peoplefor ayear that OS/2 would solve the performance problem because it was asuperior operating system.andM;Plus is faster than Toolbook in some areasandgt; slower in others.andP;  Plus'advantage is that the same product resides on Windows and in the MAC makingit a great cross-compatibility tool if you're moving things back and forth.andO;Spinnaker promises that as long as you have no MAC-specific externals builtin, Plus can take a MAC stack and run it under Windows.andM;Spinnaker Software Corp., 201 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02139andgt; 617/494-1200.andM;Matesys is shipping Object Script.andP;  Also, it bought the commercial rights toTwinTalk.andP;  (Not Twin the spreadsheet.)andP;  TwinTalk is a French sharewarepackage.andP;  In fact, the first version to hit U.S.andP;  bulletin boards was inFrench so it wasn't terribly useful.andP;  Now it's been translated.andP;  Instead of'nag ware'--the shareware logo that pops up and reminds you to pay up--theylimited the program to 10 minutes.andP;  This really limited its use.andP;  How manypeople sign onto CompuServe fo r10 minutes?andP;  So Matesys saw the product,bought the rights, and started enhancing it.andP;  It will be called Object Tell.andO;Why use an Object (something) name for a communicatons product with noscripting language?andP;  Well, all Matesys' products will be caledObject-something-or-other.andM;Matesys Corp., NAH, 3 Bethesda Metro Ctr, Ste 700, Bethesda, MD 20814andgt;301/652-2241.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
