Taxicab drivers stopped work on Tuesday in Managua and threeother major cities _ Leon, Granada and Masaya _ to protestgovernment measures that doubled the price of gasoline and devaluedthe national currency by half.   The austerity measures by the leftist Sandinista government wereaimed at combating inflation.   The cabbies, who steered clear of calling their action a strike,formed a panel that started negotiations with government officialsover a list of demands.   On Monday, Ortega ordered the sharpest currency devaluation sofar this year, causing prices to skyrocket. The 52 percentdevaluation brought down the cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, from9,500 to the U.S. dollar Friday to 20,000 per dollar on Monday.   That kicked off a massive rise in prices for everything, fromfood and transportation to clothing, services and entertainment.   Food prices doubled and markets emptied. Cab drivers doubledtheir fares but found few takers.   Ortega said Tuesday that Nicaragua will have to import basicfoods in June and July, and will further restrict the financing ofinvestments.   He had announced on Monday a 110 percent rise in the price ofgasoline _ from 17,700 cordobas a gallon to 37,200 cordobas.   The president said then there would be no further devaluations inthe cordoba this month. He also said he hoped to halt black marketspeculation in dollars that he said fuels inflation.   Bus fares on routes within Managua went up from 500 to 750Cordobas overnight and dozens of people on Tuesday hitched ridesfrom private car owners saying they couldn't afford the new fares.Most cabs emptied after the fares doubled.   Sales also dropped in food markets after prices shot up followingthe devaluation.   Ortega said the nation's 43,000 public school teachers and healthworkers will get a 50 percent pay raise to make up for losses toinflation. Teachers also will receive a 14 percent increase thatOrtega promised May 20 after several schools were shut down bywildcat strikes.   An additional 87,000 government employees will receive a 36percent pay raises, retroactive to June 1, Ortega said.   Speaking on government television, Ortega said businessmen werefueling cost of living increases by speculating in dollars.   ``Over these last few weeks a great deal of money has been movingin the speculative markets. And over the last few days there hasbeen a massive withdrawal of savings in order to speculate,'' hesaid.   Inflation was 15.5 percent in May. The cost of living rose 20,000percent last year.   The government has said that an austerity program launched inJanuary has checked hyperinflation. But the program also brought arecession.   Nicaragua, traditionally a food exporter to the rest of CentralAmerica, will have to import basic foods such as tomatoes, onions,bananas and cabbages in June and July to make up for domesticshortages, Ortega said.   To stimulate production, the government has been giving financialincentives to agricultural producers, who began their seasonalplantings in May. But lack of rain destroyed seeds already plantedand many fields had to be planted again, an extra expense theeconomy can ill afford.</TEXT></DOC>
