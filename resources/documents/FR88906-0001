Spencer, (202) 632-6817.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In 1979, OPM used the authority grantedby the Civil Service Reform Act to delegate to agencies authority to approvevarious personnel actions that previously had to be approved by OPM. Someof these authorities were delegated directly, but others required agenciesto negotiate delegation agreements.On April 21, 1988 (53 FR 13124), OPM issued proposed regulations eliminatingthe requirement for agencies to have delegation agreements in order toexercise several commonly used authorities. Most agencies have had agreementscovering those authorities for several years and have used the authoritiesproperly. The reporting requirements contained in the agreements merelycreate an unnecessary paperwork burden. The limits on agencies' delegatedauthority previously contained in delegation agreements will be includedin applicable regulations and FPM instructions to ensure that extreme oratypical cases are reviewed and approved by OPM.Comments on the proposed regulations were received from nine Federal agenciesand one employee organization, which all supported the proposal. The employeeorganization suggested, however, that the regulations provide appeal proceduresfor employees who believe an agency's decision is improper. We did notadopt this suggestion because the authorities being delegated do not involvethe types of actions (separation, furlough, loss of grade or pay) thatare subject to appeal. Rather, the authorities involve new appointments,promotions, or reassignments. Candidates for new appointment have no appealrights since they can decline an employment offer they find unsatisfactory.Procedures used to select employees for promotion or reassignment are subjectto grievance procedures (although nonselection by itself may not usuallybe the basis for a complaint). Employees who believe the authorities toestablish training agreements or waive time in grade requirements are beingimproperly applied have recourse through the grievance process. Based on the favorable reaction, OPM is adopting the proposed delegations,as follows:<T3>Waiver of time in grade requirements based on undue hardship or inequity(5 CFR 300.603).</T3> An agency head or his or her designee (who may beat any organizational level) may waive time in grade requirements to permitpromotion of no more than three grades in an individual case that meetsthe definitions of hardship or inequity contained in the regulation. Allwaivers involving promotions or more than three grades must be approvedby OPM.<T3>Appointments above the minimum rate in grades GS-11 and above basedon the appointees' superior qualifications (5 CFR 531.203(b)).</T3> Agenciesmay establish salaries under this regulation that do not exceed the candidates'existing pay by more than 20 percent. Rates exceeding that limit must beapproved by OPM.<T3>Training agreements.</T3> Agencies may develop and implement plansunder which intensive training is to be used as a substitute for time ingrade requirements, as long as the plans do not permit consecutive acceleratedpromotions of any trainees. Plans providing for consecutive acceleratedpromotions will continue to require OPM approval.OPM is also issuing an FPM letter delegating to agencies: (1) Authorityto approve training agreements under which intensive training may be substitutedfor normal qualification requirements; and (2) authority to approve paymentof candidates' travel expenses for interviews when a position at gradeGS-10 or above is so unique in terms of its duties, responsibilities, and/orperformance requirements that a preemployment interview is necessary fora final determination of applicants' qualifications. Specific conditionsfor use of those authorities and additional instructions and guidance onuse of the authorities delegated by these regulations are set out in theFPM letter.All actions taken under the delegated authorities must be consistent withinstructions set out in the regulations and FPM, with merit promotion policy,and with other applicable laws and requirements. OPM will retain oversightresponsibility and may review agencies' use of the delegated authoritiesduring personnel management evaluations. OPM may suspend or withdraw anagency's or organization's delegated authority if the organization's useof the authority is inconsistent with merit principles or if a patternof error or misuse shows that the organization cannot manage the delegatedauthority successfully. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because the regulations affectonly the procedures used to appoint and assign certain Federal employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>5 CFR Part 300Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees.5 CFR Part 531Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, wages.<ITAG tagnum="20">Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending 5 CFR Parts 300 and 531 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 300_EMPLOYMENT (GENERAL)</ITAG>1.
