Firmly, clearly and unequivocally, we must say to SaddamHussein: Let our people go. Let Kuwait go. And if you start a war,know that we will finish it.   We have learned before that the large conflicts which engulf theworld begin from small and unanswered aggressions. If the civilizedworld had looked the other way, the Iraqi war machine could haverolled across the Arabian Peninsula. It would be only a matter oftime until Iraq had ballistic missiles with chemical, biologicaland nuclear warheads that could reach Israel, Egypt and Europeitself.   But this time, other nations have acted in time.   Among them is the Soviet Union, a nation we did not often praisein the years of the Cold War. From the summit at Helsinki, wherePresident Gorbachev and President Bush stood in common purpose, wecould see beyond the present shadows of war in the Middle East to anew world order where the strong work together to deter and stopaggression.   This was precisely Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill'svision of peace for the post-war period. Their hope, suspended intime for fifty years of Cold War, has come alive in this new,post-Communist era.   America is still the leader _ the only power capable ofsummoning a grand and global alliance on the scale we have seen inOperation Desert Shield. But it is not enough for other nationsjust to share our commitment. They must also share the burden.   When Bangladesh is putting troops in harm's war, so should ourpowerful and prosperous allies.   When Japan, Germany, and other NATO countries depend far moreheavily of Mideast oil than we do, they can and should contributeto defend their own vital interests in the Persian Gulf.   When countries like Egypt can stand beside us, when youngAmericans stand on front lines, only miles from the threat ofpoison gas, the least the Japanese and Germans can do is support us_ and not just with words; they must respond to our potentialsacrifice of lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their own.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
