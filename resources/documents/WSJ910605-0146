According to a person close to the company, Unisys hasposted notices or held meetings at numerous plants andoffices asking employees to volunteer to take severancepackages and leave the company. The person said Unisys hasindicated at some sites that volunteers must come forward byFriday. After that, Unisys will decide how many employees itmust lay off.</LP><TEXT>   Based on the cost-cutting goals that Unisys describedinternally, the person said the number of jobs to be cut willhave to be in the thousands. That would be on top of programsthat are expected to cut employment to less than 70,000 byyear end, from 93,000 at the beginning of 1989 and 120,000 atthe time of the merger of Burroughs Corp. with Sperry Corp.to form Unisys 4 1/2 years ago.   In Blue Bell, Pa., a Unisys spokesman didn't deny thatlayoffs might occur, but he said no decisions have yet beenmade. He said the company has been reviewing for some timemany ways to cut costs, noting that Chairman James Unruh toldthe annual meeting in April that Unisys' costs were still toohigh and that some plants might have to be closed.   While Unisys has hacked away at costs for 2 1/2 years now,it hasn't been able to move fast enough to counteract thestagnation of revenue growth. Despite all the plant closingsat Unisys, one former executive said few plants are operatingat more than 50% of capacity; the Unisys spokesman called thefigure speculative. With the company's debt load stayingstubbornly large, losses have totaled $1.2 billion since thebeginning of 1989, and many securities analysts expect thecompany to lose money again this year.   As previously reported, Unisys also may have to open talkswith its banks soon, because it is in danger of violating anet-worth covenant of an important credit agreement.   Unisys has introduced a number of products lately, notablya high-end mainframe and a cluster of mainframes that canprocess transactions at high speed while almost eliminatingthe downtime that is usually required for maintenance of suchsystems. But the economy and concern about Unisys' futurehave damped demand. The company also has been frustrated inits attempts to make a major asset sale that would let it cutthe $3.87 billion debt load that is a legacy from itsattempts to expand rapidly.   While the stock has languished as a result, it did climb50 cents to $4.25 on heavy volume of 1.9 million sharesyesterday in composite trading on the New York StockExchange.</TEXT></DOC>
