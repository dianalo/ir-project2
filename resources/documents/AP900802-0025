SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush, proposing an orderly,long-term reduction in the nation's military arsenal, is backing a25 percent cut in the armed forces by the mid-1990s, administrationand Pentagon sources say.   Bush was slated to make the proposal in a speech today in Aspen,Colo., as his $307 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991 has comeunder severe attack on Capitol Hill.   ``The president will lay out the broad outlines of his newstrategy for the nation's defenses and how our military mustrespond, based on the changes in the world that have occurred,''said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   In a speech to the Aspen Institute, Bush planned to offersupport for two hotly debated weapons programs _ the B-2 stealthbomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative _ and support a 25percent cut in the armed forces by the end of 1995, the source said.   A similar cut in the nation's arsenal of troops and weapons waslaid out by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as an option for budgetnegotiators in June, but it was derided as ``overly cautious'' bycritics seeking additional budget savings.   Bush planned to make the address after conferring with BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Aspen. It will be the fourthtime Bush and Mrs. Thatcher have met in as many months.   Bush's speech comes two days after the House Armed ServicesCommittee cut $24 billion from the $307 billion the president hadrequested for defense spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   The panel voted to halt production of the B-2 bomber and slashedalmost $2 billion from Bush's request of $4.7 billion from theanti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as StarWars. It also cut military personnel by 129,500 and scaled back ontwo nuclear missile programs.   In June, Cheney said a 25 percent force reduction could save$8.6 billion over five years as the Pentagon retired six activeduty Army divisions, 111 Navy ships and 11 Air Force tacticalfighter wings, and removed 442,000 men and women from themilitary's 2.1-million-member active duty ranks.   Appearing Wednesday evening on public television's``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour,'' the defense secretary hinted that evenmore changes could be in store. He said he had ``new baseclosings'' to announce, possibly as early as next week.   But Cheney also complained that while the House wanted him tocut personnel, members were balking at closing unneeded bases.   Bush said on July 20 at a Strategic Air Command base inCheyenne, Wyo., that, ``We must have an orderly build-down, notsome kind of a fire sale'' in defense.   He indicated then that he could live with the $18 billion thatthe Senate Armed Services Committee voted to cut from his defensebudget, but he implored Congress to ``hold the line at (that)already painful reduction.''   The senior American official said the president's remarks wouldfollow along the lines of those made by Cheney and Gen. ColinPowell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Both have called repeatedly for an orderly, planned reduction introop strength so that the all-volunteer force is not gutted andmorale destroyed.   Powell has ordered a study to assess the ``base line force''that the nation needs to be a superpower, another source said.   Mrs. Thatcher is scheduled to address the closing session of theAspen Institute conference on Sunday. Like Bush, she is underpressure at home to deliver a peace dividend reflecting thechanging face of Europe and reduced East-West tensions.   While the United States grapples with how to reduce the Pentagonbudget, Mrs. Thatcher's defense secretary, Tom King, announcedplans last week to reduce the size of the British army by 25percent over five to seven years and cut its forces in West Germanyin half. King also outlined cuts in the British air force and navybut said Britain would retain its nuclear arsenal.   Cheney was flying separately to Aspen to attend the symposium atthe non-profit institute, marking its 40th anniversary of bringingpolitical, business and cultural leaders together to discuss globalissues.</TEXT></DOC>
