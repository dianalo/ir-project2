<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0449 </DOCNO><TEXT>Six iterative reconstruction methods appropriate for emission computedtomography were compared in regard to their algorithms. It was shownthat the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) method is classifiedin an algorithmic type similar to the Additive Simultaneous IterativeReconstruction Technique (ASIRT) method and the Gradient (GRADY) method,and that the Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm (ISRA) method has asimplified algorithm of the Multiplicative Simultaneous Iterative ReconstructionTechnique (MSIRT) method. The performances of the six methods were investigatedby computer simulation generating their iterative reconstruction imagesof a mathematical phantom. Four fitness functions were introduced toanalyze the convergence of the iterative reconstruction methods quantitatively.Each fitness function is a measure of the difference between the reconstructionimage and the mathematical phantom, or a measure of the rate of covergence.The EM method achieved faster convergence than the ASIRT method, whilethe ISRA method gave slower convergence than the MSIRT method. Of thesix methods, the fastest convergence was obtained using the ConjugateGradient (CONGR) method, and the slowest was the ISRA method. The characteristicsof each fitness function were also analyzed by its behavior as a functionof iteration number for the first 100 iterations of the six methods.These results suggest that the selection of the fitness function fora measure of the convergence is important to use any iterative reconstructionmethods.</TEXT></DOC>
