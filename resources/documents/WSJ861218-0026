Federal funds, which are reserves banks lend each other, traded between 7 1/2% and 8% for much of the session, compared with an average rate of 6.48% Tuesday. But bond prices generally wound up little changed in quiet trading.    The rise in short-term rates came despite an injection of reserves into the banking network by the Federal Reserve System. The federal funds rate often rises at this time of the year as technical pressures drain reserves from the banking system. Nevertheless, analysts were surprised at the extent of the rise.    Adding to the pressures on the funds rate was the fact that yesterday was the final day of the two-week bank reserve accounting period. The funds rate often swings widely on such days.    Jeffrey R. Leeds, a managing director of Chemical Bank's capital markets group, contended that the funds rate increase was merely a &quot;technical aberration.&quot; He said bond traders paid little attention to it partly because &quot;there seems to be a virtual unanimity in the marketplace that the economy is sluggish enough&quot; to persuade the Federal Reserve to lower its discount rate early next year. The discount rate, now 5 1/2%, is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Bond traders also were encouraged by the continued impasse at the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva, Switzerland. Earlier in the week, fears that OPEC would agree on a production-cutting accord that would drive up oil prices sent jitters through the bond markets.    Whatever the case, the high funds rate helped drive up other interest rates. For example, interest rates on some certificates of deposit issued by banks rose more than half a percentage point. Large-denominated CDs due in January were quoted at 6.85% bid, up from 6.3% Tuesday. Three-month certificates rose to 6.2% from 6%.    Bankers Trust Co. raised its broker loan rate to 8% from 7.25%. The rate is the fee that banks charge securities firms on loans backed by stock as collateral. Securities firms generally pass along increases in this rate to their customers buying stock on margin.    Analysts contended that the rise in the funds rate wasn't due to any changes in Federal Reserve credit policy. The Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, met Monday and Tuesday to plan credit strategy for the weeks ahead.    Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc., believes the Fed decided to leave policy unchanged. Fed officials will wait for additional evidence on the economy's health before easing credit policy further, he said. He predicted economic activity will slow in coming months, prompting the Fed to reduce the discount rate to 5 1/4% in next year's first quarter.    The economy is growing at only about a 1.9% annual rate this quarter, Mr. Stone estimated. He predicted the growth will slow to about 1.2% in the first quarter of 1987. The Commerce Department yesterday lowered its estimate of third-quarter economic growth slightly to 2.8% from the 2.9% reported last month.    William Griggs, an economist at Griggs andamp; Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm, contends the economy is growing at about a 3% clip this quarter. With that kind of growth, Fed officials won't be in any rush to ease credit policy, he said.    The government today is scheduled to release November figures on personal income and consumer spending. Mr. Griggs estimates that the figures will show personal income rose 0.7% last month compared with a 0.4% gain in October. He also estimates that personal consumption expenditures grew 0.9% in November, contrasting with October's 2% decline. That, he said, would suggest that the economy is doing &quot;pretty well&quot; this quarter.    Francis H. Schott, chief economist of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., expects continued economic growth next year. &quot;The good news is that I don't expect the economy to stumble into a recession,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;The not-so-good news is that we can look forward to, at best, another lackluster year.&quot;    Mr. Schott predicted 2.5% growth in 1987. He also said there is a &quot;better than average chance&quot; the Fed will cut its discount rate half a percentage point to 5% in the first quarter, with the banking industry's prime, or base, rate on corporate loans falling to 7% from 7.5%. &quot;Before year-end, however, we will see them scoot back up to today's levels,&quot; he contended.    In the credit markets, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose slightly to 101 14/32 from 101 12/32 Tuesday, leaving the yield unchanged at about 7.38%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose to 100 31/32 from 100 29/32, trimming the yield to 7.11% from 7.12%.    Elsewhere, prices of municipal bonds registered gains of as much as five-eighths of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. But corporate bond prices generally wound up little changed.    Trading activity in junk-bond issues, those with less than investment-grade ratings, was &quot;pretty slow,&quot; said James R. Caywood, president of Caywood-Christian Capital Management in San Diego, Calif. &quot;The junk bond market seems to have a slightly better tone but trading has been slowing down, as it usually does around the holidays.&quot;    Among short-term securities, the latest 13-week Treasury bill rose to 5.63% bid from 5.59% Tuesday. The bid on the latest 26-week bill increased to 5.6% from 5.58%.    In the new-issue market, a $100 million issue of PHH Group Inc. notes was offered to investors through a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. underwriting team. The 8% notes were priced at 99.875 to yield 8.02% to maturity in 10 years. They are rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
