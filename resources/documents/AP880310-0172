Using a new method of estimation, the survey concluded there isa 50-50 chance that undiscovered crude oil totals 33.4 billionbarrels, well below the 54.6 billion estimated in a 1981 study,according to figures provided to scientists at a research meetingin Denver last week.   Ozzie Girard, deputy assistant director for engineering geology,said Thursday the major part of the change came from disappointingdrilling results.   But some of the change results from a much lower priceprevailing over the last two years, when the latest work was done.The 1981 work assumed a price of $30 a barrel, while the new studyassumes a price of $18.   The Survey believes that the uncertainty of the estimates isjust as important as the estimates themselves. It said there is a90 percent chance that undiscovered oil lies between 19.6 billionbarrels and 51.9 billion barrels. That range in 1981 was 41.7billion barrels to 71 billion barrels.   The estimates do not include known reserves, outlined by actualdrilling, or probable reserves believed to be findable in oradjacent to a known field if new exploratory drilling wereundertaken. They also do not include oil and gas offshore.   The Minerals Management Service, which is preparing new offshoreestimates, three years ago lowered its estimate of offshore oilfrom 27 billion barrels to 12.2 billion.   Participants at the Denver meeting also were advised that thesurvey now estimates that reserves of undiscovered natural gas at254 trillion cubic feet, down from the previous estimate of 427trillion.   The Potential Gas Committee, an industry group operated by theColorado School of Mines, said last year that in 1986 about 400trillion cubic feet of gas remained to be discovered in thecategories corresponding to the Service estimates.   Girard said the Service was not counting at least 100 trillioncubic feet of gas in difficult-to-produce tight sands formationsthat the committee includes. The Service also does not count gas incertain shale formations that the committee counts.   Neither body counts gas locked in coal seams, which thecommittee termed ``enormous,'' perhaps 400 trillion to 800 trillioncubic feet. Some of that gas is being produced commercially inAlabama.   The committee has gradually lowered its estimates ofundiscovered gas, including probable reserves and reservesoffshore, from about 900 trillion cubic feet in 1980 and 1982 to765 trillion cubic feet in 1986.   Industry reaction to the new estimates was mixed.   ``We are very upset,'' said Terry Uhl of the American GasAssociation. People will not pay attention to the differingclassifications and it amounts to ``misinformation anddisinformation'' to say that undiscovered gas is only 254 trillioncubic feet, Uhl said.   Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute,said he was unable to say what the numbers mean, and the institutedoes not even keep track of such estimates. ``You never known untilyou drill,'' he said.   The figures issued in Denver were preliminary, Girard said, andthe Survey expects to issue detailed findings asking for publiccomment sometime next month.</TEXT></DOC>
