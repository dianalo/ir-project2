The state's two congressmen also won easy re-elections Tuesdayover relatively minor challenges.   Bush swamped Democrat Michael Dukakis by nearly 2-1, almost thesame margins by which Democrat Rep. Richard Stallings and RepublicanRep. Larry Craig retained their seats. With 99 percent of precinctsreporting, Bush had 253,461 votes, or 63 percent, to Dukakis'147,384 votes, or 37 percent.   A constitutional amendment authorizing a state-run lotteryprompted a massive advertising blitz by opponents.But with 870 of875 precincts reporting, 210,532 voters, or 52 percent, approved themeasure, while 196,268, or 48 percent, opposed it.   ``We were under a barrage of media messages to the tune ofthree-quarters of a million dollars,'' said Larry LaRocco, leader ofIdahoans for the Lottery. Randy Furniss, director of theanti-lottery umbrella group Consider, said his group was lookinginto legal challenges to the vote.   The Legislature has approved a bill establishing a lottery nextyear, contingent upon passage of the ballot measure.   A 1986 lottery initiative was voided by the courts as an illegalattempt to bypass the constitutional lottery ban.   Lottery backers, outspent by more than 200-1, relied on a federalequal-time provision to get out their message. They discountedwarnings that a lottery would lead to casino gambling, andemphasized a lottery's economic value to the state.</TEXT></DOC>
