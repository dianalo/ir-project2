Althoughbedding anisotropy and variations in lithology and pore-fluid pressurecontrol the details of the deformation near the inlet to the subductionchannel, the theory shows there are only five basic kinematic patternswhich can result in the development of a distinctive type of margin (TypesA-E). All incoming sediment is subducted and subduction erosion can occurat Type A margins. All sediment is subducted but a thick, narrow accretionaryprism grows by underplating of subducted sediment at Type B margins.Offscraping leads to the development of a broad, tapering prism at TypeC, D, and E margins. Incoming sediment is offscraped and subducted sedimentis underplated at Type C margins. Melange upwells from depth and is offscrapedand underplated at Type D and E margins. Incoming sediment is also offscrapedat Type D margins. The structural and metamorphic histories of the fundamentaltectonostratigraphic units within the accretionary prism are distinctduring steady-state subduction. The bedded slope cover is not metamorphosedand not intensely tectonized upslope from the inlet. During final dewateringand accretion, offscraped materials undergo a subhorizontally-directedcompression whereas underplated materials undergo a simple-shear-styleof deformation. The metamorphic changes in subducted sediment or upwelledmelange depend upon the depth of maximum burial and the thermal structureof the margin. Various episodic factors, such as seamount or ridge subduction,can modify the structural and metamorphic contrasts.</TEXT></DOC>
