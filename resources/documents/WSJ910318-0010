The Phalanx, a shipboard radar network designed to tracklow-flying warheads and shoot them down, has been underscrutiny ever since it failed to fire in May 1987 when anIraqi jet mistakenly blasted the frigate Stark with twomissiles. Thirty-seven U.S. sailors were killed.</LP><TEXT>   The employees' allegations were made in a civil suit,brought here in U.S. district court under provisions of thefederal False Claims Act. The suit's existence has been knownfor some time, but the court sealed all the documents in thecase when the suit was filed in 1988. They were quietlyunsealed late last month.   Thomas Nolan, a lawyer representing General Dynamics, saidthe company was &quot;confident that the facts, when fullydeveloped, will show that there was no problem with thetesting&quot; on the Phalanx or the Standard programs. Theweapons, he added, have shown themselves to be &quot;reliable&quot; inthe field.   Under the False Claims Act, private citizens can bringsuits on behalf of the government, and then share any moneyrecovered by Uncle Sam. The Justice Department reviews thecase and has the option of helping the plaintiffs litigatethe suit.   In this instance, the department declined in October 1989to intervene, a decision that Mr. Nolan said underscores that&quot;there has been no impropriety&quot; by the company.   But Mr. Nolan acknowledged that criminal investigatorscontinue to look into the matter, and he confirmed that thecompany has responded to a federal grand jury subpoenarequesting various documents. Moreover, sworn statements froma separate lawsuit, filed against General Dynamics and othercontractors by families of the dead Stark sailors, show thatformer Navy Secretary James Webb and other senior serviceofficials were long worried that the Phalanx wouldn't work.   The employee suit alleges, among other things, thatGeneral Dynamics taught employees at its Pomona, Calif.,missile factory how to manipulate the power levels and wiringon the testing equipment so faulty hardware could passgovernment-mandated qualification tests.   The suit further asserts that the company recorded falsetesting information into notebooks, dubbed &quot;cheat notes,&quot; andimproperly removed serial numbers from parts so theirunauthorized repair couldn't be traced.   The motive, according to the suit, was expedited deliveryto the Navy.   There are also allegations of outright overcharging.Specifically, the suit contends that General Dynamicsmanagement would order employees to perform unnecessarytasks, including dismantling &quot;what had been built in order tofully use all available budget money.&quot;   The suit did not allege monetary damages. Phil Benson, anattorney with the law offices of Herbert Hafif, whichrepresents the plaintiffs, said he would soon file an amendedcomplaint that's much more specific.   Many of those details are likely to mirror testimonydeveloped for the Stark suit. David Villanueva, a formerGeneral Dynamics engineer and one of the plaintiffs on theFalse Claims case, said that to cover up Phalanx problems,computer memories were erased by &quot;an outlaw software programknown as `PUDD,' which stood for Purge Dot D.&quot; &quot;D,&quot; he said,was the computers' record of test data.   Citing personal interviews with all of the test operatorson the Phalanx project between 1985 and 1986, Mr. Villanuevasaid: &quot;Workers, including myself, often discussed our hopesthat the Phalanx would never be relied upon by the Navyduring a critical military engagement.&quot;   The statements were obtained by Jason Rowe, a privateinvestigator who works for the Herbert Hafif office as wellas for the lawyers on the Stark case. The declarations wereoriginally filed in federal court, but have since been placedunder seal. In fact, the whole Stark case was recently thrownout because the Justice Department maintained that &quot;statesecrets&quot; would be compromised if it was allowed to proceed.</TEXT></DOC>
