Rolm, which had been a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM, will become the Rolm Systems division, the big computer maker said. IBM, at the time of the acquisition, had said it would let Rolm remain very independent.    Last March, IBM formally assigned the 6,000 sales people in Rolm to the parent company's new marketing group and in April named one of its own executives, Ray S. Abu-Zayyad, to head the unit. The moves reflected the serious problems IBM found at Rolm following the acquisition.    Rolm will retain its headquarters at Santa Clara, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
