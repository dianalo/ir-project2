The move would follow ongoing negotiations between UAL andunions for United's flight attendants, pilots and machinists aimedat refashioning a bid for the parent company.   Expectations that a revised bid would be forthcoming sent UALstock sharply higher this morning. It surged $5 to $179 a share bynoon on the New York Stock Exchange, adding to Friday's jump of$12.50.   Negotiations have taken place with all three unions since theNew York-based investment group Coniston Partners last month beganproceedings to oust 13 of the company's 15 directors, Unitedspokesman Russell Mack said Sunday.   In a recorded message to employees, the flight attendants onFriday said that negotiations between their union and companynegotiators would resume Wednesday.   At the meeting, ``top United management is expected to presentus with details of a new employee ownership plan,'' with similarpresentations expected in meetings with the pilots and machinists,the recording said.   Patricia Friend, outgoing president of the flight attendants'union, said today she did not know when those meetings arescheduled, and spokesmen for the other two unions could not bereached early today to comment.   Ms. Friend said that while a revised buyout plan may bepresented at Wednesday's meeting, ``We're a long way away from anagreement that would require a vote.''   Mack declined to comment on whether an offer would be presentedto the flight attendants or other employees this week.   Louis Marckesano, of the Philadelphia brokerage JanneyMontgomery Scott Inc., said the ``odds are pretty good'' that UALis working quickly to wrap up a new deal with employees.   A previous buyout attempt led by pilots, senior management andBritish Airways PLC failed in October when bank financing fellthrough for the $300-a-share, $6.75 billion offer.   The resignations this weekend of two officers of the flightattendants union _ Friend and Vice President Carol Holmes _ couldalso mean a deal is near, Marckesano said.   ``The flight attendants have not been as cooperative under(Friend and Holmes),'' Marckesano said Sunday in a telephoneinterview. ``This may be a sign that perhaps they are easing theirstance.''   Mack said Sunday in a telephone interview that ``discussionshave been taking place since the Coniston Partners announced theyare going ahead on the consent solicitation bid.''   Coniston has boosted its UAL stake to 11.8 percent from 9.7percent, general partner Keith Gollust said today, but he declinedcomment on the buyout situation.   The group has said only that it intends to pursue an``extraordinary transaction'' to benefit UAL investors if it winscontrol of the company's board with the permission of shareholders.   Friend and Holmes announced their resignations to United's14,000-member Association of Flight Attendants on Friday, sayingthe time has come for new leadership to step in to deal with a newESOP and stalled contract talks.   Marckesano warned, however, that consent from the nearly25,000-member machinists union will be key to any revised buyoutoffer.   Opposition from the machinists to the previous buyout offer ledin part to the banks' decision to withdraw financing.   ``They still need outside financing, even if they do strike adeal with the unions,'' Marckesano said. ``It's got to come fromthe banks in the form of loans and equity contributions or fromindividual groups, such as the pilots.''</TEXT></DOC>
