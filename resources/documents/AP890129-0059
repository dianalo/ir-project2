SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Warren E. Burger, who stepped down as chiefjustice of the United States in 1986 and hasn't heard a case since,stands to receive a $60,000-a-year pay raise because he claimedstatus as a ``senior judge'' rather than full retirement.   Burger is not alone. An additional 305 senior judges also legallyqualify for the active-duty pay raises according to administrativerecords obtained by The Associated Press that indicate one in fivedo no legal work.   The title of senior judge, created by Congress in 1919, allowsfederal jurists to sharply reduce their caseload while stillqualifying for active-duty salary increases. Federal judges areappointed for life, though they may choose to resign at any time.   Most senior judges hear cases, but Burger says he doesn't havethe time. By contrast, since he followed Burger off the bench in1987, former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell has served on the4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., and next monthwill sit on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida.   Burger declined to answer questions about his impending payincrease and his judicial workload other than to say, ``I'm too busyto sit.''   Most senior judges do substantial work and as a group they handlebetween 10 percent and 15 percent of all federal cases. ``Across thenation, the federal judiciary would be a mess without the help ofsenior judges,'' says Appeals Court Judge Frank Coffin.   Receiving active-duty pay raises while accepting no cases may notseem equitable, but it is not unlawful. Whatever Congress actuallyexpected of the senior judges, current statutes require nothing inreturn for the active-duty salary increases.   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, a member ofa House subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary. TheCalifornia Republican said Congress may want to study ``establishingsome minimum work to qualify for the raises.''   Dozens of senior judges apparently accept no cases, the AP haslearned.   A report compiled by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courtsprovides rare caseload data on senior judges. For the year endingJune 30, 1987, the study showed that 56 of 271 senior judges, or 21percent, handled no cases. Of the 56, 49 were over 75 years old.   ``If you did the survey today I don't think things would be muchdifferent,'' said David Cook, a statistician who put together thereport for the administrative office. The report contains codednumbers instead of the names of judges. Cook said office policy barshim from releasing information on individual judges or more recentcomposite data. There are now a total of 306, including Burger, butCook said the patterns found in 1987 are ``not out of date.''   Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New YorkUniversity, said, ``As a lawyer and law teacher I would be troubledif judges were being paid for doing nothing and getting incrementsfor doing nothing unless Congress made a conscious decision thateven judges in total retirement should get pay raises.''   Congress did no such thing. Judges who retire by resigningreceive pensions that equal their last year's salary, but notsubsequent increases. If Burger had taken full retirement inSeptember 1986, his annual pension would be $108,400. Instead, hereceived a 1987 increase to $115,000 and next month he stands toreceive a 52 percent boost to $175,000, the salary earmarked for thesitting chief justice, William Rehnquist.   Burger, who spent much of his career campaigning for highersalaries for judges, took senior status even though he knew at thetime he would be working as the full-time chairman of thecelebration of the 200th anniversaries of the Constitution and theBill of Rights.   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said the 81-year-old Burgerhas not been asked to hear any cases because, she presumed,Rehnquist is aware of Burger's bicentennial responsibilities, forwhich Burger is not paid.   The largest salary increases in a decade for top federalofficials take effect Feb. 8 unless Congress disapproves.Comparatively unnoticed in the political controversy over the 50percent congressional pay raise are increases just as generous, ornearly so, for the judiciary.   District judge salaries would rise from $89,500 to $135,000;appellate judges from $95,000 to $140,000; and Supreme Courtjustices from $110,000 to $165,000.   Professor Gillers said that even beyond the law, there is nothingin the judicial code of conduct that makes it unethical for a seniorjudge to do no work and collect pay raises.   ``I can't speak to the personal propriety. Every judge has tomake that decision for himself,'' Gillers said, adding, ``If the lawallows them to enjoy senior status without working and they chooseto do so, then they are behaving perfectly ethically. It may be thestatute should be changed.''   Moorhead, the congressman whose skepticism last year sidetrackedHouse action on a bill to lower the age at which a judge qualifiesfor senior status, said, ``We need to look into this much further.''   Coffin, a federal appellate judge from Portland, Maine, who plansto take senior status soon and maintain a substantial caseload, saidthe equity of the system is ``a good theoretical question.''   ``If there were more frequent pay raises for judges I'd be morebothered,'' Coffin said. The last increase came in 1987, but manyjurists have complained for years that they are woefully underpaidcompared to top attorneys who regularly argue cases before them.   The judicial pay raises are not limited to the federal courtsystem's 750 active judges but would go also to senior judges.Congress created the category 70 years ago to make way for youngerjudges while expanding the capacity of the federal courts. Today,judges who are at least 65 years old and have 15 years on thefederal bench, or those 70 with 10 years experience, face threeoptions:   _Keep working; the Constitution makes it a lifetime appointment.   _Take full retirement by resigning and receive for life theannual salary earned on their last day on the bench.   _Take senior status, with salaries that rise along with those ofactive judges. These judges can choose the number and type of casesthey handle.   The advantage of resignation is the opportunity to take otherjobs such as practicing law. The advantage has not lured many. Thereare only 13 former judges who chose to retire by resignationcompared to the 306 who took senior status.   Many observers say senior judges are essential to the federalcourt system. In one of the nation's busiest federal courthouses,the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, senior judges last yearcarried 22 percent of the workload.   ``They're providing an invaluable contribution to the judicialsystem,'' said Michael Kunz, that court's clerk.</TEXT></DOC>
