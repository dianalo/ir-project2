For much of 1987, politics will be like the snowy fields not far from this capital city in central New Hampshire: Nothing much will be happening at eye level, but there will be important stirrings just beneath the surface.    &quot;Everything happens this year,&quot; says Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. &quot;It's the make-or-break year.&quot;    As the length and cost of political contests continue to grow, presidential campaigns no longer occur only in election years. The 1988 nominations may not be won this year -- but they almost certainly can be lost.    This is the year when the presidential contenders must make formal announcements of their candidacies, establish large campaign coffers, deploy campaign organizations in the early 1988 primary states and put the finishing touches on the stump speeches, advertising strategies and other elements that make up what political professionals have come to call the &quot;message&quot; a candidate brings to the voters.    Much of the emphasis will be on this state, which is to hold the first presidential primary on Feb. 16, 1988, and on Iowa, which holds the first caucuses eight days earlier.    &quot;Anybody looking at a federal report and seeing how many dollars are being spent getting to Des Moines and Manchester,&quot; says John Buckley, spokesman for Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.), &quot;will see that the pace has quickened.&quot;    Although presidential candidates over the past quarter-century have used the year before the election to build their campaigns -- Barry Goldwater lined up many of his supporters in 1963 and Richard Nixon used 1967 to burnish the &quot;New Nixon&quot; he brought to the GOP primaries a year later -- the importance of the year before has grown in recent election cycles.    Now candidates cannot afford to wait, as John Kennedy did in 1960, until the early days of the election year itself to declare their candidacies. Former Republican Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware, in fact, announced his candidacy last year, a rash of campaign announcements may begin as early as next month and undecided figures like Republican Sen. William Armstrong of Colorado, former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee and Democratic Govs. Mario Cuomo of New York and Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts must reach decisions before long.    The principal reason is money. Without a strong signal from a potential candidate, little money will flow into the campaign treasury; political specialists estimate that the price of admission to the 1988 race is a minimum of $6 million in the bank by the end of 1987. Much of that money, in turn, will be expended in the first two months of the election year in the hope that strong early showings will turn the financial freshet into a flood.    &quot;Candidates who don't have that,&quot; says David Keene, a political adviser to Sen. Dole, &quot;have an infinitesimal chance of making it to the finish line.&quot;    But an early and strong start in the year before -- difficult to define but easy to recognize -- brings on the other important slice of political capital, the support of activists who can build organizations in Iowa and New Hampshire.    &quot;The early states are a retail political contest, and it's important that a lot of work be done in 1987,&quot; says Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a likely Democratic candidate. &quot;You don't form human relationships in a month's time.&quot;    So when a politician like Rep. Kemp, a likely Republican candidate, schedules three days of campaigning here and another three in Iowa this month alone, it is only in part for the media coverage, which in any case tends to be sporadic this early in the process.    Such trips, even when undertaken by high officeholders like Vice President George Bush, take on the trappings of an elaborate mating dance, with candidates and political activists meeting -- in living rooms, cafeterias, coffee shops, union halls and fraternal organizations -- and sizing up each other. No computer system has been designed that can take the place of these personal encounters.    &quot;You have to spend a lot of time sorting through things,&quot; says Roger Stone, a GOP political strategist who is close to Mr. Kemp. &quot;You have find out who doesn't like whom in the early primary states, you have to find out who's a talker and who's a doer, and then you have to spend a lot of time nailing down a commitment. You have to take these people to breakfast and dinner.&quot;    These candidates also are vying for the endorsement of major political figures in key states. &quot;You have to be sure you don't lose too many of the visible officials,&quot; says Republican Gov. John Sununu, who expects to play a major role in the New Hampshire primary. &quot;You don't have to get everybody's endorsement, but you have to get some people's endorsements.&quot;    The next 12 months also offer the presidential candidates the last opportunity to examine new ideas and to give shape to the appeals they will deliver once the campaign gets under way in earnest.    &quot;You can't pop new concepts in the middle of an election year,&quot; says Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, one of the Democratic aspirants. &quot;It's a disaster to come up with a new idea in the middle of a presidential election. The ideas have to develop and flower in 1987. They can't bud in the atmosphere of an election.&quot;    For that reason, retiring Sen. Gary Hart (D., Colo.) is planning to continue his series of speeches on major issues, with one on education planned for this month. But Mr. Hart has other important challenges for 1987 that the others don't share: He must maintain his visibility even as he leaves the Senate and moves his campaign staff from the political hothouse of Washington to Denver and he must raise money for the 1988 while paying off the $2.3 million he still owes for the 1984 race.    At the same time, campaign organizations have to insulate themselves from the fate Mr. Hart suffered when he placed second in Iowa in 1984, scored an upset victory in the New Hampshire primary -- and then found that no organizational work had been done for the &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; round of primaries in the South. In 1988, more than a dozen states, primarily Southern, are scheduled to hold their primaries on March 8, so many campaigns are planning to spend enough early time and money in the South to ensure that they aren't caught in the same bind.    &quot;You have to be ready in the South if you break out of the pack in Iowa and New Hampshire,&quot; says William Romjue, a political operative working for Rep. Gephardt. &quot;There has to be some structure in place in case you catch fire.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
