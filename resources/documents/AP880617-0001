(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Abbie Hoffman, who gained fame 20years ago at protests at the Democratic National Convention inChicago, plans to be host of a nostalgic ball Sunday to raise moneyfor anti-nuclear advertising.   The ``'60s Revival Ball'' at the Pearl Street nightclub herewill feature such entertainment as a musician playing the sound ofa nuclear disaster on his harmonica and free copies of Hoffman's``Steal This Book'' for the first 10 partygoers who come with theirfathers. Admission is $10.   Hoffman said he has become fond of Northampton since a localjury cleared him in April 1987 of disorderly conduct andtrespassing charges stemming from his arrest at a demonstrationagainst CIA recruiting at the nearby University of Massachusetts.   Hoffman and 14 other protesters, including Amy Carter, daughterof former President Jimmy Carter, had argued that they broke minortrespassing laws to prevent the graver harm of spy agencyrecruiting.   ``I'm not really big on nostalgia, but I do about 20 benefits ayear because raising money on our side of the fence isn't thateasy,'' Hoffman said. ``We're not like the PTL where they can turnaround and raise $12 million by auctioning off Costa Rica.''   The Northampton benefit was organized by Al Giordano, the movingforce behind a November ballot referendum aimed at closingMassachusetts' two nuclear power plants by outlawing nuclear waste.   The money raised by the ball will go to the Anti-Nuclear MediaFund to buy ad time on behalf of anti-nuclear initiativesnationwide.   Filmmaker Douglas Trumball, whose special-effects creditsinclude ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``Close Encounters of the ThirdKind'' and ``E.T.,'' will help design the anti-nuclear ads,Giordano said.</TEXT></DOC>
