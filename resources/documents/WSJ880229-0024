Formerly a top broker for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., Mr. Brant also was fined $10,000 and sentenced to five years of probation and 750 hours of community service. He had cooperated extensively with government investigators.    Mr. Brant, 35 years old, pleaded guilty in July 1984 to one count of conspiracy and two counts of securities fraud for trading on advance information about &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; columns leaked to him by R. Foster Winans, a former Journal reporter. Mr. Winans was later found guilty of fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the scheme.    Over a five-month period, the government said, the scheme netted a total of almost $700,000, with about $31,000 going to Mr. Winans.    Federal Judge Charles E. Stewart Jr. said before sentencing that he considered Mr. Brant &quot;at least as guilty as Mr. Winans, and perhaps more so.&quot; But he granted a request by Mr. Brant that he be permitted to serve the prison term on weekends, so he can continue working for Diversified Tel-Com Inc. in West Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Brant declined to discuss his job at the telecommunications firm.    Mr. Brant, whose counsel described him before the judge as having had &quot;a meteoric rise and, unhappily, a meteoric decline,&quot; could have received as many as 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine. Mr. Brant will serve the sentence in a federal prison, and must surrender in 30 days.    He appeared as the U.S. attorney's principal witness in the trial of Mr. Winans; of David Carpenter, Mr. Winans's ex-roommate and a former Journal news clerk; and of Kenneth P. Felis, a former stockbroker with Mr. Brant at Kidder. Like Mr. Winans, the two others were found guilty, and the convictions were later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.    Mr. Brant also served as the main government witness in the case of David W.C. Clark, a former partner in the New York law firm of Appleton, Rice andamp; Perrin, who was convicted in November 1987 of offenses stemming from his embezzlement of more than $3.7 million from the clients of his law firm. He allegedly used the funds to trade in the stock market. Mr. Clark died shortly before he was scheduled to be sentenced in January.    In a separate settlement agreement made earlier with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Brant agreed to be barred from the securities industry for life and to give up to the SEC $454,000 in allegedly illegal gains. In addition, his attorney said he has already paid $1 million to the government in tax obligations and made restitution of $1.3 million to Roger W. Wilson Jr., an actor who had brokerage accounts at Kidder Peabody. </TEXT></DOC>
