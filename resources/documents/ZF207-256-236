(MMI) in 1987.andP;  AMD supplies chips for Apple's laser printer,and Susan Tanenbaum of AMD's corporate communications department describedApple as &quot;one of our largest customers.&quot;andM;From 1979 to 1987, Cal-OSHA received a relatively high 22 complaints againstthe AMD plant in Sunnyvale, Calif., and issued 10 safety citations.andP;  In one1980 accident, Cal-OSHA issued a repeat citation and fined AMD for having aninadequate safety training program.andM;John Greenagle, AMD's corporate communications director, said that the 1980case resulted from AMD's failure to adequately train a new worker.andP;  He addedthat the case had a silver lining: &quot;That citation ...andP;  probably was one ofthe key factors in galvanizing the company to put in a much more effectivesafety and industrial hygiene program.&quot;andM;Before the two companies merged in 1987, MMI's safety record was even worsethan AMD's.andP;  MMI's workers' compensation insurance safety rating, as trackedby the insurance industry, had steadily declined over three years.andP;  And evenin the first three months of 1988, after which point MMI was incorporatedinto AMD's self-insured workers' compensation program and was no longer ratedby the insurance industry, MMI's safety rating was 28 percent worse than theindustry average.andM;&quot;Without question,&quot; said Greenagle, &quot;we've had problems with occasionalaccidents and spills.&quot;andP;  However, he added, &quot;the company doesn't toleratecontinuing problems.&quot;andM;'Evacuation means lost production.'andP;  National Semiconductor Corp., whichsupplies memory boards and UART chips (translator chips that facilitatecommunication between the computer and its peripherals) to Apple, had anoutstanding lost workday injury rate of 1.1 in 1987, the last year for whichfigures are available.andM;However, from 1979 to 1987, Cal-OSHA received 95 complaints about NationalSemi and issued 71 citations, prompting a company representative to says thatthe citations were &quot;relatively minor&quot; and resulted from Cal-PSHA's picking&quot;on big companies to set an example.&quot;andM;Federal OSHA cited National Semi three times for problems associated with adangerous gas leak that occurred on Dec. 9, 1987, when a company maintenanceman cut into a pipe and released toxic dichloro-silane gas.andP;  Thirty workersreported to the nurse for treatment, and National Semi sent 19 to thehospital for observation, although a company spokesman said none of theemployees suffered long-term effects.andM;Several current and former National Semi employees sharply criticized thecompany's safety policies.andP;  One employee, who asked to remain anonymous, saidthat the company's supervisors don't have uniform standards for carrying outevacuations in case of suspected chemical leaks and that National Semi doesnot hold regularly scheduled fire drills.andM;In addition, he said, many supervisors don't evacuate the plant whenemployees smell chemical leaks &quot;because evacuation means lost production.&quot;andM;When told of the charges, a National Semi official said: &quot;It's certainly notour policy to circumvent safety for production.andP;  All our supervisors knowthat.&quot;andM;Higher rate of systemic poisoning.andP;  In any event, the safety problems ofspecific companies tell only part of the story.andP;  According to LaDou, doctorsonly know the health effects of &quot;perhpas 10 percent&quot; of the 2,000 chemicals atypical semiconductor company uses in its operations.andP;  Most doctors, said LaDou, simply don't recognize occupational illnesses caused by chemicalexposure and often attribute symptoms such as continuing headaches, skinrashes or allergies to other causes.andM;Dr.andP;  James Cone, head of San Francisco General Hospital's Occupational HealthClinic, said long-term exposure to solvents commonly used in Silicon Valleycan cause serious damage to the nervous system, including memory loss.andP;  A fabroom worker may seem healthy for 15 years, he said, and then develop a severechemical sensitivity.andM;According to the California Division of Labor, systemic poisoning illnessamong semiconductor employees is more than three times that of generalmanufacturing workers.andP;  The industry also consistently shows a higherincidence of work-related illnesses than manufacturers as a whole.andM;An SIA study released in 1986 shows that body contact or inhalation ofchemicals and gases is the No.andP;  1 cause of semiconductor industry accidents.andO;Those accidents include chemical splashes as well as the effects of long-termexposure to toxic chemicals.andM;Jeanne Au lford, SIA's corporate communications director, responded that adirect link between fab room chemical exposure and a specific illness has yetto be proven.andM;The question of scientific proof is key to future liability suits.andP;  If aCalifornia worker is to collect more than a relatively small workers'compensation claim, he or she must prove that a company knowingly concealed awork place injury and that the injury got worse as a result.andP;  According toAmanda Hawes, an attorney specializing in chemical exposure cases in siliconValley, a pattern of OSHA citations or other poor safety records could helpprove concealment, but an employee would still have to demonstrate a directconnection between the exposure and a specific injury or illness.andM;Frequency of miscarriages studied.andP;  A University of Massachusetts studyconducted at Digital Equipment Corp. and released in 1987 appeared to providethat connection.andP;  The report suggests that fab room workers have an unusuallyhigh number of miscarriages.andM;However, the SIA has questioned the study's methodology and in Januaryannounced its own $3.5 million study to be carried out by the University ofCalifornia, Davis.andP;  Eighteen semiconductor companies nationwide have agreedto participate, providing a sampling base of 20,000 fabrication room workers.andM;&quot;It's the most dynamic epidemiological study that we are aware of in industryof any type ...andP;  in the United States,&quot; said Lee Neal, SIA's director ofoccupational health and safety.andP;  In the study, scientists will studyreproductive problems among fab room workers and their spouses, looking atthe impact of chemical exposure, working different shifts, work placeergonomics and other factors.andP;  The results are expected to be announced inthree years.andM;Some health professionals responded cautiously to SIA's announcement.andP;  LaDousaid he is &quot;pleased they're doing a large study.&quot;andP;  However, he said,&quot;reproductive problems [are] only one area; they should study other problemsas well.&quot;andM;Alicia Orosco of Injured Workers United, a San Francisco are organizationthat works to publicize what it sees as industrial safety hazards, said sheis concerned that employees' real problems may not be adequately studied.andO;&quot;We're looking at minority women who might be reluctant to discussmiscarriages or trying to have a baby.andP;  They might be intimidated by theirboss and a U.C.andP;  Davis Ph.D.&quot;andM;Apple's 'seal of approval.'andP;  The controversy over long-term chemical exposurein semiconductor plants will likely continue for many years.andP;  But int he caseof some companies, OSHA reports and/or insurance ratings already indicatethey had poor safety records.andM;Ted Smith, head of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, a watchdog group thatgenerally criticizes the industry's environmental and health record, saidthat Apple should refuse to buy semiconductors from companies with poor workplace safety records.andM;According to Apple spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur, &quot;safety considerations arean important factor&quot; in Apple's decision to buy semiconductors from a vendor.andO;Because poor safety can cause several problems, including delays infulfilling orders, &quot;we not only look at price but at the company overall.&quot;andM;But, according to Smith, Apple's position does not go far enough.andP;  &quot;Appleshould set standards for the industry,&quot; said Smith, by &quot;putting its seal ofapproval on companies that have good work place safety and environmentalhealth records.&quot;andM;An extreme move, perhaps, but one that could save the industry money in thelong run by taking one small step toward defusing the toxic time bomb tickingin Silicon Valley.andM;New plant and small, trained staff keep PMI safeandM;Santa Clara, Calif.andP;  -- The 900-worker semiconductor plant that belongs toPrecision Monolithics Inc. (PMI) here boasts a good safety record.andP;  PMIrecently received a contract to sell operational amplifier chips to Apple.andM;&quot;Safety dis an important measure of company success,&quot; said company CEO AlanKing.andP;  &quot;We try to have continuous improvement.&quot;andP;  According to Jay Jamali,senior safety engineer, PMI's lost work-day incidence rate was a low 2.06 in1987 and will be even better when 1988 figures are reported.andM;Wafer manufacturing requires the use of extremely dangerous gases such assilane and phosphene, both used as killer gases during World War I.andP;  A leakinto the plant or atmosphere could instantly kill hundreds of people.andM;Jamali said the company recently installed a Telos Lab 650 monitor that canmeasure toxic gas leaks down to 20 parts per billion.andP;  The company also has asystem of outside bunkers that hold dangerous chemicals and gases, eachbunker door sporting color-coded labels so that firefighters can immediatelyknow the contents.andM;Jamali said he personally orients new employees to the plant's safetyprogram.andP;  Because many workers are recent immigrants to the United States andmay not understand safety instructions in English, PMI allows workers to takean English course on company time and pays 50 percent of the cost.andM;PMI has the advantages of being located in a new plant and of having arelatively small work force, which aid in the establishment of an advancedsafety program.andP;  Larger and older companies inevitably have greaterdifficulties.andM;However, Jamali said his company's efforts make good economic sense: Whereasthe semiconductor industry faces a 20 percent average annual worker turnover,PMI's is at 15 percent.andP;  PMI's safety program, English as a second languagecourses and employee training cut down turnover, he said.andP;  &quot;Most people wantstability and to feel proud of their company.&quot;andM;Steps to ensureandM;against exposureandM;Industrial health professionals have said semiconductor manufacturers couldsave billions of dollars in potential liability claims by taking correctiveaction regarding toxic chemical exposure.andP;  Dr. Joseph LaDou of the Universityof California Medical Center in San Francisco and Amanda Hawes, an attorneyspecializing in work place chemical exposure cases, offer these suggestions:andM;* A comprehensive, independent medical study to examine all long-term effectsof chemical exposure.andM;* Systematic worker safety training in all languages spoken by employees.andM;* Medical monitoring in each plant to test for early signs of illness.andM;* Toxicologists be part of the Randamp;D process so that potential toxic effectscan be prevented before processes are introduced.andM;* Substitutes for any chemicals for which carcinogenic or reproductivehazards appear in animal tests.andM;* Improved workers' compensation to pay benefits for chemical illnesses andincreased penalties against companies that stonewall workers' comp or safetyinspection agencies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
