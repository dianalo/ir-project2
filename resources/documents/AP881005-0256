One senior Energy Department official has compared the approachto safety at the Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C., to thatwhich led to the explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28,1986.   And one member of Congress says the facility, which has beenclosed since August, should not be allowed to reopen until thesituation improves.   An Energy Department spokesman, Will Callicott, said that sincethe federal government began making atomic weapons in World War II,``there has always been a mind set, a culture, that we are doingwork that is important for national security and perhaps that mayoverride any obligation toward public accountablility.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A simple urine test that detects bladder cancerat a treatable stage may be used to help diagnose prostate and someof the other cancers that afflict nearly a million Americansannually, researchers say.   The test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors,said Dr. Raouf Guirguis of the National Cancer Institute. Theprotein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer,prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma.   ``It seems to be in all the cancers we have screened,'' Guirguissaid.   Existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer, involving removal oftissue, pose risk, are often painful and sometimes do not detectthe cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured, thecancer institute said.   But Guirguis, Elliott Schiffman and colleagues, whose study ispublished in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute, saidtheir test can identify bladder cancer at an early, treatable stage.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Supporters of a bill to impose tougherrestrictions on textile imports, after failing to overridePresident Reagan's veto, promise to renew their efforts whenCongress returns next year.   ``We'll be back,'' Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said Tuesdayafter the House voted 272-152 to override Reagan's veto but fell 11votes short of the two-thirds needed to enact the measure over hisobjections.   The action appeared to close the book on the battle for textilelegislation this year, with two weeks at most remaining beforelawmakers adjourn to campaign full time.   The bill, designed to protect American industry from foreigncompetition, would freeze current textile and apparel imports at1987 levels and limit future increases to 1 percent annually. Thesame would apply to non-rubber footwear except that no futuregrowth would be allowed.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Congress split by economic and regionaldifferences has proven again that cleaning up air pollution fromvehicle tailpipes and industrial smokestacks remains the nation'stoughest environmental problem.   Only once since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 hasCongress been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen thebasic law, and that occurred 11 years ago.   Two years ago, environmentalists in the House and Senate renewedthe campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog, acid raincaused by coal-burning factories and power plants and toxic fumesfrom chemicals.   On Tuesday, they tossed in the towel, vowing to try again nextyear.   ``There has not been sufficient willingness to compromise,''said Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who spent much of 1988 tryingto put together a consensus on a clean air bill. ``As a result, wewill do nothing.''   Mitchell, citing this summer's smog alerts around the country,said the technology exists to control air pollution. ``All we lackis the political will to do so.''</TEXT><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Political parties are wrangling over awiretapping scandal dubbed the ``Israeli Watergate'' but arespeaking little of the Palestinian uprising as a critical electioncampaign enters its home stretch.   The quarrel over claims of wiretapping came Tuesday at theconclusion of the Jewish High Holidays. It ended weeks of subduedcampaigning for the Nov. 1 Parliamentary elections that willdetermine the future make-up of the government.   Officials of the right-wing Likud bloc accused theleft-of-center Labor Party of bugging Likud campaign headquartersand wiretapping the home phone of Likud's campaign chairman MosheArens. They demanded that Attorney General Yosef Harishinvestigate, but he reserved decision, according to Israel radio.   Likud spokesman Danny Naveh said he had ``serious suspicionsthat this is an Israeli Watergate,'' referring to the scandal thatforced then-President Richard Nixon to resign in 1974.   Asked about evidence, Naveh said Arens heard clicking on histelephone line and the minister's wife saw prowlers in her yardlast week.</TEXT></DOC>
