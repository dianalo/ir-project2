This lectinis considered a membrane marker of epidermic cells. Whereas the lectinbinding proved to be radioresistant in normal epidermis within the doserange of 0.025 to 25.0 Gy (X, /sup 60/Co radiation) or 1.0 and 10.0 Gy(electrons), lesional psoriatic epidermis showed a dose-dependent reductionof FITC-WGA binding with X (2.5 Gy) and /sup 60/Co radiation (25 Gy).The selectivity of the in vitro effect is considered a consequence ofabnormal membrane quality in the psoriatic focus.</TEXT></DOC>
