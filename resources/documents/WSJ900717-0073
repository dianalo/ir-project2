Mossberg   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/17/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A6</SO><CO>   EUROP FREST</CO><GV>STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)</GV><LP>   PARIS -- The U.S. will try to build bridges to thenon-Communist political opposition in the Soviet Union, justas Washington has reached out to other non-Communistpolitical groups in Eastern Europe, Secretary of State JamesBaker said.   &quot;I don't think that's inappropriate just because it's theSoviet Union,&quot; he said. He added that he agreed to someextent with those who say the U.S. should step up contactswith such Soviet opposition figures as Russian RepublicPresident Boris Yeltsin and the mayors of Moscow andLeningrad, all of whom quit the Communist Party last week.</LP><TEXT>   But the secretary of state said only that the U.S. should&quot;touch base&quot; with the Soviet opposition &quot;to make sure that weunderstand where the opposition is coming from, that theyunderstand where we are coming from.&quot;   That stops well short of the outright political supportthe U.S. granted to non-Communist groups in Eastern Europe.Mr. Baker gave no hint that the administration is planning towithdraw its strong backing for President Mikhail Gorbachev,who still heads the Soviet Communist Party.   Nevertheless, the new policy represents a change. When Mr.Yeltsin visited Washington last year, he was given a curt,low-key reception, and administration officials laterexpressed a dim view of him.   Separately, the U.S. has proposed that the four victoriousWorld War II powers retain their rights to approve Germany'sborders, even after that country is unified, until theGermans sign a treaty guaranteeing their border with Poland.   Mr. Baker, who was flying here for the &quot;two plus four&quot;talks on German unification, told reporters that the U.S.will introduce this idea at the negotiations starting today.The talks are being held by the foreign ministers of the twoGermanys and the four World War II victors -- the U.S., theSoviet Union, Britain and France.   For this week's session of the talks, the third in theseries, the Polish foreign minister also will be present.Last week, Poland demanded that the allies retain theirrights in Germany to help force adoption of a border treaty,and Mr. Baker's comments appeared designed to reassure thePoles.   The U.S. idea on the Polish border represents a rare moveby the Bush administration to pressure West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl, who in recent months has been the Western leaderclosest to the U.S. The aim is to reassure Poland that apowerful united Germany won't violate Poland's border as NaziGermany did in 1939.   Mr. Kohl has insisted that for legal reasons such a treatycan't be written until Germany is unified. But the Polishgovernment fears the Western powers will have no leverage ifthey give up their World War II legal rights at the moment ofunification.   A senior administration official traveling with Mr. Bakerhinted that the U.S. might back off its idea if West Germanyand Poland can agree at today's meeting on some guaranteethat a simple, narrowly written border treaty will beratified quickly after the first all-German elections. Theelections are set for Dec. 2. He noted that Poland'sgovernment has told the other powers it isn't aiming atdisrupting Germany's unification.   Even as a negotiating tactic, however, the U.S. proposalrepresents a significant policy change. The U.S. has insistedpreviously that the World War II victors relinquish allrights when unification occurs.</TEXT></DOC>
