Cheney did not flatly deny a report published Sunday in TheWashington Post that quoted unidentified government sources assaying the Soviets had stopped producing four new weapons, theSS-18 and SS-24 missile, the Blackjack Bomber and the Typhoonsubmarine, and had suspended work on an aircraft carrier.   The Post said the reports, apparently based on satellitephotography, conflicted with recent statements by Cheney and VicePresident Dan Quayle that the Soviets continued to deploy newweapons.   Responding to that assertion, Cheney said the Soviets might haveslowed deployments of some new systems in order not to exceed aceiling proposed for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, whichwould slash long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to50 percent.   That treaty is not expected to be the centerpiece of a summitplanned for Dec. 2-3 in the Mediterranean Sea. Senior U.S.officials have said the START deal might be ready for anothermeeting between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev slated fornext spring or summer.   Cheney said the Kremlin was replacing many of its older nuclearweapons with more modern bombers, ballistic missiles andsubmarines, the three legs of the so-called strategic triad.   ``In effect what I think would be fair to say is that by thelate '90s, even if you have a START agreement, the Soviets willhave changed out, completely replaced, modernized, every single legof the triad,'' Cheney said.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said that despite themoderate new tone of Kremlin rhetoric, ``the Soviet Union stillremains a very heavily armed superpower.''   Commenting on reports that the Soviets had stopped deployingSS-18's, SS-24's, Blackjacks and Typhoon submarines, Baker said:``As far as I know, that has not been established.   ``We do believe that the Soviets are, in keeping with what theyhave told us, reducing their production of conventional weapons,''said Baker, appearing on the ABC-TV program ``This Week with DavidBrinkley.''   ``But as yet, we do not have firm evidence, in my opinion, thatthey have begun reducing their expenditures for strategic weapons.They may have. We may be able to establish that later,'' he said.   Addressing the broader issue of how the United States shouldrespond to changes in the Soviet Union, Baker, said ``politically,the Soviet Union is saying and acting in a way that does indeedmake it harder to argue the threat. The threat itself, in terms ofmilitary power, is still there.   ``So we really should not disarm ... until the time comes to doso in light of actual Soviet actions,'' he said.   Cheney did not directly discuss continuing SS-24, Blackjack andTyphoon production, but said the Soviets ``are deploying a newversion of the SS-18,'' a heavy strategic missile.   ``They've deployed two new ballistic missiles that are mobile _the SS-24 and the SS-25, and this year they've deployed two newballistic missile submarines, the sixth Typhoon and the sixth DeltaIV. So the pace continues,'' he said.   ``I don't think there's any realistic expectation that theSoviets will have anything other than a very modern strategic forcefor the foreseeable future,'' he said.   He said that the change in the Soviet strategic arsenal was``not a net increase so much as it's a more capable force. That isto say you're taking out older systems and putting in new ones.''</TEXT></DOC>
