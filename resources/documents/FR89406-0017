A lease could also beextended for a period of 5 years where the lessee had commenced drillingoperations prior to the end of the primary term and operations were beingdiligently prosecuted at that time.The Geothermal Steam Act Amendments of 1988 allow a lease to continue beyondits primary term without having a producing well or a contract for thesale of production provided, a well has been drilled that is capable ofproducing geothermal resources in commercial quantities and the operatoris making diligent efforts toward utilization. Because, by statutory definition,such leases are to be treated as though they were producing, in accordancewith existing rules they would be placed on a minimum royalty basis. Theinterim rule establishes an annual reporting requirement to assist theauthorized officer in determining that diligent efforts are being made.The rulemaking also provides lessees a 30-day opportunity to submit evidenceof diligent efforts in the event that the authorized officer determinesthat a lease should expire for failure to make diligent efforts towardutilization.Leases can still be extended for drilling over the expiration date. However,they can also be extended for two successive 5-year periods, either atthe end of the primary term of the lease or at the end of the 5-year extensionobtained by drilling over expiration. Under the Act, to obtain such extensions,the operator would have to show evidence of bona fide efforts to produceor utilize geothermal resources in commercial quantities, and would haveto agree either to make ``payments in lieu of commercial quantities production''or to make ``significant expenditures'' each year during the term of thelease extension. The interim rule establishes procedures for lessees toapply for such extensions.Finally, the interim rule specifies that no lease shall be issued, extended,renewed, or modified which would result in a significant adverse effecton a significant thermal feature within a unit of the National Park System.Procedures governing the determination of adverse effects are containedin an interagency agreement between the Bureau of Land Management, NationalPark Service, U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Geological Survey.An interim rule is being issued without prior notice of proposed rulemakingfor the following reasons:The Geothermal Steam Act Amendments of 1988 ease the criteria by whichgeothermal leases are continued past their expiration dates. Two groupsof lessees will be left in an uncertain status if the rules which implementthe new statutory provisions do not become effective immediately. The firstgroup are lessees with leases whose primary terms would have expired afterJuly 27, 1984. In Section 115 of the Department of the Interior and RelatedAgencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1987 (Pub. L. 99-591), Congressextended the primary term of these leases until December 31, 1988, providedcertain conditions were met. Congress did not address these leases in theGeothermal Steam Act Amendments of 1988. The second group consists of lesseeswith leases whose primary terms are due to expire during 1989 before afinal rule could reasonably be issued. Both groups will have the new statutorybenefits available to them but no administrative process by which to obtainthe benefits. At the same time, the Bureau will have to develop an interimsystem to hold these lease contracts until the procedures are in placeto process the requests for extension. Congress set out the new criteriain a detailed manner in the statute. The interim rule restates these criteriaand provides the administative procedures by which lessees may obtain thenew benefits. Making this rule effective without advance public commentas authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) is consistent with the principle thatthe public interest is best served by straightforward policies that avoidunnecessary uncertainty and confusion. For the same public interest reason,good cause exists to make the rule effective immediately without the usual30-day waiting period as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). However, even with immediate implementation, lessees will still find itimpossible to comply with the new reporting and application timeframesestablished by the rulemaking. Therefore, for those leases in effect uponenactment of the Geothermal Steam Act Amendments of 1988 (September 22,1988), with expiration dates of September 22, 1988 through July 31, 1989,lessees will be allowed until July 31, 1989, to submit the specified reportsand/or applications.The principal authors of this interim rule are Doug Koza of the Bureau'sCalifornia State Office, Richard Hoops of the Nevada State Office, andLeroy Mohorich of the Oregon State Office with assistance from Bob Kent,Karl Duscher and Mike Pool of the Washington Office.It has been determined that the interim rule does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and certifies this document willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Additionally, the interim rule would not cause a takingof private property under Executive Order 12630.
