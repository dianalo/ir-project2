We are not. Philip MorrisUSA is the largest cigarette company in the U.S. Last year wesold 220 billion cigarettes. A small number of thesecigarettes are unfortunately obtained by minors.   We at Philip Morris do not want minors to smoke. Smokingis an adult custom. Maturity of judgment is necessary tomaking a responsible, informed decision about smoking. As amatter of policy, we do not market cigarettes to minors. Weemploy only adult models in our advertising who not only arebut look over 25. We don't have celebrities or athletesendorse cigarettes in our advertising.</LP><TEXT>   Every serious study of why minors smoke points towardfamily and friends, not cigarette-company marketingpractices. Indeed, there are no significant differences insmoking incidence among minors between otherwise comparablecountries that allow tobacco advertising and those thatprohibit it. According to the Federal Trade Commission,tobacco-marketing expenditures in the U.S. have tripled since1977. During that same period, the University of Michiganreports smoking among high-school seniors has dropped by morethan one third -- from 29% to 18%. This decline is rooted notin marketing restrictions but in education including aprogram, &quot;Helping Youth Decide,&quot; sponsored by the tobaccoindustry.   As your article notes, Philip Morris has taken legalaction against companies that use our cigarette trademarks inproducts that appeal to youth, and we caused a manufacturerto remove the Marlboro logo from its computer video games.   The most effective ways to stop minors from smoking are toeducate youth and make it clear to retailers that it isillegal for them to sell cigarettes to minors. This approachhas reduced the number of minors who smoke by more thanone-third over the past 15 years and we at Philip Morris hopeand believe it will continue to do so in the future.   John R.
