Mr. Ruderman, who each weekday broadcast seven one-minute financial news reports from Business Week's Manhattan offices, is the first Business Week employee to be implicated in the continuing insider-trading scandal that has engulfed the magazine. A magazine spokeswoman said officials have no reason to believe any other Business Week employees were involved in improper trading.    Business Week fired Mr. Ruderman after the New York Stock Exchange's surveillance unit told magazine officials late Thursday it had uncovered information that suggested the broadcaster may have made four or five trades this year involving stocks mentioned in the magazine's stock column. The spokeswoman said the Big Board was tipped to the situation by a stockbroker. Officially, Mr. Ruderman was terminated for failing to disclose all his trades and stockholdings, as required by Business Week policy.    In a statement released Friday, the magazine alleged that these trades were made in advance of Business Week's Friday publication. Mr. Ruderman was one of only 10 of the magazine's editorial workers to receive special advance copies of the &quot;Inside Wall Street&quot; column early Thursday morning, a full day before Business Week hits newsstands.    The spokeswoman said Mr. Ruderman received the column, in the form it was sent to printers, to avoid unintentionally mentioning its contents in his broadcast. The spokeswoman added that magazine officials are confident Mr. Ruderman did nothing to promote these stocks in the broadcast.    Mr. Ruderman's attorney declined to comment, as did the New York Stock Exchange. However, people close to the Business Week investigation said the Big Board has formally contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating Mr. Ruderman's trades.    &quot;We are continuing our investigation and cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities,&quot; said Robert N. Landes, executive vice president and general counsel of McGraw-Hill Inc., which publishes Business Week.    No information about Mr. Ruderman's trades could be obtained. Nor was it clear whether the broadcaster passed on information about the magazine's coming articles to others.    Mr. Ruderman, whose broadcasts were heard on radio stations in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Ind., over Westinghouse Electric Corp. Group W radio stations, began work at Business Week in 1981. From 1977 to 1981, he broadcast a telephone version of the Dow Jones Report, a one-minute financial news report by Dow Jones andamp; Co., which publishes this newspaper. He worked at several New York-area radio stations for more than 20 years before that.    &quot;He is the most well-known broadcaster in the financial field -- that's why we hired him, for his steady, sturdy background,&quot; the Business Week spokeswoman said.    Mr. Ruderman is at least the twentieth person implicated in the continuing investigation into unusual stock activity in advance of Business Week articles.    The probe, headed by the SEC, the three major stock exchanges and U.S. attorneys in three states, has already led to the resignation or firings of three stockbrokers at three firms and seven employees of R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Inc., one of the magazine's printers. </TEXT></DOC>
