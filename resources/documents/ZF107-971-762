(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE BUYERS' GUIDEandM;Active VoiceandM;The Repartee from Active Voice is a call-processing system that provides autoattendant, voice mail and voice response.andP;  With central office switches thatprovide SMDI (Simplified Message Desk Interface) the Repartee can offerCentrex users integrated call processing.andM;If you are behind an ATandamp;T 1AESS or a Northern Telecom DMS 100 central office,the switches that offer SMDI, Repartee's EasyMade Switch Setup will let youautomatically transfer calls to the correct voice mailbox and light a messagewaiting light (or provide a stutter dialtone).andM;When a call is forwarded to Repartee because the number called was busy orthere was no answer, the SMDI also sends a call record over a data link.andO;When the call record reaches the Repartee the system answers the call.andM;The call record provides the system with the number called, the type of callforwarding that was used and the calling number if it is within the Centrexsystem.andP;  All of this information allows for the seamless integration of thevoice processing system with Centrex.andM;AECandM;Automation Electronic Corporation, also known as AEC, has a number ofproducts for use behind Centrex.andP;  Their call-processing systems include MaxReceptionist, an automated attendant, voice mail and voice response systemand Max 370, an automated attendant.andM;The Messenger series of digital announcers provides coverage for a singleline or 109 lines and can provide up to six minutes of digital recordingtime.andP;  The Messenger 212-Plus, the Messenger 612 and the Messenger 712 areeach suited for different needs and applications.andM;AEC's line of Automatic Call Sequencers include the CMS-Sr, the CMS-Jr andthe 1101CMS.andP;  These systems work with your key system (or other phone system)behind Centrex to answer overflow calls with an announcement and feed thecalls into your operators in the order they were received.andM;For example, the 1101CMS works with 1A2 key systems behind Centrex.andP;  It isexpandable from a minimum of two lines all the way up to 64 lines.andP;  It hasdigital voice recordings and cranks out call management reports.andM;If you already have Centrex (or a PBX) you don't need a phone with a lot offeatures built in, you need a phone that can use the features you alreadyhave available.andP;  That is the principle behind Cortelco's new Tel-Trex seriesof telephones.andM;From the Economy Model to the Enhanced Model with Handsfree Speakerphone, theTel-Trex phones have a data port, a flash button, a personal directory,ringer volume control, a four-conductor line cord and A-lead compatibility.andO;The Standard model adds a lighted hold button, a message-waiting light,last-number redial, a six-connector line jack and many other features to thepackage.andM;They also have a console model and a console controller.andP;  The 320 Console canmonitor up to 20 stations, has two-color LED line-status indicators, a timeddisconnect, an automatic line selector, automatic local-hold recall,one-button call pickup and two-button message waiting control.andP;  You can use ahandset or a headset with it.andP;  The controller supports two consoles thatshare three dedicated lines and monitor the same 20 stations.andM;Code-A-PhoneandM;Code-A-Phone's PVM 7550 Personal Voice Mail is a commercial quality answeringmachine that is jampacked with features, including features necessary to usean answering machine in a business environment.andM;For example, the 7550 has programmable call transfer when used behind Centrexor a PBX.andP;  You can have it take a message and then transfer the call or youcan have the caller dial a number to transfer the call.andP;  A programmablehookflash assures that the call transfer feature will work with whateverCentrex or PBX system you use.andM;Message privacy lets you listen to your messages over a telephone handset, anearphone or headphones.andP;  A digital message and call counter lets you know howmany people called and how many left a message.andP;  Another feature that ishelpful in business environments is the voice logging option which lets yourecord telephone conversations automatically whenever you make a call.andM;ComdialandM;The CentraTech is the shiny new answering console from Comdial.andP;  It lets theattendant keep track of 96 lines.andP;  You can have up to six consoles monitoringthose 96 lines so it's possible to have more than one attendant and a backupperson keeping an eye on things.andM;The CentraTech has one button transfer and camp on.andP;  It automatically feedsthe attendant the unanswered calls of higher priority before the unansweredcalls that rank lower on the corporate telephone.andM;It has many other nifty features.andP;  For an extensive discussion of theCentraTech's features and benefits take a look at the Testdrive section ofthe October 1989 issue of TELECONNECT.andM;Conveyant SystemsandM;Conveyant has two products just for Centrex: the TeleDesk Centrex workstationand the TeleDesk Office Manager.andM;The TeleDesk is a PC-based workstation that helps attendants deal withCentrex.andP;  It can handle up to 50,000 Centrex stations.andP;  When used with SMDI(Simplified Message Desk Interface) the TeleDesk lets the attendant knowforwarded call status on internal calls and the calling party's name andnumber.andP;  It is an attendant position, a message center and a systemmanagement console rolled into one.andM;The TeleDesk includes software, a central control unit and a specializedkeyboard that is sort of a computer keyboard and telephone in one.andP;  Use yourown computer and the system costs $8,500, or get the system and anAT-compatible PC for $10,500.andM;The TeleDesk Office Manager is also designed to help an attendant deal withCentrex.andP;  This product is for small businesses or a department secretary.andO;Instead of looking like a computer, it looks more like an attendant station-- doesn't have a computer screen, but sports an LCD screen.andM;It gives the attendant many of the same advantages as the TeleDesk doesthough.andP;  It has automatic hold, a programmable name for each station,incoming line identification, transfer name identification and programmableline preferences.andP;  It handles four incoming lines and has 24 station BLF/DSSor speed-dial keys.andM;David SystemsandM;The David Information Manager adds voice features and applications to yourCentrex service and integrates data terminals and Ethernet workstations orpersonal computers to boot.andM;Voice networking is provided by the Centrex system.andP;  If you use the DavidManager in a voice only application the David-Sets would access one B channelof 64 Kbps for the digital voice services and use the D channel (the ControlChannel) for control communication.andP;  The David-Manager also provides localintercoms between David-Sets for work-group communications.andM;It is possible to use the David-Manager for a data or LAN only application.andO;In this case the David-Manager functions as a standalone data PBX withEthernet Local Area Networking.andP;  With Centrex and the David-Manager crankingat once it possible to have digital voice service, asynchronous data,Ethernet LAN and a control channel available at the same RJ-11 jack.andP;  Allthis uses only a single pair of existing telephone wiring.andM;DBAandM;The SmarTalk 208 is a two-line key system that doesn't require a KSU.andP;  Youcan use up to eight phones with the system, but it is economical to use justtwo if that's what you need.andP;  This kind of flexibility makes it handy behindCentrex.andM;The SmarTalk phone has a 16-number speed-dial memory which can be a big helpwhen you are trying to remember those Centrex feature codes.andP;  Other juicyfeatures include station and line status display, a speakerphone, handsfreeintercom, message waiting indication and volume control for the handset andspeaker.andM;The SmarTalk 308 can also be used with up to eight telephones, but this onehandles three lines.andP;  Like the 208, it is compatible with answering machinesand modems and installed with modular connectors on loop or home-run wiring.andM;DictaphoneandM;The Digital Express Voice Mail System from Dictaphone combines voice mail anda centralized dictation system.andP;  Digital Express lets you do all the normalvoice mail stuff: record messages instead of filling out &quot;while you were out&quot;slips, revise and edit the messages you record, broadcast one message toseveral people, deliver messages to password protected mailboxes and flagpriority messages -- but it also does a little more.andM;The Hard Copy feature lets both the sender and the recipient of a voice mailmessage to electronically forward it for transcription.andP;  This saves you fromcopying those long, detail messages yourself and is helpful when you need apermanent record of the message.andM;Open Mail lets you record a message without sending it.andP;  It lets you make a&quot;rough copy&quot; of a voice-mail message for later review and editing.andP;  TheDigital Express can be accessed from any touchtone phone.andP;  It can be used todictate letters and memos for transcription even when the office is closed.andM;GandalfandM;Pacific Bell and Bell of Pennsylvania both use Gandalf's equipment to provideCO LAN service to their customers.andP;  Gandalf's Starmaster is a networkprocessor and their Dovtrex is a voice-data over voice system.andP;  These twowork together to provide simultatneous voice and data transmission.andM;If you are in a private network situation, you can use these products withyour PBX to provide similar service to your company.andM;The CPE part of the Star-Master/Dovtrex system is the LineMiser DOV640/2640/RM 3640, known to its friends as a DOV (data over voice) unit.andP;  TheDOV lets you send voice and data over existing two-wire telephone lines --the same ones you had been using for voice only.andP;  It superimposes the dataabove the voice-band, without affecting the voice transmission.andM;It connects with a standard modular jack and operates at up to 64 Kbpssynchronous or up to 19.2 Kbps asynchronous.andP;  Features include end-to-endsignaling and diagnostic testing.andP;  It is available in a standalone unit or arackmount version.andM;Gordon KapesandM;Gordon Kapes has a page controller designed specifically for use with Centrex-- the MZ-4C model of their MZ-4 page controller.andM;The features of the MZ-4 include a pre-page alert chime, background music, anight tone generator and auxiliary relay which can be connected to any of avariety of devices.andP;  The operating status of the MZ-4 is indicated with sevenLEDs.andM;The MZ-4's claim to fame is that it is a four-zone page controller.andP;  You canaccess those four zones one at a time, all at once in any combination.andP;  Andfeatures are selectable on a zone by zone basis.andM;Gordon Kapes' Model 125 will be available for delivery in the first quarterof 1990.andP;  It provides unattended site monitoring and access oftelecommunications systems and it can be used with Centrex.andP;  It includes twoserial ports, a 1200/300 bit per second modem, contact closure and logicsignal inputs and relay contact output.andM;FujitsuandM;Fujitsu recently added a Business Management Package to the Starlog telephonesystem.andP;  This package lets you forward calls to the central office.andP;  Whichmeans you are not limited to forwarding calls within the system, but can sendthe calls to off-premise locations too.andM;It also provides an interface for the ACD Report Manager, incoming SMDRinformation, forced account code entry, line button copy by CommandMaintenance Code (to copy phone programming to another telephone) and aterminal password which restricts selected stations from outside lines.andM;The Starlog includes such features and automatic call distribution, dataswitching, automated attendant, voice messaging and special features for thelodging industry.andM;Lanier Voice ProductsandM;Lanier's Renaissance Series DK56 and DK96 digital key systems allow you tovary your combination of lines and stations.andP;  The DK56 can be set up for 56stations and four CO lines to 24 stations and 20 CO lines.andP;  The DK96 handles96 stations and eight CO lines to 40 stations and 36 CO lines.andM;As you can probably guess, these systems can handle those special squared(one line to one station) applications like travel agencies and telemarketingcompanies.andM;The fact that it is a digital system makes integration of voice mail, callaccounting and facsimile machines that much easier.andP;  The technology alsomakes such things as non-blocking intercom paths possible.andP;  And when thoseintercom calls come through, a distinctive internal ringing tone lets yourpeople know what kind of call is coming.andM;The DK56 and DK96 also have improved least cost routing.andP;  The new LCR givesyou more flexibility in defining station use and routing.andM;MarubeniandM;Marubeni's Optima 1240/2470 digital hybrid system lets you put as many as 10devices on a single four-wire cable run with its bus multiplexerarchitecture.andP;  These devices can be the standard Optima telephone set withdisplay, a DSS console, a Dial-in Service Console or, using an analog todigital adapter, the devices can be a personal computer, facsimile machine ora single-line telephone set.andM;The system handles external interfaces to a wide variety of trunk and linetypes, including Centrex lines.andM;Metro TelandM;The Call Screener answers an incoming call, plays the caller a digitallyrecorded message and then lets the caller hang up or stay on the line to&quot;ring through&quot; to a live person or to an answering machine, modem, faxmachine or call diverter.andM;It can be used in small retail stores to deliver store hours and specials, inother small businesses to deliver repetitive information or it can be used ina &quot;big business&quot; environment for department uses, information hotlines or tofront modems and fax machines with warnings to voice callers and instructionsfor users.andM;The Metro Tell Call Screener answers a single line and has 64 seconds ofmessage time shich can be divided into two messages.andP;  It has a large LCDscreen for instuctions and a timer which shows the length of the recording.andO;A counter lets you know how many calls it answered, how many rang through andhow many calls hung up after they heard the message.andM;Messages are recorded and played back using a standard telephone handset.andO;There is a remote control option to let you record messages, bypass themessage or select the second message from a remote location.andM;MoscomandM;Moscom has a number of products created to let companies use SMDR Centrexdata generated by their local CO.andP;  In Ameritech country Centrex users can usea special Centrex version of Moscom's M3000 telephone cost management systemto pool SMDR data created with the Call Detail Recording System software for1AESS switches developed by Indiana Bell and now standardized and tariffedacross the Ameritech system.andM;The M3000 can poll the system after hours, cost each call record and thenstore the record in its database for later management reporting.andM;Folks behind Northern Telecom DMS-100 CO switches can use a DNC-50,500interpreter to use the M3000 to gather information from DNC-50s and DNC-500sthat may be attached to the DMS-100 switch.andP;  Thomas Greer, director ofproduct management for Moscom tells us, &quot;This solution is generally used inhigh traffic situations or where the user wants access to the records closerto real time.&quot;andM;Centrex users who get their SMDR records on tape can load them into theirUNIX-based MaxNet system for costing because the system's CAS (CallAccounting System) module handles AMA nine-track tapes.andM;MPSIandM;If uou always liked MPSI's A+Plus call processor and wished it worked withCentrex, your wish has come true.andP;  MPSI recently introduced the Centrex SMDIIntegration Pakage for the A+Plus.andM;Now a caller can be forwarded directly to the correct mailbox if theextension they are calling is busy or unanswered.andP;  And it helps out on themessage delivery end also.andP;  The integration package lets the A+Plus activatemessage-waiting indicators on Centrex phones.andM;MultimilandM;So you say your Centrex package offers one hundred features and you plan touse every single one of them?andP;  But you can't remember all those feature codesand no phone has enough programmable buttons.andP;  Alpha phone and Memocard cansave the day.andM;The 2K Memocard, which is used with the Alpha phone, will store an average of100names and phone numbers -- or Centrex feature codes complete with theirnames.andP;  The 8K card will store an average of 400 names and numbers -- so youcan fit in all those features and your whole phone book too.andM;Other features of the Alpha phone include a 32 character LCD display, a calland appointment reminder, speakerphone and a date-time alarm clock.andP;  It isavailable in four models: an add-on speed dialer; a handsfree phone with allthe features of the speed dialer; a phone with handset; and a model with bothhandsfree and hanset functions.andM;Newbridge NetworksandM;Newbridge's CO LAN/PC will make you like your CO LAN a lot better.andP;
