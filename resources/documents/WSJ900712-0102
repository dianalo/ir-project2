The omnibus bill, which passed 94-6, also would expand thefederal death penalty to cover 34 crimes, curb theconstitutional appeals process for death-row inmates, andprovide $900 million in federal assistance to locallaw-enforcement agencies in the coming fiscal year -- twicethe amount proposed by the Bush administration.</LP><TEXT>   Eager to appear tough on the widespread looting of Sandamp;Ls,senators increased penalties for financial fraud, including anew statute that would provide up to life imprisonment forhigh-level thrift executives who conspire with three or moreother violators and derive more than $5 million from theircrimes. Other provisions would provide prosecutors withbroader authorization to use civil seizure and forfeiturelaws in bank and Sandamp;L fraud cases.   The Senate also authorized new spending of $162.5 millionfor each of the next three years to hire more federalinvestigators and prosecutors devoted strictly tofinancial-institution cases. That amount would be in additionto $50 million appropriated for such cases for the currentfiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In addition, the Senateauthorized funds to hire 2,500 new federal agents and 480prosecutors to deal with drug trafficking and other crimes.   The House is considering omnibus crime legislation of itsown, including various Sandamp;L enforcement provisions. But itisn't clear when the full House will vote on these measures.Equally unclear is whether President Bush would back a crimepackage that includes the Senate's three-year ban on ninetypes of assault weapons.   The Senate's rush to provide new money for thrift-fraudprosecutions by the Justice Department came as the HouseAppropriations Committee voted to give the TreasuryDepartment's Secret Service expanded authority to initiateits own investigations of Sandamp;L-related crimes. The provisionis attached to a fiscal 1991 bill funding the TreasuryDepartment and is likely to touch off a turf war with theFederal Bureau of Investigation, an arm of the JusticeDepartment that has tried to stop efforts by the SecretService to become more involved in reducing the currentbacklog of thousands of cases.   Reflecting an apparent decision by the White House, theTreasury officially opposes the expanded authority. Butbehind the scenes, the Secret Service has promised allies inCongress that it can make as many as 100 agents availableimmediately, and 300 within the next fiscal year.   The Senate's election-year anti-crime package, whichseemed dead only several weeks ago, jumped back to life witha high-voltage shock of Sandamp;L rhetoric. &quot;We need to be crackingdown on the orgy of fraud and lawbreaking that occurred inthe savings-and-loan crisis,&quot; said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.,Vt.). The hefty batch of thrift-fraud provisions was added tothe omnibus bill at the last minute, with almost no partisanbickering.   Last month, a filibuster orchestrated by the NationalRifle Association had threatened to kill the entire package.But the powerful NRA repeatedly was unable to muster amajority to eliminate the prohibition on assault weapons.Meanwhile, quiet negotiations led by Sens. Joseph Biden (D.,Del.) and Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) kept the bill alive untilthe almost desperate desire by lawmakers to take action onthe Sandamp;L issue assured its passage.   Many of the Sandamp;L-related provisions added to the Senatebill, such as the provision for life imprisonment for &quot;Sandamp;Lkingpins,&quot; appeared to be largely symbolic. Others includedthose that merely formalize special thrift-fraud task forcesalready created by the Justice Department.   The crime bill also would facilitate speedier restitutionto victims of Sandamp;L fraud, allow for public disclosure ofregulatory enforcement actions, and permit the government toundo fraudulent transactions made by thrift executives.Another provision would encourage individuals to report Sandamp;Lfraud to authorities by providing rewards for informationleading to convictions or civil recoveries. In civil cases,the amount of such rewards would be tied to the value ofassets recovered and could total hundreds of thousands ofdollars.   William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp.,urged Congress to pass the crime bill, saying it would &quot;proveto be a formidable deterrent to financial institution fraudand abuse.&quot;   In a hearing before a House Judiciary subcommittee, Mr.Seidman also defended the government's record in pursuingcrooked Sandamp;L directors and officers. The agency recovered morethan $100 million last year in liability claims against Sandamp;Lexecutives, he said, and an additional $200 million insettlements and judgments in the first half of 1990.   The Senate dropped from the crime package a provision thatwould have allowed, under certain circumstances, the use ofillegally gathered evidence in criminal trials.   ---   David Rogers contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
