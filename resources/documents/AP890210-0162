The department asked a three-member panel of the U.S. Court ofAppeals to reconsider its refusal to delay the trial while itstudies the presiding judge's refusal to implement procedures thegovernment argues are needed to prevent surprise disclosures ofclassified information.   If the trial were allowed to start next week under the groundrules set by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, the departmentsaid, ``highly sensitive items of classified information will berevealed by the defense in its opening statement, causingirreperable damage to both the national security and foreign affairsinterests of the United States.''   The Justice Department, at the request of intelligence agenciesincluding the National Security Agency, wants more stringentcontrols on North's plans to introduce classified material in thecase.   In a court filing Wednesday, the department criticized Gesell,saying he had adopted procedures that ``fail'' to identify whatportions of the classified material North wants to present arerelevant and whether they are admissible.   Gesell finished selecting a jury Thursday and rejected thedepartment's censorship bid, calling it ``wholly misplaced.'' Hetold the jurors to report back Monday morning.   Gesell said the department has no standing to interfere in thetrial at this point because independent counsel Lawrence Walsh ishandling the prosecution of North. Walsh wants to proceed with thetrial immediately and opposes the department's effort to halt thecase.   A few hours later, the appeals court upheld Gesell's decision.   Loye Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, said the appealsjudges on Thursday ``had before them a lot more'' material fromWalsh ``than they had from us.''   Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis, head of thedepartment's criminal division, claimed that ``the risk to nationalsecurity would be significant'' under the rules laid down by Gesell.He said the government would lack control over ``disclosure of verysensitive, classified information.''   Gesell issued a ruling Jan. 19 permitting North to introduceclassified material if it tends to show that North's purpose was notto violate the law, or that government witnesses are lying.   He also said North may use classified information, whererelevant, about the Reagan administration's efforts to have othercountries aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels after Congress had bannedU.S. military aid to them.   The Justice Department is seeking a court order saying that Northmay disclose no classified information to which the U.S. governmenthas any pending objection.   North is charged with concealing from Congress and the attorneygeneral the administration's secret support for the Contras duringthe period in which direct U.S. aid was banned.   He also is accused of illegally accepting installation of asecurity system at his home, converting to his own use at least$4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra leader and conspiring touse a tax-exempt foundation illegally to raise money for the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
