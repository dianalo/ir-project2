Several pointed to domestic programs gutted by budget cuttingand said the costly space ventures of the 1960s may not beaffordable in the 1990s.   Bush marked the 20th anniversary Thursday of the first lunarlanding by proposing that the United States establish a base on themoon in the 21st century as a stepping stone for manned mission toMars.   ``The party of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson applauds thedecision of President Bush to recommit America to spaceexploration,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.   ``But the real test of presidential leadership is not whether hecan marshal the words but the resources to restore America'spreeminence in space. In sum, Mr. President, there's no such thingas a free launch,'' added Gephardt.   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., said Bush offered ``the country not achallenge to inspire us, but a daydream to briefly entertain us''in making his proposal ``with no money, no timetable, and no plan.''   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., noted the administration itself hadreduced NASA's planned request for $140 million next year for thePathfinder development program, a preparation for a manned Marsmission, down to $93 million.   Funding for a space station also was debated as the Houseapproved by voice vote a $65.1 billion fiscal year 1990appropriation for the Veterans Administration, the Department ofHousing and Urban Development and 18 other independent agencies,including NASA.   ``The space station is not the way to go to space. It is the B-2bomber of the space program,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.   He was defeated in his attempt to transfer $714 million fromfunding for the space station to programs for veterans medicalcare, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing.   Schumer estimated the lunar space station and a manned trip toMars would cost $400 billion.   ``I am a believer in space technology,'' said Schumer, ``but youcan't have everything. As we reach for the stars, let us not forgetthose who live underneath them.''   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., suggested some space money could betterbe used to eliminate ``lousy housing, inadequate education andschools loaded with asbestos.''   ``For most people, their universe will be for all of their livesright here on Earth,'' he said.   But Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., argued that expanded spaceexploration, including completion of a lunar space station, wasessential to national security and satellite communicationsdevelopment.   ``The myth we have to shatter is that space is a luxury,'' saidRoe.   The House appropriations bill earmarks $1.65 billion of NASA's$12.2 billion budget for the space station. The bill is $1 billionless than the Bush administration requested.</TEXT></DOC>
