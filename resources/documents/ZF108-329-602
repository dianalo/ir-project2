 Imagining arcane languages with strange grammars suchas C and Pascal that require a nerdlike mathematical concentration to learn,they avoid programming at all costs.andM;But nearly every Macintosh user owns a much more humane programming language-- HyperCard -- and many also own a spreadsheet application with asophisticated macro language.andP;  These programs use familiar office tools, suchas the note cards of HyperCard and the accounting tables of spreadsheets, asprops to ease the transition into programming.andM;The thrill of programming.andM;While many never look beyond the sample applications Apple supplies withHyperCard, others get hooked trying to see what they can do.andP;  HyperCard'sauthoring tools have inspired legions of non-programmers to write customapplications.andM;Take Eli Hollander, mild-mannered head of the film and video program at theUniversity of California at Santa Cruz, now a HyperCard superman.andP;  &quot;I neverintended to do any programming, but along came HyperCard and I startedplaying around,&quot; Hollander said.andP;  &quot;It took a little while for me to realizethat it was a really useful tool, but when I did, it became an obsession.andO;Before I knew it I was up to 400 pages of code.&quot;andM;Hollander turned his passions for video and the Macintosh to buildingVideoMaker, an inexpensive editing program for independent video makers.andP;  Herecently sold his program to what he called a large video company, which willfurther develop the product.&quot; I learned a lot about programming andinterfaces, but I'm still not interested in C or Pascal,&quot; Hollander said.andM;Hollander's adventure in programming would have been far more difficultbefore HyperCard.andP;  Luckily, HyperTalk, HyperCard's programming language,takes care of the most difficult tasks for you.andP;  The data structures andinterface to objects such as buttons and windows are all built-in.andM;August International Corp., a service company in Orange, Calif., thatsupplies health-care cost maintenance to corporations, hired David Baron, aMacintosh enthusiast with some Helix database-development experience, to tametheir rapidly expanding VAX database with a Mac front end.andM;&quot;We had a very complex system with a zillion different files, a very involvedapplication, and all color Macs,&quot; said Baron, now a senior consultant withSQL Solutions Inc. of Burlington, Mass.andP;  He learned SQL and VMS so he coulduse Sybase on the VAX, and while waiting for Emeryville, Calif.-based SybaseInc.'s 4th Dimension database interface, found SuperCard from Silicon BeachSoftware Inc. and became a programmer.andP;  The project was to create a front endto three separate relational databases used to track medical procedures andcosts.andP;  It required color coding and large screens and needed to be simpleenough for nurses to annotate the records easily.andM;&quot;I had never used VMS, I don't know C or Pascal, and I've never programmedreal languages,&quot; Baron said.andP;  Yet, in what he calls &quot;the classical Macintoshlearn-as-you-go kind of thing,&quot; Baron used SuperCard to design and write afront end to August International's database system, which is used by morethan 200 employees.andM;More than a spreadsheet.andP;  Of all programming tools available to Macintoshusers, spreadsheet macros are the most easily accessible.andP;  Microsoft Corp.'sExcel, Full Impact from Ashton-Tate Corp. and Informix Software Inc.'s Wingzlet you create macros by recording your keystrokes and playing them back.andO;They also include powerful programming capabilities that let you create newapplications.andP;  But not many users have even cracked the macro manuals.andM;&quot;I've seen Ashton-Tate do some really wild things with its macros,&quot; said KirkMackes, manager of departmental computing at Connaught Laboratories Inc. ofSwiftwater, Pa., a manufacturer of biological vaccines.andP;  &quot;The language isstraightforward andsomething the end user can learn to do, but the majoritydon't learn it unless they have to.&quot;andM;Connaught has standardized on Macs and Full Impact.andP;  Mackes' group does mostof the programming, but many users take advantage of the record and playbackcapability to automate documents such as financial reports.andP;  They save timebecause they don't have to re-create the reports each month and don't needhelp from the programming staff, Mackes said.andM;At American Telephone and Electronics of San Francisco, the financialanalysts were helped by the MIS department, then set loose to program ontheir own.andP;  Robert Brock, ATandamp;E manager of information services, had hisdepartment create a corporate model, write a library of Excel macros toaccess it, and then train the analysts to use them.andM;The analysts used the model to make market forecasts for the company'splanned wristwatch pager.andP;  &quot;It allows me to do more-complex things withspreadsheets than I could ever do before,&quot; said Chuck Raby, acting directorof research and financial analysis at ATandamp;E.andP;  Raby, a certified publicaccountant with plenty of spreadsheet experience, has no programmingbackground.andM;The automated model allows the analysts to change suppositions, such asadding 1 percent to the rate of inflation, and to track the results for all50 states.andP;  &quot;I can see what happens market by market without changing 50different spreadsheets,&quot; Raby explained.andP;  &quot;It's also much easier to makechanges than in a true programming language.&quot;andM;Even for professional programmers, there are advantages to using higher-levellanguages.andP;  For instance, it would take at least one year of programming todevelop a custom application to handle NASA's Office of Space Operationsmultibillion-dollar, seven-year budgets, according to Bob Shaffer, a systemsengineering consultant to NASA.andP;  It took Shaffer three months with Wingz'sHyperScript scripting language.andM;He has continued his work with Wingz and NASA has added two more Wingzprogrammers to expand the budget system.andP;  &quot;What HyperCard did for databaseand graphics, Wingz does for the spreadsheet and charting,&quot; Shaffer said.andM;The future.andP;  Like everything else on the Macintosh, end-user programming isexpanding.andP;  However, the number of programs with scripting, macro orprogramming languages means a proliferation of commands that do the samethings.andM;There have not been organized attempts to formalize a general Macintoshscripting language, but many are hoping that HyperTalk will serve as a model.andO;SuperCard uses a superset of the HyperTalk language and Wingz's HyperScriptis grammatically similar.andP;  But Apple plans to drop HyperTalk in favor of abroader-based language, called AppleScript.andM;AppleScript will be HyperTalk-like with similar objects and syntax but willextend to all Macintosh applications running under System 7.0.andP;  But don'twait for AppleScript.andP;  Even though System 7.0 will be available this summer,AppleScript will not be a part of the first release.andM;Macintosh programming is available and accessible.andP;  You don't need a degreeor a plastic pocket protector to do it.andP;  Many come to it out of necessity,but others discover it because the Mac gave them the opportunity and theychose to explore it.andM;APPLEandM;HyperCard: $49andM;20525 Mariani Ave., Cupertino, Calif.andP;
