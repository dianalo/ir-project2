GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL)MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   FOR 12 YEARS, radio listeners in rural corners of upstate New York have listened to Ed Slusarczyk's forecasts of honey, hog and maple syrup prices. But in a few months, they will be hearing a more sophisticated blend of news, including hourly reports from Washington and live, play-by-play broadcasts of college and professional sports events.    Mr. Slusarczyk's Ag Radio Network Inc. in Utica, N.Y., is moving upscale, joining a procession of statewide radio networks elsewhere that are expanding from their agricultural roots. Moreover, in some places, such as Pennsylvania and Oregon, statewide radio networks are springing up where none existed before.    Satellite technology is allowing entrepreneurs to start and expand these networks, and a growing demand for state and local news is increasing the market for their broadcasts. Advertising revenue has been slower in coming, though that may be changing. &quot;Our claim is that we allow an advertiser to penetrate small markets at low cost,&quot; says Tom Longfellow, sales marketing director of the National Association of State Radio Networks in Little Rock, Ark.    THERE ARE 26 statewide radio network companies in the U.S. Each originates broadcast programs and transmits them by satellite to affiliated stations around the state. The affiliates then air the broadcasts in their local markets. Generally, the networks provide the broadcasts at no cost and earn revenue by selling advertising time on the programs they originate.    Start-up costs are fairly high. It took about $1 million, for example, to get Pennsylvania Network Inc. in Philadelphia off the ground last January, says Steven D. Rubin, president. Now, Pennsylvania Network provides 25 news broadcasts a day to 57 affiliates throughout the state. Each week the network's news broadcasts carry up to 99 minutes of advertising, which it sells for approximately $300 a minute. The network earns additional revenue by selling time on sports broadcasts, including games played by Philadelphia's professional football, hockey and basketball teams.    &quot;The industry normally works on a 20% pretax profit margin,&quot; Mr. Rubin says. &quot;We're expecting a little more -- between 30% and 40%,&quot; partly by keeping costs low.    Some of the earliest state radio networks have grown into sizable businesses. Learfield Communications Inc. in Jefferson City, Mo., started in 1972 with agricultural reports broadcast to just eight affiliated stations. This year, Learfield expects its agricultural service, two state news networks and sports broadcasts to generate $4.5 million in revenue.    HOWEVER, THE INDUSTRY also has had its share of failures. &quot;Those run by newsmen or engineers, rather than by advertising salesmen, tend not to do as well,&quot; says Clyde G. Lear, founder and president of Learfield.    In courting advertisers, networks stress the size of their audiences. For example, the Oregon News Network in Portland has &quot;twice the audience of any of Portland's top-rated radio stations,&quot; says Victor M. Ives, the network's owner.    Still, many advertisers hesitate to spend money on an unfamiliar medium. &quot;Since we're neither local nor national, we sometimes slip through the cracks in an advertising plan,&quot; says Mr. Longfellow, the industry association's marketing director.    Some advertising representatives, though, see potential in the networks. States with them &quot;could be great test areas&quot; for finding the right media mix before a national rollout, says Mark Kaline, a network radio supervisor at the Ogilvy andamp; Mather ad agency in Chicago. In addition, he says, &quot;Some of the state networks are cost-effective enough that you can reach the major markets and get the rest of the state for just a trifle.&quot;    ---   White House Conferences: How Often?   How about holding a White House Conference on Small Business every two years? Some people think that would be overkill, but it was one idea mentioned at a Senate Small Business Committee hearing last week on a bill to establish a permanent federal mandate for such conferences.    Frank S. Swain, the Small Business Administration's chief counsel for advocacy, was decidedly cool on the Senate bill, which doesn't yet have a companion measure in the House of Representatives. &quot;We should hold conferences when small-business owners themselves feel a need for one and when the issues require a new look,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether that is four or 14 years from now is not predictable.&quot;    One possible compromise, offered by committee Chairman Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.): Legislate that a small-business conference be held in non-election years, as needed, at intervals of no less than four years but no more than eight years.    ---   TRUTH IN FRANCHISING: The average franchise owner nets only $21,000 a year, can work 12-hour days, seven days a week, and may still see the business fail. So warns a four-page Money Advisory Special Report on franchising, balancing the rosy view often painted of franchising opportunities. The report is available from the National Institute of Business Management, Dept. EWSR814, 1328 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10001. </TEXT></DOC>
