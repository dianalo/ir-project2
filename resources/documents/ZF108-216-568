(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Remote access software saves shoe leather, car tires, and frequent fliermiles.andP;  Because such software enables instant access to the desktop, a LANsupport person can help users through tough times, even when the users aremiles away.andP;  When away from the office, it can let you access the data andprinters you need.andP;  The good news is this year's crop of remote accesssoftware is a whole lot more robust, reliable, and featured than last year's.andM;In an era when telephones have infiltrated the car and people fax their lunchorders to delis, most people would find it intolerable to be able only tocall people within their building.andP;  Networks enable communication betweencomputers, just the way telephones provide the humans.andP;  And most people, evenif their company has only one office, need access to information that residesoutside that single location.andP;  This information may reside on anothernetwork, a host, or public bulletin board.andM;In our articles, we often focus on the high side of wide area networking, theX.25 gateways, the remote bridges and routers.andP;  But the vast majority ofusers aren't attempting to share mainframe data or build a complexdistributed database; they need occasional access to a remote resource,whether that resource is a file, printer, or host.andP;  So rather than focusingon the underlying hardware link, in this article, we will concentrate on thesoftware that provides the connection.andM;Communications software has long enabled conversations with remote hosts,bulletin boards, and other services.andP;  Users of Crosstalk and its ilk may callup a remote computer and view information or transfer files.andP;  Remote accesssoftware encompasses communication software's functionality, then takes itone step further.andP;  Remote access software lets a user call a remote PC andcontrol it as if he were sitting at the remote PC's keyboard.andP;  Remote accesssoftware brings the network's resources to you, regardless of your physicallocation.andP;  But unlike communications software, you are not limited totransferring files; you can control all the PC's, and by extension, thenetwork's resources, from application software to printers.andM;When controlled by remote access software, a remote PC sends keyboardinformation over the modem link to the host workstation, which in turn sendsscreen update information back to the remote PC.andP;  This allows the user totype on the remote PC keyboard but have the characters appear on the hostPC's screen.andP;  Unlike communications software, the processing is performed atthe host PC.andP;  If this host PC is attached to a network, then the remote PCuser gains access to the network's resources as well.andM;Richard de Mornay, vice president of marketing for Norton-Lambert and thedesigner of the company's CloseUp/LAN product, likens communications softwareto the U.S.andP;  Postal Service and remote access software to the telephone.andP;  &quot;Aremote program is like a telephone conversation; it is real time.andP;  Acommunications program is like the mail.andP;  You look at a document and send itback,&quot; he says.andM;Remote access software is exemplified by Norton-Lambert's Close-Up, TritonTechnologies' Co/Session, and Microcom Software Division's Carbon Copy Plus.andO;A number of other packages are available.andP;  A sister type of product allowsusers to control other PCs over the LAN cable, rather than through a modemand a phone line.andM;Remotely Very UsefulandM;The ability to remotely control another PC has many applications.andM;Remote user support.andP;  Remote access software has its roots in user support,and today, it is most widely used for this purpose.andP;  &quot;I can't print,&quot; saysone user.andP;  &quot;My menu won't load,&quot; says another.andP;  If the user and supportperson are in the same building, help is an elevator ride away.andP;  But the realbenefit of remote access software becomes apparent when the LAN supportperson is across town or in a different city.andM;The support person merely has to dial into the user's PC and look for missingfiles or a program configured incorrectly.andP;  He does not have to spend a longtime on the telephone trying to solve the problem blindly.andM;If used within a company, remote access software allows for centralizedsupport.andP;  If used by a reseller or a manufacturer, it allows them to supportmore users.andP;  in fact, DEC, HewlettPackard, IBM, Lotus, Ashton-Tate, Microrim,Tektronix, Novell, and 3Com are among those companies that useNorton-Lambert's Close-Up for customer support.andM;Training.andP;  People learn best by doing, and computers are no exception.andO;Remote access software enables a trainer to show users how to use thesoftware, then watch their progress by monitoring each of their screens.andP;  TheLAN version of this type of software is best used in a classroom situation,since it allows an any-to-any relationship, whereas a modem connection islimited to point-to-point.andP;  But users in branch offices are often at adisadvantage.andP;  While it is possible to corral users in the headquarters for atraining session, remote users are often left to figure out the softwarealone.andP;  If they could receive one-on-one training, their productivity wouldrise.andM;Remote access software is also helpful in follow-up training, or when a userclaims the network is &quot;broken&quot; because he doesn't understand how to printfrom WordPerfect.andM;Remote access software generally allows you to take &quot;snapshots&quot; and .movies&quot;of screens, so you can assemble a presentation to teach users how to use aparticular application or resource.andP;  For example, you could assemble atutorial to teach people how to enter orders.andP;  A session capture feature isalso handy for later review and troubleshooting.andM;And because most have a &quot;chat&quot; capability, the user and support person cancarry on a conversation over the computer.andM;Network management.andP;  A natural extension of the support application isnetwork management.andP;  Some network management programs, such as Brightwork'sNetRemote, are set up specifically for diagnostics.andP;  Some don't have thediagnostics themselves, such as Triton's Co/Session, but will let anotherprogram interrogate the modem.andP;  A network manager could use the file transfercapability to download new software releases to users or even remote fileservers.andM;Collaboration.andP;  As Norton-Lambert's de Mornay points out, remote accesssoftware is real time.andP;  It allows two people in different locations to workon a single document simultaneously.andP;  A lawyer reviewing a contract with aclient is nothing extraordinary, except when the lawyer is in San Franciscoand the client is in San Jose.andM;An editor and a writer would find remote access software useful, too.andP;  Forexample, LAN Magazine's freelancers send their articles in on a diskette ordump them into our Atex system or bulletin board.andP;  We then edit them and faxor overnight mail them back for the author's review.andP;  With remote accesssoftware, the editing process would become real time, which would greatlyreduce turnaround time.andP;  An editor and a writer could work on the same fileat the same time, no matter where they are located.andM;Working at home.andP;  Remote access software allows people the flexibility ofworking at home.andP;  This fits the growing trend of &quot;telecommuting.&quot; It alsomakes it easier to work weekends.andP;  It's easy to put a word processing file ona floppy to take home, but not a database.andM;Remote printing.andP;  Perhaps you need to get a sales report to headquarters.andO;You could print it at your office and drop it in overnight mail.andP;  With remoteaccess software, you could log into a PC at headquarters and print itdirectly to their printer.andP;  Or you could finish up that big report at home,then send it to the printer in the office.andP;  Remote access packages allow forprint spooling, both remote and local, by capturing the data at interruptlevel, so the application software doesn't know its printout is beingredirected.andM;Remote order entry.andP;  Because you can operate the application remotely remoteaccess software can be used for remote order entry.andP;  Any company with a largenumber of sales off ices or clients can have a PC that can dial into thecompany's database.andP;  Orders can be entered; inventory can be checked at anytime.andP;  Callers don't have to wait for a telemarketing person to enter anorder or look up an answer.andP;  For example, a distributor can call up amanufacturer's inventory database.andP;  Or a mail order house can locate itscustomer service and order department in a place where labor is moreinexpensive and plentiful.andM;File transfer.andP;  As mentioned, remote access software encompasses thefunctionality of communications software.andP;  So remote access software is ableto transfer files.andP;  Anyone who spends a great deal of time travelling willfind this invaluable.andM;If your modem does not support data compression, it is very handy to haveremote access software that does.andP;  Triton's Co/Session has a very efficientcompression algorithm that speeds file transfer considerably.andP;  A note ofcaution: Do not use data compression with files that have been ARCed, sinceyou will only increase the transmission time.andM;Background file transfer is a convenient feature that lets you set up a filetransfer, then switch back into your application.andP;  The file will betransferred (albeit more slowly) while you are working  in  your  foregroundapplication.andM;Using scripts, you can set up groups of files to be transferred.andP;  Forexample, you might want to send all sales reports at night when the telephonerates are lower, but send electronic mail every two hours.andM;Product demonstrations.andP;  Instead of going to a potential client, asalesperson can demonstrate a software package using remote access software.andO;The potential client will get a better feel for the capabilities of theprogram than a demo diskette can provide.andM;Terminal communications.andP;  Remote access software encompasses thefunctionality of communications software.andP;  This means it includes terminalemulation so you can connect with on line services, bulletin boards, andelectronic mail systems.andP;  If terminal emulation is your primary concern, youare probably better off with one of the communications packages, such asMicrocom's Relay Gold.andM;The Necessary ToolsandM;Before you get whipped up into a frenzy about the many uses of remote accesssoftware, you must know the limitations and the necessary tools.andP;  While mostof these packages may advertise running programs from home or on the road,advertising copy rarely meets reality.andP;  And while it is useful forinteractive work, such as entering numbers in a database, you wouldn't wantto write a long report using a word processor remotely.andP;  For myquick-and-dirty tests, I used a PC with a 1200-baud modem to dial into a PCwith a 2400-baud modem.andP;  Using WordStar remotely was as slow as typing at adumb terminal.andM;The worst part about remote access software is the terminology.andP;  Whilereading the documentation, I quickly became confused as to which PC was beingdiscussed, the one being called or the one doing the calling.andP;  Both Tritonand Dynamic Microprocessors Assoc.andP;  (DMA) call the PC with the program anddata being executed the &quot;host.&quot; The &quot;remote&quot; computer is the one that watchesand controls the host PC.andP;  So if I were at home and wanted to dial into thenetwork, my PC at home would be the remote and the PC in the office would bethe host.andP;  If I were a LAN support person, my PC would be the &quot;host&quot; and theuser's would be the remote.&quot; But then Triton and DMA call the remote and host&quot;Support&quot; and &quot;Application&quot; or &quot;Aterm&quot; and &quot;pcAnywhere,&quot; clouding the issue.andM;Norton-Lambert, who targets its product toward the support market, clearlydefines its halves.andP;  The support person runs the program called Support/ACS,and the customer runs the Customer/Terminal program.andM;We will refer to the PC that will be called as the host and the PC doing thecalling as the remote.andM;To access resources remotely, both PCs must be running the software.andP;  The PCscan have the software loaded and active, or loaded and dormant.andP;  Theadvantage to having it loaded in an inactive mode is when a user has aproblem, he can hot-key into the remote access software, and the LAN supportperson can help from the point where the trouble began.andM;The problem with keeping remote access software resident is one of RAM.andP;  Loadnetwork software, Word, and remote access software, and the PC doesn't havemuch RAM left.andP;  For example, DMA's pcAnywhere needs 192KB of RAM to run, butonly 45KB when it is left resident.andP;  The host portion of Co/Session requires51KB to 105KB of RAM; the remote portion requires 125KB.andP;  Keeping the remoteaccess software loaded in resident mode is most useful for new people whowill need a great deal of support.andM;Also, because such software must be RAM-resident, it prevents spontaneoususe, such as being able to dial into your PC because you forgot the one fileyou really, really needed to work on at home.andP;  If you want to dial into theoffice computer, you have to load the software every time you leave theoffice.andM;Two modem and two video cards are the necessary hardware.andP;  Remote accesssoftware operates by taking a snapshot of video memory, then taking anotherimage a few seconds later, and comparing the images.andP;  If something haschanged, the new image is compressed, error checked, and sent over the modemand telephone line to the other PC.andP;  it is then error checked again,decompressed, and displayed on the screen.andP;  Keystrokes are handled similarly.andM;You can dial directly into any PC with a modem on the LAN and accessresources stored on its hard disk or the file server.andP;  This is the simplest,but not the most inexpensive method.andP;  If you prefer, you can set up a sort ofremote access server.andP;  All users would dial into this PC, then get access tothe LAN.andM;Giving each user a modem is akin to giving each person a printer.andP;  Especiallyin a network, it doesn't make sense.andP;  Asynchronous communication serversallow several users to share a few modems via the LAN.andP;  With a comm server,you have to buy fewer modems, which means you can buy higher speed modems.andO;So instead of buying twenty 1200-baud modems, you can buy a couple  of 19.2K-bits-per-second modems.andM;On the low end, there are several software-only comm servers which allow anyuser on the network to share a few modems.andP;  A software-only comm server isgood for small networks that don't require high speed communications.andP;  Theseare programs such as Cross Information's (Boulder, Co.) LAN+Modem or ConceptDevelopment Systems'  (Kennesaw,  Ga.) Sparkle.andM;Once you need speeds faster than 9600 baud or need to share more than fourmodems, you are better off with a hardware-and-software comm server.andP;  Themost popular strategy incorporates microprocessors to handle thecommunications, thereby off-loading the CPUs of the workstations or serverson the LAN.andP;  Network Products (Pasadena, Calif.) makes the ACS2 which Novellresells.andM;When it comes to comm servers, there are three major standards: Interrupt 14redirection, Network Communications Services Interface (NCSI), and NetBIOS.andO;Interrupt 14 redirection, originally defined by IBM in 1984, has beenexpanded greatly; however, there are several slightly differentimplementations of this &quot;standard.&quot; NCSI was defined by Network Products, andit has gained credence by Novell's endorsement.andP;  IBM uses the NetBIOS API inits async comm server.andM;Don't pick a comm server before deciding on the remote access software.andO;Choose the software or terminal emulation software first, then see which commservers it is compatible with.andP;  For example, Datastorm just debuted a commserver version of its popular shareware Procomm.andP;  Procomm Plus works withseveral communications standards.andP;  Triton should ship an Interrupt 14compatible version of Co/Session by press time.andM;Other IssuesandM;1.andP;  Can you switch from data to voice and vice versa without having to hangup and redial? The voice-todata feature lets you call in through aswitchboard, or it lets the LAN support person talk to a user first, thenswitch the connection to the PC.andP;  As for data-to-voice, the support personmay decide that he needs to explain the procedure, rather than just show thebaffled user.andP;  With such a switch, he can just speak to the person.andP;  Doingthis requires that both the user and support person have a telephone and amodem connected to the same line.andM;2.andP;  is there a chat mode? Because the data-to-voice switch can be a delicateoperation, you may want to have a conversation with the user over thecomputer.andP;  You can explain how to use the software in real-time e-mail.andP;  Afew remote access packages, such as Norton-Lambert's Close-Up, allow you tomove the chat window to different parts of the screen.andP;  The advantage is youwill not hide the part of the application you are trying to explain.andM;3.andP;  is there a combination host/remote? A combination host/remote allows theuser to call the support person as well as the support person to call theuser.andP;  This is advantageous if the user knows he is going to need help, or ifyou want the user to be charged for the cost of the phone call.andM;4.andP;  What kind of security is provided? Put remote access software on yournetwork, and you immediately open yourself up to security breaches.andP;  Does thesoftware support passwords, dial-back capabilities? Can it lock the keyboardor blank the screen? Can you limit access to certain directories or drives?andO;The support person shouldn't be able to see all the user's data.andM;If security is a major issue, you may want to consider a comm server whichonly permits certain users to dial out.andP;  Crystal Point's (Bothell, Wash.)andO;LineLock, a modem security and accounting program, has been designedespecially to restrict who can access the network and outside resources.andM;5.andP;  Does it have a billing log? If you are using this software for usersupport, it should have a billing log, so that you can charge back the usersfor the support time.andP;  If you can enter the exact nature of the call, you maybe able to see what type of training is necessary.andP;  Brightwork's NetRemotehas an extensive user database.andM;6.andP;  is there a LAN version? If you use this software for training classes, itis useful to have both the LAN and modem versions of this software.andM;Some Remote Access SoftwareandM;Commtech Int'l.andM;2580 Cumberland Pkwy., Suite 150andM;Atlanta, Ga.andP;  30339andM;(404) 438-9999andM;PC Expert, $79.andP;  Additional modules,andM;$40.andM;DatastormandM;P.O.andP;  Box 1471andM;Columbia, Mo.andP;  65205andM;(314) 443-3282andM;Procomm Plus 5-pack, $595.andP;  EachandM;additional workstation, $79.andM;DCA/CrosstalkandM;1000 Holcomb Woods Pkwy.andM;Roswell, Ga.andP;  30076andM;(404) 998-3998andM;Remote2/Complete, $195.andP;  RemoteandM;-2/Host, $129.andP;  Remote2/Call, $89.andM;Dynamic Microprocessor AssociatesandM;1776 East Jericho Tpke.andM;Huntington, N.Y.andP;  11743andM;(516) 462-0440andM;pcAnywhere, $145.andP;  pcMacTerm, $99.andM;Farallon ComputingandM;2150 Kittredge St.andM;San Francisco, Calif.andP;  94704andM;(415) 849-2331andM;Timbuktu/Remote, $195.andM;Microcom Software DivisionandM;Still River Corporate CenterandM;55 Federal Rd.andM;Danbury, Conn.andP;  06810andM;(203) 798-3800andM;Carbon Copy Plus, $195.andP;  Carbon CopyandM;Mac, $150.andM;Norton-LambertandM;P.O.andP;  Box 4085andM;Santa Barbara, Calif.andP;  93140andM;(805) 964-6767andM;Close-Up Support/ACS, $245.andP;  CloseandM;-Up Customer/Terminal, $195.andM;Triton TechnologiesandM;200 Middlesex Tpke.andM;Iselin, N.J.andP;  08830andM;(201) 855-9440andM;Co/Session Support, $175.andP;  Co/SessionandM;Application, $125.andP;  Co/Session XL,andM;$225.andP;  Co/Session LAN, $495.andM;BrightworkandM;766 Shrewsbury Ave.andM;Jerral Center WestandM;Tinton Falls, N.J.andP;  07724andM;(201) 530-0440andM;NetRemote/Single Server, $350.andP;  NetandM;-Remote/Four Server, $695</TEXT></DOC>
