The high court ruled 8-0 that a male state court judge in Illinois charged with sex discrimination may be sued for damages by a woman whom he demoted and later fired as a probation officer.    Although the case decided yesterday involved only a state court judge, it is likely to apply to federal judges as well.    Reversing the June 1986 decision of a federal appeals court in Chicago, the justices refused to extend the traditional absolute immunity from lawsuits that protects judges in their judicial roles.    The opinion, written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, relied heavily on a dissent in the appeals court that said that absolute immunity is &quot;strong medicine&quot; justified only when there is &quot;very great&quot; danger that exposure to lawsuits will interfere with the quality of judges' decisions. In the Supreme Court case, Justice O'Connor said, &quot;The danger here is not great enough.&quot;    But while they aren't entitled to absolute immunity, judges in their administrative roles aren't exposed to wide-open liability. Like many other government officials, they enjoy a lesser degree of immunity that allows them to defend against lawsuits by showing that they acted in good faith.    Although the high court's ruling wasn't limited to instances of alleged sex discrimination by judges, the case was watched closely by women's groups that argue that sex bias is a problem in the courts.    Lynn Schafran, director of the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund's National Judicial Education Program, said there are a significant number of cases &quot;where judges have been disciplined for sexual harassment of attorneys and staff.&quot; Few of those cases, she said, resulted in suits against the judges or provided any redress to the victims of sex discrimination.    The court's decision may prompt more lawsuits against judges, a prospect that judges argue will have a chilling effect on the performance of their duties.    But Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law expert, said the ruling creates &quot;a fairly limited exception&quot; to judges' absolute immunity. Moreover, Mr. Tribe said, &quot;To the extent that this will induce judges, when they act as administrators, to be attentive to the constitutional rights of others . . ., I think that's healthy.&quot;    The suit against the Illinois judge was filed in 1982. A federal court jury found that the judge had discriminated against the former probation officer and awarded her $81,818 in damages. But a federal district judge threw out the jury's verdict, saying it wasn't supported by the evidence, ordered a new trial, and then ruled that the judge was entitled to absolute immunity. The appeals court agreed.    The Supreme Court sent the case back to the district court to decide whether a new trial is necessary and whether the judge should escape liability because of limited immunity. </TEXT></DOC>
