(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The judge who presided over PTL'sbankruptcy proceedings said he received threats during the case, andcouldn't understand why Jim Bakker's followers ``were interested inthat little, sawed-off runt.''   Rufus Reynolds, who retired Saturday at age 81 as a U.S.bankruptcy judge, was guarded by U.S. marshals during the bankruptcyproceedings as the FBI investigated the threats.   ``They didn't say, `I'm going to kill you.' They said, `TheLord's going to take you,''' Reynolds said.   ``I didn't know Christians could be so critical. They would justchew me out.''   When a woman called the bankruptcy court in Columbia, S.C., tofind out if he was a Christian, ``I said, `You tell her I was when Istarted this case, but now I plead the Fifth Amendment.'''   Reynolds said television ministries are ``wide open'' formismanagement or corruption.   ``I think Congress should pass a very strong act forcing the IRS... to make them comply with an accounting,'' Reynolds said. ``Wehave all kinds of laws protecting consumers. Religion is justanother consumer item, just the same as selling soap or washingpowders or aspirin.''   Reynolds also said he was amazed at the response to the travailsthat brought down Bakker's evangelistic empire.   ``What puzzled me was why people were interested in that little,sawed-off runt,'' Reynolds said.   Bakker, who resigned from PTL in 1987, responded Sunday, saying:``I am shocked to find Judge Reynolds so prejudiced toward us, andto hear of him making fun of us and the PTL partners. ...   ``He should not have tried the PTL case with these feelingsagainst us.''   The ministry filed for protection under federal bankruptcy lawsin June 1987, three months after Bakker resigned from PTL.   Two months ago, Reynolds ordered Bakker, his wife, Tammy, andformer aide David Taggart to repay PTL nearly $7.7 million inbenefits he found to be excessive. Last month, he approved the saleof PTL assets to a Canadian businessman.   Also last month, a federal grand jury indicted Bakker and formertop aide Richard Dortch on charges including fraud and conspiracy,accusing them of diverting more than $4 million in PTL money fortheir own benefit. Two other former PTL officials were indicted.   Upon his retirement, Reynolds sand he left the PTL casediscouraged and somewhat cynical.   From the beginning, Reynolds said he believed the only way tosave PTL was to keep it intact as a religious operation.   ``It's a one-purpose center, a religious center _ a wonderfulidea,'' Reynolds said. ``If Bakker had employed reasonable businessprinciples, just on an average, they wouldn't owe a dime.''   Reynolds said he was disappointed at the outcome of the case.   ``When you've had 40,000 cases _ at least; when you've hadsuccess in lots of them, the majority of them; when you take the onemost publicized, best known, and you make a failure, you can't feelvery good. It's that simple,'' Reynolds said.   ``I'm going to take a bath and forget about it,'' Reynolds said.``Someone asked me what was the best part of the whole case. I said,`Getting out.'''</TEXT></DOC>
