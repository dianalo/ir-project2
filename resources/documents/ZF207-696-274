Some do it to savethemselves or their company money, even though the potential penalties arefar greater than the money saved.andP;  Some do it to try out software that theylater buy.andP;  Some do it because it's so easy, since almost all Mac businesssoftware is not copy protected.andP;  Some do it out of ignorance because theydon't know it's wrong, while a few do it for a thrill because they do knowit's wrong.andP;  Whatever the motivation, the facts are that software piracy iswrong, it is illegal, and it can cause you and your company trouble you don'twant or need.andM;For individuals, the solution to the piracy problem is simple: Don't do it.andO;if you use only software that you've paid for, you won't break the law orexpose your company or yourself to danger.andP;  If you have any software on yourhard disk that you didn't acquire legitimately, erase it now and go out andbuy a legal copy.andM;For managers, software piracy is a thornier problem.andP;  The first step iseducation.andP;  You must make - and enforce - an antipiracy policy and ensurethat your employees understand that software piracy is illegal and will notbe tolerated.andP;  If you're going to make it a firing offense, make sureemployees knowandM;that they can be terminated for copying software.andM;Enforcement raises several problems.andP;  How do you police your employees tomake sure they are complying with your antipiracy directives? Afinancial-service company in New York has a team of auditors who inspectemployces'hard disks looking for pirated software and erasing it when it isuncovered.andP;  Should an employee try to hideandM;pirated software by encrypting it or otherwise disguising it, the auditorsare authorized to reformat the hard disk, and the employee is subject totermination.andP;  That is a no-nonsense antipiracy program with a strongenforcement aspect.andP;  Employces quickly learn that the company is seriousabout its antipiracyandM;stance and isn't just giving it lip service.andP;  Companies may devise a lessintrusive approach to enforcement, but they have to be willing to back uptheir antipiracy policy and follow through with appropriate and consistentpenalties for its violation.andM;The one drawback to a strong antipiracy stance is immediate expenses (asopposed to long- term expenses such as legal fees, fines, and damages).andP;  Yoursoftware budget may have to be increased.andP;  You also should allocate funds inyour budget for buying trial copies of software so employees aren't forced touse creative strategies such as piracy to try out programs.andP;  Check with thepublishers of often requested software to see if they offer site licensesthat can save you money.andP;  With a site license, you pay one fee for the rightto use as many copies of the software as you have computers in your business.andO;Many software publishers offer such programs, especially if their software isthe kind that needs to run on many machines to be useful (such aselectronic-mail software).andP;  The larger your installation, the more money youcan save with site licensing.andM;Software piracy is a serious problem.andP;  It's bad for software publishers, someof whom go out of business even though theirandM;products are widely used (illegally).andM;Its bad for programmers, who make less money and are less inclined to followup with new versions and new products if they think their chances offinancial reward are low.andP;  It's even bad for pirates themselves, who oftenandM;have their base nature rewarded and go unpunished, which makes their piracyeven easier the next time and slowly erodes their moral values.andP;  But it'smainlyandM;bad for legitimate software purchasers, who may lose support for theirprograms when the publisher goes out of business or who might not get a newversion because the programmer wasn't able to makeandM;enough money on the first one.andP;  So help stop software piracy now, startingwith yourself and your company.andP;  You'll be doing a lot of good for a lot ofpeople, including yourself.andM;PINSTRIPE PICKSandM;Here are some of the most-pirated products for the Mac.andP;  Check to see ifyou're using any of these products without having paid for all your copies,and either pay for them or erase them.andM;Pyro! (Fifth Generation).andP;  Most everyone loves the fireworks of this screensaver, but not everyone pays for it.andM;Findswell (Working Software).andP;  This utility lets you find things when youneed to the most: when the Open dialog box is confronting you.andP;  But it isn'tpart of Apple's system software, as some people seem to think.andM;MacWrite II and MacPaint 2.0 (Claris).andP;  Yes, earlier versions of theseprograms were free, but the latest ones are not.andP;  When Apple got out of thesoftware business, Claris brought out the new, improved, and more expensiveversions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
