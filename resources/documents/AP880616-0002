(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hackers penetrated a non-classifiedDefense Department computer network last month, rummaging throughdata at a Navy base, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and at leastone other center, the space agency said Thursday.   The break-in occurred the night of May 16 and lasted into theearly morning hours of May 17, but no damage was done, said HaskellG. O'Brien, the laboratory's manager of communications andcomputing network services.   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigatingthe details of this,'' O'Brien told a news conference.   It was unknown whether more than one person was involved or ifthe break-in was achieved from inside or outside the United States,O'Brien said. Unauthorized computer access is illegal, he added.   Thousands of computers are linked to the network at hundreds ofU.S. and foreign universities and research centers, includingmilitary research centers and other National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration offices, he said.   O'Brien described it as a non-classified network for sharingscientific information. The network, named ARPANET, is operated bythe Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.   He said he considered the incident serious because programs usedto design microcircuits could have been damaged and because ``ifsomeone burglarizes my house, I'm offended. If someone accesses mycomputer, I'm equally offended.''   ``The Department of Defense regards as serious any attempt togain unauthorized access to its computer systems,'' Pentagonspokeswoman Susan Hansen said in Washington. ``Let me assure you,however, that there is no indication that any classifiedinformation has been obtained by such hacker activity.''   The break-in was the third known violation of computer securityat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in two years, O'Brien said. Hecited a previously publicized August 1986 break-in by a West Germanhacker, or computer buff, and another last summer, in which theperpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.   O'Brien said the hacker in last month's incident first gainedaccess to the Pentagon network through another computer at anundisclosed location. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password _the name of a JPL employee _ to enter the lab's computer, he added.   The hacker then used the JPL computer as a conduit to enteranother ARPANET computer at Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland,where authorities noticed something was amiss and notified the JetPropulsion Laboratory, O'Brien said. He added that he didn't knowhow many other computers also were penetrated.   The lab's chief spokesman, George Alexander, initially saidmembers of the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, brokeinto the Digital Equipment Corp. computer at the laboratory, but helater retracted the statement.   ``We don't know for a fact that it was Chaos. ... There arethings that make us suspicious, but the bottom line fact is wedon't know,'' Alexander said.   ``They're not kids,'' Alexander said of the club's members.``They're adults. They are a worrisome group to American computerexperts. They're not just hackers doing pranks. They are groupwhose motives and aims are not entirely clear.''   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, WestGermany, that he was unaware of the break-in, but would check intothe matter further.   ``One thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is they (thehackers) didn't get into any classified data banks nor did they getinto any sensitive information in the lab,'' Alexander said.   Alexander said that as soon as the break-in was discovered, ``wepulled JPL out of the network.''   Several days after the break-in, Digital Equipment and JPLofficials ``rebuilt the system to make sure that if they (hackers)planted any viruses, we were not going to continue using theoperating system they had been mucking around with,'' he said.   A computer virus is a program surreptitiously inserted into acomputer to disrupt its normal program.   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-oldWest German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins weredetected in August 1986.   Targets included computers at JPL, the Air Force Systems Commandin El Segundo, Calif., and at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory inBerkeley, Calif.   In September, members of Chaos Computer Club announced thatyouths who weren't club members used home computers to break into aNASA computer information network used by at least nine nations,and that they obtained secrets about the U.S. space program.   The club said the hackers gained regular access to at least 20NASA computers between May and September 1987 through a flaw in thesecurity system.   At the time, NASA officials in Washington denied that secretinformation had been obtained through its computer network.</TEXT></DOC>
