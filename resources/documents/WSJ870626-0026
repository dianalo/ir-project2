The board voted to &quot;proceed immediately&quot; with the sale of the company's nonairline units and base a distribution to holders on the proceeds. While a firm payout couldn't be set, sources close to the company said that the amount likely would exceed $60 a share. Some estimates of the potential cash distribution were as high as $70 a share.    After the board meeting, the company also announced that Frank A. Olson, who succeeded Richard Ferris as Allegis chairman two weeks ago, would become president and chief executive officer of the United Airlines unit, succeeding James J. Hartigan, who resigned those posts and his seat on Allegis's board. Mr. Hartigan was named the airline's chairman. The company also said John L. Cowan, Allegis's vice chairman, chief financial officer and a board member, resigned.    The moves consolidate Mr. Olson's control over the United Airlines unit. Both Mr. Hartigan and Mr. Cowan were closely identified with Mr. Ferris, whose strategy for building a full-service travel conglomerate was rejected earlier this month by the Allegis board.    In addition to its non-airline units -- which include the Hertz rent-a-car business and Westin and Hilton International hotels -- Allegis also said it may sell the airline's computerized reservation system.    But the Allegis board apparently has decided at least for the time being against the idea of proposing any form of employee ownership of United Airlines. The company said an internal survey of United employees found what it characterized as insufficient support for such a plan.    Hinting strongly at impending cost cutting moves at United, Mr. Olson said one of the goals of the airline's new management will be to develop a &quot;realistic program&quot; for employee wage and benefit concessions and productivity gains. Such efforts are &quot;a must&quot; for United to compete effectively, Mr. Olson said.    Such a proposal, however, is likely to draw a storm of protest from employee groups, particularly the United pilots union, which has said it will offer concessions only if the company agrees to sell the airline to the pilots.    Mr. Olson said, however, that United's employees wouldn't be asked to accept wage and benefit levels comparable to low-cost carriers, such as United's rival, Continental Airlines.    Mr. Olson added that he has designated Washington, D.C., labor attorney Stephen E. Tallent to represent management at contract negotiations with all employee groups, and that Mr. Tallent will report directly to him.    Administrative and other overhead costs will also be examined for potential areas of savings, the new airline president said.    The program outlined, Mr. Olson told shareholders, &quot;is likely to result in an improved valuation of United Airlines in the marketplace.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Allegis shares closed at $89.75, down 12.5 cents. The board meeting ended after the market closed.    A source familiar with the Allegis restructuring said that the company decided to withdraw its $60-a-share cash distribution plan because it would have cost the company &quot;millions of dollars in financing costs.&quot;    Allegis would have been required to pay those costs out of proceeds from the sale of assets, leaving less money for shareholders.    The company hasn't decided what it will do with the airline. &quot;The plan is to first straighten out the labor issue,&quot; the source said. But current expectations are that shareholders will retain a stub for the airline that could trade as high as $60 a share, depending on 1988 earnings. A stub is a share created when a portion of company's equity remains publicly traded after a recapitalization or acquisition.    The 1988 earnings, the source said, will be boosted by &quot;cost savings at the managerial level right away&quot; and by reducing other costs. Dozens of other airline managers are expected to be dismissed in coming weeks. Yesterday's announcement of management changes &quot;is the beginning of a wider sweep of airline executives,&quot; the source said.    Allegis could eventually leverage the airline to provide additional cash to shareholders. But that would reduce the value of the remaining stub, the source said.    Mr. Olson, who was head of the company's Hertz rental car unit before taking over the top post, said he will stay with the airline &quot;as long as necessary to reorganize the management structure,&quot; and that a special search committee has been formed to identify a permanent replacement. The committee will be headed by board member and former astronaut Neil A. Armstrong.    Some current Allegis executives have been mentioned as possible candidates for the chief executive position. They include Joseph O'Gorman, senior vice president, corporate planning, and former president of Frontier Airlines; James Guyette, executice vice president, operations; and John R. Zeeman, executive vice president, marketing. </TEXT></DOC>
