WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Albert Gore Jr., hoping to set himselfapart from his rivals, accused Richard Gephart of flip-flopping onissues and Michael Dukakis of foreign policy inexperience in acombative debate Gore said signals the ``beginning of the mainevent'' in their presidential race.   Gephardt and Dukakis, who are battling the Tennessee senator inthe delegate-rich primaries across the South less than three weeksaway, came under attack almost immediately Thursday night andcountered in a series of testy exchanges.   ``It's quite natural he would launch an attack,'' Gephardt, theMissouri congressman, said afterward. ``He probably thinks I'mahead in the South and he's got to jump start his campaign to havea chance.''   With Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart included, the five candidatesdebated for two hours in a televised session with a heavy focus onthe South _ the major battleground of both parties' nominationfights before the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries. One candidate,Paul Simon, bypassed the event to concentrate on Minnesota andSouth Dakota, which have earlier contests.   A similar debate was scheduled tonight for the four remainingRepublican candidates.   But it was placed in jeopardy when Bob Dole withdrew Thursdaysaying he feared it would become a pep rally for Vice PresidentGeorge Bush, and Pat Robertson followed suit. That left only JackKemp to debate Bush, and sponsors said they hoped it would still goon _ with empty chairs on the stage for the absent contenders.   The Democratic debate contained what were some of the mostpointed exchanges among the candidates, most of whom have met eachother in more than 20 debates over the past year.   Gore came out swinging immediately, using the first question tocharge that Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, was withoutforeign policy experience and had said in a recent televisedinterview that he was willing to tolerate a ``Soviet client state''in Nicaragua.   ``I'm not going to sit here and listen to that,'' Dukakis shotback, denying he said or believed such a statement. ``If you'regoing to be president of the United States you better be accurate.''   Gore turned to Gephardt moments later, saying his calls fortough trade policies would invite a trade war and cost Americanjobs. But it was his accusations that the Missouri congressman hadshifted positions on a range of issues from Reaganomics to abortionthat drew a sharp rebuttal.   ``When you make a lecture on consistency, maybe you better takea look at your own record first,'' Gephardt said.   In a reference to the recently withdrawn GOP candidate, headded, ``Lately you've been sounding more like Al Haig than AlGore.'' Gore responded: ``That line sounds more like Richard Nixonthan Richard Gephardt.''   Gore clearly came into the debate eager to use it as anopportunity to battle the two contenders he views as his chiefopponents, while leaving Hart and Jackson relatively untouched.   Gore defended his strategy in talking with reporters later,saying consistency ``is a legitimate issue'' and the race had nowmoved into his territory.   Dukakis and Gephardt are the two winners so far in the 1988Democratic nomination race, Dukakis winning in New Hampshireearlier this week and Gephardt winning Iowa's caucuses the weekbefore.   Turning to Gephardt, Gore served warning, saying, ``I'm going tolay it on the line now Dick,'' and then accused him of voting inCongress against increases in the minimum wage, against aDepartment of Education and for tuition tax credits. In each case,he said, Gephardt has taken different positions now.   ``You voted for Reaganomics; now you say, well, where are youthis week on Reaganomics?'' Gore said.   Gephardt has acknowledged changing positions on some key issues,saying time and circumstances have changed. Meeting with reportersafter the debate, he said: ``All of us in public life should try tore-examine issues. That's what I've tried to do.''   Dukakis and Gephardt tangled amongst themselves some too.Dukakis said the Democratic rivals were surprised Gephardt had saidin New Hampshire he was proud to have voted for President Reagan'stax-cut bill ``when he'd said all over Iowa he was against it andonly voted for it as a last resort.''   The sharp exchanges left Hart and Jackson out of the spotlightmuch of the time. Hart at one point said he was not withdrawingfrom the presidential race despite critics who said he should.   Hart said that with Bruce Babbitt's withdrawal from the race,Hart was the only candidate left who had laid out his plans for afederal budget. ``Men, when are you going to produce yourbudgets?'' he asked.   Jackson, who has a strong following among black voters in theSouth and leads in polls of some Southern states, drew one of theloudest rounds of applause when he said the United States is makingproducts that consumers don't want.   At another point, stressing the need for government to help poorchildren and welfare mothers, Jackson said he was ``a graduate'' ofthe nation's underclass.</TEXT></DOC>
