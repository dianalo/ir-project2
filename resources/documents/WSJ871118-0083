The costly move, which was taken without union bargaining, shows that more than a year after it acquired Republic, Northwest is still having trouble meshing its two employee groups. The former Republic employees have been working at lower wages than Northwest employees, and that disparity has led to work slowdowns and even fights.    Officials of Northwest, a unit of St. Paul, Minn.-based NWA Inc., said that they instituted the pay raise to bring more &quot;peace and efficiency to the airline.&quot;    Yet even that gesture is controversial. A Machinists union representative said the airline is trying to &quot;divide and conquer&quot; by offering raises to only some of the 20,000 Machinists members at Northwest.    Northwest said it will give former Republic mechanics, stock clerks and aircraft cleaners pay raises of between 3% and 53%. The average raise will be about 10.4%. An entry-level mechanic who now is paid $9.33 an hour will receive $13.25 under the new scale, the company said. However, an entry-level aircraft cleaner's pay would rise slightly to $7.18 an hour from $6.82. The raises are effective Sunday.    The Machinists union had been seeking better wage parity for its members. But it wanted the airline to renegotiate the pay scales of all the former Republic workers at once. Northwest had said it would only negotiate contracts as they expired.    Guy Cook, who represents the Northwest chapter of the Machinists union, said that in the wake of the pay increases, the former Republic employees will receive Northwest benefits -- losing some benefits they had gained through negotiations at Republic and retained after the acquisition, which he called superior to Northwest's.    Contract negotiations between the Machinists union and the airline reached an impasse Nov. 4 after several months of talks.    Northwest said it is able to give the raises without union approval, under the Railway Labor Act. Northwest said the act allows it to impose contract changes 10 days after an impasse occurs.    The August 1986 Northwest-Republic combination has been one of the most troubled of the recent airline mergers. In addition to labor unrest, Northwest has had difficulty blending the former Republic routes into its own sprawling system. As a result, Northwest had the second-worst on-time performance of the major airlines in September, according to the Transportation Department. The airline was ranked the worst in passenger service complaints to the department for the past three months. </TEXT></DOC>
