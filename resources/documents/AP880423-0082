Arab and Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the hijackers were believed to have made their getaway in anAlgerian air force plane via the Syrian capital of Damascus beforedawn Wednesday.   The sources said the leader of the hijackers was believed to beIzzedine Hassan, a Shiite hardliner known to have been involved inthe 1985 TWA hijacking in which an American was killed.   ``Various diplomatic security and counter-terrorist agencies aretrying to keep track of the gang,'' one diplomat said. ``The menare believed to have gone underground with Hezbollah in a largelyShiite part of west Beirut where their trail is easily lost.''   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a pro-Iranian Shiite radicalmovement that holds Western hostages in Lebanon. Terry Anderson,the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, isamong their captives.   On Saturday, the hijacked Boeing 747 was still being examined atAlgiers airport by Algerian security men and aviation specialists.A Kuwaiti crew was standing by to fly it home as soon as theAlgerians give the go-ahead.   The United States, Britain and other Western governments havepaid tribute to the Algerians for negotiating the release of thelast 31 hostages without further violence. But they have criticizedAlgeria for allowing the hijackers to escape unpunished.   Flight 422, carrying 112 passengers, was hijacked April 5 on aflight from Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait. It landed first inMashhad, Iran, where 57 passengers were released. Then it went toLarnaca, Cyprus, where 13 captives were freed and two others werekilled. The plane flew to Algiers and upon touching down onehostage was released for medical reasons.   On Wednesday, after lengthy negotiations with Algerianauthorities, the remaining hostages were freed.   Algeria's state-run media rejected criticism as ``arrogant andhypocritical interference'' in the nation's internal affairs, andasked why the West did not display similar concern over ``stateterrorism'' carried out by Israel and South Africa.   The sources said Algerian negotiators worked out a meticulousand elaborate deal with the hijackers during the six days the planewas held at Algiers' Houari Boumedienne airport.   One diplomat, who received a continuous Algerian progress reportwhile the negotiations were going on, said the secret talks wereconcerned more with assuring the hijackers' unimpeded getaway thanwith the fate of the hostages.   ``While the plane was still on the ground in Cyprus, theAlgerians received a promise that the hostages would not be harmedon Algerian soil,'' the source said.   ``The Algerian negotiators thereupon allowed the plane to takeoff for Algiers and then took the hijackers at their word. Eventsproved them right.''   Whether the Algerians were right to observe their part of thebargain and help the hijackers escape after the hostages were freed``is essentially a philosophical question over the validity ofbargaining under duress,'' another diplomat said.   ``While we are appreciative of the Algerian efforts to avoidfurther bloodshed, we do not see eye-to-eye with them on this otheraspect of the problem.''   Algeria has repeatedly played the role of ``honest broker'' innegotiating the release of hijack and kidnap victims, including theAmerican hostages from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1981 and theTWA passengers in 1985.   Algerian officials said Algeria would forfeit its ability toplay such a role in the future if it was seen to doublecross one ofthe parties to a compromise.   The diplomats said they believed the hijackers may have beentaken to Damascus on Wednesday in a special plane carrying ahigh-ranking Algerian official, Mohamed Cherif Messadia, to theSyrian capital for talks with President Hafez Assad.   Messadia is generally regarded as the number two man in theAlgerian government after President Chadli Bendjedid. His presencemay have given the hijackers some assurance their aircraft wouldnot be intercepted enroute.</TEXT></DOC>
