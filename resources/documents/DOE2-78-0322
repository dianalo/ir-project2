Examination of the inheritance of restriction fragment lengthpolymorphisms (RFLP) detected by using probes for constant or variableregion gene segments made it possible to assign TCR{alpha} haplotypesto the 16 parents and 43 offspring of eight families studied. A totalof six RFLP, three for the constant region and three for variable regionsegments, were examined in the present studies. Most enzyme and probecombinations tested revealed no polymorphism and those finally selectedfor the study showed limited polymorphism in that only two or, in onecase, three allelic forms of the gene were seen. In spite of limitedvariability at this level, extensive heterogeneity was observed for thecombinations of markers present in haplotypes, suggesting that frequentrecombination events have occurred. Most strikingly, multiple combinationsof RFLP occurring in close proximity of the TCR{alpha} constant regiongene were observed in this study. A high recombination frequency forthe TCR{alpha} gene complex is further supported by the observation thattwo children, one in each of two families, inherited recombinant TCR{alpha}haplotypes.</TEXT></DOC>
