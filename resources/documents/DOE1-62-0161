Horizontal tracks were flown all along the Po Valleyfrom West of the City of Milan to well over the Adriatic Sea, with specialemphasis on a larger area around Milan. The main objective of these flightmeasurements was to find an eventual correlation between the coarse lightscattering particles (haze) and the photo-chemically produced ozone duringphoto-oxidation conditions. In addition, the large scale build-up ofthe photo-oxidants in this area should be established. Flights in Bavaria,north of the Alps, revealed a quite similar situation with respect topollution by ozone. Vertical profiles on both sides of the Alps gavealso similar characteristics with respect to ozone and haze distributionand showed rather extended and consistent photo-chemical ozone columnsbetween ground and the inversion layer. Above the inversion layer naturalbackground values of 30 -6- PPB were observed North - South crossingsover the Alps at 3000 - 5000 M altitude gave no evidence of dramaticchanges along the flight routes. Typical ozone values reached on sunnysummer days are 80 PPB over very large areas in general, which increaseto 100 - 150 PPB in areas influenced by city Plumes. There is a characteristicrelationship between visibility and ozone, though of different naturenear ground and at higher altitudes.</TEXT></DOC>
