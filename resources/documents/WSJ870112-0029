George Curley, president of Edmonton, Alberta-based Wardair, termed &quot;premature&quot; a Montreal newspaper report from Paris that said Wardair would buy 12 jetliners from Airbus at $65 million to $73 million (U.S.) each, or a total of $780 million to $876 million.    &quot;I won't deny that there's substance to the story,&quot; said Mr. Curley. He indicated that an announcement would be made in about a week.    Wardair, 62%-owned by Max Ward, the company's chairman, currently operates three Airbus A-300 aircraft that it purchased secondhand. The expected sale would broaden Airbus's foothold in the Canadian market. Canadian airlines in the past have purchased mainly U.S. planes built by Seattle-based Boeing Co., St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed Corp.    The expected purchase of the Airbus planes comes in the midst of a brewing shakeout in the commercial airplane manufacturing industry, brought on by McDonnell Douglas's recent decision to build a new jumbo jet, the MD-11. A spokesman for the aerospace and defense concern said, however, that Wardair is seeking wide-body twin-engine aircraft, and, &quot;Since we don't make that kind of aircraft we weren't in the bidding.&quot;    A spokesman for Airbus in New York said he couldn't comment on the stage of negotiations with &quot;any airline.&quot;    The contract had been expected to be announced during a visit to Canada by French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac that had been set for this week. Mr. Chirac postponed his visit to Canada because of labor unrest in France.    The newspaper report also said Canadair Ltd., a Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer, would help build and maintain the planes. A spokeswoman for Canadair, a subsidiary of Bombardier Inc., also said the report was &quot;premature.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
