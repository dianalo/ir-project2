The freezing of production at the current level of 15planes, which is expected to be announced by the Pentagonshortly, gives B-2 opponents an important political advantageand increases chances that Congress will permanently cut offproduction money for the imperiled bomber during Pentagonbudget debates this spring. The decision is especiallydamaging to champions of the bat-shaped bomber in the Senate,who fought intensely during the summer and fall to save theprogram by hammering out compromise language and ensuringthat there would be funds to continue expanding the fleet.</LP><TEXT>   The House voted to bar production of any new planes, andRep. Ron Dellums (D., Calif.) and other senior members of theHouse Armed Services Committee have threatened to file suitif the Pentagon crosses that line. Now, Air Force SecretaryDonald Rice has decided to accept the House position andDefense Secretary Dick Cheney is expected to formally approvethe scaled-back production next month.   While a big chunk of the $4.1 billion approved by Congressfor the current fiscal year will be eaten up by cost overrunson previously authorized B-2s, prime contractor NorthropCorp. is trying to play down the significance of theanticipated lapse in production funding. The companyemphasized that immediate cutbacks in its work force won't benecessary beacause the assembly line already is working atreduced speed and can rely on a multibillion-dollar cushionof previously authorized planes. Oliver Boileau, presidentand general manager of Northrop's B-2 division, likens theeffect to &quot;a rubber band {that} just stretches&quot; theproduction timetable.   But at the same time, company officials acknowledged thatthey are preparing for a do-or-die debate on the B-2. To tryto show that an $850-million-a-copy Stealth bomber remainsrelevant in the post-Cold War world, they have come up with anew presentation to Congress and other groups that stresseshow valuable it would be against Iraqi troops.   The White House originally requested more money for theB-2 than any other weapons system in fiscal 1991, and itthreatened to veto any defense spending bill that didn'tinclude production money for new planes. Barely two weeksago, some industry insiders were convinced that positionwould prevail. But after consulting with the new Air Forcechief of staff and the general who has been named to takeover as the head of the Strategic Air Command, Mr. Ricedecided to throw in the towel on providing seed money foradditional planes in the current fiscal year.   For any manufacturer trying to pin down cost and hiringschedules, the questions surrounding the B-2 make long-termplanning nearly impossible. &quot;I've never seen a period ofgreater uncertainty than we have now,&quot; said C.G. King,executive vice president of Boeing Co.'s military airplanesdivision, a major B-2 subcontractor. &quot;It's awfully difficultto plan.&quot;   The B-2 now accounts for more than half of Northrop'srevenue, and building a fleet of 75 B-2s would cost well over$65 billion. Still, many analysts believe that Northrop andits B-2 subcontractors would be better off if the Stealthprogram were killed outright, rather than dribbling out oneor two planes a year. Cancellation would entitle Northrop toreceive large termination payments, even though it could takeseveral years to collect them.   Besides mounting problems with the B-2, Northrop facescancellation of another of its major defense programs. Thereis widespread talk in the Pentagon that the Northop-builtTacit Rainbow radar-destroying missile, which has performedpoorly in tests, will be killed as part of theadministration's fiscal 1992 budget request.</TEXT></DOC>
