Morrison-Knudsen International Co. will join with Hazama-GumiLtd., one of Japan's largest civil engineering firms, to build an18-story office and residential tower for Shuwa Corp., a largeJapanese real estate firm.   The company, a division of Boise, Idaho-based Morrison-KnudsenCorp., has established an office in Tokyo and obtained a Japaneseconstruction permit, which the Ministry of Construction says onlynine U.S. construction firms currently possess.   Amid complaints that Japan's construction market was closed toforeign companies, the Japanese government signed an agreement inMay 1988 to allow U.S. companies to participate in public worksprojects here.   Richard E. Kohne, chairman and chief executive officer ofMorrison-Knudsen, said this will be his firm's first project inJapan, although it has operated in many countries abroad. He saidMorrison-Knudsen would receive between 15 and 35 percent of the workin the project.   In looking for a Japanese partner, he added, Morrison-Knudseninterviewed a dozen potential contractors and chose Hazama because``they are the closest in traditions and culture with our company.''   Shuwa President Shigeru Kobayashi said his company had promisedformer U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity it would help U.S.firms participate in the Japanese market.   During the last two years, Shuwa has actively sought U.S. clientswith the help of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S.Embassy in Japan, Toshihiko Okino, a spokesman for Shuwa, said.   The office tower project is Shuwa's second contract with a U.S.firm for work in Japan. In March, it awarded an 11.2 billion yen,$80 million, contract to a joint venture between the Turner Corp.and Kumagai Gumi of Japan.   Shuwa plans at least two more projects in which it will inviteU.S. firms to participate, Okino added.   Shuwa also owns $2.5 billion in office and hotel space in theUnited States, making it one of the largest Japanese owners of U.S.real estate. </TEXT></DOC>
