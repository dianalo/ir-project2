The idea was to toughen his body for the return to Annapolis. &quot;He was always jumping off his roof and his garage,&quot; recalls Howard Rhodes, a neighbor. &quot;He said next he would take a survival course where he would have nothing to eat, no matches, that kind of thing.&quot;    Even in those days, Oliver North was full of dreams of guts and glory. When other midshipmen went home for Christmas, he would head for special military training camps -- paratroop jump school at Fort Benning, Ga., for instance. In the years since, he has thrown himself at projects with the same daring and ferocious intensity that once propelled his body off the roof. But the Marine officer's emergence as a central figure in the Iran-Nicaragua scandal has made increasingly clear what some long-time associates say they have long suspected: Lt. Col. North's boundless determination hasn't always been accompanied by sound judgment.    &quot;He's a great American, and he liked to get things accomplished, but what he lacked was overall perspective and understanding of the American character and traditions,&quot; says Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, who reviewed many North plans.    Mr. North's unfettered ideological zeal and his penchant for covert foreign-policy activism seemed to personify Ronald Reagan's foreign policy -- from invading Grenada and bombing Libya to mining Nicaraguan harbors and forcing down an aircraft full of hijackers. But in the end, the exploits of the intrepid Marine, whom Mr. Reagan has hailed as a &quot;national hero,&quot; have gravely wounded the very foreign policy he symbolized.    Despite Col. North's extreme zeal, he was no loner. He lived by the chain of command and strove to please his superiors. At the National Security Council, where he worked 16-hour days, his intensity was manipulated by his superiors -- and became recklessness -- as he relentlessly pursued the Reagan administration's secret plan to sell arms to Iran in exchange for American hostages and to funnel the profits to the Contras in Nicaragua.    No cause made Col. North's juices flow more than the plight of the Contras, who engaged his strong ideological and romantic notions. In his tiny National Security Council office, he kept a shoe box filled with photographs of the rebels, who are battling against Marxist Nicaragua's vastly superior military machine. Yet he once confided to a friend that he admired Thomas Borge, the most hard-line of the Sandinista leaders, whom he says he met several times. He claims that Mr. Borge jokingly referred to him as &quot;comandante&quot; but that Mr. Borge also personally escorted him out of the country in late 1985, driving him to Managua's Sandino airport to put him on a plane.    While the 43-year-old Col. North continues to say privately that all his actions were authorized, he has remained publicly silent about his motivations and methods since President Reagan fired him from the National Security Council last month. But friends and former colleagues paint a picture of a man who throughout his life has nurtured a series of close relationships with male authority figures, including athletics coaches and military bosses. To many of these men, Oliver North -- college boxing champion, war hero and fast-track Marine officer -- was the perfect surrogate son.    His high-school track coach in upstate New York, Russell Robertson, recalls the young Mr. North as a selfless team player who willingly would exchange his role in individual events to help the relay team. &quot;He was a kid you would like to have for your own,&quot; says Mr. Robertson's wife, Evelyn. Two decades later, Col. North took time out from his hectic Security Council schedule for the retirement party of another mentor, Emerson Smith, his Annapolis boxing coach. Col. North read a glowing tribute he had asked President Reagan to write about the coach. Mr. Smith, who attended Mr. North's wedding, says, &quot;Ollie's like a son to me.&quot;    At the Security Council, which Col. North joined in 1981, his father figure was Robert McFarlane, the national security adviser and fellow Marine. Mr. McFarlane would listen patiently to his steady stream of ideas for freeing the hostages or aiding the Contras, offering praise, advice or admonitions. In the spring of 1984, when the Contras' fortunes were flagging, for instance, Col. North suggested to Mr. McFarlane that the Contras set up a provisional government in order to increase their credibility with Congress. Mr. McFarlane approved the idea and passed it on for further study to the State Department bureaucracy, where it disappeared.    But Col. North enjoyed no such rapport with Adm. John Poindexter, who replaced Mr. McFarlane a year ago. Colleagues say Col. North found Adm. Poindexter aloof and distant, and objected to his plodding, cautious style. Adm. Poindexter, for his part, tried to have Col. North returned to the Marine Corps -- only to see the plan scuttled, in part because of right-wing pressure from North supporters who leaked the plans to columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak.    Meanwhile, in January, President Reagan signed an intelligence &quot;finding&quot; authorizing for the first time direct shipments of U.S. arms to Iran. The finding deliberately structured the operation in a way to keep it secret from the State and Defense departments and from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    Under these circumstances, it isn't certain that Mr. McFarlane would have made any difference had he remained at the Security Council. Indeed, although Mr. McFarlane has said he expressed reservations about the Iran program before leaving the government, he did agree last May to undertake a secret mission to Tehran in another effort to exchange arms for hostages.    But without Mr. McFarlane, Col. North had only one mentor left among senior administration officials: William Casey, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The colonel had easy access to the director. Last March, when the U.S. began naval maneuvers to intimidate Libya, it was Col. North who called Mr. Casey and had him paged at a golf course to relate the latest news. Mr. Casey also shared Col. North's passion for the Contras.    Col. North's involvement with the Contras dates back to 1982, when he was assigned to the Security Council's Central America &quot;account.&quot; The crusade was tailor-made for the driven young Marine, who never took a vacation during his five years at the Security Council. He quickly came to view support of the government of El Salvador against leftist rebels and the cause of the Contras against the Marxist Sandinistas as integral parts of the so-called Reagan Doctrine, which promotes the &quot;rollback&quot; of Soviet expansionism across the globe.    In late 1983, he escorted the bipartisan Kissinger Commission, which was reviewing U.S. Central America policy, on a trip to the region. One panel member recalls how, following a Managua briefing for panel members from Sandinista officials, Col. North took the floor and told the panel that the Sandinistas' use of Cuban and Soviet-bloc maps and military manuals during the briefing and their Cuban-type military structure proved them to be Communists bent on conquering the region.    Colleagues say Col. North seemed always to have the ability to improvise under pressure. One of them recalls that when Col. North found out that Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger objected to the plan to force down an Egyptian airliner carrying the Achille Lauro terrorists, he persuaded his Security Council superiors to initially order the White House operators not to disturb President Reagan with telephone calls. (Mr. Weinberger and the president eventually spoke over an unsecured line while Mr. Reagan was aboard Air Force One and Mr. Weinberger was on another aircraft.)    But when Col. North later was helping provide aid to the Contras, his intensity and tendency to improvise would cloud his judgment. According to the testimony of other U.S. officials, for example, he used his own name on secret Swiss bank accounts, dealt with unsavory middlemen who may have taken huge profits and, violating a cardinal rule of &quot;compartmentalizing&quot; covert operations to ensure maximum security, reprtedly used former Air Force Gen. Richard Secord, an old associate, in both the Iran and the Contra operations.    Col. North appears to have been driven both by his personal passion for the Contras and by a lifelong desire to work hard to please his superiors. Some family friends associate this desire with what they describe as a warm and affectionate relationship with his late father, Oliver Clay North, a decorated World War II veteran. &quot;One reason {he} went into the service was that his father had,&quot; says Thomas Gibbons, a former Philmont neighbor. And Mr. North's mother, Ann, adds that &quot;his father was a wonderful example for military patriotism and community values.&quot;    A devout Catholic, young Oliver put in extended duty as an altar boy at Sacred Heart Church in Philmont. &quot;Usually, once a kid gets in high school the altar boy {activity} stopped,&quot; says Mr. Gibbons, who lived across the street from the Norths. &quot;But he stayed on longer, until he was a senior.&quot;    So it wasn't surprising to those who knew him from Philmont that, in one of his few public comments since the arms scandal broke, he referred reporters to the Scriptures. As he left his home one day earlier this month, he expressed disappointment that he had &quot;found myself abandoned by former friends and so-called friends and colleagues,&quot; and added: &quot;I would refer you to Psalm 7, verse 1.&quot;    The Psalms verse reads: &quot;O Lord my God, in Thee do I put my trust; save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
