Rangoon radio said the shootings occurred Tuesday. It and otherofficial media have described most of those killed since the coupas looters or other ``destructive elements.''   Soldiers are imposing strict rules against public gatherings andlooting. Vendors, gamblers and others who once crowded thesidewalks of Rangoon have disappeared.   Civil servants and factory workers reported to their jobs forthe third day but many left by early afternoon, apparently becauseof a lack of work in ministries and state enterprises crippled by along general strike. All government employees were ordered back towork Monday under threat of dismissal.   Two new youth organizations, the People's Youth Federation andthe All Burma United Youth Organizations, registered as politicalparties Wednesday with a commission that is to supervise elections.The political leanings of the two groups were not immediately known.   Three main opposition political parties have registered _ theDemocracy Party, National League for Democracy and People'sDemocracy Party _ but have not said whether they will participatein the elections.   Burma's most powerful party, widely believed to be backed by thenew government, has not registered because of its ``complicatedposition,'' party sources said Wednesday.   The National Unity Party, under another name, was the only legalparty for 26 years of repressive military rule and operated withgovernment funds. It has been ordered to divest itself ofgovernment assets like all other parties.   Party sources said this would prove difficult because theorganization, formerly called the Burma Socialist Program Party,had substantial holdings in real estate and other fixed assetsacquired all or in part from government funding.   Under a Sept. 27 decree, political parties that use state funds,vehicles and other property cannot apply for registration.Financing for the Burma Socialist Program Party included $10million to $13.3 million annually in government funds.   Western diplomats say Gen. Saw Maung and his new government backthe National Unity Party but are observing legal requirements in anattempt to quiet anti-government feelings.</TEXT></DOC>
