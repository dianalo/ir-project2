The addition of varying quantities of kaolin,quartz sand, and other products to the base is discussed from the standpointof optimizing such properties as ultimate compression strength and thermalconductivity. X-ray diffraction is used for structure analysis. Implementationof the ceramic as an insulating material in furnaces operating at temperaturesup to 1300 degrees C has shown an appreciable increase in thermal efficiencyover current materials.</TEXT></DOC>
