Michael Byrnes, Manila-based correspondent for the Australian Financial Review, is being allowed to stay in the Philippines following a decision by Foreign Affairs Secretary Raul Manglapus to suspend the order indefinitely. &quot;There is no deportation. Period,&quot; Mr. Manglapus said. However, Mr. Manglapus left open the possibility of reinstating the order by saying he would personally review Mr. Byrnes's article that triggered the events leading up to the order.    Some Western diplomats said they believe Mr. Manglapus will let the matter die. Mr. Byrnes is scheduled to move to Hong Kong before year's end.    The foreign secretary's decision dissipated at least temporarily a credibility crisis that exposed a serious gap in the government's ability to make policy and decisions. Mr. Manglapus said he wasn't aware of the expulsion order until after it had been issued. Neither was Press Secretary Teodoro Benigno, who ordered the lifting of the directive. The immigration commissioner at first complied, then learned Mr. Benigno lacked authority to issue such an order.    According to Mr. Manglapus, the order was the work of bureaucrats acting on the recommendation of the country's ambassador to Australia. Last month, Mr. Byrnes wrote a commentary in which he alleged the Philippines was the most corrupt country in Asia. Ambassador Romualdo Ong objected to the story.    According to Mr. Manglapus, Mr. Ong sent Manila a message urging that the Australian journalist be deported. Mr. Manglapus said his department's visa section acted on the request. </TEXT></DOC>
