But commission officials wouldn't comment on an AsahiShimbun report that they have concluded there was aprice-fixing cartel and that they plan to issue anadministrative order to the ink makers. The officials alsorefused to comment on the newspaper's report that they won'tseek criminal charges in the case.</LP><TEXT>   Citing industry sources, the newspaper said officials frommore than 10 ink makers decided at a meeting in a Tokyo hotelin August 1990 to coordinate price increases for theirproducts. In the case of one type of printing ink, the reportsaid, the increases were to range from 70 yen to 120 yen (54to 93 U.S. cents) a kilogram, depending on color. Japan'sindustry last year produced 400,000 tons of printing ink, thereport said. A kilogram is 2.2 pounds.   A spokesman for Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals Inc., one ofJapan's biggest ink makers, confirmed that its offices weresearched by commission officials last March but said thecompany hasn't been notified of the investigation's findings.He declined to comment further.   If the companies are found to have raised pricesillegally, they probably will have to pay penalties based onsales since the price increases took effect.   U.S. trade officials have been pressing for tougherantitrust enforcement in Japan. Some complain that collusivepractices in their home market have given Japanese industriesan unfair advantage in international trade while blockingaccess to Japan by foreign competitors.   Separately, following up on earlier promises made to theU.S., the commission recommended that the maximum criminalpenalty for illegal cartels be raised to several hundredmillion yen from the current five million yen ($38,600).</TEXT></DOC>
