While business leaders welcomed the central bank's move tocut the rate -- the fee at which it lends to private banks --by half a percentage point to 5%, many said the bank shouldease credit further.</LP><TEXT>   The stock market reacted to the cut with disappointment.On Wednesday the market had buzzed with rumors that thecentral bank would announce a cut of three-quarters of apoint or more. After the announcement, which came just beforeThursday's market opening, the Nikkei average of 225 stocksdropped 239.69 points to close the day at 24176.54. Volumewas thin, with an estimated 230 million shares changinghands.   Japan's economy continues to expand more rapidly than thatof any other major industrial nation. But since the beginningof the second quarter, most indicators have suggested thisnation's once-robust economy has slowed considerably. Almostall of Japan's important economic statistics have now tiltedin the same direction, though without the same severity, asthose of struggling economies in the U.S. and Europe.   Consumer prices appear to have stabilized, housing startsin the first nine months of this year fell more than 20% froma year earlier, money-supply growth is slowing, andbankruptcies are up nearly fourfold from last year.   Japan's economy has entered into a &quot;Japanese-stylerecession,&quot; says Kermit Schoenholtz, an economist at SalomonBrothers Asia Inc. He predicts that the economy will expandabout 3% in the fiscal year ending next March 31 and only2.5% the year after. Last year, it grew 5.7%.   Mr. Schoenholtz ascribes the slower growth to a variety ofnegative trends including a dulling of the once-voraciouscorporate appetite for new plant and equipment and sluggishdemand in Japan's major export markets.   &quot;We'll see continued weakness in domestic demand into 1992and no recovery in private sector spending until the secondhalf of the year,&quot; Mr. Schoenholtz says.   Not all analysts agree with such dour sentiments, however.Paul Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming SecuritiesLtd., says Bank of Japan policy makers have performedflawlessly since Yashushi Mieno assumed the governorship twoyears ago. Mr. Summerville predicts Japan's economy will growabout 3% this fiscal year and a healthy 3.4% in the yearending March 31, 1993. This week's rate cut, he contends, isthe latest in a series of carefully planned steps aimed atbringing about sustained inflation-free growth beginning nextyear.   The Bank of Japan cut the discount rate by half apercentage point in July, reversing more than two years oftight money policies. It has allowed short-term rates to fallsince September, and it has loosened reserve requirements forthe nation's banks. The central bank injected liquidity intothe economy last month when it began repurchasing governmentbonds. The repurchase operation was expected to free up aboutabout two trillion yen ($15.37 billion) of capital.   &quot;He's a magician,&quot; Mr. Summerville says of the centralbank's governor. &quot;There's no panic. This is a good economy,and it's run by some very smart people.&quot;   Even optimists, however, predict the Bank of Japan willlower rates again by March. Many also expect Prime MinisterKiichi Miyazawa to call for the government to acceleratespending on roads, ports, bridges and other forms of publicinfrastructure early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
