Low-cost, two-wayvideo links, for example, could bring top educators intorural classrooms.   But even lawmakers who support the call for deregulationare beginning to wonder if the regional phone company reallymeans it.</LP><TEXT>   At issue is Southwestern Bell's response to a request toinstall a three-mile link between an educational networkserving isolated high schools in rural western Kansas and theDodge City school system. Southwestern Bell says it would beglad to oblige -- at a price of about $200,000 for a fiberoptic line.   The educational cooperative that runs the network refusedSouthwestern's offer. Instead, the cooperative is talkingwith tiny Pioneer Telephone Co., an independent based inUlysses, Kan., about running in a coaxial cable for around$45,000. It is also looking at installing a fiber line at aslightly higher price.   Southwestern Bell insists that Pioneer's setting up of thecable would violate government regulations because the Stateof Kansas hasn't authorized Pioneer to provide video servicein that market.   This action by Southwestern Bell is particularly strikingas the company and its six Baby Bell telephone siblings renewtheir multimillion dollar lobbying campaign to liftrestraints on their businesses. The consent decree that brokeup the Bell System in 1984 bars the giant phone companiesfrom providing long-distance service, manufacturing phoneequipment and owning information services, such as sports,news and horoscope programs obtained over phone lines.   Unchained, the Baby Bells say they could bringinexpensive, cutting-edge services to their communities. Arecent advertisement, for instance, shows three youngstersintently watching a professor on a television screen. To oneside, a TV camera is trained on the three. &quot;America'sstudents could have low-cost access to the nation's leadingscholars over existing telephone lines,&quot; the advertisementreads. &quot;But government restrictions limit their choice.&quot;   Nothing in the consent decree, however, bars the phonecompany from building advanced interactive networks foreducation or any other use. And the Dodge City case hasraised concerns on Capitol Hill about whether the Bells'lobbying campaign is based on empty promises of using theirnetworks to help rural and disadvantaged Americans.   Among those taking notice are Sen. Robert Dole and otherrural lawmakers, who have long supported easing the consentdecree restrictions. &quot;A significant factor has been thepromise of technology delivering new services to ruralAmericans,&quot; says a top Dole aide. &quot;Ironically the Dodge Citysnafu is a particular concern.&quot;   Richard Veach, Pioneer's general manager, disagrees withSouthwestern Bell's interpretation of the rules, and may goahead and install the line through a separate, unregulatedsubsidiary. He blames the old Bell System mentality. &quot;Beforethe breakup, they would tell you, `This is what we've got.This is what it costs. If you want it, that's the price.' TheBell-shaped head still exists.&quot;   Southwestern says it no longer uses coaxial cable, anddoesn't want to install anoutdated technology. &quot;We don't havemuch experience with it anymore,&quot; acknowledges Russ Phelps,Southwestern Bell's regional account manager in Topeka.Besides, he says, optical fiber lasts longer and can carryfar more video, voice and data signals. &quot;Some consider{coaxial cable} almost an obsolete technology,&quot; he says.   Costs to the schools could be cut only if businesses orother institutions could share the fiber path into DodgeCity, Mr. Phelps says. But there are none, and fiber-opticsgets costly when others can't share the charges, he says.   And in defense of Southwestern Bell's public spiritedness,Mr. Phelps talks with pride of educational networks thecompany has already built and notes it already participatesin the network that educators want to connect to Dodge City.One school network, he says, &quot;hired a German teacher who canteach at all schools.&quot; The same network, he says, has been sosuccessful that plans are being made to expand it toelementary schools. The consent decree, he complains,prevents the Bells from developing technology that wouldallow it to bring down costs for its services.   In any case, lifting the consent decree would have littleimpact on the Dodge City dispute.   The schools now face contracting to build and maintain theDodge City connection -- and possibly own it themselves.Southwestern Bell has been cordial but unyielding, says DonNigus, director of the educational cooperative that runs thenetwork. &quot;I don't think the phone company is looking at otherways the fiber can be used,&quot; Mr. Nigus says. &quot;I can't believethat within a few years there wouldn't be multiple users ofthat fiber.&quot;   Mr. Veach of Pioneer argues: &quot;The idea is to get the jobdone, not to argue over advanced technology.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
