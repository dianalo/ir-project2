After all, you must remember that 'bazaar' is a Persian word {meaning market}.&quot;    Since the Islamic revolution, 'bizarre' has often seemed a better word for Iran's odd mix of business fundamentals and religious fundamentalism. For example, when a Tehran assembly line worker decided reading the Koran was more important than working, his manager had to agree, or risk the ire of revolutionary enforcers. Also unlucky was the engineer whose job interview included more questions on how to shroud a Shiite corpse than how to combat concrete creep. He didn't get hired.    Now, for the first time in 10 years, entrepreneurs are optimistic that money-making, rather than the mosque, will drive Iranian economic policy. Iran's President-elect Hashemi Rafsanjani, a businessman as well as a mullah, has signaled that economic reform will be his priority.    To succeed, he will have to overcome both Iranians' aversion to the West, and the West's paranoia about Iran. The Chamber of Commerce's Mr. Ravan, who has a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, typifies the contradictions still tearing Iran. Finishing a sales pitch about the bonanza awaiting foreign consumer-goods companies, he reminds his visitor: &quot;If you want spiritual peace, it is enough to have one television set.&quot;    ---   A clean shave and a silk tie may go over well on Wall Street, but at Khomeini Square in Tehran, the dress-for-success crowd favors a three-day growth and a tie-less collar. Beards are a sign of Islamic humility, neckties a hated emblem of Westernization. Says one clean-shaven businessman: &quot;If I grew a beard it would be easier for me to get a bank loan,&quot; because all banks are owned by the Islamic state. But he shaves because Iran's surviving capitalists also network, shunning deals with those who look too fundamental.    Iranians doing business with the West have image problems enough, even without stubble. When Manouchehr Talebian, owner of a castings factory, signed a contract for delivery of a metal-melting furnace from England, start-up supervision was part of the contract. But Western technicians, scared of being seized by religious zealots, won't come to Tehran. &quot;They offered me my money back instead,&quot; says Mr. Talebian, who finally persuaded a lone Englishman to come by providing sanctuary in his Tehran home.    This year, Mr. Talebian was set for a business trip to London when the Salman Rushdie affair erupted, closing the British Embassy. He hadn't yet picked up his visa. Applying to go to West Germany instead, he found that relations with that country had chilled as well.    Because of such blips, Iran isn't exactly swimming in the international business mainstream. A recent issue of Iran Exports magazine details the country's participation at trade fairs in commercial hubs such as Gabon and Beirut, and describes new trade ties with Algeria, Kenya and Bulgaria.    &quot;Bulgaria? Ecuador? Give me a break,&quot; exclaims a Western diplomat in Tehran. &quot;These guys aren't interested in Bulgarian technology. But they're looking for partners that won't bother their political bosses.&quot;    ---   Iran's recent change of bosses, however, already is signaling that the country is opening up -- even to tourists. The State Foundation for the Disabled has gone into the tourism business, organizing groups from Syria and India. And Mr. Rafsanjani has negotiated a trade deal with the Soviets, whom the ayatollah long called a &quot;satanic force.&quot;    A few Iranian exporters wouldn't even mind getting back into bed with the U.S., the Great Satan. Iran Poplin Co., a maker of bedsheets, boxer shorts and other textiles, had burgeoning sales in America before a U.S.-imposed trade ban in 1987 abruptly shut off the market. The company has turned to Europe but is hedging against further diplomatic snafus by doing market research in Africa.    &quot;You have to keep cool and calm,&quot; says Abdol-Reza Bajelan, Poplin's export manager. There are 160 countries with which he could do business, he notes. &quot;If 20 or 30 of them stop you, others are always available.&quot;    The U.S. ban also cut sales of Persian carpets, which account for half of Iran's annual non-oil exports of $1 billion. In Tehran's covered bazaar, Mehdi Segatchi unfurls a century-old Isfahan carpet. &quot;I could sell this for $15,000 in America,&quot; he says. &quot;If only I could sell it in America.&quot;    Before the ban, the U.S. accounted for 15% of his sales. He even had his own shop in Utah, now closed. His one remaining American customer is an Iranian-born carpet-seller who is stockpiling rugs with Mr. Segatchi for future sale at his store in Memphis, Tenn. &quot;When the ban goes, my business booms,&quot; says Ali Taghavi, who owns a shop in Chickasaw Oaks Plaza. &quot;Even in Tennessee they appreciate fine carpets.&quot;    ---   And even in the Islamic Republic, they appreciate greenbacks. On Tehran streets, the cry &quot;change money dollars&quot; is heard almost as often as the call to prayer. The government doles out hard currency only for essential imports, forcing companies to buy dollars on the street, at up to 20 times the official exchange rate. In Iran, though, black marketeers don't hide in dark corners. Hundreds crowd the sidewalk a few doors from the Central Bank, clutching plastic bags bulging with banknotes, and shouting their rates like traders on the floor of the Chicago Merc.    &quot;Every time Mr. Rafsanjani appears on television, the dollar drops,&quot; says Mohammed Mamoudzadeh, a currency dealer in the bazaar. The leader's sensible comments on the economy give confidence, he says. But so far, the currency has continued to edge back up to its wheelbarrow rate of over 1000 riyals to the dollar.    As an accountant, Sargon Amirkhas finds all this hard to explain to his international clients. For one thing, the item usually labeled &quot;interest&quot; on a balance sheet is listed in Iran as &quot;bank expense&quot; or &quot;guaranteed profit&quot; to avoid an Islamic prohibition on usury. Business deductions are hard to claim because black market purchases, which often account for half a company's costs, don't come with official receipts and therefore aren't recognized by the state. And Mr. Amirkhas's numbers-crunching still is done by hand in ledgers, rather than by computer.    Despite the Byzantine bookkeeping, he prefers accounting to other businesses in Iran, which are subject to the state's fickle attitude towards profit and private property. &quot;If your capital is on your body, they can take it away,&quot; he says. &quot;If it's your brain, how can they take it?&quot;    These days, the state is trying to give back some of the assets it seized in the heat of revolution. One industrialist was offered his aluminum factory -- plus the debts it had amassed under state control. He declined.    ---   Iran's war-ravaged infrastructure also takes a toll. In the laboratory beside Mr. Talebian's factory, there are two machines measuring metal hardness. One is a sleek electronic tester from England; the other, a bulky mechanical East German version. Mr. Talebian keeps both because the electronic one is too sensitive to Tehran's frequent power outages and surges.    A nearby wax-molding shop is staffed by women who wear Islamic headscarves and take meal breaks in a separate cafeteria. Otherwise, Mr. Talebian's foundry isn't that different from counterparts in Cleveland. He anticipates a strong recovery as Iran rebuilds after the devastating war with Iraq.    But most Western managing directors don't have to double as forklifts. To cut down on the red tape that tangles all imports, Mr. Talebian often returns from business trips hefting spare parts and tools. Trying to avoid crippling excess-baggage charges on a recent flight from Europe, he hauled aboard an overnight bag containing 55 pounds of pneumatic grinders and hammers.    &quot;Someone walked into it by accident and almost broke his toe,&quot; he says. Fortunately, he adds, &quot;I have insurance.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
