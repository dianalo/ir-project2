We believe in an America, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy,that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weaponsfor hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missionsin Lebanon and Honduras, not by relaxing our vigilance on theassumption that long-range Soviet interests have permanentlychanged, not by toasting a tyrant-like Marcos as a disciple ofdemocracy, but by maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficientto counter any Soviet threat, by standing up to any Americanadversary whenever necessary and sitting down with him wheneverpossible, by making clear our readiness to use force when force isrequired to protect our essential security commitments, by testingthe intentions of the new Soviet leaders about arms control,emigration, human rights and other issues, and by matching them notmerely in rhetoric but in reciprocal initiatives and innovation, injoint efforts to combat environmental threats, explore peacefuluses of space and eradicate disease and poverty in the developmentworld, and in a mutual effort to transform the arms race thatneither side can win into a contest for people's minds, a contestwe know our side will win.   We believe in following up the INF Treaty, a commendable firststep, with mutual, verifiable and enforceable agreements that willmake significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way thatdiminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower; reduceconventional forces to lower and equivalent levels in Europe,requiring deeper cuts on the Warsaw Pact side; ban chemical andspace weapons in their entirety; and halt all nuclear weaponstesting while strengthening our efforts to prevent the spread ofthese weapons to other nations before the nightmare of nuclearterrorism engulfs us all.   We believe in an America that recognizes not only the realitiesof East-West relations but the challenges and opportunities of thedeveloping world; that will support and strengthen internationallaw and institutions, promote human and political rights andmeasure them by one yardstick, and work for economic growth anddevelopment. We believe that we must provide leadership, compassionand economic assistance to those nations stunted by overwhelmingdebt, deprivation and austerity, and that we must work to promoteactive agreements between developing and industrial countries, andthe major public and commercial lenders, to provide debt relief andrekindle and sustain economic growth and democracy in LatinAmerica, Asia, and the poorest continent, Africa, which deservesspecial attention. We further believe that we must enlist the tradesurplus nations to join with us in supporting new aid initiativesto fuel growth in developing countries that, though economicallydepressed, are rich in human and natural potential.   We believe this country should work harder to stop the suppliesof arms, from both East and West, that fuel conflict in regionssuch as the Persian Gulf and Angola.   Deeply disturbed that the current administration has too longabandoned the peace process in the Middle East and consistentlyundermined it in Central America, we believe that this country,maintaining the special relationship with Israel founded uponmutually shared values and strategic interests, should provide newleadership to deliver the promise of peace and security throughnegotiations that has been held out to Israel and its neighbors bythe Camp David Accords and to Central America by the Arias PeacePlan, which calls for an end to the fighting, nationalreconciliation, guarantees of human rights, democracy, andsecurity, enabling the United States and other nations to focus onthe pressing social and economic needs of the people of that region.   We further believe in pursuing a policy of economic cooperationinstead of confrontation with Mexico and our other hemisphericfriends; in helping all developing countries build their ownpeaceful democratic institutions free from foreign troops,subversion and domination and free from domestic dictators andaggressors; in honoring our treaty obligations; and in using allthe tools at our disposal, including diplomacy, trade, aid, food,ideas, and ideals, to defend and enlarge the horizons of freedom onthis planet.   We believe in an America that will promote human rights, humandignity and human opportunity in every country on earth; that willencourage free speech and association and decry oppression innations friendly and unfriendly, Communist and non-communist, thatwill encourage our European friends to respect human rights andresolve their longstanding differences over North Ireland andCyprus; that will encourage wherever possible the forces ofpluralism and democracy in Eastern Europe and that will support thestruggle for human rights in Asia.   We believe the apartheid regime in South Africa to be a uniquelyrepressive regime, ruthlessly deciding every aspect of public andprivate life by skin color, engaging in unrelenting violenceagainst its citizens at home and promoting naked aggression againstits neighbors in Africa.   We believe that the time has come to end all vestiges of thefailed policy of constructive engagement, to declare South Africa aterrorist state, to impose comprehensive sanctions upon itseconomy, to lead the international community in participation inthese actions, and to determine a date certain by which UnitedStates corporations must leave South Africa.   We further believe that to achieve regional security in SouthernAfrica, we must press forcefully for Namibia's independence bycalling for the end of South Africa's illegal occupation, a ceasefire and elections, must end our counterproductive policy in Angolaand must offer support and further assistance to Mozambique andother frontline states.   In sum, we believe it is time for America to change and moveforward again in the interest of all its families _ to turn awayfrom an era in which too many of America's children have beenhomeless or hungry and invest in a new era of hope and progress, anera of secure families in a secure America in a secure world.   We believe the American dream of opportunity for every citizencan be a reality for all Americans willing to meet their ownresponsibilities to help make it come true.   We believe that governments at the national, state and locallevel, in partnerships between those levels and in partnershipswith the private sector, exist to help us solve our problemsinstead of adding to them. We believe in competent, pragmaticgovernments, accountable to the people, led by men and womendedicated not to self interest but to service, motivated not byideology but by American ideals, governing not in a spirit of powerand privilege but with a sense of compassion and community.   For many years, in state and local capitals across this nation,Democrats have been successfully solving problems and helpingpeople with exactly this kind of innovative government.   Therefore, the Democratic Party in convention assembled andunited, the party of hope and change and fairness for all, herebydeclares its readiness to end the stalemate in Washington bychallenging, encouraging and inviting the American people _challenging them to do their patriotic best to meet their communityresponsibilities, encouraging them to protect and preserve theirfamilies, our most precious assets, and inviting them to join withus in leading the land we love to a brighter and still greaterfuture of opportunity and justice for all.</TEXT></DOC>
