<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-1216 </DOCNO><TEXT>Decays of neutron-rich isotopes in the rare-earth region were studiedby means of on-line mass separation and {beta}-{gamma} spectroscopy usingmultinucleon-transfer reactions between beams of /sup 136/Xe (9 and 11.7MeV/u), /sup 186/W (11.7 and 15 MeV/u) and /sup 238/U (11.4 MeV/u) andtargets of /sup nat/W and Ta. The higher beam energies appear to be advantageousfor the production of such isotopes. Two new isotopes were identified:/sup 177/Tm with a half-life T/sub 1/2/ = 85+-10/15 s, and /sup 184/Luwith T/sub 1/2/ {approx_equal} 18 s. A new 47 s-activity found at A =171 is tentatively assigned to the decay of the new isotope /sup 171/Ho.The properties of the ground and excited states of neutron-rich lanthanideisotopes are interpreted within the shell model using the deformed Woods-Saxonpotential. A change of the ground-state configuration for odd-mass neutron-richlutetium isotopes from {pi} 7/2/sup +/ [404] to {pi} 9/2/sup -/ [514]is suggested, this change being due to the influence of a large hexadecapoledeformation. The role of a possible isometric state in /sup 180/Lu forthe nucleosynthesis of /sup 180m/Ta is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
