Not anymore. Police are increasingly turning to cash rewards andmorbid crime re-enactments on television to lure John Q. Public tothe phone.   The police-sponsored ``Crime Stoppers'' genre, most familiar as60-second spots on local TV, took a giant leap toward Hollywood lastweek with broadcasts of ``Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare.''   With help from an independent film company, Seattle policeinvestigators created two hours of televised murder, mayhem andmystery in a plea for clues to the country's worst unsolved serialmurder case: the ``Green River'' slayings of at least 40 women inthe Northwest.   The syndicated program, distributed to 137 stations nationwide,included a re-enacted murder attempt, real footage of policeunearthing a victim, and interviews with grieving relatives. Viewerswere urged to turn in a crook _ and maybe collect a $100,000 reward.   ``The show was designed to push an emotional button in theviewer,'' said producer Beth Broday.   It apparently did. The program, broadcast Dec. 7 and repeatedduring the past week, drew more than 7,600 calls to a toll-freehotline.   Investigators rejoiced at the flood of fresh tips and praised themarriage of sleuthing and the media.   ``It's the most effective tool in law enforcement,'' declaredDetective Myrle L. Carner, director of Seattle's Crime Stoppersprogram.   The popularity of such programs reflects a ``get tough on crimerevival,'' said Art Lurigio, assistant professor of psychology atNorthwestern University and co-author of a 1986 study on theprograms for the U.S. Justice Department.   ``People are looking to have some impact on crime, alleviatetheir fears, and regain some control,'' said Lurigio, although hecautioned ``there may be some negative consequences.''   Offering large cash rewards and anonymity may encourage falseaccusations, and the nightly re-enactments could unnecessarilyincrease fear of crime, Lurigio said.   Crime Stoppers began 12 years ago in Albuquerque, N.M., whenpolice and civic leaders decided they needed a new weapon to fightincreasing crime. The premise: grab attention with a televised``Crime of the Week'' re-enactment, then promise cash rewards andanonymity to anyone reporting any serious crime.   The concept took off. More than 600 U.S. communities now haveCrime Stoppers programs, said Tim Kline, a retired Albuquerquepolice officer and president of Crime Stoppers International, whichhelps set up local programs.   Crime Stoppers tips have helped solve more than 210,000 feloniesand led to the recovery of $1.3 billion in narcotics and stolenproperty, Kline said.   In the last two TV seasons, networks and syndicates have createddramatic variations on the Crime Stoppers theme. Not only are theprograms popular with viewers, they also are successful. Of 115fugitives portrayed on Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's MostWanted,'' 55 are in jail, Fox says. NBC says its ``UnsolvedMysteries'' has broadcast 50 stories and helped solve 11 cases.   On Wednesday, authorities in Nevada arrested a man suspected ofbilking investors of up to $3.5 million after they were tipped offby a maid who found a note in his motel room saying, ``The UnsolvedMysteries program was a bombshell.'' The show had featured his caseNov. 30.   The police behind last week's ``Manhunt'' program hope thesuccess rubs off on the maddening Green River case.   More than $15 million has been spent hunting for the killer,whose first victims were dragged from the Green River, south ofSeattle, in 1982. The murderer now is officially blamed for thedeaths of 40 women, most linked to prostitution and street life.   The killings stopped in 1984, but investigators say the murderermay have moved on. They're studying whether he might be responsiblefor at least some of the slayings of more than 30 transients andprostitutes since 1985 in San Diego. And the discovery of six femalebodies near New Bedford, Mass., since July, some of them believed tohave been prostitutes, prompted police speculation that the killerhad crossed the country.   During ``Manhunt,'' viewers were urged to report clues not onlyto the Green River case, but to any serious crime in the country.   Calls came in from every state. At least two people said theywere the Green River killer. Several others said the killer hadconfessed to them.   Some calls were pranks, and many offered information too dated orgeneral to be helpful. Investigators said it will take weeks to sortthrough the 3,000 tips that seem initiallly promising.   One tip already has produced results, albeit unrelated to theGreen River case. Police said two murder suspects were arrestedSaturday in Seattle and taken to jail.   Surprisingly, that's where many tipsters are, too.   ``We get a lot of calls from jails,'' said Carner. ``The oldsaying that there's no honor among thieves is true. They love to raton each other.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   David Foster is the AP Northwest regionalreporter, based in Seattle.</TEXT></DOC>
