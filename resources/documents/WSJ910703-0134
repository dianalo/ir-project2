That truth, of course, hardlymakes the Reagan years unusual. Every newly elected politicalleader comes into office proclaiming a mandate to transformgovernment policies.   Ronald Reagan, however, was the first president sinceFranklin Roosevelt to open his term with a powerfulideological vision of the role that courts should play increating and enforcing the new political order, and it isthat legal dimension of the attempted revolution that makesMr. Fried's inside account such a compelling read.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School, served forfour years as President Reagan's solicitor general, whichmeans that he was the administration's principal appellatelawyer, responsible for briefing and arguing cases in theSupreme Court of the United States. Since the battlements tobe stormed were those of the Supreme Court, the SG wasnecessarily at the head of the phalanx.   The Reagan Revolution in the legal system had little to dowith &quot;judicial restraint&quot; or &quot;the original understanding&quot; orany of the other worn code words. Rather, the ReaganRevolution was largely about urging on the courts particularsocial policy views as constitutional imperatives and, wherepossible, appointing federal judges who would be willing toenact those same policy views into fundamental constitutionallaw.   As Mr. Fried's book makes starkly clear, the legal arm ofthe Reagan Revolution, in an eerie resemblance to much of theleft legal handiwork that it sought to undo, proceeded asthough in every case the correct constitutional answer to aproblem was the same as the correct policy answer. All judgeshad to do was follow the prescriptive norms of judging (the&quot;intention of the framers&quot; was a biggie), and most of theReagan social agenda would, like Warren Court interpretivemagic, turn into constitutional law.   On such controversial social issues as abortion andaffirmative action, for example, the view of the politicallycorrect revolutionary in the Reagan years was that the firstwas not a constitutionally protected choice and the secondwas an unconstitutional horror. Some of the book's mostfascinating moments come as Mr. Fried details what he insistswere his determined efforts -- not all of which succeeded --to moderate the more radical constitutional schemes of someof the true believers at the top of the Justice Department.   Mr. Fried, who makes clear his own distaste for absolutes,neatly skewers the view that requiring judges to remainfaithful to the original understanding is somehow a panaceafor all the problems of discretion in judging. Much of thebook amounts to a readable and provocative essay onconstitutional interpretation, and while every reader willfind something in it to dispute it is, in the end, the mostthoughtful and engaging defense of the Reagan legal agendathat the interested reader is likely to find.   To be sure, readers unfamiliar with the issues will likelybe baffled by some of the fine distinctions Mr. Fried draws,especially on the issue of executive authority over theindependent agencies and, perhaps, on the intricacies ofaffirmative action as well, where the subtle differences thatseparate Mr. Fried from members of Attorney General EdwinMeese's inner circle (the Holy Office, he calls it) are notthe stuff of which comprehensible sound bites on the eveningnews are made.   But to Mr. Fried, the differences are crucial. Throughoutthe book, he is at pains to make clear that he is not whatused to be called a Reaganaut. For example, Bowers v.Hardwick, the decision in which the Supreme Court sustainedGeorgia's anti-sodomy law, becomes &quot;stunningly harsh anddismissive,&quot; and the underlying statute &quot;is either animposition of very great cruelty or an exercise in hypocrisyinviting arbitrary and abusive applications of the criminallaw.&quot; Not a bad description, perhaps, of either the decisionor the statute -- but from the Reagan Revolution's chiefappellate lawyer?   Nor are his portraits of his Justice Department colleaguesuniformly flattering. No one takes it on the chin harder thanWilliam Bradford Reynolds, the head of the Civil RightsDivision. Mr. Reynolds, we are told, &quot;proposed a constantstream of suicidally radical and unconvincing projects,&quot;which Mr. Fried professes he was reluctant to press beforethe Court. &quot;After a confrontation with him,&quot; he confides,&quot;you needed a stiff drink and a long walk.&quot;   Still, much of Mr. Fried's discussion of the inner workingof the Justice Department is thin, perhaps for understandablereasons of confidentiality, a concern to which he alludes inthe book's final pages, when he asks the reader -- orperhaps, his own conscience -- whether he has done somethingwrong by recounting, so soon after the fact, internaldeliberations. I do not propose to answer his question forhim. I do think that had he chosen to stay silent, ourunderstanding of the revolution, its failures as well as itssuccesses, would have been impoverished.   ---   Mr. Carter is William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law atYale.</TEXT></DOC>
