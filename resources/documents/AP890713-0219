(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Like a lot of couples, Matthew and PamelaSchultz taught their teen-age sons the family business. It wasn'tyour typical Mom-and-Pop operation _ the Schultzes were into robbery.   For William, 16, and Matt, 15, the tools of the trade wereAK-47s, police scanners, surveillance and survival gear, maps, wigs,even hypnosis, police say. They were trained in hand-to-hand combat,went through daily routines of jogging, situps and pushups, andmemorized streets, zones and police codes.   There were dry runs and days of scrupulously logging policemovement.   Files police found in a rented home near Sarasota includedblueprint-like drawings and maps showing distances to police andfire stations, hospitals, malls, railroad terminals and streetsleading to interstate highways.   After a job, the two teens would be hypnotized and debriefed.   ``Some sessions were more detailed than others,'' said DetectiveBob Drone in Kenneth City, 50 miles north of Sarasota. ``The reasonwas if any mistakes were made during a robbery they could becorrected before the next one.''   One mistake the Schultzes made cost them; they pleaded guilty inTennessee to a botched robbery and drew a 10-year prison sentence.   Documents police found in the house left no doubt the Schultzesthought of it as a business. There were ledger entries forexpenditures. A contract dealt with firearm purchases, handling ofloot, and standards of behavior.   ``No greed will be tolerated for personal use and pleasure,'' itwarned, according to investigators.   Police don't know much about the family. Schultz, 29, was at onetime a trucker. His 35-year-old wife was a onetime exotic dancer andwas married to a Rochester, N.Y., man named Hinton, who fathered theboys and since has died.   The Schultzes told their landlady, Stella Penney, they were Mattand Pat Avery last September when they rented the three-bedroomcountry home she owned on 10 acres near Sarasota. They said they'dbe there two years.   Schultz told Mrs. Penney he was a Marine on special assignment atMacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, 70 miles away. ``I wasn'tsuspicious. I didn't know they were criminals,'' she said, addingthat the boys were polite, but didn't seem to go to school anddressed mostly in military clothes.   Over the months, Mrs. Penney grew wary of Mrs. Schultz, whodemanded several days' notice before the landlady could visit, thenwas rude to her. ``I was getting kind of scared of her. The otherswould come around and apologize, make excuses for her that she washaving a bad day or the like.''   The first police knew of the Schultzes was a six-month spree ofrobberies and burglaries that began in the Sarasota area in May1988. On Nov. 26, the Schultzes sat outside a Kenneth Cityrestaurant while the two teens and a runaway they had picked up took$3,000-$4,000 at gunpoint, Drone said.   On Dec. 1, Mrs. Penney got the November rent. ``Matt opened hiswallet and I saw a stack of big bills, two inches thick. It wasloaded; there were hundreds. I said, `What did you do, rob a bank?'''   Schultz said no, then told her he was going to Tampa on businessand would be back in a few weeks. But the family fled.   ``It looked like they got out in a hurry,'' Mrs. Penney said.They left behind two big dogs, their clothes and a $300 electricbill.   Gone were the stove, dining room table and fans, and the carpetwas ruined. One bedroom was painted in military camouflage colors. Abarrel on the wooded lot had been used for target practice andlooked like swiss cheese. Shots had been fired into the barn. Emptyammunition shells were scattered around and there were threehomemade obstacle courses in the front yard.   Scared by a local crime-reenactment TV show, the Schultzes headedhome to Churchville, N.Y., starting back south in January orFebruary, police say.   They made it as far as Red Bank, Tenn., outside Chattanooga,where police nabbed the two Schultz boys and a runaway from New Yorkafter the botched armed robbery of a businessman as he made a nightdeposit, said Sgt. Dan Dyer.   Police recovered all but $110 of the $1,180 cash and $300 inchecks. Some was stashed in a motel light globe and $300 was in arefrigerator drip tray, he said. ``The light globe had been linedwith tissue paper so the money was not visible even when you shineda flashlight on it. Some of the stuff was ingenious.''   Police confiscated an AK-47 and 750 rounds of ammunition, a.45-caliber pistol with 130 rounds, an automatic rifle with 300rounds, magazine clips and a number of military-type knives, Dyersaid. ``They had enough weapons and ammo to keep us held off thebetter part of a week.''   The Schultzes pleaded guilty last month to the robbery. A judgesentenced the adults to 10 years to run concurrently with anysentence in Florida. The boys' unspecified sentence is to beparallel and concurrent to Florida's.   The family was extradited last month and pleaded innocent July 7to charges stemming from three shoe-store robberies, one each at acomputer software store and a yogurt shop, and burglaries of arestaurant and three schools.   Matthew and Pamela Schultz and William Hinton, now 17, face 24counts each of conspiracy, robbery with a firearm, burglary andgrand theft. Each is being held on nearly $500,000 bond. Matt Hintonwas indicted by a grand jury on 19 counts as an adult and is beingheld on $200,000 bond.   They are to be tried Oct. 23.   Police traced the family to the rented home and found shotguns,ammunition and 60 pounds of spent shells. They also seized athree-inch-thick file giving more than a glimpse into the carefullyorchestrated, resourceful operation that included runaways theadults brought into the fold.   The contract they found reads in part:   ``Any and all firearms will be bought by the business and held bythe overseer for proper use.'' Stolen money would be ``cleaned andunmarked by overseer Matt.'' Big expenditures ``would not be allowedin one lump sum as it might be traced back.'' Anyone who took drugsor alcohol within seven days of a job would be excluded. Traceableitems had to be destroyed.   There also were individual's notes: ``three days ago, stoppedsmoking ... you can beat anybody but Matthew ... you are smart,smarter than the cops ... you feel no pain ... won't remember beinghypnotized.''   Jobs were carefully planned. For a grocery store stickup, theyfigured 20 seconds to open the safe, 15 seconds to grab the money,10 to get out followed by a 100-yard dash. Police were two-fifths ofa mile away. They had 36 seconds to run half the driveway with maybe12 stacks of money totaling 20-30 pounds.   ``They were big on changing appearances for different jobs,''Drone said, changing hair style and color, even dressing the boys asgirls. ``Here were parental figures training kids to commit violentcrimes. The biggest travesty is the effect on these kids probablyfor the rests of their lives.''   ``They used their kids,'' said Sarasota Sheriff's Dept. spokesmanCpl. Mike Bessette. ``That's the most unfortunate thing. The saddestand sickest part of this whole thing is that the actual victims hereare the kids.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs July 17</NOTE></DOC>
