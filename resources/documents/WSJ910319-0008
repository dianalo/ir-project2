Wilke   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/19/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B3</SO><CO>   DEC J.FUT</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)SOFTWARE (SOF)</IN><LP>   A Digital Equipment Corp. executive said Digital wouldenter the fast-growing market for massively parallelcomputers within a year.   Robert M. Glorioso, vice president, said &quot;Digital isworking on massively parallel computer architectures&quot; thatwould probably be aimed initially at scientific and technicalmarkets. He said Digital engineers have conducted extensiveresearch over the years in massively parallel computerdesign, in which scores or even hundreds of smallerprocessors are tied together to function as one computer.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's time to test this technology to see where it canreally play,&quot; he said in an interview. Despite a slow startin commercial markets, &quot;the whole industry is looking at itmore closely now.&quot;   Indeed, massively parallel designs are increasinglyovertaking conventional machines in raw power. In a closelywatched independent test disclosed yesterday by University ofTennesee researcher Jack Dongarra, a parallel computer byThinking Machines Corp. was declared the world's fastest. Ina widely accepted benchmark, the machine hit 5.2 gigaflops,or billion floating-point operations per second. AJapanese-built computer by Fujitsu Ltd. took second place.   Mr. Glorioso wouldn't be more specific about the Maynard,Mass.-based company's intentions, suggesting only that itwould involve what he called a &quot;systems approach&quot; rather thana single product. He added that software has long been abarrier preventing massively parallel machines from broadcommercial use and that Digital would concentrate more onsolving those problems than on any particular machine design.&quot;The hardware actually is the easy part,&quot; he said.   None of the major computer makers has a significantpresence yet in the massively parallel field. Smallercompanies, however, have found it an increasingly hot field,led by closely held Thinking Machines. Sales of theCambridge, Mass., company doubled to an estimated $60 millionlast year.   After a late start, Japanese companies also are investingheavily in massively parallel technologies. And whilecommercial applications have been slow to develop, somecompanies -- including Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The WallStreet Journal -- have used it to perform fast searches ofhuge electronic text libraries, or of consumer marketingdatabases. Scientific and engineering uses also areproliferating.   Mr. Glorioso's comments left the door open for a number ofdiffering approaches to the emerging market, including thepossibility of a joint venture. Indeed, Digital insiders hintthe company's first move could be a joint effort with MasParComputer Corp. The Sunnyvale, Calif., company is headed by aformer Digital engineer who worked on massively paralleldesigns within Digital before departing for California in1987. Digital also has done some joint marketing withThinking Machines, mostly in research markets.   Jeffrey Kalb, the former Digital engineer who is nowMasPar's president, wouldn't discuss what form any expandedrelationship with Digital might take except to say that &quot;wecontinue to talk about ways to work more closely together.&quot; AThinking Machines spokesman said the company continues towork with Digital on some joint sales.   Digital also unveiled as expected a line of&quot;fault-tolerant&quot; computers -- machines designed to keepcrunching numbers even if a part fails. They are used inbanking and other applications where a computer failure wouldbe seriously disruptive.   While some of the details of the announcement had beenreported, Digital still managed to surprise some analystswith the aggressive pricing of an entry-level model at just$46,000. Larger models range in price to as high as $1million fully configured.</TEXT></DOC>
