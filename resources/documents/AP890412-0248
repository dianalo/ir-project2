Some of the new machines, priced from $5,995 to $73,900, boastsophisticated new graphics and digital sound technologies, higherspeeds and a circuit board that allows full-motion video on acomputer screen.   Scott McNealy, Sun's president, said in a prepared statement therevamped line is another step toward bringing more powerful desktopcomputers into everyday business and personal use.   ``Tomorrow, people will be talking to, gesturing at, and evenarguing with these machines,'' he predicted, saying his newproducts reflect ``ease-of-use features found, before now, only inpersonal computers.''   Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greaterspeed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphicscapabilities.   The star of Sun's new product line is the SPARCstation 1, ``themost powerful, full-function computer for under $9,000,'' McNealyclaimed. The price does not include disk drives.   The machine's speed of 12.5 million instructions per second,MIPS, is about four times the speed of similarly priced high-endMacintosh from Apple Computer, and more than twice as fast as themost powerful IBM-compatible personal computers. Previously, theSun's fastest RISC machine had a speed of 7 MIPS for $22,000.   The new machine and the revamped older models are designed tocapture markets other than the traditional technical ones that foryears have relied on machines from Sun and rival Apollo Computer.The companies control about 50 percent of the workstation market.   ``This machine is the beginning of Sun getting into the volumemarket,'' said Richard Shaffer, editor of Techologic ComputerLetter.   Anil Gadre, Sun's director of marketing for graphics, predictedthe new products will help the company for the first time sell morethan 100,000 workstations in a single year.   But Kathleen Hurley, an analyst at the research firm ofDataquest Inc., said the power and prices of some of the newproducts are comparable to others available on the commercialmarket.   Sun is using the SPARC technology, its version of so-called RISC_ reduced instruction set computing _ in an effort to capture asignificant share of the burgeoning $4 billion workstation market.By the mid 1990s, the market for the machines is expected to beabout $20 billion annually.   Sun also plans to unveil during a two-day conference at the SanFrancisco Civil Auditorium a library of 500 software packages thancan be run on the new systems.   Other new products to be announced today include a revamp of theoriginal Sun-3 workstation line, with the addition of Motorola'sfast 68030 microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will startat $5,995; a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at$29,900; and an equally fast SPARC system starting at $40,900 thatis designed to operate as a ``server'' to interact with manycomputers on a network.</TEXT></DOC>
