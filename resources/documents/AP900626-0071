(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lithuanian President VytautasLandsbergis met with Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin today,then returned to his republic as its parliament prepared to debatea moratorium on independence.   Gorbachev invited Vytautas Landsbergis to the unannouncedmeeting, apparently to discuss Gorbachev's proposal that theLithuanian parliament pass a moratorium on its March 11declaration, said Haris Subacius, a spokesman in the LithuanianSupreme Council parliament.   An aide to Landsbergis also confirmed the meeting, but declinedto comment further.   Landsbergis returned later to Vilnius for a parliament debate onthe moratorium, which has been recommended by Lithuanian PrimeMinister Kazimiera Prunskiene.   ``The proposed temporary moratorium could save our dignity andat the same time promote the solution of the accumulatedproblems,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Mrs.Prunskiene as telling a news conference Monday.   Lithuania has been under an Kremlin economic blockade sinceshortly after its declaration.   Soviet authorities partially lifted the embargo by resumingnatural gas shipments to a Lithuanian fertilizer factory, amountingto 15 percent of Soviet gas deliveries to Lithuania. Crude oil andgasoline shipments remain cut and many Lithuanian businesses haveclosed, forcing thousands out of work.   The Lithuanian Council of Ministers, which Mrs. Prunskieneheads, accepted Gorbachev's proposal earlier this month.Landsbergis has been less inclined to compromise.   Gorbachev proposed the moratorium as a formula to enable him toopen talks with the secessionist republic and lift the economicembargo. Details are sketchy, but he appears to be seeking alongterm agreement with Lithuania and its sister Baltic states,Latvia and Estonia, to keep them as republics in a newlyconstituted Soviet Union.   His chances of forcing them to retain their old status, or toaccept recently passed Soviet rules governing secession, diminishedthis month when Russia, the largest Soviet republic, passed aresolution declaring its sovereignty.   Although the Russian declaration did not go as far as stepstaken by the three Baltic republics, it set the stage for thetransfer of many powers from central authorities to electedgovernments in the 15 Soviet republics.   Mrs. Prunskiene and some Soviet officials have been searchingfor a compromise to resolve the impasse.   Her popularity has been rising rapidly among Lithuanians duringthe crisis, compared with that of Landsbergis, who is losing favor,according to a poll released Monday.   It was conducted by the Sociological Research Department of theLithuanian Academy of Sciences and reported by Interfax, anunofficial news service of Radio Moscow.   Mrs. Prunskiene had a favorable rating among 61 percent of thosesurveyed, followed by the deputy prime minister and leader of thebreakaway Lithuanian Communist Party, Algirdas Brazauskas, with 50percent, the report said.   Landsbergis' rating has declined from 45 percent to 28 percentsince the independence declaration, it said.   Interfax did not report the poll's margin of error or say howmany people were contacted.   Despite signs of a compromise, the Lithuanian parliament hascontinued to pass and implement laws that seem likely to angerSoviet hard-liners.   On Monday, Landsbergis and other members of parliament receivednew Lithuanian identity cards, which are to be distributed laterthis week to all young men as a first step toward avoidingcompulsory service in the Soviet army, according to Tass.</TEXT></DOC>
