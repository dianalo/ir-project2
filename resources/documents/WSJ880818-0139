Rundle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CKP </CO><IN> INS </IN><DATELINE> PHOENIX, Ariz.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Usually, it's the element of surprise that makes crisis management so tricky. But Circle K Corp. is learning that even when a company makes its own crisis, and has time to prepare for it, the outcome can be devastatingly unpredictable.    Circle K, which operates 4,100 convenience stores in 27 states, is reeling after a weeklong uproar stemming from national publicity about changes in its employee health-care plan. The revision that sparked the controversy denied new employees medical coverage for illnesses and accidents related to &quot;personal life-style decisions&quot; -- namely, health problems resulting from acquired immune deficiency syndrome and from alcohol and drug abuse.    Circle K executives say they knew the move faced a rough reception from employees and the public when Karl Eller, the company's chairman and chief executive, first proposed it in mid-1987 as a way to control company medical costs. They prepared to deal with that response.    But even the executives concede that the story of how Circle K got caught flatfooted reflects sloppy planning, botched employee communications and misjudgment of public reaction. The debate, stirred by allegations that the new policy was a thinly veiled attack against homosexuals, has been aired on network television and on the front page of several newspapers. Last week, it led Circle K to suspend the plan pending review and possible revision -- perhaps even elimination.    &quot;We expected some heat, but not this,&quot; says Ray Cox, the Circle K senior vice president who has served as a sort of point man during the episode.    The changes were &quot;vague and ambiguous, and it seems the ultimate decision becomes a spur-of-the-moment corporate decision rather than firm policy,&quot; says Edward Buck, an Arizona activist who quickly emerged as a spokesman for the critics and who had been a leader in the successful campaign earlier this year to oust Gov. Evan Mecham.    It is typical of Circle K that the policy was proposed by Mr. Eller, a strong-willed 60-year-old who keeps tight control over the company. Last summer, he recalls, he asked his senior vice president of human resources, Charles Shoumaker, to consider &quot;all the different angles&quot; for cutting medical costs, which are handled by the company itself rather than through an insurer.    &quot;I had heard that some company had decided not to cover some of these things,&quot; Mr. Eller says, adding that he is unsure about the source of the information or which groups -- AIDS patients or those with alcohol and drug problems -- were affected.    The changes bearing on life style were &quot;only one of a series of seven or eight steps&quot; in the cost-cutting plan that resulted, Mr. Shoumaker says. For example, Circle K also added restrictions on elective surgery and doubled to six months the waiting period new employees face before they become eligible for coverage.    But Mr. Shoumaker says Circle K's health-insurance statistics added an imperative to the problem of AIDS-related costs. He found that last year the company paid about $500,000, or nearly 4% of its healthcare budget, for treatment of nine AIDS patients. Other employers spend 1% to 2% of their budgets for AIDS, he says.    A major reason for the discrepancy, Mr. Shoumaker explains, is that Phoenix-based Circle K, with about 26,000 employees, has an annual turnover rate of 170%. &quot;That means we have a higher chance of hiring someone with AIDS,&quot; he says. Moreover, Circle K employs many people who have never had medical insurance or have had only minimal coverage. Some job applicants, he contends, &quot;are shopping us for insurance coverage.&quot;    The new health-care policy underwent a thorough review. &quot;I had some questions in my own mind as to how far we could impose limitations,&quot; Mr. Shoumaker says.    Circle K executives say they expected complaints internally about the plan, and from the gay community about the AIDS provision, but add that they foresaw it as scattered and short-lived. Mr. Shoumaker, a nonpracticing lawyer, says his bigger concern was over the legality of excluding certain categories of coverage. After some research of his own, he asked a large Phoenix law firm familiar with labor and federal benefits law to review the changes. &quot;They said we could go ahead,&quot; he says.    Despite their confidence about the legality of the move, Circle K's attorneys expected there might be legal challenges from the work force, which is nonunion. A letter explaining the policy was sent to employees at the end of last year, and Mr. Cox was put in charge of dealing with the responses. Two years earlier, he had skillfully handled a media barrage that arose when Circle K came under fire from antipornography groups for refusing to remove Playboy, Penthouse and other adult magazines from its stores' shelves.    As Circle K executives braced for an employee response to the letter, their first surprise was the lack of any immediate reaction at all. Although the changes became effective on Jan. 1, questions didn't begin trickling in until the spring, when the company received a phone call from a Florida AIDS group, which followed up in early July with a letter.    The lack of response lulled management and made them wonder whether they had been overly cautious. But when the press finally did get hold of the story, things happened fast.    On Aug. 3, Mr. Cox got a call from an Arizona Republic reporter who had been tipped about the issue by a local AIDS group. Mr. Cox says he immediately telephoned Mr. Eller to warn that &quot;we're going to get a firestorm.&quot; When Mr. Cox arrived at his office the next day at 6:45 a.m., the phones were already ringing.    On Aug. 5, this newspaper carried the story on its inside pages; on Aug. 6, the New York Times featured it on its front page. Over the next few days, Mr. Cox appeared on scores of radio and TV shows.    The cacophony peaked on Aug. 10. At 3:30 a.m., Mr. Cox accompanied the media-shy Mr. Eller to the local NBC-TV affiliate for a &quot;Today&quot; show taping. Bryant Gumbel, the show's host, asked Mr. Eller a question uppermost in the minds of many critics: &quot;What is it you're trying to police here -- is it health or morality?&quot; The rambling answer from Mr. Eller, who was visibly uncomfortable, stressed the company's need to contain rising medical costs.    Later that morning, Mr. Cox met with Mr. Buck, the activist, who voiced his objections about singling out AIDS patients and argued that the plan would be unworkable. For example, Mr. Buck says, if an employee were hurt in a bathtub fall, the plan would enable the company to claim intoxication and refuse coverage.    At the end of the day, Mr. Eller met with Mr. Cox, Mr. Shoumaker, Circle K President Robert Reade and Gehl Babinec, senior vice president and general counsel. The group hammered out a press release, issued the next morning, announcing the suspension of the new plan. The company conceded that it needed to clarify the measures and how they would be implemented. &quot;There were too many unenforceable aspects, so we decided to push the pause button,&quot; says Mr. Cox, who acknowledges that Mr. Buck's comments played a role in the decision.    In retrospect, Circle K executives say they believe the letter to employees was poorly executed. Prepared for mailing between Christmas and New Year's Eve, it wasn't reviewed by certain vacationing executives who, the company says, might have toned down references to &quot;personal life-style decisions.&quot;    Mr. Cox says the letter seemed even more inflammatory because of things it left unexplained. The letter failed to note, for example, that the policy change would affect only new hires and not the 8,000 employees covered under the current plan. It also didn't explain that only accidents -- and not illnesses -- caused by alcohol or drug abuse would be excluded.    While the suspension of the plan initially appeared to take some of the heat off, there have been signs this week that Mr. Buck and others won't be satisfied with anything less than full retreat.    &quot;It looks like we've taken a step backward,&quot; says Mr. Buck, charging that Mr. Eller backed out of a scheduled meeting with him. Mr. Buck had said earlier he was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; the meeting would bring an end to the plan, and had been asking gay- and civil-rights groups to hold off on threatened boycotts of Circle K stores pending the company's next move.    &quot;I had another meeting I was tied up with,&quot; Mr. Eller explains. However, he adds, &quot;we've suspended the (new plan), and I would imagine we'll keep it suspended or figure some other way to accomplish cost control.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
