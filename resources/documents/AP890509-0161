Bush chatted for three minutes with Capt. David M. Walker andhis four crew members, asking them about the accomplishments oftheir mission and promising to do the best he could in the federalbudget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.   In what has come to be known as Bushspeak, the president queriedthe astronauts about their deployment of a planetary probe forVenus, asking: ``Look, how was the actual deployment thing. Thatwent smoothly as I recall.''   He told the crew to visit him at the White House when theyreturn from their mission and see his dog Millie's new puppies.   ``Unless you hurry up, the puppies are gone,'' he said. TheBushes are giving the puppies away to family members.   Atlantis' mission ended Monday when the 97-ton shuttle landed atEdwards Air Force Base, Calif. after deploying Magellan, thenation's first planetary probe in 11 years and the first ever toride a shuttle into space.   ``I want you to come here, and it _ we're very proud of the jobyou all did,'' Bush said.   He added that, ``My only worries _ and they are worries thataffect absolutely everything that I want to do _ is budgetaryconstraints. But we've got some, I think, reasonably good figuresin here now for NASA ... so we'll try to do our part from thisend.''</TEXT></DOC>
