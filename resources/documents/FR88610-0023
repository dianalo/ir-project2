The proposed changes include revised requirements for anapplication for a new license, a process for pre-filing consultation withresource agencies, and new standards and factors for evaluating relicensingapplication. The proposed rule also revises the procedures for an applicationfor a nonpower license, a minor license, and an exemption from licensingupon expiration of an existing license. The Commission proposes new provisionsrelating to acceleration of a license expiration date and site access forpotential competing applicants.
