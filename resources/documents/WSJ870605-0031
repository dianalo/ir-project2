Col. Oliver North to testify under a grant of immunity, as investigators revealed new evidence regarding profit-taking in the Iran-Contra affair and a surreptitious plan to channel money to the former White House aide.    Meanwhile, it was disclosed that funds raised by the private-arms operation were used to pay for such personal expenditures as a sports car, a small plane, and a stay at a weight-watchers spa. Lawmakers also heard testimony that the network committed itself to make payments to influential officials and businessmen in Iran.    The central figure in the Iran-Contra affair, Col. North has repeatedly invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and refused to testify before Congress or comply with subpoenas by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. The committees' vote to grant him limited immunity was designed to break this impasse.    The committees' attorneys hope to begin their examination of Col. North after June 15. A vote on having the former aide testify publicly should come later, but Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the House panel, said Col. North won't appear publicly before mid-July.    That schedule was designed in part to meet demands by Mr. Walsh. After immunity is granted, the prosecutor wouldn't be able to use Col. North's public testimony as evidence against him in any criminal proceeding. But the prosecutor could use information he derives independently of the committees' proceedings, so long as he could demonstrate he obtained it by other means.    Mr. Walsh had asked the lawmakers to refrain completely from granting Col. North immunity. But the independent counsel said the panels' decision to delay his public testimony &quot;goes a long way&quot; toward alleviating his earlier concerns.    Moreover, because Col. North's testimony would come after the committees have collected information from a number of other main figures in the Iran-Contra affair, &quot;there is a significant chance&quot; that the committees &quot;will be able to limit&quot; the former aide's testimony in order to minimize the likely impact on any future prosecutions, Mr. Walsh said.    Yesterday, the investigating committees received testimony that appeared to confirm that Col. North's wife, Betsy, met last September with a Geneva attorney who represented businessmen Albert Hakim, the financial manager of the Iran-Contra operation.    Mr. Hakim said he had instructed the attorney, Willard Zucker, to contact Mrs. North to discuss a plan to make an anonymous gift to pay for the North children's educational expenses. But Senate counsel Arthur Liman said it was &quot;preposterous&quot; to assume that Col. North wasn't aware of the meeting and Mr. Hakim's tie to Mr. Zucker. Under cross-examination, Mr. Hakim acknowledged that he thought it was &quot;impossible&quot; that the former aide wouldn't learn eventually the source of the money. However, he testified that Col. North never commented to him about the proposal.    Also yesterday, David Lewis, a Washington attorney, testified that he discussed a plan with Mr. Zucker to make a payment to Col. North's wife under the guise of a real estate transaction. &quot;He was essentially looking for a cover for someone to merely pay money to a certain person here in the U.S.,&quot; said Mr. Lewis. &quot;He said the person was the wife of someone in the White House, that the. . .money was earned by the person in the White House in some unrelated matter. . .To the best of my recollection he said it was Lt. Col. Oliver North.&quot;    Mr. Lewis told lawmakers he talked with Mr. Zucker in late September -- around the time the lawyer met with Mrs. North -- and again on Oct. 10. That suggests the real estate scheme was still being considered after the discussions with Col. North's wife. Efforts to reach Col. North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, were unsuccessful.    The committees haven't found any evidence that the money ever was transferred, but Mr. Hakim has said he set aside $200,000 from the proceeds of U.S. arms sales to Iran to assist Col. North's family.    Mr. Hakim said he informed his partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, of his intention to help Col. North financially. He said that while he and his partner had some disagreement about the sum involved, Gen. Secord acquiesced in the arrangement. &quot;By not disagreeing, he agreed,&quot; said Mr. Hakim.    Gen. Secord has insisted he renounced any share in the profits from the Iran-Contra enterprise. But Sen. Paul Trible (R., Va.) said investigators have found evidence that the general withdrew more than $80,000 of the money to pay for a small plane, a Porsche sports car, and a visit to a weight-reduction camp with former Central Intelligence Agency officer Thomas Clines. Mr. Clines served as an arms dealer in Europe and received an estimated $990,003 under a secret account established on his behalf by Mr. Hakim.    Mr. Hakim also described for the lawmakers how he opened a new channel of communications between U.S. officials and Iran in late 1986. He said that it was his impression that Col. North was under &quot;political pressure&quot; to get all of the American hostages out of Lebanon before the U.S. congressional elections in November. He said Col. North &quot;wanted to enhance the position of the president,&quot; but that he urged the former White House aide to concentrate more on long-range relations with Iran.    Mr. Hakim said his efforts led to meetings in Washington between participants in the arms network and Iranian officials and businessmen. Some of the meetings were held in Col. North's office near the White House. Mr. Hakim didn't identify the Iranian participants, but he said the Americans included Col. North, Gen. Secord and George Cave, a CIA consultant.    Mr. Hakim testified that he and the Iranians wanted to be paid for opening the new channel, and he said that Gen. Secord, Col. North and Mr. Cave agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to the idea. He said that he had set aside $2 million in profits from the Iran-Contra operations to cover any payments. He said he still regards some of the funds, which are under his control in London, as being obligated to the Iranians. </TEXT></DOC>
