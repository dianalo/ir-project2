Special emphasis will be placed on substantive technical issues.The scope includes a broad range of regulatory issues, identification andbounding of the significant technical issues bearing on safety, the needfor standards, and the appropriate role and scope of deterministic andprobabilistic risk assessments in the safety evaluations involved. Viewson the schedule for the rulemaking and alternatives for addressing NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA) issues are also included. The workshopwill not deal with the numerous procedural issues which are central tothe specification of a license renewal rule. Public comments have beensolicited previously on two occasions. A solicitation for comments on sevenmajor procedural and technical issues was published on November 6, 1986,``Request for Comments on Development of Policy for Nuclear Power PlantLicense Renewal,'' (51 FR, Vol. 51, pages 40334-40335). On August 29, 1988,an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking was published (53 FR, Vol. 53,pages 32919-32920). This notice solicited comments on NUREG-1317, ``RegulatoryOptions for Nuclear Plant License Renewal,'' August 1988. Comments on thefull range of procedural as well as technical and policy issues will besolicited again when a proposed license renewal rule is published aboutlate May 1990.The following material includes a tentative workshop agenda, discussionof how the workshop will be organized and conducted, and information onissues and questions that will be covered in the workshop. Following thediscussion of the workshop organization and conduct, a discussion is providedof the staff's preliminary regulatory philosophy and guiding principlesfor developing a proposed rule on license renewal. This discussion is followedby an outline of a conceptual approach to a license renewal rule, whichillustrates how a rule embodying these principles might be structured.The primary technical focus of the workshop will be on sections XX.9, XX.19and XX.25 of the rule outline. More detailed information on each sessionwill be available after October 31, 1989. This information will be mailedto all individuals and organizations who notify NRC of their intent toattend and to others who request it.

The scope of issuesto be covered by the workshop is broadly defined in the subsequent sections,``Preliminary Regulatory Philosophy and Approach for License Renewal Regulation''and ``Outline of a Conceptual Approach to a License Renewal Rule.'' Discussionof the substantive technical requirements will be guided by sections XX.9Content of Application_Technical Information, XX.19 Standards for Issuanceof Renewal License, and XX.25 Additional Records and Recordkeeping Requirementsin the outline of a conceptual approach.The opening presentation on the staff preliminary regulatory philosophyand approach for license renewal is intended to provide an overview ofthe regulatory philosophy that the staff proposes as a basis for developingpolicy, technical, and legal positions regarding a license renewal rule.No comments will be taken at this point in the program. Opportunity forcomment on issues raised in the opening presentation will be availableas the issues are discussed in Sessions 1 and 5.In Session 1 the staff will systematically review the spectrum of policyand technical issues that must be dealt with in developing a rule and regulatoryguidance. The session will result in a common framework of informationand understanding to be taken into the remainder of the sessions. Alsothe range of attendee views on various issues will begin to emerge throughtheir comments. Areas to be covered include overall approach to formulatinga rule, licensing basis for renewal, screening methodology, content ofapplication, trending and recordkeeping, and National Environmental PolicyAct (NEPA) requirements.In Session 1 the staff will review and explain the requirements proposedin the outline and current thining on the scope and content of regulatoryguides. The staff is considering two key regulatory guides to accompanythe rulemaking.1. Guidance for Developing Technical Information for Nuclear Power PlantOperating License Renewal Applications. The scope of this guide will include:andbullet; Methodology for selection of systems, structures, and componentsandbullet; Identification of stressors and environmentandbullet; Identification of degradation sites at the installed locationandbullet; Aging mechanismsandbullet; Tracking and recordkeepingandbullet; Maintenance, refurbishment, replacement2. Screening and Selection of Important-to-Safety Systems, Structures,and Components. The scope of this guide will include:andbullet; Deterministic approachandbullet; Probabilistic risk methodandbullet; Hybrid approach involving deterministic and probabilistic methodsTwo additional topics also have been identified for potential regulatoryguides useful for implementing the rule.1. Recordkeeping and Trending2. Methods and Criteria for Fatigue AnalysisThe following set of general questions are offered to aid in moving discussionfrom the general requirements stated in the outline to a more detailedevaluation of the technical issues that must be resolved in order to developthe concrete regulatory language of a proposed rule and draft regulatoryguides.andbullet; To what extent is it clear how each individual requirement insections XX.9, XX.19, and XX.25 might be fulfilled?andbullet; To what extent might there be a redundancy with existing regulations?andbullet; What are problems and uncertainties in fulfilling each requirement?andbullet; To what extent can these problems and uncertainties be dealt within a rule?andbullet; To what extent should these problems and uncertainties be dealtwith in staff guidance documents? What guidance documents should be developed?andbullet; To what extent should the license renewal process rely upon probabilisticrisk assessment (PRA) insights, and what value might be associated withthe conduct of a Level 3 PRA?In Sessions 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 the issues developed in Session 1 will beexamined by applying these questions to four system, structure, and componentgroupings and to the screening of systems, structures, and components importantto safety. In Session 5 the policy issues identified in Session 1 willbe examined in greater depth.Session 7 on environmental effects will explore the scheduling and meritsof preparing a generic environmental assessment or impact statement, thefindings of which could be codified in 10 CFR part 51. This would genericallyconsider and bound to the extent possible the environmental effects oflicense renewal, thereby limiting the scope of effects that need to beevaluated in individual license renewal actions. Issues to be addressedinclude:andbullet; Sources of initiators of environmental effectsandbullet; Scope and magnitude of potential effectsandbullet; Scope of severe accident analysesandbullet; Spent fuel storage considerationsandbullet; Alternative sources of energy, scope of treatmentandbullet; Experimental knowledge, environmental studies, analyses and datasourcesandbullet; Potential effectiveness of a generic environmental impact statementin bounding future plant-specific environmental impact statementsAt each session the staff will first make a presentation; then commentswill be taken from parties in the order in which they notified the staffof their intent to comment in a specific session. The order for commentwill be:1. Parties who notified the staff by November 1, 19892. Parties registering to comment prior to 8:30 a.m. the day of the session3. Parties who have not given prior noticeComments will be limited to 15 minutes for those representing organizationsand 5 minutes for individuals. These limits may be adjusted up or downbased on the number of commenters. A transcript will be made of the completeworkshop.<ITAG tagnum="85">Preliminary Regulatory Philosophy and Approach for License RenewalRegulation</ITAG>The following discussion presents a general overview of the regulatoryphilosophy which the staff proposes be used in developing the policy, technical,and legal positions regarding a license renewal rule.The regulatory policy that the staff proposes for license renewal is foundedon two key principles. The first principle is that the ``current licensingbasis'' at a specific reactor provides and maintains a level of safetyfor operation during the initial term that is sufficient to provide adequateassurance of the public health and safety and common defense and security,and that the same level of safety is also adequate for continued operationduring any renewal period. The second and equally important principle isthat any license renewal policy must provide assurance that the level ofsafety provided by a nuclear power plant's current licensing basis willnot degrade during the renewal period.The first principle is founded on the Commission's initial finding of adequateprotection for the initial design and construction of a nuclear power plant,as well as the Commission's continuing oversight and regulatory actionswith respect to nuclear power plants. The Commission may issue an operatinglicense to a utility only if it can make the findings required by 10 CFR50.57. More specifically, the Commission must conclude that the facilitywill operate in compliance with the application as amended and the rulesand regulations of the Commission. Further, the Commission must concludethat the authorized activities can be conducted without endangering thehealth and safety of the public and that the issuance of an operating licensewill not be inimical to the common defense and security or the public healthand safety. Thus, when the Commission issues an initial operating license,it has determined that the design, construction, and proposed operationof the facility satisfies all of the Commission's requirements and providesadequate protection of the public health and safety and common defenseand security.However, the licensing basis upon which the Commission found adequate protectiondoes not remain fixed for the term of the operating license. Rather, thelicensing basis continues to evolve and expand during the term of operation,in part because of the continuing regulatory activities of the Commission.These include research, inspections, and the identification and resolutionof potential safety concerns. New regulations are promulgated by the Commissionthat may require plant modifications on a plant-specific basis; genericand unresolved safety issues are resolved that may recommend that licensesevaluate and modify their designs; and additional evaluations are routinelyrequired as the Commission identifies areas of plant operation that requireadditional understanding. Thus, the Commission-required changes to a plant'slicensing basis provides ongoing assurance that the original Commissionconclusion of adequate protection of the health and safety and common defenseand security continue to remain valid throughout the remaining term ofthe facility's operating license.The second principle follows from the first: if the current licensing basisprovides adequate assurance to public health and safety and common defenseand security, then licensees must continue to comply with the current licensingbasis as it evolves in order for the Commission to have continued assuranceof adequate protection. The staff believes that assurance of such complianceinto the renewed period of operation rests on two factors: licensee programsfor ensuring continued safe operation of the plant, and the Commission'sregulatory oversight programs. The licensee programs include self-inspection,maintenance, and surveillance programs that monitor and test the physicalcondition of plant equipment as the plant operates. Through these programs,licensees identify the degradation of components to a number of differentenvironmental stressors and are, in general, able to replace or refurbishtheir equipment so that the necessary safety features would work when actuallycalled upon under transient or accident conditions.The Commission employs an oversight role in ensuring that the licenseesprograms are effective through its inspection program. The NRC inspectionprogram historically has been constructed around a series of inspectionprocedures that provide for the routine examination of activities at anoperating nuclear facility on a recurring schedule. The NRC inspectionprogram employs a balanced look at a cross section of plant activitiesconsidered important to maintaining safety. It has the specific purposeof obtaining sufficient information on licensee perfomance, through directobservation and verification of licensee activities, to determine whetherthe facility is being operated safely; whether the licensee managementcontrol program is effective; and whether the regulatory requirements arebeing met. The program includes inspection of the licensee's performancein functional technical disciplines such as operations, radiological controls,maintenance, surveillance, environmental protection, physical security,and engineering. It is important to note, however, that implementationof the Commission inspection program does not supplant the licensee's programsor responsibilities. Rather, it provides a feedback mechanism and an independentverification of the effectiveness of the licensee's implementation of itsprograms to ensure that operations are being conducted safely and in accordancewith applicable NRC requirements.The staff is currently developing an approach for license renewal thatembodies the principles outlined above. It is the staff's intention thatthe license renewal rule and accompanying regulatory materials will clearlydefine the safety requirements that the licensee must address in orderfor the Commission to approve the licensee's renewal application. The staff'scurrent effort is focusing on two areas: (1) The definition of and regulatoryrequirements relative to the ``current licensing basis,'' and (2) definingthe technical requirements necessary to ensure continued assurance of adequateprotection during the renewed term of operation, with emphasis on degradationand aging.With regard to the ``current licensing basis,'' the staff intends to proposethat the license renewal rule require the renewal application to containa summary of all regulatory requirements and commitments so that the ``currentlicensing basis'' for the plant will be clearly understood and locatedin one document_the renewal application (which would be updated to thedate of issuance of the renewal license). The staff is presently workingto define the term, ``current licensing basis.'' As currently being developedby the staff, it would include all the information and commitments containedin the current FSAR, as well as other docketed correspondence.With respect to degradation and aging in the renewed term of operation,the staff is working to determine what licensee actions are required toprovide assurance that systems, structures, and components important tocontinued safe plant operation will not be degraded by aging mechanismssuch as fatigue, erosion, thermal or radiation-induced embrittlement, corrosion,service wear, and chemical effects. Those structures, systems, and componentsthat are effectively covered by existing ongoing NRC requirements and/orlicensee programs, or are not subject to aging mechanisms need not be addressedin the application (and need not be within the scope of the hearing process).While not completely developed at the moment, the scope of structures,systems and components (SSCs) to be addressed will probably be similarto that identified in the rulemaking for environmental qualification ofelectrical equipment. Licensees would then be required to identify wherein existing plant programs, the degradation mechanisms are being monitoredto provide reasonable assurance that replacement or refurbishment schedulesfor degrading equipment are being developed or service lifetime for equipmentestablished. The staff is also considering whether additional recordkeepingrequirements should be developed that would require retention of documentationregarding the design and environmental conditions for which the equipmentmust function, and the degradation mechanisms that might exist at the installedequipment location. A trending system of performance and key parametersmay also be required to be instituted.The staff is considering requirements related to severe accidents thatmust be satisfied as a precondition to submission of a renewal application.In summary, the staff would propose that a renewal applicant have completedboth the IPE and Accident Management programs. Further, the renewal applicantshould have completed or have scheduled all planned plant modificationsthat were identified through these severe accident programs. The focusof this requirement would be to ensure that closure of the severe accidentissues have been reached for the plant under its initial license priorto applying for the renewed license.The staff intends to propose that the renewal decision depend on whetherthe facility provides adequate protection to the public health and safetyand common defense and security, based upon the following factors: (1)Whether the current licensing basis has been accurately described, (2)whether the licensee has described an adequate program to address degradationor aging of SSCs that are important to safety, and (3) whether severe accidentissues have been adequately addressed and resolved. Certain issues wouldnot have to be addressed in the renewal application, although the descriptionof ``current licensing basis'' for the facility would include the regulatoryrequirements and licensee commitments with respect to these issues, forpurposes of having a legal basis for enforcement action during the renewedterm. Issues likely to be excluded from the scope of the renewal decisioninclude staffing, training program, organizational structure, operationQA program, health physics/ALARA programs, security program, procedures,structures, systems, and components covered under the inservice inspection(ISI) and inservice testing (IST) programs, containment testing and periodicsurveillances specified in the technical specifications, emergency planningand EQ matters addressed by andSection; 50.49, as well as others. Any lackof compliance by a licensee with these requirements is more appropriatelythe subject of a andSection; 2.206 petition, and the circumstance of a renewalapplication should not provide a forum for assessing compliance with requirementsthat do not form the basis for the Commission's renewal decision. The licenserenewal rule, together with the recent changes to Part 2, will providea framework for focusing any necessary hearings on the safety issues relevantto the license renewal decision.The staff intends to propose that no application for renewal will be acceptedmore than 20 years before the expiration of the current operating license.In addition, it would propose that the renewal term of a renewed licensebe limited to the balance of years remaining on the license currently ineffect plus no more than an additional 20 years. The staff has not identifieda firm technical concern that would justify this limitation; however, thestaff wishes to proceed cautiously when projecting the remaining usefullife of present reactors.The staff believes that the timely renewal provision of 10 CFR 2.109 mustbe revised. Various estimates have been made concerning what is a reasonabletime period for the review of a renewal application. Estimates by boththe Commission and the industry suggest that a 2-to-3-year period (includinghearings) may be necessary to approve a renewal of an operating license.Provided that a sufficient application is made in accordance with the timelyrenewal provisions of the revised andSection; 2.109, plant operation underthe provisions of the prexisting license may continue while the renewalapplication is under review. Recognizing that there is not a strong basisfor selecting a particular cutoff time, the staff intends to propose thata sufficient application for renewal of an operating license should bereceived no later than 3 years prior to the expiration of the operatinglicense in effect for the timely renewal provision to apply.The staff will propose that the renewal license be a type of license thatwould become effective immediately and would void the license previouslyin effect. This license, termed a ``supersession license,'' would removeany ambiguity that would otherwise exist concerning the conditions underwhich a licensee would operate a plant during any period that may overlapthe issuance of the renewal license and the term of the pre-existing license.Under andSection;andSection; 50.54(bb) and 50.75, licensees are required tosubmit a funding plan for disposal of irradiated fuel and a funding planfor decommissioning. One year before the operating license is to expire,licensees are required by andSection; 50.82 to file an application for terminationof the operating license together with a decommissioning plan. The staffis considering exempting plants that have submitted acceptable renewalapplications from these requirements while the applications are under staffreview, but in no case more than 1 year after the expiration of the originaloperating license. If submission of the materials required by andSection;andSection;50.75(f), 50.54(bb), and 50.82 has been postponed and the license shouldwithdraw its renewal application, or if the application is denied, thestaff believes that the licensee should provide the necessary plans nomore than 6 months later.With regard to compliance with the requirements of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA), the staff has determined that an environmental assessmentis required at minimum to support the license renewal rulemaking. Apartfrom this task, the staff is considering two changes to the current regulations.First, the staff is evaluating whether the requirement in 10 CFR 51.20(b)(2)that an EIS be prepared for every license renewal application should bemodified to allow the NRC the option of preparing an environmental assessmentfor the prupose of determining whether an EIS should be prepared. Second,the staff is considering whether either a generic assessment or a genericenvironmental impact statement (GEIS) should be prepared to describe andevaluate, on a generic basis, any environmental impacts that are commonto, or may be enveloped by, all (or a significant number of) nuclear powerplants. It is the staff's intention that if such a generic evaluation isprepared, its substantive findings would be adopted as a rule. The findingsso codified could not be challenged in any individual license renewal proceedingunless an intervenor could show, on the basis of new information, thatthe evaluation and conclusions set forth in the rule were incorrect forthe particular facility.The staff does not intend to revise part 51's requirement that a renewalapplicant submit a supplement to the existing environmental report preparedin connection with the initial licensing. Some clarifying changes in part51 may be necessary to make clear that the supplemental environment report(ER) in support of a license renewal application should address those changesthat have occurred since the initial licensing. In addition, if the Commissiondetermines that a generic assessment or generic statement should be prepared,part 51 would be amended to specify that the ER provide a comparison ofthe plant-specific site parameters to those used in the generic documentto identify environmental issues outside the scope of the generic evaluation.It would be necessary to compare the existing plant data with those usedgenerically to ensure that the plant conditions were bounded by the genericevaluation.The staff intends to propose a change to the Backfit Rule, 10 CFR 50.109,to specifically designate the issuance of a renewal license as an eventafter which the requirements of the Backfit Rule would apply. As presentlywritten, the Backfit Rule does not specifically refer to renewed licenses.The proposed change would remove any ambiguity in this regard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Outline of a Conceptual Approach to a License Renewal Rule</ITAG>XX.1 Purpose and ScopeThis subpart governs the issuance of renewed operating licenses for nuclearpower facilities licensed pursuant to sections 103 or 104b of the AtomicEnergy Act of 1954, as amended (68 Stat. 919), and title II of the EnergyReorganization Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 1242).XX.3 DefinitionsAs used in this part,(a) ``Current licensing basis'' means the original licensing basis as describedin the licensee's Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) at the time the initiallicense was granted plus those additional requirements that have been imposedand those commitments that have been made by the licensee during the periodof plant operation up to the time of application for license renewal.
