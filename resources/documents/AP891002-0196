But plans to settle new immigrants in the Israeli-occupiedterritories may jeopardize support from Washington, which viewsJewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an obstacleto Middle East peace efforts.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday the Bushadministration would reject any request for aid to resettleimmigrants in the occupied lands.   The West Bank and Gaza are home to 1.7 million Palestinians and70,000 Jewish settlers. They are the scene of a 21-month-oldPalestinian uprising against Israeli rule.   Israeli officials say more Soviet Jews will flock to the Jewishstate as a result of new U.S. immigration restrictions that make itmore difficult to go to the United States and because of worseningeconomic conditions in their homeland.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's special adviser on Jewishaffairs, Yitzhak David, said one barometer of the interest inemigration is the number of sponsorship offers sent to Israel'sdiplomatic mission in Moscow at the behest of would-be emigrants.   He said an average of 200 such invitations, needed to startemigration procedures, are received daily. About 200,000 SovietJews have requested sponsorship so far this year.   Washington has set a ceiling of 50,000 Soviets to be admitted asrefugees next year. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 may enter thecountry on a so-called parole basis with no government support.   ``We do anticipate growing numbers of Jewish immigrants wantingto settle in Israel,'' Fitzwater said. ``There may be costsassociated with that.''   Simcha Dinitz, head of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency,which helps settle new arrivals, said 100,000 Soviets are expectedover the next three to five years. David said the number couldreach 150,000.   Israel estimates resettlement costs at $3 billion over three tofive years and hopes to get $600 million in donations from U.S.Jewish groups.   It also wants $400 million in U.S-government guaranteed loansthat would allow it to borrow money from commercial banks at lowinterest, Finance Ministry Spokesman Arieh Greenblatt said.   The funding request was made by Finance Minister Shimon Peres,who raised the issue with President Bush last week in New York, hesaid.   Fitzwater said Bush ``emphasized his symphathy for that problemand committed to look into it'' but details were not discussed.   The current American program of financing housing projectslimits loan guarantees to $25 million per country a year.   Officials in Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc say Soviet Jewsshould be settled in the occupied territories, which Likud sees asan integral part of Israel.   Housing Minister David Levy drew sharp criticism from Americanofficials and Jewish leaders when he first voiced the idea lastJune. Liberal critics said it would deter Soviet Jews who do notwant to be thrust into the midst of the Palestinian uprising.   Dinitz said the Jewish Agency would not allow its funds to beused in the occupied territories.   ``The Jewish Agency, the main body raising funds abroad, isobliged by its policy to use all the funds for absorption in Israelproper,'' he said. ``Whatever the government decides, it'sgovernment's business, but Jewish Agency funds will be used only inIsrael.''   David, the Shamir adviser, said Israel would settle Jews in theWest Bank and Gaza with or without U.S. backing.   ``We are a sovereign state, and we think this immigration waveshould be directed there. If the Americans refuse to give money, weshall take a loan from our own population, but we won't stop.''   David said a group of settlement leaders was discussing the ideawith Shamir and that he was working on a survey of housing and jobopportunities in the West Bank and Gaza.   Another controversial proposal by Israel's Absorption MinisterYizthak Peretz calls for directing the majority of new immigrantsto development towns in remote areas of Israel.   Jewish activists in Moscow say many Jews who seek to go to theUnited States would rather stay in the Soviet Union than go toIsrael.   Some 250,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel between 1967 and1988.   Last year, 2,173 out of 18,961 Soviet Jewish emigrants came toIsrael, according to the Jerusalem-based Soviet Jewry Education andInformation Center. In January-August this year, 4,175 of the34,610 Soviet Jewish emigrants came to Israel, and the governmentexpects a total of 7,000 in 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
