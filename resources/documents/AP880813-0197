The gathering was held near the border of Serbia's autonomousprovince of Vojvodina. Milosevic recently accused Vojvodina'sleaders of hampering efforts to amend the Serbian constitution togive Serbia greater control over its two autonomous provinces.   Vojvodina and the troubled southern province of Kosovo, thoughformally parts of Serbia, were given broad administrative autonomyunder the 1974 constitution adopted while the late Josip Broz Titowas president.   Serbia's leaders want to reduce that autonomy in hopes ofcurtailing ethnic strife in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanianmajority is said to be terrorizing the Serbian minority and forcinga Serbian exodus from the province.   ``We don't want divisions!,'' ``A unified Serbia!,'' ``We don'tgive them Kosovo!,'' chanted the demonstrators, many of whom turnedout in traditional Serbian national dress.   It was the third such demonstration in the area since July 9.All of them were widely believed to have been orchestrated byMilosevic himself in an effort to demonstrate popular support forhis policies.   Nova Pazova, a farming community, lies less than 15 miles westof Belgrade in Yugoslavia's breadbasket region.   Earlier demonstrations led to public accusations by theVojvodina Communist leadership that Milosevic was using unethicalpressure tactics to achieve his goal of a unified Serbia.   Speaker after speaker at Friday's meeting assailed theleadership in both Vojvodina and Kosovo, calling the leaders``cheap opportunists'' who were unwilling to sacrifice personalprivilege for unity of the republic.</TEXT></DOC>
