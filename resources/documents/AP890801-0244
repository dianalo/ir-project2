Committee Chairman Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said heexpected the full Senate to vote on the nominations of Alfred C.Sikes, Sherrie P. Marshall and Andrew C. Barrett before thescheduled beginning of the congressional recess on Friday.   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.,cast the dissenting votes.   The vote came one day after a hearing that was dominated by theissues of sex and violence on the airwaves.   Gore said he voted against the nomination as a symbolic protestof eight years of free-market deregulation of the communicationsindustry under the Reagan administration. He said he believed thenew nominees would continue the Reagan-era philosophy.   Hollings, Gore and others hit hard on TV indecency, noting thatuntil Congress stepped in to ban all indecent TV programs in 1988,the FCC had established a ``safe harbor'' for such shows frommidnight to 6 a.m. when children were presumed not to be watching.   ``Garbage is garbage regardless of the time of day,'' Hollingssaid.   Barrett sparked a confrontation with Gore when he said that heabhorred indecent programming, but that the FCC must recognize``there is a market for indecency'' and that the agency's role isto decide ``what the law will allow us to tolerate.''   Americans, Gore responded, are ``sick and tired of what's goingon.''   Sikes said he would vigorously attack obscene material on theairwaves, but that the Supreme Court has proscribed much ofCongress' power in the area of free speech and indecency.   The FCC last year tried to implement the 24-hour ban on indecentprogramming, but broadcasters and civil rights groups challenged iton constitutional grounds. A federal appeals court in Januarystayed imposition of the law.   Hollings and other committee members expressed hope thatrelations between the FCC and Congress would improve after eightyears of battles with a commission headed by outgoing ChairmanDennis R. Patrick and his predecessor, Mark S. Fowler.   Because of his displeasure with Patrick's policies, Hollings hadrefused for more than a year to hold hearings on other nominees tofill two vacancies on the five-member FCC. Patrick will step downwhen Sikes is confirmed.   Sikes, a self-described moderate, is the assistant secretary ofCommerce for communications and information, a former broadcasterand a longtime political ally of Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., amember of the committee.   Barrett is a member of the Illinois Commerce Commission, andMarshall is a lawyer and former legislative aide to Patrick.   The nominees face a host of important issues, such as thegovernment role in fostering international competitiveness in areassuch as high-definition television; further deregulation of thetelephone industry; re-regulating cable television; and assignmentof the airwaves to competing businesses such as cellular telephonesand direct broadcast satellites.</TEXT></DOC>
