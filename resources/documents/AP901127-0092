Radio stations played sad songs, and Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled,commander of the sector where the deaths occurred, said: ``Today wepaid in a big way, heavily.''   The shock over the latest deaths was compounded by the fact thatonly two days earlier, four Israelis were shot and killed by aninfiltrator on the Egyptian border.   In a commentary in the daily Maariv, Shmuel Schnitzer wrote:``We have to learn to live with the feeling that death lurkseverywhere.''   The border violence also includes two army deaths on the JordanRiver this month. ``I don't recall a month where we have paid sucha price,'' said an army officer, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   In fact, the army has suffered much higher casualties duringIsrael's 42 years of statehood. But the latest deaths caught theIsraeli public off guard - preoccupied by the 3-year-oldPalestinian uprising in the occupied territories and the influx ofSoviet Jews.   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet was inspecial session to debate the $37.5 billion state budget for 1991.At issue was how to cover the costs of absorbing hundreds ofthousands of immigrants while maintaining a strong militaryposture. No decision was reached.   The army also faces a struggle to retain public confidence. Ithas been wracked for months by a bitter race for the post of chiefof staff. And in the midst of the news of the deaths in Lebanon, itemerged that a senior general had resigned in anger, complainingthat the army was ill-prepared for war.   As head of training and planning, Maj. Gen. Moshe Bar-Kochba wasin charge of studying the lessons of past military setbacks. In aletter broadcast by Israel radio, he claimed no one was payingattention to his findings.   All this, plus the undercurrent of worry that the Persian Gulfcrisis could drag Israel into war, has created an atmosphere offoreboding.   Bar-Kochba's letter ``came at a very bad moment,'' armyspokesman Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai told Israel television. ``I don'tthink he intended it to be this way but that's how it came out.''   At the hospital where his 20-year-old son Haim was recoveringfrom injuries suffered in the Lebanon clash, Pinchas Cohen, 50,told reporters:   ``It's too bad that our generation didn't solve our securityproblems for our children, who are now fated to sacrifice theirlives.   ``But we don't have much choice and we cannot allow this tobreak us.''   Cohen was the only Israeli wounded in the clash, which occurredduring the night but was not announced to Israelis until latemorning after the families of the dead had been notified.   Those buried Tuesday were Staff Sgt. Roi Domb, Sgt. Amnon Kadmonand Sgt. Gad Meinfeld. Maj. Yuval Veinstein and Staff Sgt. Guy Talwere to be buried Wednesday.   In a eulogy at the funeral for Meinfeld, his commander said theguerrillas were headed to northern Israel to commit ``killing andmurder.''   ``The terrorists' mission was foiled,'' Peled said. ``Thesettlements of the north are safe. The price is unbearable.''</TEXT></DOC>
