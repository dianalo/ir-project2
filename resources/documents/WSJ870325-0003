The Pentagon chief predicted that a new class of intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, being developed by the Soviets could be more efficient and accurate than SS-18 missiles, which now form the core of the Soviet strategic arsenal.    Unveiling the latest edition of &quot;Soviet Military Power,&quot; the Pentagon's annual assessment of changes in Soviet weaponry, Mr. Weinberger also reported that the Soviets are flight-testing seven supersonic Blackjack bombers. The bombers, which are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped AS-15 cruise missiles, are larger and faster than the latest U.S. bomber, the B-1B.    Mr. Weinberger described a Soviet force that is still growing across the board. He said the Soviets have launched their fifth Typhoon-class and fourth Delta IV-class ballistic missile submarines. The 25,000-metric ton Typhoon carries 20 SSN-20 missiles and outweighs the U.S. Navy's Ohio-class boats by about a third.    By the mid-1990s, not only will the Typhoon and Delta IV classes make up the bulk of the Soviets' strategic undersea force but also an entirely new class that carries improved versions of the SS-20 and SSN-23 missiles could be ready to be deployed, Mr. Weinberger said.    Mr. Weinberger also confirmed reports by other Defense Department officials that Soviet-built lasers have been used in Afghanistan and elsewhere. He confirmed that the lasers had accidentally blinded pilots temporarily and caused other battlefield casualties.    Although earlier editions of &quot;Soviet Military Power&quot; have reported on the Soviet use of laser technology in antimissile research, this was the first U.S. disclosure that the Soviets have used lasers on the conventional battlefield.    The Pentagon has released annual editions of the report for the past six years to help Mr. Weinberger win support for his defense budget requests. There is no apparent relationship between the timing of this edition and the current round of talks in Geneva on eliminating intermediate-range missiles in Europe.    The defense secretary acknowledged that U.S. plans to mount 50 of its 100 MX missiles on trains and 500 of its single-warhead Midgetman missiles on blast-resistant trucks are a response to the growth of mobile missiles in the Soviet arsenal. The report estimates that there are now 100 truck-hauled SS-25s, up from an estimated 70 last year. He also predicted that the Soviets will deploy their rail-mobile SS-25s &quot;next year about this time.&quot;    Mr. Weinberger said the Soviets have made impressive gains in conventional weapons as well. He reported that two new Soviet combat helicopters, the Havoc and the Hokum, will go into production soon. The U.S. has no equivalent for the Hokum, which U.S. intelligence agencies say is designed solely for air-to-air combat. Such helicopters, Mr. Weinberger warned, could threaten the ability of U.S. helicopters to counter the Soviet tank advantage.    Other reported Soviet advances include:    --Installation of reactive armor, which deflects or dissipates the impact of antitank munitions, to better protect T-80s, their newest battletanks.    --More frequent training flights of long-range Bear H bombers against presumed North American targets. Some of those flights were intercepted by U.S. Air Force fighters within 50 miles of the Alaskan coast.    --Near-completion of the Soviets' first full-scale aircraft carrier, the Leonid Brezhnev. Mr. Weinberger said the U.S. could better anticipate what kind of planes it can carry as soon as its flight deck is installed. By comparison, the U.S. has 14 aircraft carriers. </TEXT></DOC>
