All the sources are at low galactic latitude andmost of them have soft X-ray fluxes in the range 10 to the -13th to 10to the -12th erg/sq cm sec. Significant flux variations have been detectedin 17 sources. A strong flare, with a flux increase of a factor of about100 in about 400 sec, has been discovered in an optically unidentifiedsource. This is probably a dwarf M flare star or an RS CVn system. 40references.</TEXT></DOC>
