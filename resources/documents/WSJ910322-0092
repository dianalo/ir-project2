Presidents have come and gone, but fordecades Mr. Clifford has sat atop the three branches of thecapital's permanent government: law, money and politics.   He presides over one of the city's most influential lawfirms, Clifford andamp; Warnke, just a few steps from the WhiteHouse. As chairman of First American Bankshares Inc., hecontrols an $11 billion banking empire. As the dean of theDemocratic Party, he has been sought out for counsel bypractically every major Democratic figure since the Trumanadministration.</LP><TEXT>   But at age 84, Mr. Clifford finds himself defending thisgolden resume against the blight of scandal, thanks to hislate-in-life foray into banking with a group of MiddleEastern money men.   The pressure has been mounting for at least two years. TheCustoms Service cracked down on money laundering at a majorClifford client, the Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International.Senate investigators began tussling with him over documents.And finally, late last year, an aggressive prosecutor in NewYork put the spotlight on Mr. Clifford himself: Thesuperlawyer's own Washington-based bank, investigators nowbelieve, was unlawfully controlled by the money-launderingBCCI, partly through Arab investors who were Mr. Clifford'sbanking partners.   A chorus of media coverage -- in this newspaper, theWashington Post and CBS's &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; among other places --has called attention to Mr. Clifford's actions at a time whenhe had planned to bask in the sunset of an illustriouscareer.   Did Clark Clifford do anything wrong? Was he a majorplayer in a subterfuge to hide the corrupt ownership of amajor U.S. bank? Or, as Mr. Clifford says, was he duped intoacting as a front man?   Whatever the case, a close look at the Clifford affairreveals that his reputation and influence were instrumentalin keeping the artifice together. &quot;I mean, Clark Clifford issort of the godfather of the Democratic party,&quot; a BCCIofficial once explained -- to a Customs agent with a hiddentape recorder. More recently, Mr. Clifford's influence helpedshort-circuit a Senate investigation of BCCI's affairs.   Also caught in the BCCI maelstrom is Robert Altman, Mr.Clifford's law partner and younger alter ego. Mr. Altman andhis wife, the actress Lynda Carter (TV's Wonder Woman) arefixtures on Washington's A-list, playing host to fetes --such as the recent 45th birthday party for White Houseeconomist Michael Boskin -- at their Gatsby-like home inPotomac, Md. While his mentor plays Mr. Democrat, Mr. Altmanand his wife have embraced well-placed Republicans, such asCommerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and TransportationSecretary Samuel Skinner and their wives.   Mr. Altman says the media are making too many assumptionsbefore all the facts are in. &quot;People are jumping toconclusions about BCCI's control&quot; of First American, he says.&quot;We don't even know that as a matter of fact.&quot;   Official Washington, meanwhile, is shaking its head inwonder. &quot;I just don't think anyone believes Clark Cliffordcould be involved with anything that isn't on the up and up,&quot;says Debbie Dingell, the powerhouse wife of Rep. JohnDingell, the influential Michigan Democrat and a close friendof the Altmans.   During an interview this week, Mr. Clifford passionatelydefended himself against all allegations of impropriety. &quot;Therecord that I have here has been built very carefully overmany years,&quot; he said. It was only two months ago, he says,that he learned that his bank, First American, was at leastin part secretly owned by BCCI.   How could all this have happened?                                                                                                          Reassuring the Regulators                                                                                                          Messrs. Clifford and Altman forged their relationship withBCCI in the late 1970s, when the foreign bank was acting asfinancial adviser to some Arab investors trying to buy intowhat was then Financial General Bankshares of Washington.Financial General was a plum property. At a time when fewbanks could conduct business across state lines, it had abranch network stretching from New York to Tennessee.Eventually, it would be renamed First American.   BCCI, for its part, was hell-bent on global growth.Founded in 1972 by Pakistani banker Hasan Abedi, BCCI swelledin the 1970s, setting up offices throughout the Middle East,Europe, Africa and Asia. But its unorthodox structure -- withtwo holding companies in the lightly regulated tax havens ofLuxembourg and the Cayman Islands -- made some regulatorswary. The Bank of England refused to give BCCI full bankingstatus, while New York banking authorities rejected aneffort, involving BCCI, to acquire the Bank of Chelsea.   But Mr. Clifford was impressed with his client, Mr. Abedi,calling him &quot;a visionary.&quot; In 1977, the investor group beingadvised by BCCI -- including the former intelligence chief ofSaudi Arabia -- began gobbling up Financial General stock.   Eventually the takeover required approval from a bevy ofregulators, who gathered in Washington on April 23, 1981, ata hearing held by the Federal Reserve. Just who, theregulators wanted to know, was really proposing to buy thebank? Not BCCI, Mr. Clifford said.   &quot;There is no function of any kind on the part of BCCI,&quot;asserted Mr. Clifford, flanked by four Arab investors. &quot;Iknow of no present relationship. I know of no planned futurerelationship that exists.&quot;   Referring to the proposed holding companies for FirstAmerican -- called Credit andamp; Commerce American Holdings andCredit andamp; Commerce Investment N.B. -- Mr. Altman told thehearing &quot;there is no connection between those entities andBCCI, in terms of ownership or other relationship.&quot; Thesimilarity of the holding company names with BCCI's, theWashington lawyers insisted, was pure coincidence.   Mr. Clifford says he was assured by Mr. Abedi and byshareholder Kamal Adham, the former Saudi intelligence chief,that the individual shareholders, not BCCI, were putting upthe money to buy the bank. He says it will be proved that atleast some of the shareholders did use their own money.   He was aware that all of the shareholders banked at BCCI.&quot;The men we met appeared to be men of character,&quot; he adds. Hesays numerous government investigators checked thebackgrounds of the investors and came up empty-handed.   But some of those regulators were relying on Mr.Clifford's own assurances that BCCI wasn't involved -- and onMr. Clifford's reputation for integrity.   Sidney Bailey, a Virginia bank regulator, recalls the 1981hearing well. &quot;It was our understanding that they {FirstAmerican} would be distinct and separate from BCCI and thatthere would be no connection with BCCI whatsoever,&quot; he says.&quot;These were absolute assurances.&quot;   The New York state banking authority was the lastregulator to sign off on the takeover. Muriel Siebert, theformer head of that agency, concedes that she too reliedmainly on Mr. Clifford's word. &quot;If we had known about {BCCI'srole} we wouldn't have allowed it to go through,&quot; she says.   Later, after she had returned from state service to herbrokerage firm, she says she received a fee of &quot;$50,000 or$100,000&quot; for her role in helping find a buyer for FirstAmerican's Bank of Commerce unit in New York. She says thetransaction had no connection to her former role as aregulator.   Mr. Clifford agreed to become First American's chairmanafter receiving assurances that he would have &quot;fullauthority&quot; and that the shareholders would play only apassive role, with Mr. Abedi serving as their investmentadviser. Mr. Altman became First American's president.   With its new name and new leaders, First American expandedrapidly. Each time a new acquisition was made, Messrs.Clifford and Altman made the same assurances: BCCI was in noway involved in the running of their bank. The role of Mr.Clifford's law firm grew alongside the bank. The firm servedas the bank's attorneys, receiving millions in legal feesannually, and continued as counsel to BCCI.   Throughout the 1980s, both men made trips to London tobrief Mr. Abedi on First American's affairs. When FirstAmerican needed money to make an acquisition, for example,Mr. Clifford says he distributed rights offerings to theshareholders through Mr. Abedi, who would see some of theFirst American shareholders on trips to the Persian Gulf.   He insists that neither Mr. Abedi nor anyone else at BCCIwas ever involved in the management of First American. &quot;Notfor one hour during any day,&quot; he asserts. Although at leastone prospective First American executive was flown to Londonto meet Mr. Abedi, Mr. Clifford now says Mr. Abedi played norole in hiring decisions. Mr. Clifford says it was natural toseek Mr. Abedi's opinion of the job applicant, since he wasbeing considered for an international banking post.   Both Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman went to some length todiscourage inquiries into the ownership of First American. Ina lawsuit filed by a disgruntled shareholder of FirstAmerican's Virginia bank, the two lawyers foughtunsuccessfully to keep out of court any evidence about theinvestors who controlled their bank.   So who really did buy First American?   Investigators for New York County District Attorney RobertMorgenthau have established this much: Early on, perhaps atthe outset, several shareholders in the shell corporationsthat were buying First American had borrowed the money to payfor their shares from BCCI. In at least some cases they neverrepaid those loans or paid interest on them, lawyers say,adding that since the loans were effectively collateralizedwith the stock, BCCI soon had paper control of FirstAmerican's parent. The bank was, in effect, a secret whollyowned subsidiary of BCCI.                                                                                                          Influence on the Hill                                                                                                          It was drug money that led regulators to the trueownership of First American.   In early 1988, Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat,launched a money-laundering probe in his narcotics-tradesubcommittee, part of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.BCCI quickly became a focus. Former Panamanian consul generalJose Blandon told the subcommittee that the bank was part ofManuel Noriega's &quot;criminal empire.&quot;   The investigation was explosive -- but in the cozy worldof Democratic politics, so was the fact that BCCI wasrepresented by Clifford andamp; Warnke. Mr. Clifford's status asDemocratic insider carries great weight on the hill. For onething, he was active in a political action committee headedby Pamela Harriman, wife of the late ambassador W. AverillHarriman, that helped bankroll Democratic Senate campaigns.Clifford andamp; Warnke is a Democratic powerhouse in its ownright; its partners have given almost $150,000 to variousDemocratic campaign committees since 1985.   The Kerry subcommittee obtained intriguing leads. AmjadAwan, a BCCI official, testified in detail about his handlingof Mr. Noriega's finances. And in early 1989, investigatorsobtained checks totaling several thousand dollars that borethe inscription &quot;Noriega&quot; in the lower left corner. Thechecks had been passed through a BCCI account held at a FirstAmerican branch in Washington. Mr. Clifford says he didn'tknow about the checks, noting the vast quantity oftransactions handled by his bank.   But Sen. Kerry's investigation quickly ran into a bigtechnical problem: too little time. The full ForeignRelations Committee, headed by Sen. Claiborne Pell, had setearly 1989 as a deadline; funds for the probe would then runout. But by the end of 1988, Jack Blum, then the Kerrycommittee's top investigator, still didn't have the documentshe needed to initiate a public hearing on the BCCI case.   Then, when he returned from an out-of-town trip in early1989, he learned Mr. Clifford had called Sen. Pell seeking anextension to answer one of the subcommittee's subpoenas. Theextension, which Sen. Pell granted, delayed the submission ofmaterial by Mr. Clifford beyond the date on which Mr. Blumwas required to complete his investigation, effectivelyderailing the probe. Public hearings were never held.   &quot;Pell and Clifford have known each other for years andyears,&quot; explains Geryld Christianson, who, as the committee'sstaff director, handled the request from Mr. Clifford. &quot;Heasked for an extension, and I said I didn't see why not.&quot;But, he adds, &quot;Clifford never invoked the friendship in hisdiscussions with Pell, nor did Pell with me.&quot; Sen. Pellreceived a $1,000 contribution from Mr. Clifford in May of1990.   After winding down his investigation, Sen. Kerry alsoreceived a total of $3,000 in contributions from Mr. Cliffordand one of his law partners. Sen. Kerry says that, during thestillborn investigation, he wasn't aware that Mr. Cliffordintended to contribute.   Mr. Clifford says he wasn't throwing around any politicalweight. &quot;At no time have I used political influence,&quot; hesays.                                                                                                          A Slap on the Wrist                                                                                                          Separately, other investigators also were also watchingBCCI. Starting in 1986, the U.S. customs service had mountedits own probe of BCCI's money-laundering activities.   An undercover sting code-named Operation C-Chase waspassing Colombian drug cartel money through BCCI. By October1988 the bank and several of its senior officers wereindicted in Tampa on charges of laundering more than $14million. And BCCI's legal advisers quickly rode to therescue.   Messrs. Clifford and Altman assembled a team of Washingtonand Florida lawyers to press the defense, which ultimatelycost at least $10 million. That team over several monthsnegotiated a settlement in which a BCCI unit pleaded guiltyto money-laundering charges. In addition, five BCCI officersreceived prison terms.   But the $14.6 million in fines was seen as little morethan a slap on the wrist of an institution that had virtuallymade itself a full-service bank for money-launderers. Theplea agreement was so &quot;lenient,&quot; contended a report preparedby Sen. Kerry's staff, that it could undermine &quot;deterrence ofother financial institutions from laundering money.&quot;   Once again, the superlawyers went into action. Mr. Altmanapproached another powerful friend, Sen. Orrin Hatch, asenior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, whose blessingwould add considerable credibility to the Tampa settlement.&quot;I'd known him and his wife for years,&quot; Mr. Hatch says of Mr.Altman. &quot;I think he is a fine fellow. I believe he wasstraight and blunt with me.&quot;   The Utah Republican says he also talked to representativesfrom the Justice Department who &quot;felt they had done a goodjob and that they were being slammed,&quot; Mr. Hatch explains.   Thus, on Feb. 22, 1990, Sen. Hatch made a ringingendorsement of the settlement in the Congressional Record.Even though BCCI had pleaded guilty to 31 felony counts,&quot;there was no systematic money laundering uncovered in theBCCI case after intensive investigation,&quot; Mr. Hatch'sstatement asserted. He also commended BCCI for the&quot;responsible way the company has responded to the charges inthese proceedings.&quot;   Recently, at Sen. Hatch's request, Mr. Altman and hisTV-star wife put in a celebrity appearance at a charityfunction that the senator helped sponsor for the NationalFoundation for Depressive Illness. Sen. Hatch says he standsby his actions and emphasizes that he subsequently workedwith Sen. Kerry on proposed money-laundering legislation.   But the Justice Department had learned more about BCCI. Itobtained strong evidence that BCCI was surreptitiouslycontrolling Washington's First American Bank -- evidence thatthe department never passed along to banking regulators.   Law-enforcement investigators learned of the relationshipstraight from Mr. Awan, the BCCI official. Acting &quot;throughprivate individuals,&quot; Mr. Awan said, &quot;BCCI has bought andcontrols First American Bank,&quot; according to a summary of hisstatements compiled and sworn to by an agent of the InternalRevenue Service. He said individuals, rather than BCCI, wereused to buy First American because U.S. law blocked BCCI fromthe transaction. &quot;Clark Clifford,&quot; he went on to say, &quot;is oneof the persons who is working on behalf of BCCI.&quot;   Mr. Awan went so far as to say that Mr. Clifford wasslowing down the Senate investigation of BCCI that was underway at that time.   Plainly, BCCI was grateful to have Messrs. Clifford andAltman as its men in the capital. &quot;Our attorneys there,they're heavyweights,&quot; Mr. Awan said in a taped conversationwith an undercover agent from U.S. Customs. &quot;We own a bankbased in Washington, it's called First American,&quot; he adds.The &quot;truth of the matter is that the bank belongs to BCCI.Those guys are just nominee shareholders,&quot; he says of theArab investors.   BCCI's lawyers go out of their way to undercut Mr. Awan'sstatements. &quot;He doesn't know this firsthand. He picked it upas office or organizational rumor, and he's asserting it,&quot;says John Hume, who represented Mr. Awan in themoney-laundering proceedings.   As soon as his Senate investigation was terminated Mr.Blum took his suspicions to Robert Morgenthau, the New YorkCounty district attorney who has made money laundering a toptarget of his office. Last fall, Mr. Morgenthau's officepresented the evidence to bank regulators that BCCIeffectively held a controlling stake in First American Bank'sholding company.   As a result, the Federal Reserve recently demanded thatBCCI and First American keep their businesses separate. Italso demanded that BCCI submit plans to sell its controllingstake in First American Bank's parent. The Senate bankingcommittee is saying it will look into the Fed's proceduresfor screening foreign banks that want to set up in the U.S.   And Messrs. Clifford and Altman seem hurt and surprised atthe revelations. If regulators were fooled about BCCI'ssecret ownership, so, they say, were they. Despite theirfrequent contact with BCCI's principals, they -- and theyalone -- have been making decisions for the bank, Mr.Clifford says. In any case, their law firm's relationshipwith BCCI was severed in October.   Messrs. Clifford and Altman are now devoting themselves todamage control, working with a team of criminal defenselawyers and public relations specialists.   While Mr. Altman was recently seen power-lunching with thetelevision host Larry King, some of his other friends areputting distance between themselves and the flashy lawyer.When asked about his relationship with the Altmans, forexample, Mr. Boskin, the president's top economist, stressedthrough a spokesman that during two Christmas skiing holidaysin Aspen, his family and the Altmans &quot;skied on differentmountains.&quot;   Mr. Clifford, meanwhile, tries to concentrate on happierdevelopments. His memoirs, due to be published in June, arebeing serialized beginning this week in the New Yorker.   But official Washington is pondering a different mystery:Why would Clark Clifford, who was already a millionaire, casthis lot with these money men? The answer, he says, is that hewasn't looking forward to retirement and that his lawpractice no longer intrigued him. &quot;When this came along I waschallenged by it,&quot; he explains.   He is getting ready to tell his side of the story -- incourt if necessary: &quot;When the time comes I will raise my handand make an oath, that at no time have Mr. Abedi, Mr. Adham,or any of the investors made a decision for First AmericanBank,&quot; Mr. Clifford says.</TEXT></DOC>
