Unlike other areas of arms control, cuts of conventional weaponry can't be described meaningfully in mere numbers. Europeans haven't forgotten how Hitler attacked both France and Russia with tanks and aircraft that were inferior, both in quality and quantity, to each country's forces.    Both NATO and the Soviets talk of a shift in strategic doctrine to emphasize defense over offense. But neither side seems able to define clearly how an army must train, supply and mobilize itself so that an adversary, simply through monitoring, can be sure the other side isn't capable of offensive procedures -- ones aimed at taking and holding territory.    Several months ago, a task force of military experts from the U.S., Britain, Italy, France and West Germany began meeting regularly to prepare conventional-arms proposals based on a &quot;non-offensive defense.&quot; Such proposals would go well beyond merely reducing military hardware, such as tanks and artillery, according to NATO officials.    Developing these proposals is extremely difficult, the group has found. Until recently, the only experts thinking about a non-offensive defense were a few academics and left-wing politicians.    Horst Afheldt, a West German physicist and military strategist, is widely regarded as a pioneer. Since the mid-1970s, Mr. Afheldt has written articles on how to defend West Germany without tanks, self-propelled artillery and attack aircraft.    His idea: small units of &quot;techno-commandos&quot; that would use high-technology anti-tank weapons, mines and precision-guided rockets to fight over large areas. For protection, they would rely on the natural land contours and a network of small bunkers and barriers. Such a force could annihilate a large part of an invading enemy's armor, he believes.    The special units wouldn't require airfields, concentrated military formations, large ammunition dumps or other targets that could tempt an enemy nuclear strike. One of Mr. Afheldt's goals is to move East and West away from their dependence on nuclear weapons.    &quot;Just 10% of the superpowers' nuclear arsenals is enough to solve central European problems -- forever,&quot; says Mr. Afheldt. &quot;My position is that the things we threaten to use must be things which we really can use.&quot;    After publishing the book &quot;Defense and Peace,&quot; Mr. Afheldt discovered that a French major and a West German general had been working on similar theories. But in the late 1970s a more hawkish mood settled over NATO in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Mr. Afheldt discovered not all generals liked his ideas.    The French major was transferred to Beijing, the West German general to Rome and Mr. Afheldt's sponsor, the West German Defense Ministry, cut off his research funds.    In 1983, West Germany's main opposition party, the Social Democrats, revived Mr. Afheldt's concepts as a way to draw support away from the Greens, a party that is attracting young Germans with environmental and peace issues. The Social Democrats wanted a more appealing alternative to unilateral disarmament: a potent defense force with a &quot;structural inability to attack.&quot;    Lutz Unterseher, a military expert who advises a committee of Social Democrats working on defense proposals, has expanded on Mr. Afheldt's ideas. Mr. Unterseher thinks new technology could make an austere, militia-style force that could stop an armored attack. He is interested in the FOG-M, a fiber-optics-guided missile being developed by the U.S. Army for use against tanks and helicopters.    Karsten Voigt, a leading Social Democratic arms expert in the West German parliament, suggests NATO could change the Warsaw Pact's forward-based, offensive strategy in Europe by proposing that both sides reduce armored units and emphasize defensive training, tactics and weapons. Observers from both alliances could verify implementation by closely watching each others' training maneuvers, he believes.    Many critics contend non-offensive defense won't work. The approach would &quot;fracture, if not disintegrate&quot; NATO because each member nation could withdraw into its own defensive shell, says David Gates, a professor at Scotland's University of Aberdeen.    Another critic is retired Gen. Sir Hugh Beach, a former military weapons procurement chief for the United Kingdom's land forces. But he expects that economic and political forces will drive both superpowers toward some of the new defense-oriented strategies in 10 to 15 years.    Military budgets of major NATO nations, he notes, are beginning to stagnate at no-growth levels, while the cost of weaponry escalates at 5% to 10% a year. Without major change, armies will shrink.    &quot;The Russians are in exactly the same bind as we are,&quot; Gen. Beach says. &quot;The situation is screaming for a negotiated force-reduction exercise.&quot;    How do the Russians feel? In October, Mr. Afheldt, Mr. Unterseher and several other Western experts on non-offensive strategies attended the Warsaw Pact's first symposium on non-offensive defense in Warna, Bulgaria. Soviet specialists there showed a great deal of interest. They even had picked up buzzwords such as &quot;defensive structures,&quot; and &quot;military efficiency,&quot; Mr. Afheldt recalls.    &quot;But what they really mean by that, at this point, nobody knows.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
