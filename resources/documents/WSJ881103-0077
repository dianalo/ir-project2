Hughes (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ROK </CO><IN> ERN ARO </IN><DATELINE> EL SEGUNDO, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rockwell International Corp., aided by a lower tax rate, reported a 33% rise in net income for the fiscal fourth quarter although operating profit slid sharply.    The aerospace, electronics and automotive concern reported net for the quarter, ended Sept. 30, of $185.9 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $140 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago.    Sales rose 3% to $3.2 billion from $3.1 billion for the year-ago quarter.    Rockwell set aside $35.6 million for taxes in the recent quarter, roughly a third of the $118.2 million set aside in the year-ago quarter. The favorable tax adjustment resulted primarily from deferred income from the B-1B aircraft program to this year, with its lower tax rate.    Operating profit dropped 15% to $263.8 million from $310.9 million a year ago; the biggest declines were in the company's aerospace operations. Aerospace earnings dropped 30% mostly as a result of Rockwell's completion of the B-1B aircraft production.    Rockwell also said it set up a reserve for &quot;potential cost problems on modernizing a weapons system,&quot; which also hurt aerospace results. A company spokesman declined to disclose the amount of that reserve or to identify the weapon system.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Rockwell's stock closed at $21.625, down 37.5 cents.    Jack Modzelewski, an aerospace analyst at PaineWebber Inc., speculated Rockwell's potential cost problems are linked to the company's contract to modernize the C-130 gunship. The company bid aggressively against Lockheed Corp. for that contract last June; Mr. Modzelewski estimated the reserve is probably more than $40 million.    Earnings of Rockwell's automotive and general industries operations climbed for the quarter. Earnings for both the quarter and year were in line with analysts' expectations, Mr. Modzelewski said.    For the fiscal year, Rockwell reported net of $811.9 million, or $3.04 a share, up 28% from the year-ago $635.1 million, or $2.27 a share. Operating profit was $1.2 billion, down 8% from $1.3 billion for the year earlier. The company set aside $241.1 million for taxes, less than half the $551.6 million set aside a year ago.    Sales for the year were $11.9 billion, down 2% from the $12.1 billion reported for the year-ago period.    Donald R. Beall, chairman and chief executive officer, said he expects the company will be able to post higher per-share earnings in 1989, noting Rockwell's position in the markets, its backlog and benefits from restructuring efforts.    Mr. Beall also said: &quot;Our 1988 earnings per-share are the highest in the company's history, even after excluding the favorable tax adjustment.&quot; He added that the 1988 results &quot;demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategic diversification of the company's businesses.&quot;    A spokesman said the company had an average of 266.6 million common shares outstanding in the 1988 fiscal year, compared with 280 million in fiscal 1987. The reduction reflects the company's stock-repurchase program. </TEXT></DOC>
