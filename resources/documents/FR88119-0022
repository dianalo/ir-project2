The plants would be required to ship to pool distributing plants5 percent of the total milk production received from dairy farmers or divertedby the plant operator during each month of August and December, and 8 percentof such receipts during each of the months of September, October and Novemberin order to maintain their pool status. Two or more reserve supply plantswould be allowed to have their receipts and shipments to pool plants consideredon a combined, or unit, basis to meet the minimum shipping requirementsor a ``call'' by the market administrator for milk supplies needed forClass I, or fluid, use. However, each plant in such a unit would have toship at least 5 percent of its receipts on an individual basis during onemonth of any August through December period in order to qualify for poolstatus during the month of December.A proposal to reduce the current requirement that a daily average of atleast 25,000 pounds of Grade A milk from dairy farmers be received at apool reserve supply plant is denied.The decision is based on the record of a public hearing held July 7-8,1987, in Bloomington, Minnesota. The proposed changes were submitted andsupported by six cooperative associations that represent a substantialproportion of producers who supply milk to the market. The changes arenecessary to assure an adequate supply of milk in an orderly manner forClass I (fluid) use in the Upper Midwest marketing area.Other issues considered at the hearing were whether the operator of oneor more distributing plants and one or more soft-products (cream items,cottage cheese and yogurt but excluding ice cream) plants located withinthe marketing area should be allowed to have such plants considered asone plant or unit, for pooling purposes, and whether the proposals consideredat the hearing should be handled in an expedited manner. A separate decisionon those issues was issued September 2, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments are due on or before February 8, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments (four copies) should be filed with the HearingClerk, Room 1079, South Building, United States Department of Agriculture,Washington, DC, 20250.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Constance M.

This notice is issued pursuant to the provisions of theAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674),and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulationof marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR Part 900).Interested parties may file written exceptions to this decision with theHearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, 20250, bythe 20th day after publication of this decision in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Four copies of the exceptions should be filed.All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made availablefor public inspection at the office of the Hearing Clerk during regularbusiness hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).  The proposed amendment(s) set forth below are based on the record of apublic hearing held at Bloomington, Minnesota, on July 7-8, 1987, pursuantto a notice of hearing issued June 19, 1987 (52 FR 23843).  The material issue on the record of hearing that is dealt with in thisdecision is whether reserve supply plants should be required to ship minimumpercentages of their producer milk receipts to pool distributing plantsin order to qualify for pool status under the order.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions  </ITAG>The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are basedon evidence presented at the hearing and the record thereof:  Reserve Supply Plant Shipping Standards  The Upper Midwest order should be changed to require pool reserve supplyplants to ship a minimum percentage of their receipts to pool distributingplants during the months of August through December. Handlers would beallowed to have their receipts and shipments considered as a unit for purposesof determining whether pooling standards have been met. However, each plantin a unit would have to deliver at least 5 percent of its producer receiptsto pool distributing plants during one month of the August through Decemberperiod in order to qualify for pooling during the month of December. Atthe present time, reserve supply plants are subject to no minimum shippingrequirements to qualify for pooling unless the market administrator findsthat milk supplies for Class I use are needed at pool distributing plantsand issues a ``call'' for such supplies.  The change was proposed by six cooperative associations that representa majority of the producers supplying milk to the Upper Midwest market.The cooperative associations are Land O'Lakes, Inc. (LOL), Mid-AmericaDairymen, Inc. (Mid-Am), Cass-Clay Creamery, Inc., Wisconsin Dairies Cooperative,First District Association and Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI).Representatives of five of the proponents and a witness for Marigold Foods,the operator of three fluid milk plants under the order, testified in favorof the proposal. The proposed changes would require reserve supply plantsto ship a minimum of 5 percent of their total supply of Grade A producermilk to pool distributing plants during the months of August and December,and 8 percent during September through November, in order to be pool plants.Under the proposal, reserve supply plants that meet the shipping standardsduring the months of August through December would continue to be pooledfor the following months of January through July. The proposal would allowtwo or more reserve supply plants operated by the same handler to be pooledas a unit by having their receipts and shipments to distributing plantsconsidered on a combined basis. Under the proposal, the minimum shippingstandards could be reduced on a temporary basis by the Director of theDairy Division. The present provision allowing the market administratorto issue a ``call'' for additional needed supplies of milk for Class Iuse would remain in the order. Proponents' would reduce the current requirementthat a reserve supply plant assemble at least a daily average milk supplyof 25,000 pounds to a 25,000-pound requirement on at least 2 consecutivedays of each month. Adoption of the proposal was opposed by witnesses testifyingon behalf of two cooperative assocations: Farmers Union Milk MarketingCooperative (Farmers Union) and National Farmers Organization (NFO); andon behalf of Kraft, Inc., Universal Foods, and the Trade Association ofProprietary Plants (TAPP).  The LOL witness testified that LOL operates eight reserve supply plantsand a distributing plant under the order, and supplies a significant partof the milk needed for Class I use at two other pool distributing plants.The witness stated that distributing plants in the Upper Midwest marketingarea have experienced continuing difficulty in securing dependable suppliesof milk in the absence of a ``call'' from the market administrator requiringreserve supply plants to ship milk for fluid needs. He attributed the reluctanceof reserve supply plant operators to ship milk to distributing plants tothe substantial costs incurred in supplying milk for Class I use. The witnessstated that when a ``call'' is issued, plant operators can be assured thatmost of their competitors are sharing equitably in the cost of supplyingClass I milk to the market, but described the issuance of a ``call'' formilk as a procedure too cumbersome and defective to be used to secure milksupplies for the fluid needs of the market on a regular basis.  The witness explained that, in shipping milk to distributing plants forClass I use, reserve supply plant operators incur additional costs of runningduplicate Grade A and Grade B farm bulk pickup routes instead of operatingone commingled route, and hauling milk from supply plants to distributingplants. He estimated that such costs would be about 50 cents per hundredweightfor milk hauled 75 miles. In addition, the witness cited the cost of releasingGrade A milk of Class I use from a supply plant that is also a manufacturingplant. He stated that under-utilization of a manufacturing plant's capacitybecause of the necessity of shipping milk for Class I use may cost $10,000per day, or range from $1.25-$1.43 per hundredweight of Class I milk shipped.The witness pointed out that, in view of the unreimbursed costs of shippingClass I milk to distributing plants, plant operators that do not ship enjoya competitive advantage over those that do. He stated that it is more expensivefor supply plant operators to remove milk from their manufacturing operationsduring the fall, when manufacturing plants are operating at below-capacitylevels because of lower levels of milk production, than at any other timeof the year.  The LOL witness testified that the only factors that serves to offset thecosts of releasing milk for Class I use are location adjustments providedunder the order and over-order premiums. He said that the location adjustmenton most reserve supply plants is only 6 cents, or a small fraction of thecost of supplying milk for Class I use, and that the premium customarilycharged in addition to the order price for milk delivered for Class I useduring the fall months is 60 cents per hundredweight. The witness statedthat the economic incentives available to reimburse reserve supply plantoperators for shipping Class I milk will cover the costs of such shipmentsonly for those reserve supply plants located relatively near the market,and are, for the most part, inadequate to assure a large enough supplyof milk for Class I use.             The witness testified that the threat of a ``call'' for Class I milk shipmentby the market administrator under the present order has served as a shippingrequirement for many years, but that its effectiveness has diminished recentlyin view of declining milk supplies. He stated that the ``call'' provisionhad to be used for three consecutive months in the fall of 1986 in orderto obtain an adequate supply of Class I milk for distributing plants. Thewitness characterized use of the ``call'' as assuring that most competitorsare sharing equitably in the cost of supplying Class I milk.According to the LOL witness, all reserve supply plants that share in themarket's Class I returns by sharing in the order's blend price also shouldshare in the burden of supplying Class I milk to fluid milk plants. Thewitness asserted that mandatory shipping standards are the only reasonablemechanism to insure that all reserve supply plants ship Class I milk ata minimal level. He described minimum shipping requirements as eliminatingdoubt about whether it will be necessary for reserve supply plants to shipClass I milk to distributing plants. Under the present order provisions,he explained, there is uncertainty on the part of reserve supply plantoperators as to whether they will be required to ship milk for Class Iuse until a call is actually announced, usually about the first day ofthe month for which deliveries are to be required. The witness furtherstated that mandatory shipping percentages will encourage reserve supplyplant operators to make advance arrangements to supply Class I customerson a regular basis rather than having to find a Class I outlet after acall is announced. He indicated that minimum shipping requirements wouldencourage reserve supply plant operators to more closely monitor qualitydiscipline at producers' farms and to assure that their plants are capableof delivering high-quality milk to distributing plants. The witness statedthat planning and orderly operation of both manufacturing plants and distributingplants, and more orderly movement of milk from production areas to themarketplace, would be enhanced by requiring the timing and volume of milkmovements to be established well in advance for the purpose of meetingthe order's minimum shipping standards.The LOL witness supported the cooperatives' proposed 5 percent and 8 percentshipping requirements on the basis that these percentages would not compelreserve supply plants to ship more milk than would be needed at distributingplants, but would be near the actual volume of milk needed from reservesupply plants. The witness stated that approximately half of the milk suppliesreceived at pool distributing plants during August through December 1986originate at supply and reserve supply plant, and that the total milk suppliesfrom pool sources represented about 17 percent of the producer milk pooledunder the order. The witness supplied data indicating that the actual shipmentsto distributing plants from supply and reserve supply plants during 1986exceeded the mandatory shipping percentages proposed by proponents. Henoted that if the proposed percentage shipping requirements prove to beinadequate or excessive in the future, the market administrator would retainthe authority to issue a ``call'' for increased shipments, and the Directorof the Dairy Division would be authorized to reduce the level of shipmentsrequired. The LOL witness testified that the months of August through Decemberare the time of year when Class I requirements are greatest, while theopportunity cost to manufacturing operations of supplying milk for ClassI use is also greatest. He stated that adoption of minimum performancestandards for all pool participants would ease the market supply problemscurrently experienced during the fall months.The witness testified in favor of proponents' proposal to require thata reserve supply plant receive at least 25,000 pounds of milk on only twoconsecutive days during the month instead of the present requirement thatsuch a plant receive a daily average of at least 25,000 pounds of milk.He stated that the original intent of the present provision was to assurethat a reserve supply plant operator would have the capability of puttingtogether a tankerload of milk in two days for shipment to distributingplants. According to the witness, the proposed change would continue theoriginal intent, but would allow some savings in the cost of operatingreserve supply plants.A witness representing Wisconsin Dairies stated that the cooperative operatesfive reserve supply plants under the order. He testified that the UpperMidwest order was designed to further orderly marketing, and had done soquite well for ten years with the ``call'' provision used only once. However,he stated, use of the ``call'' provision for three consecutive months duringthe fall of 1986 was not conducive to orderly marketing. The witness testifiedthat Wisconsin Dairies was already shipping above any anticipated ``call''percentage in the fall of 1986 and felt that volunteering to ship additionalvolumes of milk was not a sound business practice when some reserve supplyplant operators were unwilling to serve the fluid milk market. He emphasizedthat since all reserve supply plants share in the market's Class I returnsit is only fair that all should share in serving the fluid milk needs ofthe market.A witness testifying on behalf of AMPI stated that AMPI operates eightreserve supply plants under the Upper Midwest order, and supplies milkto eight distributing plants. The witness testified that prior to September1986 the threat that the ``call'' provision would be implemented workedwell to assure an adequate supply of milk for Class I use. He stated thatsome suppliers shipped additional milk voluntarily while others gave upmilk reluctantly in response to the market administrator's indication thata ``call'' would be issued if needed Class I milk supplies were not suppliedto bottlers. The witness said that suppliers seem reluctant to ship ClassI milk under the current marketing conditions of declining production becauseof the value of additional milk to manufacturing plants, especially duringthe fall months of the year. He attributed the necessity of using the ``call''provision for three consecutive months in 1986 to the common understandingthat some suppliers, who are also competitors for producer milk, were shippinglittle or no milk to distributing plants. He described three months ofoperating under the ``call'' provision as having three months of shippingrequirements but not knowing what the required percentage would be untileach month started.The AMPI witness compared the percentages required by operation of the``call'' provision in September-November 1986 with the proposed percentagerequirements and determined that if the proposed requirements had beenin effect in the fall of 1986, the small amount of milk in excess of theproposed percentages that would have been required for Class I use couldhave been obtained easily by negotiations between distributing plant operatorsand the operators of reserve supply plants. The witness described marketingconditions in the presence of ``calls'' for three consecutive months ascharacterized by uncertainty and lack of planning between suppliers andcustomers, leading to disorderly marketing conditions. He testified thathe understood the proposal would allow the Director to increase, as wellas decrease, the shipping percentage required of reserve supply plants,or, in a situation that would not allow time for such action by the Director,to allow the market administrator to issue a ``call'' for additional shipments.A witness for Mid-Am testified that the association operates five reservesupply plants under the Upper Midwest order. The witness stated that oneof the primary purposes of the Federal order is to assure an adequate supplyof milk for distributing plants and consumers. He explained that as theamount of milk pooled under the Federal order increases, a smaller percentageof the total volume is needed to supply the market's fluid needs. As aresult, he said, an increasing percentage of producer milk is used in manufacturedproducts and handlers become accustomed to using producer milk in theirmanufacturing plants. The witness stated that the economic benefits tohandlers of not shipping milk to distributing plants interfere with theorderly flow of milk for Class I use. However, he asserted, any organizationparticipating in the blend price generated by Class I sales should acceptthe burden of supplying those sales, even if that burden includes shippingmilk two or three hundred miles for Class I use. He observed that the economicincentives provided both under the order and outside the order, such asover-order prices, are insufficient to pull milk away from use in manufacturingplants. At the same time, he said, the order's shipping provisions do notpush the milk out of the reserve supply plants unless a ``call'' is issued.The witness concluded that the ``call'' provision was not intended to beused on a frequent basis, and that mandatory shipping requirements arethe appropriate means of supplying the fluid needs of the market.The Mid-Am witness suggested that the proposed mandatory shipping standardsbe allowed to be met by units formed by two or more cooperative associationsin addition to the units to be permitted of multiple plants operated byone handler. He opposed allowing proprietary handlers to form units withcooperative associations or with other proprietary handlers. He statedthat the benefits of efficiencies resulting from the activities of a unitof cooperative associations would accrue to their dairy farmer members,but that efficiencies achieved by a unit of proprietary handlers may notbe passed back to dairy farmers. Mid-Am's proposed modification of theproposed shipping requirements was supported by the witness for LOL whostated that a unit pooling provision for cooperative associations wouldaccustom the associations to working together to increase their efficiencyand effectiveness in supply milk to the market.A witness for Cass-Clay Creamery, Inc., testified that Cass-Clay operatesthree distributing plants, one reserve supply plant and three supply plants,all pooled under the Upper Midwest order, and four nonpool manufacturingplants. The witness stated that milk supplies in the vicinity of its Fargo,North Dakota, fluid milk plant have been hard to obtain during the fallmonths of the last several years. He explained that Fargo was not withinthe designated area delineated by the market administrator for the ``calls''issued for Class I milk shipments in September through November 1986, andthat procurement of milk supplies for the Fargo plant was not, therefore,assisted by announcement of a ``call.'' In fact, the witness testified,the two or three reserve supply plants located near the Fargo area fromwhich milk might be available do not, to his knowledge, have InterstateMilk Shippers' (IMS) approval. He stated that without IMS approval suchmilk supplies would be of no use to the Cass-Clay distributing plant. Thewitness argued that if the supply of milk continues to decrease, not enoughwill be available for Class I use. He stated that milk must move to fluidoutlets as a result of either price incentives or performance requirements,and concluded that the proposed shipping standards would alleviate theproblem of inadequate price incentives and make the marketing of ClassI milk more equitable for all market participants.A witness representing Marigold Foods, a proprietary handler that is alarge purchaser of Grade A milk in the Upper Midwest market, testifiedthat adoption of a minimum shipping requirement for reserve supply plantswould assure all milk suppliers that producer groups sharing in the order'sblend price have performed some of the responsibility of delivering milkto the Class I market. He explained that reserve supply plants are ableto pay producers the Federal order blend price for all of their milk, whetherany of it is used in Class I or not, and therefore are able to competewith other handlers for a supply of milk that will enable them to operatetheir manufacturing plants at an optimal level. He stated that requiredshipping percentages would establish supply patterns by all suppliers participatingin the pool and may create a climate that would eliminate the need forany future ``calls.''The Marigold witness testified that in July 1986 Marigold began to tryto secure an adequate supply of milk for the fall period beginning withSeptember 1, 1986. He stated that it quickly became apparent that thosesuppliers who already supplied Marigold were not going to increase theirshipments, and that suppliers who did not already supply Marigold werenot going to start doing so. The witness testified that he had notifiedthe market administrator of his difficulty in obtaining milk supplies aboutAugust 1, and the market administrator started the procedure required toissue a ``call'' at that time. After the ``call'' for September 1986 wasissued, he continued, the procurement situation did not improve greatlybecause suppliers would ship milk to Marigold's plants only until theyhad fulfilled the ``call'' requirements. He stated that much of his timein the last half of 1986 was spent in trying to keep Marigold's plantsoperating, even though ``calls'' were also issued for October and November.The witness for Marigold testified that Marigold would like to be ableto offer a high enough price for its milk supply so that its plants couldbe assured of an adequate supply of milk on a year-round basis. However,he pointed out, Marigold cannot pay more than the prevailing price in themarket for its milk supply and still be able to compete for sales withhandlers paying less. The witness attributed suppliers' reluctance to shipmilk for Class I use to their desire to keep their milk supplies for theirown manufacturing plants.A witness representing Kraft, Inc., testified in opposition to the proposedmandatory shipping standards. He explained that Kraft operates a reservesupply plant under the Upper Midwest order, is a regular supplier of milkto the Class I market, and ships to distributing plants a percentage ofits total supply approximately equal to the market's percentage of ClassI use. The witness asserted that the current provisions of the order areflexible enough to adjust to the changing needs of the market while minimizingregulatory intervention. He stated that use of the call provision duringthe fall of 1986 accomplished the purpose for which it was intended, ofsupplying needed milk to pool distributing plants for Class I use. Althoughhe acknowledged the inequity between reserve supply plants that ship milkto the fluid market and those that do not, the witness asserted Kraft'sopposition to mandatory percentage requirements. He described mandatoryshipping standards as inflexible, and stated that their adoption may resultin requiring handlers to ship milk to the fluid market in excess of ClassI needs.In the event mandatory shipping requirements are adopted in spite of Kraft'sopposition, the Kraft witness suggested modifications to the proposed amendments.First, he stated, the director of the Dairy Division should have the discretionto reduce the required shipping percentages to zero instead of by 5 percent,as proposed by proponents. He argued that the reason for allowing the Directorto adjust shipping percentages is to save the time and expense of a Federalorder hearing proceeding, and that there is no point in limiting the Director'sdiscretion for the three months during which 8 percent of a reserve supplyplant's receipts are required to be shipped to distributing plants. Inaddition to allowing a multi-plant handler to qualify more than one reservesupply plant as a unit, as proposed by proponents, the Kraft witness advocatedthat any group of handlers be allowed to consider their reserve supplyplants as a unit for the purpose of meeting the minimum shipping requirements.He stated that allowing all handlers to form such units would maximizethe transportation efficiencies available to meet the Class I needs ofthe market, and would help defray the cost of complying with mandatoryshipping percentages for small or poorly-located handlers. Finally, theKraft witness proposed a modification to the proposed provision that wouldprotect a multiple-plant handler from losing pool status entirely if thepercentage shipping requirements are not met. He suggested that when sucha handler files a request with the market administrator for pool statusfor its reserve supply plants, the request should describe the sequencein which plants would be excluded from the unit in the event minimum performancestandards are not met. A witness representing Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC)also opposed the adoption of mandatory shipping requirements. He describedsuch requirements as unnecessary and undesirable in that the percentageof producer milk needed for Class I use in the Upper Midwest marketingarea is the lowest in the U.S., averaging only about 13 percent. Accordingto the FUMMC witness, the cause of the problem in getting milk to distributingplants is the unreasonably low handling charges established by the principalcooperatives in the market. He charged that proponent cooperatives owninterests in eight distributing plants that distribute milk in the UpperMidwest order area, and that, having kept the cost of obtaining milk supplieslow to themselves, they now want the government to require other handlersto give up profitable sales in order to supply milk for Class I use ata loss. The witness also noted that some of proponent cooperatives selllarge volumes of manufactured dairy products to the government on a year-roundbasis. He stated that any mandatory shipping standards should require thatmilk be used for sales to distributing plants rather than to the CommodityCredit Corporation. The FUMMC witness testified that proponents favor mandatory shipping percentagesin order to assure that handling charges on milk supplied to the fluidmarket remain at their present level of 50 or 60 cents per hundredeight.He attributed proponents' motive for keeping handling charges low to theirdesire for making it impossible for other organizations marketing producers'milk to compete for producer milk supplies. The witness stated that fourproprietary handlers, three of them small family-owned businesses, hadlost their pool status as a result of their failure to meet the shippingpercentages required by the ``calls'' issued during the fall months of1986. He pointed out that mandatory shipping requirements could be expectedto have the same effect on other handlers in similar positions. The FUMMCwitness testified that if mandatory shipping requirements are adopted,he would support a provision that would allow proprietary handlers, aswell as cooperative associations, to form units for the purpose of meetingthe required shipping percentages. A witness testifying on behalf of National Farmers Organization (NFO) opposedthe proposal to require a minimum level of shipments from reserve supplyplants to distributing plants. He stated that the present pooling provisionsof the Upper Midwest order were designed to accommodate the pooling ofan already abundant supply of Grade A milk and the milk of any Grade Bproducers who wish to upgrade to Grade A, and should continue to do so.The witness described the threat of implementation of the call provisionsas the single most effective tool in aligning buyers and sellers, and statedthat operating without using the call provision is in the best interestsof the market. He explained that without either a ``call'' for Class Imilk supplies or mandatory shipping percentages only milk that is neededfor fluid use moves to distributing plants. He observed that milk thatis moved for fluid use comes from the closest and most economical sources.The witness said that the entire marketing area has never been includedunder a ``call'', but that the area from which shipments are required undera ``call'' has been large enough so that the burden of supplying the requiredmilk for Class I use has never been borne too heavily by one organization.At the same time, he stated, the ``call'' area has never been large enoughto require very distant milk to be moved or excess shipping costs to beincurred. The witness observed that 34 percent of the milk pooled underthe order during December 1986 was produced within the area from whichmilk was ``called'' for Class I use during the fall months of 1986.The NFO representative testified that if mandatory shipping standards wereadopted, milk supplies very distant from the metropolitan area would berequired to move uneconomically to distributing plants or lose pool status.He used as an example a supply of NFO milk located near Benoit, Wisconsin,that would have to be shipped over 200 miles to the nearest distributingplant at a cost of 72 cents per hundredweight for transportation. Anotherexamsple cited by the wintess was a proprietary reserve supply plant locatedin eastern North Dakota. According to the witness, the three distributingplants located closest to this proprietary handler are all cooperative-owned,and depend on their own members' milk supplies. As a result, he said, Minneapolis/St.Paul, at a distance of 368 miles from the handler, would be the likeliestmarket for any milk the handler would be required to ship. The witnessstated that the transportation cost of such shipments would be $1.29 perhundredweight. He said that requiring such shipments when more than amplesupplies of milk are produced much closer to the market is not in the bestinterests of the market.The NFO witness explained that as milk supplies have declined, handlersthat have manufacturing operations are not willing to release greater suppliesof milk to distributing plants without being adequately compensated forthe costs they would incur as a result. The witness introduced data showingthat the service charges received for milk supplied to distributing plantsin Federal milk order areas surrounding the Upper Midwest are generallysomewhat higher (by $.28 to $1.11) than service charges paid by distribuingplants in the Upper Midwest order area. He noted that some NFO milk producedwithin the Upper Midwest milkshed is delivered to pool distributing plantsin other Federal order areas and pooled under those orders because theservice charges paid by the receiving handlers in those areas return muchmore money to the cooperative than do sales to Upper Midwest distributingplants.The witness for NFO stated that the cooperative historically has suppliedto distributing plants a higher percentage of its milk supply than themarketwide percentage of producer milk used in Class I, but will no longership milk from reserve supply plants without being able to recover directtransportation costs. The witness further warned that if mandatory shippingstandards are adopted, NFO would seriously consider reducing its shipmentsof milk for Class I use to just above the required percentage instead ofits current 27-percent level of performance. He predicted that the resultof adoption of minimum shipping requirements would be to reduce servicecharges below their current inadequate level and to generate excessivecosts of moving milk unnecessarily from reserve supply plants to distributingplants.The witness expressed NFO's opposition to reducing the 25,000 pound perday average receipt requirement at reserve supply plants. He describedthe current standard as minimal, and stated that reducing it would serveno constructive purpose even though one NFO reserve supply plant has failedto be pooled as a result of falling below the required volume of receipts.A witness testified in opposition to the proposal on behalf of UniversalFoods, a proprietary manufacturing plant operator whose producers are pooledthrough Twin Town Cheese Factory, Inc. Twin Town Cheese Factory is a cheesemanufacturing company that operates a reserve supply plant. The witnessstated that milk for Class I use is supplied to Upper Midwest distributingplants from the Twin Town plant on a year-round basis at a level that exceedsthe ``call'' percentages announced during the fall of 1986. He stated thatin order to obtain an adequate supply of producer milk, Twin Town mustpay producer premiums and hauling subsidies that result in milk costs thatrange from 80 cents to $1.00 over the Federal order blend price. He notedthat, given the cost of acquiring milk, supplying it to distributing plantsat 50 cents over the Class I price is not economical. The wintess alsostated that one of the results of adopting mandatory shipping standardswould be the reduction of the service charges currently collected for deliveriesof milk to distributing plants.A witness representing the Trade Association of Proprietary Plants (TAPP)testified in opposition to the proposed minimum shipping requirements.The witness said that the order's ``call'' provision has operated to assurean adequate supply of milk to handlers and consumers, making a minimumshipping percentage unnecessary. He explained that a required shippingpercentage of 5 to 8 percent coupled with a provision allowing the percentageto be increased or decreased at the discretion of the Dairy Division Directoris little different from the present ``call'' provision. He stated thatthe ``calls'' announced in the fall of 1986 involved most of the marketarea, and that the ``call'' provision could be applied on a marketwidebasis to assure that it would affect all reserve supply plant operatorsequally.The TAPP witness attributed the difficulty distributing plants experiencein securing an adequate supply of milk to proponent cooperatives' failureto develop an organization and pricing policy outside of the Federal orderto solve supply problems and develop equity between handlers and producerson an economically sound basis. He stated that the shipment of milk andorganization of the market is the primary responsibility of cooperatives.The witness testified that cooperative associations should organize toestablish over-order charges at a level that would be high enough to coverthe full cost of supplying milk to the Class I market and thereby encouragemilk shipments. Instead, he claimed, proponent cooperative associationshave competed with each other to set over-order service charges low enoughto maintain year-round sales of their members' milk to fluid handlers.He charged that cooperatives then use the ``call'' provision or minimumshipping requirement to force proprietary handlers to give up milk forfluid use at the time of year it is most profitable for handlers to keepmilk supplies in their own manufacturing plants.The TAPP representative characterized the proposal as contrary to the RegulatoryFlexibility Act which, he said, protects small businesses from the adverseeffects of government regulations. He stated that a minimum shipping percentagewould have a greater impact on a small proprietary plant's operations.Such a plant, he said, may not be equipped to get involved in selling milkfor fluid use. The witness described the operations of proponent cooperativeassociations as being more advantagous than those of small proprietaryhandlers in supplying the market for Class I use. He said that proponents'milk supplies are located close to the market; are largely direct-deliveredto distributing plants, resulting in lower handling costs; and are oftenpooled in multiple-plant operations, allowing more flexibility in handling.He cited the example of a small cheese plant operator who had decided todrop out of the pool during the fall months of 1986 when a ``call'' formilk supplies was announced, rather than ship the percentage required bythe ``call.'' In order to participate in the pool and be able to pay hisproducers the blend price during subsequent months, the witness said, thehandler had to incur the expense of shipping a percentage of his receiptsequivalent to the marketwide percentage of producer milk used in ClassI during the same month of the previous year, and thereby qualify as asupply plant.The witness for TAPP argued that distributing plants should pay whateverprice is needed to obtain an adequate supply of milk for Class I use withoutany minimum shipping standards or ``call'' provisions to require handlersto ship milk for fluid use. Without such regulatory forcing of shipments,he said, over-order service charges will rise to cover the cost of shippingmilk to distributing plants.The Upper Midwest milk order should require that all reserve supply plantsship at least a minimum percentage of their receipts of producer milk topool distributing plants. At the present time it is apparent that withouta ``call'' requiring shipments to fluid milk plants many handlers avoidsuch shipments altogether.A situation in which some reserve supply plant operators ship milk at levelswell above the marketwide percentage of producer milk used in Class I,and other reserve supply plant operators do not ship milk at all is equitableto none of the market participants. According to the record testimony,handlers who supply milk for fluid use incur significantly greater coststhan those who retain their milk supplies for manufacturing use. As a result,shipping handlers are disadvantaged with respect to their competitors,both in the cost of producing manufactured products and in their abilityto attract an adequate supply of producer milk. Because handlers that carrythe burden of supplying the fluid milk market have higher operating coststhan other handlers, their ability to pay producers as much as non-shippinghandlers pay is impaired, resulting in inequitable returns to producers.In addition, a distributing plant operator who must pay more than the customaryover-order service charges for some of the milk required to operate hisplant is placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other distributingplant operators who may be able to obtain adequate supplies at the customaryprice.In order to participate in the marketwide pool, and thus subsidize theirpayments to producers with the Federal order blend price, reserve supplyplant operators should demonstrate their willingness and ability to helpsupply milk for the higher-valued uses that generate the blend price. Testimonythat some reserve supply plants are not approved or equipped to ship milkto distributing plants indicates that some handlers participating in themarketwide pool may not be capable of supplying milk for fluid use, evenif they were willing. Although the cost of shipping Class I milk apparentlyexceeds the returns for such shipments, it would not be reasonable to allowhandlers and producers that have neither the ability nor any intentionto supply milk for Class I use to enjoy the benefits of participating inthe marketwide pool, since a basis purpose of the order is to assure anadequate supply of milk for fluid use.In addition to fostering equitable treatment under regulation, mandatoryshipping standards would dispel any doubts handlers may have about whetherthey will be required to ship milk to distributing plants or not. Also,minimum shipping requirements will encourage establishment of regular supplyrelationships between reserve supply plant operators and distributing plants.Opponents' arguments against adoption of minimum shipping percentages centeredon the idea of efficiency. It is inefficient to move milk long distancesfor fluid use when there are closer-in supplies of milk available. However,one of the more significant costs of supplying the fluid market, accordingto both proponents and opponents, is the opportunity cost of milk removedfrom a manufacturing plant operating at less than full capacity to be deliveredto a distributing plant. The ``give-up'' cost associated with shippingsuch milk falls as heavily on a handler located near Minneapolis/St. Paulas it does on a handler located in central North Dakota. The transportationcost of moving such milk, of course, would be greater for the North Dakotahandler.An additional argument by opponents was that minimum shipping requirementswould serve to reduce the already inadequate handling charges on shipmentsof Class I milk. However, opponents' data showed that handling chargeseffective in surrounding marketing areas, most of which are subject torequired shipping percentages, are generally higher than in the Upper Midwestarea. This data would seem to indicate that the presence of shipping requirementsin an order does not necessarily have the effect of discouraging over-orderhandling charges.The problem of handling and hauling milk in an efficient and economicalmanner while complying with minimum shipping requirements can best be solvedby allowing handlers to have the operations of their reserve supply plantsconsidered on a combined, or unit, basis for the purpose of meeting poolingstandards. Proponents initially proposed that a handler operating morethan one reserve supply plant be allowed to have the plants' pool qualificationsdetermined on a combined basis. Two of the proponents then testified thatthey would favor a provision allowing two or more cooperative associationsto have their reserve supply plant operations considered on a combinedbasis for determining pool qualifications. Two opponents of the proposaladvocated that if minimum shipping requirements are adopted, any groupof handlers should be allowed to have their reserve supply plants pooledon a ``unit'' basis in order to enhance their efficiency of handling andhauling milk.Allowing handlers to pool their reserve supply plants on a unit basis wouldcounteract most of the inefficiencies involved in requiring minimum shippingpercentages, and would decrease the cost of pooling for handlers that haveonly one plant or are distant from the center of the marketing area. Handlerswithin such a group may decide between themselves which plants should shipthe qualifying milk to distributing plants and which plants would not needto ship. The unit would qualify for pooling, then, on the basis of thepercentage of producer milk receipts at all of the plants in the unit thatis shipped to distributing plants. Although it is true, as one witnessclaimed, that savings in the operating costs of proprietary handlers arenot necessarily passed on to producers, it is clear from the hearing recordthat the procurement of producer milk supplies in the Upper Midwest marketingarea is extremely competitive. Under these circumstances, handlers thatwish to procure supplies of producer milk must be willing to pay theirproducers a price competitive with prices paid to cooperative member producers.It is most likely that the very competitive procurement situation in themarket will ensure that proprietary handlers pass savings in operationson to their producers.A request for unit status should be filed with the market administratorby July 15, when requests for pool status for individual reserve supplyplants are also due. These requests will assure that units formed for meetingshipping percentages are firmly established before each August throughDecember shipping period. The requests filed by the handlers who wish toform units should specify the order in which plants would be eliminatedfrom a unit if the unit fails to meet the minimum shipping percentagesrequired by the order. Because of the provisions allowing plants that havebeen pool plants during an August through December period to retain automaticpool status through the following months of January through July, it isimportant that the composition of a unit change as little as possible duringthe qualifying period, with the exception of a plant eliminated becausethe unit does not meet the pooling standard. Administrator of a provisionthat would allow handlers to add plants to a unit, as well as subtractthem, would prove to be cumbersome. Therefore, no plant should be ableto rejoin a unit after being eliminated for the unit's failure to qualify,and no plant should be permitted to join a unit after its initial formation.However, a plant which fails to meet the minimum shipping requirements,either singly or as part of a unit, may qualify for pooling as a reservesupply plant in any month thereafter during the August-December qualifyingperiod. Reserve supply plants that refuse to meet ``call'' requirements,on the other hand, should not be able to regain pool reserve supply plantstatus by any means until the following August. In either case, a plantlosing reserve supply plant status during any month of the qualifying periodmay qualify for pooling as a regular supply plant during the months ofJanuary through July by delivering to distributing plants a percentageof its receipts equivalent to the marketwide percentage of producer milkused in Class I during the same month of the previous year. Multi-planthandlers wishing to have their plants considered as a unit would be subjectto the same provisions as a group of handlers forming a unit. The requirement that a request be filed with the market administrator toform a unit for the purpose of qualifying reserve supply plants for poolingis adapted from the present order provisions and proponents' proposal.The Upper Midwest order currently requires that a handler file a requestfor the pool status of a reserve supply plant at least 15 days prior tothe first day of the month for which pool status is to begin. Proponents'proposal specifies that a reserve supply plant operator file such a requestby each July 15 in order to obtain pool status for the plant for the followingyear. Timely notification to the market administrator of a handler's intentionto qualify one or several reserve supply plants for pooling, or of theintention of a group of handlers to qualify a unit of reserve supply plantsfor pooling, will facilitate the effective administration of the order.The 5- and 8-percent levels of required shipping percentages proposed byproponents will assure that all reserve supply plant operators will beara significant and equitable share of the responsibility of supplying milkfor Class I use. At the same time, the proposed percentages are not highenough to generate excess shipments of milk to distributing plants. Accordingto the hearing record, shipments at the proposed percentages would nothave supplied adequate supplies of milk to the fluid market during thefall months of 1986. It is expected that negotiations between reserve supplyplant operators and distributing plant operators will be able to fill anygap between required and needed shipments. In any case, retention of the``call'' provision and incorporation of a provision allowing the Directorof the Dairy Division to temporarily reduce the required shipping percentageswill give the order flexibility in dealing with any fluctuations in supplyand demand. In addition to establishing minimum shipping percentages to assure thatreserve supply plants supply the fluid market on a more equitable basisthan in the past, and incorporating unit pooling for groups of reservesupply plant operators to facilitate efficiency in handling and hauling,it is also important to assure that each plant included in the marketwidepool is at least capable of delivering milk to distributing plants. Forthis reason, the order should include a requirement that each reserve supplyplant deliver at least 5 percent of its receipts to pool distributing plantsduring one month of the August-December qualifying period. Opponents argued that requiring any deliveries from small, poorly-locatedhandlers violates the Regulatory Flexibility Act by placing an unfair burdenon such handlers, and promotes inefficient and uneconomic handling. Theycited the example of several handlers who had opted not to meet the shippingpercentages required by the ``call'' for fluid milk supplies for the monthsof September, October and November 1986. As a result, opponents stated,the reserve supply plants operated by those handlers had been penalizedby their ineligibility to be pooled for the next full year after losingpool status. The level of shipping requirements adopted in this decision is neitherunfair nor a violation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The RegulatoryFlexibility Act requires that the impact of government regulation on smallbusinesses be considered and analyzed. The impact of requiring shipmentsfrom small handlers has been considered and found to be proportionate withthe regulatory burden on all other handlers. Requiring no performance atall from small handlers is unfair to all of the other handlers who do delivermilk to distributing plants. Participation in the pool is not compulsory.Handlers must make business decisions about such matters as the cost ofdelivering a minor percentage of their milk supplies to the fluid marketduring one month versus the benefit of participating in the pool for anumber of months without having to ship any milk for Class I use. If thecost of meeting the shipping requirements outweighs the benefit of sharingin the market's Class I use, then a handler is clearly better off not togive up that fraction of his milk supply. If, on the other hand, participationin the pool for a number of months is a greater benefit than the cost ofreleasing some milk to the fluid market for one month, meeting shippingrequirements will be in the handler's best interests. Allowing handlersto form units to meet the order's minimum shipping standards will helpto offset most of the inefficient or uneconomic handling practices promotedby the adoption of such standards. As proposed by proponents, the provision authorizing the market administratorto issue a ``call'' for supplies of milk for Class I use from reserve supplyplants should remain in the order. Although it is anticipated that thepercentage shipping standards adopted herein will result in an adequatesupply of milk for fluid use, with occasional need for negotiation, itis possible that additional milk may be required at some time during theyear. The ``call'' provisions proposed by proponents are identical to thosecurrently contained in the Upper Midwest order. Aside from an objectionto the existence of any requirements that milk be moved from reserve supplyplants to distributing plants, no modifications of the present ``call''provisions were proposed. Even so, one change should be made. The provisionthat precludes a plant from being pooled as a reserve supply plant fora full year after failing to comply with announced shipping requirementsshould be changed to prohibit such a plant from being pooled through thefollowing July. If failure to comply with a ``call'' occurred, for instance,during the month of October, the plant would not be eligible for poolingas a reserve supply plant until the following October. As a result, theplant not only could not be a pool reserve supply plant from the monthsof January through July immediately following its failure to comply, butwould also be ineligible for an additional January through July periodbecause of its failure to be pooled for the months of August and Septemberof the following year.In order to assure that excessive movements of Class I milk to distributingplants are not required of reserve supply plant operators, the Directorof the Dairy Division should have the discretion of reducing the minimumshipping percentages. This aspect of proponents' proposal would add neededflexibility to the requirement that reserve supply plants ship at leasta certain percentage of their receipts to distributing plants. If lessthan the required percentages of milk are needed to fulfill the market'sfluid needs, the objective of efficient marketing would be better servedby allowing the excess milk to remain in manufacturing plants. There isno need to include authorization for the Director to increase the requiredpercentages. If additional milk supplies are needed for Class I use, theability of the market administrator to issue a ``call'' for the neededmilk will expedite the shipment of such supplies. Proponents' proposal to reduce the requirement that a reserve supply planreceive a daily average of 25,000 pounds of milk per day to 25,000 poundson two consecutive days should be denied. As stated earlier, only thoseplants that actually are capable of supplying milk to the fluid marketshould be eligible for pooling as reserve supply plants. A plant that receivesonly 25,000 pounds of milk on two consecutive days of a month representsno real potential supply of milk to the fluid market. As stated by theNFO witness, the current requirement is minimal, and should be maintained.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions </ITAG>Briefs and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of certaininterested parties.
