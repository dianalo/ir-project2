It built mammoth, automated packing plants next to the Midwest's huge feed yards and packed beef in boxes. Low-paid workers replaced high-paid butchers and boxes of frozen beef cuts replaced &quot;swinging&quot; carcasses in butcher shops. Competitors followed or died.    Today, however, the $8 billion giant has become a laggard in the widespread move to create brand identity around beef. Other meatpackers, now giants themselves, have begun selling branded beef the way that Mars sells candy bars and Betty Crocker sells cake mixes. IBP, meanwhile, continues to dump boxes of unbranded beef on supermarkets, which wrap it up in cellophane and pocket the mark-up for themselves.    &quot;IBP was the leader for years and years,&quot; says Clem Ward, a beef marketing expert at Oklahoma State University. &quot;But in a few areas they've lost that leadership.&quot;    Cattlemen, worried that the big packer, which has about 22% of the beef market, is moving too slowly to keep poultry from cutting further into their market, wonder when IBP will get moving. &quot;We're standing on the sidelines expecting another wave of creativity and innovation,&quot; says Robert Campbell, president of Bartlett Cattle Co., a major feed-lot operator.    But so far, the creativity and innovation have come from other packers. Excel Corp., the meatpacking arm of agribusiness giant Cargill Inc., has introduced retail-ready cuts of beef carrying the Excel brand. Geo. A. Hormel andamp; Co. is selling a variety of meats that require no refrigeration. And Wilson Foods Corp. has developed a patented &quot;Tender-Cuts&quot; technology to produce a more tender pork chop that has a longer shelf life.    Branded beef, which offers higher margins and the chance to win consumer loyalty, is only one of the challenges facing IBP. Labor unions hassle the company, forcing government actions and congressional investigations. Communities resist the packer's plans to build plants in their towns. Scandals of the past dog the company and a cattle shortage is squeezing already-paper-thin margins.    All this comes as IBP faces the greatest financial hurdles of its 28-year history. At a time when other meatpackers are joining conglomerates with deep pockets -- Monfort and Swift have been gobbled up by ConAgra Inc. and Excel has been acquired by Cargill -- IBP is suddenly on its own hook. Six months ago, it was sold to the public by Occidental Petroleum Corp. and saddled with $400 million in long-term debt; that compares with $61 million in long-term debt in 1981 before Occidental bought it. Moreover, IBP is paying a hefty quarterly dividend that ate up 50% of its first-quarter earnings.    IBP's debt is an unfamiliar load for the company as it enters the retail market race. &quot;It's like someone who's been accustomed to running 5.5-minute miles. Now put a sand weight on their foot,&quot; says Kevin McCullough of CMCP Inc., a Boulder, Colo., meat industry consultant. &quot;They're not out of the race, but it brings them down to the world of mortals.&quot;    IBP acknowledges that it has fallen behind its competitors in trying to develop branded products for the consumer market. But in granting their first interviews in a decade, IBP executives suggest that what the company lacks in expertise, it more than makes up for in size. Robert L. Peterson, IBP's chairman, chief executive officer and president, points out that IBP wasn't the first to develop boxed beef either, but it still took over the market. Speaking with the confidence of a company that has crushed competitors before, Mr. Peterson says, &quot;We're not the leader in branded products. But if I get in there with a better product, I'm going to win.&quot;    While it is true that &quot;we're not highly intelligent marketing people,&quot; Mr. Peterson notes that that doesn't pose an insurmountable problem. &quot;We'll hire them,&quot; he says matter-of-factly. Mr. Peterson also hints that IBP might acquire its marketing expertise by buying a poultry company, a business that has been selling branded products for years. &quot;We may be in the poultry business before we're in the branded beef business,&quot; he says.    But to market consumer products requires major changes in corporate thinking. And that can't be accomplished by fiat. Ask Wilson Chairman Kenneth Griggy how difficult it is to make the marketing leap to branded products. &quot;It took years, not months&quot; for Wilson to develop the corporate culture that transformed the meatpacker from a hog butcher to a successful marketer and consumer-products company, he says.    Not that other beef packers have all made the transition to branded beef products with ease. Analysts say Excel's branded steaks aren't exactly selling like McDonald's hamburgers. Monfort's push into branded beef products has been stalled as ConAgra struggles to solve the operating problems of its newly absorbed packers, Monfort and Swift. And Wilson has faced headaches getting supermarkets geared up to stocking branded meat products.    Moreover, these innovations haven't added strength to packers' bottom line. Analysts expect many of these packers to show losses for the first quarter while IBP continues to make money.    For one thing, shipping out ready-to-buy meat products isn't as simple as it sounds. Among other things, it requires packaging know-how to maintain the meat's color and freshness; with current technology, beef turns purple and, as many meat-department managers have discovered, meat buyers turn red.    As a result, Mr. Peterson says that while IBP is beginning to develop branded beef products this year, it isn't about to rush to the market until it is satisfied with the products' shelf life, cost and convenience. While IBP is, as always, highly secretive about its plans, Mr. Peterson suggests that IBP is testing some branded, value-added products that are precooked and can be heated in a microwave. But he suggests that many improvements need to be made before the products are ready to market.    &quot;Adding value isn't wrapping cellophane around a piece of meat and sticking a gummed label on it,&quot; Mr. Peterson says, taking a swipe at his competitors' products.    But technology is just one obstacle confronting IBP in its efforts to market beef directly to the public. IBP must also overcome a tarnished image among consumers who remember widely publicized scandals involving the meatpacker: a bribery case involving payoffs to meat packing unions in New York City, purported ties to organized crime and a $2.9 million fine for record-keeping violations involving injuries at its plants.    IBP's image has already proved to be a significant problem in its efforts to build three big pork plants and a beef plant in the next three to five years. The packer has sought the blessing of rural communities where it wants to locate, but hasn't always found a welcome mat at the town door.    Indeed, every major candidate in Iowa's Democratic caucuses this year campaigned against the packer as a symbol of corporate greed. When IBP selected Manchester, Iowa, as the site for one of its new pork plants, residents went on the warpath. At a town meeting, opponents inspired fear of widespread water pollution, including visions of hog heads floating down the local river. Labor union officials warned that the plant would bring an influx of Southeast Asians, Hispanics and illegal immigrants to the small community.    IBP's highly publicized battles with labor also have hurt its community relations in some union strongholds. Long and violent strikes at IBP's Dakota City plant have become legendary. The United Food and Commerical Workers has targeted IBP's 11 nonunion plants for organizing drives. The union has lost about 5,000 members through strikes at other meatpacking plants in the area during the past two years. Only three IBP plants are unionized. Moreover, the Labor Department recently singled out IBP for failing to pay overtime to workers for the time it took them to outfit themselves with safety equipment and sharpen their butchery knives.    IBP is now taking a more conciliatory tone with labor, hoping to curry favor with communities that may one day be home to an IBP packing plant. For example, IBP chose the union stronghold of Waterloo, Iowa, which lost a big packer a few years ago, as a site for one of its new pork plants. IBP didn't even bother to ask for big tax breaks from the community. &quot;I think in a big labor town like this, they're trying to start off on the right foot,&quot; says a town official.    IBP is clearly trying to build bridges. &quot;We come from the side that people don't need unions because we'll treat them fair,&quot; says Mr. Peterson. &quot;But to say all employers will treat employees fair, I don't believe that.&quot;    ---               Iowa Beef: A Financial Profile                           1983   1984   1985   1986   1987    Sales (in billions)   $6.1   $6.6   $6.5   $6.8   $7.6    Net earnings     (in millions)        $40.6  $50.3  $50.5  $66.8  $67.9    Working capital     (in millions)        $157.9 $185.4 $237.8 $278.3 $210.4    Assets (in billions)  $1.03  $1.06  $1.14  $1.22  $1.25    Long-term debt     (in millions)        $38.3  $32.1  $26.6  $26.9  $416.9    Shareholders equity     (in millions)        $735.9 $788.5 $840.9 $909.8 $458.9</TEXT></DOC>
