But while analysts say that the September quarter will bedreadful for computer earnings, they add that a strongereconomy, combined with the raft of new computer models dueout in coming months, could lift fortunes. &quot;We expect fairlydismal earnings universally,&quot; says Bruce Lupatkin, an analystat Hambrecht andamp; Quist. &quot;But the September quarter will proveto be the bottom of what has been a difficult period.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Even the high-flyers of earlier quarters this year arehurting a bit, analysts say. Personal-computer makers DellComputer Corp. and AST Research Inc. sailed through early1991 with enviable growth, gaining market share fromcompanies such as Compaq Computer Corp. and InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. as business users increasingly turnedaway from Compaq and IBM's premium-priced machines.   But analysts say sales and earnings at Dell and AST, whileup from year-ago levels, will be flat when compared with theprior quarter. Analyst Steven Ossad of Montgomery Securities,expects Dell to report net income of $12.4 million, or 50cents a share, for the quarter ending Oct. 31, up from $6.9million, or 34 cents a share, a year ago, but equal to theprior quarter's results. AST reported net of $16.5 million,or 52 cents a share, for the quarter ended Sept. 27, up from11.4 million, or 37 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter,but down 19% from from the prior quarter. &quot;Their momentum hasdefinitely slowed,&quot; says Mr. Ossad.   The same goes for the workstation makers such as SunMicrosystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc., both of MountainView, Calif., says analyst Peter Rogers of Robertson,Stephens andamp; Co. &quot;The recession seems to be catching up evenwith the well-positioned vendors,&quot; he says.   Mr. Rogers estimates that Silicon Graphics' net for theSeptember quarter was $6 million, down from $9.6 million lastyear. And investors are increasingly bearish on Sun, whoseearnings growth mocked the recession earlier this year, hesays. &quot;Investors are steeled for 20 to 30 cents a share,&quot;versus 26 cents last year, Mr. Rogers says, &quot;but who knowswhere it will come out.&quot;   Still, those returns will be the envy of bigger rivals.Compaq's sales were hit in the quarter when some of itsbiggest distributors acquired each other and cut back PCpurchases when they found themselves with excess inventories.Analyst Daniel Benton of Goldman Sachs expects Compaq toreport net income of $14 million, or 16 cents a share, forthe quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $123.6 million, or$1.38 a share, a year ago.   Apple Computer Inc., despite growing demand for itsmachines, took a profit hit because the machines it isselling carry lower profit margins. The Cupertino, Calif.,company sold 50% to 60% more machines in the quarter endedSept. 27 than in the year-ago quarter, but revenue only grewto $1.51 billion from $1.35 billion because increasing salesof low-end machines pushed margins down. Apple yesterdayreported net income of $81.2 million, or 67 cents a share,compared with $98.5 million, or 81 cents a share, last year.   International Business Machines and most other purveyorsof &quot;big iron,&quot; the mainframes that were the mainstay ofcomputer rooms of the past, have recently suffered ascustomers move to workstations and other smaller machines fornew computing tasks. Add the recession's effect on capitalpurchases, and the fact that IBM and several other makers ofbig machines are between computer models, and the earningspicture gets worse. IBM, Armonk, N.Y., reported that netincome fell 85% to $172 million, or 30 cents a share, from$1.1 billion, or $1.95 a share, last year.   Amdahl Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif., which specializes inmainframes that are compatible with IBM's, will reportearnings of about three cents a share in the quarter endedSept. 30, compared with 42 cents a share last year, estimatesJay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds. He expects net income atTandem Computers Inc., Cupertino, Calif., which servesfinancial industries with fault-tolerant machines, to fall to14 cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 30 centslast year. Earnings at Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard,Mass., rose to $28.6 million, or 23 cents a share, from $26.2million, or 21 cents a share.   One bright spot: Stratus Computer Inc., Marlboro, Mass.,will report earnings of 53 cents a share versus 47 cents lastyear, Mr. Stevens estimates. Stratus, which makesfault-tolerant machines that are less expensive thanTandem's, has benefited in the recession from very tightcontrols and a lower-priced machine that tends to catch theeye of corporate procurement officials with shrinkingbudgets, he says.   Despite the doom and gloom, many analysts expect earningsto get better, if not late this year then early in 1992. Newclasses of high-performance workstations, notebook PCs andsoftware applications should spur sales, they say. Of course,they caution, the economy must spring back first.</TEXT></DOC>
