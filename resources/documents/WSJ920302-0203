The company hasacknowledged that its unit engaged in practices it's &quot;notproud of,&quot; but denied paying bounty hunter fees orinvolvement in other illegal activities.   Company spokesman David Olson acknowledged that thepsychiatric business -- which makes up almost 30% of companyrevenue -- has plummeted 30% to 40% in Texas in the pastyear, and 20% to 30% in New Jersey and Florida.   &quot;I don't know if this issue is behind them,&quot; said JohnHindelong, a health care analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette. Mr. Hindelong expects National Medical to downsizesignificantly its psychiatric division, shutting down orconverting into rehabilitation centers as many as six of its88 psychiatric hospitals. Mr. Olson declined to commentdirectly but said that business hit a low mark inmid-December and has recovered slightly since then.   In addition, last week the Texas Department of MentalHealth and Mental Retardation threatened to shut down thechain's Fort Worth psychiatric hospital after issuing astinging 10-page indictment of practices there. It gave thehospital 30 days to make changes or have its license pulled.</TEXT></DOC>
