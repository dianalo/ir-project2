It was the first defeat for the tobacco industry in three decades of court battles over liability for smokers' deaths.    The six-person jury in Newark, N.J., also held that Durham, N.C.-based Liggett was aware of the dangers of smoking and should have warned Rose Cipollone and other customers before 1966, when Congress started requiring tobacco companies to put warnings on cigarette packages. Mrs. Cipollone, a life-long smoker, died in 1984.    However, in one of the most crucial parts of the closely watched case, the jury found that Liggett and the other defendants -- the Philip Morris Inc. unit of Philip Morris Cos. and the Lorillard Inc. unit of Loews Corp., both based in New York -- didn't conspire to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking before 1966.    Attorneys for the tobacco companies called the jury's findings a victory. But others said the outcome was at the least a major symbolic blow to the industry. Tobacco companies have never before had even a partial defeat in the more than 300 tobacco liability cases that have been tried, nor have they ever settled a case out of court.    &quot;It's certainly a 'shot heard 'round the world,'&quot; said David A. Goldman, an analyst at Fahnestock andamp; Co., New York.    &quot;It is a watershed, the breakthrough,&quot; said John Banzhaf, executive director of the anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and Health.    According to Cynthia Walters, an attorney for plaintiff Antonio Cipollone, the case marks the first time a jury has found that a smoker's death was at least partly due to smoking. In previous cases, tobacco companies have typically won by arguing that there's no proof cigarettes cause lung cancer and that even if they do, they didn't cause the particular death at issue in the trial.    The Cipollone decision means the tobacco industry &quot;can't continue to pull the wool over the public's eyes on causation,&quot; Ms. Walters said.    The direct financial impact on the industry isn't expected to be large. Even a flood of new lawsuits -- which Ms. Walters doesn't expect -- and damage awards would add only a few cents to the price of a pack of cigarettes, analysts estimate. That's partly because the industry generally is considered vulnerable only to claims involving its conduct before 1966.    Moreover, future damage awards aren't expected to be large. Marc Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., New York, says that in contrast to claims involving asbestos exposure -- where the dangers generally weren't known by the victims -- even persons who smoked before 1966 will have a hard time convincing juries they didn't know smoking was dangerous.    But the Cipollone decision &quot;certainly will have an impact on the (tobacco) industry's political base of support,&quot; said Calvert Crary, a liability specialist at Martin Simpson andamp; Co., a New York brokerage concern. The case, he said, could lead to more stringent regulation of cigarette distribution and consumption. &quot;That is the big consequence of this case,&quot; Mr. Crary said.    Analysts were divided on the possible impact on tobacco-company stocks. Kurt Feuerman at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had been predicting that a loss in court would produce an immediate drop of 10% or more in the stocks' prices; but yesterday he said he expects a smaller decline than that because of the limited nature and size of the jury award. Others said a defeat already has been factored into the price of tobacco stocks.    But Mr. Goldman of Fahnestock said he expects a significant decline. &quot;The $400,000 is laughable in terms of financial impact, but this means a further loss of investor confidence,&quot; he said.    The jury awarded the $400,000 to Mr. Cipollone after finding that Liggett breached an &quot;express warranty&quot; in its pre-1966 advertising that its cigarettes were safe. For example, in the 1950s, it promoted its Landamp;M brand, which Mrs. Cipollone smoked, as &quot;just what the doctor ordered.&quot;    Although trial testimony indicated that Mrs. Cipollone knew smoking was dangerous, Marc Edell, the lead plaintiff's attorney, argued that such advertising gave her a conflicting message.    The jurors also held that Liggett failed to warn Mrs. Cipollone of the dangers of smoking before 1966. But they found she bore 80% of the blame for her death, despite Mr. Edell's efforts to persuade them that she was addicted to smoking and couldn't quit.    As a result, Liggett wasn't found liable for damages on the failure-to-warn claim. The damage award on the warranty issue didn't involve an assessment of Mrs. Cipollone's conduct.    Defense attorneys argued that Mrs. Cipollone was a well-informed, intelligent woman who was aware of the risks and smoked because she enjoyed it.    The fraud and conspiracy charges were unique to the Cipollone case and were what made the four-month trial the subject of national attention. For the first time, cigarette makers were forced to disclose thousands of pages of confidential documents that suggested, according to the plaintiff's attorneys, that the companies knew smoking is linked to cancer and other diseases.    The evidence suggested, they said, that manufacturers sought to suppress research data on smoking and health and to undercut scientific findings by generating controversy in the press and the medical community over the causes of lung cancer.    The jury's finding that there was no conspiracy was hailed by defense attorneys as the key decision in the case.    &quot;We think it's a victory,&quot; said Alan Naar, an attorney for Liggett. &quot;The major claims -- fraud, misrepresentation and conspiracy -- that were presented to the jury . . . were completely rejected by the jury.&quot; Mr. Naar said Liggett will appeal the &quot;express warranty&quot; ruling and is confident it will be overturned.    Peter Bleakley, a lawyer for Philip Morris, termed the jury decision a 95% victory for the tobacco industry. Charles Wall, an attorney with the Kansas City, Mo., law firm Shook, Hardy andamp; Bacon, which represents Lorillard and Philip Morris, said: &quot;I think the verdict should offer little comfort to the plaintiff's lawyers. The case took five years' preparation . . . and $400,000 hardly offers much appeal or much hope to plaintiffs' lawyers or to plaintiffs.&quot;    But Mr. Crary at Martin Simpson said the relatively small award may work to the plaintiff's advantage. &quot;It's harder to reverse a $400,000 personal-injury verdict than a $10 million one,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
