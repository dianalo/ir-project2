Image restoration can also reduce the high-frequency noisein the image. This study applies constrained least-squares (CLS) restorationto the projection images of single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT). In a previous study, it was noted that CLS restoration has thepotential advantage of automatically adapting to the blurred object.This potential is confirmed using planar images. CLS restoration is thenmodified to improve its performance when applied to SPECT projectionimage sets. The modification was necessary because the Poisson noisein low count SPECT images causes considerable variation in the CLS filter.On phantom studies, count-dependent Metz restoration was slightly betterthan the modified CLS restoration method, according to measures of contrastand noise. However, CLS restoration was generally judged as yieldingthe best results when applied to clinical studies, apparently becauseof its ability to adapt to the image being restored.</TEXT></DOC>
