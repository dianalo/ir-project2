Fundamentalconsiderations of the phase behavior of carbon dioxide indicate thatthe safe and trouble-free operation of a well injecting acid into a carbonateformation is predicated upon one primary condition: that the producedcarbon dioxide be in the liquid, not gaseous, state. This condition willbe easily met in deep wells; but only if the effective temperature ofthe acid is below 88{sup 0}F, the critical temperature of carbon dioxide.In the final analysis, the immediate threat to the environment from suchacid disposal is from well blowouts resulting from acid injection attemperatures above 88{sup 0}F. The key to the operational safety of suchwells, thus appears to be the cooling of the injected acid substantiallybelow 88{sup 0}F. The validity of these theoretical considerations isillustrated by the documented operational history as well as the circumstancesleading to the blowout of an example well in the Great Lakes region.</TEXT></DOC>
