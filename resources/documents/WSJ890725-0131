Gas decontrol has been a long time coming, lagging far behind President Reagan's crude-oil price decontrol of 1981. But better late than never.    What is truly remarkable about gas decontrol is that, in the end, there was little political dispute over the principle of freemarket pricing. All of the major segments of an industry that once fought tooth and nail for regulatory advantage suddenly seemed to have experienced a miraculous conversion to a concept something like this: &quot;Hey. In a market system, resources will be managed more efficiently and everyone will gain. Why didn't we think of this before?&quot;    The American Gas Association, mainly representing local utilities, seems delighted, even though many distributors once thought they needed federal protection against producer market power. Says George H. Lawrence, president of the AGA: &quot;In this modern natural-gas industry, for the first time in its history, we're without any federal controls or intrusions on the supply or demand side of our business and we think it's going to be fine.&quot;    No doubt it will be, not only for the industry but also for the economy, which hasn't had any significant deregulatory boost for several years now. No one seems to doubt anymore that this big industry, serving business and some 50 million American homes, now will be able to make more efficient use of its huge capital infrastructure of wells, pipelines and gas mains, with benefits to the total economy.    Mr. Lawrence recalls the checkered history of gas controls: &quot;We came out of World War II with a big surplus of natural gas and as we began to build the pipelines to do something with it we ended up with a Supreme Court decision that put on price controls. It took awhile for that to work a shortage in the interstate market but it did. Then we began the phased removal of those controls in 1978. But meantime they put controls on the demand side with the fuel use act. Then we got rid of that, and now the final curtain is going to drop on the rest of controls. So really it's sort of a landmark period.&quot;    Maybe it required regulatory excess to make the point. The Supreme Court decision Mr. Lawrence refers to was a gem of judicial activism, the 1954 Phillips Petroleum v. Wisconsin. The court ruled that the Federal Power Commission was required by law to fix wellhead prices. Wisconsin's argument was simple: It didn't want to pay what Phillips wanted to charge. But the FPC never could quite figure out how to set the price of gas, so it just responded to political pressures and tried to keep the price low. Supply shortages resulted, shifting demand to oil. When oil, too, was put under controls in 1971, the country was on its way to an energy &quot;shortage,&quot; which ultimately manifested itself in soaring prices, gasoline lines, rationing and cold furnaces.    Even then some politicians chose to blame not controls, but Mother Nature. We were simply &quot;running out&quot; of fuel, they wailed. It wasn't until oil was decontrolled that this myth was dispelled. Oil-product prices went down as the market quickly sorted itself out. Gas decontrol took more time because there still were politicians locked into the fuddled notion that had motivated the Wisconsin attorney general and the Supreme Court in 1954 -- that natural gas was a &quot;monopoly&quot; industry that needed a price cop. More to the point, decontrol would have some losers, such as producers who had invested in expensive deep wells, so the politics of that had to be managed.    In the final analysis, natural-gas regulation collapsed of its own weight. Amid all the energy silliness of the 1970s, Congress passed the 1978 Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, dictating who could have natural gas and who couldn't. Homeowners could have it but the act barred the use of both oil and gas for fueling new electrical power plants. One result was to reduce throughputs in natural-gas pipelines, thus raising the unit cost of each cubic yard of gas moved and boosting the gas bills of homeowners. This act, coupled with a &quot;tier&quot; system for pricing gas based on its origins, ultimately turned into a regulatory farce. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, successor to the FPC, began dismantling this elaborate structure in the mid-1980s and the fuel use act was repealed outright two years ago.    FERC's administrative deregulation deserves much of the credit for this week's denouement, simply because it finally convinced all the players that they were better off in a deregulated environment. It became increasingly possible for local utilities and industrial customers to shop for gas, signing contracts with producers offering the best deals and thereby generating competition among producers. Pipelines lost their grip on the market and have been forced by market pressures to become carriers for gas purchased independently from producers. Even local distributors are offering their lines to bring gas to industrial customers who have made direct contracts.    More intense &quot;gas-to-gas&quot; competition, not to mention continued pressure from alternative fuels, has pushed prices down. Despite inflation, consumers are paying less for natural gas now, on average, than in 1984. All of which makes gas a strong competitor against other energy sources. President Bush's new environmental push could give gas a further boost, perhaps expanding the limited market as a fuel for buses, trucks and cars.    Why do prices go down under decontrol? Simply because the biggest cost of natural gas at the burner tip is the $100 billion capital infrastructure needed to get it there. If that infrastructure is used inefficiently, the price goes up. If producers, transporters and distributors are free to seek the most efficient ways of buying and selling gas, competition and improved efficiency will push the price down. All this may sound elementary after a decade of economic benefits from a broad range of decontrol measures -- in energy, transportation and communications -- but the learning process was long and tedious.    &quot;The more throughputs you get through the facility, the less it's going to cost the consumer because of the spreading of the fixed costs,&quot; says Eugene A. Tracy, chairman of Peoples Energy Corp. of Chicago. &quot;To the extent that you have increased ability to sell gas, with a supply situation where we have some confidence, you become more efficient. When they built the Sears building, we couldn't even talk to the Sears people about gas. It was prohibited for us to sell that quantity of gas under the regulations. What we have now is an opportunity to market in those areas.&quot;    No one worries much about &quot;running out&quot; anymore. The AGA notes that decontrol already has brought forth supplies from low-cost sources, such as methane deposits in coal seams that once were regarded mainly as a mining hazard. In a decontrolled market, price regulates usage. If natural shortages ever should develop, the price will rise and consumers will start to switch to alternative fuels. But that day is still a very long way off. It can be hoped that it will be a long time too before the country repeats its costly 35-year experiment with gas controls. </TEXT></DOC>
