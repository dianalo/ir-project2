Fox, who played Alex P. Keaton, the politically conservativeoldest child.   ``I think it's going to hit us around September when we would becoming back to work _ the same as a retired athlete would say whenthe football season starts next year and I'm not in springtraining,'' Fox said Sunday night at a party celebrating the NBC-TVshow.   In the final, one-hour episode to be broadcast May 14, Alexfulfills his longtime dream of landing a job with a Wall Streetbrokerage firm and prepares to leave home.   ``I will miss the entity of `Family Ties,''' said JustineBateman, who played Mallory Keaton, Alex's sister whose maininterests were fashion and shopping. ``It was an incrediblechemical combination and reaction. I don't think anyone remembersthe recipe. Actually, the recipe was hard work, good work and justclass and nice dispositions.''   The show, which debuted in September 1982, featured MichaelGross as their father, Steven Keaton, and Meredith Baxter Birney ashis wife, Elyse.   The parents, former flower children of the 1960s, confronted thematerialistic nature of Alex and Mallory, and younger daughterJennifer's struggle to grow up.   Jennifer, played by Tina Yothers, lost her role as baby of thefamily in the fifth season when son Andrew, played by BrianBonsall, was born.   While there was comedy, the show also tackled serious subjectssuch as teen-age pregnancy, death and divorce.   The series, which often ranked among the highest rated shows,won three Emmy Awards for the 1986-87 season, including Fox asoutstanding lead actor in a comedy series. An award for outstandingwriting in a comedy series went to creator Gary David Goldberg andco-executive producer Alan Uger for a special one-hour show, ``A,My Name is Alex,'' in which Alex struggled to cope with a friend'saccidental death.   Gross said he will miss his character as well as the castmembers.   ``I've enjoyed Steven. It's been fun living with him,'' he said,``and I hope I've even learned a few things from him _ patience andunderstanding and all those other things I have in a rather shortersupply than he does. But I'm going to miss my co-workers.''</TEXT></DOC>
