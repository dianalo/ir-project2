Spinning off the utility would allow Primark to focus on its unregulated communications, leasing, insurance and information-service businesses. Primark said in McLean, Va., that the IRS held the spin-off wouldn't be taxable either to Primark or to its shareholders.    Primark's holders will vote on the plan at the annual meeting May 12.    MichCon, which has annual revenue of about $1.4 billion, represents about 90% of Primark's total assets. In composite trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Primark closed at $21.50 a share, down 75 cents. Based on that price, the spin-off would have an indicated market value of about $385 million. </TEXT></DOC>
