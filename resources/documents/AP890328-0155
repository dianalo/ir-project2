Montazeri and two high Foreign Ministry officials appeared to bethe first government casualties in a fierce drive by Khomeini toreturn Iran to the roots of its fundamentalist revolution.   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Jaafar Mahallati, also resignedTuesday, two days after Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad JavadLarijani stepped down. Both are U.S.-educated.   Khomeini last month harshly attacked those who would rebuildlinks with the West and denounced lagging revolutionary fervor.   Montazeri's resignation came after Khomeini sent him a letter onMarch 26 asking him to step down, reported Iran's official Tehranradio, monitored in Nicosia.   ``I see myself compelled to obey your orders, because thesurvival and stability of the Islamic Republic rests on obeyingyour command,'' the radio quoted the 64-year-old Montazeri assaying.   The Mujahedeen Khalq, Iran's main opposition group, commented ina telex to The Associated Press from its Baghdad, Iraq,headquarters: ``A wave of dismissals and resignations ... atvarious levels is on the rise. ... The disposal of Montazeriindicates an eruption at the highest level of the unending internalconflicts. ''   The immediate cause of Montazeri's ouster appears to be hiscritical assessment of the revolution's accomplishments.   In a speech published Feb. 12 by the official Islamic RepublicNews Agency, Montazeri declared that Iranian leaders made manymistakes in the first 10 years of the revolution which isolated thefledgling republic from much of the world. His remarks drew astinging rejoinder from Khomeini.   Montazeri was chosen by an 83-member Council of Experts asKhomeini's successor in 1985. The ad hoc assembly itself had beenelected in 1982 to ensure succession in case of Khomeini's death.   Montazeri, an close ally of Khomeini since they organized anuprising against the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1963, waschosen after Khomeini hinted his support. On Tuesday he said healways opposed the move and that he simply wanted to return tobeing a religious student.   No immediate word surfaced on another Khomeini successor.   Khomeini had assailed Montazeri, without mentioning Montazeri'sname, after the Feb. 12 speech. ``How short-sighted are those whothink that because we did not reach final victory at the front,that martyrdom and self-sacrifice are worthless,'' he said.   Immediately after the cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq warlast August, Khomeini apparently gave free rein to the pragmatists.Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister AliAkbar Velayati, seeking loans and technology to rebuild Iran,spearheaded a drive to soften Iran's radical image.   Mahallati and Larijani were instrumental in rebuildingdiplomatic ties with the West. The ties had been strained since theradical outbursts of the first days of the 1979 revolution. Iransaw the West then as backing the ousted shah. It violently purgedinternal opposition and held 52 Americans hostage in the U.S.Embassy for 444 days.   By last week, Khomeini was proclaiming that Iran had driftedaway from the values of the revolution.   He warned pragmatists that ``the government must do its verybest to govern the people as best it can, but this does not meanthat it should drive them away from the great goals of therevolution, which is the creation of a global Islamic government.''   Khomeini first fired up the resurgence of the fundamentalistcamp by condemning Salman Rushdie to death for the British author'snovel ``The Satanic Verses,'' saying the book was blasphemous andproof of the West's attempt to undermine Islam.   When 14 Western nations withdrew their top diplomats to protestthe death sentence, Khomeini said it was proof of the futility ofnormalizing relations, and Parliament voted to sever ties withBritain.   In his letter, the radio said, Khomeini told Montazeri, ``Inorder that former mistakes may not be repeated, I advise you tocleanse your household from unsuitable individuals and seriouslyprevent the comings and goings of the opponents of the system whopretend to be in favor of Islam and the Islamic republic.''   Montazeri has had close contacts in recent months withopposition groups such as the tiny Freedom Movement of MehdiBazargan. Bazargan, Iran's first prime minister, now is thegovernment's most outspoken critic inside Iran.   In advising Montazeri to distance himself from the so-calledliberals, Khomeini wrote, ``I also gave you the same advice in thecase of Mehdi Hashemi.''   Montazeri has been at odds with the government since December1986, when Hashemi, son-in-law of Montazeri's brother, exposed thegovernment's clandestine contacts with the United States in thearms-for-hostages deal.   Hashemi was tried for treason, terrorism and kidnapping, and wasexecuted by firing squad on Sept. 22, 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
