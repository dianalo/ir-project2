(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal government's lawsuit alleging NewJersey police examinations were discriminatory could result in jobswith back pay and seniority for thousands of blacks, Hispanics andwomen who failed the tests.   The lawsuit against New Jersey announced Friday by the JusticeDepartment could lead to personnel changes in hundreds of localpolice departments and cost the state millions of dollars.   It followed months of negotiations between the Justice Departmentand the state personnel department, which designed and administeredthe test. The Justice Department filed the lawsuit Wednesday aftertalks broke down, agency spokesman Mark Weaver said in Washington.   ``We realize there could be a substantial cost to the state, butthat's the price you pay when you discriminate,'' Weaver said.``These people need to be held accountable.''   ``The Justice Department is running true to form in discussingthings with the press before they let the principals know,'' saidEugene McCaffrey Jr., the state commissioner of personnel whooversees New Jersey civil service positions. ``It's a non-biased,valid test.'' McCaffrey was named in the lawsuit.   According to the action, federal officials have sought to changethe test because it discriminates against blacks, Hispanics andwomen. The three groups have failed at a higher rate than whitemales, the lawsuit said.   Parts of the physical and written test have no bearing onmeasuring qualifications to be a police officer, the action alleged.   Weaver declined to provide statistics to support the claims, andwould not cite specific examples from the test because of thepending litigation.   The state's police examination is used to select candidates forappointment to entry-level police positions by the state and morethan 250 municipalities.   Deputy Personnel Commissioner Robert J. Hartman, the formerdirector of examinations for the department, denied the test isdiscriminatory but said state officials have been working with theJustice Department to change it. He said the lawsuit surprised himbecause he thought negotiations were going smoothly.   ``If there's any way I could accept anything they have to offer,without lowering our standards, I'd grab it,'' Hartman said. ``But Icouldn't afford to just go out and sign the first consent order theygave me. That's why we've been negotiating.''   He said the stumbling blocks to a settlement included the JusticeDepartment's insistence on invalidating all examinations since 1984.Hartman suggested that would hurt minority group members who alreadyare on lists of those who have passed the test, since policedepartments hire from those lists.   The examination has remained largely the same for about fiveyears, and 5,000 to 6,000 people have taken it each year, Hartmansaid. About half that number failed.   The Justice Department is pressing for reinstatement of peoplewho would have been hired had they passed the test since 1984, withfull back pay and seniority.   Settlement cost could run into millions of dollars, mostly paidby local police departments, Hartman said.   ``I don't think for a minute this thing's ever going to get totrial. We're too close,'' he said. ``But we're going to have bigproblems if it does go and we lose.''</TEXT></DOC>
