Poulson </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Failures of federal budget policy in the past decade have tended to obscure the success that state and local governments have achieved in putting their fiscal houses in order; the constraints that have proved effective at the state and local levels can be effective in solving federal fiscal problems as well.    Over the past 10 years, state and local government spending as a share of gross national product has declined, while federal spending's share has increased. The first thing to note about this divergence is that it is a relatively recent phenomenon. In the postwar decades up to the tax revolt of the late 1970s, state and local expenditures were increasing faster than federal expenditures.    The current prudence in state fiscal policies is projected to continue in coming years. In real terms, state appropriations for general-fund expenditures are projected to increase only slightly in 1988 and 1989. Balancing the budget continues to be the top fiscal issue in many states in this year. In those states facing deficits, such as Colorado, major cuts in the budget are being made. For the 1988 budget, 24 states have been compelled to so act.    However, some forms of public spending are likely to increase at the state and local levels -- primarily investment in human and physical capital. Because of prudence exercised for the past decade, governments closer to home are better poised to engage in a new round of such undertakings than is Washington. By contrast, income-transfer programs, which now constitute a large fraction of federal spending, are not due for major increases among the states and locally.    Not that any new programs will come easily: Education funding, the major part of most state budgets, may even be cut back in a number of states and held down in others, a survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures finds. Even in states such as Georgia, committed to upgrading schools, significant steps will be left unfunded. But overall, this area of activity stands to gain.    Growth of state and local spending and taxation is limited by a variety of means, even more so since the 1970s. In addition to balanced-budget provisions and debt limitations contained in their original constitutions, 20 states have adopted further strictures. These limits may be absolute, such as the 7% annual cap on the rise in spending in Colorado; or they may tie growth in government to personal income or population, and to the rate of increase of the price level.    Because of the way they were constructed, many of these measures weren't felt until economic recovery from the recession of 1982 had some treasuries bulging again. Now that has happened in such places as California and Massachusetts, and some legislators have called for repeal of the spending limits, but so far those appeals have been unsuccessful.    The effectiveness of state limits on taxes and spending depends on how stringently they are designed and enforced. Some states, such as California, require a supermajority vote in order to pass a tax increase, while other states require only a simple majority. Some states require the governor and the legislature to achieve a balanced budget that precludes any deficit or accumulation of debt, while other states require only that a balanced budget be submitted and allow deficits to be incurred in the actual spending for any given year.    In virtually all of the states one finds evidence of circumvention of fiscal constraints through such ploys as shifting expenditures off budget and borrowing from trust funds. During the past year the Missouri Legislature enacted tax changes that will cause revenues to exceed their limit. It is not clear how the courts will treat such violations. What is clear is that limits that are constitutionally defined are more likely to be enforced than are statutory limits.    Of course, the line-item veto in force in more than 40 states has provided the executive with considerable disciplining authority on the margin.    Fiscal restraint at the state and local levels reflects a growing competition among the states to design policies conducive to economic growth. A wealth of evidence indicates that failure to limit the size of government is a negative factor in this regard. Massachusetts probably is the most noted example of the converse. State and local expenditures there reached 20.56% of personal income in 1978, declining to 16.49% by 1985. During the same period, that spending in Massachusetts as a percentage of the national average fell to 90.2% from 105.8%. This corresponded with a boom in the state. Likewise, New York City, virtually bankrupted by imprudent fiscal policies in the mid-1970s, experienced rapid recovery in the past decade after pursuing more conservative fiscal policies.    Interstate tax competition to attract industry and jobs has accelerated with the federal tax reform of 1986. Reductions in the federal marginal income-tax rate have heightened sensitivity to the marginal rates in different states and localities. For high-income individuals, a reduction in the federal marginal tax rate from 50% to 28% means that every dollar they pay in state and local taxes now costs 72 cents rather than 50 cents. (Moreover, sales tax now isn't deductible at all.) Mobile labor and capital resources are attracted to states where they can earn the highest real return, and state and local taxes now have a greater impact on that real return than at any time in the past.    During the past year, 11 states reduced their top marginal rate and 10 states decreased the number of tax brackets. Further, 16 states raised personal exemptions and 17 states increased standard deductions.    Despite the budgetary constraints that will be encountered during the coming year, only two states, Illinois and Washington, have indicated that they will raise taxes to balance their budgets. On the other hand, six states are studying reforms in local tax systems, primarily to offer tax relief to property owners.    Although the revolutionary changes in taxing policies that we've seen over the past decade at the state level have been matched and sometimes initiated by action in Washington, the spending side of the federal ledger hasn't reflected the reality so apparent at other levels. However, with stock markets now apparently signaling that the game is up, the fiscal experience of the prudent for these past 10 years may be a model for the profligate.    ---   Mr. Poulson is an economics professor at the University of Colorado.    ---                     State Expenditures             Real annual general fund increases           GROWTH                FISCAL    FISCAL    FISCAL           RATE                  1987*     1988**    1989**           Less than 0%          17        17          9           0-5%                  20        24          6           5-10%                 11         9          1           Over                   2         0          0           Average growth rate   2.6%      1.1%        1.2%   *Estimated   **Approved   Source: National Association of State Budget Officers</TEXT></DOC>
