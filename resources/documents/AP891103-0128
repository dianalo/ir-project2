(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michigan voters will give their verdictTuesday on almost three years of work by state lawmakers to revampschool funding, and many experts fear they'll give the effort an``F.''   The voters will face two ballot proposals, each raising thestate sales tax to provide more money for schools. One alsoprovides some property tax relief and does more to equalize fundingamong school districts.   But many observers believe the combination of a proposed taxincrease, a complex issue, the expected low voter turnout, andpublic skepticism of the politicians who put the issues on theballot will be hard to overcome.   ``There is indeed a lot of cynicism, at least about anythingthat involves spending money and increasing taxes to spend money.It's not impossible, but any tax increase has a tough row to hoe,''said David Rohde, a political science professor at Michigan StateUniversity.   ``Nobody wants to pay more taxes. Everybody would like theschools to be better. It's really a question of the balance betweenwhat nearly everybody would say is two desirable ends.''   Two proposals on the ballot will increase the chances that onewill pass, Rohde says. Others maintain the two work against eachother, dividing the support of those who back the basic idea ofraising money for schools.   Opponents _ led by the influential Michigan State Chamber ofCommerce _ are reminding voters they don't have to choose betweenthe proposals but can vote against both.   ``The further we get away from the Capitol, the better thereception,'' said chamber vice president Richard Studley.   If both were to pass, the one with the most votes would takeeffect.   If both are defeated, few believe the Legislature wouldimmediately tackle the issue again but citizens groups might startpetition drives.   Treasurer Robert Bowman said if both proposals fail, Gov. JamesBlanchard would push school quality legislation and then propertytax relief, trying to limit assessment increases.   Legislation already has been introduced to sharply cut thenumber of school districts in an attempt to equalize their wealth.The state has 524 kindergarten-through-12th grade districts.   Proposal A on Tuesday's ballot would raise the state sales taxto 4.5 percent from 4 percent and generate about $400 million morefor schools.   Proposal B would raise the sales tax to 6 percent, cut propertytaxes some $1.5 billion and put about $350 million more intoschools.   ``Proposal A has money and B doesn't,'' said state Sen. DanDeGrow, a Republican and a Proposal B backer. ``But they both facean uphill fight.''   Proposal A, backed by the governor, has a campaign budget ofabout $3 million and an impressive list of supporters, includingtwo large teachers' unions and major corporations.</TEXT></DOC>
