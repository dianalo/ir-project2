Virtually all the major Japanese and American hardwaremakers, as well as key software companies, agreed in meetingshere this month on industrywide standards for integratedcircuit memory cards, credit-card-sized replacements orsupplements for floppy and hard disks.</LP><TEXT>   An IC memory-card standard allows card-makers to producethe same pieces, and software houses to write similarprograms, for the whole industry. It also makes it easier forusers to work with different brands. Those factors all helpcreate the critical mass necessary to attract hardware andsoftware companies, and to drive unit prices down.   &quot;Everybody in the industry has been waiting for thisstandard,&quot; says Tom Shigeta, senior staff manager of OEMsales for Microsoft Co.'s Japan office. An official agreementwill be released by the beginning of June.   The technology still faces other hurdles, however, mostnotably a price much higher than the market rate for floppydisks.   The standards committee includes representatives fromInternational Business Machines Corp. and Japan's largestpersonal computer and semiconductor makers, such as NECCorp., Toshiba Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. Microsoft and LotusDevelopment Corp. also played a major role in thediscussions.   The agreement doesn't require the participants to matchthe standard. But many companies interviewed said they planto introduce personal computers based on the agreement withinthe next two years. Most said they didn't want to beidentified because they don't want to reveal future productplans. Fujitsu displayed a prototype memory-card machine atan electronics show in Tokyo last week, and company officialssaid they hope to sell such a machine in less than two years.   &quot;By this December, there will be half a dozen {ICcard-based} PCs, some of the notebook type, others of thepocket type,&quot; says Daniel Sternglass, president of DatabookInc., an Ithaca, N.Y., peripherals company active in workingon the standard.   Currently, NEC, Atari Corp., and Poqet Computer Corp.,Sunnyvale, Calif., which is 38%-owned by Fujitsu, makecomputers using IC cards instead of disks, while many makerssell machines that use cards in addition to disks. Severalelectronic notebooks or organizers, such as the Wizard madeby Sharp Corp., also use IC memory-card technology. Of thosemachines, only the Poqet machine currently is close to thenew standard.   IC memory cards eliminate the need for moving parts indisk drives, cutting weight, energy use, and increasingdurability. Some companies say such machines could be made atone to five pounds, compared with five to 10 pounds for mostcurrent laptop machines. Many laptops drain theirrechargeable batteries within three hours. The Poqet PCclaims to run up to 100 hours on two AA-sized batteries,although many analysts say it's too small to be considered atrue personal computer.   Such attributes are considered increasingly important asthe industry heads toward greater portability, spurred by awave of light laptops in the past year. In Japan, somestudies estimate that laptops, which had only a negligibleshare of the PC market two years ago, could account for asmuch as half of the market by 1992.   &quot;PCs are getting smaller and smaller, lighter andlighter,&quot; says Hiromi Yamamoto, a Toshiba technologyengineering manager. &quot;Sometime in the future, a floppy diskmay be too big, and a new media will be required.&quot;   For now, IC cards are still very expensive. IC cards cancost around $20, while comparable floppy disks sell for about50 cents, some officials say. Some estimate costs will haveto be cut by one-tenth to make the technology commerciallyviable. As a result, &quot;many systems makers are probably stillskeptical,&quot; says Keiichi Adachi, an NEC engineering managerwho helped develop the hardware standard.   Advocates of IC memory cards say its advantages willpersuade users to pay a higher price. They also say costswill come down as sales volume increases, and as technologiesimprove.   The Japanese companies, represented by the JapanElectronic Industry Development Association, and the Americancompanies, represented by the PC Memory Card InternationalAssociation, have agreed on physical standards for the cards-- such as the dimensions and the number of pins -- and abasic operating system, compatible with Microsoft's MS-DOSand Digital Research Co.'s DR-DOS. Negotiations arecontinuing on other features, such as making the softwareexecute on the memory card, but the companies say they expectan agreement on some of those aspects by the end of themonth, and the rest by September.</TEXT></DOC>
