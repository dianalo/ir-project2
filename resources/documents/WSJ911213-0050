Casey, president and chiefexecutive officer of the Resolution Trust Corp., reflects afundamental misunderstanding of both the thrust and thesubstance of my Nov. 4 editorial-page article (&quot;The AppallingCost of the RTC's Haste&quot;), and an apparent lack of knowledgeabout real estate in general.   Mr. Casey wrote, &quot;Mr. Clemente advocates that the RTCcomplete development&quot; of an unfinished real-estate projectknown as Potomac Crossing, near Washington, D.C. Readers ofthe original article will know that I said just the reverse:that the property should have been &quot;held and managed with aneye toward maximizing the value and utility of the propertywithout taking any risk of development.&quot; I suggested that theRTC do the minimum necessary to ensure that the remainder ofthe project (in which 318 families already had bought homes)would have sewer capacity and that whoever buys PotomacCrossing from the RTC would be able to subdivide theremaining land into 625 building lots.</LP><TEXT>   Had the RTC acted in a prudent manner, private-sectorinvestors would today be building streets, sidewalks andhouses. Absent that minimal effort in this already vibrantcommunity of affordable homes, the property held by the RTCfor the taxpayer would go to seed.   Mr. Casey's letter also leaves one wondering whether thegovernment's right hand knows what its left hand is doing. Heasserts that even if the RTC provided additional money forthis project, the taxpayers would not benefit, sinceConnecticut Bank andamp; Trust holds an 80% interest in theproject. But the RTC ought to be aware that Connecticut Bankandamp; Trust was part of the Bank of New England, which was takenover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. shortly after theRTC took over Potomac Crossing. The RTC's mishandling of theproject thus not only slashes the value of amultimillion-dollar property needlessly, raising Sandamp;L bailoutcosts to the taxpayer, but it also drastically reduces thevalue of an asset held in significant part by another federalagency, the one in charge of failed banks]   The RTC's level of understanding of the marketplace isrevealed in a reference to what is termed a &quot;current surplusof troubled residential-development projects in theWashington metropolitan area.&quot; The RTC, having failed tolisten to local experts, is evidently unaware that one partof the real-estate market here is quite active: the sale ofaffordable building lots to home builders and the sale ofaffordable houses to home buyers. Potomac Crossing wasaffordable for both builder and consumer.   Last, Mr. Casey, lacking any real arguments to justify theRTC's actions at Potomac Crossing, makes reference to thefees paid to my firm. As I made clear in my article and intestimony before the Senate Banking Committee, my firm didprovide advice on Potomac Crossing to United Savings Bank,whose management believed our efforts would hasten therecapitalization of United Savings with profits from the saleof Potomac Crossing to national home-building companies.These companies were ready then, and are ready now, to buildhomes there once subdivision plans were approved. Thein-depth study we did for the RTC was at an hourly rate of$85. Our goal then and our goal now is to prevent a horriblewaste of time, assets and taxpayers' money.   The RTC would do the taxpaying public a service by takingthe advice of real-estate experts and not just the narrowviews of the agency's &quot;get rid of it at any price&quot;liquidators.   C.
