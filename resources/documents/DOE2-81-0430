This phenomenon already has producedsome far-reaching consequences that will become even more important andpervasive in the near future. First, he describes the factors and logicthat led to these arrangements. Next, he outlines some of their practicalconsiderations and implications. While some of the market factors describedare applicable to any non-integrated producer, he spends most of histime discussing OPEC and &quot;neo-OPEC&quot; producers such as Mexico. These arethe people doing the deals and are therefore probably of greatest interest.</TEXT></DOC>
