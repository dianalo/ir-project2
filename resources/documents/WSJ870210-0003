On July 16, for the first time ever, Congress will leave the seat of government (Washington, D.C.) and meet in session somewhere else (Philadelphia).    The congressional road show is part of this year's celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. Philadelphia, where the Constitution was debated, drafted and signed in 1787, has scheduled events all this year. So far, few outside the city have paid much attention.    The host city is betting the indifference will change when people get a whiff of its made-to-order congressional media spectacular: one hundred senators and 435 representatives conducting separate and joint sessions of Congress in a re-creation of the actual House of Representatives and Senate chambers housed in a $2 million, temporary high-tech building within hailing distance of the Liberty Bell.    THERE IS A MINOR technicality. Congress hasn't actually voted to make the trip. But a concurrent resolution to travel to Philadelphia passed the Senate unanimously last session, and leaders expect similar resolutions to sail easily through both houses in the next few weeks. The House has already reserved the entire 437-room Hershey Hotel in downtown Philadelphia for the night of July 15, and the Senate is looking at a hotel of its own. U.S. Capitol police have reconnoitered the area for security purposes.    &quot;We believe it's a done deal,&quot; says Dianne Semingson, president of We The People 200 Inc., organizer of the year-long celebration.    Ms. Semingson concedes that word of Philadelphia's fete has been slow getting out, but she says Congress's visit will change that. &quot;People think about the Constitution and their eyes glaze over,&quot; she says. &quot;But this celebration is a real sleeper. It will grab hold like the Statue of Liberty and the Los Angeles Olympics.&quot;    Congress's part of the extravaganza is expected to run something like this: On July 15, members gather in Philadelphia for a reception and dinner (&quot;This could be their first time they've all had dinner together,&quot; Ms. Semingson notes.), followed the next day by separate sessions of the House and Senate. Business will be conducted inside an ersatz Capitol -- a 60,000-square-foot structure built of tubular steel with a translucent roof and interior walls decorated to resemble the House and Senate chambers in Washington. The building will be used for various bicentennial events from May to October and then demolished.    THE CONGRESSIONAL HALL is being erected on a brick-covered mall a block from Independence Hall, where in four months during the summer of 1787, Colonial statesmen hammered out the blueprint for governing the infant republic.    Debate this time around won't be so lofty. &quot;It will clearly be on the ceremonial side,&quot; says Richard Baker, the Senate's official historian. Simply keeping publicity-rabid members away from the microphone during the historic session will be a problem, adds Raymond Smock, historian of the House. &quot;You can't have everybody talk,&quot; he says. &quot;If all 435 members have one minute each, you're talking about seven or eight hours.&quot;    As to the cost, Congress is picking up the tab for travel, accommodations and administering its sessions. The J. Howard Pew Memorial Trust, William Penn Foundation, and Bell Atlantic Corp. are donating $1.6 million to cover the reception, dinner and office space and logistics for the congressional session. Planners are still looking for a corporate sponsor to underwrite the $2 million congressional hall.    Sentiment favored July 16. On that date in 1787, delegates to the Constitutional Convention accepted the &quot;Connecticut compromise,&quot; which fashioned the houses of Congress in their present form. Big states were given power in the House with representation based on population. Small-population states were given equitable footing in the Senate, where every state has just two members. The compromise &quot;saved the Constitution, which was going down the drain at that point,&quot; says Mr. Baker, the Senate historian.    CATCHING CONGRESS was a coup for the Philadelphia organizers. They haven't been so lucky with the U.S. Supreme Court. Retired Chief Justice Warren Burger, head of the federal constitutional bicentennial commission, promised last year that the full nine-person court would appear in Philadelphia.    The current court members have nixed the deal, partially out of pique at Justice Burger, observers say. Toni House, Supreme Court spokeswoman, cites a federal statute prohibiting the Supreme Court from sitting anywhere outside the nation's capital. In private conference, Ms. House says, &quot;all nine (justices) agreed they couldn't hold an honest-to-God session outside Washington, and all nine agreed they wouldn't go to Philadelphia to hold a ceremonial session.&quot;    There's precedent either way. The full Supreme Court joined President Grover Cleveland in Philadelphia in 1887 for the Constitution's 100th birthday. But in 1976, when invited to Philadelphia for the bicentennial celebration of the Declaration of Independence, the court said no.    &quot;They're a unique group of people,&quot; Ms. House says. &quot;It's just the way they are.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
