<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-0681 </DOCNO><TEXT>Although aggregation of impurity centres in doped alkali halides uponX-irradiation is proposed earlier, direct evidence of such centres havingdipole moment is reported here for the first time by the method of ionicthermocurrents (ITC). The normal dipolar relaxation band in KCl:Pb islocated around 224 K, while sometimes a small band at about 160 K isfound in the ITC spectrum of heavily doped systems. Exposure to X-raysincreases this band around 160 K at the cost of the 224 K dipolar band.Optical absorption in the A-band of KCl:Pb, along with ITC measurementsindicates that higher aggregates of I-V dipoles are easily formed inheavily doped systems. Formation and growth of the 160 K ITC band uponX-ray irradition are explained from the fact that the effect of X-irradiationis to increase the rate of aggregation of I-V dipoles, through temporaryelectron trapping by lead ions.</TEXT></DOC>
