Pioneeredby Westinghouse in the 1960's, this technology is based upon the abilityof stabilized zirconia to operate as a solid electrolyte at elevatedtemperatures. It is illustrated that the cells readily conduct oxygenions from an air electrode (cathode) where they are formed, through thezirconia based electrolyte to a fuel electrode (anode), where they reactwith fuel gas CO or H/sub 2/ or any mixture, e.g., steam reformed naturalgas, and deliver electrons to an external circuit to produce electricity.These fuel cells operate at temperatures near 1000{sup 0}C and are thebasic building blocks for highly efficient combined heat and electricpower, or all electric power generators.</TEXT></DOC>
