I say that is wrong and that is unfair.''   Mitchell, D-Maine, was referring to Bush's proposal to cutcapital gains taxes and the 30 cents an hour difference betweenBush's offer to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by 1992 andthe $4.55 target contained in legislation passed by both the Houseand Senate.   The White House and congressional proposals also differ onwhether employers should be able to pay newly hired workers asubminimum wage. Bush has said he will not sign any increase unlessthere is a six-month ``training wage'' covering all new employees,while both the House and Senate bills include a two-month trainingperiod with significant eligibility restrictions.   A conference committee is resolving differences between theHouse and Senate bills before the measure can be given finalpassage and be sent to Bush, who has promised to veto it.   The president appears to have enough votes to sustain a veto,but Democrats have decided on a vigorous campaign in favor of thebill in hopes of gaining a political edge should Bush hold fast tohis veto threats.   ``We're going to fight,'' Mitchell said. ``The president isagainst us.''   Mitchell delivered a lengthy defense of the Democratic Party andquestioned Bush's campaign call for a ``kinder, gentler'' nation.   ``We've made mistakes,'' Mitchell said of the Democrats. ``We'vegone too far in some cases. But if this is a kind and gentle nationit is Democrats who made it so, and if it is to become kinder andgentler it is Democrats who will make it so.''   Mitchell also said that ``with or without'' Bush the Democratsplanned to move forward with their domestic agenda, includingprograms for the homeless, environment, health care andinfrastructure.   ``We've got a public agenda that won't wait and we're not goingto wait,'' Mitchell said.</TEXT></DOC>
