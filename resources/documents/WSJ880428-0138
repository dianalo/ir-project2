Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson won't be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, but he is going to be the man Gov. Michael Dukakis will be forced to deal with.    And Willie Brown, speaker of the California Assembly and chairman of the Jackson campaign, has some ideas about how the cards should be cut.    Mr. Brown wants a Jackson-style keynoter at this summer's national convention; a platform tilted to Jackson issues, urging, among other controversial items, defense cuts in &quot;incredible amounts&quot;; and a commitment that the Democratic Party concentrate all its resources registering blacks and Hispanics and getting them to the polls.    He hints, too, that the Jackson forces may be prepared to veto Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn as Mr. Dukakis' running mate. And he says the sooner party chairman Paul Kirk &quot;leaves, the better the party will be.&quot;    Mr. Brown, one of the most powerful black politicians in the nation, talked with Wall Street Journal reporters and editors this week as Mr. Jackson was being crushed by Gov. Dukakis in Pennsylvania.    Mr. Brown, who may not always reflect Mr. Jackson's views, took a hard line. A savvy politician, he may have been posturing to enhance his role within the Jackson inner-circle, or he may have been staking out a position as a power in his own right in the Democratic deliberations. Or both.    &quot;I think,&quot; he says, &quot;the Democratic Party is going to have to accept the reality it cannot win unless its candidate embraces the Jackson concept and ability and technique of expanding the voting pool.&quot;    That means registering blacks and Hispanics and, if necessary, neglecting whites. And if that upsets white voters? &quot;I think we have to take that risk,&quot; says Mr. Brown.    &quot;We are not going to go look for them (unregistered white voters) until we're sure every black and every Hispanic is registered,&quot; says Mr. Brown.    Chairman Kirk isn't so sure of that. Mr. Brown, he says, &quot;has a full agenda of his own and works 3,000 miles away&quot; and may not know what the national committee already is doing to register blacks and Hispanics. &quot;But if we should take anyone for granted, shame on us. We can't forsake one group for another,&quot; Mr. Kirk says.    Mr. Brown insists Mr. Jackson is still running for the presidential nomination. Delegates still to be chosen &quot;wouldn't be available to us if we aren't in pursuit of the top of the ticket,&quot; he says.    So the pursuit will go on, with the Jackson campaign developing more and more a life of its own, so that &quot;Jackson is not totally in control of the Jackson movement,&quot; Mr. Brown says. &quot;He (Mr. Jackson) will have pretty much influence, but there will be some independent evaluations being made by lots of participants in the Jackson movement as to whether or not what is occurring in the democratic process is appropriate for the level of contribution Jackson has made and the Jackson movement has made.&quot;    There are a number of things the party can do to recognize the &quot;reality&quot; of the Jackson movement. A keynote speaker, for example. Mr. Brown tosses out two names -- Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower, a Jackson supporter and a stemwinding populist, and Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a somewhat more subdued orator but a populist all the same.    Next, the platform, which Chairman Kirk and other party leaders have long hoped would be a simple, short document bare of legislative details.    Mr. Brown says the platform should endorse legislation to keep plants open and protect workers' jobs. The platform should ratify Mr. Jackson's anti-drug program. It should address &quot;the whole question of how you deal with Third World nations in terms of foreign aid and foreign assistance.&quot;    But Mr. Brown, making an &quot;independent evaluation,&quot; splits with Mr. Jackson on the question of raising taxes. Mr. Jackson says upper-income taxpayers, those making more than $190,000 a year, should return to a 38% income-tax bracket rather than stay at the 33% rate provided by the 1986 tax law. He also proposes tax increases for corporations.    &quot;I'm suggesting that advocating tax increases is not a terribly attractive political alternative,&quot; says Mr. Brown. Instead, he says, the Democrats should &quot;go directly to the defense budget, and you have to go to it in incredible amounts.&quot; He also proposes that Japan and Europe pick up more of the cost of their own defenses, a regular item in the Jackson agenda.    A week ago, interviewed by the New York Times, Mr. Brown said that if Mr. Jackson lost the nomination to Gov. Dukakis, he should go on the ticket as the running mate.    Mr. Brown has changed his mind on that. &quot;We're not even thinking in those terms,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm not sure he's interested in the other half of the ticket.&quot;    On Sen. Nunn, Mr. Brown plays word games. He thinks the Georgia senator would &quot;be good running with Jackson. It would bring that balance you would need on military spending, defense and all that other kind of stuff.&quot;    But he's less convinced Mr. Nunn would help as Mr. Dukakis' running mate. &quot;I don't think Sam Nunn makes any sense if it's with someone (Mr. Dukakis) who is the heir-apparent to the Mondale wing of the Democratic Party.&quot; Walter Mondale, he says, was, in turn, heir-apparent to Jimmy Carter, who was heir-apparent to Hubert Humphrey. &quot;Consistent losers,&quot; says Mr. Brown.    Mr. Nunn, says Mr. Brown, &quot;certainly doesn't address the expanded-voter-pool question,&quot; the effort to register millions of black and Hispanic voters.    But, once again, finally, what about Jesse Jackson as Gov. Dukakis' running mate? &quot;I certainly wouldn't want him as my No. 2 person,&quot; says Mr. Brown. &quot;He's too good.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
