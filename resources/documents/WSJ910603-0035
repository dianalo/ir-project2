It was evident when he took GAF private, cutting his priceby 20% after the 1987 stock market crash and seizing hisopportunity at a time when his prowess as a raider deterredpotential rivals. Now, stock offerings have returned tofashion, and Mr. Heyman wants the public as his partner.</LP><TEXT>   He aims to sell 17.4 million new shares, or 18%, of GAF'scrown jewel, a specialty chemicals maker known asInternational Specialty Products. The offering documentforecasts a price of roughly $14.50 a share -- a cool 29times 1990 earnings of 49 cents a share.   Merrill Lynch, the lead underwriter, won't comment; norwill Mr. Heyman. But if the underwriters -- who launch amarketing blitz today -- follow form, they will, in theirfirst breath, assert that the multiple is a good deal lowerrelative to earnings estimates for this year and beyond. Theywill add that International's earnings would be 19 cents ashare higher were it not for goodwill and depreciationcharges related to its 1989 leveraged buy-out. They will notethat insiders aren't selling. And, one expects, they willtalk about International's heady, sustained growth.   Before World War II, International's parent, GAF, was aunit of the German I.G. Farbenindustrie. It was seized by theU.S. in 1942, owned by the feds for 23 years and sold to thepublic in 1965. The company's strength is said to derive fromits German technology, but its performance didn't take offuntil Mr. Heyman won control in a proxy fight in 1983. Duringthe past eight years, the prospectus notes, &quot;net sales andoperating income have increased at average annual compoundrates in excess of 13% and 25%, respectively.&quot;   Those gains stem in large part from the raw materialacetylene, which International uses in making specializedchemicals for particular market niches. International'sproducts keep mascara from running; they allow surgicalscrubs to fight germs without harming body tissue; they endowhair spray with the power to freeze a `do' in place.   In Colgate toothpaste, an International chemical shows upas an agent fighting tartar; in Miller beer, a differentchemical keeps the brew clarified (not cloudy); still anotherenables Geritol to release its medication gradually ratherthan all at once.   The business is highly profitable, but only becauseInternational sells 200 derivative chemicals in small dosesto some 6,000 customers. The atomized and smallish size ofthe market (International's total sales last year were $512million), and the technology required, discourage potentialrivals. The prospectus cites only German-based BASF as asignificant competitor. What's more, because International'schemicals amount to only a fraction of costs for end userssuch as Colgate, the company has significant pricing power.Operating profit margins have soared to 29.7% in 1990 (and31.5% in the first quarter of 1991) from 24.7% in 1986.   Of course, at the underwriters' price, investors arebanking on such growth continuing. And sales growth hasslowed; it was 15% in 1989; 9% in 1990, and 7% in the firstfour months of 1991. Operating income growth, defying therecession, was a strong 17% through April of this year. Butwithout the engine of exploding sales, International willhave to find ever-more high-margin products to keep profitrising.   &quot;Their margins knock your eyes out,&quot; an analyst says. &quot;Butthey're selling you $1 worth of assets for $1.25, on thetheory that one day they will be worth $2.&quot; Money managerRobert Renck Jr. would invest at 14 1/2 a share, he says, butconcedes &quot;you're paying a modest premium.&quot;   There is also the risk, says Morgan Stanley's Mark Gulley,that International's profits are so high as to continuallytempt competition. Arco Chemical, eyeing a share of its fatprofit margins, recently opened a plant that would, possibly,make chemicals to compete with International. Probably, Arcois far from grabbing International's highly profitable nichemarkets. Others have talked of invading its turf, but nonehas made a dent. Still, Mr. Gulley says, &quot;the competitivedynamics could be changing.&quot;   A third, nagging worry relates to Mr. Heyman'sall-too-prescient timing. In the last go-around, GAF'sholders prospered, but not to the degree that Mr. Heyman didlater. Based on the projected IPO price, his $42.5 millionequity stake has ballooned to about $990 million. Mr. Heyman,unlike others who walked the LBO tightrope, came out awinner. Yet even at the time of the LBO, many said the $1.4billion price tag on it was cheap.   In an interview then, Mr. Heyman said he was going privateto escape the constraints of operating in public. Now hewants to escape the constraints of leverage. Does thetwo-year flip amount to more than buying from the public whenvalues were low, and selling when they are dear? &quot;I wouldalways bet with Sam,&quot; says a banker who has worked with himin the past. &quot;I would invest, but only if I'm in at Sam'sprice.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
