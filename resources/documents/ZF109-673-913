 &quot;It gave IBMeconomies and growth capabilities no one else had,&quot; says one industryanalyst.andM;The TCM consists of a ceramic substrate made of proprietary materials thathouse pathways for the 800 meters of hair-thin wires that connect the chips.andO;A metal heat sink fitted with spring-loaded pins draws heat away.andP;  In Octoberthe TCM received the 1990 Corporate Innovation Recognition Award from theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).andP;  For all itscomplexity, not one of the millions of TCMs put into service since 1980 hasfailed in billions of hours of use.andM;1-2-3 plays a key role in maintaining this zero-defects record.andP;  Since 1980Stevens has drawn on his background as a statistician to assure quality byanalyzing procedures, materials, and tools.andP;  But performing exhaustiveanalyses using mainframe software, as Stevens did back then, is a dauntingtask, requiring intimate knowledge of the SAS statistical-software package.andO;Typical PC-based statistical-software packages are often just as difficult touse.andP;  To Senior Engineer Stevens and Associate Engineer Lisa Selander, 1-2-3offered a better way.andM;They developed the Engineering Analysis System (EAS) to provide the power ofstatistical analysis to engineers who have no formal training in statistics.andO;EAS makes statistical analysis painless by presenting a single, familiarinterface to programs from different vendors.andP;  It cuts costs and increasesthe reliability of packaging's products by letting engineers statisticallytest data on new processes, material formulations, and assembly-toolcalibrations.andP;  The alternative is more-expensive, less-reliabletrial-and-error testing.andM;Associate Engineer Glen Biggs, responsible for the process that applies athin film of metal to the ceramic substrate before mounting the chips,testifies to the importance of the system.andP;  After just a week and a half ofusing EAS to analyze thickness readings from samples of coated &quot;bricks,&quot; hewas getting a clear picture of where the problems lurked.andP;  &quot;I'm now betterable to tell fellow engineers what problem areas to watch for,&quot; Biggs says.andM;EAS is already working in some 25 departments at IBM's East Fishkillpackaging operation, which produces the substrate, the heat sink--everythingin a TCM except the chips.andP;  It uses 1-2-3 Release 3 running under OS/2 andworks with Lotus Freelance Plus and specialized statistics software fromNorthwest Analytical of Portland, Ore.andM;EAS analyzes data, such as temperatures or thicknesses, that has been sent tomainframe databases by automated tools such as metal evaporators andinsulating-film applicators.andP;  Stevens wrote his own conversion programs totransform DB2 data to worksheet files readable by 1-2-3.andM;Guided by 1-2-3-generated prompts and menus, users select the file and thedata they want to analyze.andP;  Some of the menus come from worksheet macros,others from custom add-ins created with the Lotus Add-In Toolkit.andP;  Once thesystem gets the data on board, other macros and add-in programs performsimple statistical analyses within 1-2-3.andP;  The add-ins help users decide whatparameters to use (for example, the number of standard deviations to use increating control limits).andM;To perform more-complex analyses--such as process-capability studies andmultivariable regression analysis--the system sends the data to a data fileand the entered parameters to a header file.andP;  Then it uses the {SYSTEM}command to leave 1-2-3 temporarily and start one of the Northwest Analyticalstatistical programs.andP;  Entering QA followed by the name of a command file onthe OS/2 command line is enough to automatically run Quality analyst with thedesired parameters.andM;Statpak, the other Northwest Analytical package, forced Stevens to trick thatprogram into thinking it's being controlled from the keyboard.andP;  His macroincorporates the parameters that the user enters (while 1-2-3 is active) intoa &quot;script,&quot; a file containing characters that correspond to the keys a userwould press while using Statpak.andP;  The command SP[is less than]filename causesStatpak to read and act on the characters in filename as if they were comingfrom the keyboard.andP;  When the user needs to create a box plot, for example,EAS sends the appropriate characters to a file called BOXP.TXT, which causesStatpak to create a box plot.andM;EAS assists engineers unfamiliar with advanced statistics by creating anon-screen graph.andP;  Engineers who understand the production processes and thevalues being measured--for example, the thicknesses at various points of ametal film applied to the substrate--can use the graphs to interpret the datawithout having to learn the intricacies of the statistical processes.andP;  Manygraphs take the form of easily understood bell curves.andP;  Text messages at thebottom of the graph quantify characteristics, such as &quot;kurtosis&quot; (peakednessof a curve), that aren't easy to depict visually.andM;Quality Analyst and Statpak export graphs as PIC files, the same format 1-2-3Release 2.x uses to save graphs.andP;  For presentations, EAS prints the graphs ontransparencies by using Freelance Plus.andP;  The Freelance Plus component is theonly part of the system that doesn't run in OS/2, and this is the only stepthat requires user intervention.andM;Despite its sophisticated programming and links to other software, Stevensconsiders the current system to be an interim solution.andP;  By the end of 1990,Stevens and Selander plan to &quot;ship&quot; EAS Release 2, which will use 1-2-3/G, aswell as products that so far exist only in beta-test versions, notably LotusFreelance Graphics for OS/2 and WordPerfect for Presentation Manager.andO;Release 2 will use Lotus's DataLens to gather the automated-tools data andmake it available to 1-2-3/G.andM;EAS Release 2 will run faster and without user intervention, pack more powerin its spreadsheet core, and sport mouse-operated menus.andP;  Freelance Graphicsand WorkPerfect for Presentation Manager not only run under OS/2, eliminatingthe need for using the compatibility box, they also interface directly with1-2-3/G, eliminating the need to exit to the operating system.andM;IBM's engineers don't want to wait for the new version.andP;  Enthusiasm for theapplication runs high in East Fishkill, and the operation plans 100 EASinstallations in the packaging lab and 300 more in packaging production.andP;  Thesemiconductor facility at East Fishkill also wants EAS and will boost totalinstallations to about 1,000.andP;  According to Stevens, that's only thebeginning.andP;  Engineers at other IBM sites are eager to take advantage of EASto fine-tune techniques and materials, speed testing, and improve the qualityof their own components.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
