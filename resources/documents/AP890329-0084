Roh, who has tried to follow moderate policies and portrayhimself as a populist, has not gained firm control of South Korea'sturbulent politics. But the former general shows no sign of tryingto backtrack on democratic reforms despite cracking down on theopposition he faces from the left and the right.   While there are no signs that Roh could lose power, SouthKorea's chronic political unrest is likely to continue as thenation struggles to adjust to a democratic system after decades ofauthoritarian rule.   Roh said radical groups were plotting to stage a violent leftistrevolution when he stunned the nation March 20 by indefinitelypostponing a referendum on his performance. A referendum would leadto political chaos, he said.   ``The people are worried. Leftist forces are trying to ...overthrow the free democratic system,'' Roh told the nation.   He ordered police to suppress the often violent demonstrationsstaged by radical students, strikers, farmers and other groups. Agovernment report said there were more than 7,000 protests in 1988.   The government vowed further action after top dissident MoonIk-hwan made a secret visit March 25 to communist North Korea fortalks on reuniting the two nations. Enraged officials saiddissidents were trying to aid North Korea.   Some political analysts said Roh called off the referendumbecause he feared he could not win, and a defeat probably wouldhave forced the government to call new presidential elections.   ``If Roh could have been sure of winning there is no reason hewould not have gone ahead and swept away any doubt about his rightto be president,'' said an administration source, who declined tobe named.   Roh, who won presidential elections in December 1987 with 36percent of the vote, is mistrusted by people suspicious of hisclose ties to former authoritarian President Chun Doo-hwan. ManyKoreans, however, are tired of politics after years of upheaval anddon't want new instability, analysts say.   Roh has shielded Chun against opposition demands the formerpresident be made to account for corruption and human rights abusesunder his rule. The two took power with military backing in 1980.   Dissidents and radical students who have called for Roh's ousterare not seen as a major threat despite frequent violentdemonstrations, most analysts say, because the radicals lacksignificant public support do to their extremism and violence.   The United National Democratic Movement, a new dissidentalliance that claims Roh is a front for military rule, has failedto gain strong public support, and turnout for its rallies has beensmall.   Roh ordered a crackdown on the radicals after criticism fromconservatives about the administration's failure to end violentprotests. ``Hardliners in the military have voiced strong concernover the way Roh has handled leftists and violent laborers andstudents,'' said political analyst Park Moo-jong.   The main opposition parties also have not played a big role. Thetwo main opposition parties headed by Kim Dae-jung and KimYoung-sam remain locked in a bitter rivalry that reduces theirability to work against the government.   Roh also has started to move against hardliners within thegovernment and military who have been critical of his moderatepolicies and worried that he may not be able to maintain publicorder.   Government officials said Wednesday that hardline generals inkey posts were being retired or moved to lesser posts in a shakeupinvolving 49 generals. The military, which took power twice in thepast, has been a major political force in South Korea's 40 yearhistory.   The government reportedly is divided into moderates loyal to Rohand rival hardliners unhappy that rapid democratic reforms arethreatening their hold on power and allowing opposition groups toflourish, causing social unrest.   Roh is seeking ties with communist nations to ease tension withNorth Korea; hardliners are clinging to the anti-communism thatdominated South Korean policy for decades.   Roh moved against his hardline critics after a series ofincidents showed right wing opposition within the government wasgrowing.   Cabinet minister Kim Yong-kap, regarded as the leading hardlinerin Roh's government, resigned in March to protest what he said wasa growing threat from leftists. ``I turned in my resignation togive a warning to people against the worsening politicalsituation,'' the former general said.</TEXT></DOC>
