David Boyle of the Association of Waste Disposal Contractors saidthe freighter, Nadezhda Obukhova, was returning to Montreal with itscargo of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.   The British government had insisted that incineration of thewaste posed no threat to health and Boyle condemned the refusal ofport owners and dockworkers at the northwest port of Liverpool tounload it.   ``There is no reason whatsoever why on environmental groundsthese cargoes should not be handled,'' Environment Secretary ChrisPatten said Wednesday. ``We haven't been and we're not going to bethe dustbin of the world.''   But Greenpeace and other environmental groups that campaignedagainst the waste being brought to Britain said the freighter'sdeparture was a victory.   The ship discharged and loaded some containers but the onesholding the PCBs remained on board and the vessel sailed fromLiverpool shortly before dawn.   The PCBs had been destined for destruction in a specialhigh-temperature incinerator in south Wales.   The Mersey Docks and Harbor Co., backing dockworker leaders,refused to handle the cargo after Greenpeace succeeded with a highlypublicized protest in blocking another PCBs cargo at a south Englandport, Tilbury.   Tilbury turned away the shipment, also from Canada, afterprotesters attached a skull and crossbones banner to the freighterwhile television camera crews filmed from media launches andhelicopters.   British newspapers have taken up the issue, with mass circulationnewspapers carrying headlines such as ``Ship of Shame.''   London's liberal Observer newspaper, usually sympathetic toGreenpeace, this week accused the environmental movement of ``goingoverboard.''   Its protests are aimed at blocking 15 shipments from Canada thata British disposal company, Rechem, has contracted to handle at itsSouth Wales plant. The company says it will ``defend its position.''   PCBs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers,but have been banned in North America because of links to cancer.   Government officials argue that Britain has the technology todispose of the material and strict safety regulations.   Greenpeace spokesman Tim Birch said Wednesday that by allowingthe imports Britain was ``encouraging the global toxic wastecrisis.''   Canada's only incinerator capable of disposing of PCBs is inAlberta and does not accept wastes from other provinces.</TEXT></DOC>
