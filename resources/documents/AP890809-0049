The girl is now in foster care with a family who knows her, andwill likely remain in state custody until she dies, he said.   State District Judge Tom Rickhoff on Monday held a closed-doorhearing about the girl, citing a law requiring confidentiality inAIDS cases.   Her mother, a drug abuser, died of acquired immune deficiencysyndrome.   The youngster was left to live with relatives, but socialworkers became concerned that those surroundings were furtherendangering her life, and an emergency court order removed the girland placed her in foster care.   One of the issues believed to have been discussed in the Mondayhearing was whether the child will attend public school.   ``As far as we're concerned, she's going to go to school,''Reilly said. ``I don't think we have an obligation to tell theschool (about the disease). In fact, we may be precluded (by law)from telling them.''</TEXT></DOC>
