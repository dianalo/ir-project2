MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The ingredients of a credibility gap areshowing in the tortuous White House explanations of administrationmissions and gestures toward China, a private easing of publiclydeclared sanctions. It is an account heavy with fine print and finedistinctions as President Bush and his spokesmen argue thatAmericans were not misled by secret diplomacy.   Administrations that offered hairsplitting definitions indefense of their actions have had trouble before. Lyndon B.Johnson's credibility problems began when he shaded meanings tocreate impressions that would build support for his policies.   The controversy over the Bush administration's secret andsecretive China overtures is not ended, only on hold because ofU.S. intervention in Panama. It will be revived, with an effort tooverride a Bush veto of a bill extending visas for Chinese studentsdue soon after Congress reconvenes Jan. 23.   The administration's sanctions were imposed June 20, after themassacre in Tiananmen Square that began China's repression ofdemocracy demonstrators. Bush was said to have suspended ``allhigh-level exchanges of government officials'' while haltingmilitary exchanges and postponing international loans to Beijing.   But within two weeks of that decree, Bush secretly sent two topofficials to Beijing on a mission disclosed Dec. 18 after it hadbeen reported by Cable News Network. The same two men, BrentScowcroft, the national security adviser, and Lawrence S.Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state, went to China on Dec. 2and 3; that trip was announced at 2 o'clock on a Saturday morning,after they had arrived. Bush's spokesman said the Chinese wanted itdone that way.   The second trip had stirred sharp criticism from congressionalDemocrats who said the Chinese hadn't done anything to warrant aneasing of the sanctions, which some critics had said were too tamein the first place.   Bush said he ordered those contacts with China because improvedrelations serve U.S. interests, and because a nation of more than 1billion people should not be isolated.   The initial, secret trip came to light a day after theadministration sent Eagleburger to brief a top congressionalDemocrat on the December mission to Beijing _ while withholdingword of the one in July. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, said he was astonished to learn of the July mission. TheWhite House said Bush sent Scowcroft on that one to tell theChinese of his shock and concern at the Tiananmen killings.   Bush by then had ordered the sanctions. He and Scowcroft hadconfronted the Chinese ambassador with the same message at a WhiteHouse meeting.   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Scowcroft was sent toBeijing ``to make sure that the Chinese did not think this was justa public statement.''   He said Bush considered it important that the July contact bekept secret from Congress as well as from the public. To thesuggestion that the Scowcroft message might have been reinforcedhad Congress been advised and joined in the reproof, Fitzwaterreplied:   ``It might carry more weight in the American way of thinking,but not in the China way of thinking.''   And Bush on Thursday said people should pay close attention tothe words he uses, insisting that he never precluded high-levelcontacts with the Chinese. ``I said `no high-level exchanges,''' heclarified. ``So please look at it carefully.''   Secretary of State James A. Baker III wasn't careful enough _ hesaid in a Dec. 10 television interview that the latestScowcroft-Eagleburger visit was ``the first time we've hadhigh-level U.S. officials go to the People's Republic of China''since the sanctions. After the secret trip was disclosed, the StateDepartment said Baker ``regrets that he may have misled'' somepeople.   There was a further easing of the sanctions Dec. 19, when Bushlifted a ban on loans that promote U.S. business in China, andapproved the export of three communications satellites that are tobe launched into orbit by the Chinese.   Bush insisted Thursday that his policies were the right ones.``I know how China works,'' he said, ``see what we can do, make arepresentation of how strongly we feel against human rights abuse,but see what it's going to take to go forward.''   He also has said that reciprocal Chinese actions would silencesome of his critics. ``I notice now that some of the critics whowere so opposed, using this fantastically, diabolically anti-melanguage, they come up now and say well, if you get A, B and C,then it would be all right.''   That may be so. But the Chinese haven't offered any of the above.   On Thursday, Beijing condemned the U.S. move into Panama as ashocking violation of international law and demanded immediatewithdrawal.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
