The committee said, at that time, that it would notcooperate with the Attorney General, should he try to become involved,because it was 'a legislative staff matter.'&quot;andM;McCool said when the newspapers began to print reports about the politicalnature of the files and quoted unnamed state employees as saying that theyhad been forced to work on political activities while on state time, &quot;webecame really concerned and pressed harder for an inquiry.andP;  Now we have acase of a $90,000 executive director admitting that he knew about thebreak-ins and his predecessor admitting that he knew about break-ins but'instructed Land to stop.'andM;He added, &quot;The thefts had been going on for over 2 years.andP;  It seems obviousthat the committee is merely trying to contain a political meltdown for bothparties.&quot;andM;McCool says that since the Attorney General announced the investigation, thecommittee has announced that it will be re-opening its study and callingwitnesses.andP;  &quot;We are now faced with the spectre of an Ollie North type ofcircus where competing investigators are promising immunity to differentpeople.&quot; He says the Assistant Attorney General on the case met with thecommittee for about 7 hours trying to resolve these jurisdictional disputes.andO;&quot;I hope to see the whole thing played out publicly in the courts because itsapparent to me that, had it been totally left up to the committee, the wholething would have been swept in under the rug.&quot;andM;While feeling strongly that the political sensitivity of the case hashampered progress, McCool also thinks that part of the problem in getting theproper legal authorities involved was that the theft was electronic, &quot;Ifsomeone had been jimmying a window for over 2 years, climbing in and riflingfiles and it was found out, you bet there would be police all over the place.andO;There didn't seem to be sufficient understanding that the same thing wasbeing done electronically.&quot;andM;(Barbara E.
