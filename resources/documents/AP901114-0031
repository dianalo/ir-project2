(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Poor Milwaukee youngsters can continue toattend private schools at taxpayer expense while the state draftsan appeal of a ruling that the program was unconstitutionallyenacted, officials say.   A state appeals court Tuesday struck down on a legaltechnicality the law establishing Milwaukee's first-in-the-nationSchool Choice program.   It said the program was passed in violation of the WisconsinConstitution, which forbids sneaking through ``local'' programs instate budget bills.   The court did not address the program's merits.   Roger Sundby, an executive assistant to the state schoolssuperintendent, said his agency will let it continue for at least30 days, the period allowed for lawyers to appeal to the stateSupreme Court.   The program has been praised by the Bush administration forcreating a healthy competition between public and private schools.   Critics sued to block the program, arguing it undermined stateefforts to ensure that educational standards are met at privateschools and ignored the majority of students left behind in publicschools.   A judge rejected those arguments in August, ruling the programserved a legitimate public purpose. The case went to the appealscourt.   ``I'm sad they did not make a decision on merits, just on theprocess,'' said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.   ``Parental choice is a model program that holds great promisefor disadvantaged children in Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods,''he said. ``It must be given an opportunity to prove itspotential.''   The program, passed by the Legislature in the spring, wasauthorized to provide $2,500 each for as many as 1,000 studentsthis year, but only about 400 were able to enroll in about 10eligible private schools because of space limitations.   The money is deducted from the state aid provided to theMilwaukee public school system, which has about 97,000 students.   The ruling implies that lawmakers can rewrite the law andsalvage the program. Senate Majority Leader Dave Helbach said suchan effort will be undertaken when lawmakers reconvene in January.</TEXT></DOC>
