President Miguel de la Madrid's harsh condemnation of U.S.``interventionism'' echoed sentiments voiced throughout the region.   The sharpest remarks have been reserved for the U.S. deploymentof troops in Honduras after an alleged incursion of Nicaraguantroops pursuing U.S.-backed Contra rebels.   Latin American leaders also have expressed concern about thesituation in Panama, where the military chief, Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega, is trying to stifle a huge opposition campaign backed byU.S. economic pressure. But other presidents have criticizedNoriega.   Some leaders have suggested that the United States, which isoften viewed as insensitive to Latin America, is thwarting regionalattempts to bring peace to Central America.   ``It's not with the movement of armies, nor with the financingof subversion ... that the problems of this area, vital to theinterests of the Mexican people, will be resolved,'' de la Madridsaid Monday in a speech.   President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala said on Tuesday that anisolated border battle could turn into a regional conflict if U.S.troops intervened in the fighting. He was interviewed on theprivately-owned Mexico City television station Televisa.   Argentina and Colombia have expressed what they describe asgrave ``concern'' about the deployment of 3,200 U.S. troops toHonduras last week.   President Alan Garcia of Peru went a step further, vowing tovisit Nicaragua to demonstrate ``solidarity'' with its leftistgovernment.   U.S. officials described the deployment of soldiers as acombined training exercise and show of force against Nicaragua.   The United States also has about 10,000 military personnelstationed in Panama, headquarters for the American military inLatin America. Its economic sanctions on Panama have intensifiedthe demands in that country for Noriega to step down as the defacto ruler.   De la Madrid said ``the force of law'' not the ``law of force''should be used and said only ``diplomatic and peaceful negotiationscan achieve peace in the brother republics of Central America.''   The Contadora group _ formed in 1983 by Colombia, Mexico, Panamaand Venezuela to negotiate peace in Central America _ issued astatement last week calling for the United States to respect theprinciples of non-interventionism.   Several Latin American leaders, however, have critized Noriega,who was indicted in the United States last month on federal drugtrafficking charges.   Cerezo said on Tueday that Noriega should resign and he calledthe government and the opposition to begin negotiating an end totheir stalemate.   Garcia called for immediate elections in Panama and brought homePeru's ambassador for consultations.</TEXT></DOC>
