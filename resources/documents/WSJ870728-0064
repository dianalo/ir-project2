In a brief statement, the home building and building materials concern said a special committee of directors is &quot;exploring alternatives for maximizing the company's value to its stockholders.&quot; The committee is furnishing information &quot;to those parties, in addition to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., expressing an interest in acquiring the company,&quot; the company said.    Kohlberg Kravis, a New York investment banking firm, in early July proposed to take Jim Walter private in a leveraged buy-out for $50 a share, or $2.03 billion.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    Neither James Walter, Jim Walter's chairman, nor Joe Cordell, president and chief executive officer, were available to elaborate on the statement.    Jim Walter shares closed yesterday at $58.50, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Kohlberg Kravis issued a statement saying: &quot;KKR has understood from the outset that Jim Walter's board would be obligated to supply other interested parties with relevant financial information. Our relationship with the company and our proposal have always been, and remain, friendly. We therefore continue to believe we can structure a transaction that will serve the best interests of the company's shareholders.&quot;    Individuals familiar with Jim Walter said that several investment banking firms had contacted Jim Walter about possibly acquiring the company themselves.    Some Wall Street executives said it was likely that Kohlberg Kravis would be forced to raise its bid if it wished to acquire Jim Walter. &quot;You are likely to see a bidding war -- or at least a skirmish,&quot; said one Wall Street executive.    Complicating any possible bid for Jim Walter is the company's asbestos claims liability, the size of which is still uncertain. Many homes and buildings constructed prior to 1971 contain asbestos, and many suits have been filed claiming death or disease resulted from exposure to the mineral.    Jim Walter's board is scheduled to meet again next week. </TEXT></DOC>
