Notwithstanding the pending referendum, as wellas Ukraine's decision two weeks ago to sign a broad and vagueeconomic cooperation treaty with nine other republics of theFormer Soviet Union, the central question remains unresolved:Precisely what economic relationships should be soughtbetween the two principal republics, Russia and Ukraine,which together constitute 70% of the FSU's population and 80%of its gross product?   Contrary to much of the conventional wisdom, separate andsovereign economic status would be economically preferablefor both republics -- which may be why President Bush saidWednesday that he would recognize Ukrainian independence &quot;ina timely fashion&quot; if Ukraine's voters so choose.</LP><TEXT>   Prospects for economic improvement in both Russia andUkraine will be enhanced by rapid and inclusive marketizationof their command economies. In turn, marketization depends onthe simultaneous, or at least contemporaneous, implementationof six essential reforms:   1) Monetary reform to ensure control of the money supplyand credit;   2) Fiscal control to assure budgetary balance and to limitmonetization of a budget deficit if one occurs;   3) Price and wage deregulation to link prices and wages tocosts and productivity, respectively;   4) Privatization, protection of property rights, and thebreakup of state monopolies (including the defense industry);   5) A social &quot;safety net&quot; to protect those who may becomeunemployed; and   6) Currency convertibility.   The first two elements (monetary reform and fiscalcontrol) and the fifth (the social safety net) create thebroad macroeconomic environment that enables the incentivemechanisms of the other three to move resources toward moreefficient and growth-promoting uses.   The proposals that Boris Yeltsin has recently induced theRussian Parliament to accept include most of these essentialelements. The challenge and uncertainty lie in theirimplementation. Prospects for successful marketization willbe helped by separate and independent status for the Russianand Ukrainian republics, perhaps followed by a very looseconfederal union.   Less bureaucratic interference and fewer delays can beexpected if the republics are economically separate ratherthan joined. One reason relates to the diseconomies of scalein large bureaucracies: A bureaucracy that covers bothUkraine and Russia will simply be bigger, more cumbersome,and less flexible than a smaller one. A second reason is thatmarketization will be able to proceed more rapidly if it isseparate from the ethnic and nationalistic overtones andsecond-guessing that is likely to be heard if Russia andUkraine are closely linked.   Separate and independent republics would provide greaterroom for experimentation with different modalities of reform.There isn't a single demonstrably preferable mode ofprivatization. It should be possible to experiment withseveral different modes if the experimenting units aresmaller.   Fiscal and monetary control is probably easier toaccomplish if the units that seek these macroeconomic goalsare smaller. Price and wage deregulation, will be neithermore nor less difficult if the two republics are separate orjoined. As noted above, property rights and privatization areareas for active experimentation with alternative modes, andthis should be easier to do in small rather than largepolitical jurisdictions. The social safety net may be onearea in which a larger economic entity rather than twosmaller ones is preferable because it would provide moreopportunity for spreading risk (analogous to hedging byportfolio diversification). However, Ukraine should beeconomically large enough to bear this burden.   Finally, prospects for moving to currency convertibilityare better if the two republics are separate, each with itsown floating but convertible rate. Ukraine can probablyaspire to achieve this more quickly than either Russia alone,or the two republics together.   To be sure, numerous economic arguments have been advancedagainst separation and in favor of close linkage betweenUkraine and Russia. But these arguments are unconvincing.   One argument is that the Russian and Ukrainian republicsshould be closely joined because they are economicallyinterdependent as a result of decades of monopolisticindustries located in each area. The short rebuttal to thisis simply: Free trade between the republics. This, combinedwith rapid movement toward price and wage deregulation withinboth republics, will be necessary to uncover the realities ofcomparative costs that have been obscured by command prices.   Second is the argument that it will be more difficult todivide the $70 billion of external Soviet debt if therepublics are entirely separate from one another. But thismisses the point: The real burden of debt servicing willinevitably be the subject of dispute and negotiation amongdifferent parts of the FSU,whether the republics areintegrated or separate.   A third argument is that convertibility will be harder toestablish if there are two separate Ukrainian and Russiancurrencies. This argument is also flawed. If both currenciesare convertible, convertibility between them is established,de facto. If, on the other hand, only one is convertible,then at least the process of reform has advanced in thatsingular case.   In sum, two are better than one. If the U.S., chooses, forpolitical reasons, not to take a position in favor ofseparation of the two republics, it should, for economicreasons, at least avoid favoring a close linkage betweenthem.   ---   Mr. Wolf, is dean of the RAND Graduate School in SantaMonica, Calif., and director of RAND's research ininternational economics.</TEXT></DOC>
