The rule was originally created in 1970because the production studios complained that network powerwas stifling program diversity. With the weakening of thenetworks, and the purchasing of many studios by giganticcorporations, many say that complaint now looks obsolete. TheFCC has, however, declined to change its mind: Yesterday'svote, while it loosened existing controls slightly, continuesto regulate Hollywood-network contracts. The following areexcerpts from FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes's dissent fromyesterday's decision:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Today I am casting my first dissent since becomingchairman of the FCC in August 1989. I join my distinguishedpredecessor, Dean Burch, who 21 years ago dissented from theReport and Order imposing these rules. So while I amdisappointed to be unable to join my colleagues, I am pleasedto find myself in the company of past chairmen of the FCC,President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, the Departmentof Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, who have allregarded the FCC's intervention in network and Hollywoodbusiness relationships as unwarranted and harmful.   The video programming marketplace of the 1990s stands instark contrast to the 1970 marketplace that prompted thecommission to adopt the fin/syn rules. In the last 20 years,there has been a dramatic expansion of programming outlets.The number of independent stations has more than quadrupled,cable penetration has increased from less than 10% to over60%, cable networks have grown exponentially, and a fourthtelevision network -- Fox -- has emerged.   As these new outlets have developed, the networks havefaced increasing competition for video programming from otherprogram distributors and from each other. Indeed, in contrastto the dominant position they held in 1970, the networkstoday in aggregate purchase less than half of all prime timeentertainment programming. Despite allegations that theyenjoy the advantages of oligopolists, the networks have seentheir program costs soar at a rate of 56%, while theiradvertising revenues have increased only 15%.   These facts have convinced me that the networks no longerare so dominant that they can &quot;extract&quot; financial interestsand syndication rights from unwilling producers. Absent thefin/syn rules, networks would become a new source ofinvestment capital for both existing and emerging independentproducers which are increasingly captives of the big studios.With appropriate safeguards, network entry would serve toincrease competition.   Today's reality is that market power lies in the hands ofcreative people, not distributors. The networks areprincipally distributors. Only in news do they possesssignificant creative talent. Even there, when CNN deliveredwhat the American public wanted more quickly and more oftenthan the networks, during the early stages of the Gulf War,millions of people abandoned network news.   The strength of cable networks, the bulk of which areowned by cable operators, is further apparent as several havebegun competing with the networks for primetime entertainmentprogramming. In 1990, the four networks purchased less thanhalf the movies made for television, and the prices paid bytheir cable competitors generally equalled or exceeded theprices paid by the networks. Nor is series talent in any way&quot;captive&quot; to the networks. Over the past several years,almost half of one network's lead series actors &quot;crossedover&quot; to cable.   Despite this record of network attenuation, the FCC willact today in an intensely regulatory manner. In fact, themajority have piled regulations on top of regulations. Oneundesirable effect is to further insert the federalgovernment into Hollywood-network contract negotiations.   Each of us wants good quality TV. Each of us wants programdiversity. Unfortunately, I see a quite different world fromtoday's majority.   I see rules which handicap local broadcasters -- the solesource of free TV -- at a time when stations are going darkand cable alone enjoys strong revenue growth. Ironically, atthis meeting we just implemented Congress's decision to placenew limits and requirements on broadcasters' children'sprogramming.   I see today's fin/syn decision coming from a majority ofthe same commission that several months ago declined toendorse or impose &quot;re-regulation&quot; on cable television becauseof the dynamic changes in the video marketplace, and theprospect that competition to cable might develop in thefuture.   I see rules that unwittingly provide disincentives for thenetworks to produce news and public affairs programming.   I see rules that place the federal government at thenegotiating table when the rights for prime-timeentertainment series are negotiated -- regardless of whetherthe ostensible beneficiary of such &quot;protection&quot; is a new,untried producer or a multinational, multi-billion-dollarcorporation.   I see rules that handicap American institutions in theirnegotiations with huge, vertically integrated multinationalcorporations like Time Warner, Matsushita and Sony.   I see major U.S. production assets being bought by foreigncompanies while our rules discount the potential of strategicalliances between U.S. firms.   I see a fourth broadcast network, long a prime objectiveof FCC regulatory policy, artificially thwarted in theostensible name of fostering diversity.   And finally I see a system of rules built on a foundationof outdated perceptions and misplaced concerns whoseinevitable result will be to restrict the networks' freedomof expression, as well as the diversity and quality ofprogramming available on free, over-the-air television.   Accordingly, I dissent.</TEXT></DOC>
