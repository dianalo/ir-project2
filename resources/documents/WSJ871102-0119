But the hypocrisy that engulfed Robert Bork carries risks for the special interests. Judge Ginsburg is eminently qualified, and many people who sat out the Bork fight -- liberals and conservatives -- are ready to enter the fray at the first sight of falsehood.    His youth may irritate lobbyists who could have had a 60-year-old, but what really makes them mad is that President Reagan made good on his pledge to nominate another major figure of intellectual conservatism.    Even at 41, Judge Ginsburg is among the most experienced nominees. He clerked for Judge Carl McGowan and Justice Thurgood Marshall. He taught law at Harvard for eight years, writing on the critical topics of that period, antitrust and government regulation. Before joining the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, he was deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust, a top officer at the Office of Management and Budget and then assistant attorney general for antitrust. William O. Douglas was younger, had taught law, but was never a lower-court judge.    The key question is whether the anti-Bork forces truly want a rematch. Is the NAACP going to accuse a former law clerk to Justice Marshall of Jim Crow sentiments? Is Norman Lear or the American Jewish Congress going to smear the first Jewish nominee in the nearly 20 years since Abe Fortas? Does the National Organization for Women want to defeat the quintessential feminist nominee, a man who insisted that his daughter take the surname of his obstetrician wife? Will the ACLU vilify his belief in First Amendment rights for broadcasters?    The answer, of course, is yes. The special interests want to beat up Ronald Reagan until he bounces off the ropes and hits the mat. Here is Ralph Neas on &quot;Nightline&quot; the day Judge Ginsburg was nominated: &quot;If it does become a major controversy there may not be a Supreme Court nomination for President Reagan. Because we're getting very late in 1987. In 1988, the primaries, the caucuses start. The president could run out of time.&quot;    Last Wednesday, before anyone knew the nominee's name, the ACLU sent a &quot;Dear Joe&quot; letter to Senator Biden urging a delay so it could find a strategy against the next nominee. ACLU director Morton Halpern wrote, &quot;In our view there is no such thing as a noncontroversial nominee.&quot; Mort asked Joe to schedule hearings &quot;only after appropriate time is provided for concerned groups to research the nominee's record,&quot; at least 60 days. The letter ends: &quot;The Judiciary Committee, under your leadership, has established important new procedures for investigating the qualifications of any Supreme Court nominee. We urge you to make clear now, before a new nominee is sent up, that such procedures will be followed in all cases.&quot;    This follows on the Teddy Kennedy strategy that succeeded against Judge Bork. The Senator boasted to the Boston Globe that he and Senators Biden, Metzenbaum and Cranston hatched the anti-Bork strategy back in July. &quot;The first point was to gain time to organize against the nomination, and so a decision was reached that there be no hearings until after the August recess,&quot; he said. This gave the special interests time to distort Judge Bork's record beyond recognition.    The fact is that these groups and know-nothing Senators had no honest objections to Judge Bork. Instead, they created a grotesque bogeyman to topple. This time, though, they may have trouble finding like-minded partners in the Senate. On Friday, Arlen Specter said, &quot;We really do have to hold back.&quot;    There is no reason for President Reagan to play the patsy for delays or disinformation. In announcing the Ginsburg selection, Mr. Reagan noted that the average start-to-finish from nomination to confirmation or rejection is 24 days. He warned that &quot;if these hearings take longer than three weeks to get going, the American people will know what's up.&quot;    The left may want to try to pull another Bork, but this time they face a reinvigorated President Reagan. The Constitution gives the president plenty of firepower to blast through any irresponsible Senate tactics. The mendacious attack on Judge Bork entitles President Reagan to use his power to make a recess appointment of a justice, and let the next Congress vote to approve him. A less drastic counter to delay would be for the President to call a special Senate session over the Thanksgiving-Christmas break.    The lesson of the Bork debacle is that President Reagan must use his powers to protect the integrity of the nomination process and the independence of the judiciary. It now remains to see whether the special interests will again drag Washington and the Senate back into their bog of demagoguery and distortion. </TEXT></DOC>
