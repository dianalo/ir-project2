These systems range incomplexity and price from modifications of nuclear medicine computersthrough additions to existing radiographic equipment to dedicated computersand angiographic suites. The radiologist faced with this new technologymust have some method of evaluating image quality and an understandingof the limitations of the system components if he/she is to make informedequipment choice and use. The purpose of this paper is to present somecriteria and simple methods for evaluating image quality in digital subtractionangiography.</TEXT></DOC>
