The dispute could be a harbinger of problems dealing withcommunist countries that are taking steps toward capitalism,experts say.</LP><TEXT>   The row stems from Commerce Department rulings that so farhave slashed duties imposed on certain Chinese manufacturersby changing the government's method for determining whethersuch manufacturers are selling goods in the U.S. atartificially low prices.   Companies such as Consolidated International AutomotiveInc., Los Angeles, are alarmed. If the decision stands, it&quot;will eventually wipe out&quot; the 60-employee company, assertsMark Plumer, its owner.   The producer of automotive lug nuts last Friday filed alawsuit against the U.S. agency with the U.S. Court ofInternational Trade. The suit accused the Commerce Departmentof using &quot;unlawful&quot; methods in determining what anti-dumpingduties to impose on a Chinese lug-nut competitor. Under thenew method the duty was 4.24% -- sharply below the 66.49%level under the prior method.   With only a 4% duty, Chinese manufacturers can produce lugnuts, which are used to attach wheels to automobiles, at lessthan Consolidated's cost of material, Mr. Plumer contends.   Many applaud the Commerce Department's move and say itsimply recognizes a changing world as communist countriesmove toward freer markets.   But other people worry about the effect on U.S. concerns.Small companies would be particularly hard hit, theseobservers assert, because the products affected by the policychange tend to be light, manufactured goods -- ranging fromceiling fans to fireworks -- that are largely produced in theU.S. by small companies. In many cases, too, the productsaffected are a small American company's principal items.   Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) has demanded from theCommerce Department an explanation of the Consolidatedruling. And Rep. Mervyn Dymally, a California lawmaker,didn't waste any time telling Commerce Secretary RobertMosbacher what he thought of how the department treated oneof his constituents. &quot;Your decision is, in effect, a licensefor the Chinese to sell in the United States at what havealways been considered dumped prices,&quot; Mr. Dymally wrote thesecretary. &quot;Countless American jobs in a broad range ofindustries are now imperiled and left without meaningfulremedy.&quot;   Previously, the department used prices in a &quot;surrogate&quot;country such as India, Pakistan or Thailand as a benchmarkfor calculating costs in &quot;non-market economy,&quot; or NME,countries such as China. The logic behind this approach wasthat NME industries are heavily subsidized and thus theirprices don't fairly reflect their true costs.   But in a case involving Chinese-made sparklers last May,the department departed from its usual practice anddetermined that some Chinese producers were &quot;market-driven.&quot;Four weeks later, the same kind of analysis was used in apreliminary ruling on a complaint filed by Lasko MetalProducts Inc. against imports of Chinese-made electric fans.   In effect, in the electric-fan case, the departmentcombined surrogate-country prices with certain Chinese pricesin calculating dumping margins on the fan imports. If thedepartment reaffirms this analysis in a final ruling to beannounced later this month, Lasko could lose a large sum. Thegovernment is recommending duties that average only 4.91% and4.64% respectively for two types of fans. The West Chester,Pa., manufacturer has urged duties as high as 165%.   The department's change of heart reflects the change incommunist countries nowadays. The Chinese factories inquestion are located in South China's thriving coastalprovinces that are awash with Hong Kong-style capitalism. Thefactory spaces are leased from the government, but the plantsthemselves are owned by local cooperatives and operated byforeign investors. &quot;This scene is almost like what Thailandwas in the 1970s,&quot; says one American lawyer representing theChinese suppliers.   The department's Sept. 3 ruling on Chinese-made lug nutswas its next major decision under its new methodology. Thedepartment continued to look to Pakistan, the designatedsurrogate country, for data on labor, electricity and freightcosts. But it also accepted as valid the relatively lowChinese steel and chemical prices cited by the producers.   &quot;We found no evidence of state involvement&quot; in the settingof these prices, argues Eric Garfinkel, assistant secretaryof commerce for import administration, in a letter toConsolidated.   Mr. Garfinkel's investigators found that the statecontrols about 45% of steel sales in China. The lug-nutproducers buy their steel from Beijing Iron andamp; Steel Co., astate enterprise, but at &quot;open market&quot; prices, according tothe department's final ruling.   Many applaud the finding. The U.S. should recognize thatChina is &quot;in transition from a centrally planned to amarket-oriented economy,&quot; argue the lawyers for the Chineselug-nut suppliers.   But U.S. producers that contend they have been injured byChinese imports are awaiting further Commerce Departmentjudgments. As much as $166 million in annual trade is atstake in the next three cases to be decided.   Mr. Garfinkel, in his letter to Consolidated, acknowledgesthat NME cases &quot;pose extremely complex issues which aregrowing more complicated in the light of the rapidly changingpolitical and economic circumstances in those countries.&quot; Butthe letter is silent about some of the points of law raisedby the firm. The Commerce Department insists that it won'trespond to questions about these rulings because of their&quot;juridical&quot; nature.   It could take the Court of International Trade in New Yorkas long as a year to decide the lawsuit by Consolidated.   The trade court can either reverse or affirm the CommerceDepartment's interpretation of the law. The court's ownruling can be appealed, in turn, to the Court of Appealsfederal circuit in Washington, which has the final say ondisputes about trade law.</TEXT></DOC>
