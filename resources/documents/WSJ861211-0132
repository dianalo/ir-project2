Grace andamp; Co., at an October meeting of the Southeast Bank Conference:    I take issue with the term &quot;Hispanic.&quot; Though a useful term for political purposes (in fact, it was invented for that purpose, to show our collective clout), it is not very helpful otherwise. . . . To call us all Hispanics is approximately equivalent to calling the French and Germans &quot;Europeans&quot; and dealing with them as one. Geographically accurate, but unrealistic. And certainly unproductive, if you want to win us over individually. </TEXT></DOC>
