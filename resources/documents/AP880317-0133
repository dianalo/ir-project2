Secord, one of four men indicted inthe Iran-Contra affair, vowed Thursday to ``crush this whole case''with a barrage of legal maneuvers against the independent counsel.   Shortly after a federal grand jury returned the indictmentsWednesday, Secord, a feisty retired Air Force major general,embarked on a series of interviews with reporters to denounce thecase.   He called the charges initiated by independent counsel LawrenceE. Walsh a ``creation of fantasy ... ludicrous.''   Secord, 55, an arms dealer who helped former White House aideOliver L. North sell weapons to Iran and divert the proceeds to theNicaraguan Contra rebels, has been charged with conspiracy, theft,wire fraud and conspiring to pay North illegal gratuities.   After his arraignment next week, Secord said his attorneys willfile motions to dismiss the case on a number of grounds. For onething, Secord claims Walsh did not follow all the JusticeDepartment's guidelines for independent counsels.   ``I am going to crush this whole case in hopes that nobody elsehas to go through what I have,'' Secord said in a telephoneinterview. ``I view this in military terms: they have committed anassault on me and I am going to launch a counterattack.''   Last month Walsh hired Herbert Stern, a former federal judge, tohandle legal challenges stemming from the Iran-Contra case.   Secord said he had not talked with North or the other defendants_ his ex-business partner, Albert Hakim, and former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter _ about a coordinated defensestrategy.   His big problem, Secord said, is raising money for his defense.``The only guys who win in this are lawyers,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
