It has establishedsomatic cell genetics on a firm basis making possible rapid and reliablestudies of a wide range of genetic phenomena in somatic cells in vitro.The results of such varied studies have established the validity of athesis that could not be accepted without demonstrable proof: For largeareas of genetics the results of classical and somatic cell geneticsare mutually consistent. In the period that lies ahead, this cell promisesto aid in unlocking major features of the biochemical genetics of differentiation.The advances in somatic cell genetics combined with those of recombinantDNA technology and new developments in protein chemistry and molecularimmunology promise great new achievements in solving human health problems.The sharing of these achievements by all mankind requires the establishmentof peace throughout the world.</TEXT></DOC>
