Trading volume increased tenfold as a dizzying array of exotic financial products -- including futures on foreign currencies, Eurodollar deposits held outside the U.S., and stock indexes -- made Chicago an integral link in the international financial system.    As volume soared, so did the personal incomes of the hundreds of successful traders, many in their 20s and 30s, who migrated to the free market Mecca of the Midwest. Trading pits swelled to bursting with hundreds of traders battling for a piece of the action.    But in the process, according to federal prosecutors, trading rules and customs were regularly bent, if not broken, by scores of traders on both exchanges.    What triggered the government investigation?    About three years ago, Dwayne Andreas, chairman of the huge grain processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., complained to the U.S. attorney about alleged price gouging by traders in the futures pit at the Chicago Board of Trade. Within months, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began placing agents posing as traders in the soybean and Treasury bond futures pits at the Board of Trade, and later in the stock index, Japanese yen and Swiss franc futures trading pits across town at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The government &quot;moles&quot; remained in place, taping conversations with unsuspecting futures traders and gathering other evidence, until late last December or early January.    The undercover sting operation was disclosed in mid-January as federal agents bearing subpoenas made late-night visits to the homes of dozens of shocked traders in the Chicago area. Forty-six traders were indicted yesterday, based on evidence gathered by the investigation, and more indictments are expected in coming weeks.    What are the charges against the indicted traders?    The traders are charged with defrauding customers. Mail fraud and wire fraud -- using the telephone -- are the specific statutes under which many traders were charged, but the alleged crimes occurred in the trading pits. Traders used a number of tactics allegedly to circumvent the exchanges' open-outcry trading method, in which members bid competitively for orders. Here are a few:    --Prearranged trading occurs when two or more traders buy and sell futures among themselves without offering the orders to others in the pits.    --Front-running involves brokers' trading ahead of large customer orders, which they have been given to execute, to profit from the market effect of the orders.    --&quot;Bucketing,&quot; a technique traders can employ to skim customer trading profits.    Why racketeering charges?    Several traders also have been charged with more serious fraud under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, law. RICO allows the government to seek harsher penalties, including the seizure of assets and profits earned through the alleged illicit trading activities, than it can when traders are charged with separate instances of fraud. The government alleges that indicted traders in certain cases used entire trading pits as racketeering enterprises, or vehicles for perpetrating fraud. That doesn't mean every trader in these pits is charged with fraud, and an indictment in any case isn't a finding of guilt. Critics of such broad use of RICO maintain that the statute was designed as a tool for fighting organized crime, not white-collar crimes such as futures trading fraud.    How have the exchanges policed their own markets?    The two exchanges have levied several million dollars in fines over the past few years against members and expelled several members, who were alleged to have broken trading rules. They also have increased their back-office capability to monitor trading, in response to pressure from Congress and regulators. But certain federal officials and exchange members themselves have questioned the fairness and thoroughness of the disciplinary process.    What about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission?    The federal regulator of the futures markets also investigates and fines traders, but it has been criticized since its formation in the mid-1970s for a light regulatory touch. The commission also is heavily influenced by industry leaders and has backed down in past confrontations with the exchanges. The CFTC is up for reauthorization, and congressional committees are ivnestigating what steps, if any, should be taken to make it a more effective agency.    How will the indictments affect customers? Many indicted brokers may remain in the pits, handling customer orders until they go on trial. If they do, they most likely will be on their best behavior. Indeed, after subpoenas were handed out to traders in January, one Board of Trade member said, &quot;The fills {prices at which orders are executed} have never been better.&quot; Each pit has plenty of brokers to take the place of those who leave.    Not even the most optimistic prosecutor believes the 2 1/2-year federal investigation spells the end of customer complaints about Chicago's futures marekts. But the penalties sought in many of yesterday's indictments are expected to act as stiff deterrents to flagrant trading abuses.    What is the potential effect on the exchanges?    So far, the picture has been mixed. For the first seven months of this year, the Chicago Merc's trading volume increased about one-third from a year earlier. Much of the increase came from higher volume in Eurodollar futures, which financial institutions use to hedge against moves in short-term interest rates.    At the Board of Trade, however, volume through July increased only about 1%. But trading in soybean futures has fallen 15% since the investigation was announced, and some traders believe that at least some of the decline is the result of the government investigation. Some traders say the Board of Trade's embarrassing squabble last month with Feruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. of Italy about its activities in soybean futures might never have happened if the market hadn't lost so much liquidity. In that dispute, the exchange's emergency order forcing traders to close out positions in July-delivery soybeans gave the Board of Trade a black eye in international trading circles.    Nevertheless, the futures exchanges seem certain to survive. Their trading pits offer such great opportunity that other risk-takers will replace those who leave. Also, many of their markets are important to the commodity merchants that use them to price inventories and future transactions. </TEXT></DOC>
