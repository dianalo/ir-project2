The PLO has no intention of using the 1947 United Nations resolution partitioning Palestine as a basis for negotiating the borders of a Palestinian state, says Salah Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, the PLO's second-in-command after Yasser Arafat.    &quot;We aren't talking about the borders set out in this resolution. We are only taking from it our legitimacy,&quot; Mr. Khalaf said in an interview. &quot;We can't ignore the (U.N.) partition resolution 181 because it is the sole resolution that the superpowers have agreed upon that gives us the right to establish a state.&quot;    Israelis say PLO references to the resolution, in a draft declaration of independence seized by the Israelis in Jerusalem in July, and again last week in Mr. Arafat's speech to European legislators, prove that Palestinians seek to dismember Israel and aren't simply calling for Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza.    The U.N. resolution divided territory in the then-British mandate of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. The awkwardly drawn borders gave the Arabs much of the Galilee and lands close to Tel Aviv. The Jews accepted the resolution, but neigboring Arab states rejected it and declared war on the new Jewish state.    &quot;Arab rejection of the resolution at that time was a mistake,&quot; says Mr. Khalaf. &quot;We shouldn't have to bear the mistakes of ancient leaderships. We have already suffered for 40 years because of those mistakes.&quot;    The armistice line after the first Arab-Israeli war left Israel with more land than under the partition plan, and the remainder was divided by Egypt and Jordan without a Palestinian state being declared. In the 1967 war Israel occupied Egyptian-held Gaza and the Jordanian-held West Bank.    Mr. Khalaf is considered a hard-liner in the PLO's mainstream faction, Fatah. But in the interview he echoed the new, conciliatory tone toward Israel current among PLO leaders. &quot;If there is a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank will it absorb all Palestinians? The answer is no,&quot; he said. &quot;But at least such a state would give all Palestinians a national identity.&quot; Only about 40% of Palestinians live in Israel and its occupied lands. Many remain refugees without a defined nationality.    &quot;The Americans and the Israelis know very well that what we want is a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. Because we are realistic, the 1967 borders are the subject of negotiation,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
