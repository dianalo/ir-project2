Allan Boesak, a prominentactivist who resigned his church posts after reports he had anaffair with a married woman, is reconsidering his decision to quit,his lawyer said Sunday.   Church leaders at the mixed-race branch of the Dutch ReformedChurch in Bellville outside Cape Town said at a service Sunday they``would be grateful'' if Boesak decides to return after histhree-week leave of absence.   Boesak is ``much loved by all of us,'' said Johan Retief, aco-minister at the church. Many congregants wept during the serviceand expressed support for Boesak.   However, graffiti on Boesak's office next to the church madesexually explicit references to the alleged affair between theminister and Elna Botha, a producer for government-run television.   Boesak was not at church Sunday. But his lawyer, Essa Moosa,said Boesak will ``reflect seriously on his position over the nextfew weeks and come to a considered decision with regard to hisresignation.''   Boesak, one of South Africa's best known anti-apartheid leaders,is a powerful speaker who is often at the front of anti-governmentmarches and demonstrations. He has strong ties to the AfricanNational Congress, the country's leading opposition group, and manyobservers believe he has political ambitions.   He tearfully resigned his post in a July 8 sermon followingnewspaper reports of the alleged affair. The newspapers saidBoesak's wife, Dorothy, had tipped them off, and that reportersconfronted Boesak at a Cape Town hotel.   Boesak made no reference to Mrs. Botha in his resignationspeech, but said: ``This is one of the darkest days of my life.''   ``I am deeply sorry for the the pain I have caused,'' he said.   Boesak also serves as president of the World Alliance ofReformed Churches, an international body of Protestant churches.Retief said he did not know if Boesak had given up that post.   Boesak, married for more than 20 years, was temporarilysuspended from his church posts in 1985 after he was romanticallylinked to a church secretary. He was reinstated and acknowledged a``special relationship'' with the woman.   The Sunday Times of Johannesburg reported that Mrs. Botha hadleft her husband and gone to Atlanta and that Boesak would join hershortly.   Mrs. Botha's husband, television newscaster Colin Fluxman, wastaken off the air last week after breaking down as he read an itemabout the alleged relationship between his wife and Boesak.</TEXT></DOC>
