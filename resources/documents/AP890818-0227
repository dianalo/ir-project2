Consumers are using plastic to pay for everything from newspapersand samba dance classes to ritual voodoo costumes, as a way to beatthe merry-go-round of price hikes.   Because there's no finance charge if bills are paid promptly atthe end of the month, shopping by credit card in effect can lock inprices that prevailed at the time purchases were made.   A year ago, 3.6 million credit cards were circulating in thecountry of 145 million people, industry figures show. Today thereare 6.2 million, and card marketing directors predict the numberwill quintuple by 1993.   ``You're looking at the hottest market in the services sector inBrazil today,'' said Paulo Veras Bica, director of Banco Nacional'sVisa card.   Foreign card companies are scrambling to exploit the demand,foreseeing a continuous growth in the buying power of Brazilianconsumers despite the country's staggering economic problems.   Mastercard, which in Brazil is associated with Credicard,Brazil's most popular card with 2.2 million users, has more thandoubled its number of card-holders in the last two years.   American Express card membership rose to 480,000 in June, a 30percent increase since 1987. Diners Club saw its clientele triple intwo years, to 300,000 in July.   Visa associated with two of Brazil's largest commercial banks,Banco do Brasil and Banco Nacional, and gained nearly 1 millionclients since last year.   ``We were just another card that belonged to a bank and we werefading into the sunset. Associating ourselves with Visa gave usprestige, validity and credibility,'' said Bica, Banco Nacional'scredit director.   In return, Visa is benefiting from an influx of foreign tourists,who find more Brazilian merchants willing to accept cards. Thecompany looks forward to the day when the government allowsBrazilians to use cards abroad, a practice now prohibited as a wayof protecting Brazil's foreign currency reserves.   ``Visa is gambling that soon Brazilians will be able to use theircards when they travel,'' said Ruben Osta, Finance Director forBanco Nacional's Visa card. ``They want to be here first when thegovernment gives the go-ahead.''   Brazilians are not yet as addicted to plastic money as Americancardholders, who pack an average of eight cards. But that too ischanging rapidly.   ``Brazilians are going through a change in culture,'' said MarcioSouza, director for the Bradesco bank's credit card, the No. 2 cardin Brazil with 1.85 million clients.   ``These days, credit cards are more than a buying tool or a meansof getting a loan _ they're becoming a business and socialcredential.''   A shift in banking practices underlies the trend. Checks, thepredominant form of payment during the last decade, arerelinquishing ground to automated credit transactions because banksare reducing paperwork and costs.   Security, convenience, and incentives such as 24-hourcomputerized tellers and instant access to bank accounts also arewinning new members.   ``Brazil is entering the modern age of banking and consuming,''said Jean Rozwadowski, who heads the Brazilian operations ofAmerican Express.   ``There is a tremendous upsurge in card usage,'' says Osta, ofBanco Nacional.   Unprecedented marketing drives are spreading plastic to far-offrural regions.   ``It's not easy convincing shop owners in jungle or mining townswhy they should accept a card instead of cash or gold,'' says SergioMachado, credit card director at Banco do Brasil, agovernment-controlled commercial bank, South America's largest.``But we're doing it.''   Machado said more than 75 percent of Brazilian cities withpopulations under 500,000 now accept the Banco do Brasil-Visa card,called Ourocard or ``Gold Card.''   Not even a dip in workers' buying clout and a deep economicdecline last year daunt the expectations of card companies.   ``The underground economy makes up at least 40 percent of thetotal economy,'' said Bica. ``And as it grows, people will have moreand more disposable income on the side to spend.''   Nonetheless, there is concern that the country's relentlessinflation rate could boomerang on the credit-card issuers. In Julyalone the cost of living rose 28.76 percent, and August inflation isexpected to be even higher. Computed over the last 12 months, annualinflation averages 1,000 percent.   Some merchants have taken matters into their own hands byboycotting credit cards because of delayed reimbursement by cardissuers. Others have begun charging card customers 45 percent morethan cash-paying clients, a practice that is illegal but growing.   ``Credit cards are supposed to be cash payment,'' complainedDenise Neueschwander, 34, a Rio housewife. ``But no one seems toknow that here.''   Some critics warn that turning Brazil into a credit card societycould fuel inflation even more, and eventually compel the governmentto take drastic measures to curb their use, which could help incitea recession.   But marketing directors dismiss the notion.   ``It's a fantastic future market,'' said Marcos Vinicius Araujo,spokesman for Credicard. ``We're not worried.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Aug. 21</NOTE></DOC>
