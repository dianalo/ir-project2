The steam-injection pilot was started at atime when production under primary methods was approaching abandonmentrates, and indeed many wells had already been plugged and abandoned.The viscous nature of the reservoir oil (75 cp at the reservoir temperatureof 110{sup 0}F), the presence of a gas cap overlying a large portionof the oil-bearing zone, and the poor response to waterflood pilots onthe periphery of the reservoir discouraged any further considerationof a waterflood. Although water encroachment in parts of the Nacatochreservoir was believed to have increased recovery, it was concluded thatwaterflooding would not be economic.</TEXT></DOC>
