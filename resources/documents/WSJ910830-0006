Paul, former chairman ofdefunct CenTrust Savings Bank, alleging he failed to followorders from the agency regarding his assets.   The hefty fine marks another chapter in an acrimoniousexchange between Mr. Paul and federal thrift regulators. Mr.Paul's attorneys have said that regulators and investigatorshave turned the once-extravagant thrift executive into acause celebre and are attempting to make him a sacrificiallamb for the Sandamp;L crisis.</LP><TEXT>   Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Mr. Paul, called the penalty&quot;bluster and posturing by the OTS, intended for publicrelations, but with no impact.&quot; Mr. Lowell, who says hehasn't been officially retained as Mr. Paul's attorneybecause the U.S. is keeping Mr. Paul strapped for cash, saida federal judge overseeing the battle issued an order puttingthe OTS enforcement actions on hold. &quot;If OTS director{Timothy} Ryan is frustrated by his inability to get intofederal court, then his continuing to issue internaltoothless orders against David Paul will not help resolve thecase,&quot; he said.   Not surprisingly, the OTS disagrees. &quot;The judge's rulingdoesn't affect our ability to level civil penalties,&quot; an OTSspokesman said.   In October 1990, federal thrift regulators issued acease-and-desist order against Mr. Paul and initiated anadministrative action seeking $30.9 million in restitutionfrom him. Since then, Mr. Paul has contended that he needsfunds to retain adequate legal representation. Mr. Lowellsaid Mr. Paul is &quot;a defendant in no fewer than a dozenlawsuits.&quot; However, he hasn't been charged with any criminalwrongdoing.   Yesterday, the OTS alleged that, despite a freeze havingbeen placed on his assets, Mr. Paul last October transferred$50,000 to one of his law firms, Neal andamp; Harwell, a move thatdrew a $25,000 penalty. In addition, the agency alleged thatMr. Paul transferred $200,000 to an account in Israel, forwhich the OTS imposed a $400,000 penalty.   The OTS also alleged that Mr. Paul failed to filefinancial statements as required by its order, resulting in aseries of violations for which he was assessed penaltiesranging from $2,500 to $7,500 a day. Those penalties total$942,500 to date, the agency said. Mr. Paul was ordered topay the nearly $3.2 million in penalties by Sept. 20. But hemay request a hearing on the penalties to challenge theirpropriety, the OTS said.   CenTrust, a Miami-based thrift that had invested heavilyin junk bonds through Drexel Burnham Lambert, was shut downby federal regulators last year. The failure could costtaxpayers $2 billion. Mr. Paul is under investigation bynumerous federal agencies, including the Securities andExchange Commission, the Federal Elections Commission, theOTS, the Resolution Trust Corp. and the Department ofJustice, according to Mr. Lowell.   Also yesterday, thrift regulators assessed a former NewJersey thrift official and his wife $6 million in civilpenalties for allegedly giving false statements and producingfraudulent documents about their part-ownership of a companythat received loans from Polifly Savings andamp; Loan Association,New Milford, N.J.   The fines were assessed against Robert K. Hartmann, aformer director and general counsel for Polifly, and hiswife, Patricia, for allegedly concealing their 25.3% interestin Changebridge East Inc., which received about $26 millionin Polifly loans. As a result, Polifly lost $6 million, thethrift office alleged.   The assessment is a supplement to thrift office chargesbrought in June that the Hartmanns committed fraud andconspiracy. &quot;The effect of the new charges is a littleunclear right now,&quot; said Charles Walsh, a Newark, N.J.,attorney representing the Hartmanns, &quot;except that we intendto put the matter into contest and vigorously challengethem.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
