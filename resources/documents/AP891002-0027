(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This battered city paused from cleanuplabors Sunday to thank the volunteers from all over the country whoanswered the call for help in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo.   ``What you're doing will never be forgotten,'' Mayor JosephRiley told several hundred weary workers who gathered at a noonrally. ``People from all over the country came to help a communityin need. We might have suffered some damage, but our spirit isalive.''   The mayor read several letters of support from children andother well-wishers from across the land. One envelope from formerPresident Reagan included a check from $1,000.   Officials said 63 buildings collapsed in the historic city whenHugo crashed ashore and more than 350 were severely damaged by thehurricane's 135 mph wind.   Volunteers flooded into town to remove trees, clear debris andpitch in to help people in need.   Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., an outspoken critic of the responseby the Federal Emergency Management Agency, praised the volunteerlaborers for their efforts.   ``They didn't wait to fill out a form like the bureaucrats inthe federal government ask you to. They came up here free of chargeand volunteered,'' said Hollings, wearing a T-shirt that read:``Charleston, S.C., We're Going Strong!''   ``This country's great if we can get the federal government offits duff,'' he said. ``We're going back to work to get around thebureaucratic snarl.''   Mark Chambers, a spokesman for Gov. Carroll Campbell, defendedFEMA's efforts Sunday.   ``FEMA is providing everything the state of South Carolinaneeds. We're talking about one of the most devastating storms inrecent history. It's being done,'' he said.   However, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a native of South Carolina,joined critics of FEMA's effort. ``People do not need morebureaucracy _ they need more direct help right now,'' he said.   The volunteers were treated to a hot lunch of stir-fried chickendished up by the Outer Banks Rotary Club from North Carolina.   A canvas canopy donated by the Sturh Funeral Home protected thefood from an intermittent drizzle. But it was more like a revivalthan a funeral and at one point volunteers standing in mud sang``God Bless America'' over the hum of portable generators.   Steve Desin, 45, of Vallejo, Calif., arrived Wednesday after 187days working on the Alaskan oil spill in Valdez, Alaska. Hiscompany, Cheetah Aviation Transport Service, sent four largevessels to ferry food, clothing and medicine to people on theoffshore barrier islands pummeled by Hugo.   ``These people need help,'' said Desin. ``This is what makesthis country what it is. You can kick our butts, but we'll fightback.''   Fayetteville, N.C., sent 19 police officers to help Charlestonwith traffic and curfew control.   ``These people have been kicked in the teeth. Wouldn't you helpsomeone where they're down?'' said Capt. L.E. Morgan of theCumberland County, N.C., Sheriff's Department.   Fort Lauderdale, Fla., sent 28 men plus a squadron of trucks,backhoes and heavy equipment.   ``The hurricane could have hit us,'' said Tom Carbone, 33.``This country's always sending help to other countries. This is away to help our own.''   Elsewhere Sunday, in South Carolina's upstate region, heavy rainoverflowed already swollen rivers and closed some roads.   Ten FEMA disaster application centers were open Sunday, withfour more scheduled to open Monday, officials said. As of Sunday,5,400 residents had applied for various forms of federal and stateassistance.   Seventeen counties issued food stamps to people who sufferedproperty damage or income losses. Officials said Saturday that $10million in food stamps had been issued to more than 50,000residents since Thursday. Normally, South Carolina issues $13million in food stamps over an entire month.   In Bishopville, three National Guardsmen had to be sent in torestore order when pushing and shouting broke out among people whohad been waiting for hours in a food stamp line. No arrests weremade, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
