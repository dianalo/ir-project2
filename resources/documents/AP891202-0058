Singh, 58, a former king who now heads the five-party NationalFront coalition, will preside over the first minority governmentIndia has had since it became independent from Britain 42 years ago.   Devi Lal, 75, also of the National Front, was sworn in as deputyprime minister.   Singh, a poet and painter, must now name his other Cabinetministers and win a vote of confidence from the majority of the 525members of Parliament's policy-making lower house. He has 30 daysto prove his support in Parliament.   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman administered the oath ofoffice, and Singh smiled as the crowd in an ornate chamber of thepresidential palace burst into applause.   ``I will do my duty,'' Singh told reporters after the 10-minuteceremony. ``My government will be a government of the people.''   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, now consigned to the role ofopposition leader, was one of the first to offer congratulations.``I wish him well,'' he said. ``I hope he completes his five-yearterm.''   Singh was Gandhi's finance and defense minister until 1987, whenhe resigned amid reports his investigations into governmentcorruption were proving embarrassing to Gandhi.   One of Gandhi's last acts was to free a Sikh member ofParliament who was accused of plotting the 1984 assassination ofGandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, United News of Indiareported.   The government today withdrew all charges against SimranjitSingh Mann and four others. The shots that killed Mrs. Gandhi onOct. 31, 1984, were fired by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One wasshot to death by other bodyguards. The surviving gunman and a Sikhgovernment clerk convicted in the plot were hanged in January.   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto today congratulated hernew Indian counterpart. In a message to Singh released toreporters, she said Pakistan would ``make its full contributiontowards strengthening peace and stability in our region.''   The two nations have fought three wars since 1947 and havethousands of troops on their borders.   For the past two years, Singh led the efforts to unite thecountry's usually disparate opposition parties into a cohesive blocagainst Gandhi's Congress Party. He is modest and vacillating, anunlikely leader for an ideologically diverse coalition in theworld's most populous democracy.   Singh, born to a rajah, became king of the Manda district innorthern India but gave away his small kingdom to members of thelower castes long before royal titles were outlawed in 1971.   He capitalized on a desire for change in attracting factionsfrom the left and right to support his coalition and oust theCongress Party for only the second time since independence.   India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; his daughter,Prime Minister Indira Gandhi; and her son, Rajiv, all carried theCongress banner to power.   The only other show of opposition unity came in 1977, when Mrs.Gandhi was defeated. The anti-Congress coalition, however, onlylasted 29 months.   Given the fragilility of both his formal and informal coalition,Singh may have trouble enacting any major changes.   His National Front is a centrist alliance, but to win a vote ofconfidence in Parliament, he is dependent upon the allegiance offar-right and far-left parties.   The Nov. 22-26 elections gave the National Front has only 144seats in the lower house of Parliament _ far short of the 263majority needed to carry a motion.   But it has pledges of support from the Hindu fundamentalistBharatiya Janata Party and several communist parties. Combined withthe National Front, Singh could muster 283 votes _ and probably afew more from independents and tiny parties whose have not declaredtheir allegiances.   Gandhi's Congress Party has 192 seats plus the allegiance of 17more legislators from regional parties.   Gandhi became prime minister after his mother's assassination in1984, winning a four-fifths parliamentary majority. His earlypromises to root out corruption started to bear fruit under aseries of tax raids conducted by Singh.   After Singh's resignation, Swedish and Indian news reportsdisclosed the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid as much as$50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a $1.4 billionweapons contract.   Gandhi vigorously denied wrongdoing, and the charges have neverbeen proved, but they raised serious questions about the Gandhi'sintegrity and cost him popular support.</TEXT></DOC>
