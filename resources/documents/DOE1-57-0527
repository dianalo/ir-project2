As such, most works focuson developing predictive methodologies to forecast the incidence of political-riskevents and pay scant attention to the underlying cause or theory. Thisdissertation attempts to begin laying the theoretical groundwork forunderstanding political risks by relating the analysis of political riskto a broader theory of interaction between hosts states and TNCs. Usingthe international oil industry as the content area, a conceptual modelfor the explanation of political risks is developed. The premise of thisdissertation is that the structure of the host/TNC relationship givesrise to an inherent conflict of interests and issue hierarchies betweenthe two actors. These structurally determined differences are the rootcause of political risks. The articulation and implementation of host-stateinterests in policies constitute specific political-risk events. Political-riskevents confronting transnational oil companies (TNOCs) are embodied inhost-state changes in their oil policies. Policy changes, the immediatecause of political-risk events, are explained in terms of the structuralrelationship and conflicting interests, with the timing and strategyof changes a function of the mediating variables.</TEXT></DOC>
