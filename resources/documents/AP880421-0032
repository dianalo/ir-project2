ManuelAntonio Noriega out of office, two former diplomats told Congress.   ``If anything, the tactics have entrenched Noriega,'' saidFrancis McNeil, who left the State Department last year after acareer that included service as ambassador in Costa Rica and deputyassistant secretary for intelligence.   Noriega ``may hang on long enough ... to bring the pillars ofthe temple down around him, blaming the gringos for the ruin he hasbrought upon Panama,'' said McNeil, who left the department in adispute with Assistant Secretary Elliott Abrams.   And Jack Vaughn, who was ambassador to Panama during the Johnsonadministration, called on the administration to drop its policy ofunilateral pressure and enlist allies in the effort to deposeNoreiga.   ``We've never had allies in Latin America to speak of,'' he toldthe House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee onWednesday.   The testimony came as the State Department disclosed thatAbrams' principal deputy, Michael G. Kozak, remains in Panama witha U.S. delegation reviewing U.S. moves so far and assessing optionsfor further action.   There has been division within the administration on how best todeal with Noriega. One side wants to step up pressure on Noriega togive up power and go into exile by imposing trade sanctions or eventaking military action. The other says the U.S. should negotiateand perhaps ease pressure in hopes that he will accept a gracefulexit.   Vaughn told the panel Noriega is likely to cling to power formonths, despite U.S. efforts to oust him, and will likely befollowed by a leftist regime.   ``Even if we are successful (in deposing Noriega), the price of20 years of inexcusable tolerance and blindness is likely to be astrongly leftist government,'' he said.   Such a shift to the left in Panama would be spurred byresentment toward the United States because of its support forNoriega over the past two decades and its blind eye to corruptionand fraudulent elections, Vaughn testified.   He said the United States has underestimated Noriega's stayingpower. He said Noriega's durability is tied to his ``godfather''status in the regional cocaine cartel and to deep and broadcorruption in the Panamanian government and in its PanamanianDefense Forces.   Noriega took power following the 1981 death of former Panamanianruler Gen. Omar Torrijos.   ``The cancer in the PDF has metastasized,'' Vaughn said.``They've been at it for 20 years'' with the full knowledge of theState Department, Congress and the U.S. military.   Subcommittee Chairman George Crockett, D-Mich., said an economicsqueeze intended to chase Noriega has so far succeeded only inimposing hardships on the country's population. ``The generalremains firmly in power,'' he said.   McNeil said financial pressures on Noriega ``bear a similarityto chemotherapy, treatment that can only work if it is of limitedduration because the side effects are too great.''   Even if Noriega leaves because of the pressure, ``we face asituation in which we may wind up judging that the operation wassuccessful but that the patient, Panama, has died.''   McNeil called for mediation, run by Latin Americans, betweenNoriega and his internal opposition. Offers to carry out such talkshave been made by the church and the Organization of AmericanStates.</TEXT></DOC>
