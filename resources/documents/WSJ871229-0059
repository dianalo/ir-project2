MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   A hipo, a Wallenda, and an imagineer order drinks at a bar. They do a little work -- edit a violin, non-concur with a wild duck, take care of some bad Mickey -- and then ask for the bill. &quot;This is on the mouse,&quot; says one of the three.    Who picks up the tab?    It's not uncommon to hear chatter like this from the mouths of corporate employees. Sometimes, translating it requires knowing the jargon not of MBAs, industries or regions -- but of particular companies.    For instance, an employee at International Business Machines Corp. who is fluent in IBM-speak knows that a &quot;hipo&quot; is an employee on the fast track to success -- someone with &quot;high potential.&quot; (According to one IBMer, an employee with low potential is known as an &quot;alpo.&quot;) IBM-speakers don't disagree with their bosses -- they non-concur. And anyone who non-concurs often and abrasively, but constructively, is a &quot;wild duck&quot; in IBM-speak. Former Chairman Thomas Watson Jr. borrowed that tag from Kierkegaard.    Like other tribal entities, corporations develop their own dialects as a way of linking members of the tribe and delineating their ranks. &quot;It has the double purpose of bonding the user to the group and separating the user from general society,&quot; says Robert Chapman, editor of the New Dictionary of American Slang. &quot;It makes us feel warm and wanted. This works in any society -- a company, a school, a family, a saloon.&quot;    Slang often arises in offices where words are the company's business, such as newspapers and magazines. Newsweek's top editors are known as Wallendas, after the famous family of aerialists -- a reference to the precarious nature of their jobs. Their offices are sometimes called the Wallendatorium.    Newsweek writers also call each week's top national story the &quot;violin.&quot; A spokeswoman says that's because the story is supposed to &quot;reflect the tone&quot; of the news. She says the magazine once called the second national story the &quot;cello&quot; and the top business story the &quot;kazoo,&quot; but those terms have fallen into disuse.    Most of all, slang flourishes at corporations with rich histories and cultures. At McDonald's Corp., where employees take corporate training classes at Hamburger University, loyal workers &quot;have ketchup in their veins.&quot; Patriotic citizens of Eastman Kodak Co. say they work for &quot;the great yellow father.&quot;    Walt Disney Co., one of the world's shrewdest manufacturers of cultural imagery, is a rare example of a company that has consciously invented its own jargon. It calls the division that plans its theme parks &quot;Walt Disney Imagineering.&quot; At orientation sessions (at Disney University), new theme-park employees are carefully told to say they are &quot;on stage&quot; while at work and &quot;backstage&quot; while taking a break. They are also told to consider each other not as employees but as &quot;cast members.&quot;    A Walt Disney World official says workers sometimes refer to touching scenes at the park -- a costumed character bringing a smile to a crying child's face -- as &quot;sprinkling pixie dust amongst the guests.&quot;    Jack Herrmann, a former Disney World publicist, recalls that his colleagues would brand anything positive &quot;good Mickey&quot; and anything negative -- like a cigarette butt on the sidewalk -- &quot;bad Mickey.&quot; He also remembers putting lunch on the Disney World expense account and calling it &quot;on the mouse.&quot; &quot;You're immersed in the jargon they impose upon you as a way of life,&quot; he says.    Procter andamp; Gamble Co. employees share an equally elaborate oral code. The shoptalk plays off the company's favored method of internal communication: the famous Pandamp;G one-page memo.    John Thomas, a former Pandamp;G brand manager who runs an association of company alumni, offers an example of the way years of memo-writing creep into the spoken word. &quot;In Procter-speak, someone will start to talk to you about the kind of car they're going to buy, and they'll say: 'A, I like its color; B, I think it's terrifically engineered; C, my brother-in-law is giving it to me.'&quot;    And this, Mr. Thomas says, is how a Procter-speaker would tell a friend about a day of Christmas shopping: &quot;Well, comma, I went to the store yesterday, comma, and bought a big, underline, red Santa Claus, exclamation point.&quot; Pandamp;G, he says, &quot;is the only place in the world I've ever seen that stuff go on.&quot;    Fieldwork among Procter-speakers yields numerous other examples of their distinctive vocabulary. A third is a &quot;tertile&quot; (as in &quot;the top tertile of the market,&quot; like percentile or quartile). The food service and lodging products division is &quot;flop and slop.&quot; And the company's twin-towered Cincinnati headquarters is the Dolly Parton building. Even a memo has its own code-word: &quot;a reco.&quot; That's because the model Pandamp;G memo begins: &quot;This is to recommend. . . . &quot;    &quot;We just jibber-jabbered these things all day,&quot; saysRobert Raymond, a former Tide brand manager.   A thick corporate slang can be, as it were, both good Mickey and bad Mickey inside a company. &quot;It allows us to be efficient,&quot; says management consultant Tom Peters. &quot;But it can become a form of blinders. When a company uses its own jargon and then adds the industry jargon, such extraneous people as customers never cross the linguistic doorstep.&quot;    Not surprisingly, corporate slangspeakers can also become a bit confused when they cross wires with another corporation's patois. IBM's &quot;hipo,&quot; for instance, is consultant McKinsey andamp; Co.'s &quot;squared-away associate,&quot; according to Mr. Peters, who used to be one.    Then there's the matter of the desk and the table. When workers at Prudential Insurance Co. of America's office in Roseland, N.J., want to celebrate a colleague's birthday or other milestone, they have a &quot;desk&quot; for him. At Consolidated Edison Co. of New York they have a &quot;table.&quot;    At Prudential, the term comes from the tradition of decorating an honoree's desk, though today a party in a conference room is still called &quot;a desk,&quot; reports Carl Thune, an anthropology Ph.D who designs computer systems for the insurance company. &quot;Your desk is an extension of your social persona,&quot; says Mr. Thune, who used to study oral literature in the South Pacific. &quot;So they make you important by making your physical space important.&quot;    As for The Wall Street Journal, it has more than its fair share of jibber-jabber. A few examples: The middle-column story on the front page is always called the &quot;a-hed.&quot; (The border around the headline and the three stars in the middle form a crude &quot;A.&quot;) The whimsical story in the lower left corner of this page is the &quot;orphan.&quot; Employees here write &quot;druthers&quot; letters to request new jobs and receive &quot;herograms&quot; when editors send them congratulatory notes. And the last sentence of a story is called the &quot;tag.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
