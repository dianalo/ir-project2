Inc. said Wednesday its earnings rose 26.9percent in 1988 but fell 28.5 percent in the fourth quarter becauseof a $348 million pre-tax charge to cover a restructuring at GeneralFoods.   Philip Morris, the New York-based cigarette, food and brewinggiant that completed the purchase of Kraft Inc. last month, said itearned $342 million, or $1.48 a share, in the quarter, down from$478 million, or $2.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 19.9percent to $8.64 billion from $7.2 billion.   For the full year, Philip Morris said its earnings rose to $2.34billion, or $10.03 a share, from $1.84 billion, or $7.75 a share, ayear earlier. Revenue rose 12.6 percent to $31.7 billion from $28.2billion.   The charge at General Foods USA and General Foods WorldwideCoffee andamp; International covered the closing of a Jell-O plant inLafayette, Ind., and other streamlining moves, including layoffs.Excluding that charge, fourth-quarter earnings would have risen 15.9percent.   Philip Morris said its acquisition of Kraft on Dec. 7, 1988,reduced its earnings by about $28 million, including financing costsand amortization of goodwill. But adoption of a new method ofaccounting for income taxes boosted net earnings for 1988 by $213million.   Kraft contributed $821 million in operating revenue to PhilipMorris since its early-December acquisition. However, the Kraftpurchase also boosted Philip Morris's debt by $10.6 billion,including $1 billion that was on Kraft's books.   ``As was the case when we acquired General Foods three years ago,we are assuming large additional debt,'' Hamish Maxwell, thechairman and chief executive, said in a statement.   ``We are confident of our ability to service thisacquisition-related debt and to pay it down over the next few years,as well as to sustain a good growth in earnings, volume and marketshares in 1989 and beyond,'' Maxwell said.   Among individual market segments, Philip Morris said revenue rose11.3 percent to $8.5 billion at Philip Morris USA; rose 15.4 percentto $8.1 billion at Philip Morris International; rose 9.8 percent to$3.8 billion at General Foods USA; rose ``slightly'' to $4.4 billionat General Foods Worldwide Coffee andamp; International; rose 5 percent to$2.3 billion at Oscar Mayer Foods; and rose 5.1 percent to $3.3billion at Miller Brewing Co.</TEXT></DOC>
