The trial of Jan Carnogursky was adjourned today because hisdefense attorney, Tibor Boehm, was ill. The rally began shortlyafterward, when Carnogursky's 18-year-old son read to his father'ssupporters a letter the attorney wrote to the court.   Boehm wrote that the only crime committed by Carnogursky andfour co-defendants was to speak the truth. He urged the court tofree all five in the name of democracy.   ``The defendents only tried to make people think and speakopenly, to arouse them from indifference,'' Boehm wrote.   ``Truth and justice can be deformed, but they cannot besuppressed forever,'' he said.   The trial of Carnogursky, a Roman Catholic activist and humanrights campaigner, epitomizes a crackdown on dissent that is out ofstep with the reforms in most other Soviet bloc nations. It hasdrawn widespread protest.   Carnogursky is charged with sedition and subversion for writingone article for an underground monthly in Bratislava, capital ofthe republic of Slovakia, and for signing a statement with fourother activists in August.   Those four who were detained with Carnogursky on Aug. 14 face upto five years in jail. Their trial is to begin next week.   Police have cracked down hard on mass demostrations fordemocracy in Czechoslovakia over the past two years, but securitymen watching today's gathering filmed it but did not interfere.   In court, Carnogursky, a trained lawyer who was barred frompractice after signing the Charter 77 human rights document,refused to allow a substitute defense lawyer to take Boehm's place.   Judge Stefan Cakvari granted adjournment. Carnogursky then askedto be freed pending trial.   No date was set for a new trial and no ruling was reached on therequest, which drew cheers from the crowd outside.   ``Long Live Carnogursky!'' the crowd chanted. They also brokeinto chants of ``Freedom! Freedom!,'' and ``Long Live Charter 77!''   Several church and Charter 77 activists were admitted to thecourtroom, as were Western correspondents and diplomats.   Carnogursky asked that his case be considered together with thatof fellow activist Miroslav Kusy, one of the four to be tried nextweek.   All five people were detained after signing an appeal in Augusturging people to mark the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Warsaw Pactinvasion by laying flowers in memory of people who died in theinvasion. The Soviet-led assault crushed a reform movement inCzechoslovakia.</TEXT></DOC>
