In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Emhart said it signed an agreement that it won't try to acquire the Windsor, Conn.-based maker of plumbing and automotive equipment for less than $40 a share by tender offer. It also said that if Stanadyne conducts a &quot;bidding process&quot; among other possible suitors, Emhart will be allowed to participate on the same basis as other parties. Emhart makes industrial, consumer and electronic products.    The company had complained publicly that Stanadyne's efforts to avoid its offer by luring other bidders with confidential data was unfair to Emhart. Stanadyne has urged its holders to avoid tendering stock under Emhart's $598 million offer. </TEXT></DOC>
