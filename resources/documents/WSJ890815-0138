Most members of the coffee klatch are former congressional staffers who, just a few years ago, helped draft the biggest overhaul of the federal income-tax code in more than half a century, the Tax Reform Act of 1986.    Since the big bill passed, fully half of the top tax aides to members of the congressional tax-writing committees have left their Capitol Hill jobs to lobby for many of the same corporate interests that were the bill's biggest victims. Most of the aides who have left the tax committees' own staffs since then also lobby for corporations.    Few of these former aides see anything wrong or even unusual about the transformation. But the fact that the revolving door so often leads from the tax-writing committees to the corporate world raises -- and perhaps answers -- some increasingly asked questions about why big-moneyed interests have so much success being heard on Capitol Hill.    &quot;It's obscene,&quot; contends Rep. Fortney Stark of California, a liberal Democrat and a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. &quot;They {former aides} have just sold out for the big bucks to take on special-interest tax deductions on behalf of huge corporations and rich people.&quot;    Former aides &quot;have a special kind of access,&quot; says Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a bipartisan, public-interest research group. &quot;When you work with someone in that staff-member relationship, you develop a closeness that continues off of the Hill. It raises real questions in the public mind about who's in charge here and who's being represented.&quot; Some ex-aides have returned to their old haunts to undo some of the tax provisions they helped put into the 1986 law. John Jonas, a former Democratic staffer with the House Ways and Means Committee who is now with the law firm of Patton, Boggs andamp; Blow, has lobbied on behalf of graduate schools to restore some of the favorable tax treatment the legislation removed from scholarships. And Kenneth Kies, a former GOP Ways and Means staffer now with the law firm of Baker andamp; Hostetler, has lobbied for an Ohio company to win an exception to the minimum-tax law that he helped devise.    More often, aides-turned-lobbyists function as staff-on-loan to former bosses, many times focusing on issues they dealt with when they were still on the congressional payroll. Richard Merski left the office of Rep. Richard Schulze (R., Pa.) shortly before the Tax Reform Act began to make its way through the House Ways and Means Committee in the fall of 1985. As a lobbyist for American International Group, an insurance-holding concern, he stays in touch with his old office.    &quot;Lobbyists are important as informational sources, and Rich has been very helpful,&quot; says Robert Hartwell, the aide who took over for Mr. Merski in 1985, and whom Mr. Merski recommended for his job. &quot;When I have a question or questions on insurance-tax provisions, I'll call Rich Merski and the Congressional Research Service, and I'll get a balanced view to give the congressman.&quot;    Becoming a lobbyist is increasingly part of the career plans of congressional staffers. Taking a job on Capitol Hill &quot;became more of a means to an end while I was there,&quot; agrees Carolyn Blaydes, a former tax aide to Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). &quot;People coming up {as staffers} see it as a way to move up, become a lobbyist and probably double their salary.&quot; Adds David Rayboy, former top tax aide to Sen. William Roth (R., Del.) and now a lobbyist with Patton, Boggs andamp; Blow: &quot;It's almost like an internship for a doctor. . . . It's a card you have to punch.&quot; Most of the congressional tax aides from the 1986-bill era who haven't become lobbyists still work in government.    The issue of the &quot;revolving door&quot; is hot these days. As part of the unfolding scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, former lawmakers and government officials are confessing to favor-seeking. And in Congress, bills are moving that would limit lobbying by former government aides.    It is difficult to pinpoint what effect, if any, such job-switching wreaks on the legislative process. One possible result, some say, is a more-complicated tax code. &quot;I'm not saying people consciously said, 'I'm going to make this thing as complicated as I can so they'll need me out there and pay me big bucks,'&quot; says Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D., Ind.). &quot;But that obviously is rich soil for further employment,&quot; he contends.    Former staffers also have a greater chance of being listened to, another major benefit to their corporate clients. &quot;They know you, and they return your phone calls,&quot; says Mary Beth Riordan, a lobbyist for the law firm Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPherson andamp; Hand, and a former aide to Rep. Raymond McGrath (R., N.Y.). &quot;It's definitely an advantage.&quot; Current and former staffers form a fraternity of sorts, a network of friendships, in which the common gossip is information about legislation -- a valuable commodity. &quot;You are part of the community,&quot; says Julie Rabinowitz, a lawyer with Groom andamp; Nordberg, who was a tax aide to Sen. Roth and to Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa).    &quot;It's really a very tiny world,&quot; adds Sharon Cranford, a former tax staffer to Rep. Frank Guarini (D., N.J.), who is now a tax analyst here with Coopers andamp; Lybrand, an accounting firm. &quot;We all have to be good because you never know where you'll be next.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
