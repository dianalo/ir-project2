McAuliff, a Seattle law firm, uses Wang Informatics'ProFound document manager on a Banyan network with three file servers and 150nodes, according to Linda Hance, systems manager.andM;&quot;We wanted to manage documents both on-line and off-line to provideredundancy and have files automatically archived locally,&quot; she said.andM;All of the firm's hard drives have WordPerfect, she added, and with thisarrangement, if the network goes down, all users can continue with theirwork.andM;Another reason the firm chose to adopt a document-management system wasbecause of the rapidly growing number of user directories as well as the needfor billing functions and full-text search, said Hance.andM;The firm evaluated six packages: ProFound, Syntrex Inc.'s DocumentManagement, CMS-Data Corp.'s PC DOCS, LAN Systems Inc.'s Reference Point,NCompass Software Inc.'s Workgroup and Interpreter Inc.'s DocumentAdministrator.andM;ProFound was chosen because of its ease of use, pull-down menus, andflexibility in accommodating the firm's current and future needs, said Hance.andM;&quot;The software closest in capabilities to ProFound was Syntrex's DocumentManagement, but the user interface was very complicated,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;With PCDOCS, the user had to call the document manager from within WordPerfect.andP;  Ithad a very complicated interface as well.andP;  I couldn't imagine our users usingit--they'd never make it.&quot;andM;Byron Jamison, an attorney with Jamison andamp; Harris P.C., in Houston, choseZylab Corp.'s ZyIndex for full-text retrieval on his Toshiba 5100 with a100M-byte counter drive.andM;&quot;It has eliminated the need to organize our files,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Now I justkeep my word-processing files in one huge subdirectory.&quot;andM;Before making his decision, Jamison examined several database systems.andP;  Hesaid he opted for a document-management system because of its flexibility inretrieving text.andP;  &quot;ZyIndex is very fast and very easy to use,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Themain thing I like is that it covers all our text-retrieval tasks.andP;  I have notfound any text it couldn't handle, and I can't say that about any otherretrieval package.&quot;andM;Hassel Parker, director of administration for Womble Carlyle Sandrige andamp; RiceP.C., a law firm in Winston-Salen, N.C., is also a document-managementadvocate.andM;&quot;Coming from a filing-cabinet mentality, where I could go in and pull out apiece of paper, I got scared knowing I had 50,000 pieces of paper I couldn'tsee and I might lose them,&quot; Parker said.andP;  &quot;Without a document-managementsystem, you could have real chaos.andP;  We were looking for the capability togive us redundancy in the most cost-effective way.&quot;andM;The firm chose PC DOCS for both its accounting and document-managementsystems which provided hooks to and from PC DOCS for billing, file retrievaland full-text searching.andM;The firm examined several options, but selected PC DOCS as the most efficientway to handle its thousands of documents.andM;Katherine De Bruyn, director of information services for the Seattle law firmPerkins Coie, wanted dynamic data exchange support to integrate Word forWindows.andP;  Her firm chose Saros Corp.'s File-Share (now called Mezzanine), andruns it on 10 386-based 33MHz Compaq servers with about 175 workstations.andM;Although FileShare does not provide full-text search, that feature was notvital, she said.andP;  &quot;It allows as many retrieval parameters as possible--keyword, title, number, date, data range, author, typist, department or documentnumber.&quot;andM;Transparent operation with Word for Windows as well as a multiuser searchability were important considerations for De Bruyn.andM;According to Hance of Heller, Ehrman, some of the benefits of adocument-management system include the ability to produce queries over a widearea network, automatically create document profiles, retrieve multipledocuments and give multiple users access to the same version of a document.andM;While the ability to conduct queries to remote networks is due in February1991 from Wang Informatics, ProFound provides flexibility in customizingfields names; in specifying creation by author, operator or department; andin performing extensive audit trails.andM;Jamison added that buyers should be aware of the search speed of varioussystems.andM;ZyIndex provides the user with consistent search and retrieval speeds from anXT to his 386-upgraded Toshiba 5100, although indexing a 300-page documentmay take anywhere from a minute to more than an hour on slower machines,Jamison said.andM;Ease of use is another important feature for Jamison.andP;  New users can betrained in 15 minutes, in part because his office uses Quarterdeck OfficeSystems' Desqview, a desktop environment that eliminates the need to switchfrom the word processor to ZyIndex, he said.andM;Although Zylab provides spreadsheet accommodation, the procedures are poorlydocumented, requiring calls to technical support, according to Jamison.andM;Womble, Carlyle's Parker said, &quot;With 30,000 documents, we're getting searchesbenchmarked in less than a second [with PC DOCs].andP;  It doesn't put muchtraffic on the network and doesn't bog it down.andP;  If the document on the harddisk and on the file server are the same, it'll retrieve the one off the hardinstead of off the file server.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
