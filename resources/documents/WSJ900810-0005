The $3 billion estimate doesn't factor in possible damageto U.S. ships and planes or the cost of ammunition andmissiles if actual fighting occurs.</LP><TEXT>   The largest part of the anticipated extra costs, accordingto Pentagon officials and congressional aides, involveshigher fuel prices the military must pay world-wide as aresult of increases in the price of crude oil. The jump incrude-oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is likely tomean nearly $2 billion in higher overall fuel costs for theU.S. armed forces by early next year, according to someinternal Pentagon estimates.   Unless world oil prices plummet -- which few people expect-- those extra costs will strain Pentagon budget accountsregardless of how long U.S. troops remain in Saudi Arabia.   In addition, it's likely to cost hundreds of millions ofdollars to move large numbers of troops, planes and spareparts to the Middle East, and then keep them there for anextended period.   The total price tag, of course, depends on the militarysituation on the ground. But according to budget analysts,the massive airlift and deployment of U.S. naval power in theregion entails huge extra fuel costs. Stepped-up air and seaoperations are bound to mean increased maintenance andlogistics costs.   Neither the military nor congressional committees havedeveloped detailed cost estimates, and senior Pentagonofficials have declined to comment on the matter. Butofficials note that the U.S. invasion of Panama earlier thisyear -- a much simpler and smaller operation that lasted onlya few weeks -- cost the Defense Department nearly $400million in extra operating and personnel costs.   In the short term, each of the armed forces will try tocope with the problem by cutting back on routine maintenance,purchases and other nonessential operating expenses. But ifthe military confrontation continues for several months, thePentagon either will have to ask Congress to approve asupplemental appropriations measure or give it greaterauthority to transfer funds among certain accounts.   As part of that strategy, the White House announcedyesterday that President Bush plans to partly exempt spendingon military personnel from any automatic spending cuts thatmight occur this fall.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Bush plansto shield only as much Pentagon spending as needed tomaintain U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. He said Mr. Bush andhis budget advisers, who conferred Wednesday night, stillaren't sure what the deployment will cost.   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, Mr. Bushmust decide by Wednesday whether to exempt some or allPentagon spending on uniformed personnel from the automaticspending cuts that will be triggered in October -- unlessCongress finds a way to reduce the deficit by $74 billion oralters the Gramm-Rudman statute.   Although the administration is preparing to impose about$84 billion in Gramm-Rudman spending cuts, many in Congressdoubt cuts of that size will be allowed to go into effectbecause they would be so disruptive to the government andeconomy.   If Pentagon personnel spending is protected, othermilitary spending would be cut more deeply under the law.Should personnel be exempted entirely, Pentagon spendingwould be cut by 34.9%, the White House budget officeestimated. Non-defense spending covered by the law would becut by 31.9%.</TEXT></DOC>
