Lyons</HL><DD> 04/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   In a landmark legal decision in Hartford, Conn., Judge Mortimer V. Trendquest ruled in favor of the unmarried plantiff, socialite beauty Muffy Huntington-Carruthers, in the bitterly contested &quot;surrogate husband&quot; case.    Judge Trendquest's ruling confirms Ms. Huntington-Carruthers's right to enjoy the company of &quot;Hubby F,&quot; the handsome, 42-year-old Bridgeport truck driver at the center of this tug-of-love battle between his &quot;legal&quot; wife and his &quot;social&quot; wife.    For an annual fee of $50,000, the contract between Hubby F's legal wife, Betty Lou Tresker, and Ms. Huntington-Carruthers, entitled Muffy to enjoy the company of Hubby F for the first six months of each calendar year. Mrs. Tresker initiated legal proceedings four months after Ms. Huntington-Carruthers first exercised her contractual right.    As she was swept from the courtroom by an ecstatic contingent from WISH (Women In favor of Surrogate Husbands), Ms. Huntington-Carruthers held an impromptu press conference on the steps of the courthouse before climbing into her Mercedes convertible. In a voice quivering with emotion, she told reporters, &quot;I am just so happy that it's all over now. This has been a terrible ordeal for all of us.&quot; Asked what her immediate plans were, Ms. Huntington-Carruthers replied, &quot;All I want to do now is get back to a normal life. A few weeks in Antigua with my 'husband,' Fritz, and then back home to Greenwich in time for the tennis season.&quot;    At Ms. Huntington-Carruthers' side was her attorney, Michael Jefferson III, who told reporters: &quot;We have witnessed a great victory for my client and for common sense. Judge Trendquest is right in accepting my argument that the surrogate contract was freely entered into by both parties and that its terms must be upheld.    &quot;With the increasing number of single women in our society, he is also right in saying that we need new legislation to protect their right to have a husband. This case has shown that many options are open to women who want a husband, but we need new laws that will define these options more clearly.&quot;    Meanwhile, tug-of-love hubby Jack Tresker has not been seen or heard from since he took refuge in a secret downtown motel, pending the outcome of the trial. Apart from his much-photographed good looks and his appetite for sauerkraut, little is known about Hubby F except that he is a proficient tennis player. Ms. Huntington-Carruthers affectionately nicknamed him &quot;Fritz&quot; because of his reported passion for sauerkraut, a taste Muffy and her Greenwich friends found both amusing and engaging. The whole country quickly came to know him as Hubby F when national attention focused on the legal complications surrounding this human drama of two women in love with the same man. He has maintained silence throughout the case and was unavailable for comment today.    Reached at her four-bedroom colonial in Bridgeport, Betty Lou Tresker received the news about Judge Trendquest's ruling with quiet dignity.    &quot;It all started out so beautifully,&quot; she said. &quot;The people at NASH (National Association for Surrogate Husbands) told me I was doing a wonderful thing. Life was so wonderful with Jack that I thought, 'Hey, wouldn't it be wonderful to help another person to experience the same feeling that she might never be able to, unless she has someone like Jack?'&quot;    Mrs. Tresker reflected, &quot;Muffy seemed like such a nice person. What with her work as a part-time real estate agent and her tennis and all, and her just not having time to find a husband, it just seemed like a perfect solution.    &quot;But the people at NASH never told me it would be like this. They never told me that my love for Jack would make it impossible for me to give him up for six months every year.&quot;    She dismissed as &quot;stupid lies&quot; allegations that she had entered into the contract for purely financial motives. &quot;I did it to help another human being. It was something I thought I could feel proud of. Hey, what can I say? I made a mistake.&quot;    Minutes after the trial, Walt Schnitzel, counsel for the defendant, commented: &quot;The trouble nowadays is that the country is sprouting individual rights like weeds. My right to do this, my right to do that. Where will it all end?    &quot;This is a new production, but it's an old play. What happens to the poor sucker whose so-called right to do something is not in her own best interest? She exercises her right through ignorance, greed, disinterest, misunderstanding, whatever. Does the law help her? Should we have a law to protect her from herself?&quot;    With a look that could curdle fresh milk at 50 paces, he growled at no one in particular, &quot;You bet your sweet Afton we're gonna appeal. We're gonna appeal for some new laws.&quot;    ---   Mr. Lyons is senior director of Spencer Stuart, an executive-search firm. </TEXT></DOC>
