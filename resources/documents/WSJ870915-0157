Bolger and associates.    The Bolger group, in a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it plans to seek shareholder consent for a special meeting in an effort to remove the current Cleveland-Cliffs board. The group also said it recently raised its stake in the iron ore concern to 920,940 shares, or 7.4% of shares outstanding. Besides iron ore, Cleveland-Cliffs also has timber, coal-mining and oil-drilling operations.    Cleveland-Cliffs shares closed yesterday at $21.125, up $1.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    In a letter to shareholders, M. Thomas Moore, Cleveland-Cliffs president and chief executive officer, said the Bolger group's &quot;stated intentions and suggestions&quot; aren't in the company's best interests. He urged shareholders against signing any proxy card from the dissident group until company management responds.    Last Friday, the Bolger group won a federal court order that restrains Cleveland-Cliffs temporarily from offering 4.6 million new common shares and from adopting a shareholder rights plan. A court hearing on the matter is scheduled for today in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J.    The Bolger group must win consent from holders of 25% of Cleveland-Cliffs' common and preferred shares outstanding to call a special shareholders meeting. </TEXT></DOC>
