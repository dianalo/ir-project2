A dramatic indication of that success came yesterday when Saudi Arabia, which is leading the OPEC effort, announced that its new oil minister, Hisham Nazer, will visit Moscow despite the conservative Arab kingdom's lack of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The announcement said the planned visit, the first by Mr. Nazer to Moscow, is within the context of OPEC's efforts to stabilize world oil prices.    The Saudi visit was announced in the capital of Riyadh yesterday as part of a three-nation tour by Mr. Nazer that will take him first to Egypt, then the Soviet Union and Norway.    Several Arab and Saudi sources ascertained that the choice of Mr. Nazer to visit the Soviet Union carries a pointed reminder to Washington. In the past it was always Kuwait that maintained ties to the Soviet Union on behalf of the conservative alliance of Arab oil producers known as the Gulf Cooperation Council, which consists of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.    In what was regarded as a gesture by Moscow toward the OPEC pricing plan, the Soviet Union two weeks ago said it will align the price of its exported oil with OPEC's goal of $18 a barrel. OPEC hopes to get a broader commitment from the Soviet Union, a major non-OPEC oil producer, to reign in output.    Sources said that OPEC business is only a cover for a visit meant to accomplish wider political goals, including forging new ties aimed at balancing the extensive relationship Saudi Arabia maintains with Washington.    &quot;It is part of a getting-to-know you process,&quot; said one well-placed official who asked not to be identified. &quot;Hisham is taking his wife and his senior aides . . . . (The Saudis) have been very unhappy with the Americans for a long time.&quot;    The move comes as Washington faces mounting anger in the Arab world, particularly from usually friendly nations such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, over its secret arms and intelligence dealings with Iran. &quot;Leaving aside oil matters, this is the first fallout from the Irangate scandal,&quot; said an Arab businessman with close ties to the Saudi oil minister. The businessman asked not to be identified.    OPEC's effort to boost prices received a ringing endorsement yesterday from Norway, which announced it was aligning itself with the cartel's decision to trim output about 7% until June. Norwegian petroleum minister Arne Oeien said the reduction will take effect next month, bringing the country's output to slightly over one million barrels a day.    In addition, Mexican and Venezuelan oil industry sources said Mexico, which recently temporarily trimmed its oil exports to support prices, is expected to stay below its current export ceiling of 1.5 million barrels daily for a considerable period.    Altogether, these developments represent a serious setback for the U.S. policy of promoting free-market oil pricing.    Washington has tried to persuade Norway, which is a member of the International Energy Agency, an energy-related alliance of Western industrialized nations and Japan, to refrain from cooperating with OPEC. But the labor government of Norway's Prime Minister Gro Harlemm Brundtland has reversed the previous conservative government's policy, moving steadily closer to the cartel.    Mr. Nazer, the Saudi minister, will visit Norway next week, according to the Saudi announcement. He will start his tour today in Egypt, whose oil minister, Abdelhadi Qandil, said in a telephone interview yesterday, &quot;We are beginning to see oil producers take charge of their pricing, and I hope to see a pickup in the whole industry soon.&quot;    For its part, Egypt, which has a production capacity that easily exceeds one million barrels a day, said it will keep its output at 850,000 barrels a day to cooperate with OPEC.    Meanwhile, late yesterday a British energy official said that country continues to be opposed to any cuts in its North Sea oil output, despite the Norwegian plan to reduce production.    After strong gains in recent days, spot prices for the benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, fell 10 cents, to $18.90 a barrel, as traders took profits. </TEXT></DOC>
