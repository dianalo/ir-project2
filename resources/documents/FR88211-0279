The petitioners,Zenith Electronics Corporation (``Zenith'') and the International Brotherhoodof Electrical Workers, Independent Radionic Workers of America, the InternationalUnion of Electronic, Electrical, Technical, Salaried andamp; Machine Workers,and the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO (``the Unions''), and tworespondents, Sanyo and Hitachi, requested in accordance with andSection;353.53a(a)of the Commerce Regulations that we conduct an administrative review. Wehave now completed the administrative review in accordance with section751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>Imports covered by the review are shipments of television receiving sets,monochrome and color, and include but are not limited to projection televisions,receiver monitors, and kits (containing all the parts necessary to receivea broadcast television signal and produce a video image). Not includedare certain monitors not capable of receiving a broadcast signal, certaincombination units (combinations of television receivers with other electricalentertainment components such as tape recorders, radio receivers, etc.),and certain subassemblies not containing the components essential for receivinga broadcast television signal and producing a video image. The review covers five manufacturers and/or exporters of Japanese televisionreceivers, monochrome and color, and generally the periods April 1, 1982through March 31, 1983 and March 1, 1985 through February 28, 1986. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. Wereceived comments from one of the petitioners, Zenith, and three respondents,NEC, Mitsubishi, and Fujitsu General. We received additional comments fromthe respondents concerning mathematical or clerical errors. We have correctedsuch errors but have not addressed them specifically in this notice. Analysis of Petitioner's Comments<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should have implementedthe ruling of the Court of International Trade (``CIT'') in <T3>Zenith </T3>v. <T3>United States </T3>(April 24, 1986) by adding to United States price(``USP'') the internal taxes rebated or forgiven upon the exportation ofthe merchandise to the extent that those taxes were ``passed through''and included in the price of televisions sold in Japan.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Court of International Trade issuedits final decision in <T3>Zenith </T3>on January 14, 1988. We do not agree with that decisionand, pending a final decision on whether the Government will appeal, weare continuing to assume that all indirect taxes in the home market arepassed through to the ultimate customers. We did not attempt to measurethe amount of tax ``passed through'' to customers in the Japanese marketfor several reasons. First, we do not agree that the statutory languagelimiting the amount of the adjustment to the amount of the commodity tax``added to or included in the price'' of televisions sold in Japan requiresthe Department to measure the incidence of the tax in an economic sense.Second, applying such an interpretation would be contrary to the obligationsof the United States under the GATT Dumping Code. Third, measuring theincidence of the commodity tax in Japan would be an enormous and extremelycomplex task. The Department simply lacks the resources, in terms of bothmanpower and expertise, to shoulder such a burden. We agree that the amount of commodity tax forgiven by reason of the exportof televisions to the United States must be added to USP under the statute.We calculated the adjustment by multiplying the ex-factory price by thetax rate and adding the result to USP. To avoid artificially inflatingor deflating margins, we made circumstances-of-sale adjustments, whereappropriate.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department improperly failedto deduct antidumping legal expenses from exporter's sales price (``ESP'').<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We do not agree that legal expenses associatedwith antidumping proceedings should be deducted from ESP. See our positionon <T3>Comment 3</T3> in <T3>Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, From Japan; Final Resultsof Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,</T3> 52 FR 8940, March 20, 1987.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Zenith contends that whenever merchandise subject toan antidumping finding is given away to a zero price, including samples,a margin must be calculated for the transaction.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree that goods entered for consumptionare subject to an antidumping finding whenever ownership transfers fromthe exporter of such goods.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department's policy of instructingCustoms to collect cash deposits for future entries on the basis of a weighted-averagepercentage of USP understates the amounts that should be collected becauseUSP will always be higher than entered values. Since the percentage calculatedon the basis of USP will subsequently be applied to the lower entered value,it will understate the true estimated duty. Zenith urges the Departmentto calculate the deposit rate as a percentage of entered value.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. See our position on <T3>Comment 7 </T3>in our previous final results notice (52 FR 8940, March20, 1987).<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department failed to accountfor interest income earned on deferred payments of rebates and discounts.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Unlike situations when an expense is inherentin a transaction (e.g., credit costs when payment is delayed) yet no sales-specificquantification of such cost exists in a company's records, in this situationan allocated sales-specific cost exists in the company's records. The Departmentavoids imputing expenses/costs where a company quantifies the actual expenses/costs,provides adequate documentation of those expenses, and the company's quantificationaccurately reflects the expense to the seller. Our examination of the rebateand/or discount system used by the Japanese manufacturers indicates a systemwhere the manufacturers paid rebates and/or discounts according to setschedules governed by contracts and/or purchase orders between the manufacturersand the customers. As such, the amount of the rebate/discount paid to thecustomer represents the allocated expense to the seller.<T3>Comment 6: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should delete fromNEC's home market sales data base certain home market sales at abnormallylow prices, as it did in its review of the prior period.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We examined the FMV's in questionand are satisfied that they were in the ordinary course of trade and inthe unusal commercial quantities.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Zenith urges the Department to deduct from USP theactual amount of estimated antidumping duties paid by the respondents.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We do not consider estimatedantidumping duties paid to be expenses related to the sales under consideration.In addition, adding these estimated duties to the dumping margins wouldartificially inflate them.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department must allocate FujitsuGeneral's home market advertising, sales promotion, and warranty expensesover the sales value of all purchaser categories.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Since this is our standard policy and practice,we agree and have made the appropriate corrections to our calculations.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>Zenith asserts that the Department improperly disregardednegative and corresponding positive sales in the United States.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>There were no negative quantities or valuesin the United States and home market sales listings. We note that for subsequentreviews we are requiring respondents to provide computer tapes net of,and a listing identifying, all negative and corresponding positive quantitiesand values in both markets.<T3>Comment 10: </T3>Zenith asserts that, in Mitsubishi's case, the Departmentimproperly matched a 45-inch export model and a 50-inch export model witha 72-inch home market model.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. For these two U.S. models forcomparison purposes we have used the home market model proposed by Mitsubishiand Zenith.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Zenith contends that Mitsubishi calculated home marketdata on packing and merchandise differences on a semiannual basis (April-September'85) for sales which occurrred in March '85, and urges the Department touse the data from the previous semiannual period (October '84-March '85)to calculate adjustments for March '85 sales. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have made the appropriatecorrections to our calculations. <T3>Comment 12: </T3>Zenith asserts that, in calculating a model-specifichome market advertising expense for Fujitsu General, we should divide theexpense by the total number of units sold for each model. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Our policy of allocating thisexpense to the total sales value of the home market comparison model resultsin a reasonable and accurate allocation. <T3>Comment 13: </T3>Zenith asserts that, because Fujitsu General failedto provide packing costs, the Department should use the lowest home marketpacking costs and the highest U.S. packing costs from the previous reviewperiod. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>As best information available we used FujitsuGeneral's actual, verified home market and U.S. packing costs from the5th review period. <T3>Comment 14: </T3>Zenith objects to the Department's recalculation of12-month expense data in the home market and urges the Department to usesix-month expense data provided by Fujitsu General. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Our policy of allocating expensesincurred during a review period to the value of all sales during the reviewperiod is reasonable and produces accurate results. <T3>Comment 15: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department failed to deductcertain home market and export inland freight expenses for Fujitsu General.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We verified that Fujitsu General couldnot segregate these costs and that these portions of inland freight expensesfor both markets were the same. <T3>Comment 16: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department may have incorrectlyincluded non-selling expenses as part of the ESP offset to FMV. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We confirmed that the ESP offset includesonly indirect selling expenses. <T3>Comment 17: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should identifythe direct and indirect components of U.S. commissions and should offsethome market indirect selling expenses up to the amount of only the indirectcomponent of U.S. commissions. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Respondents have demonstratedthat commissions paid to unrelated parties bear a direct relationship tothe sales under consideration. It is not necessary to examine how the commissionairespent the money; to the seller it is a direct expense, incurred only becausea particular sale was made. We have treated these expenses as direct circumstance-of-saleadjustments according to andSection; 353.15 of the regulations and, whereappropriate, have deducted indirect selling expenses in the market wherethere is no commission, up to the amount of the commission in the othermarket. <T3>Comment 18: </T3>Zenith argues that for Mitsubishi the Department imnproperlytreated as a direct expense certain home market inland freight costs fromthe factory to the Transportation Center. This expense was incurred beforethe date of sale and, therefore, should be treated only as an indirectselling expense. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have made the appropriatecorrections. <T3>Comment 19: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department incorrectly allowedas a direct expense Mitsubishi's home market warranty claim; this claimconsists entirely of labor expenses incurred by Mitsubishi's related servicecompany and should, therefore, be treated as an indirect expense. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have made the appropriatecorrections. <T3>Comment 20: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department incorrectly allowedthe freight-out expense of Mitsubishi's U.S. subsidiary (MESA) to be allocatedaccording to value; instead, movement expenses should be allocated accordingto sales volume. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>In calculating freight costs, we preferto calculate these expenses based on cubic volume or weight. However, sinceMESA does not maintain these records based on cubic volume or weight, weaccepted the allocation based on value as a reasonable alternative. <T3>Comment 21: </T3>Zenith claims that Mitsubishi failed to report theESP warranty expense for one export model and failed to report its ESPwarranty parts expenses on a model-specific basis.   <T3>Department's Position: </T3>As best information available in our finalcalculations we used the same warranty expense ratio for that one exportmodel that was used for other U.S. projection models. We agree that Mitsubishidid not report ESP warranty parts expenses on a model-specific basis; therefore,we allocated these expenses based on sales value as best information available.<T3>Comment 22: </T3>Zenith argues that Mitsubishi and NEC understatedtheir U.S. indirect selling expenses in their ESP responses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree in part. We are satisfied thatMitsubishi's method of allocating these expenses is accurate. However,we agree that NEC's allocation of indirect selling expenses was understatedand have revised our calculations using NEC's correct data.<T3>Comment 23: </T3>Zenith asserts that in its ESP calculations the Departmentfailed to deduct Fujitsu General's U.S. advertising expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have deducted these expensesin the applicable ESP calculations.<T3>Comment 24: </T3>Zenith urges the Department to delete from FujitsuGeneral's home market data base abnormally low home market prices whichwere due to data entry errors.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. We have deleted fromour calculations those transactions that showed a zero price.<T3>Comment 25: </T3>Zenith argues that in its ESP calculations the Departmentused an incorrect number of days to compute NEC's imputed financing costsand urges the Department to use the number of days supplied by NEC.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have recalculated this expenseaccordingly.<T3>Comment 26: </T3>Zenith objects that for NEC the Department incorrectlycalculated the FMV for one home market comparison model and the accompanyingremote control unit, because the Department improperly deducted certaincommodity tax, royalty, and insurance expenses twice.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have revised our calculationsaccordingly.<T3>Comment 27: </T3>Zenith urges the Department to change its calculationof NEC's export inland freight.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Zenith's proposal to modify our calculationof export inland freight would have an insignificant effect (a differenceof one yen per cubic foot); therefore, we have disregarded it.<T3>Comment 28: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should deduct fromUSP a commission paid by Fujitsu General to its related U.S. subsidiary,Teknika, for acting as the importer of record in certain purchase pricetransactions.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We consider payments to relatedparties to be mere intracorporate transfers of funds rather than commissions.there is no statutory or regulatory basis for deducting such payments frompurchase price.<T3>Comment 29: </T3>Zenith argues that for NEC the Department failed toinclude in its calculations six purchase price sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. We have checked our recordsand reviewed three additional purchase price sales for NEC. We reviewedthe other three sales in the previous review period.Analysis of Respondents' Comments<T3>Comment 30: </T3>Fujitsu General, Sanyo, NEC, and Mitsubishi arguethat the Department should have implemented the CIT's ruling in <T3>Zenith </T3>by adding to USP the amount of internal taxes forgivenor rebated upon the exportation of the merchandise. This would requirethe Department to add to USP an amount equal to the Japanese commoditytax that would have been imposed by the Japanese government upon the exportedmerchandise had it not been exported.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>See our position on <T3>Comment 1</T3>.<T3>Comment 31: </T3>NEC and Fujitsu General argue that in the settlementagreements signed on April 28, 1980 by the Department and 22 importers,the Department agreed to ascertain statutory FMV precisely as it had inthe past, that is, to use ``traditional methodology'' in calculating homemarket advertising, sales promotion, and warranty expenses, and that theDepartment is obligated thereby to use the so-called ``traditional methodology''in this review.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> See our position on <T3>Comment 28</T3> in our previous final results notice (52 FR 8943, March20, 1987).<T3>Comment 32:</T3> Fujitsu General and NEC argue that the Departmentshould have used a six-month weighted-average home market price to calculateFMV.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. See our position on <T3>Comment 29</T3> in our previous final results notice (52 FR 8943, March20, 1987).<T3>Comment 33:</T3> NEC asserts that the Department should have basedFMV on sales in the ``principal markets,'' rather than in all markets inJapan.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. In calculating FMV our policyis to use all home market sales of such and similar merchandise that arein the ordinary course of trade and in the usual commercial quantities.NEC furnished no evidence to support its assertion that its principal marketswere less than all markets in Japan.<T3>Comment 34:</T3> NEC asserts that the Department violated the AdministrativeProcedures Act by retroactively applying new practices to the 4th reviewperiod.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. These reviews are not subjectto the Administrative Procedures Act. As we have stated elsewhere, we neednot apply changes in methodology only on a ``prospective'' basis (<T3>see </T3>our position on <T3>Comment 1</T3> in the <T3>Final Determination of sales at Less Than Fair Value; Color televisionsfrom Korea, </T3>49 FR 7620, March 1, 1984).<T3>Comment 35:</T3> NEC asserts that the Department improperly deniedan adjustment by not deducting from FMV the profit, selling, general, andadministrative expenses incurred by its sales companies.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree in part. We do not adjust foreignmarket value to account for sales companies' profits. Furthermore, NECdid not demonstrate that the claimed selling expenses were related solelyto the sales of comparison models. We do, however, consider these expensesindirectly-related selling expenses. Therefore, we included them in theESP offset and allocated them to the total sales value of all televisionssold in the home market during the period.<T3>Comment 36:</T3> NEC asserts that the Department improperly disallowedNEC's home market advertising and sales promotion expenses. NEC adds thatthe Department should at least allow certain portions of these claimedexpenses.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. We disallowed the claimedadjustments, as either direct or indirect selling expenses, because theycould not be satisfactorily verified.For advertising and sales promotion expenses we proceeded as follows inthis review. When a respondent claimed a larger amount than the samplewe verified, we allowed the verified sample amount. When the claimed amountwas equal to or less than the verified sample amount, we allowed the claimedamount. (We did not use the verified sample amounts in these instancesrespondents should not benefit from their unwillingness to provide completeresponses.) Finally, when we were unable to verify the sample amount, wedenied the claimed amount in its entirety.<T3>Comment 37:</T3> NEC argues that the Department incorrectly disallowedthe labor portion of its warrantly and that we should allow NEC's five-yearmodel-specific warranty data or NEC's one-year product line data.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have allowed only the model-specificwarranty expense for parts costs as a directly-related selling expense,because we consider the labor portion performed by NEC's related servicecompany to be a fixed cost, not directly related to the sales in this period.However, we have allowed this labor expense as an indirectly-related sellingexpense and included it in the ESP offset.<T3>Comment 38:</T3> NEC argues that the Department failed to deduct homemarket inland freight expenses.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Because we could not satisfactorily verifythe home market inland freight expenses, we disallowed the claim.<T3>Comment 39:</T3> Fujitsu General argues that the Department erred inimputing financing costs for U.S. sales from the date of export to thedate of sale.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. We impute an interest expensefor the period between the date of shipment from Japan and the date ofsale in the U.S. because the opportunity cost of holding inventory is areal expense which Fujitsu General could not identify in its pool of claimedinterest expenses.<T3>Comment 40:</T3> Fujitsu General argues that the Department failedto account for imputed financing costs in the home market and urges theDepartment to calculate these costs from production date to sales dateto unrelated customers.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We did not make any adjustment for FujitsuGeneral in this case because it did not provide the necessary data to calculatethe appropriate imputed financing costs.<T3>Comment 41:</T3> Fujitsu General discovered several data input errorsin the computer tape for Teknika's ESP sales and urges the Department toaccept a new corrected computer tape.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Rather than accepting a new tape, we correctedthe existing tape for these errors.<T3>Comment 42:</T3> Fujitsu General asserts that in its calculation ofFMV the Department should not have used sales to farmer cooperatives andsmall stores. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. We have no evidence that anyof these sales were not in the ordinary course of trade or not in the usualcommercial quantities.<T3>Comment 43:</T3> Fujitsu General asserts that the Department improperlydenied as direct expenses certain warranty expenses, portions of advertising,and sales promotions.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disallowed portions of warranty andsales promotion expenses as direct expenses because Fujitsu General couldnot establish that these expenses were directly related to the sales underconsideration. Instead, we allowed them in the ESP offset as indirect expenses.We disallowed portions of home market advertising expenses altogether becausewe could not satisfactorily verify these claims.<T3>Comment 44:</T3> Fujitsu General asserts that the Department improperlytreated certain purchase price sales as ESP transactions.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In its original questionnaire responseFujitsu General indicated that these sales occurred after the dates ofimportation. Therefore, in the preliminary results of review we treatedthese sales as ESP transactions. Fujitsu General has since proven thatthese sales occurred before the dates of importation. We are satisfiedthat these were purchase price transactions and have treated them as suchin our final calculations.<T3>Comment 45:</T3> Fujitsu General argues that we incorrectly disallowedits trade credit and market rebate (``TMCR'') claim as a circumstance-of-saleadjustment directly attributable to color television sales and other products.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. The TMCR is a rebate and weallowed the company-supplied model-specific portions of this claimed adjustmentbut we disallowed those portions not shown to be related to sales usedfor comparison purposes.<T3>Comment 46:</T3> Fujitsu General argues that the Department incorrectlydisallowed portions of its sales promotion expenses which were allocatedto color television receivers and color televisions/other products.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Fujitsu General did not establish thatthese expenses were directly related to sales being reviewed; however,we allowed them as indirectly-related selling expenses in our ESP offsetcalculation. <T3>Comment 47:</T3> Fujitsu General claims that the Department shoulddeduct packing costs for each model from claimed differences in merchandise.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree and have revised our calculationsaccordingly. We used Fujitsu General's actual, verified packing costs fromthe previous period as best information available and deducted these costsfrom the claimed merchandise differences for each television model.<T3>Comment 48:</T3> Fujitsu General argues that the Department incorrectlydisallowed as directly related expenses its home market warranty expensesincurred in-house and through independent retail stores and service outlets.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Fujitsu General did not report the homemarket warranty expense data as requested in our questionnaire. In addition,we could not satisfactorily verify that the referenced home market warrantyexpense data were directly related expenses. Therefore, we allocated themto the relative sales value of television receivers and considered themas indirect expenses.<T3>Comment 49:</T3> Fujitsu General requests an additional adjustmentfor home market indirect selling expenses to be included in the ESP offset,specifically, for the Domestic Marketing Group in the Domestic Sales Division.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Fujitsu General first make this claim inits pre-hearing brief; this was too late in the review to be consideredor verified.<T3>Comment 50:</T3> Fujitsu General argues that the Department shouldcalculate imputed financing costs and export selling expenses on the basisof the F.O.B. price to Teknika rather than the resale price by Teknika.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. We imputed an interestexpense from the date of shipment in Japan to the date of importation basedon Fujitsu General's F.O.B. price to Teknika. However, we imputed financingcosts from the date of importation to the date of shipment to the unrelatedU.S. customer based on Teknika's price to unrelated U.S. customers. Weagree that we should calculate export selling expenses on the basis ofthe F.O.B. price and have corrected our calculations accordingly.<T3>Comment 51</T3>: Fujitsu General argues that the Department incorrectlydeducted from ESP certain expenses for accommodation sales; instead, FujitsuGeneral argues that these expenses are not incurred for accommodation salesand, therefore, should not be deducted from ESP.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Fujitsu General reported theseexpenses in its computer printout and gave no indication in its ESP responsethat certain expenses should not be deducted from accommodation sales.<T3>Comment 52: </T3>Mitsubishi asserts that the Department improperlydisallowed newspaper advertising expenses for March 1986 which were incurredwithin its fiscal year (April '85-March '86). Mitsubishi also asserts thatexclusion of these expenses is inconsistent with the allowance of otherexpenses which were claimed on a fiscal-year basis.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: Due to Mitsubishi's unique advertisingstrategy for this model, and because the Department altered the periodexamined, we have used Mitsubishi's advertising experience from the previousperiod as the best information available.<T3>Comment 53: </T3>Mitsubishi argues that the Department incorrectlytreated MESA's volume rebate as a direct expense; instead, it should betreated as an indirect expense.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We disagree. Since we consider such rebatesas adjustments to price, we deducted them accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of the Review</ITAG>As a result of the comments received, we have revised our preliminary resultsand for appraisement purposes margins range from 0 to 71.92 percent, 0to 46.14 percent, and 0 to 34.21 percent for Fujitsu General, Mitsubishi,and NEC, respectively. Also, cash deposit rates are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,9,7</C> <H1>Manufacturer/exporter</H1><H1>Time period</H1><H1>Cash deposit (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Sanyo<D>3/85-2/86</D><D>\1\ 2.86</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hitachi<D>3/85-2/86</D><D>0.16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fujitsu General<D>3/85-2/86</D><D>4.06</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mitsubishi Electric<D>3/85-2/86</D><D>1.35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nippon Electric Co.<D>4/82-3/83</D><D>16.32</D><F>\1\ No shipments during the period; rate from last review in which therewere shipments.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries.

Since the cash deposit for Hitachi is less than 0.5 percent, andtherefore, <T3>de minimis </T3>for cash deposit purposes, the Department shall notrequire a cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties for Hitachi. Forany shipments from Mitsushita, Victor, Toshiba, or Sharp the cash depositwill continue to be at the rate published in the final results of the lastadministrative reviews for each of these firms (46 FR 30163, June 5, 1981and 50 FR 24278, June 10, 1985).For any shipments from a new exporter, not covered in this or prior administrativereviews, whose first shipments of Japanese television receivers, monochromeor color, occurred after February 28, 1986, and who is unrelated to anyreviewed firm or any previously reviewed firm, a cash deposit of 4.06 percentshall be required.
