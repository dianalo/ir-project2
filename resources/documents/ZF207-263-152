Hardy, the academy said the SMP had&quot;significantly improved&quot; the agency's ability to perform its mission butthere were still a few &quot;areas to explore,&quot; said SSA spokesman FrankBattistelli.andM;SSA has viewed the findings as &quot;accelerated advice,&quot; because the NationalAcademy of Sciences will deliver a more formal report in September,Battistelli said.andM;The preliminary report recommended that SSA look into alternative backupprocedures, Battistelli said.andP;  SSA maintains off-site backups of all itsNational Computer Center software and master files.andP;  A commercial facilityand another federal agency provide backup services, SSA officials said.andM;In addition, SSA has a $2 million uninterruptible power supply and three jetturbines that serve as emergency generators, Battistelli said.andM;Yet the National Academy of Sciences suggested that SSA consider otheralternatives for protecting itself from processing disruptions.andM;&quot;There are a few other alternatives.andP;  We could work more closely with anotherADP center or we could distribute the load among several information centers&quot;to reduce the load on the National Computer Center, Battistelli said.andM;The academy's letter backed SSA's recent claims that it needs more computercapacity to support its new systems and automated services such as itsmodernized claims system, personal earnings and benefits statements system,and a modernized enumeration system that allows SSA staff to take SocialSecurity card applications on line.andM;New software exists for these and other systems,but it can run only in pilotmode due to insufficient hardware capacity, Battistelli said.andM;The review acknowledged that SSA has &quot;significant short-term capacity needs,&quot;and that SSA officials should go ahead with the hardware procurements theyhave planned, Battistelli said.andM;SSA contracted with the National Academy of Sciences last year to review theSMP's progress.andP;  The review covers 1982 to 1989, Battistelli said.andP;  SSA's&quot;service and information technology areas reflect improvement in a periodwhen the workload increased and the staffing decreased,&quot; the academy reviewsaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
