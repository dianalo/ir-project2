Unconfirmed reports said both wereshot.   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the deaths, whichfollow a series of retaliatory slayings by Protestant and RomanCatholic extremists.   On Sunday, gunmen stormed a Belfast home and killed a man whilehe said his prayers with his wife.   Eamonn Mallie, a reporter for Downtown Radio in Belfast, said theslain officers were a constabulary divisional commander and hisdeputy. The constabulary said only that both victims werehigh-ranking officers, and there was no immediate report on thecause of death.   The constabulary said the car was found near Jonesborough, justinside the British province of Northern Ireland. The area was sealedoff and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troopsmoved in.   Seamus Mallon, an opposition member of Parliament from NorthernIreland, said the deaths of the two officers were ``a calculated andbrutal act of slaughter carried out by people for whom murder hasbecome a way of life.''   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King pledged that the securityforces would take ``every possible step'' to combat the wave ofretaliatory murders.   King, the British Cabinet minister responsible for NorthernIreland, discussed the violence Monday with deputy police chiefMichael McAtamney of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.   ``What the RUC and all the security forces need at this time isthe full support of the whole community in a total rejection ofviolence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against theseevil groups,'' he said afterwards.   David Braniff, 63 and a father of 13, was shot dead in his northBelfast home Sunday night. Neighbors said two gunmen burst intoBraniff's house and shot him at point-blank range. They said he diedwith his rosary in his hands.   Police appealed to the public to help find Braniff's killers. Nogroup immediately claimed responsibility.   Braniff, a Catholic, was a bricklayer who had been a Protestantbefore he married. He had British flags tattooed on his arms andworked in Protestant areas of Belfast.   On Friday, Catholic civil servant Niall Davies, 42, was shot inhis home, apparently in retaliation for the IRA killing the previousnight of Jackie Irvine, 49, a former commander of the Protestantparamilitary Ulster Volunteer Force.   The latest round of killings began Feb. 12 when Catholic attorneyPatrick Finucane was shot in his home. The Protestant undergroundUlster Freedom Fighters said they killed him because he was an IRAofficer. His widow denied it.   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule inNorthern Ireland and unite the province with the Catholic IrishRepublic to the south, while the Protestant majority wants to remainunder the British flag.</TEXT></DOC>
