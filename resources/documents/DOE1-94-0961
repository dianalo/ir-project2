Studies are discussed in which it wasdemonstrated that the structured hydration layer (around coal particles)formed by nonionic surfactants is destroyed at high temperatures. Otherstudies are mentioned which describe the relative importance of hydrodynamic,attractive and repulsive forces and provide examples of flocculationinstabilities, due to shearing flow, in agitated slurries. An overviewis also presented of CWS preparation tests conducted, between 1983 and1988, in various locations in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
