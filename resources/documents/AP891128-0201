RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a dispute stemming fromthe 1981 settlement of the Iran hostage crisis, ruled today thatAmerican companies recovering money from Iran must pay a portion tothe U.S. government.   By a 9-0 vote, the justices upheld a 1985 law requiringcompanies that win claims against Iran before a specialinternational tribunal to pay 1.5 percent of the first $5 millionrecovered and 1 percent of the excess to the U.S. government.   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said the moneypaid to the federal treasury is a reasonable ``user fee'' intendedto reimburse the government for its costs. Also, he said, UnitedStates participation in the international tribunal assures thecompanies they will collect money owed them by Iran.   White rejected arguments by Sperry Corp. that forcing companiesto pay the fees is an unconstitutional confiscation of theirproperty and that any costs to the government should be borne bythe nation as a whole.   ``As we see it, Sperry has not identified any of its propertythat was taken without just compensation,'' he said.   The Bush administration said tens of millions of dollars were atstake, including some $12.7 million already deducted by the U.S.government from claims paid to companies.   The financial deal that freed the 52 American hostages from Iranincluded the release by the U.S. government of billions of dollarsin frozen Iranian assets. Also, the settlement set up a processpermitting those with claims against Iran to take them to aninternational tribunal.   The Supreme Court in 1981 upheld the power of former PresidentJimmy Carter to approve the settlement, and that was not at issuein today's ruling.   Sperry Corp., which leased computer systems to Iran before the1979 hostage crisis severed relations between the United States andthat country, was awarded $2.8 million by the tribunal set up tohandle claims after the hostages were freed.   Sperry was ordered to pay the U.S. government $42,000 for whatthe government said was U.S. expenses in helping resolve thecompany's claim against Iran.   A federal appeals court here ruled in 1988 that the fee is anunconstitutional seizure of private property by the government.   In overruling the appeals court, White said, ``This court hasnever held that the amount of a user fee must be preciselycalibrated to the use that a party makes of government services.Nor does the government need to record invoices and billable hoursto justify the costs of its services.''   Today's ruling is not related directly to recent developmentssuggesting easing of tensions between Iran and the United States.   The Bush administration announced three weeks ago that theUnited States is returning $567 million in frozen assets to Iran, amove Prsident Bush said he hopes will prompt Tehran to push forfreedom for American hostages in Lebanon.   The $567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims byAmerican banks against Iran.   The case is U.S. vs. Sperry Corp., 88-952.   Meanwhile, in an unrelated case, the court ruled by a 9-0 votethat a federal law aimed primarily at compensating injureddockworkers also applies to railroad employees who clean and repairdockside locading equipment.   It ruled that three injured railroad workers from Virginia arelimited to receiving benefits under the Longshoremen's and HarborWorkers' Compensation Act. They had sought potentially greatercompensation under a disability law covering the railroad industry,the Federal Employers' Liability Act.   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said the workerswere covered by the longshoremens act because their jobs were``essential to the loading process.''</TEXT></DOC>
