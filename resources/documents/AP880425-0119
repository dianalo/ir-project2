Jackson set off the exchange Sunday when he said, ``I've raisedthe point in several debates this year. Every time a question comesup about terrorism, Mr. Dukakis says, `I'm against terrorism. ...We should not negotiate with terrorists. ... In the Middle East,never negotiate with terrorists.'   ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd doit.''   Dukakis, in Pennsylvania, told reporters today after being askedabout Jackson's statement, ``I think we need a tough anti-terroristpolicy. ...   ``I don't have a problem with talking, but you never makeconcessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up withis hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.''   Jackson, asked today about negotiating with terrorists, said hewould not make ``material concessions'' to them but could conceiveof situations in which he would grant hostage-takers safe passage.   ``I would never exchange arms for hostages,'' he said, areference to the Iran-Contra operations steered by Reaganadministration officials.   U.S. policy holds that American officials ``will talk to anyofficial or group about the safety and release of hostages but wewill not make concessions,'' a State Department spokesman saidtoday.   The gentle battling between the surviving Democratic candidatesgot more direct as the candidates closed in on Tuesday'sdelegate-rich Pennsylvania primary.   A new poll, sponsored by Philadelphia's KYW-TV and Pittsburgh'sKDKA-TV, showed Dukakis apparently increasing his lead among likelyPennsylvania Democratic voters. In the new poll, taken by telephoneover the weekend, Dukakis led Jackson 57 percent to 31 percent with12 percent still undecided.   Last week, with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. still being counted,Dukakis led Jackson 45 percent to 34 percent, with 14 percentundecided and 7 percent for Gore. The polls, with a margin of errorof five percentage points either way, were conducted by KRCResearch of Cambridge, Mass.   It was Jackson who has stirred the biggest controversy in recentdays with his call on Sunday for negotiation with anyone to freehostages.   ``In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set uppreconditions that stop effectiveness,'' Jackson said at a rally inWashington. ``I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get thehostages out of Beirut.''   Eight Americans are currently held hostage by Moslem extremistsin Beirut.   On Sunday, Dukakis did a whistle-stop tour of Pennsylvania, buthe was switching to the air today, hitting six cities to make animpression in every media market in the state before the voters goto the polls Tuesday.   Jackson raised money in Washington before returning late Sundayfor a final push in the Keystone State.   Dukakis has a big lead in the polls in Pennsylvania, where 178delegates are at stake. The complicated process _ with delegateselected individually _ offers a challenge to voters who may have topull the lever up to 12 times. But it also offers Dukakis, if hedoes well, a chance to win as many as 100 more delegates thanJackson.   ``You've got to vote more than once. This is the one time youcan do so legally,'' he told students at Penn State University inState College. ``Vote early and often _ vote for me and vote for mydelegates.''   Dukakis is more than half the way to a delegate majority,holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. Jackson has 836.1 while599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to winthe nomination at the July convention in Atlanta.   Guam's three convention votes entered the uncommitted columnSunday evening following caucuses on the Pacific island.   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush is virtuallyunchallenged on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, when he may win enough ofthe 78 delegates at stake to go over the magic majority mark _1,139 _ needed to win the GOP nomination in New Orleans in August.   A new poll by Time magazine indicates that a Dukakis-Jacksonticket would get 47 percent of the vote nationwide to 42 percentfor a Republican ticket headed by Bush.   A Dukakis-Gore ticket would defeat Bush 49 percent to 39percent, but Bush would defeat Jackson by 52 percent to 34 percent,according to the poll released Sunday.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis and Jackson have been unusuallycordial recently, but the best-friends atmosphere thinned whenJackson urged Dukakis to release a proposed budget.   ``I'm not just for Head Start, I'm willing to pay for HeadStart,'' Jackson said during the debate Saturday night inPittsburgh. ``I have put numbers together to pay for my dreams.''   Dukakis strongly disagreed.   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that'sabsurd,'' he told reporters Sunday on his chartered Amtrak train,nicknamed the ``Pennsylvania Presidential Unlimited.''   ``I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done thatin great detail,'' Dukakis said as he toured western Pennsylvania.</TEXT></DOC>
