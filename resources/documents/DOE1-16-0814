After separation,the ions (such as Fe(III), Ca(II), Mg(II), Al(III) in 150 mg; U(VI),SO/sub 4//sup 2-/, PO/sub 4//sup 3-/ in 100 mg; Co(II), Ni(II) in 40mg; Bi(II), Sr(II), Mn(II), Hg(II) in 30 mg; Pb(II) in 25 mg; Zn(II),V(V), Cr(VI), Sn(II) in 20 mg; Ti(IV), Cu(II), B(III), Y(III), La(III),Ce(IV), Cl, Mo(VI) in 10 mg; Bi(III), Zr(IV) in 5 mg; As(V), Ag(I), Nb(V)in 2 mg and F/sup -/ in 1 mg) do not interfere the determination of 10{mu}g thorium with amino-G acid chlorophosphonazo and cetylpyridine bromide.This method is effective in separation, highly sensitive, simple andrapid. It is applied to determine Th in the range of 0.n-0.000n%. Therelative standard deviation is not more than +-10% (n = 3) and the additiverecovery is 95-103%. The described method is suitable for determinationof microamount of thorium in rocks and ores.</TEXT></DOC>
