For the first time in a presidency that had earmarked $2trillion for defense, Reagan proposed significant cuts to Americantroop strength _ a drop of 34,000 men and women or 1.56 percent. Hepostponed, perhaps killed, such longstanding goals as providing theNavy a 600-ship fleet.   He called for retiring hundreds of helicopters and more than adozen ships sooner than expected, urged Congress to give up ondevelopment of the mobile Midgetman nuclear missile and abandonedthe ASAT satellite-killing rocket. Navy blimps, Army drones and AirForce spy planes also fell victim to his budget ax.   All told, Reagan asked for budget authority totaling $299.5billion for military programs, of which $294 billion would actuallybe paid out during the year starting Oct. 1.   The fiscal 1989 totals represented increases from the $291.4billion in budget authority and $285.4 billion in outlays set forthis year _ but not enough to compensate for inflation, thepresident said.   Unlike past years, the administration already had agreed withCongress on the totals for military spending. That was done lastNovember in a deal to reduce the national deficit, when the WhiteHouse agreed to accept $299.5 billion in budget authority insteadof the $332.4 billion it really wanted.   Unveiled Thursday, then, were the details of how theadministration had scaled back to reach the new targets. DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci described the changes as painful andrisky, but done to a clear set of priorities that emphasizedquality over quantity.   ``We've made the hard choices here,'' he said at a Pentagonbriefing. ``We have traded off a smaller force in order to maintaina quality force.''   To illustrate what he meant, Carlucci cited a request to providemilitary personnel a 4.3 percent pay raise next year instead of the2 percent planned for civilian workers; a small increase inspending for operations and maintenance to ensure adequate trainingand deployment schedules; and continued production of existingmodern weapons such as the M-1A1 tank and the AH-64 Apachehelicopter.   In dividing up the 26.1 percent of federal outlays that would goto defense in fiscal 1989, Carlucci said the administration wouldnot abandon certain longstanding priorities.   For example, the Pentagon wants $4.55 billion for the Star Warsmissile defense system, compared with $3.55 billion this year. Anadditional $402 million is being sought for Energy Department workon Star Wars.   The Pentagon is also asking to continue work on a rail-mobileversion of the MX missile, and is requesting $1.4 billion foranother Trident nuclear submarine, Carlucci said.   On the other hand, the combined active-duty roster of the Army,Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps will be reduced gradually thisyear from 2,172,000 to 2,138,000 and then held at that levelthroughout fiscal 1989, Carlucci said.   The Air Force will be hit the hardest, giving up about 23,000jobs toward the total 34,000 being cut.   The Army will deactivate a motorized infantry brigade at FortLewis, Wash., and cancel the scheduled activation of two lightinfantry battalions in Alaska. The Navy will scrap plans toestablish a 14th air wing at the Miramar, Calif., Naval Air Stationand retire 16 frigates and one submarine it wanted to keep. The AirForce will deactivate two fighter wings and start deactivating athird.   In other moves, Carlucci and Pentagon comptroller Robert Helmsaid:</TEXT><TEXT>   _The Army will retire 450 Vietnam-era utility helicopters and170 scout copters; cancel the Aquila surveillance drone program andstop production of Copperhead laser-guided artillery shells; canceldevelopment of the Anti-Tactical Missile and develop only one newlight helicopter instead of two.   _The Navy will give up its goal of reaching a 600-ship fleet infiscal 1989, settling for 580. If Congress and the nextadministration agree, the Navy might hit the 600-ship level infiscal 1992. The Navy also will kill its new blimp program andcancel development of a new model of the Intruder attack jet, theA-6F.   _The Air Force will deactivate the 474th Tactical Fighter Wingat Nellis Air Force Base and one other _ either the 401st Air Wingnow in Spain or another one if a new European home is found for the401st. It will reduce its operation of SR-71 surveillance jets,relying more on satellites; cancel development of the ASATsatellite-killer rocket, and place the space shuttle launch sectionof Vandenberg Air Force Base into ``mothball'' status.   Carlucci said he was recommending to Congress that it killdevelopment of the single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile, butwas requesting $200 million for the program next year to keep themissile alive long enough for the next administration to decide itsfate.   Because of the budget environment, Carlucci said he had directedthe services to change their planning guidelines for the four yearsafter fiscal 1989 to assume after-inflation increases of 2 percentinstead of 3 percent.   Such growth will be the minimum necessary to reverse four yearsof lower-than-inflation increases, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
