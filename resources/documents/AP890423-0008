An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the kingand his entourage arrived in the capital after dawn following atrip to the United States.   No rioting was reported on Saturday or Sunday following fourdays of unrest in which at least eight people were killed and 83injured in more than a dozen towns and villages.   But security forces kept up heavy patrols in Salt, Maan, Kerak,Mazar and other cities where rioters attacked government buildingsand battled police last week.   The only significant demonstration on Saturday was at theUniversity of Jordan in Amman, where about 300 students peacefullymarched to express solidarity with rioters.   Students chanted ``Down With Zaid Rifai,'' the prime minister,who is blamed for the austerity measures. Witnesses said they alsochanted ``Long Live King Hussein.''   Rioters throughout Jordan have expressed support for Husseinwhile demanding Rifai's resignation.   On Friday, several hundred rioters in nearby Salt smashed bankfronts, looted a finance company, demolished police cars and peltedofficers with rocks, according to residents and security officials.   ``The situation now, knock on wood, is calm,'' Crown PrinceHassan told reporters at the royal palace on Saturday.   Hussei canceled a trip to Britain to speed his return home.   The king, interviewed on Cable News Network by syndicatedcolumnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak on Saturday, blamed theunrest on economic problems caused by the failure of other Arabnations to come through with promised aid to Jordan.   ``The underlying causes are the reality of foreign debt incurredand equivalent to commitments made by certain Arab states,'' hesaid, citing Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulfnations.   Hussein said the austerity that resulted ``is not easy forJordanians,'' but that his countrymen ``are certainly determined tostand in the future, stand on our own feet.''   The price rises were mandated by an International Monetary Fundagreement under which Jordan is rescheduling its $6 billion foreigndebt. They came after more than a year of economic problems causedby declining foreign income.   In Jerusalem, an Israeli government official said Saturday thatauthorities there were concerned about the disturbances inneighboring Jordan.   ``I don't think there is an immediate danger to Israel, but wehave a general interest that Jordan should be stable,'' he said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``King Hussein is a plausible partner for peace,'' he added.``It's safer to keep what we have and what we know. Instableregimes in this region have more of a tendency towardbelligerency.''   But Israeli right-wing politicians have argued that thereplacement of Hussein by a Palestinian leader would benefitIsrael. Palestinians constitute about half of Jordan's population.   They have said Jordan could then become a true Palestinian stateand thus solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination withoutIsrael having to make territorial concessions.   West Bank Palestinians, meanwhile, called on their brethren inJordan to avoid the disturbances.   ``We are concerned that any problems in Jordan might divertattention from the main issues of the Palestinian conflict,'' saidSaid Kanaan, a prominent PLO supporter and businessman from Nablus.   The riots mark the worst civil unrest since the Jordanian armycrushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1970-71. At the time, Israelitroops were deployed along the border, prepared to intervene in thefighting if necessary.</TEXT></DOC>
