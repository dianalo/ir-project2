In general, the U.S. agency finds violations of the anti-dumping act if exports are sold at prices below the home-market price for the same goods. The difference, defined as the dumping margin, determines the amount of anti-dumping duties that will be imposed if the U.S. International Trade Commission separately determines that the imports are injuring a domestic industry.    Pending the outcome of the case, U.S. importers will be required to post bonds or cash deposits to cover possible penalty duties.    The department said dumping margins on the color picture tubes from Singapore and Canada were relatively slight, but it concluded they were considerably wider for imports from Japan and South Korea.    Margins on the imports from Japan ranged from 1.62% for Mitsubishi Electric Corp. to 13.14% for Hitachi Ltd., 27.02% for Matsushita Electronics Corp., and 33.22% for Toshiba Corp. The margin for Samsung Electron Devices Co. and all other South Korean companies was 11.27%.    The Commerce Department said the imports of the picture tubes from all four countries totaled about $104.6 million in 1986, with more than half of such shipments coming from South Korea.    The anti-dumping inquiries also cover imports of color-picture tubes shipped to the U.S. in partially assembled TV receiver assemblies or kits. Such kit imports totaled $86.9 million from Japan and $31.1 million from Singapore in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
