LAUREL, N.J.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tyco Toys Inc. said it won a federal appeals court case against Interlego AG over the right to make children's building blocks.    It is the second case Lego Systems AS, the parent company of Interlego, has lost against Tyco.    Last month, Hong Kong's highest court ruled in Tyco's favor in a copyright infringement suit filed by Lego. &quot;Clearly, the courts will not allow Lego to unfairly preclude Tyco from competing with Lego,&quot; said Richard E. Grey, Tyco president.    Officials for Denmark-based Lego couldn't be reached for comment.    The appeals court affirmed a lower court decision, which found Tyco Super Blocks didn't violate Interlego's trademark.    Since 1984, Tyco has been selling deliberate copies of Lego's snap-together plastic blocks for about 25% less than Lego. Tyco's blocks have captured about one-fifth of the U.S. market and have gained popularity in Canada, Italy, New Zealand and other countries. </TEXT></DOC>
