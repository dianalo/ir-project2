The astronomical observatory, nearly seven years late in liftingoff, will be placed in orbit 370 miles above Earth and enablescientists to see things so distant that their light has takenalmost since the beginning of the universe to reach Earth.   ``I think I can speak for everybody in that we can feel theexcitement building quite a bit now in these last few weeks. We'rejust glad to be finally this close to launch,'' said Air Force Col.Loren J. Shriver, the crew's commander.   ``We'll all feel a little bit of disbelief that we're finallygetting to do this. We'll probably all feel a certain amount ofpride,'' mission specialist Steven A. Hawley said at a newsconference.   Hawley is scheduled to use the shuttle's robot arm to deploy thetelescope on the second day of the five-day mission.   ``I can't even begin to imagine how good we're going to feelbecause it's been so long,'' said Marine Col. Charles F. BoldenJr., the mission's pilot.   The Hubble, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built,originally was scheduled for launch in late 1983 but technicalproblems postponed liftoff until 1985 and then 1986. The Challengerexplosion on Jan. 28, 1986, delayed the mission until 1989, andconcern over the shuttle's solid fuel booster rockets pushed itback yet again.   From its orbit, the 25,000-pound, 43-foot-long telescope will beable to detect light of all wavelengths, including ultraviolet,before it is absorbed or distorted by the atmosphere.   The telescope will look seven times more deeply into space anddetect objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater claritythan the best ground-based observatory. Its eight-foot primaryoptical mirror is the most precise ever made.   Astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distantthat their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.Scientists believe the universe is 15 billion years old.   The other crew members are mission specialists Kathryn D.Sullivan and Bruce McCandless II, a Navy captain, who both saidthey are ready to go on a spacewalk if necessary to repair orretrieve the observatory if necessary after deployment.   Shriver said he is not concerned about damaged axle nuts foundon the nose wheels of Atlantis and Columbia and suspected to be thesame on Discovery. NASA temporarily delayed Discovery's move to thelaunch pad last week until technicians concluded there was nothreat to the mission.   Because of their prestigious payload, the astronauts have foundthemselves the subject of considerable attention and even a littleenvy within NASA.   ``There's no such thing as a bad mission,'' Hawley said. ``But Ithink there are a lot of people who would like to trade places withus.''</TEXT></DOC>
