 They also shouldrespond clearly and accurately based on the parameters of a searchrequest, without demanding layers of verification.andP;  Existing textsearch and retrieval products do not meet these criteria.andP;  Insteadthey rely on indexing and insufficiently specific Boolean searchtechniques and return incorrect or extraneous information.andO;'Posting' files with information on the location of words to limitthe spread of extra information does not, by itself, providesufficient control.andP;  A better approach is to combine controlledvocabulary, a thesaurus and inverted file indexing with postingand grouping of words into conceptual topics.andP;  Another approach isto build and search data bases on a hypertext linking model.andO;While beneficial to users, these text management methods arecostly and laborious to create.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Text Data BasesDocument Management SystemsSoftware Design.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Techniques that reduce mismatched responses to text queries.andO;(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>1990s Increase Demand for Text-Query ImprovementsandM;In the 1990s, users will demand that text-management applications meetcertain requirements, including friendlier user interfaces and the ability togenerate answers that do not require additional verification.andP;  They willassume that the information returned will fit well within the parameters oftheir search request.andM;Today, however, most text applications do not live up to these expectations.andO;Many employ an indexing technology that uses inverted lists.andP;  This approachmaintains an alphabetic listing (referred to as a dictionary file) of all thewords that comprise a text collection, omitting &quot;noise&quot; words such as &quot;the,&quot;&quot;a&quot; and &quot;and.&quot;andM;To search this data pool, users must apply Boolean logic to phrase queries.andO;However, because the queries are not specific, a single search phrase mightretrieve unrelated or unnecessary articles.andM;To minimize obvious mismatches, most text-retrieval software offers atechnique known as proximity searching, which lets the user specify thenumber of words, sentences or paragraphs that can separate individual searchterms.andM;To support proximity searching, a postings file is created in addition to thedictionary file.andP;  This file maintains detailed information pertaining to eachword's location in the document.andM;Also, most full-text retrieval software supports wild-card and prefix/suffixqueries to help make the search process more effective.andP;  Other commonly usedtechniques include phonetic searching--where, for example, a search on&quot;Mayer&quot; would also locate files with &quot;Meyer&quot;--and the ability to browse theindex itself, letting the user gain familiarity with the words that comprisethe text collection.andM;To minimize user frustration with query results, many vendors offer thesauruscapabilities to improve recall and precision in the retrieval process.andM;A thesaurus can clarify terminology, provide corss-referencing and supplysynonyms.andP;  As key words are entered, they can be compared to a thesaurus andswitched to a preferred term for consistency.andM;Topic, a text-retrieval product from Verity Inc., is one product that bridgesthe methods of inverted-file indexing with controlled vocabulary.andP;  Usersgroup terms into symbolic concepts and relate these concepts to each othervia a graphical representation that can be browsed and assigned a label.andO;These representations, called &quot;topics,&quot; are used to search criteria and canbe combined using Boolean operations.andM;Hypertext is yet another text-management medium.andP;  This approach, which linksrelated pieces of text, offers a unique capability--readers can browsethrough the text collection by following links of interest.andP;  Their quest forinformation can be as specific or as general as they wish.andM;Hypertext applications require that someone with knowledge of the domainidentify the location of the links.andP;  In addition, the links must be manuallybuilt into the application.andP;  They are analogous to GOTO statements inunstructured programming code, with all the attendant maintenance problems.andM;The assigning of key words, the building of topics and any otherlabor-intensive front-end work requires a major commitment from anorganization.andP;  The alternative, inverted-file indexing, can be performedautomatically and may be beneficial when a large text collection is involved.andO;However, this approach requires that the user understand the conceptualcategories and relationships that exist in the collection.andM;Ideally, text-management facilities should understand natural language.andO;However, to date, interpreting the meaning of text requires humanintervention to supply intuitive and domain knowledge.andM;Next week I will discuss the role CD ROM plays in text management.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
