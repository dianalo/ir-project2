The department reported on Thursday that fatalities droppedsignificantly in 1987 and attributed the decline to increasing useof seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving.   The department said its characterization of the 1987 fatalityrate as the lowest in history used as a yardstick the number ofdeaths per 100 million miles of travel. For 1987 that figure was2.4 deaths. The highest number was the 24.08 deaths per 100 millionmiles in 1921, the first year the calculation was made.   The department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationalso released figures estimating that 8,035 lives were saved and95,500 injuries prevented by seat belts since 1983.   The rate of deaths per 100 million miles of travel dropped from2.5 in 1986 and 3.3 in 1980. About 40 percent of the fatalitieslast year involved drunken driving, a drop from the 46 percentthree years earlier.   The department said 32 states and the District of Columbia havemandatory seat belt laws and estimated 1,350 lives were saved in1987 alone because of the laws in effect.</TEXT></DOC>
