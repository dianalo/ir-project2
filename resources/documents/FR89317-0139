This is the second announcement of availability of funds to provide victimassistance in Indian country. The first notice of July 21, 1988, culminatedin the award of nine grants to states for a total of $1 million to supportthe development of victim assistance services through subgrants awardedby the states to tribes, Native American organizations, or other eligiblevictims assistance service agencies in Indian country, where, due to geographicalisolation or a scarcity of victim assistance programs, there are eitherno existing or insufficient victim assistance services.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The money for these grants will come from the Victims of Crime Act of 1984(VOCA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 10601 <T3>et seq. </T3>The Act established a Crime Victims Fund in the Departmentof Treasury made up of monies received from certain Federal criminal fines;special penalty assessments; forfeited appearance, bail bonds, and collateralsecurity; and literary profits due certain convicted Federal defendants.Under 42 U.S.C. 10603(c)(1)(B) a portion of these funds may be used toassist victims of Federal crimes.This money, set aside to improve the treatment of victims of Federal crime,can be used for a wide variety of activities that include, but are notlimited to: (a) Crisis intervention services such as counseling to provideemotional support to victims following a violent crime; (b) emergency short-termchild care services or temporary shelter for family violence victims; (c)assistance in participation in Federal criminal justice proceedings; (d)payment of reasonable costs for a forensic medical examination to a Federalcrime victim; (e) training of law enforcement personnel in the deliveryof services to Federal crime victims and publications of related materials;and (f) the payment of salaries of personnel who provide assistance servicesto victims of Federal crime. During Fiscal Year 1988 OVC has assisted victims of Federal crime by supportingtraining of Victim-Witness Coordinators in the U.S. Attorneys' offices,by co-sponsoring a conference attended by teams of Assistant U.S. Attorneys,Victim-Witness Coordinators, and Federal investigators on the investigationand prosecution of child sexual abuse and through an interagency agreementwith the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center to develop a curriculumand to train Federal law enforcement agencies regarding victim witnessresponsibilities, issues and services prescribed by the Victim and WitnessProtection Act of 1982. In addition, funds have been made available, throughthe U.S. Attorneys' offices, for direct assistance, e.g., mental healthservices, to victims of Federal crimes when no other source of supportwas available.Recognizing the need to provide information and training regarding victimassistance services in Indian country, OVC co-sponsored a conference, ``IndianNations: Justice for Victims of Crime'', in November of 1988 in Rapid City,South Dakota. The conference focused on the special needs of crime victimson American Indian reservations and how these needs could be met throughthe development of victim assistance services. Approximately 450 personsrepresenting tribes, law enforcement and state victim assistance agencieswere in attendance. Native Americans as well as other Federal, state andlocal professionals who work with the legal, law enforcement or victimassistance aspects of providing services to victims of crime in Indiancountry helped plan the conference. Many of the speakers were Native Americanswho were involved in managing successful programs in their own communities.Consistent with Congressional intent, 132 <T3>Cong. Rec. </T3>H11294 (daily ed. October 17, 1986), nearly all ofthe funds OVC has allocated to date for providing direct assistance tovictims of Federal crime have been used to aid Native American Indians.This experience has convinced OVC of the need to commit significant fundsto develop and expand new or existing victim assistance services that willprovide direct services to victims of Federal crime in Indian country.Consequently, in July of 1988, OVC announced the availability of $1 millionfor the purpose of providing direct services to victims of Federal crimein Indian country by expanding existing services to make victim assistanceservices accessible in geographically remote areas or to develop new programswhere none existed to meet the clear and pressing needs of these crimevictims. The response was tremendous; eighteen state victim assistanceagencies applied for funds on behalf of tribes in their states. Requestsfor funds far exceeded the $1 million and both the descriptions of populationsto be served and the need for services detailed in the grant applicationsmade it clear that a greater effort was needed. OVC resolved to use themajor portion of funds available under section 1404(c)(1)(B) [42 U.S.C.10603(c)(1)(B)] of the Victims of Crime Act to continue the effort to establishvictim assistance services in Indian country.In this second announcement OVC will make available between six and eightgrants to selected state agencies presently administering VOCA victim assistancegrants. These agencies will in turn either subgrant or contract with Indiantribes or Native American and other eligible organizations for victim assistanceservices in Indian country where currently no program exist or where servicesneed to be augmented. This notice describes the availability and purposesof this grant program. Individual states that have a qualifying targetpopulation eligible to receive these services should contact OVC and requesta grant information and application package. Eligible states which didnot receive grant awards under the July 21, 1988, announcement are urgedto apply; states which did receive awards under the previous announcementwill not be eligible for funds under the current announcement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Questions concerning this noticeshould be directed to Susan Shriner, Program Specialist, OVC, or Toni Thomas,Program Specialist, OVC, 633 Indiana Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, 20531,(202) 272-6500.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose</ITAG>The Office for Victims of Crime is making $700,000 available to selectedstates to promote the development of direct services to victims of Federalcrimes in Indian country.
