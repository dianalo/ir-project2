Boesky, settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he helped Mr. Boesky's firm violate capital requirements.    Mr. Davidoff also agreed to cooperate in the SEC's continuing investigation of the insider-trading scandal.    Last January, Mr. Davidoff pleaded guilty to one felony count of willfully violating capital requirements last year while head trader at Seemala Corp., a broker-dealer controlled by Mr. Boesky.    Mr. Davidoff, 43 years old, consented to a permanent injunction against violating securities laws and was barred from the securities industry.    Mr. Boesky, who had been a prominent takeover speculator, agreed last November to plead guilty to a single felony charge arising from alleged insider trading.    Mr. Davidoff didn't admit or deny the SEC charges, which paralleled the earlier criminal charge. The SEC complaint said that Mr. Davidoff, at Mr. Boesky's direction, engaged in bogus sales of securities to &quot;various other broker-dealers&quot; to falsely create the appearance that Seemala had adequate net capital. The complaint didn't identify the other firms.    Mr. Davidoff's lawyer, David Katsky, said that the SEC &quot;didn't charge Mr. Davidoff with any insider trading or claim that he personally profited from any wrongdoing.&quot; He said that the SEC complaint involved &quot;technical violations&quot; of capital rules. </TEXT></DOC>
