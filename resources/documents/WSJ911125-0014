Oil inventories may be relatively high even as theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produces flatout at nearly 24 million barrels a day. But winter is comingon, with its peak demand for oil, and the world's petroleumsupplies and demand appear to be in a delicate balance.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, oil prices, often a contentious issue forOPEC, are relatively firm as the ministers begin arriving fortheir winter conference, which begins tomorrow.   &quot;I feel that this time we will have a short week,&quot; said anearly arrival, Celestino Armas, oil minister of Venezuela andpresident of OPEC. &quot;The conditions we face are about the sameas when we met in September,&quot; he added. Then, OPEC agreed tocontinue a token production ceiling near actual output levelsuntil year end.   But Mr. Armas made clear that, so far as OPEC's productionis concerned, this conference will look ahead only to thefirst quarter of 1992 and that country quotas are not in thepicture, leaving the exporters free to produce whatever theycan for that period. He also ruled out the likelihood thatthis ministerial meeting will establish any production limitsfor next year's second quarter. Citing oil-marketuncertainties, Mr. Armas suggested that &quot;maybe it is notconvenient to forecast beyond the first quarter.&quot;   Such an approach appears to be in line with thepreferences of Saudi Arabia, which is OPEC's leadingproducer, but it doesn't coincide with the goals of someother oil ministers whose countries cannot produce more andthus need higher prices to maintain their revenue. Some areconcerned that, despite the stability of oil markets sincethe Persian Gulf crisis, the others in OPEC eventually willhave to make room for a resumption of oil exports by Iraq andKuwait. Meanwhile, they note, the average price of the OPECbasket of seven crudes is more than $1 a barrel below thereference price of $21.   Kuwait has resumed production, although its exports won'tbe significant until 1992, when it expects to reach 800,000barrels a day by mid-year. The status of exports from Iraq isnot so clear. It has not officially accepted or rejected theoffer by the United Nations Security Council to lift theembargo against it temporarily for the sale of $1.6 billionin oil for humanitarian reasons. At today's prices, thatwould suggest Iraqi exports could average between 500,000 and600,000 barrels a day if it were to spread the oil sales oversix months.   But if it does accept the offer it might elect to exportall the oil over a three-month period, which means onemillion barrels a day could begin pouring into oil marketsfrom Iraq in next year's first or second quarter.   The Iraqi oil minister, Osama A. R. AlHiti, was the firstto arrive for this OPEC meeting but gave no clues as to whatIraq will do. &quot;I may have something for you&quot; today, he toldreporters last night.   Meanwhile, the oil ministers of Algeria, Nigeria andIndonesia are among those who have expressed deep concernabout what might happen to oil markets and oil prices if OPECcontinues to produce near capacity as demand begins toslacken seasonally next year.   Neither Nordine Ait-Lauossine of Algeria nor GinandjarKartasasmita of Indonesia will arrive until today. But JibrilAminu, the Nigerian oil minister, arrived last night, and hetold reporters that there must be some discussion at thismeeting about production limits for the second quarter&quot;because of seasonal demand and the increasing likelihoodthat Kuwait, or Iraq, or both, will come back into themarket.&quot;   Mr. Ginandjar, the Indonesian oil minister, was in theU.S. over the weekend after having gone to Dallas for aFriday address to the Institute for the Study of Earth andMan. He told the group that OPEC &quot;will have to weigh verycarefully the situation of the second quarter of 1992, as aseasonal decline in demand should be expected.&quot; Then, at anews conference, he said that when the oil ministers nextmeet after this, probably in March, they will have to decideon new production restraints. &quot;The big fight will be inMarch,&quot; he said.   In an interview, however, Mr. Ginandjar said that nowwould be the opportune time to discuss second-quarterproduction quotas because of the current lack of pressures onOPEC. The factors that will affect OPEC and its oil marketsin the second quarter already are known, he suggested. &quot;Wehave to take into consideration the drop in demand, theincrease in Kuwait's production and the possibility Iraq willbe coming into the market,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
