Two underlying questionscan be used to structure the discussion: (1) Is there significant uncertaintyin the estimate of risks associated with radiation exposure? (2) Willphysicians have difficulty in explaining these risks to patients andtheir families? The answer to both questions is affirmative. With regardto the first, there are considerable uncertainties at both high and lowlevels of exposure. The risks will probably be difficult to explain forseveral reasons, including the fact that the perception of risk is contextualand the probabilistic nature of these risks is not easy to convey. Threeapproaches to the explication of long-term risks are outlined: (1) theadditional carcinogenic and genetic risks associated with radiation exposure;(2) the relative risks of other fatal occurrences; and (3) the comparisonof risks with those from intended exposures and medical radiation procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
