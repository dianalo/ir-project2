The bill would authorize $200,000 in public financing forHouse candidates who limit their overall campaign spendingfor primary and general elections to $600,000 -- the averageamount spent by winning House Democrats in tight races lastyear. Candidates would receive even more public funding iftheir opponents don't abide by the spending limits.</LP><TEXT>   Under the plan, which President Bush has alreadythreatened to veto, candidates could accept no more than$200,000 in contributions from corporate, labor and otherpolitical action committees. In a move to stem the influenceof wealthy contributors, House candidates could accept nomore than $200 from individuals and no more than $200,000 intotal individual contributions.   Speaker Tom Foley (D., Wash.) said the legislation wouldbring a &quot;level playing field to the members of Congress andchallengers.&quot; The bill drew praise from groups such as CommonCause and Public Citizen, which have been pressing forcampaign finance reform for more than a decade.   But House Republicans have opposed spending limits and arestaunchly against using taxpayer funds to pay forcongressional elections. They plan to introduce their owncampaign finance overhaul bill, requiring candidates to raisemore of their campaign funds inside their districts.</TEXT></DOC>
