Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, a South African spokesman forthe territorial police, said groups of more than 50 blacknationalist insurgents were seen heading south, disobeying ordersfrom their exiled leader to withdraw north to Angola.   Angola, Cuba and South Africa negotiated the withdrawal at theweekend to get the independence plan back on track after heavyfighting last week.   Guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization are toreport to U.N.-supervised assembly points or border posts and leaveNamibia by Saturday.   Du Rand said police trackers found evidence that only a handfulof guerrillas have crossed back into Angola of an estimated 1,900which South Africa says entered Namibia starting April 1. Pretoriahas won international backing for its assertion the incursionviolates a regional peace accord calling for SWAPO fighters to stayat bases in Angola until May 15.   The Namibian Council of Churches said it received no reports ofguerrillas appearing at churches and missions, which have beensuggested safe gathering places.   Territorial officials said the United Nations agreed thatterritorial police supervised by U.N. peacekeepers couldinterrogate guerrillas who report whereabouts of other insurgentsand possible arms caches. Du Rand said police are concerned someguerrillas may hide their weapons, don civilian clothes and try tostay in Namibia.   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma said Monday in a radio interview withthe British Broadcasting Corp. that there is confusion about how tospread word of the withdrawal. He said guerrillas would not trustappeals from territorial authorities and most do not have radios tohear broadcasts of the withdrawal agreement.   A contingent of 210 Finnish soldiers flew Tuesday into Windhoekto join U.N. forces monitoring the transition to independence,including elections scheduled for November. About 1,400 of the4,650-member force has arrived.   Youths in Windhoek's black township, Katutura, boycotted classesTuesday to show support for guerrillas killed last week. Five of 14schools were empty, the Education Department said.   About 500 youths marched from school to school, hailing theslain guerrillas as heroes and denouncing the paramilitary policeunit responsible for many of the deaths. SWAPO has been fightingSouth African rule since 1966.   Du Rand reported only ``a few skirmishes'' with guerrillasMonday and Tuesday.   He put the death toll at 263 guerrillas and 27 security forcemembers. SWAPO says its losses are much lower and charges at leasta fifth of those killed were civilians.   The fighting broke out April 1, the first day of a yearlongprocess to make Namibia independent of South Africa, which hasruled the mineral-rich territory since World War I and in defianceof U.N. demands it withdraw.   In northern Namibia, more than 130 Australian, British,Malaysian and Nigerian soldiers drove out of military bases Tuesdayin convoys of white trucks and landrovers to set up assembly pointsin two remote villages and near seven border posts. They hung theinternational organization's blue and white flag from trees,aerials and poles.   South Africa agreed to give Namibia independence in exchange forCuba withdrawing its 50,000 troops from Angola, where theysupported the Marxist government's forces in a civil war againstrebels backed by South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
