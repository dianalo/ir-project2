Security Pacific, based in Los Angeles, said it paid theResolution Trust Corp. a premium of $35 million, or 2.5%, forthe Phoenix-based thrift's $1.4 billion of deposits.</LP><TEXT>   The premium is lower than some other big banks have paidfor ailing Arizona thrifts. Nearly all of the state's Sandamp;Lshave failed in recent years, victims of poor lendingpractices, overbuilding and skidding real estate prices.   Despite the state's persistant economic troubles, many bigbanks, including BankAmerica Corp., have been eager to expandin Arizona because they expect long-term population growththere and an eventual rebound.   Security Pacific has lost tens of millions of dollars overthe past several quarters as a result of its Arizonaoperations, contributing its recent poor financialperformance. It said the acquistion makes it Arizona'sthird-largest financial institution.</TEXT></DOC>
