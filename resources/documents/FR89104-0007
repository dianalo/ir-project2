After issuing AD 60-17-03, as amended, the FAA hasdetermined that the AD requires a revision to include provisions for theissuance of special flight permits and alternate means of compliance, whichcorrespond to the new paragraphs (g) and (f) respectively. In addition,a note is added to existing paragraph (e) which will allow a pilot to conductchecks of the blade pressure system.Since the amendment provides a clarification and alternate means of compliance,and imposes no additional burden on any person, notice and public procedurehereon are unnecessary, and the amendment may be made effective in lessthan 30 days from publication.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule will not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federal Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is only clarifying in nature;provides for the optional use of alternative methods of compliance; and,imposes no additional regulatory or economic burden on anyone. Therefore,I certify that this action (1) is not a ``major rule'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policiesand Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) will not havea significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
