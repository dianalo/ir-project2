Taking the caseof a 10 M and a 10/sup 6/ M central Schwarzschild hole, detailed evolutionof a representative element of matter as it accretes into the hole ispresented in the case when the initial abundance (at the outer edge ofthe disk) is same as the solar abundance. It is suggested that such studiesmay eventually shed light on the composition of the outgoing jets observedin the active galaxies and SS433.</TEXT></DOC>
