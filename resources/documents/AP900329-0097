The violence, most of it among black factions, flared just asthe government launched reforms aimed at ending white-minorityrule. It is frightening whites already nervous about governmentmoves toward ending apartheid.   While the reforms announced in February have given radical blackgroups more freedom to stage protests, the violence results frommany causes and frictions.   It reflects the deep divisions in South Africa over apartheidand poses a major threat to hopes for a peaceful future.   Hundreds of people have been killed in clashes in recent weeks,mostly between rival black political and ethnic factions. Theviolence is the worst since major anti-government protests in themid-1980s.   It ranges from factional tribal battles in Natal Province andmilitary coups in the black homelands, to clashes between rivalblack political groups and unrest in the black townships.   The causes range from ancient tribal rivalry to conflictingviews on the country's future.   There also have been violent confrontations between whites andblacks.   In some areas, right-wing whites have formed armed and uniformedgroups that have attacked and beaten blacks involved in politicalactivities. In one rural town, right-wingers have started to takethe place of the local police.   Political analysts say the white-black clashes, relatively minorto this point, represent the most serious threat to peace. Theyfear a backlash by the powerful 5-million-strong white minorityagainst anti-apartheid efforts and black violence.   ``The war in Natal, with its ghastly death toll, the killings intownships and the burning of properties and people, are raisingfears of a situation that could get out of hand,'' The Citizennewspaper said in a March 29 editorial.   A ``white backlash ... is grave cause for concern ... in theend, we may descend into the kind of Beirut situation that woulddestroy this country,'' the newspaper said.   Unease among whites is matched by growing militancy among manyyoung blacks in the townships. Radical blacks are reluctant to waitfor negotiated or gradual reform and are flocking to militantgroups that talk of seizing power.   ``The high incidence of unrest points to a revolutionaryclimate, and that is dangerous at a time when restraint isnecessary in order to negotiate,'' one analyst said on condition ofnot being identified.   Nelson Mandela and other black leaders have had little successin curbing the violence.   Mandela's African National Congress, the main black oppositiongroup, favors negotiated settlement. But it is under pressure fromthe Pan African Congress and more radical groups who oppose anegotiated deal.   President F.W. de Klerk faces similar problems in retainingwhite support. He stunned the nation in February by legalizingblack opposition groups, then freed Mandela after the black leaderhad spent 27 years in prison.   Talks between the government and black leaders are scheduledApril 11 to try to clear the way for full-scale negotiations onchanging the constitution to give blacks a voice in nationalaffairs.   Many whites are stunned by the lightning pace of change in SouthAfrica after some 350 years of white domination. They also feardemands by black groups for a redistribution of wealth from whitesto blacks.   The president must persuade a majority of whites to accept theend of apartheid if a new political system is to be established.Failure to keep white support would imperil the government'schances of reforms.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS: Barry Renfrew is the AP bureau chief in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
