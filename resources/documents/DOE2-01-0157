<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-0157 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the Federal Republic of Germany natural gas has been advancing fromvirtually nothing to an energy source which today is the second in importanceon the heat market. Since the development started in the middle of thesixties, there are meanwhile about 300 000 households each year wishingto install a gas-fired heating system. In 1985 the number of householdsequipped with gas-fired heating systems amounted to about 7 million.However, due to the competition among the different energy sources grownfiercer in recent years the natural gas companies must not fail to pursuetheir marketing activities. Natural gas will keep on competing with petroleum.The reduction of prices is in full swing. The development of naturalgas prices is parallel to that of the competing energy sources. Whatis making natural gas a permanently attractive energy source is the emissionof stockpiling, its low-pollution properties, combustion properties (homogeneousfuel/air mixtures) and the economic operation of furnaces and heatingsystems. Another advantage worth to be mentioned is the fact that naturalgas availability does not depend on imports from political problem regionsand that the natural gas utilities are both offering supply servicesand consulting services during the planning, installation and operationof natural gas systems.
