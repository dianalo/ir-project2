This strategy worked once before, in 1977, when then-Prime Minister John Vorster used the Carter administration's hostility toward South Africa to increase his party's majority in a snap election among white voters. Now, President P.W. Botha is hoping it will work again.    On New Year's Eve, Mr. Botha announced an election for the white chamber of parliament later this year, and called on his countrymen to unite and rally around his government in the face of strong international pressure, particularly from the U.S.    Mr. Botha said he will give the date for the election later this month; under South Africa's constitution, an election requires 56 days' notice. Political analysts said the vote will be held as soon as possible to capitalize on the wave of anti-South African sentiment around the world and the corresponding wave of nationalism among many South African whites.    &quot;The more the Americans hate Botha, the better it is for him in an election. He's almost pleading for it,&quot; said a source close to strategists for the National Party, which has been in power since 1948.    A Foreign Ministry official added: &quot;South African elections are usually America-bashing exercises. This one will be no exception.&quot;    In his end-of-the-year address to South Africans, Mr. Botha lashed out at &quot;the vindictive actions by some governments and legislators, such as those in the United States.&quot; He said international economic sanctions have been &quot;totally counterproductive&quot; and have &quot;served only to frustrate our attempts to reach our goals.&quot; He denounced outside pressure to change the system of racial segregation, or apartheid, within South Africa as &quot;opportunistic and selfish.&quot;    Although the president said his government is trying to normalize its foreign relations, he added, &quot;We dare not yield to the irresponsible and often superficial demands which will destroy everything created over so many decades by so many generations.&quot;    &quot;The best results,&quot; he said, &quot;can only be achieved if the spirit of revolution and violence fanned from outside our country can effectively be kept at bay.&quot;    Mr. Botha is hoping that the election will give him a stronger mandate to continue with his cautious racial reforms. These tentative steps toward change have caused deep divisions within the white electorate, particularly among the Afrikaner community, which has traditionally staunchly supported the National Party.    The more conservative parties have been gaining support from National Party defectors worried that racial reform will dismantle apartheid and jeopardize the Afrikaner identity. By calling an election now and asking for unity in response to a common outside foe, Mr. Botha is aiming to preempt this move to the far right and take advantage of the lack of coordination among the conservative parties.    But political analysts said that until the election, any further changes will be kept on ice -- the government is delaying for several months debate on the scrapping of the Group Areas Act, which dictates where people of the various races may live and work -- and that Mr. Botha will continue to take a hard line in implementing the state of emergency, which has been in effect since June 12.    Although few people doubt the National Party's ability to retain its parliamentary majority, there is a question of whether the major opposition in the future will be a coalition of conservative parties or the Progressive Federal Party. Currently, the Nationalists hold 127 seats in the white parliament, the Progressives 27 and the conservative parties 19.    In announcing an election for the white electorate, Mr. Botha didn't mention the other two chambers of parliament. The new constitution, adopted in 1984, created a three-chamber parliament, with separate assemblies for whites, Indians and coloreds, or people of mixed race, but none for blacks. Under the constitution, Mr. Botha can call for an election for white legislators, while leaving the other two chambers intact. </TEXT></DOC>
