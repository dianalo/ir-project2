(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Titan rocket packing a secretPentagon payload streaked off on an apparently routine flight intoorbit, but the fiery blastoff ignited brush fires that closed thelaunch area for more than an hour.   The $65 million Titan 34D lifted off at 3:47 p.m. Wednesday andappeared to be flying normally through a partly cloudy sky.   As with other military space flights, the Air Force did notannounce the launch in advance. But with more than 20,000 employeesworking at Cape Canaveral and adjacent Kennedy Space Center, itcouldn't hide the fact that the 16-story-tall rocket was going tobe launched.   Minutes before liftoff, hundreds of workers poured out ofbuildings to watch.   The Air Force issued a brief post-launch statement saying onlythat a Titan 34D had been launched successfully. It provided noinformation on the nature of the payload.   There was no damage to launch pad from brush fires triggered bythe rocket's exhaust, officials said.   Lt. Gen. Aloysius Casey, retiring commander of the Air ForceSpace Division, told a conference last year that the first Titan34D launched in 1989 would carry up two communications satellitesnamed DSCS _ for Defense Satellite Communications System.   The satellites are built to provide secure voice and high datarate transmission for American military and diplomaticcommunications.   Sources close to the project who spoke on condition of anonynitysaid Wednesday the satellites were aboard the Titan 34D.   A Chalet satellite designed to monitor Soviet communicationsnetworks was aboard a Titan 34D launched last Sept. 2. An upperstage failure left that payload in the wrong orbit.   On Nov. 6, a Titan 34D successfully launched a payload believedto be a pair of satellites intended to monitor Soviet missile testsand electronic communciations.   One Titan 34D remains in the Air Force inventory. It isscheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral later this year and willbe replaced by the more powerful Titan 4.   The first Titan 4 is scheduled for launch here within a fewweeks, carrying a satellite designed to provide instant warning ofa hostile missile attack on the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
