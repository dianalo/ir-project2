The agreement is likely to prove controversial in Egypt. It requires the country to devalue its currency to bring the official exchange rate into line with the free market, a move that will cause domestic prices to rise. The accord also requires the government to reduce its budget deficit and to take other steps to decrease its role in the economy.    Egypt maintains an expensive subsidy system that keeps prices down for such basic items as bread, sugar and gasoline. Egyptian officials have been wary of raising prices for Egypt's vast poor population ever since riots broke out in 1977, when prices on 25 basic commodities were raised in a single day.    The country already has begun efforts to devalue its currency. Last week, representatives of eight banks began setting the exchange rate for certain transactions on a daily basis, without government interference. The rate applies to remittances from Egyptians working abroad, tourism facilities, bank purchases of foreign currency and both private-sector and public-sector exports.    Economy Minister Yousri Mustafa last week called the new system &quot;the start of the creation of a free foreign-currency trade market.&quot; But he added that it could take &quot;a year or more&quot; to incorporate the remaining sectors of the economy into the new exchange rate.    The IMF agreement is expected to pave the way for a restructuring of as much as $5 billion of Egypt's foreign debt by the Paris Club, an informal committee consisting of representatives of creditor governments. Unlike debtor nations such as Mexico and Brazil, whose debt is largely owed to private banks, Egypt owes most of its debt to foreign governments.    Debt relief is crucial to Egypt because of a severe cash shortage that makes it difficult for the country to both pay its foreign creditors and foot its mammoth bill for food imports. The country needs to import half the food needed to feed its burgeoning population of 50 million.    The cash shortage was brought on by last year's plunge in oil revenue; the nation had relied on oil sales for two-thirds of its export earnings. Egypt also has been hurt by a decline in oil-related incomefrom ships passing through the Suez Canal and Egyptians working in oil-rich countries abroad -- and in tourism. Tourists have been scared off by terrorism in the Mideast.    The IMF agreement and expected Paris Club rescheduling are only short-term fixes for Egypt's economy, but the structural changes being called for are designed to help solve the country's long-term problems of feeding its population and curbing the government's pervasive role in the economy. Egypt and the IMF are expected to try to strike a new agreement after this 18-month accord expires. </TEXT></DOC>
