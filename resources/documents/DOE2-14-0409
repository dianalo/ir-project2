Both factors are, in turn, related to the depth and sizeof the region of interest. The authors' solution is a ladder design withelectronically switchable cross connections. The enables them to selectsize and position of the sensitive volume and change it from the consoleduring the examination. The user can subsequently focus on an area ofinterest with optimized S/N. As a Helmholtz design with two ladders inparallel, the same coil provides high-quality images of the neck, pelvis,hips, extremities, and (by removing the upper portion) the spine.</TEXT></DOC>
