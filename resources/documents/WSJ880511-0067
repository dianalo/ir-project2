Bankers predict the prime, or base, rate, now 8 1/2%, will rise to at least 8 3/4% and possibly to 9%. That would be the first increase since last October, just before the stock market crash.    &quot;I think an increase is on the way,&quot; said Norman Robertson, a senior vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. &quot;It could happen any day now.&quot; He cited &quot;fairly steady increases&quot; in most rates recently as well as &quot;brisk&quot; business loan demand. Bankers also say the case for a higher prime rate was bolstered by signs this week that the Federal Reserve has tightened its credit vise slightly, a move confirmed late yesterday by White House economist Beryl Sprinkel.    Several Federal Reserve officials have concluded that they must push short-term rates higher to keep inflation under control. A small move now might help avert the need for stronger medicine later this year, they say.    Prime rate changes often lag far behind other interest rate moves. Nevertheless, the prime still is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate on loans to many small and medium-size businesses. It also is used as a benchmark for many types of consumer loans, including home-equity loans.    However, the nation's largest companies pay little attention to the prime rate because they can turn to other, cheaper sources of credit, such as the commercial paper market. Also, banks offer loans to these companies at well below the prime rate in an effort to discourage them from turning to alternative markets.    Some short-term rates already have climbed about half a percentage point since early April. For example, the federal funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans between banks, has climbed to more than 7% from about 6 5/8% less than two months ago.    Riggs National Bank in Washington increased its prime rate to 8 3/4% from 8 1/2% late last month. Other banks left their rate unchanged. Some bankers said they were waiting to see what the Fed's next move would be.    James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research Corp., contends that banks haven't matched the Riggs National Bank move yet because they were &quot;waiting to see how the dust settles&quot; and &quot;to see the direction of short-term rates.&quot; Now, he says, &quot;We've pretty much gotten the signal.&quot;    An industrywide prime rate increase could come as soon as the end of this week and probably would be in the neighborhood of one-quarter of a percentage point, Mr. Solloway says. &quot;I think 50 basis points (half a percentage point) is a possibility, but I just don't see banks wanting to incur the wrath of politicians right now.&quot;    Maury Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc., agrees that a prime rate increase of one-quarter of a percentage point is &quot;coming any time, any day now because the Fed's tightening up&quot; monetary policy. He says none of the major money center banks jumped to follow the Riggs National Bank increase because there was &quot;a lot of uncertainty&quot; about interest rates. &quot;No one wanted to jump the gun before there was a smoking gun. But they've got the smoking gun now.&quot;    Kathleen Stephansen, vice president and senior economist at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., also expects a prime rate increase sometime in the next few days. She said the Fed &quot;seems to be targeting a higher federal funds rate&quot; of at least 7% to 7 1/8%.    Yesterday, the funds rate rose slightly further, hovering just over 7 1/4% for much of the day. It averaged about 7 1/8% Monday, up from 6 7/8% last Thursday and Friday. Many analysts agree with Ms. Stephansen that the Fed will try to keep the funds rate between 7% and 7 1/8%. </TEXT></DOC>
