Brown, the establishment lawyer whoplayed a key backstage role in Jesse Jackson's anti-establishmentpresidential campaign, is poised to take the spotlight himself asthe first black to head a major political party in the United States.   Brown's ascension to the Democratic Party chairmanship became allbut certain Wednesday when he was endorsed by his chief rival forthe post.   It was a remarkably swift triumph for the 47-year-old politicalveteran who grew up in Harlem but attended predominantly whiteschools on New York's Upper East Side.   His parents were graduates of Howard University, one of thenation's premier black colleges, but they sent their only child toMiddlebury College in Vermont, where he was one of the few blacks.He now serves on the college's board of trustees and is chairman ofthe board of the Kennedy Institute for Politics at Harvard.   Brown worked for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and studied law underMario Cuomo. His ties to the Democratic Party's liberal wing arefirm, and were cited by opponents to his bid for the partychairmanship.   Former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma, who said he was remaining inthe race at least long enough to assess if he had a chance to win,said the question for Democrats is ``whether we're going to beperceived as mainstream or to the left of the mainstream.''   The breakthrough for Brown came when Richard Wiener, chairman ofthe Michigan Democratic Party, abruptly announced, ``I am ending mycampaign for Democratic National chair.''   ``From the outset of my campaign, I have stated that the nextchair of our party would be either myself or Ron Brown _ andproperly so. By taking this action today, I believe that this racehas effectively ended and that Ron Brown will achieve a first-ballotvictory.''   The Democratic National Committee will elect the new chairman onFeb. 10.   In a statement thanking Wiener for his support, Brown said, ``Inow have more than enough votes to win the chair of the DNC. I amvery, very pleased and look forward to leading a united party forthe next four years.''   He said his first priority would be ``to reach out to allDemocrats. Our strength as a party depends upon our ability toappeal to Americans in every region with a message of strength andhope.''   The only other candidate remaining in the race was former Rep.James Stanton of Ohio, who had no immediate comment on the latestdevelopment.   Assuming that Brown succeeds Paul G. Kirk Jr. as chairman, he mayface tough sledding achieving his goal of uniting the party,particularly in the South.   ``Ron is probably the most qualified guy in the race,'' saidFlorida Democratic Party chairman Charles Whitehead. ``But theperception in this state is that Ron is Jesse's and Ted's andlabor's guy. ... It poses a political problem a little bit inFlorida.''   But Whitehead said he would do ``anything I can to help Ronovercome that perception.''   Less amenable to a Brown victory was Alabama chairman John Baker,who has said it would represent a triumph for the ``ultra-liberal''wing of the party. Baker said he would ignore a national partyheaded by Brown.   Southern opponents of Brown argued that election of a liberal aschairman would drive from the Democratic Party those whites who haveremained loyal _ a dwindling bloc in recent elections.   Brown has portrayed the opposition to his candidacy as raciallymotivated.   ``People will look you in the face and say you have thecredentials for the job, but ...,'' he said. ``It is race-consciousbehavior.''   He said the only way to overcome that attitude is ``to put lighton it and make people address it.''   For a decade Brown moved smoothly through the capital's corridorsof power, winning ready acceptance when he ran the Urban League'sWashington office and then as Kennedy's general counsel and staffdirector on the Senate Judiciary Committee.   He was deputy manager of Kennedy's unsuccessful challenge ofPresident Jimmy Carter for the 1980 Democratic presidentialnomination.   When that campaign ended, Brown accepted an offer to become apartner in one of the capital's major law firms. With clients thatincluded the Japanese electronics industry and the government ofHaiti, Brown earned a six-figure salary and drove a Jaguar.   He and his wife, Alma, have a son, Michael, who is in law school,and a daughter, Tracy, who is a senior at Boston College.   While pursuing his lucrative law practice, Brown remained activein Democratic Party affairs.   Jackson was rebuffed when he tried to recruit Brown to manage hispresidential campaign. But in May 1988, when only Jackson andMichael Dukakis remained in the race, Brown agreed to serve asJackson's convention manager.   While Democrats were certain Dukakis would be their nominee theywere troubled by the question, ``What does Jesse want?'' Jackson wassending mixed signals about the vice presidential nomination and hisdemands for platform planks.   But Brown managed to deflect a potentially divisive platformdebate over Middle East policy and was instrumental in arranging theconvention's closing-night show of unity, when Jackson and hisfamily joined Dukakis at the podium.</TEXT></DOC>
