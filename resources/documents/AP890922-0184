The center of the storm advanced farther westward than expected,targeting eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New Yorkbefore it was expected to wear itself out in Canada. It was movingto the north at 30 mph.   Charleston, S.C., got the full brunt of Hugo, which wrecked astring of Caribbean resort islands beginning early Sunday. Therewere 20 confirmed deaths in the Caribbean, but an official on PuertoRico said the death toll for the region was 26 people. About 50,000people are homeless.   Ten of the 11 U.S. deaths were in South Carolina. Eight died incounties surrounding Charleston and one in the Columbia area, saidWarren Hardy of the state's Office of Emergency Preparedness. InNorth Carolina, a 6-month-old baby was killed in Union County when atree fell on a house.   A hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm, moist air over openoceans. When these giant storms hit land, they lose their wallop,although they can still manage considerable bluster.   Hugo was downgraded into a tropical storm at 6 a.m. and decayedmore as it went inland, but places in its path could expect severalinches of rain and high winds. By 6 p.m., Hugo had lost thecharacteristics of a tropical storm, although the weather systemfeatured maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains.   Its last location was just west of Pittsburgh, Pa., at latitude40.5 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said nofurther tracking would be done.   Earlier, Hugo was expected to skirt West Virginia. Butcommunities in the southern part of the state instead were lashed byfierce winds and inundated with water.   ``It's blowing 45 or 50 miles an hour,'' said Fred Kitts, of theMercer County Sheriff's Department in Princeton. ``We've had treesfall on houses, cars, trailers. There are power lines everywhere.''   Heavy rains brought rapidly rising water, which forced someevacuations Friday in the Oakvale area of Mercer County, saidofficials with the county's emergency services. There were noimmediate reports of injuries.   At 4 p.m. EDT, the weather service said the center of the rapidlyweakening storm had moved out of West Virginia into southeasternOhio. Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, saidthe storm was expected to pass through eastern Ohio and westernPennsylvania late Friday or early Saturday.   The weather service issued a small stream and urban flood warningFriday evening for Cuyahoga and Medina counties in northeast Ohio.About 2{ inches of rain fell in Medina during a 90-minute periodlate Friday afternoon.   An outer band of the tropical storm hit Virginia's western halfearlier Friday, knocking down power lines and trees with windsgusting as high as 81 mph and forcing residents in low-lying areasof several counties to evacuate.   But the eye of the storm swept through the narrowest part of thestate _ entering in Washington County and exiting in Tazwell County_ and dumped far less rain than anticipated. Five to 10 inches ofrain was expected in areas where 3 inches or less fell.   ``It passed a lot farther west than we thought it would and itdidn't stay here too long,'' said Janet Clements, spokeswoman forthe state Department of Emergency Services. No serious injuries werereported.   In Washington, government agencies, schools, transit officialsand property owners, preparing for the worst, were relieved when thebrunt of the storm missed the nation's capital.   In New York City, rain and blustery winds were the biggestconcern. The threat of high tides and flooding and closed down theStatue of Liberty's island.   Emergency management coordinators in New Jersey also expected thethe worst from Hugo, but instead saw only some rainstorms and gustywinds.</TEXT></DOC>
