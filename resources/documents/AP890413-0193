That is the same number of days of work required to meet taxobligations in the last two years _ and the same as in 1981, whenacross-the-board cuts in federal taxes were enacted. Tax FreedomDay has never been later.   From another perspective, the ``average'' worker will have totoil two hours and 43 minutes each eight-hour day to satisfy thetax collectors, one minute more than last year.   ``Americans ... are no better off than they were in 1981,despite economic growth, cuts in income tax rates and repeatedclaims that government spending has been cut to the bone,'' thefoundation said.   Economists at the foundation, a Washington-based non-partisanresearch organization, attributed the lack of progress to:   _The 1986 Tax Reform Act, which took away or reduced severaldeductions to finance lower rates, and tax increases enacted in1982 and 1984. Although the big 1986 overhaul meant lower rates formost individuals, in many cases the reduced rates were more thanoffset by loss of deductions.   _Social Security taxes have grown faster than the economy in the1980s. In 1981 a worker paid Social Security tax of 6.65 percent ofthe first $29,700 earned, or a $1,975 tax. This year, the tax is7.51 percent of the first $48,000, or a maximum $3,605.   _State and local taxes have risen steadily through the decade,in part to pay for a reduction in federal programs.   Meantime, a group opposing any excise-tax increase to cut thebudget deficit released a study indicating that over the past 10years the share of all federal taxes falling on the poor has risenby 12 percent while the burden on upper-income Americans hasdropped by 4.3 percent.   The 50 percent of taxpayers considered to have middle income _between $20,000 and $60,000 _ saw a 3.4 percent rise in their shareof the burden. Those with incomes under $20,000 constitute aboutone-third of the population; those over $60,000, about one-sixth.   The Coalition Against Regressive Taxation, whose members includestate and local government officials, truckers, and the tobacco andalcohol industries, said any increase in taxes on gasoline,cigarettes, wine, liquor or beer would worsen that disparity, sinceexcise levies are acknowledged to fall more heavily on those withless income.   Tax Foundation economists calculate Tax Freedom Day by summingup the total of taxes collected by federal, state and localgovernments, including those paid by businesses, and dividing thatamount among workers. If every dollar earned this year were claimedby governments until all taxes were paid, the average worker wouldbe paid up by quitting time on May 4.   At this time last year, the foundation forecast a 1988 TaxFreedom Day of May 5, which would have been the latest ever.Economists now have looked back over the year and recalculated thatlast year's date was May 3. But 1988 was a leap year, meaning theaverage worker had to put in 124 days on the job to pay taxes, thesame as is projected for this year.   The foundation has calculated Tax Freedom Day all the way backto 1930, when the magic date was Feb. 13. It reached April 3 in1950, April 28 in 1970 and May 1 in 1980. The earliest date in thisdecade was April 28, 1984.   Federal taxes will take one hour and 47 minutes out of theaverage worker's eight-hour day this year, up one minute from lastyear. State and local taxes will claim 56 minutes, same as a yearago.   The rest of the work day will be spent this year paying for:housing one hour and 25 minutes, up one minute; food and tobacco 59minutes, up a minute; transportation 40 cents, unchanged; medicalcare 39 minutes, unchanged; clothing 24 minutes, up one minute;recreation 20 minutes, down two minutes, and all other, includingeducation, savings and religion, 50 minutes, down two minutes.</TEXT></DOC>
