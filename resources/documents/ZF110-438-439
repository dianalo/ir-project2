That might seem to be a question that nobodyshould have to ask, especially at a time when Steve Jobs is making computercompanies newsworthy again.andP;  But we don't think the answer is so obviousanymore, because the rapid advance of semiconductor technology is making someprofound changes in the division of labor between computer companies andtheir most important suppliers.andM;We'd argue, in fact, that a company like intel is as much a computer companyas a semiconductor company, not because it derives 30% of its revenues fromboard and system products but because its microprocessors incorporate so muchof the system design.andM;This somewhat theological line of inquiry seems especially pertinent inconsidering the rise of the chip-set industry, which grew by sellingsemiconductor devices containing the pieces of system logic that aren'tcaptured by the microprocessor.andP;  At first, the emphasis was on using gatearray technology to collapse into a few large-scale chips some of thestandard functions that previously had to be implemented with dozens ofdiscrete logic devices.andM;Less is moreandM;Although the cost and time-to-market benefits of this higher order ofintegration were obvious, the chip-set approach didn't seem to change therelationship between buyer and seller.andP;  Chips and Technologies, whichpioneered the concept back in 1985, simply cloned the functions of 70-odddevices surrounding the microprocessor in the PC AT, a product that dozens ofcompanies were cranking out.andP;  Like discrete logic, the chip sets werestandard products sold off the shelf to all comers.andP;  Chips sold a lot ofthem.andP;  Its sales went from $13 million (in fiscal 1986) to almost  300million in four years.andM;Legos for grownupsandM;Unlike discrete logic, however, chip sets by their nature are highlyvulnerable to the design cycles and competitive forces of the finishedproduct.andP;  The same discrete devices, generally speaking, can be used inanything from a portable computer to a mainframe and in succeedinggenerations of those products as well.andP;  They are building blocks that can beused for just about anything.andP;  Competition among them hinges on processtechnology, distribution, and manufacturing volumes - not design.andM;Chip sets, on the other hand, are product-specific building blocks.andP;  As such,their makers are subject to the same slings and arrows that afflict thesystem world.andP;  Chip sets can be rendered obsolete overnight.andP;  They can alsobe cloned, as Chips discovered once the market had confirmed the essentialrightness of founder Gordy Campbell's vision.andP;  Somewhere between 30 and 50companies, we gather, have probably entered the chip set business by now.andM;By reducing chip counts, enhancing performance, and cutting prices the newcompetition is grinding away at Chips' dominant position in personal computersystem logic.andP;  We think Chips has been able to hold its own at perhaps twothirds of die market, gaining on some platforms while losing on others.andP;  Butpricing pressures have helped to put a crimp in profits even though salescontinue to climb (see the chart Page 4).andM;Not just another cloneandM;Mr.andP;  Campbell's response to what he calls &quot;this mindless race to create onemore chip set&quot; has been to take on even more of the system design role.andO;Rather than wait for a standard to be set by the computer industry as eachnew product generation arrives, Chips tries to get out early with its ownhighly integrated architecture that leaves little to the customer'simagination.andM;The new SCAT chip set, for example, requires only a processor and an I/O anddisk drive controller, plus a handful of discrete logic, to make a complete386 personal computer.andP;  For the 286, which originally required an eight-partset of chips, SCAT cuts the count to one.andM;Chips has a chip set for every appetite, from laptop to super-server, and, aswe reported a couple of issues back, it is attempting to set the standard formultiprocessor machines.andP;  At the same time, it is trying to expandhorizontally by strengthening its position in peripheral chips such asgraphics controllers.andP;  Increasingly, it thinks in terms of system featureswhen it designs a chip set.andP;  All of which requires more breadth in systemdesign expertise than many of Chips' customers possess.andM;Really virtualandM;We don't mean to imply, by singling out Chips as an example, that it is theonly chip-set vendor going through this sea change.andP;  On the contrary, itseems clear that the only way for most of these companies to prosper is tothink like system companies and seek opportunities to provide innovations insystem design.andP;  We might call them &quot;virtual&quot; computer companies, to borrow aphrase from our venture friend Bill Davidow, meaning that their product isnot so much hardware as intellectual property.andM;Enter the dragonsandM;One reason for the transition is that most of these companies, like Chips,rely on outside foundries for wafer fabrication.andP;  As the verticallyintegrated companies - Intel, LSI Logic, Texas Instruments, and VLSITechnology, to name four - push into the market, they bring cost advantagesthat can only be offset by clever design.andM;Perhaps a bigger reason is the demand that is building up among &quot;real&quot;computer companies for ways to differentiate their products.andP;  After all, ifchip sets provide the architecture, what's left to contribute aside fromcabinet color and an advertising slogan?andM;One size fits allandM;One approach to the problem from the chip-set point of view is exemplified bythe strategy undertaken by S3, a new company we've mentioned a time or two.andO;S3 (standing for silicon subsystem) sees the issue facing chip-set customersas one of leveraging limited engineering resources across an ever-wideningrange of products.andP;  If there are ten product categories to be addressed,which doesn't seem unlikely these days, there have to be ten design teams toachieve any uniqueness at all.andM;S3's solution is to provide a single architecture for all ten products, onethat is flexible enough to cover a wide range of performance, bus structures,and operating systems.andP;  In theory, pressure to reinvent the wheel for everynew product will be lifted and a computer company will be free to concentrateon areas where its design effort can really pay off.andM;It's not necessary to impose an entirely new system architecture on the worldto create a successful virtual computer company.andP;  In fact, S3 can win even ifits design doesn't catch on widely if its individual chip sets - which willwork in any 486-based system - are good enough.andP;  The most popular approachwill be to specialize in a few areas of system expertise and attempt to getto market first with products that provide features and performance thatcan't be easily matched.andM;Doing something rightandM;This is the strategy that has propelled Cirrus Logic from obscurity torelative prominence in just two years.andP;  Founded in 1984 to develop a newdesign automation system, Cirrus absorbed losses totaling $20 million beforesales finally took off in fiscal 1989 (see the chart on this page).andP;  Whenrevenues more than doubled again this year to $85 million and earnings hit$15 million, it was clear that Cirrus was on to something.andM;What Cirrus President Mike Hackworth tries to do is to find aperipheral-device market that is both large enough to support high volumes ofcomponents and changing fast enough to provide an opportunity forarchitectural innovation.andP;  Then he takes a team of system engineers withrelevant experience, hooks them up with a  &quot;godfather&quot; customer willing toshare its future requirements, and comes up with a device that can take fulladvantage of an important technology transition.andM;The Conner connectionandM;Sounds great in theory, although we suspect it won't work as often as Mr.andO;Hackworth might like.andP;  So far, Cirrus has not equaled its first big hit, achip that put the entire disk controller function into one device and caughtthe wave as the 3.5-in.andP;  hard drive generation arrived.andP;  Cirrus still hassomething more than 80% of the market for disk controllers in portablecomputers, and Conner Peripherals, the godfather for this device, accountedfor 45% of sales in the last two years.andM;Cirrus has had some success also with graphics controllers and datacommunications products.andP;  But the population of chip-set or subsystemcompanies has been growing rapidly, and many of them target the sameopportunities that Cirrus sees.andP;  It doesn't take genius, after all, to figureout that data compression and error correction will soon be more important inpersonal computer storage systems.andM;Party timeandM;We counted at least four small companies presenting chip-set solutions toproblems like those at our Semiconductor Outlook Conference earlier thismonth.andP;  Cirrus has acquired a company with expertise in this area, and itsclose relationship with Conner Peripherals should help it stay ahead of  thepack.andP;  Its design technology, while not as fast as most gate arrayapproaches, gives it a die size advantage that ought to translate into aprice and performance edge.andP;  But in chip sets, as in computers, there is nosafe haven.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
