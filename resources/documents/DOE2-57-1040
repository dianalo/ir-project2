Spent fuel transfers betweenpools can be simulated under various constraints controlled by user input.In addition to simulating each pool and ex-pool facility, WASTES canaccommodate up to ten other storage facilities of four different types:federal interim storage (FIS), monitored retrievable storage (MRS), auxiliaryplants, and repositories. Considerable flexibility is allowed for theuser to specify system configuration and priorities for fuel receipts.In addition, the WASTES computer code simulates very detailed (assembly-specific)movements of spent fuel throughout the waste management system. Spentfuel characteristics that are tracked by WASTES for each movement are:discharge year and month, number of assemblies, weight of uranium (MTU),exposure, original enrichment, and heat generation rate (calculated fromthe preceding characteristics). Data for the WASTES model is based uponthe DOE reactor-specific spent fuel data base, which is developed andmaintained by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In additionto the spent fuel characteristics, this data includes reactor location,type, transportation access, and historical and projected discharge dataon the number of fuel assemblies. 8 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
