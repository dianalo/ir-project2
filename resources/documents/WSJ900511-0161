Borjas (&quot;The U.S. Takes the Wrong Immigrants,&quot;editorial page, April 5) is certainly right that the U.S.could select immigrants who would make even greater economiccontributions than does our current system. And it is worthhis saying that most immigrants get admitted as relatives ofU.S. residents rather than because of their merits. But Mr.Borjas's article also leaves some unfortunate and incorrectimpressions, and invites dangerous misinterpretation.   It is easy to infer from the article that less-skilledimmigrants have a negative economic effect. But nothing inMr. Borjas's recent book shows that to be true. He shows onlythat they make a less positive contribution than the moreskilled.</LP><TEXT>   He writes that the immigrants from some countries are lessproductive than those from others. To some readers this willsuggest that the U.S. should discriminate on the basis oforigin. But discrimination on the basis of education wouldaccomplish exactly the same effect.   Mr. Borjas also writes that the immigrants from somecountries are more likely to be on welfare than others. Herehis data are unsound because they do not hold constant thelength of time in the country. It is not informative thatimmigrants from Germany who came on average many years agoare better off than recent immigrants from Vietnam.   More generally, focusing on origins, or even oncharacteristics of individuals, fosters divisiveness anddirects attention away from the key social decision -- thetotal number of immigrants admitted. A meaningful increase inthe total number would have a more beneficial effect thanalmost any conceivable alteration in the selection system.   Mr. Borjas also says, &quot;Including illegals, more immigrantswere admitted during the 1980s than in any other decade inAmerican history.&quot; From 1901 to 1910, 8.8 million immigrantsarrived. In the 1980s, 5.9 million immigrants arrivedlegally. For the recent flow to be even as large as theearlier flow, the number of illegal entrants would have to belarger than experts (e.g. Robert Warren, head of statisticsfor INS and a reliable student of the subject) estimate itcould be.   But even if the flow now were historically larger, sowhat? What matters is the flow relative to our populationsize, and that more immigrants are good rather than bad forus -- all kinds of immigrants. The most important change wecan make is to allow more to come.   Julian L. Simon   Professor of Business Administration   University of Maryland   College Park, Md.   ---   Prof. Borjas clearly had my parents in mind. My fathercame from Russia in 1919, my mother from Poland the nextyear. Neither had a pair of shoes when they arrived. Myfather was one of nine children, my mother one of 11. Mymother never learned to write English, but she could handlemovie magazines by the time she was 40. We lived in back of acandy store in Hoboken, N.J., where I became interested inforeign languages by learning to say &quot;Please don't hit meagain]&quot; in six of them.   Our house, which was one large room, had no books, norecords, no signs of intellectual commitment. My parents werepoor, ignorant and never spent a minute in an American schoolof any kind. Given Prof. Borjas's standards, they would notbe welcomed to America, nor would their children representany particular dividend for this country. This pair ofcompletely unskilled and uneducated immigrants, however, hadsomething in them that will never appear in any statisticalanalysis of what makes a &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; immigrant. Thereare characteristics and values that cannot be charted. Thisilliterate woman could read a report card somehow, and I willnever forget the pain of disappointment when she did not seethe letters she wanted, nor the knot in my stomach when shesaid, &quot;Your brother did better.&quot;   Sol Gittleman   Professor of German   Provost   Tufts University   Medford, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
