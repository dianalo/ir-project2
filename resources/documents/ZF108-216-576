(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>X Windows is a windowing system for the 1990s.andP;  Networks of the future arenot going to be comprise of a single type of workstation or operating system.andO;As businesses automate every facet of their organizations, they find thatdifferent users require different systems and applications for differentneeds.andP;  X provides a method of integrating those systems under one common,intuitive graphical interface.andP;  Here's a look at the inner workings of X andsome of the products availiable.andM;Windows, or just plain X to theandM;initiated, was developed as theandM;result of a combined effort by two groups at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology  (Cambridge, Mass.).andP;  The computer science department needed somesort of debugging environment, whereas Project Athena was attempting tonetwork workstations across campus.andP;  Since DEC and IBM were the primarysponsors of Project Athena, the designers of any kind of operating system hadto allow for varying types of hardware.andP;  Between them, the two groups decidedthat a windowing system would be optimal for both their requirements, andmost of the eventual development was done at Athena.andM;The critical requirement in designing X was that it be independent of anynetwork operating system or hardware.andP;  Furthermore, the designers decidedthat although they were developing a graphical system, they didn't know whatthey wanted it to look like.andP;  There is, therefore, no standard user interfacebuilt into X. Instead, users can design one with the look and feel they'rehappiest with.andM;if X doesn't specify any hardware, operating system or interface, what doesit do? Basically, X provides the user with a set of tools to build aninterface that will allow them to view several applications at once, as longas those applications are written to X specifications.andP;  As with anApplications Programming interface (API), all developers have to do isconform to X, and they can produce applications that can be viewed from any Xterminal, regardless of the underlying network.andM;The X protocol is the base level protocol that conducts communicationsbetween X servers and clients.andP;  The definitions of server and client in X aresomewhat reversed from the traditional networking definitions.andP;  Intraditional lingo, a network server is somewhere out on the network andserves information to the user locally.andP;  In X jargon, the server is thedisplay terminal at which the user sits, and the client is the application,which can reside anywhere on the network.andP;  The X protocol orchestratescommunications between the software residing on the server and the clientapplication.andM;On top of the X protocol, is Xlib, a library that deals with graphicalobjects like pixels, lines, and arcs.andP;  The library, written in C, would beimpossible to manipulate without X Intrinsics.andP;  X Intrinics is the toolkitthat, using the elements of Xlib, defines graphical entities like scroll barsor menu structures.andP;  These entities are commonly called widgets, whichcomprise the Xtoolkit.andP;  More on this later.andM;All these components of the X standard are distributed by MIT, which owns acopyright on the source code but makes it available to anyone who wants it.andO;X actually went through eight noncommercial releases, before the firstcommercial release, X/10.andP;  (MIT skipped one when numbering the releases.)andO;Development of X, now at X/11, continues under the X Consortium, anorganization of about 60 members and affiliates, formed in early 1988.andM;Although it was designed to be operating system independent, X istraditionally associated with UNIX.andP;  Keep in mind that it was developed tonetwork DEC and IBM workstations, both of which supported UNIX, so that'swhere the initial implementation was done.andP;  Furthermore, UNIX is amultitasking operating system, and DOS is not.andM;It's slowly becoming possible to integrate DOS environments with X Windows,although it involves sacrificing some functionality.andP;  The basic limitation isthat DOS is a single-tasking operating system, and one of the key advantagesof X is that is allows the user to have several applications open and runningin different windows on the same terminal.andM;There are ways to circumvent these limitations, however.andP;  Several companieshave products that allow a PC to be used as an X terminal, not unlike 3270terminal emulation, Where the user can hot-key between the two.andP;  There arealso rumors that vendors are developing an X server that will run under DOS,as well as a X server board that will plug into a PC.andP;  The other solution isto run UNIX on a PC.andP;  There are a number of UNIX environments that have DOSemulations.andM;Ironically, one of the greatest advantages to X-its flexibility-is also oneof its greatest drawbacks.andP;  Since X doesn't specify a graphical userinterface, the developer has to construct one for his or her application.andP;  Abad user interface can kill an application, despite its underlyingfunctionality.andP;  A good interface, on the other hand, is difficult and timeconsuming to design.andM;The development cycle for a user interface is extremely lengthy, according toAubry Harden, director of marketing at Integrated Computer Solutions(Cambridge,  Mass.),  the sponsors of Xhibition, the X Windows trade show.andO;&quot;To actually build an interface, developers have to write tons of code, thendebug that code,&quot; says Harden.andP;  &quot;Then when they finally bring it up theyrealize how ugly it is.andP;  When they finally construct one they do like, theysend it to the marketing group, which vetoes it and sends it back to bechanged.andP;  The two rarely agree before the ship date, with the result that theinterface is rarely as good as it is should be.&quot;andM;Although the motivation behind developing X seems to have been mainly to makethe user's life easier, there's no reason to keep the developers miserable.andO;Several groups have written Graphical  User Interfaces (GUIs) for X, sodevelopers can construct their applications with a prefab interface.andP;  Thereare, of course, the usual wars raging about which GUI is better, but keep inmind that these are not standards, nor do they prevent you from developingyour own GUI.andM;It's at the toolkit level that a developer implements an interface.andP;  Thereare two layers to the X toolkit, the Intrinsics layer and the widgets layer.andO;The goal in developing X was to have the Intrinsics layer remain standard andhave different widgets developed.andP;  For example, Project Athena put out awidget set as did Hewlett-Packard and Sony, all of which were in the publicdomain.andP;  None of them, however, were really commercial quality.andP;  Even DEC'sproprietary DECWindows wasn't really suitable for commercial applications,not to mention that it wasn't easily available for other architectures, whichdefeated the purpose of X.andM;At the same time as these interfaces were trickling out, the UNIX wars werealso raging full force.andP;  The Open Software Foundation (OSF) decided todevelop a standard GUI for X, and received about 40 proposals for GUIs thatwould work on X. The OSF picked a combination of technology DEC,HP, andMicrosoft, and with some additional in-house development came out withOSF/Motif.andM;The opposing camp of Sun Micro-systems and ATandamp;T were not sitting idle duringthis time.andP;  Jointly, they came up with a specification for OpenLook, althougheach did their own private implementation.andP;  Sun, instead of basing theirimplementation on the nonexclusive, standard  Intrinsics  layer, based it onthe lower level Xlib.andP;  By doing this, Sun protected its heavy investment inSunView, a windowing system for Sun workstations.andP;  The goal is to haveprograms written for SunView, but with OpenLook specifications as well, sothat they can be easily ported to X. Sun placed its toolkit in the publicdomain, so anyone can use it.andP;  ATandamp;T took a different tack and developed itstoolkit, XT plus, based on X Intrinsics, which also implements the OpenLookspecifications.andM;Users can therefore choose either Motif or OpenLook or implement their ownGUI if they desire.andP;  So far, Motif seems to be the more popular of the two.andO;It has an attractive, three-dimensional interface, and best of all, resemblesIBM's OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  DOS users, therefore, have a shorterlearning curve and an easy migration path to X.andM;OpenLook has been slower in gaining acceptance.andP;  &quot;It's not as pretty,&quot; saysHarden.andP;  &quot;The fact that OpenLook isn't based on a standard interface has also  hurt  i t  a  lot.&quot; Furthermore, Sun, with its own SunView windowingsystem to think of, isn't really that committed to X. Motif, on the otherhand, has the backing of the OSF, HP, DEC, and IBM.andM;The Bigger PictureandM;What does X mean for the future? Mainly, it's another step in integrating theamalgam of systems found in most businesses today.andP;  UNIX is just breaking outof its gearhead stereotype and gaining acceptance in the business world.andP;  Themain obstacle to that acceptance is UNIX's notorious command line  interface.andO;In reality, the interface is not much more complex than DOS',  but perceptionis everything.andP;  There are droves of commercial applications available for DOSthat insulate the user from the command line.andP;  The advent of X may encouragedevelopers to build applications for UNIX as well, which will encourage usersto implement UNIX on their workstations or over their network.andM;X may also nullify the prospective battle between OS/2 and UNIX.andP;  With X,users can choose a system based on the applications they need withoutworrying about which operating system they have running of each workstation.andO;X will definitely make UNIX more accessible,&quot; says Harden.andP;  &quot;The graphiccapability insulates users from the nastiness of UNIX.&quot;andM;The next stage in the development of X is an interactive interface builderthat will let the developer sit at the display terminal and using a mouse,construct an interface complete with buttons, scroll bars, windows, and soon.andP;  The builder will then generate bug-free source code.andP;  There are severalof these interactive builders in development, including one from ICS.andM;X ProductsandM;Products developed for X, are of course, not limited to GUIs.andP;  There iseverything from desktop managers and X-based schedulers to a wide range of Xterminals.andP;  The most immediately significant for PC users are those productsthat allow them to access X applications from their PC.andP;  PC-Xview/16 fromGraphic Software System (Beaverton, Ore.) connects a DOS-based PC to anyUNIX-based workstation over Ethernet.andP;  Users can then share data with other Xusers and can hot-key between the two without interrupting the processing ofthe UNIX applications.andP;  The program requires a minimum of 640KB memory,although it can access up to 16MB of extended memory.andP;  It also requires EGA,VGA, or DGIS graphic capability.andM;Nor are Macintoshes left out in the cold; after all, the original friendlyinterface could hardly be excluded from the X family.andP;  White Pine Software(Amherst, N.H.) provides exodus, which turns the Mac into an X Windowsworkstation.andP;  exodus integrates X functionality right into the Mac worldwithout changing the interface that Mac users are used to.andP;  The product wasdeveloped in conjunction with DEC, and so it naturally supports DECWindows.andO;Any Mac terminal will support the standard X server display.andP;  Apple Computer(Cupertino, Calif.) has MacX, software which allows Mac users to launch anduse X applications.andM;You can't have X Windows without an X server.andP;  MIT supplies the X Servercode, and X terminal manufacturers like Dell (Austin, Texas), NCR (Dayton,Oh.), Network Computing Devices (Mountain View, Calif.), Visual Technology(Lowell, Mass.), and Human Designed Systems (Philadelphia, Penn.) to name afew, add their own features and bundle it with their X terminal hardware.andO;The terminal contains a processor and memory, as well as graphics andcommunication hardware.andM;Those users who want to integrate several types of systems with their owngraphical interface are not left to the vagaries of the X toolkit.andP;  Design/OAfrom Meta Software (Cambridge, Mass.) is a C language graphics developmenttool.andP;  it can be used to develop environments for Computer-Aided SoftwareEngineering (CASE), Computer-Aided Design/Engineering (CAD/CAE), orsimulation applications.andP;  It can also be used to create front ends fordatabases of telecommunication networks.andP;  Previously available for theMacintosh and MS-Windows, Design/OA is now available for X Windows.andP;  Theprogram remains interoperable across all three platforms.andM;IXI Limited (Cambridge, England) recently released version 2.0 of its desktopmanager, X.desktop.andP;  The new release is OSF/Motif-compliant and incorporatesadvanced object management capabilities.andP;  X.desktop, which in its initialrelease was suspiciously familiar to Macintosh users, still makes use oficons to help users manage their files and directories.andP;  The icons in the newversion have the same three dimensional look of OSF/Motif and PresentationManager.andP;  There is also a new client-server load leveling technology thatmakes the most efficient use possible of computing power.andP;  X.desktop wasdemonstrated in 18 booths at Uniforum in Washington.andM;With desktop managers in the offing, could office schedulers be far behind?andO;Synchronize from Crosswind Technologies (Felton, Calif.) is an X-compliantworkgroup management package that keeps a master schedule of all the users inthe office and informs them of meeting conflicts.andP;  The program also includesTo-Do lists, Reminders, Pop-Up notes, and permission control so thatindividual users can protect their schedules from prying eyes.andM;AIM Technology (Santa Clara, Calif.) came out with the first benchmark for XWindows early this year.andP;  Suite X provides both detailed and summary analysisof X Windows system and server performance, taking into account all thefactors that affect performance such as users, applications, window managers,and networks.andP;  There are three levels of testing and reporting: functions,applications, and overall system performance.andM;UNIFORUM FLASHandM;Uniforum, the UNIX trade show, was happening in blustery Washington, D.C.andP;  aswe went to press.andP;  We have highlighted the X Window events.andM;Hummingbird (Markham, Ont.), part of the Canadian contingent at Uniforum,introduced a new version of HCL-eXceed, its X Window server for DOS-basedPCs.andP;  HCL-eXceedPlus software lets users access X applications anywhere onthe network.andP;  Users can have 286, 386, and 486 machines running DOS on aTCP/IP network.andM;The new release is a protected mode version of the original, allowing usersto access 16MB of memory, which removes the 64KB memory limitation on thesize of screen image or font files.andP;  While HCL-eXceedPlus is aimed atengineering, CAD/CAM, and other extremely techie applications, HCL-eXceed isstill available for users with less than 1MB of memory.andM;Graphic  Software  Systems (Beaverton,  Ore.)andP;  showed PC-Xview/16, its Xterminal emulator for DOS-based machines.andP;  The company also announced itsplans to support three new network interfaces: PC-NFS from Sun Microsystems(Mountain View, Calif.), WIN/TCP from The Wollongong Group (Palo Alto,Calif.), and Net/One from Ungermann-Bass (Santa Clara, Calif.).andM;PC-Xview/16 allows users to hot-key between a DOS and an X Windows session,without interrupting the processing of the UNIX application.andP;  PCXviewsupports EGA and VGA graphics as well as the company's own Direct GraphicsInterface Standard  (DGIS).andP;  PC-Xview/16 supports up to 16MB of memory andsupports industry-standard window managers such as OpenLook from ATandamp;T andOSF/Motif.andM;GSS also released Extensible Virtual Toolkit (XVT) version 2.0, a library ofC functions that provides a common interface for developers writingapplications for a variety of graphical user interfaces.andP;  XVT 2.0 addsOSF/Motif support.andP;  Also new are color addressability, text editing,dynamically modifiable menus, child windows, and Universal Resource Languagecapability.andM;San Diego, Calif.-based Advanced Graphics Engineering (AGE) will port its XWindows server software, Xoftware, to Advanced Micro Devices' (Sunnyvale,Calif.) 32-bit RISC processor, the Am29000 or more succinctly, the 29K.andO;Xoftware has long been used by several X terminal manufacturers.andP;  Recently,AGE came out with Xoftware TIGA, a version compatible with Texas InstrumentsGraphics Architecture (TIGA).andP;  The product, aimed primarily at systemintegrators, allows users to access X applications from their DOS-basedmachines.andM;AGE also puts out a nifty 10-page glossary of X terms, defining everythingfrom ancestors to z format.andM;Sun Microsystems will offer the XView toolkit for OpenLook for use on UNIXworkstations from DEC, HewlettPackard, and IBM.andP;  Application developers canstandardize on a single graphical user interface for all UNIX workstations,namely XView.andP;  Sun and ATandamp;T released a list of third-party vendors who havepledged their support to OpenLook.andP;  OpenLook will be bundled with the UNIXSystem V release 4.0.andM;Data General (Westboro, Mass.) will bundle Looking Glass from Visix Software(Arlington, Va.) with its Aviion family of workstations, servers andmultiuser systems.andP;  Data General will also offer Directory Shell from Visixon all its file servers.andP;  Looking Glass is fully compliant with OSF/Motif,and as such is an icon- and mouse-driven graphical interface.andP;  It runs onUNIX-based workstations and X terminals.andP;  Directory Shell provides amenu-driven interface to UNIX for character-based terminals.andM;Locus Computing of Inglewood, Calif.andP;  released Merge version 2.0, whichintegrates DOS and UNIX on a single 386 or 486-based computer.andP;  The newversion includes Xcrt, an X client that lets users run DOS graphics in an XWindow.andP;  Merge also now permits full-screen zoom for EGA and VGA graphics.andO;DOS, UNIX, and X applications can be run on the same screen.andP;  There is mousesupport for DOS and UNIX, revised documentation, and DOS 3.3 support.andP;  UNIXSystem V release 3.2 and 4.0 include the necessary extensions for Merge 2.0in the source code.andP;  Merge is also available from Locus for SCO's UNIX 3.2and Intel UNIX 3.2.andM;Users of X terminals from Network Computing Devices (Mountain View, Calif.)andO;can now communicate over serial lines using the company's new XRemotesoftware.andM;XRemote was developed specifically for multilevel data compression in the XWindow environment.andP;  Because XRemote is optimized for the demands ofbit-mapped workstations and windowing environments, it provides 10 times theperformance of the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP).andP;  At minimum, a V.32full-duplex 9600-baud modem should be used with XRemote.andM;X AppliedandM;Not all X-related announcements centered around graphical user interfaces andhardware platforms.andP;  Some included useful applications you can use today.andO;Frame Technology (San Jose, Calif.) announced its FrameMaker publishingsoftware will work under the Santa Cruz Operation's (SCO) Open Desktop, whichbegan shipping this month.andP;  Open Desktop, for 386 and 486 systems, allowsusers to incorporate X Windows, TCP/IP, and UNIX in a single softwareenvironment.andP;  The company hopes to make the widely used FrameMaker accessibleto the large installed base of PCs.andP;  FrameMaker 1.3X will be available duringthe first quarter of 1990.andM;Island Graphics in San Rafael, Calif.andP;  introduced several publishingapplications that run under OSF/Motif.andP;  Island Write, island Paint, andIsland Draw were the first in the Island Office series and were shown on HP'sworkstations in both Island Graphics' and HP's booths.andM;Island Write includes both writing and layout tools for putting togetherdocuments such as newsletters.andP;  The word processing features include searchand replace and spell checking in four languages.andP;  Island Draw is anobject-oriented illustration program that lets users create diagrams andcharts that can be imported into Island Write documents.andP;  Island Paint letsusers edit scanned images to be imported into Island Write documents.andM;IXI Ltd.
