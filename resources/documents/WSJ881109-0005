Under the agreement, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. can negotiate a merger or reorganization of United Savings Association of Texas. The company's board must approve any actions taken by regulators and must resign or elect directors designated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.    The company, based in Houston, said that if regulators restructure or recapitalize United Savings, the parent company will probably lose all the value of its ownership in the thrift, and United Financial Group's common and preferred holders would receive little or nothing for their stock.    United Savings had about $6 billion in assets and negative regulatory capital of $8.6 million as of July 31. United Financial had a negative net worth of $86.5 million as of July 31. </TEXT></DOC>
