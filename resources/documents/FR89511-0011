Background</ITAG>On December 11, 1987, we published a proposed rule to allow reimbursementfor custodial conditions for which medically necessary acute hospital careis required. This amendment reiterates the proposed rule, further delineatingthat only acute-care hospitals are impacted, as diagnosis-related groupsare not in use for long-term hospitals. Additionally, this amendment extendscoverage for custodial patients for medical supplies, durable medical equipmentand limited physician visits when otherwise covered within existing Programrequirements.This amendment is being adopted for two reasons_because of implementationof a DRG-based (diagnosis-related group) payment system for CHAMPUS inpatienthospital admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1987 (published inFR Doc. 87-19684, September 1, 1987) and to clarify the position of theDepartment of Defense with respect to a court decision which held the custodialcare provision unsupportable in cases involving medically necessary inpatienthospital care on the basis that there was no distinction between the termsdomiciliary and custodial. In this background section, we clarify the distinctionbetween custodial and domiciliary care through a historical overview ofCongressional changes to the Program.The 1956 legislation which initially authorized civilian health care formilitary dependents, Pub. L. 84-569, did not contain an exclusion of custodialcare. Rather, benefits were more limited. The law excluded domiciliarycare and the treatment of nervous and mental disorders, chronic diseasesand elective medical and surgical treatments. Power was vested in the Secretaryof Defense, after consultation with the then Secretary of Health, Educationand Welfare (currently Health and Human Services), to grant exceptionsto these exclusions for up to 12 months of treatment in special and unusualcases. Care in civilian facilities was also generally limited to inpatienttreatment for active duty dependents.The express purpose of the changes enacted by the Military Medical BenefitsAmendments of 1966 was to ``provide improved benefits for military familiesalong the line of those provided other citizens over the (preceding) decade.''Consistent with this intent, the 1966 amendment eliminated the exclusionof the treatment of chronic diseases, representing a significant programexpansion. This expansion was tempered, however, by the newly adopted exclusionof custodial care, an exclusion which was also consistent with other publicand private health care plans. The custodial care exclusion was intendedas a limitation on the expansion of benefits represented in part by theinclusion of the treatment of chronic diseases as a benefit.One of the stated purposes of the 1966 amendment was to ensure that theDepartment of Defense retained sufficient administrative flexibility totailor the Program's benefit package to meet the determined needs of theUniformed Services. Thus, broad discretion was granted to the Secretaryof Defense in the management and direction of the civil health benefitsprogram.In developing the 1966 amendments, Congress looked to the Federal EmployeesHealth Benefits Program for guidance in the development of the benefitspackage. The history of the Program's development (Military Medical BenefitsAct of 1966, report dated March 31, 1966, Explanation of the Amendment_Purposeof the Bill) states in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">The bill would improve the level of benefits provided by eliminatingthe specific listing in the law of the types of care permitted and substitutingtherefor authority to provide hospital care up to the level of the highestoption of the Government-wide plan covering the larger number of civilianemployees under the Federal Employees' Health Benefits Act. The Departmentof Defense would have the authority to contract for care subject only tothe limitation that the benefits provided could not exceed the high optionof the most popular Government-wide civilian program. The bill furtherprovides that benefits shall not be less than those provided under suchcivilian high option programs on July 1, 1966.</ITAG>Thus, the bill gives the Department of Defense the flexibility to improvebenefits in the future as health benefits expanded for other Governmentpersonnel and, at the same time, provides a floor on benefits so that theycould not be reduced in the future by arbitrary administrative directive.The legislative history goes on to specify that the types of care intendedfor the various beneficiaries are to be modeled after the high-option BlueCross-Blue Shield plan available to Federal civilian employees. In January1966, the contract between the U.S. Civil Service Commission and NationalBlue Cross and Blue Shield Associations defined custodial care as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Custodial Care'' is the provision of room and board_with or withoutroutine nursing care, training and personal hygiene and other forms ofself-care, or supervisory care by a doctor_for a person who is mentallyor physically disabled as a result of retarded development or body infirmityand who is not under specific medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatmentto reduce his disability and to enable him to live outside an institutionproviding custodial care.</ITAG>The Government-Wide Service Benefit Plan brochure published by the U.S.Civil Service Commission in January 1966 defined custodial care with substantiallythe same language. It also amplified that language with some additionalexplanation of the custodial care exclusion:<ITAG tagnum="21">Custodial care, which is the provision of room and board_with or withoutroutine nursing care, training in personal hygiene and other forms of self-care,or supervisory care by a doctor_for a person who is mentally or physicallydisabled as a result of retarded development or body infirmity and whois not under specific medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatment to reducehis disability to the extent necessary to enable him to live outside aninstitution providing medical care. This exclusion applies even when thecare is provided by a hospital. However, if confinement in a hospital isrequired because of a concurrent condition (whether related or not) whichdoes require medical or surgical treatment by a doctor, the differencebetween the normally allowable hospital expenses and the customary chargefor custodial care will be considered as allowable expenses.</ITAG>In 1970, the brochure definition was modified by deleting the last sentencewhich allowed for an exception for patients needing medical or surgicaltreatment by a physician.Initially, the term domiciliary care was defined to encompass the conceptof custodial care. In its early implementation of the 1966 amendments,the Department of Defense derived its definition of custodial care fromthe one used by the Social Security Administration's Medicare program.A number of custodial care determinations were reviewed under that definition.Between 1966 and 1974, CHAMPUS came under increasing Congressional scrutinyand criticism directed at escalating Program costs and administrative inefficiencies.A major review was undertaken in 1975-1977 to more consistently enforcethe intent of Congress as expressed in the law and to establish a betterdesigned, more uniform program which would be more akin to a contract ofinsurance and provide a greater degree of control over all program elements.The review culminated in issuance of the comprehensive Department of Defenseregulation for the operation and management of CHAMPUS.The provisions of the law relating to custodial care and domiciliary carewere examined as a part of the comprehensive review initiated in 1975.Based upon the legislative history discussed above, it was determined thatthese terms actually represent separate concepts and that new definitionswere required.In seeking a new definition, Program administrators looked to the FederalEmployee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The definition sought had tobe easily understood by beneficiaries and providers and had to be workablefor the routine processing of claims. The FEHBP provided a reasonable alternativesource and was compatible with the original intent of Congress in enactingthe 1966 amendments. The definition of custodial care ultimately adoptedwas derived from that source and is consistent with the concepts developedin that Program.The current custodial care definition has been in effect since 1977. Itis briefly described as care rendered to a patient (1) who is disabledmentally or physically and such disability is expected to continue andbe prolonged; and (2) who requires a protected, monitored, or controlledenvironment; and (3) who requires assistance in the essentials of dailyliving; and (4) who is not under active and specific treatment that willreduce the disability to the extent necessary to function outside of acontrolled environment. Once a custodial care determination is made, CHAMPUSbenefits are limited to one hour of skilled nursing care per day, prescriptiondrugs and medical supplies for their administration. CHAMPUS benefits maybe extended for otherwise covered services related to a medically necessaryadmission to an acute care hospital only if hospitalization is requiredfor treatment of a condition other than the one for which custodial careis being received (e.g., a broken leg as a result of a fall) or if thereis an acute exacerbation of the condition for which custodial care is beingreceived that requires active inpatient treatment.As shown in this historical review, the CHAMPUS custodial care provisionshave traditionally acted as benefit limitations to help contain costs ina Program that has had essentially no limits on medically necessary careand has very favorable cost-sharing provisions. Once a custodial care determinationwas made, the Program offered only limited benefits for the custodial condition.Other third-party plans have controls, absent in CHAMPUS, to contain excessivecosts that might otherwise occur with a chronic, long-term illness. Thesecontrols consist of limits on the number of days of hospitalization orlimits on physician or nursing visits. Some have substantial deductiblesand cost-sharing for inpatient care, and most have either a dollar or visitlimit on other care.On May 15, 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the District ofColumbia Circuit, <T3>Barnett </T3>v. <T3>Weinberger</T3>, 818 F. 2d 953 (DC Cir. 1987), in reversing a districtcourt decision, held the CHAMPUS regulation invalid insofar as it purportsto treat medically-necessary patient care obtainable only in a hospitalas excluded custodial care. The Court stated the specific issue beforeit to be ``whether the regulations characterizing medically-essential hospitalservices as excluded `custodial care' comport with the statutory provisionon that subject.'' The Court held, after analyses of the legislative historyand relevant case law, ``that the challenged CHAMPUS regulation, as writtenor applied, is invalid insofar as it purports to treat medically necessarypatient care obtainable only in a hospital as `excluded custodial care.'''In reaching the foregoing conclusion, the Court relied heavily upon ananalysis of the relevant legislative history. The original 1956 legislationexcluded domiciliary care, but not custodial care. The Court found significantthe original concept of domiciliary care as not excluding hospitalizationwhich is medically essential because it ``sheds important light upon themeaning of `custodial care' when the latter was inserted into the exclusionarysection in 1966.'' The Court noted that the 1966 amendments were characterizedgenerally as benefit enhancements. Based upon its understanding of thelegislative history, the Court concluded that ``it would be highly anomalousto suppose that by this language (excluding `custodial care') Congressdesigned an exclusion of necessary medical services from basic CHAMPUSbenefits.''The Department of Defense does not agree with the rationale of the Courtin this regard. For other reasons, it has chosen not to appeal or seekother relief from the decision as it applied in that particular case. TheCourt stated that the broad-gauged reading of the statutory exclusion ofcustodial care is antithetical to the general statutory purpose of enhancingbenefits. We do not believe, however, that the Court gave a true pictureof the context of the custodial care exclusion. As is clear from the historicaldiscussion above, the 1956 Dependents' Medical Care Act contained an exclusionof domiciliary care. It did not specifically exclude custodial care. Rather,it excluded all care for chronic conditions, a much broader exclusionaryconcept than that of custodial care. This fact was not discussed by theCourt. It has significance because it gives a better picture of the basisfor the custodial care exclusion in the 1966 amendment. In 1966, Congressremoved the exclusion for care for chronic conditions and substituted theexclusion of custodial care. Contrary to the Court's conclusion that thecustodial care exclusion did not enlarge the existing exclusion of domiciliarycare, what in reality was occurring was that Congress had removed a majorexclusion of necessary medical services for those with chronic medicalconditions. Under the 1956 law these conditions were not covered at all,irrespective of how medically essential the care was. The custodial careprovision was substituted for this exclusion. For this reason, we disagreewith the Court's conclusion that Congress did not intend to exclude necessarymedical service from basic CHAMPUS benefits in excluding custodial care.If the Court's conclusion were correct, there would have been no need forCongress to add the exclusion for custodial care. Congress simply couldhave removed the exclusion related to chronic conditions. When seen inthis context, the custodial care exclusion, as interpreted by the Departmentin 1977, represents a significant enhancement of benefits over the 1956law which excluded all care for chronic conditions. Nor do we agree withthe Court's characterizing domiciliary care and custodial care as essentiallysynonymous terms. The domiciliary care exclusion predates by several yearsthe custodial care provision and was contemporaneous with the exclusionof care for chronic conditions. Obviously, when Congress expanded benefitsby deleting the exclusion of care for chronic conditions and added theexclusion for custodial care, something in addition to the pre-existingexclusion of domiciliary care was intended. The custodial care exclusionwas included to temper the major expansion of benefits which the deletionof the exclusion of care for chronic conditions represented.However, because the ruling of the Court closely coincides with the implementationof DRGs, we are taking advantage of this change on custodial care to clarifyour position regarding the decision of the Court. With the implementationof DRGs for hospitals on October 1, 1987, the custodial care provisionrepresents a duplicative control on inpatient care in acute-care hospitals.Other provisions of the Regulation exist to help ensure the responsibleexpenditure of public funds. For example, the Regulation requires thatthe medical environment in which the services are performed be at the leveladequate to provide the required care. Services and supplies related toinpatient stays in hospitals or other authorized institutions above theappropriate level required to provide the necessary medical care will continueto be excluded. These controls are expected to effectively control utilization.The change clarifies the distinction between custodial and domiciliarycare. It provides coverage for medical supplies and durable medical equipmentfor the custodial patient when otherwise covered within existing Programrequirements. This final rule also provides coverage for a limited numberof physician visits once the patient has been determined custodial to permitpatient monitoring as appropriate. These provisions are considered cost-effectivein that availability of medical supplies and durable medical equipment,together with coverage for limited physician involvement, may precludean acute exacerbation of the custodial condition which might otherwiselead to the need for active inpatient treatment. The effective date is October 1, 1987, to coincide with the implementationof the rule on DRGs. Further revision of the custodial definition may beconsidered following evaluation of the expanded Home Health Care Demonstration(published in FR Doc. 88-12539, June 3, 1988) which has been extended throughfiscal year 1990 by the Defense Appropriation Act, FY 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Comments </ITAG>We received one comment, and that was from a DoD component. The commenterfelt that this change represented a significant increase in CHAMPUS benefitsand might result in substantial increases in overall costs. The commenterrecommended that legislation be sought to overturn or reverse the Courtdecision. We share the concerns of the commenter, especially in this climateof severe budget and resource limitations, but feel this approach, whencombined with implementation of diagnosis-related groups, will have anappreciable affect on cost-containment. We will monitor this area to seeif additional controls become necessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Impact </ITAG>Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354)requires that each federal agency prepare, and make available for publiccomment, a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues a regulationwhich would have a significant impact on a substantial number of smallentities. The Secretary certifies, pursuant to section 605(b) of Title5, United States Code, enacted by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.L. 96-354), that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small businesses, organizations or governmentjurisdictions. This final rule will have the impact of enhancing the scope of the CHAMPUSbenefit for medically necessary inpatient care. It distinguishes betweenthe terms custodial and domiciliary and provides an historical overviewto mirror the Congressional intent concerning the CHAMPUS range of benefits.The final rule adds coverage for custodial patients in the form of medicalsupplies, durable medical equipment and limited physician visits when existingProgram requirements are met. It will not involve any significant additionaladministrative burden on CHAMPUS beneficiaries or providers of medicalcare. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199 </ITAG>Health insurance, Military personnel, Handicapped.Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199, is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
