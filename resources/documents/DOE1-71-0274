<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-71-0274 </DOCNO><TEXT>During the last few years molecular genetics have provided &quot;tools&quot; inthe form of numerous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymorphisms to refineand strengthen the ability of genetic analysis of inherited disorders.Essentially, these &quot;tools&quot; involve haplotype reconstruction and linkagestudies. The best example of the increased ability in genetic analysisis man is given by the current studies on X-linked muscular dystrophies,which have taken advantage of the wealth of DNA polymorphisms mappedon both arms of the X chromosome. As a result of these studies, the threeX-linked muscular dystrophies, namely Duchenne (DMD), Becker (BMD), andEmery-Dreifuss (EDMD) have been assigned to restricted portions of theX chromosome. While the precise mapping of the mutations causing theformer two disorders has made possible the cloning of portions of theDMD and BMD gene(s), many other questions of relevant interest to humangenetics can be asked using DNA polymorphisms alone or in combinationwith more traditional tools of biochemical investigation and of somaticcell genetics. Using this approach, the author's group has contributedin the last three years to the mapping of two X linked muscular dystrophies,namely BMD and EDMD, to the study of new mutations in DMD and BMD, andfinally to the study of inactivation of the DMD, BMD, and EDMD loci usinga biochemical phenotype, which is apparently subject to Lyonization.</TEXT></DOC>
