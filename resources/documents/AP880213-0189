The U.S. Committee for Refugees, a refugee protection agency,and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, migration agency of the U.S.Jewish Community, urged the Reagan administration and Congress toinvoke emergency procedures of the 1980 U.S. Refugee Act forraising the total number of admissions.   The administration has been considering a shift of 5,000 fromthe Southeast Asian entry quota to provide for additional placesfor Soviet Jews and Armenians from Europe, said USCR Director RogerP. Winter in a statement.   Such a shift would have a ``disastrous impact'' on the safety ofVietnamese ``boat people'' refugees fleeing to Thailand, Wintersaid. This is because temporary refugee entry into Thailand dependson prospects for resettlement elsewhere.   The government is also proposing to reallocate 4,000 entryplaces originally allocated for 1988 refugees from Africa, the NearEast and Latin America, Winter said.   The increased refugee flow from the Soviet Union and other bloccountries is ``a direct result of the foreign policy successes ofthis administration,'' said Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society officialKarl D. Zukerman in a telegram to Secretary of State George Shultz.   ``Such a challenge to our human rights and refugee policiescannot go unanswered, nor should the lives and dignity of one setof refugees be balanced against others,'' Zukerman said.</TEXT></DOC>
