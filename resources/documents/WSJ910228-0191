The February sweeps, one of four months when advertisingrates for local stations are determined by prime-timeratings, ended last night. Final results tabulated by A.C.Nielsen Co. are scheduled to be released today.</LP><TEXT>   The win, CBS's first in the period in six years, puts theCBS Inc. unit in a tie with Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'stelevision network for second place in the 1990-91 season,which ends April 14. The NBC network, a unit of GeneralElectric Co., holds a lead of only three-tenths of a ratingspoint over its competition.   According to network projections for the February sweeps,CBS captured about 13.4% of the U.S. homes with televisionsets. NBC followed with 12.9%, and ABC was last with 12.1%.The projections don't include last night's ratings, so thefinal numbers may fluctuate by 0.1 ratings point.   CBS was bolstered by special programs, includingretrospectives of long-canceled shows, including &quot;All in theFamily,&quot; &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; and &quot;Mary Tyler Moore,&quot; as well as a&quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation, &quot;Sarah, Plain andTall.&quot; But even without the specials, CBS would have turnedin a strong performance. Its regular series were watched by12.9% of the audience, an increase of 5% from last February.   The ratings shift reflects troubling trends at NBC, whichhas been the No. 1-rated network for five years. In theseason-to-date figures, NBC's ratings for its regularlyscheduled series plunged 13% to 13.1%. CBS's ratings for itsregular series rose 2% to 12.4%, and ABC dropped 5% to 12.5%.   Although ratings are important barometers for thenetworks, the figures that matter most to advertisers aredemographics, especially adults 18 to 49 years old. There,the networks are in a close race; NBC and CBS are tied with7.6% of the audience, and ABC is slightly ahead at 7.7%.   The CBS sweeps victory is some much-needed good news.Earlier this month, CBS Inc. reported a fourth-quarter lossof $156 million, the largest quarterly loss in the company'shistory. CBS said its network had an operating loss in thequarter and will have an operating loss in 1991. Someanalysts peg that loss at $125 million, largely because oflosses associated with CBS's $1.06 billion four-year MajorLeague Baseball contract.</TEXT></DOC>
