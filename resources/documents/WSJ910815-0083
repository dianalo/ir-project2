Quebec Superior Court Justice JeanJude Chabot last monthoverturned a Canadian law that bans tobacco advertising innewspapers and magazines. He said the ban wasunconstitutional because it violated tobacco companies' rightto free speech.</LP><TEXT>   The law was challenged by Imperial Tobacco Ltd., adivision of Montreal-based Imasco Ltd., and Toronto-basedRJR-Macdonald Inc., owned by RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. Thetobacco companies weren't immediately available for comment.   Health groups praised the government's decision.   The notice of appeal was filed by Justice Minister KimCampbell in the Quebec Court of Appeal in Montreal. Inannouncing the decision, Ms. Campbell said Quebec lawprohibits tobacco companies from advertising until the appealis heard. &quot;If tobacco products are advertised during thatperiod, companies run the risk of prosecution,&quot; she said.   But Colin K. Irving, an attorney for RJR-Macdonald,disagreed. Tobacco companies can legally advertise, Mr.Irving said, but given the threat of prosecution they maychoose not to do so.</TEXT></DOC>
