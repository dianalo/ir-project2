Both committees, one a parliamentary group and the other appointed by Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, absolved past and present governments of complicity in a series of illicit arms transactions uncovered over the past four years.    The findings, contained in reports made public at the end of last week, are likely to quiet reverberations from the arms scandals in the months leading up to Sweden's general election in September. The reports show that illegal arms trafficking took place during administrations of both the ruling Social Democrats and the non-socialist parties now in opposition.    Nonetheless, the appointed panel said the country's arms-export policies are &quot;not sufficiently adapted to reality&quot; and should be changed. Neutral Sweden has long banned arms sales to countries at war or likely to become engaged in conflict, even though it condones international weapons sales as a means of supporting a domestic defense industry.    &quot;The word hypocrisy has been raised here and, yes, there has been a lot of hypocrisy,&quot; said Olof Rydbeck, the panel's chairman, a former ambassador to the United Nations. &quot;There is a moral opinion which has been in conflict with security needs.&quot;    To get around that dilemma, the committee recommended that Sweden adopt a law permitting military exports &quot;when deemed necessary&quot; to maintain its domestic industry and when compatible with foreign-policy objectives. It also recommended that Sweden clarify its definition of war materiel governed by restrictions.    Mr. Rydbeck said the policy changes would enable future governments to make straightforward judgments about arms exports, without unnecessary or ambiguous constraints. One of the main criticisms contained in his committee's 280-page report is that past Swedish governments weren't consistent in how they treated arms sales since 1970, the period reviewed by the panel.    The commission also accused Swedish governments of a &quot;lack of vigilance,&quot; in monitoring arms exports. That criticism echoed the major complaint of the 48-page report issued by the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the Riksdag, or parliament.    Testimony by senior government officials, including Prime Minister Carlsson and his foreign affairs and trade ministers, &quot;strengthened&quot; that impression, the Riksdag committee said. Swedish arms sales must be cleared by the War Materiel Inspection Board, which is part of the Ministry of Foreign Trade.    One indication of the inspection board's failure, according to Mr. Rydbeck's committee, was that Carl-Frederik Algernon, a former war-materiel inspector, probably knew of an improper transfer of naval ordnance via Britain to Oman, an off-limits country. Mr. Algernon fell or jumped to his death in front of an underground train in early 1987, just as his name was creeping into the country's widening arms scandal. </TEXT></DOC>
