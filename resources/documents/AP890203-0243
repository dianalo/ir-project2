Eligio ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas. ``All we want isinformation that will help us do our job.''   The CFTC's authority to regulate the nation's commodity marketsexpires this year, and lawmakers expected fast action on legislationto reauthorize the commission through 1994, de la Garza saidThursday.   But their plans were altered by disclosure of a two-year,undercover FBI investigation of alleged widespread fraud and illegaltrading practices in the Chicago futures markets.   De la Garza said he contacted the FBI once the probe wasdisclosed several weeks ago seeking information that would help inthe committee's review of the CFTC reauthorization.   ``We haven't seen a thing,'' he said. ``Zilch at this time.''   The FBI acknowledged receipt of the request from de la Garza in aJan. 19 letter and said it had contacted his office today.   However, a spokesman said the bureau could not reveal the natureof the response and also refused to discuss the investigation ofallegations that brokers and traders cheated customers out ofmillions of dollars in deals on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange andChicago Board of Trade.   De la Garza assigned an agriculture subcommittee headed by Rep.Glenn English, D-Okla., to conduct its own investigation of theChicago trading scandal to see if the CFTC's regulatory authorityneeds to be strengthened.   Congressional critics have challenged the CFTC's effectiveness asa regulator and contend it should become part of the Securities andExchange Commission.   A CFTC spokeswoman said the Chicago investigation places an addedburden on proponents of an independent futures commission.   ``It puts us in a defensive position, and that's not the positionwe'd like to be in,'' spokeswoman Kate Hathaway said. ``But I thinkthe issue that is more important, rather than whether or not we haveto defend our image, is what this is doing to market confidence...''   ``We do have some very serious concerns _ and have reason forthem based on responses we're getting from people in the industry _about public perceptions of the markets and confidence in thosemarkets.''   The CFTC was established in 1974 to enforce federal laws relatingto commodities futures and options, including gold and silver.   The House and Senate agriculture committees have jurisdictionover the commission because futures and options trading originallyinvolved only agricultural commodities.   The Chicago Merc and Board of Trade account for thousands ofdollars given annually to members of Congress, either in honorariafor visits or in campaign contributions through political actioncommittees. However, English said financial contributions would notaffect lawmakers' handling of the exchanges' regulators.   Lawmakers agreed the congressional investigation was unlikely toresult in elimination of the commission and said the CFTC probablywould be reauthorized even with the delay.   ``If the investigation does not give us information that we needfor our reauthorization by the end of May, then we may have toproceed,'' de la Garza said. ``Then, if information is given thatmeans we need to change law, we can do that. But it would be betterfor all concerned if we did it all at one time.''   Separately, the CFTC voted unanimously Thursday to allow theChicago Mercantile Exchange to implement its planned Globexelectronic trading system, which would permit worldwide computerizedtrading during hours when the exchange floors are closed.   The commission authorized the exchange to begin using the systemthis fall.   Initially, trading would be limited to gold futures contracts,U.S. Treasury bills and various currencies, but all existing andsubsequent Merc futures and options contracts eventually would beeligible for trading through Globex, the CFTC said.   Supporters of the system say that in addition to making the U.S.exchange more competitive in world markets, electronic trading couldenhance the ability to police and detect trading abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
