Several companies offer gadgets that dialthe telephone for you.   The gizmos are the latest twist on computerized &quot;personalorganizers.&quot; In addition to storing names, addresses andphone numbers, the machines can generate the Touch-Tonenoises understood by most phones. By holding such a device upto a phone's mouthpiece and pressing a single button, usersdial the number they see on its liquid-crystal display.   Until lately, electronic dialers were simple devices thatenabled users of rotary phones to generate Touch-Tonecommands to their answering machines, for example. Addingthis dialing capability to the new electronic organizers&quot;seemed like a natural extension to both products,&quot; saysMelissa Stoll of Texas Instruments, which makes two dialers.   TI says its Pro Dialer should appeal to business travelersbecause it dials chains of numbers -- a boon to anyone whomust make long-distance calls by dialing an access number . .. then the desired phone number . . . then a credit-cardnumber. It also sports a clock that beeps to remind its ownerof appointments.   Sharp Electronics' Dial Master 450 offers a secret code toprotect sensitive phone numbers and a &quot;remark&quot; key thatallows users to add brief comments to each phone listing.Casio's Quick Dialer 700 keeps track of the time in 26cities, while the Auradex EZ200, from Aurora Impex, printsmailing labels. The machines list from $50 to $300, dependingon function.   As yet, no truly high-powered electronic organizer -- onethat swaps data with personal computers -- can also dial. ButSharp's Andrew Simon says the firm's Wizard product may addthe capability in a future version.                                                                                                          X-Ray `Fax' Machines   Aid Small-Town Hospitals   FOR CASH-STRAPPED hospitals, a radiologist is no longerout of reach.   Many small-town hospitals have their own X-ray machines,but must either share or do without a radiologist, thespecialist who interprets X-rays. While they save thedoctor's $200,000 salary, they often may wait a day or morewhile X-ray film is shuttled to another location fordiagnosis.   Now Discovery System, Overland Park, Kan., has come upwith a way to transmit complex X-ray images over regularphone lines without losing the detail necessary to diagnosepneumonia, fractures and other common ailments. Its FilmFAXsystem isn't a facsimile machine, but a $70,000 combinationof scanners, data compressors, modems and laser outputdevices. It can etch images on film or display them on avideo screen. X-ray technicians can use it to send an imageto another hospital in 70 seconds, allowing a radiologist tophone in a diagnosis in minutes.   At York Hospital in York, Pa., radiologist D. Randy Tabbuses FilmFAX to diagnose patients whose conditions mightrequire immediate treatment in the hospital's small outpostin Shrewsbury, 15 miles away. In four months of use, only twodiagnoses have been revised when compared with actual film, afar better performance than is possible with systems that usevideo cameras to transmit X-ray images, he says.   Video-based systems, such as those made by Image Data,Irvine, Calif., and Advanced Video Products, Concord, Mass.,focus mainly on CT-scan and MR-scan images, which containmuch less detail than X-rays.                                                                                                          Whetting User Appetites   With Trial Programs                                                                                                          SOFTWARE companies are offering customers new ways totest-drive -- and fall in love with -- their products.   Faced with increasingly leery buyers, more firmsdistribute &quot;demo disks,&quot; computer programs that give a feelfor a new product but don't let users perform key functions.Others offer flashy videos showing their product in action,while still others mail fully functional software &quot;for trialonly.&quot;   The latest marketing twist comes from a hardware firm, ofall places. Sun Microsystems is distributing an optical diskthat demonstrates the range of business software -- none fromSun -- that can run on its workstations. The company wants toconvince people that its machines are as versatile and usefulas PCs.   Sun says future versions will include real programs thatcan be tried out, then fully activated by calling thesoftware company and getting a password -- after paying forthe product. Ultimately, Sun hopes to ship a few disks withevery workstation, allowing users to buy as much software asthey want without leaving their desks.   &quot;This is a definite trend in software distribution,&quot; saysGail Bower of KnowledgeSet, which has a demo program on Sun'scurrent disk. &quot;You wouldn't buy a car without sitting in itand seeing how it drives. Now there may even be a way todrive that car right off the lot.&quot;   The development could spell good news for Drew Logan, aPennsylvanian who has applied for a patent on a new way toprotect software from copying. His method also requires usersto call the software company for a secret code, a step thatusers had never been asked to take before. Still, says RonPalenski of Adapso, an industry group: &quot;It's my sense thatcopy protection is and will remain a dead issue formass-distributed business software.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds andamp; Ends                                                                                                          SELECTRONICS announced a hand-held electronic version ofPhysicians' Desk Reference, a standard source of informationon drugs. . . . International Business Machines devised aprocess that allows circuit wires to &quot;heal&quot; certain defectsby themselves. Technicians don't even need to know where theglitches are.</TEXT></DOC>
