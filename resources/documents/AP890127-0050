Prosecutors said Chang Se-dong, ex-director of the Agency forNational Security Planning, formerly the Korean Central IntelligenceAgency, was charged with misusing official authority and otheroffenses.   The action came as part of government and parliamentary inquiriesinto allegations of human rights abuses and corruption under theauthoritarian Chun government. Chang was the highest-ranking formerofficial of that government to be charged so far.   The Agency for National Security Planning, the nation's mainforeign intelligence organization, played a major role in enforcingChun's tough rule and suppressing domestic opposition.   Chang, an ex-general who was one of the most powerful men in thenation under Chun, was whisked under guard to a prison outside Seoulafter formal warrants were issued. He had been held by prosecutorssince Wednesday for questioning.   Prosecutors said Chang strongly denied any wrongdong, insistinghe merely followed presidential orders. He was head of Chun'spresidential security before serving as intelligence chief from 1985to 1987.   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980, is in ruralexile at a remote Buddhist monastery. He apologized to the nation inNovember for abuses under his rule and went into exile.   The former president has denied any personal wrongdoing, but someof his relatives and aides have been convicted or charged withcorruption.   The charges filed against Chang were vague and relatively mild.They included illegal construction of a guest house and illegallyusing government office space.   Opposition groups have been demanding the arrest of Chang andseveral other former top Chun aides on human rights abuses. SouthKorean press reports said prosecutors had difficulty finding hardevidence to use against Chang.   The opposition contends President Roh Tae-woo's government is notmaking a sufficient effort to prosecute former Chun aides. Roh, aformer general and once close ally of Chun, is closely identifiedwith the ex-president in the eyes of many South Koreans.   The inquiry into the Chun regime has dominated South Koreanpolitics for months and hampered the government's efforts to achievebroad acceptance.   On Thursday, Chun refused to accept an order from a NationalAssembly special committee to testify on his role in the bloodysuppression of a 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju inwhich at least 200 people were killed.   The opposition is trying to use the Kwangju incident and otherlegacies of the authoritarian Chun government to weaken the Rohgovernment.   Opposition parties demanded this week that Roh keep an electionpromise to submit to a referendum on his rule. It is not clear ifRoh could win such a vote and he might be forced to hold electionsor step down if defeated.   Chun stepped down last February at the end of a seven-year termand was replaced by Roh.</TEXT></DOC>
