But the company's chief executive officer said he nonetheless was encouraged by the results.    On-Line, which develops and markets software for International Business Machines Corp.'s mainframe computers, posted a loss of nearly $1.5 million for the quarter ended Aug. 31. This compares with the company's late August projection of a $1.3 million loss before the special gain and with year-earlier net income of $1 million, or 15 cents a share. In the latest period, an extraordinary gain of $1.3 million from On-Line's purchase of its convertible debt made the net loss $185,000. Revenue was nearly flat at $18.7 million.    On-Line's chief, Jack M. Berdy, said that the loss for the first period, typically the company's most difficult quarter, narrowed from the fiscal fourth quarter's nearly $4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
