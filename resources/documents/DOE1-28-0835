The developments of the last yearshave led to a detector tube system which requires no pump or other additionalequipment to transport the hazardous compounds from the ambient atmosphereto the reagent layer inside the glass tube, because it works based ongaseous diffusion. These so-called direct reading diffusion tubes originallyhave been designed for measurements in the TLV-range over the periodof a work-shift (8 hours). Research in our lab has shown that some typesof the direct reading diffusion tubes can be exposed to the atmospherefor longer periods than 8 hours. Thus, the measuring range extends tosmaller concentrations so that it becomes possible to determine hazardoussubstances in the air of housing spaces. As examples, carbon monoxideand carbon dioxide determinations using the direct reading diffusiontube method will be explained.</TEXT></DOC>
