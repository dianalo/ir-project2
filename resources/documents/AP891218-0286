The Nader group, Center for Study of Responsive Law, charged ata news conference that the National Cooperative Bank has in effectused the subsidy from a low-interest $184.3 million federal loan toprovide the profits necessary pay its executives high salaries andprovide financial benefits to large cooperatives serving smallbusinesses rather than consumers.   In 1988, only 5 percent of the bank's 641 member cooperativesserved businesses rather than individuals, yet 30 percent of thebank's $199.6 milion in disbursements during the year were to thebusiness cooperatives, even though the law limits lending tobusiness cooperatives at 10 percent of the total, according to areport prepared for the Nader group by Seyoum A. Haregot.   The report also claimed the bank is not doing enough to servelow-income consumers or to stimulate the formation of newcooperatives.   Nader, in a forward to the report, said bank has abandoned its``one-cooperative, one vote'' principle in favor of a voting systemthat gives control of the organization to large, establishedcooperatives.   He said the bank's managers drove it from ``serving ultimateconsumers and toward a commercial banking model replete withexecutive emoluments, all the while enjoying its substantialtaxpayer subsidy.''   The federal subsidy to the bank totaled $119.5 million from 1982through 1988, according to Haregot's report. Salaries, benefits andbonuses to the bank's nine top executives totaled $1.3 million in1988, including $250,000 to Thomas S. Condit, president and chiefexecutive officer of the bank, the report said.   In a written response, Linda R. Lewis, corporate vice presidentof the bank, said the salaries were in line with the pay of otherfinancial institutions and said the bank has not been obligated tokeep its pay comparable to government salaries since itsprivatization.   She said the bank disagreed with Haregot's argument that it lenttoo heavily to business-owned cooperatives, saying that ``webelieve a cooperative owned by a business is in fact owned byultimate consumers.''   Also, the bank, at mid-1989, had a low-income loan portfolio of$131.8 million, she said.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, said he was ``deeply concerned'' about the ``failedpromise'' of the bank and said it would be ``placed on theoversight agenda of the committee.''</TEXT></DOC>
