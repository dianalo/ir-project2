Pressures from environmental groups have already spawned a race to recycle CFCs. General Motors Corp., for example, announced recently that its 10,000 dealers will install equipment to capture and purify CFC coolants from car air conditioners under repair, and other auto makers are taking similar steps.    But GE, saying it lacks a technology, has decided to release the coolant from 300,000 defective refrigerator compressors its dealers are repairing under a major recall program. GE isn't alone, of course, in venting CFCs, but its recent decision has environmental groups venting their anger, all the more so as some suppliers claim they can easily provide GE with the necessary recycling equipment.    &quot;If GM can do it, why can't GE?&quot; says William Walsh, an attorney for Public Interest Research Group, which is campaigning against CFC emissions. &quot;If it can design satellites and jet engines, it can design a CFC recycling system.&quot; Mr. Walsh says the group has written to GE's chairman, Jack Welch, and is trying to form protest groups of &quot;concerned&quot; owners whose refrigerators GE will repair.    For decades, repairmen have routinely released into the atmosphere the CFC coolant -- usually Du Pont Co.'s widely used Freon brand -- from automobile air conditioners and refrigerator compressors. But demands for an end to the practice are rising. At issue is the growing belief that CFCs deplete the atmosphere's ozone layer and thus contribute to increased levels of potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation.    An estimated 750 million pounds of CFCs -- synthetic compounds of chlorine, fluorine, carbon and, sometimes, hydrogen -- are used in the U.S. annually. Of that total, refrigerants account for 40%, insulators 28%, cleaning agents 20% and miscellaneous specialty products 12%.    According to a survey by New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, about a dozen small companies are selling equipment and services to recycle CFCs. But a GE spokesman says it hasn't found any of the technologies practical or economical. He says the machines being offered are too bulky and expensive for small repair shops to buy. &quot;We are working ourselves on some {recycling} systems which we aren't ready to talk about.&quot;    The spokesman doesn't estimate when GE's technology will be ready, but he says that meanwhile GE will offset the released refrigerant by &quot;somehow&quot; cutting its future use of CFC coolant by that amount.    The decision puzzles some companies that claim to already have what GE seeks. &quot;We have the technology that will meet their specific needs, and we can supply it in a matter of months,&quot; asserts Roger Dumais, sales manager of Thermaflo Inc., Springfield, Mass. He says the company has developed a prototype machine, a portable box-like unit, that can extract the coolant through a compressor's &quot;access ports&quot; or &quot;piercing valves.&quot; Mr. Dumais says the price of the units hasn't been decided, but it will be less than the roughly $2,200 that GM dealers will pay for their machines.    Mr. Dumais says GE looked at and rejected his company's technology, saying it was developing its own.    Recycling CFCs poses some technological challenges, but nothing that can't be overcome easily, engineers in the recycling industry say. One problem is that Freon, which exists both in liquid and gaseous states, depending upon pressure, has about one-tenth the viscosity of water and thus doesn't create a film, or cushion, to protect a pump's moving parts.    &quot;First time we used a pump to recover Freon, the pump rapidly disintegrated,&quot; says Richard Walker, vice president of Davco Manufacturing Co., Easton, Pa. He claims Davco has solved the problems using &quot;metallurgical and fluid tricks&quot; that he declines to discuss, saying the patent is still pending.    Ron Materniak, a Du Pont market planner, doubts that available machines can recycle refrigerator coolant back to original standards. Most can reduce the contaminants, he says, but if the refrigerant isn't sufficiently clean, it could burn out a motor. &quot;The refrigerator is less forgiving than the automobile,&quot; he says. &quot;GE obviously didn't feel comfortable with what's out there.&quot;    Recycling engineers agree that it's trickier to purify CFCs from refrigerator compressors than from car air conditioners, where the major contaminants are moisture and air; refrigerator-compressor motors add such impurities as acid and oil. But the technology exists to remove all of these contaminants through filtration and condensation, says Mr. Dumais of Thermaflo. &quot;What you need is some finesse.&quot;    The machines that will be installed at GM dealerships are boxy units, about 3 1/2 feet high, that can extract as much as 30 pounds of Freon from car air conditioners; an average auto has about 2.5 pounds of the coolant. A pump initially developed for the aerospace program reclaims the Freon, and the air and moisture are removed by passing the refrigerant through a series of valves and absorbent beads, all in the same unit.    Robert Bishop, who heads the SPX Corp. division that supplies the GM units, says the company also has developed similar machines for use on refrigerator compressors. These prototype machines were shown to GE Appliance division people a few months ago, he says. &quot;They are aware of our recycling machines. I don't know why we didn't hear from them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
