<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0646 </DOCNO><TEXT>We show that thermally stimulated luminescence is an important methodfor detecting insulating impurity phases that commonly occur in highT/sub c/ superconductors. The technique is sensitive to impurity phasesat andless;1% level with a probe depth of {similar_to} 1 {mu}m, which is theregion of interest for many superconductor applications. Samples of Y{sub2}O{sub 3}, Y{sub 2}BaCuO{sub 5}, YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub 6.2/, BaCO{sub3}, Ba{sub 3}CuO{sub 4}, BaCuO{sub 2}, and YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub x/(x{approx_equal}7) were investigated. All but the high quality sinteredpellets of YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub x/ exhibited relatively intense luminescence.The absence of luminescence, and thus of insulating phases, is correlatedwith low values of rf surface resistance.</TEXT></DOC>
