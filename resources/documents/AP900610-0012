(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke isclaiming credit for shifting debate to the right in the U.S. Senatecampaign here.   Duke often lashes out at the media for focusing on his past as aklansman and a neo-Nazi. But the publicity is helping him winpoints in conservative Louisiana as he works to unseat three-termDemocratic Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.   ``The overzealousness to attack me, what they've done is they'vemade people aware of my issues,'' said Duke, who is running as aRepublican without the blessing of the state party's leadership.   An April survey commissioned by Gannett News Service foundJohnston was supported by 44 percent of those questioned, Duke by21 percent and state Sen. Ben Bagert, the GOP's official candidate,8 percent. The survey, which had a 3.5 percentage point margin oferror, found 27 percent undecided.   Democrat Willie Singleton, a black state representative fromShreveport, is considering joining the race but has until July tomake up his mind.   Louisiana's Oct. 6 open primary is a candidate free-for-allwithout regard to party. If Johnson does not get 50 percent of thevote, he could be forced into a runoff with the second-placefinisher in November.   Johnston has urged Bagert to drop out of the Senate race toreduce the likelihood of a runoff between himself and Duke. ButBagert rejected that suggestion and told Johnson to ``stopwhining.''   Bagert maintains Duke can't win because of the tremendousnegative image created by his past ties to neo-Nazis such as RalphForbes, now a candidate for lieutenant governor in Arkansas.   As recently as a year ago, Duke was selling Nazi literature outof his legislative office _ clearing out his inventory, he said atthe time.   Duke now runs an organization called the National Organizationfor the Advancement of White People. He repeatedly says he hasbroken ties with the klan and the Nazis and is now focusing onequal rights for all.   Duke was elected to the state House last year by campaigningagainst taxes, against affirmative action, against minorityset-asides in government contracts and for welfare reform.   Now he hopes to unseat Johnston by portraying the senator as tooliberal for Louisiana tastes _ a tack also taken by Bagert.   Johnston accuses Bagert and Duke of running a``Johnny-One-Note'' campaign that harps on Johnston's role inhelping defeat former President Reagan's nomination of Robert Borkto the Supreme Court.   Johnston said Duke's right-wing rhetoric ``has not affected myissue orientation'' but that it ``certainly appears to haveaffected Mr. Bagert's.''   Johnston and Duke both point to a recent Bagert campaigncommercial in which Bagert pounds fist in hand and demands reformsthat would make the poor work for their welfare.   ``People all over the state are greeting me saying that everytime they see his commercial it makes them think of me,'' agrinning Duke said last week.   Bagert bristles at the notion that he's copying Duke or that heis a newcomer on the welfare reform bandwagon. He first introducedwelfare overhaul legislation as a House member in 1976, he said.   His latest proposals have been overshadowed by a brouhahastirred up when Duke gained House passage of a bill last month tooutlaw affirmative action programs that award jobs, promotions andscholarships on the basis of race.   The vote enraged the Legislative Black Caucus, and Gov. BuddyRoemer quickly promised to veto the bill if it got through theSenate.   Still, House passage brought more publicity to Duke and acomplaint from Bagert that the ex-klansman is getting freepublicity from the media.</TEXT></DOC>
