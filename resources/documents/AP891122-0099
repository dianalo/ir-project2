Daily Courier on East bloc reform and Cuba:   More than 40 years of pent-up frustration continues to spilldramatically from the (tear) in Eastern Europe's communistpolitical fabric. ...   The restless peoples of the East bloc have told theirgovernments they will no longer be put off in their desires forbasic personal freedoms and for political and economic reforms. ...   Manufacturing facilities ... rust in a sea of obsolescence.Collective farms ... have failed to feed the population that thefactories have failed to clothe. ...   All of which must be giving the shakes to ... Fidel Castro. ...All of the problems plaguing Eastern Europe plague Cuba as well,and Castro must know the day is coming when the Cuban people demandbasic travel, trade and political freedoms. ...   That day will be hastened when the Soviet Union _ now proppingup the anemic Cuban economy with massive financial aid and sugarprice subsidies _ weans Castro from his umbilical cord to Moscowand tells him it's time for Cuba to shift for itself in the realworld.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 20   The Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach, Fla., on Lech Walesa:   Poland wants money from the United States. Lech Walesa came toWashington last week with hat in hand, asking for a Marshall Planfor his country. Brother, can you spare $3 billion.   The sad truth is that the U.S. can't help ... Walesa now oranytime soon. The Marshall Plan that saved Western Europe in thelate 1940s and early '50s cost $13 billion. Multiply that three orfour times to imagine what it would cost today.   Then remember also that we are spending $165 billion each yearjust to pay off our $2.8 trillion national debt. ...   Other nations and our own citizens have always looked to theU.S. government for action on the big problems. If we can't fix thedebt problem, they will learn how America can just say no.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 17   Baraboo (Wis.) News-Republic on national coordination againstabductions:   The recent abduction of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling near hishometown of St. Joseph, Minn., once again casts an ugly light onthe fact that this country does not have a national clearinghousefor information regarding missing children.   While posters featuring the boy's picture and other relevantinformation have been distributed throughout the nation, theyinclude three different telephone numbers for people to call withinformation.   Mothers have been told by police that it is easier to trace astolen automobile than it is to trace a missing child.   That is a national disgrace.   With advanced technology in the field of communications, thereis no justifiable reason the nation does not have one central placewhere information regarding missing children can be processed.   That clearinghouse could be the repository for informationregarding known child abductors and sexual molesters, as well as afunnel for information regarding sightings of possible victims.   Such a service would not only aid authorities in their searchfor missing children but would also offer parents with missingchildren a chance to keep completely up to date on the search fortheir children.   While the plight of Jacob Wetterling has touched millions acrossthis nation, even if he is found safe and sound, the publicitysurrounding this case will all be for naught if Congress does notbegin to seriously consider a national missing children's center.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 19   Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune on education:   The issue is the poor performance of high school grads relativeto those in other nations.   Why do we compare so poorly?   Studies are showing that broad societal priorities are a factor.In the United States, teen-agers are distracted by other influencesthat diminish their interest in school. Parents and other adultsfoster this dissuasion.   Schooling today should be a deadly serious business, yet wetrivalize it. We do not respect and reward our system or ourteachers as much as citizens do in other lands where young peopleare becoming better educated.   We'd better wake up.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
