The investment bank, a unit of Salomon Inc., said that itsreview lasted nearly three months and examined nearly 1,000auction bids by Salomon for itself and its customers, tens ofthousands of trades and the conduct of its government tradingdesk in 68 Treasury auctions between Jan. 1, 1990, and Aug.8, 1991.</LP><TEXT>   Salomon had previously disclosed that the firm'sgovernment trading desk submitted unauthorized bids in thenames of customers in seven auctions. But the firm said thelatest suspected bidding violation wouldn't have causedSalomon to violate Treasury-auction rules that limit a singlebidder from buying more than 35% of an issue, even if Salomonsubmitted the bid in its own name.   While Salomon didn't elaborate on details of the latestsuspected violation, individuals familiar with the mattersaid that a questionable bid in the name of a customer wassubmitted by Salomon in the December 1990 auction of two-yearnotes. The firm's investigation found that Salomon's recordsshowed a $3 billion bid by the unnamed customer; thecustomer's records showed a $2 billion bid.   Although Salomon has ended its internal review of itsgovernment trading deskand briefed regulators and prosecutorson the conclusions -- questions still linger about theconduct of other trading desks that may have benefited fromthe bidding violations.   Paul Mozer, the former Salomon managing director whoheaded the firm's government trading desk, also headedSalomon's foreign exchange trading desk. In August, Salomonfired Mr. Mozer and blamed him for much of the wrongdoing towhich the firm has admitted. Last week, Securities andExchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden said his agencyis looking at whether there were links between the two desks.   Congressional officials and regulators have inquired aboutwhether the illegal activities of Salomon's governmenttrading desk may have also benefited or involved its bondarbitrage and finance desks. But Warren Buffett, Salomon'sinterim chairman, told lawmakers last month he didn't believeSalomon's bond arbitrage desk made trades based on the firm'sillegal Treasury auction activities.   And individuals familiar with Salomon's own investigationsaid yesterday that while they plan to further scrutinizeother desks, a preliminary investigation has turned up nowrongdoing outside of the government trading area.   Salomon said its investigation disclosed that the firmbegan submitting unauthorized bids in certain of itscustomers' names in July 1990, soon after the Treasury raisedquestions about the size of bids made by Salomon for its ownaccount. The firm said its investigation didn't disclose anyviolations in the first six months of 1990.   Salomon said the bids submitted by its government tradingdesk in early 1990 weren't in violation of any rules at thetime, &quot;but nonetheless were inappropriate.&quot; The firm said thelarge bids were apparently designed to assure that Salomonwould receive a greater share of Treasury securities atauction than it would otherwise have received.   In July 1990, largely in response to Salomon's excessivelylarge bids, the Treasury changed bidding rules, limiting themaximum bid by any one dealer at any one price to 35% of thesize of the auction.   The Treasury said the 35% limit was aimed at preventingbig dealers from &quot;squeezing&quot; out smaller rivals at governmentauctions. Mr. Mozer sharply criticized the rule at the timeit was instituted. Between July 1990 and May 1991, Mr.Mozer's desk violated the rule in several different auctions,Salomon says.   Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission, huntingfor more information on dealers of the debt ofgovernment-sponsored agencies, has sent out a new documentrequest to as many as 100 such dealers.   The five-page voluntary request doesn't carry the weightof a subpoena, but is a clear signal that the SEC isintrigued by what it has already learned about the dealers.As reported, SEC officials are considering legal actionagainst dozens of Wall Street securities firms forartificially inflating customer orders and falsifying booksand records in their bids for the debt of the FederalNational Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, andsimilar organizations.   The letter, sent in the past week by SEC enforcementdirector William McLucas, seeks information from the dealersdating back to the beginning of 1986. It requests documentson any &quot;false or inaccurate information concerning customers'indications of interest in purchasing the securities.&quot; Thedata request also targets collusive activity among thedealers or by dealers and customers.   Information is sought from dealers for Fannie Mae, theFederal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan MortgageAssociation, the Farm Credit Funding Corp. and the StudentLoan Marketing Association.   The SEC probe into the agency debt, which began in Augustwhen Salomon Brothers admitted that it inflated its orders,is controversial because it centers on a practice so acceptedin the industry that dealers were considered foolish if theydidn't inflate their orders. The practice represented aneffort by each dealer to assure that he received enoughsecurities when they eventually were allocated by theagencies.   ---   Kevin G.
