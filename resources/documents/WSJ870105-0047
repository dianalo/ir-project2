Spokesmen for the Canadian lumber industry and the opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties have accused the government of giving control over Canadian forest management to the U.S. and said the deal was too costly for the industry. The government concedes that an unspecified number of Canadian forest workers will lose jobs as a result of the export tax.    The controversial settlement could prove a further blow to the popularity of Mr. Mulroney's government, which is trailing the opposition Liberal Party in opinion polls. It also is expected to increase the pressure on talks between Canada and the U.S. aimed at removing trade barriers.    The settlement of the dispute over softwood lumber exports was reached late Tuesday, hours before the U.S. would have applied a countervailing duty on imports of Canadian softwood products, valued at $3 billion (U.S.) a year. Canada negotiated the settlement at the urging of the lumber-producing provinces, which will share the proceeds from the levy. If the U.S. had applied a countervailing duty, proceeds would have gone to the U.S. Treasury.    Industry officials and opposition parliamentarians argued that the U.S. will be able to dictate how Canada replaces the tax and how proceeds, estimated at more than $400 million a year, are used. Under the pact, the tax will eventually be replaced by higher fees charged by provinces to lumber companies for standing timber. U.S. government approval is needed for calculation of the value of measures Canada uses to replace the tax.    Adam H. Zimmerman, president of Noranda Inc., a Toronto-based mining and wood products company, and chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council, said the agreement was an &quot;immense intrusion&quot; on Canada's sovereignty. Herb Gray, a Liberal member of Parliament, said it &quot;was similar to something Poland would sign with the Soviet Union.&quot;    Canadian government officials said Canada's sovereignty over forestry resources won't be diminished by the pact.    But the Mulroney administration's attempt to sell the agreement to the Canadian public was hampered by the release of a letter sent to U.S. forest industry representatives by the Reagan administration.    The letter, signed on behalf of Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, said it was the U.S. government's &quot;understanding&quot; that it would have to approve any changes made by Canada to the export tax. It also listed uses of the tax proceeds that it said the U.S. might find unacceptable.    The pact may be canceled by either side with 30 days' notice. Under U.S. trade law, the president also may impose import penalties on softwood lumber if the U.S. government believes the pact has been broken. President Reagan imposed a 15% import levy on Canadian softwood imports until the export tax takes effect Thursday, because of U.S. concerns that Canadian lumber would flood the U.S. market during the tax-free week. </TEXT></DOC>
