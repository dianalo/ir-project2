The problem of &quot;flowback&quot; -- the return of shares in an international stock offering to their country of origin -- has been endemic in the developing international equity market. In British Telecommunications' $5 billion international offering two years ago, for instance, most of the $279 million allotted to the U.S. went straight back to London.    But the traffic in British Gas shares has been flowing the other way, even though the price immediately rose 30%. Overseas markets have been net buyers to the tune of tens of millions of shares, says Tony Alt, a director of London-based N.M. Rothschild Ltd., manager of the overall offering.    Eric S. Dobkin, equity syndicate head at Goldman Sachs, says his firm, which was lead manager of the U.S. portion of the offering and is a market-maker in the stock in London, has bought a significant number of shares in London, and notes that other firms have done the same. &quot;A number of blocks in the U.S. have been traded by major international firms that can arbitrage markets,&quot; he notes.    Arbitrage is the simple reason for the inflow into the U.S. Demand here for the stock has been strong enough to keep the U.S. price a few cents higher than the price in London.    Investors say the stock has a lot to recommend it to U.S. buyers. But the strength of the U.S. demand also springs from a carefully orchestrated campaign by the underwriters to make it a lot more attractive to hold than to sell.    For one thing, the underwriters didn't make the mistake that was made on British Telecom of pricing the stock too low. Telecom's shares doubled in price right after the offering, giving investors an almost irresistible temptation to sell. &quot;When the stock doubles, nobody is a holder,&quot; notes one syndicate official.    Goldman and its co-managers also limited both the size of the syndicate and the number of investors. &quot;We worked to get the accounts up to a critical size,&quot; says Victor A. Cohn, head of equity syndication at co-manager Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;If you just give them 10,000 shares, they're gone.&quot;    Goldman brought members of the syndicate to New York for a presentation on British Gas, just to make sure they understood the company. &quot;We told them they should place the shares primarily with their individual clients,&quot; says Mr. Dobkin.    At least one of the co-managers, Prudential-Bache Securities, did more than jawbone its brokers. The firm penalized those whose clients sold their shares in the secondary market; if the client sold above the offering price, the broker would lose the commission on the original sale, and if he sold at or below the offering price, the broker would lose the commission on the subsequent sale as well.    &quot;What we think it does is force the broker to put the shares into his best accounts,&quot; explains Theodore J. Coburn, Prudential-Bache syndicate head. The firm also bought stock in the secondary market to feed into its retail system, encouraging brokers to add to, rather than cut their clients' holdings and providing stock for clients who didn't get any originally.    Many retail firms penalize brokers who buy back stock before the settlement, Mr. Coburn says. Prudential-Bache took it a step further -- some penalties will remain in force until almost a month after the offering. Mr. Coburn believes the penalty system was one of the factors that won Prudential-Bache a co-manager slot on the offering. &quot;I think it's a unique commitment on the part of any broker,&quot; he says, adding that he believes the British government, seller of the shares, &quot;was impressed.&quot;    Other underwriters point out that nothing was stopping Prudential-Bache clients from selling their shares, once they got them, through other brokers. Nor did the system stop Prudential-Bache clients from selling somewhat under 50,000 American depositary receipts. An ADR represents a security that remains in a foreign country, usually in the custody of a bank there. But Mr. Coburn says the Prudential-Bache system saw a net inflow of about 500,000 ADRs in the secondary market.    The jawboning and disincentives cut down on pressure from brokers to &quot;take our profit and run,&quot; says John M. Birmingham, vice president for equity investments at Allstate Insurance. On British Telecom, he says, that pressure was intense.    The campaign against flowback was helped by British Gas's appeal to many long-term investors. &quot;You don't buy it for sizzly growth,&quot; says Lulu Wang, chief equity officer at Equitable Life Assurance Society, &quot;you buy it for a blue-chip, steady grower.&quot;    The efforts to boost demand in the U.S. were also aided by an offering structure that kept British demand to reasonable proportions, notes an official at Cazenove andamp; Co., lead broker to the British government. Whereas the government sold only half of British Telecom, it sold virtually all of British Gas.    That made a difference, the official says. The reason: both companies' shares are weighted in British stock indexes by their total common shares. That includes, in British Telecom's case, the stock held by the British government. As a result, demand from index funds for British Telecom shares was higher in relation to the supply than it was for British Gas. </TEXT></DOC>
