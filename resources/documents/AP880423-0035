It wasn't lightning or high wind that sent the players back tothe locker room. Just a case of flying hammers.   It seems some of the hammer throwers competing in the BostonCollege Relays adjacent to the softball diamond were a bit offtarget.   Before play began Thursday, base umpires told the coaches thatthey would keep an eye out for errant hammers, said MassachusettsCoach Elaine Sortino.   ``They told us to advise our outfielders that when they yelled`heads up,' the outfielders were to start running towards homeplate,'' she said Friday.   However, when three 16-pound weights plunked into the outfieldwithout a yip, and, between innings, a fourth ``landed right wherea fielder would be standing,'' Sortino said she decided ``myplayers aren't going out there.''   ``The officials tried to persuade us to play an inning and thenlet the hammer throwers take some throws and then play anotherinning, but there were skads of them, it was freezing cold, alreadylate, and it would have gone on forever,'' said Sortino, whoseprotest prompted the umpires to suspend the game.   Some 25 men and 25 women hammer throwers, with three throwseach, competed, said Reid Oslin, assistant athletic director atBoston College.   ``We never had anything like this happen before,'' Oslin said.``We host one major track meet a year and we will never againschedule a softball game at the same time.''</TEXT><DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Together, they've handled everything fromdomestic calls to burglaries to arsons to barking dogs. The onlydifference is that now Linda and Jimmy Bivens are handling it ashusband and wife.   The newlyweds, both Illinois state troopers, met in 1984 whenMrs. Bivens _ already a state cop _ visited the State PoliceAcademy in Springfield, where her future beau was just a cadet.   But the 28-year-old said of her husband, ``He didn't like me atfirst. He thought I was one of those women who was taking his job.''   That opinion didn't last long after Bivens, 30, finished histraining and they were put on the same detail.   ``Once we started working together, he realized I was all right.We got to be real good friends,'' Mrs. Bivens said.   ``She earned my respect,'' said Bivens. ``I've worked on Chicagoexpressway details, state fairs ... and she's one of the bestpolicemen I've ever worked with.   ``When you work with someone under trying circumstances, you seenot just their good side,'' he added. ``When you see them hot andsweaty, directing traffic, or handling a fatality, you get a truepicture of them.''   The couple, who married a month ago, trust each other to handleany situation that arises.   ``Naturally there's concern if you love someone. But really, shedoes a good job,'' Bivens said.   ``And I know he's a good policeman,'' Mrs. Bivens said.</TEXT></DOC>
