The railroad, a unit of Burlington Northern Inc., said thearbitration panel hearing the crew-size dispute with theUnited Transportation Union reported it had no jurisdictionto consider the merits of the dispute. A spokesman said thearbitration panel is expected to report its reasons fordropping the case by tomorrow. &quot;The arbitrators didn't tellus that much&quot; in their letter notifying of the lack ofjurisdiction, said the spokesman.</LP><TEXT>   But Thomas DuBose, president of the union, said thearbitrators' decision was technical and involved the lack offiling of proper notice by either the railroad or the unionfor work-rule changes under federal law. Such notice isrequired for arbitration, he said, adding that either therailroad or union could still file a notice.   The railroad has been seeking to reduce train-crew sizesfrom about four workers to either two or three for itsnorthern rail routes as a cost-saving measure. It already hasnegotiated reductions for the southern two-thirds of itsnational routes. The arbitration panel had held more than amonth of hearings, and had been scheduled to issue a finaldecision on crew size for the routes by Feb. 15.   Anthony Hatch, a rail analyst at PaineWebber Inc., saidthe decision last week seems to be just a &quot;delay of theinevitable -- but for how long, we don't know.&quot; He said theother major rail carriers already have achieved crewreductions, and that the arbitrators are likely to giveBurlington the reductions. &quot;I don't think that, given whatthe industry already has gotten from the unions, the UTU canhold onto current {Burlington} crew sizes. It's just a matterof time.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
