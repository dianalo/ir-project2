(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lands' End Inc. is performing adifficult juggling act this Christmas: Like most retailers, thecompany is trying to keep its sales buoyant despite the recession,but it's also gambling on new merchandise lines and a new marketingscheme aimed at expanding and reinvigorating its business.   The catalog giant, known for its turtleneck shirts, denim jeansand soft-sided luggage, ran in the red for the first three quartersof its current fiscal year following a disastrous Christmas 1989.The firm is resting its hopes for a rebound on a shift in itsstrategy.   After selling for years through a general catalog, one thatincluded all of its stock, Lands' End is putting out specialtycatalogs featuring particular lines, such as men's shirts and ties,children's wear or bed and bath products.   The company has also expanded its main catalog to add noveltygifts and pet products including a $75 pillow for dogs and a $10brass silent dog training whistle.   Analysts said the strategy is positive and appears to extend thefirm's reach into upper class markets already served by two bigLands' End competitors, Spiegel and L.L. Bean.   The new approach also delivers products more efficiently totraditional customers by creating special catalogs for consumerswith special needs, the analysts said.   ``This company is not changing from polka dots to stripes.They're seeking to raise their appeal level to core customers,''said Paul Shain, vice president of research for broker Robert W.Baird and Co. in Milwaukee.   Richard C. Anderson, Lands' End's president and chief executiveofficer, agreed with the analysts, predicting significant salesboosts from the specialty catalogs and their new products.   He said the company would update its styles with new colors andfabrics, but does not plan any radical fashion changes.   ``We are classic and simple and generally understated,''Anderson said. ``It's our belief that classic clothing will nevergo out of style.''   Lands' End, founded in 1963 in Chicago, initially suppliedsailboat hardware and equipment by mail. But in 1976, the companychanged its focus to leisure clothes.   While the company is enthusiastic about its new strategy, it istempered somewhat by the fact that it will difficult to increasesales while consumers are cutting back their spending in a weakeconomy.   ``They need to expand and they're moving in that direction. Butwhen the economy's lousy, people are cutting back on purchases,''said Marsha Raley, an analyst with Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis.   For the first nine months of this year, sales rose 9 percent to$374.6 million, but Lands' End recorded an operating loss of$259,000.   The company has blamed its troubles in part on the consumerspending slowdown that has afflicted most retailers.   ``We saw some fairly early signs of the recession,'' saidAnderson. ``We experienced some softness in sales. It was somethingwe couldn't do a heck of a lot about.''   Lands' End also lost money because of the costs of selling offlarge inventories after a disappointing Christmas 1989.   A year ago, the company overestimated its sales and ended upsaddled with $85.7 million in inventory, up 28 percent from theyear before. Lands' End was forced to liquidate much of theoverstock at bargain prices and at the expense of its profits.   The company declined to comment on how it is doing so far in thecurrent quarter.   With the new strategy, the company's success will dependsomewhat on its ability to forecast sales with greater accuracy andavoid being caught with too large an inventory, said Liz Armstrong,an analyst with Johnson Redbook in New York.   The company's slump this year has been a disappointment for the3,200 residents in Dodgeville, the rural community nestled insouthwestern Wisconsin where Lands' End located its sprawlingfacilities in 1979.   ``There won't be any profit sharing this year; there aren't anyprofits to share,'' said Hank Van Epps, an electrician and one ofhundreds of Dodgeville residents who work for Lands' End.   Company officials said it's too early to estimate profits forthe current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 31, since the fourthquarter's holiday sales will determine how well Lands' End fares.</TEXT></DOC>
