The House passed the bill withenough votes to ensure the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. TheSenate vote was two votes shy of the needed margin.;   Bush backs Dolemeasure;   Bush used his veto message to press for congressional passage of analternative offered by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan. &quot;I wouldgladly sign into law responsible legislation that does not threaten theeconomic recovery and its associated job creation,&quot; he said.;   Bush contendedthe Democrats' bill &quot;violates essential elements&quot; of the budget accord thatCongress and the White House agreed to last year because it did not provideoffsetting budget savings to pay for the measure.;   Dole's bill would provideup to 10 weeks of additional benefits for workers who had exhausted theirbasic six months of jobless pay. The money would come from auctioning offunused radio-telephone frequencies and by extending a program to recoup unpaidfederal college loans.;   Democrats contend those financing methods would notprovide enough money to pay for even the less expensive Dole measure. Theyportrayed Bush as caring more for the rich than for working people leftjobless by the recession.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ELLEN WARREN AND DAVID HESS, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911012  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  421  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, October 12, 199100286142,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
