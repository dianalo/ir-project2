President Bush intends to enact the historic legislation in aWhite House ceremony on Wednesday, said administration andcongressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. TheTreasury Department said it will borrow the first $5 billioninstallment of the bailout on Thursday.   The legislation, passed by Congress on Saturday, authorizes $50billion in borrowing over the next 26 months to close or merge 500insolvent Sandamp;Ls. Of that, $20 billion must be borrowed in the nexteight weeks, before the end of the 1989 fiscal year.   Treasury officials said $15 billion of this year's borrowingwill be used to replace high-rate certificates of deposit at someof the 262 failed thrifts already under government control. Thegoal is to reduce operating losses until regulators can rescue thethrifts permanently.   ``The effect ... may be quite significant,'' said RichardBreeden, Bush's chief adviser on savings and loans. ``You're takingsome of the institutions that have been rate leaders out of themarketplace. That will reduce pressure on all other institutions,both banks and thrifts, that have had to pay a premium to competeagainst these unhealthy firms.''   The remaining $5 billion raised this year will be used to eithershut down or attract new owners to the thrifts in the worstfinancial trouble. The first of these deals could be announced assoon as this week.   ``I think the process will begin very quickly,'' said spokesmanAlan Whitney of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which isgetting the job of managing the bailout.   However, he said the frequency of rescues will be ``moremeasured'' than the frantic pace struck at the end of last year,when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board committed $16 billion in atwo-day spending spree to rescue 75 institutions.   The legislation, in addition to funding the bailout, imposestough new financial standards on savings and loans and triggers themost sweeping overall changes in the regulatory bureaucracy in 50years.   Among many changes, the Resolution Trust Corp., a new agencyheaded by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, will be created tooversee the FDIC's management of the bailout.   Whitney said an organizational meeting of the RTC board isplanned on the same day as the White House signing ceremony andthat the board will appoint an executive director. Officials saidthe board likely will choose someone already within the governmentas a temporary director until a permanent appointment is made.   The administration originally planned to borrow only $10 billionin fiscal year 1989, which ends Sept. 30. However, as part of adeal struck with Congress just before final passage of thelegislation, it agreed to raise $20 billion this year.   That will balloon the 1989 deficit to near $170 billion, thehighest in three years.   The government will raise another $30 billion for rescues in1990 and 1991, but as part of the compromise the administrationwill borrow that money through a new, quasi-private agency and thespending will not be counted in the deficit.   The Treasury Department said it will borrow the first $5 billionon Thursday by auctioning 247-day cash management bills, which thegovernment must be repay on April 19.   In a related development, the FDIC said it is taking over nineinsolvent Sandamp;Ls in Louisiana, bring the total under governmentcontrol to 262 in 33 states.   Meanwhile, one of the first institutions taken over byregulators this year, Cartersville Federal Savings Bank of Georgia,was sold to the Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Prudential isinvesting $20 million for $56.9 million in assets. No governmentassistance is involved.</TEXT></DOC>
