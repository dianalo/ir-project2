in personalcomputers, and the Internet Worm.andP;  A few perpetrators have received jailsentences.andP;  Background on some of the problems is found in a forthcoming ACMPress book edited by Peter Denning [1].andM;DiscussionandM;The increased prevalence of breakins and viruses may be considered a symptomof problems to come.andP;  Computer systems and networks often do not enforcesufficient security, and in many cases are intrinsically vulnerable.andP;  Thexisting laws are not adequately precise.andP;  (What are 'access' and 'authorizedaccess'?andM;Note that the Internet Worm's exploitation of sendmail, finger, and rhostsrequired no authorization!)andP;  Ethical teachings are desirable but may not havemuch effect on determined misusers, especially in a society in which fraudand creative malpractices are commonplace--and even considered by some assuccesses.andM;Easy access is not a virtue in systems in which critical functionality (e.g.,andO;life-preserving) can be compromised.andP;  Security technology has been advancingin recent years.andP;  However, attack techniques have escalated accordingly.andO;Preencryptive dictionary attacks on password files described in 1979 byMorris and Thompson [3] are actually being used, for example, in recentpenetrations of U.S.andP;  computers from Australia.andP;  Other password weaknessesare also being exploited.andP;  Electronic capture of vital information isbecoming easier.andM;ConclusionsandM;The security provided by many computer systems is fundamentally flawed.andP;  Inother cases, valid security techniques exist but are not being used properly.andO;Better hardware and software systems are necessary to hinder insider misuseas well as penetrators.andP;  People are the ultimate problem.andP;  Despite improvingtechnology, serious risks remain.andM;Although cases of security penetration and misuse by authorized userscontinue, many such cases remain unreported while further vulnerabilitieslurk--waiting to be abused.andP;  Some of the deeper implications of the overallsecurity problem remain obscured from general view.andM;ReactionsandM;With regard to the Internet Worm, seldom has the computer community been sodivided by one incident.andP;  In the final analysis, there seem to be fairlywidespread moderate sentiments that the Worm was a badly conceived experimentand should never have been attempted, but that Robert Tappan Morris'ssentence was essentially fair--neither meting out excessive punishment norfailing to provide a deterrent to would-be emulators.andP;  But many diversepositions have also been expressed.andP;  On one side are thoughts that RTM shouldhave received an extensive jail term, or perhaps should have been barrd fromthe computer profession for life, or that companies willing to employ himshould be boycotted.andP;  On the other side are thoughts that RTM became asacrificial lamb to  his country in demonstrating a diverse collection offlaws that have long cried out for greater recognition; or that he was anaccidental whistle-blower whose most serious mistake was a programming errortha enabled the Worm to replicate out of control within each penetratedsystem, contrary to what he had intended; or that the ARPANET was a sandboxanyway.andP;  Doug McIlroy [2] expressed concerns that many of the potentiallessons may have gone unnoted.andM;&quot;Those who repudiate only the final misdeed implicitly absolve the priorlapses in ethics and oversight that made the worm fiasco possible.andP;  Theysignal that you can get away with building, promoting, distributing, andselling decietful software as long as you are not caught exploiting it.&quot;andP;  Thedebate is likely to continue, just as risks are likely to persist.andM;&quot;Inside Risks&quot;
