Theresults of the review should only be considered as having identifiedtrends or indications. The Team's observations and recommendations forthe most part are based upon standards used for licensed reactor facilitypractices. These standards form the basis for many of the comments inthis report. The Team believes that a uniform minimum standard of performanceshould be achieved in the operation of DOE reactors. In order to assurethat this is accomplished, clear standards are necessary. Consistentwith the past AEC and ERDA policy, the Team has used the standards ofthe commercial nuclear power industry. It is recognized that this approachis conservative, in that the ATR reactor has a significantly greaterdegree of inherent safety (lower pressure, temperature, power, etc.)than a licensed reactor. Although the Review Team found no indicationsor evidence that the plant is being operated in an unsafe manner, variousareas were identified where improvements are either needed or shouldbe considered to increase the safety of reactor operations.</TEXT></DOC>
