The agricultural biotechnology company, which already hassome products marketed, said it has received a patent on thelow-seed sweet pepper. It will be marketed under the name&quot;sweet mini peppers&quot; in the VegiSnax line of its Freshworldventure, which currently offers carrot and celery sticks withimproved shelf life. Freshworld is a joint venture of DNAPlant and Du Pont Corp. The peppers have nearly twice therecommended daily allowance of vitamin C, DNA Plant said.</LP><TEXT>   DNA Plant's scientists, which have field-tested the newpepper variety for the past two years, developed it through aprocess known as gametoclonal variation. Scientists began byculturing reproductive cells of a bell pepper plant in agrowth medium. After the cells were regenerated into plants,these progeny were tested for natural genetic variation.Those plants with desirable characteristics were thenintroduced into a breeding program from which the optimalpepper variety was selected.</TEXT></DOC>
