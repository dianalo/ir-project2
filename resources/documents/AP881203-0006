But the memory of Watergate, which drove Nixon to resign underthreat of impeachment in 1974, hung heavy over the festivities bythe green-and-white cottage where he was born in 1913.   ``Only history can be the judge'' of Nixon's performance, hisdaughter said, adding that she hoped the library ``will help teardown some of the stereotypes'' regarding her father's administration.   ``History will treat him far more kindly than his own time,''added Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.   Nixon's other daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, was to have spoken, butstayed home with the flu, said Kevin Cartwright, spokesman for theRichard M. Nixon Presidential Archives Foundation. Nixon, who livesin Saddle River, N.J., stayed away to yield center stage to hisdaughters, Cartwright said.   The Richard M.

Utley lambasted shows hosted by Morton Downey Jr. and GeraldoRivera. Rivera recently had his nose broken when a fight broke outduring filming of a show on white supremacists.   ``The very presence of these shows on our TV screen gives theprograms, subjects and their behavior a certain legitimacy that thisis proper behavior. It is not,'' Utley said.</TEXT></DOC>
