Brian GregoryCaldwell, 22, of Palo Alto faces 14 counts of burglary. Lester Leon Fong, 22,of San Jose faces 10 counts of burglary.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But a month ago police seized their &quot;inventory,&quot; and on Friday warrantswere issued for the arrest of the three men who investigators say ran anextensive computer theft ring.;    Roaming the offices and laboratories at SanJose State University, they stole more than $100,000 worth of computerequipment in the past 18 months, university police said at a news conferenceFriday.;    Arrest warrants were issued for Brian Gregory Caldwell, 22, now ofPalo Alto; and Lester Leon Fong, 22, and Wallace Check Lee, 24, both of SanJose.;    All three were to surrender to be booked into county jail in lieu of$200,000 bail each. Caldwell's attorney, James Blackman, said the surrenderwould probably take place next week.;    The three suspects have beencooperating with police since officers with search warrants found stolencomputer equipment at their homes last month, investigators said.;   Caldwell, a senior art major at San Jose State, faces 14 counts of burglary.Fong, who graduated last fall with a bachelor of science degree in industrialtechnology, faces 10 counts of burglary. Lee, charged with five counts ofburglary, is a former San Jose State student.;    The three are still underinvestigation by other law enforcement agencies. Additional charges may yet befiled by police at San Jose State, Stanford University and Palo Alto,investigators said.;    Over the past 18 months, the three were responsiblefor about 60 percent of all the burglaries committed on the San Jose Statecampus, university police Sgt. Bruce Lowe said at the news conference.;   Lowe and other officers showed off a mother lode of computer systems,software, printers, keyboards, disk drives, television and stereo equipment,VCR systems and components, firearms and $2,000 in cash seized from homes inSan Jose and Palo Alto last month.;    So far, officers have recovered about$70,000 worth of missing equipment or items purchased with money obtained byselling stolen gear, Lowe said.;    Lowe said the trio did not have anyspecial access to the campus.;    &quot;They spent hours daily scouting buildingson campus to find out where various items were kept, what sort of securitysystems were in place, what sort of alarms they might have to encounter andthe locking devices they would have to overcome to get the items,&quot; Lowe said.;   Often the theft was as simple as walking into an empty office, putting acomputer into a bag and walking away, investigator Bryan Garrett said. And thesuspects had a portable radio scanner tuned to university police frequenciesas the thefts occurred, Garrett said.;    When the first wave of theftsresulted in the university increasing security and locking down somecomputers, the thieves began stealing the internal mechanisms and leaving thecases behind, Lowe said.;    The break in the case came July 19 when Palo Altopolice received a tip from an informant saying Caldwell was responsible for aburglary at a preschool and was involved in the San Jose State thefts.;   Lowe said Caldwell implicated the others after police found stolen computersat his home in Palo Alto.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FRANK SWEENEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910810  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  622  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, August 10, 199100223047,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
