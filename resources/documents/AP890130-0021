Skittish calves pressed closer to their mothers on the 170-acrefarm in the ancient town of Tongeren, 55 miles east of Brussels.   Fagard's special breed of cattle are raised free of the growthhormones widely used in the United States but banned in Europe.   When European nations refused to accept hormone-treated meat, theUnited States retaliated with stiff duties on some European imports.   ``People want hormone-free food. ... Thanks to this breed we cancompete without giving hormones,'' said Fagard, whose family hasbeen farming in Tongeren for more than 200 years.   On Jan. 1, the European Economic Community banned imports of beeffrom cattle treated with growth hormones.   The 12-nation trading bloc earlier had blocked their use inEurope because of consumer worries that the additives pose a healthrisk. Hormones, natural and synthetic, are injected into animals'ears to boost growth rates.   In flouting the ban, the United States has argued that hormonesused by its farmers are safe. The EEC has warned it will imposetough tariffs on American walnuts and dried fruit if no progress ismade by Feb. 20 to end the dispute.   ``There is a trade war hanging (over us),'' said OdielZwaenepoel, economic adviser to the Belgian Boerenbond, the farmunion.   Joseph Yverneau, president of the Committee of Professional FarmOrganizations, the umbrella group for farm unions in the CommonMarket, said: ``We don't want a war with the United States. But weare forced to respond.''   Without the ban, European farmers would be at a competitivedisadvantage, Fagard said. The farmers also said, however, the banmay be too stringent.   ``We found the regulation is too severe,'' said Yverneau, whofarms in northern France. ``There are certain natural hormones ...which could be authorized.''   Fagard said the 50 or so calves on his farm, if raised with extrahormones, would weigh about 200 pounds more at the time of slaughter.   Hugo Schrevens, who operates a dairy farm northwest of Fagard'sfarm, said: ``Everyone knows you have a better financial result whenyou use hormones.''   But, Fagard said, ``The pressure is such that governments andpoliticians cannot yield to the small group of producers who mightwant to use hormones.''   There have been recent cases in Europe in which farmers allegedlybought hormones on the black market to fatten their cattle. Thefarmers interviewed doubted the practice was widespread because ofstiff penalties for violators.   The hormone ban is expected to block $100 million worth of U.S.beef imports, a small part of the $166 billion trade estimatedbetween the European Economic Community and the United States lastyear.   ``It is a mini-problem actually,'' said Friedrich Rode, a Germanfarmer and vice president of the European farm organization.   In fact, the hormone dispute is overshadowed by a larger fightbetween the United States and Europe over farm subsidies.   The United States wants the Common Market to end import barriersand export and domestic subsidies that it says distort trade.   It initially demanded the subsidies be eliminated by the year2000 but has since said the date is negotiable.</TEXT></DOC>
