The nation's largest steelmaker and owner of Marathon OilCo. earned $267 million, or $1.03 a share, compared with $244million, or 91 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Salesincreased 28% to $6.23 billion from $4.88 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Fourth-quarter operating earnings at the company's energysegment more than doubled to $338 million, reflecting a jumpin crude oil prices. Steel operating earnings fell 31% to $52million, as prices slumped.   In spite of lower steel-related earnings, USX's USS steelunit was the most profitable major steelmaker and may be theonly one to report a profit in the recession-wracked fourthquarter. Armco Inc., Inland Steel Industries Inc., BethlehemSteel Corp. and LTV Steel Co., a unit of LTV Corp., havereported or are expected to report losses for the quarter.   While those losses largely relate to specific problems,such as equipment breakdowns and restructuring, USX seems tohave outperformed steel industry competitors on an operatingbasis as well in the quarter. Analysts said USX had lowerlabor costs and a more profitable product mix, includingtubular pipe for the oil industry -- one of the few steelproducts in strong demand.   Moreover, unlike its competitors, which have curtailedproduction and thus incurred higher operating costs, USXcontinued to run plants at relatively high levels andactually boosted shipments. The reason: USX was accumulatinga stockpile in case of a strike. The company and the UnitedSteelworkers union are trying to negotiate a labor contractto replace the one set to expire Friday. &quot;The high operatingrate, plus some pickup in tubular goods and good costcontrols should cause the company to have the best operatingperformance of major steelmakers,&quot; said Peter Marcus ofPaineWebber Inc.   But while volume was better than most analysts expected,steel profits were lower. Charles Bradford, with UBSSecurities, said the company earned about $18 per ton ofsteel shipped compared with his estimate of $25 a ton. Heblamed weak prices. Fourth-quarter prices fell about $17 aton from last year's level and $4 a ton from the thirdquarter.   Meanwhile, USX's energy segment has been riding high sinceIraq's invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices surging. Operatingearnings at the so-called upstream operation, includingexploration and development, skyrocketed to $260 million from$61 million in the fourth quarter. The downstream business,which includes refining, marketing and transportation, alsomanaged a slight increase in operating earnings despite thoseoperations having to pay higher prices for crude oil. Thoseoperations earned $69 million in the fourth quarter, up from$58 million a year ago.   For the year, USX earnings fell 15% to $818 million, or$3.14 a share, from $965 million, or $3.53 a share. Salesgrew 11% to $20.66 billion from $18.72 billion. The companyattributed the 1990 earnings decline to reduced gains fromasset sales.   USX shares closed yesterday at $28.125, off 37.5 cents, inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading.</TEXT></DOC>
