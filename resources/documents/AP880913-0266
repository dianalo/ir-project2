(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Apple Computer Inc. ChairmanSteven P. Jobs has achieved a coup by reportedly enlistingInternational Business Machines Corp. to back Next Inc.'slong-awaited new computer, analysts say.   Next has closely guarded the details of the computer, which hasbeen three years in the making and is scheduled to be unveiled Oct.12 after repeated delays.   The New York Times reported Tuesday that IBM is paying $10million for the right to use the symbols and commands with whichthe user will interact with Jobs' new computer.   Industry executives said IBM plans to use the Jobs technology _which controls the ``look and feel'' of the machines _ on computersthat run the Unix operating system.   Jobs has said the Next computer was initially designed forcollege students and academic researchers, although analysts saidthey now believe he envisions a wider market for the computer.   Analysts noted that Jobs faces a much tougher environment forstartups than when he founded Apple in nearby Cupertino more than11 years ago. IBM and Apple have set high computer standards, andthose two companies and Sun Microsystems Inc. have successfullywooed the specialized academic market for years..   ``He's got to have something that really sets it apart,something that lights a fire,'' William Lampesis of Dataquest Inc.in San Jose said Monday.   For years, IBM was the major rival of Jobs in efforts todominate of the personal computer industry while Jobs headed Apple.   When he lost a bitter battle three years ago with Applepresident John Sculley and was ousted from the company, Jobs setout to invent a new personal computer as significant as the AppleMacintosh.   The yet-unnamed Next computer is expected to have a number offeatures not available on current personal computers, such as ahigh-speed facsimile modem, powerful digital sound processingcapabilities, an erasable compact disc player for data storage andretrieval and the ability to display television-quality videosignals.   Jobs may face legal obstacles in his effort to establish his newmachine on the market. Apple sued Jobs in 1985 and, as part of asettlement, won the right to inspect the Next machine for possibletrade secret violations. Apple says Jobs has given only ``partialcompliance.''   ``We still reserve the right for further evaluation of theproduct,'' said Apple spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur.   Cathy Cook, Next's spokeswoman, expressed surprise at Apple'sclaim, saying she believed Apple had ``signed off on the machine.''   ``As far as Next is concerned, they've fulfilled everything theyhave to do,'' Cook said.   But Jobs' strong credibility in the industry and the IBMconnection make experts reluctant to say he can't clear the hurdlesahead of him.   ``Steve is Steve. Whatever he does is of great interest topeople,'' said Katie Povejsil, academic solutions manager at Apple.   At universities, she said, ``I get the impression there is areal wait-and-see attitude. They've been promised a lot, and they'dlike to see the goods.''</TEXT></DOC>
