In a letter to Cincinnati-based Kroger, Kohlberg said, ``We findit difficult to understand that the board acted on matters of suchimportance to stockholders without the benefit of meeting with us... We can only conclude that the board has decided the company isnot for sale at any price. ''   Kohlberg said it did not anticipate making any further proposals.   A week ago, New York-based Kohlberg sweetened its bid for thenation's second-largest supermarket operator to $64 a share in cashand securities. The bid was competing against a $55-a-share offerfrom Maryland's Haft family, which began the contest last month.   Although analysts said Kroger managers might be pressured toaccept Kohlberg's latest offer, the grocer last week began layingoff employees as part of a restructuring plan designed to fend offthe two unwanted suitors.   Some 300 positions were eliminated at Kroger headquarters, andthe company also has announced plans to sell off certain assets.   As part of its restructuring, Kroger plans to distribute aspecial dividend of $40 in cash plus notes and stock for eachKroger share. In its letter to the board, Kohlberg said thefinancial community had valued the Kroger restructuring at $53 to$56 a share.   On Wall Street, trading in Kroger shares was halted temporarily.The last sale of Kroger stock was at $57.50 a share on the New YorkStock Exchange, down 12{ cents from Monday.   The buyout firm hinted it might have been willing to improve itsoffer if it had an opportunity to meet with the board.   ``We are perplexed that the board found our proposal to beinadequate,'' the letter said, adding that Kohlberg was not evenasked ``if we were in a position to improve'' the bid.   The Haft family, which controls Dart Group Corp. and has areputation as corporate raiders, last week offered to help Krogerfight the Kohlberg bid by proposing to provide additional equityfor Kroger's restructuring.   The 105-year-old Kroger has 170,000 employees and 52,000shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarketsand convenience stores.</TEXT></DOC>
