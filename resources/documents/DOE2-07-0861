<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-07-0861 </DOCNO><TEXT>A detailed model of in-cylinder heat transfer in spark ignited engineshas been developed. The model is based on a well established boundarylayer representation which is driven by a flow model which describesall of the major in-cylinder fluid motions: swirl, squish, piston motionand turbulence. The flow model allows for bowl-in-piston and recessedhead geometries, divided into four flow regions. The convective heattransfer coefficients are calculated from Colburn analogy using the localeffective flow velocities. The coefficients thus vary from surface tosurface within the combustion chamber, reflecting the effects of localflow conditions. During the combustion, the model simulates flame propagationas a spherically growing region originating at the spark location. Theinstantaneous flame position calculated by this model feeds directlyinto the heat transfer model, which resolves the combustion chamber surfacesin a detailed manner. The model was applied to a well documented experimentaldata set obtained by other investigators. These data include measurementsof heat fluxes at different engine speeds, spatial locations, intakepressures (volumetric efficiency), and spark timing. The results of thesecomparisons showed a good agreement across the whole data set.</TEXT></DOC>
