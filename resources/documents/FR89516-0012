This ruleis issued in accordance with OMB regulations for controlling paperworkburdens on the public and serves as notice that the cited collections ofinformation are approved. This document also correctly displays our longstandingformula for computing the State share of the Federal Medical AssistancePercentage (FMAP). Section 433.10(b) of our regulations contains a typographicalerror.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Effective Date:</T2> These regulations are effective May 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For further information contact:</T2> Maxine Turnipseed, (301) 966-1981.(For information collection requirements.)Matt Plonski, (301) 966-4662. (For FMAP correction.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Supplementary information:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>Information Collection RequirementsUnder the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.Chapter 35), Federal agencies are required to obtain Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) approval of ``collection of information'' requirementsthat are contained in any regulations published by the agencies. To implementprovisions of this act, OMB has established regulations under Part 1320of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The OMB regulationsrequire Federal agencies (1) to notify the public that a collection ofinformation requirement has been approved by OMB by issuing a notice inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and (2) to display the control number assignedby OMB after approval of the requirement, as part of the agency's regulatorytext.To comply with the OMB requirement that HCFA include in its regulationsthe OMB control numbers assigned, we have established a general regulationunder 42 CFR 400.310 to display valid OMB control numbers and applicableregulation sections as a means of notifying the public that the informationcollection requirements have been approved. We update this regulation routinelyto add the most recent OMB control numbers or to delete entries no longerin effect.Federal Medical Assistance PercentageThe Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social SecurityAct (the Act), is a State administrated program that provides medical assistanceto certain needy individuals. Funding is shared between the States andthe Federal Government. Under the Medicaid program, the term ``medicalassistance'' means payment of part or all of the cost of care and servicesprovided to a beneficiary under a HCFA approved State plan. The portionof the medical assistance expenditures that the Federal Government providesto the States to cover their expenditures is called the Federal MedicalAssistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP cannot be less than 50 percent normore than 83 percent for any State. Each State's percentage is determinedby the formula described in section 1905(b) of the Act and shown in ourregulations at 42 CFR 433.10(b). Under that formula the State whose percapita income exceeds that of the national per capita income would receivea lower share from the Federal Government. Also, the State whose per capitaincome is lower than the national average would receive a higher sharefrom the Federal Government. The Federal Government share would be withinthe statutory 50-83 percentage limits.Although section 1905(b) of the Act clearly indicates the formula and ratiorelationships to be used to calculate FMAP, the formula in our regulationsat andSection; 433.10(b) is incorrectly presented.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of These Regulations</ITAG>Information Collection RequirementsBefore May 2, 1983 there was no requirement to publish OMB control numbersin agency regulations. Under 5 CFR 1320.2, we submit for OMB approval informationcollection requirements that we identify in existing regulations eitherbecause they have not been previously approved or because a prior approvalhas expired. After the approval is obtained, we publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> the control numbers for the sections approvedor reapproved. In this manner, we expect to eventually publish controlnumbers for all our regulation sections that have OMB approved informationcollection requirements, and also to update reapproved items. We have identifieda number of items for inclusion in our table at andSection; 400.310 basedon an OMB approval action. (Ordinarily a reapproval item retains its originalcontrol number and will not be reprinted in andSection; 400.310. This isnot always the case and some of our information collections have been assignedmore than one control number.)In the preamble of final rules containing information collection requirements,we identify sections of the regulations for which we have requested assignmentof an OMB control number. Control numbers have been assigned for the followingdocuments published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>:Peer Review Organization Contracts Solicitation of Statements of InterestFrom In-State Organizations (53 FR 7976, March 11, 1988) (42 CFR 462.102and 462.103).Conditions for Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (53FR 20448, June 3, 1988) (42 CFR 483.410, 483.420, 483.440, 483.450, 483.460,483.470).<ITAG tagnum="81">Technical Correction</ITAG>We are revising andSection; 433.10(b), Rates of FFP for program services,to correct typographical errors by amending the State share formula soit conforms to the formula described in section 1905(b) of the Act. Weinadvertently omitted the division sign ``/'' and failed to include thebrackets that are used to indicate the computation within the formula.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date</ITAG>This regulation and technical correction merely update our display of OMBcontrol numbers for approved collection of information requirements containedin HCFA regulations and correct an obvious typographical error in existingregulation text. The Department routinely publishes a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when an information collection requirements clearancerequest identified in a rule or notice is submitted to OMB, and the publicis offered an opportunity to comment. With respect to the typographicalerror, this rule repeats the formula contained in statute, without interpretation.To publish either in proposed form is unnecessary and serves no usefulpurpose. Therefore, we find good cause to waive notice of proposed rulemaking.We are publishing this final rule without the usual 30-day delay in effectivedate. We consider the updating of the chart found at andSection; 400.310to be technical in nature. As noted above, the public is informed of therequirements and advised that formal notice will be made of the approval.Since the rule is technical in nature, we believe it is unnecessary andwould serve no useful purpose to delay the effective date beyond the dateof publication. Therefore, we find good cause to waive a delay in effectivedate.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Impact Analysis</ITAG>As noted above, this regulation is technical in nature and merely updatesthe display of OMB control numbers of approved collection of informationrequirements contained in HCFA regulations and corrects a typographicalerror. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that this document doesnot meet criteria for a major rule as defined in section 1(b) of ExecutiveOrder 12291. The Secretary also certifies, consistent with the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, that this document would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, we are notpreparing a rural impact as required by section 1102(b) of the Act sincewe have determined, and the Secretary certifies that this rule will nothave a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial numberof small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
