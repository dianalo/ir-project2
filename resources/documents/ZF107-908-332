And frame-ups -- a computer saboteur canmake it look as though someone else performed the sabotage.&quot;andM;Employees responsible for accidental system crashes could also be unjustlysnared by detection programs, said Ann Branscomb, a Cambridge, Mass., lawyerand researcher at Harvard University's program on information resourcespolicy.andP;  As computer networks proliferate, Branscomb said, more cases willoccur and safeguards are needed.andM;&quot;I want everyone who uses a computer to know about this,&quot; said Williams lastweek.andP;  &quot;It's a bad dream.&quot;andM;The computer detection program used as evidence against Marshall Williamswasn't foolproof, according to the man who wrote the program.andM;Written to the hard disk of the Altos Computer Systems model 986, the programwas designed to tell which terminal had issued a command to remove files,said Tim Plotner, a programming consultant for Computer Connection Inc., aClarkesville, Ga., computer store.andM;Plotner said the possibility of someone tampering with the program to frameWilliams was farfetched because none of Williams' co-workers knew about it.andO;But, Plotner added, tampering would have been possible if someone knew theprogram was installed and was familiar with the operating system.andM;Someone seeking to falsify the program would have needed to enter a user ID,the time, the terminal number, which users were on the system and the removecommand, Plotner said.andM;Plotner emphasized the program only identified the defendant's terminal, notthe defendant himself.andP;  &quot;We have been very careful here.andP;  We are not accusingMarshall Williams of doing something.&quot;andM;Plotner cautioned that in larger computer networks that involve moresophisticated users, such tampering-detection programs would have to bedesigned very carefully.andM;-- R.M.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
