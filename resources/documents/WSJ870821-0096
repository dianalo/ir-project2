The walkouts, which began Tuesday at government-owned Canadian National Railways, spread to CP Rail, a division of Canadian Pacific Ltd., a Montreal-based transportation and industrial concern.    A CP Rail spokesman said that work was disrupted for several hours yesterday morning at a Montreal rail yard, but that employees returned to work after union officials intervened. A small group of CP Rail employees later left their jobs at a Toronto yard, the spokesman said. The Associated Rail Unions, which negotiates on behalf of nine unions, hasn't authorized the walkouts.    At Canadian National, a spokesman said that about 500 employees were off the job at three sites around Toronto; in Montreal, most of the 1,100 workers who walked out Tuesday at a company repair shop returned to work, leaving about 300 to 400 employees off the job.    Both railroads said that the walkouts resulted in delays, but that rail operations continued.    The unions became legally entitled to strike Tuesday under Canadian labor law. The unions and the railroads are discussing a new offer made by the railroads Wednesday. Among the issues in the dispute are wages, subcontracting and work rules. </TEXT></DOC>
