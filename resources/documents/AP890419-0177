The rightist president-electblamed leftist guerrillas.   Roberto Garcia Alvarado, 53, was killed instantly by the blast,said Oscar Orellana, the driver. The explosion ripped a holethrough the roof of the attorney general's Jeep Cherokee.   Garcia is the highest-ranking government official slain sincethe civil war began in 1981. An estimated 70,000 Salvadorans, mostof them civilians, have been killed in the conflict.   Neither the driver nor a bodyguard in the jeep was visiblywounded, but both complained of partial deafness from the blast.   No group immediately claimed responsibility. President-electAlfredo Cristiani blamed leftist guerrillas battling theU.S.-backed government.   In Washington, the State Department called the assassination a``brutal, despicable killing'' and said the act was designed toprovoke further violence. ``We condemn this terrorism,'' said StateDepartment spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front last monthaccused the attorney general's office of ``covering up formurderers.'' Garcia was a militant of Cristiani's rightistRepublican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.   El Salvador's attorney general, the government's chiefprosecutor, is not a Cabinet official and is appointed by Congress,which is controlled by Arena. Garcia had held the post sinceDecember.   Orellana told journalists the jeep stopped at a downtown SanSalvador traffic light at 7:45 a.m. when a young man placedsomething on the roof. The driver said he immediately tried toaccelerate, but the bomb exploded.   Cristiani, who was having breakfast with foreign correspondentswhen the attack occurred, condemned what he termed ``the brutalassassination by Marxist guerrillas.''   He said, ``This kind of act goes to show they (the rebels) arenot looking for peace, but rather trying to provoke a vengefulresponse by security forces.''   Cristiani said the guerrillas hoped to prompt an increase inabuse of human rights by security forces that guerrillasympathizers could use to isolate his government.   El Salvador depends heavily on U.S. economic and military aid.U.S. officials have said continued aid will depend on the newgovernment's human rights record.   The guerrillas, in a March 17 broadcast on their clandestineRadio Venceremos, accused the attorney general's office of``covering up for murderers.''   The broadcast did not refer to any specific incidents andcontained no explicit threat against Garcia.   Also Wednesday, President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is dying ofliver cancer, left El Salvador for a week's analysis and treatmentat Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.   Duarte's health is deteriorating, but he is expected to be ableto personally hand over power to Cristiani on June 1. Cristiani waselected on March 19.   The armed forces and the rebels meanwhile announced thatgovernment forces killed an Argentine doctor, identified as GustavoIslas Caceres, and a French nurse, Madelaine Languedoc, on Saturdayalong with Salvadoran guerrillas.   Rebel radio said the two foreigners and three rebels were killedafter being captured in an army attack on a rebel field hospital inSan Vicente province.   An armed forces communique said the foreigners were armedguerrilla fighters killed in combat along with seven Salvadoraninsurgents.   U.S. Ambassador William Walker told journalists the embassyconcluded the foreigners were killed in combat. Walker said nofield hospital existed at the battle site 30 miles east of SanSalvador.   Walker said the two were medical workers with the guerrillas butnoted such personnel frequently double as combatants. The embassybased its conclusions on armed forces information, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
