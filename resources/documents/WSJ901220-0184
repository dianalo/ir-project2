In his books&quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; and &quot;Awakenings,&quot;Dr. Sacks introduced the lay reader to bizarre cases and thelarger moral meaning that could be drawn from individualafflictions and how they were dealt with by patients, theirfamilies and doctors.   &quot;Awakenings,&quot; based on a true story, is about a group ofpeople who were beset by encephalitis and then fell into aliving sleep. After spending decades in this condition, onegroup of these Rip van Winkles was brought back to this worldin 1969 by a doctor who found out that they could beawakened. Their re-emergence, facilitated by drugs, was amiracle -- a miracle that lasted only briefly.</LP><TEXT>   The director Penny Marshall has gone straight to the heartof this complex story and made a powerfully poignant andilluminating film. She doesn't hesitate to push for the grandsentimental moment, but balances the teary stuff withrestraint and humor. To be sure, &quot;Awakenings&quot; seemscalculated to induce weeping -- and it does, without makingthe weeper feel cheap.   Robin Williams, in the part of Dr. Malcolm Sayer theneurologist, has become so accomplished and familiar an actorthat it's no longer shocking to see him outside his manicstand-up-comic persona. The movie's neurologist has been castas an absent-minded introvert, a man who's just come off afive-year stint observing the behavior of earthworms. Heleaves his car keys dangling in the outside lock all day anduses his refrigerator to store plants.   Mr. Williams plays this fuzzy little man nerdy to the lastdetail, down to his white socks. He walks with his shouldershunched awkwardly, like a 12-year-old who thinks he'll becomeinvisible if he wills himself to be. He is almost invisible;you can barely see his eyes peering out of the confluence ofbeard, glasses and hair. Yet there's always something twinklyabout Mr. Williams, even submerged like this. It's readilyapparent that this quiet, brainy guy just might spot amiracle because he's oblivious to everything else.   He's gone to Bainbridge Hospital in the Bronx, whichcaters to chronically ill neurological patients, to work inthe lab. At his job interview it becomes apparent to him thatthe job that's available isn't, as he thought, a researchjob. As it dawns on Dr. Sayer that he's being offered a staffposition, he seems panicky, in his quiet way. &quot;People?&quot; hesays.   The hospital is desperate; he is hired. An orderly leadshim to the ward referred to as &quot;The Garden&quot;; its inhabitantsare fed and watered. Instead of settling in comfortably tothese surroundings, where patients resemble researchspecimens not humans, Dr. Sayer determines to find flickersof life. He does, and this leads him to look for otherflickers, and to find the connections between the patientswho show signs of vitality behind their blank eyes.   His research leads him to a doctor who first analyzed the&quot;children who fell asleep&quot; back in the 1920s, during anoutbreak of encephalitis. Max von Sydow plays the elderlydoctor who shows the younger man films of the patients he'dobserved years before. In one of the movie's simple,clarifying moments, the older doctor tells the younger manthese patients don't know they've been &quot;asleep&quot; for 40 yearsor more. When pressed, the old man gives his reasoning: &quot;Thealternative is unthinkable.&quot;   Ms. Marshall and her screenwriter, Steven Zaillian,incorporate into their story many familiar movie tactics thatserve the purpose of moving things along without tarnishingthe story's delicate magic. So, as Dr. Sayer begins to testthe reflexes he's sure he sees in his patients, he rouses thepreviously indifferent nurses and orderlies to his cause.And, because every movie hero needs an antagonist, John Heardis called upon to play the doubting head doctor, Dr. Kaufman,whose main job is to give Sayer a challenge. Ms. Marshalleven manages to pull off the rather unnecessary parallelstory that requires Dr. Sayer to learn a lesson from hispatients. To further this line, the film makers have arrangeda wistful flirtation between nurse (Julie Kavner) and Sayer,her boss. He's oblivious, of course, until he watches hispatients return to life and realizes that they're not theonly ones who have been sleeping. Though this adherence toHollywood code that romance must be injected everywhere isn'tworthy of the film's general spirit, it doesn't diminish thepicture's emotional strength.   Meanwhile, in the medical plot line Dr. Sayer learns abouta drug he thinks will work on his patients, and convinces hissuperior, Dr. Kaufman, to finance an experiment on just onepatient. Robert De Niro plays the patient, a 50-year-old mannamed Leonard. Mr. De Niro was an ideal choice for this role,the adult whose personality stopped developing when he fellasleep as a smart, polite adolescent. The actor has anuncanny ability to appear sweetly free of experience, andthen to disintegrate into a confusion of tics and spasms asside effects take hold.   This film isn't a repeat of the marvelous trick Ms.Marshall pulled off before in &quot;Big,&quot; where Tom Hanks played a12-year-old inhabiting a 35-year-old man's body. Leonarddidn't -- poof] -- make an instant leap in age. He's been achild, year in and year out, for a very long time, tended byhis elegant and eloquent mother. When he realizes what hislife has been, his joy is severely mitigated by what he'slost -- and Mr. De Niro makes his loss vividly, sorrowfullyapparent.   As Leonard's mother, Ruth Nelson achieves a clear,wrenching beauty that stands out even among these exceptionalactors doing exceptional things.   ---   VIDEO TIP: To appreciate how much Ms. Marshall hasaccomplished here, it's worthwhile to look at her twoprevious films. When it was released there seemed little tonote in &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash,&quot; the director's first film, acomedy that seemed to indicate Ms. Marshall should stick toacting. Then she surprised everyone with the charming &quot;Big,&quot;whose success at the box office made Ms. Marshall a seriousplayer in the industry.</TEXT></DOC>
