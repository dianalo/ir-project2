The panel slashed $11 million from President Bush's proposedbudget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, money that would havepaid for the survey.   The project ``does not appear to be an appropriate use of publicfunding,'' the committee said.   In a report accompanying the $155.2 billion appropriations billfor the Health and Human Services, Labor and Education departmentsand for other agencies, the committee said: ``If such a survey isnecessary, it should be supported with nongovernmental funds.''   ``The Public Health Service is not to proceed with this study,''the committee report said.   The bill is headed for the House floor and then to the Senate.   The proposal to cancel the survey came from the subcommittee onlabor, health and human services and education, which approved thecancellation in a closed session. Subcommittee staffers refused tosay who proposed it.   Plans for the survey have been stalled at the Department ofHealth and Human Services, which includes the Public HealthService, since the Office of Management and Budget raised concernsin April about a pilot questionnaire designed to preceed the largersurvey of 20,000 Americans.   In response, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan directed public healthofficials to review the appropriateness of the questions proposedfor the pilot survey. Department officials say that since then thesurvey has been through several levels of review and is nowawaiting consideration of James Mason, the assistant secretary forhealth.   The pilot survey that had been submitted to OMB proposed to askparticipants when they last had sex, what they did and whethertheir partner was a man or women. It also asked questions aboutoral and anal sex and masturbation.   Backers said the survey was designed to develop a comprehensivepicture of Americans' sexual practices to help public healthofficials better understand the spread of AIDS.   Conservatives have lobbied strongly against the survey, sayingscientists already know that AIDS is spread through sexual contactand that the government has no business invading the sexual privacyof Americans.   James Brown, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, declinedto comment on the House action except to say ``we are reviewing thesituation.''   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said he was ``very disappointedthat this survey may not be done.''   He noted that a recent General Accounting Office report saidinformation from the survey was essential for projecting the numberof future AIDS cases and for planning health and hospital care forthe growing number of victims of the disease. The National Academyof Sciences also said such a survey was necessary for planning AIDSeducation efforts.</TEXT></DOC>
