For 1991 as a whole, net income rose 15% to $18.57 billionfrom $16.14 billion. Aided by gains from the sale of Treasuryand other investment securities and by a widening marginbetween the cost of banks' funds and the yield on assets,earnings for both the fourth quarter and all of 1991 were thehighest since 1988.</LP><TEXT>   Even though the banking industry is regaining strengthafter two bad years, the FDIC's report shows that banksremained cautious lenders. Total loans and leases outstandingshrank for the fourth consecutive quarter, falling $9.7billion in the final three months of last year to $2.05trillion. That's down 2.8% from a year earlier. By contrast,holdings of investment securities rose more than 10%.   The reluctance to lend worries the Bush administration,which is looking for strong signs of economic recovery beforethe election. &quot;This isn't an acceptable situation. Economicgrowth is tied directly to bank lending,&quot; Deputy TreasurySecretary John Robson yesterday told the National Council ofCommunity Bankers, which represents savings banks. &quot;It's timethe banks came out of hibernation and started lending.&quot;   Losses of federally insured savings banks narrowed sharplylast year, the FDIC reported. The industry's fourth-quarterloss shrank to $423 million from $1.4 billion a year earlier.For 1991 as a whole, losses shrank to $1.2 billion from $2.6billion in 1990. One reason for the improvement is that theFDIC closed 19 savings banks last year, thus removing some ofthe biggest money-losers.   Partially because of the failures, the number of savingsbanks fell 6% last year to 441. And failures may wellincrease. At the end of last year, there were 72 banks on theFDIC's problem list of weak banks, compared with 34 at theend of 1990.   The combined problem list of commercial and savings banksfell slightly to 1,069 at the end of last year from 1,081.But the size of problem banks -- most of which will survive-- is growing. Problem banks had aggregate assets of $611.1billion at the end of last year, up sharply from $408.8billion a year earlier.   &quot;Many of the largest commercial banks continue toexperience earnings problems,&quot; the FDIC said. &quot;High loan-lossprovisioning and increased overhead costs {possibly relatedto restructurings} combined to hold down large-bankearnings.&quot; Of the 49 commercial banks with assets of $10billion or more, 12 had losses last year. By contrast, only11% of all commercial banks had losses, the lowest proportionof losers since 1982. The problems are primarily bicoastal,with 26% of the banks in the Northeast posting losses and 18%of the banks in the West.   The combination of mergers and failures reduced the numberof commercial banks to 11,920 last year from 12,340 the prioryear and 14,404 as recently as 1985. Most experts expect thiscontraction to continue, even as general banking conditionsimprove.   Commercial banks wrote off $9.4 billion of bad assets inthe fourth quarter, the largest amount ever, but the ratio oftroubled assets declined as a share of total assets. Therewere other indications of improving soundness. Equity capitalrose to $232.2 billion, or 6.77% of total assets, the highestyear-end ratio in 20 years. And loan-loss reserves edged upto 72% of noncurrent loans from 71% at the end of 1990.   &quot;The combination of lower levels of noncurrent loans,increased equity capital and stable reserves could lead tolower loan-loss provisioning and improved earnings atcommercial banks in 1992,&quot; the FDIC concluded.</TEXT></DOC>
