The Miami Herald reported Sunday that during the past five years,46 percent of the people shot by police in Dade County have beenblack _ although blacks make up only 21 percent of the county'spopulation.   But 44 percent of those arrested have been black, nearlyidentical to the percentage of those shot.   The paper gathered information on 158 police shootings, including65 that were fatal, from the state attorney's office, the Dademedical examiner's office and the 18 police departments and federalagencies that had officers involved in shootings since 1983.   The shooting death of an unarmed black motorcyclist by aColombian-born policeman led to three days of civil unrest in Miamilast month. Deaths of blacks at the hands of policemen have causedtwo other civil disturbances during the 1980s.   Officials said the statistics showed no significant evidence of apattern of bias among Dade law enforcement officers of any ethnicbackground.   ``We reviewed it about two to three years ago and reached thesame conclusion,'' said Dade State Attorney Janet Reno. ``If thereis any indication of a pattern, we will look at it again.''   ``We don't contest all shootings,'' said Aleem Fakir, executivedirector of People United To Lead the Struggle For Equality, a groupof black church and civic leaders critical of police treatment ofblacks. But Fakir said that seldom do ``whites get shot under cloudycircumstances.''   The analysis found no unusual racial pattern among the officersinvolved in shooting incidents, either.   Countywide, 9 percent of the police shootings were done by blackofficers, 29 percent were by Latin officers and 49 percent by Angloofficers. That ratio generally reflects the ethnic makeup of thecounty's combined law enforcement departments. The other 13 percentof cases involved two or more officers of different ethnicbackgrounds.   ``I think most police shootings are colorblind,'' said MiamiPolice Chief Perry Anderson, who is black. ``The shooting isprecipitated by an unlawful violation. It may be related to drugs orrobbery or burglary. You can't say there is prejudice.''</TEXT></DOC>
