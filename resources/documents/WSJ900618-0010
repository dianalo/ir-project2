The company said it expects to receive by the end of Junea net payment of about $594 million but that the gain will beoffset by income taxes and a charge that will also be bookedin the second quarter. The amount of the charge isundetermined, in line with the completion of a study underwhich the company has targeted specific worksites forenvironmental cleanup.</LP><TEXT>   In the year-earlier quarter, the energy concern had netincome of $497 million, or 96 cents a share, on revenue of$6.76 billion.   The settlement ends Amoco's claims for compensation forthe seizure by Iran of its two major Iranian operations in1978 and 1979. In Washington, U.S. officials said thesettlement wouldn't have any direct bearing on the chances ofgaining release of the six U.S. hostages still held bypro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. &quot;It's really not related,&quot;said a senior State Department official, pointing out thatIran will be paying money, not receiving it.   Nevertheless, the Bush administration privately hopes thatsuch progress at The Hague, and the promise of more, willhelp induce economically strapped Iran to prod the Lebanesekidnappers into fresh releases. President Bush has adopted apolicy of making whatever gestures appear reasonable in theirown right -- such as working to clear up claims -- and hopingTehran interprets them as favorable gestures.   However, claims settlements so far seem to have had littleimpact on the hostage problem. After a series of claimssettlements last month, no hostages were released, and Iran'sline even seemed to harden. Tehran and its allies aredemanding the release of Shiite prisoners from Israel andKuwait before any more hostages are released, and anti-U.S.feelings have been rising in the Middle East lately as thewar of words against Israel has heated up.</TEXT></DOC>
