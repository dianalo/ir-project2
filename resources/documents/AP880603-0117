(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Killer-rapist William Archie Fain, whoserelease caused a public outcry, has been ordered to stand trial oncharges of attempting to rape a preschool teacher and slashing herface.   The ruling came Thursday from Municipal Court Judge Peggy Horaafter a six-week preliminary hearing in which she twice threatenedone of Fain's attorneys with contempt.   Fain, 42, was ordered to appear in Alameda County Superior Courtin Oakland June 17, when a trial date will be set.   Fain was paroled in 1983 after serving 16 years in prison formurdering a 17-year-old boy and raping two 16-year-old girls nearthe Stanislaus County town of Oakdale.   Public outcry followed news of his scheduled release and thestate parole board canceled it. State courts ruled the actionillegal and ordered him freed. Gov. George Deukmejian then tried toblock his parole, but the courts ruled against the governor.   Fain, who remains in custody without bail, is charged in a Jan.22 attack on Jean Marie James at the Montessori Children's Center.   He is accused of breaking into the school, throwing the20-year-old woman to the ground, straddling her and slashing herfrom the upper lip to the nose.   Fain has pleaded innocent to charges of burglary, assault,attempted rape, assault with intent to commit rape and being armedwih a deadly weapon while committing the other crimes.   Fain's lawyers, Robert Bell and Ralph Lopez, were ordered tocome back to Hora's court July 12, when a hearing will be set todetermine if the two should be fined up to $1,500 each forallegedly causing unnecessary delays.   Hora twice threatened to cite Bell for contempt, saying he wasnot prepared and was wasting the court's time. Bell said he willseek a change of venue for Fain's trial.   Since his release, Fain has been acquitted of failing toregister as a sex offender in California and Arizona, and convictedand sentenced to jail for loitering in San Jose and drunken drivingin Santa Cruz and Fremont.</TEXT></DOC>
