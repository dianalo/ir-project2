The seemingly arcane bond issue is in fact a serious obstacle tothe Soviet Union's hopes of borrowing money in the United States.   ``We've got a pile of obstacles that high,'' said ValerySorokin, economic counselor at the Soviet embassy, holding his handabout two feet above a coffee table. Sorokin has compiled a 33-pagesummary of problems that slow trade between the two countries.   Negotiators have worked for over a year on the issue of bondsthat the Soviets repudiated when they took power after theoverthrow of the czar. Sorokin said there has been little progress.The Soviets have made agreements with Britain and Switzerland toredeem such bonds held by citizens there for a few cents on thedollar.   One Soviet official, speaking anonymously, estimated the bonds'face value as high as $300 million. They were issued by railroadsand other privately owned business under the czar.   ``We get letters from Americans every once in a while, asking uswhat to do with them,'' Sorokin said in an interview.   A few dealers have been willing to buy them for small sums.Collectors have admired the certificates for their elaborateengraving. They were not considered to have any other value, sosome were destroyed because they were creased or discolored.   The government that ruled Russia just before the Soviet takeoverin 1917 was allied with the United States against Germany in WorldWar I. It got $192.6 million worth of loans from the United States.The Soviets repudiated those loans too and made their own peacewith Germany.   President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. troops to Russia in acombined action with Britain, France and Japan. The Sovietgovernment under Josef Stalin and his successors diligently keptthe memory of that brief conflict alive, though it has beenforgotten by most Americans.   ``We have our claims, too,'' Sorokin said.   With accumulated interest, the wartime loan claim now amounts toalmost $1 billion. As long as it is not settled, a law passed in1934 bars the Soviets from floating commercial loans in thiscountry.   On Thursday, members of Congress asked Bush to make a priorityissue of waiving another obstacle to commerce between thesuperpowers, the Jackson-Vanik amendment. That law keeps tariffshigh against Soviet exports because of Soviet restrictions onemigration, now considerably eased.   Trade between the two nations faces other restrictions as well.One U.S. law says no government agency can help the Soviets getloans of more than $300 million _ not a large sum in world finance.It makes an exception only for the Commodity Credit Corporation,which lends to purchasers of U.S. farm products. But because of themore far-reaching Jackson-Vanik amendment, the Soviets have neverbeen able to use that exception for their huge purchases ofAmerican grain.   A 1986 law bans gold imports from South Africa as a sanctionagainst race segregation laws, and also includes the Soviet Unionin the ban. Those are the world's two biggest producers of gold.   A spokesman for MTB Banking Corp., which opens an exhibit ofcoins in New York next week, said it will show Soviet silver andpalladium coins but no gold ones.   ``They wouldn't let us bring in any samples,'' said ChrisUllman, ``not even a collection of historic coins from theHermitage Museum in Leningrad.''</TEXT></DOC>
