Roseum Wr.) in slurryfermentation systems using untreated orange peel as substrate was studiedin a laboratory-fermenter scale to reproduce the results obtained ina shaken-flask fermenter. The eventual effect of impeller speed on mechanicaldisruption of mycelial hyphae was then assessed by determining mycelialgrowth, total reducing sugars consumption, TOC reduction, carbon dioxideevolution and oxygen absorption rates. In particular, the main biomassyield coefficient, as well as the apparent specific growth rate, appearedto be independent of the impeller speed, at least within the experimentalrange of 450 and 900 min/sup -1/ (equivalent to peripheral impeller speedsof 3.8-7.5 m sec /sup -1/.</TEXT></DOC>
