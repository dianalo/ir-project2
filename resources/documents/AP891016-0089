(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A countdown suspended for five daysby a failed engine computer resumed without a hitch today and afederal appeals court removed a legal obstacle to Tuesday's launchof space shuttle Atlantis.   Hours after the countdown started up, an appeals court inWashington dismissed environmentalists' request to stop the launchbecause of the nuclear-powered Galileo spaceship that will beaboard.   The anti-nuclear activists, who had appealed a lower court'srejection of their request, fear that a Challenger-style accidentcould poison the atmosphere with plutonium from Galileo's powerpack.   But the three-judge appeals panel, headed by chief judgePatricia Wald, said last week's order by U.S. District Judge OliverGasch was not appealable.   More than 30 activists marched this morning on a Kennedy SpaceCenter gate about 10 miles from the launch pad. Eight of them werearrested on trespassing charges after they walked through a line ofsecurity guards at the gate.   The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice has threatened tostop Tuesday's liftoff by infiltrating the launch area danger zone.   The countdown was resumed at 12:01 a.m. when the traditionalcall to stations summoned workers to their posts in the controlcenter and on the launch pad.   ``We see nothing standing up and going to bite us,'' NASA testdirector Al Sofge said today after workers had completed earlytasks, including checks of the guidance system and preparations forfueling the spaceship.   Liftoff of Atlantis and its crew of five astronauts was set fora 26-minute period starting at 12:57 p.m. Tuesday. That's whenEarth and Jupiter will be aligned properly for Galileo to orbit thegiant planet in 1995 after a six-year voyage.   The weather outlook was improving with forecasters todayincreasing from 70 to 80 percent the chance that conditions will begood at launch time.   Shuttle managers on Sunday gave the go-ahead to restart thecountdown after assessing the readiness of the shuttle andreplacing the bad computer that forced a postponement of thelaunch, scheduled originally for last Thursday.   ``We retested the computer and everything looks fine,'' testdirector Mike Leinbach told reporters.   Astronaut Donald Williams, who commands Atlantis' crew, praisedtechnicians who worked around the clock for four days to make thecomputer swap, saying they ``did a super job.''   Launch preparations were taking place under the tightestsecurity ever for a shuttle flight because of the threats fromanti-nuclear activists. In all, 49.4 pounds of radioactiveplutonium-238 will be aboard to provide electricity to operateGalileo's systems.   Large areas of the Kennedy Space Center were closed to thepublic and the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationmobilized more than 200 armed guards and helicopter and boatpatrols.   The astronauts are to release the $1.5 billion Galileo fromAtlantis' cargo bay about 6{ hours after they reach orbit. An hourlater, a rocket motor will start the 6,700-pound craft on aroundabout trip that will cover 2.4 billion miles to Jupiter.   In December 1995, a 737-pound probe released from Galileo is toplunge into Jupiter's cloud layers and take the first samples ofthe Jovian atmosphere.   The main Galileo craft will enter an orbit around the planet,and its cameras and 10 scientific instruments will gatherinformation on temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloudcharacteristics and gravity.   Galileo also will study Jupiter for clues to the formation ofthe solar system. Many scientists believe the planet still holdsmuch of the material, in the original state, from which the sun andplanets formed 4.6 billion years ago.   Planners say the craft's investigations of Jupiter will be themost scientifically rich interplanetary mission yet. The picturesit relays will be up to 1,000 times sharper than those obtained bythe Voyager spacecrafts.   ``Galileo will give us more than just snapshots in passing, asthe Voyagers did,'' said Edward C. Stone, one of the missionscientists. ``Being there and observing over a period of nearly twoyears will allow us to sort out the dynamics of Jupiter and itsmoons.''</TEXT></DOC>
