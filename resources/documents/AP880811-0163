Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, a conservativeRepublican on the House Judiciary Committee, said a critical NRAletter sent to his constituents was ``downright erroneous, falseand plays on hysteria in an attempt to get me to change my vote.''   Sensenbrenner was strongly backed by Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif.,a Judiciary Committee member who has backed past NRA positions; andRep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., who considers himself a strongsupporter of the right to own guns.   Lungren called the attack on Sensenbrenner ``a pretty desperateletter against one of their supporters.''   Bateman, whose constituents received an NRA letter against thewaiting period that did not attack him personally, said: ``I amshocked and disappointed at the excessive language and tactics usedby the NRA in the letter to my constituents.''   This is not the first time in recent months that longtimesupporters of the NRA were sharply critical of the organization.   In May, Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., criticized the NRA forattacking him in his state when he and the pro-gun group differedover a version of legislation to ban undetectable plastic guns.   ``I think their influence has deteriorated some,'' Exon saidthen.   The waiting period measure, part of omnibus drug legislationthat the House will vote on in September, would require a seven-daywait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer.   The dealer must send to law enforcement authorities a swornstatement that includes a description of the gun, the serialnumber, the name, address and birth date of the buyer. Police may,but are not required to, conduct a background check.   Purchasers who would be prohibited from buying the handgun wouldbe those already ineligible under existing federal law: convictedfelons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, thoseadjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution,those dishonorably discharged from the military and people underindictment for a felony.   Twenty-two states already have enacted a waiting period ofvarying duration.   The ``emergency'' letter to NRA members in Sensenbrenner'sdistrict said the lawmaker, along with sponsors of the legislation,``are attempting to scapegoat the drug problem on the backs oflaw-abiding American gun owners _ to use it as an excuse to imposetotal federal gun control on America.''   Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute forLegislative Action, the group's lobbying arm, also wrote:   `I have in my hand a letter dated July 1988 from theSensenbrenner Campaign Committee for Re-Election proclaiming hisfight for gun owners' rights ... HA. With support like that, youmight as well have Ted Kennedy representing you.''   Kennedy, D-Mass. is one of the most liberal senators and is astrong supporter of handgun control.   Sensenbrenner, noting the waiting period is part of the drugbill, told reporters: ``If the National Rifle Association wishes todefeat Congress' singular effort this year to put an end to drugtrafficking, that's a record that they will have to live with.''   He quoted from an old NRA statement saying waiting periods wouldbe effective in ``reducing crimes of passion and in preventingpeople with criminal records and dangerous mental illness fromacquiring guns.''   LaPierre, in an interview, said the NRA supported waitingperiods in the early 1970s, but changed its mind a few years laterwhen it found ``they don't stop crime. It's simply red tape forhonest people.''   LaPierre said the group singled out Sensenbrenner for specialcriticism _ despite his past support of the NRA _ because of hiscampaign letter characterizing himself as a strong supporter of gunownership.   Sensenbrenner voted for the waiting period in the JudiciaryCommittee and added Thursday he will support the language on theHouse floor.   ``Come on. You don't have it both ways,'' LaPierre said.``Everybody knows this (the waiting period) is a big gun vote.You're either for gun owners or against gun owners.''   ``If someone is going to vote for a bill that takes these rightsaway ... we're going to fight back. That's what sportsmen and gunowners expect us to do.''   The NRA contends the waiting period would amount to a nationalregistration of handguns, would cost ``hundreds of millions'' ofdollars to enforce, and would require ``a bureaucrat's permission''to buy a gun.   Supporters of the legislation deny all those claims.</TEXT></DOC>
