The Japanese, who initially will provide $1 billion ininsurance guarantees for U.S. exports, apparently agreed tothe program in order to ease trade frictions with Washington.</LP><TEXT>   Yoshio Ichiryu, senior executive director of the Ministryof International Trade and Industry's export-import insurancedivision, said U.S. exporters are likely to receive Japaneseassistance for shipments to such developing countries asMexico, Indonesia and Thailand. In the past, the U.S. hascomplained that Japan has undercut American exporters byoffering its own companies generous financing for sales todeveloping countries.   In addition, some of the Japanese financing will help U.S.exports to Japan, whose market the U.S. contends is stillrelatively closed to American products.   The U.S. Export-Import Bank, which is managing theprogram, said it is a &quot;unique&quot; cooperative venture aimedprimarily at boosting U.S. exports. MITI credited JohnMacomber, chairman of the U.S. Ex-Im Bank, with havingbroached the idea.   Under the program, the U.S. Ex-Im Bank will &quot;co-finance&quot;projects, mostly in developing-country projects, with theMITI unit, according to Eugene Lawson, the U.S. agency's vicechairman. He said MITI will augment its initial $1 billionkitty if the export opportunities demand it.   Two other Japanese agencies, the Japanese Export-ImportBank and the Japan Development Bank, also will participate inthe program. Details of the Japanese Ex-Im bank'sparticipation are still to be announced, but it is expectedthe agency will directly help U.S. companies export goods toJapan. Currently, the Japanese bank assists U.S. exports onlyby providing loans to the Japanese buyers.   The Japanese Ex-Im Bank says the program will accelerate ashift in its import-financing policy. &quot;We are trying tofinance imports of more manufactured goods, rather than justraw materials,&quot; an official said.   The Japan Development Bank, for its part, said it willchip in with long-term credits to finance the construction ofwarehouses and other physical facilities that U.S. suppliersmay need in Japan.   &quot;None of these Japanese agencies have similar arrangementswith other countries,&quot; asserted Mr. Lawson.   MITI said that the program could enable U.S. suppliers tocapture as much as $600 million in business on a number oftransportation and energy projects that it has identified inMexico, Indonesia and Thailand. Because products shipped fromthe U.S. could contain a large number of foreign-suppliedparts, the MITI program will apply only to shipments with aU.S. content of 49% or more, MITI officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
