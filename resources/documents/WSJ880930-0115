Dorfman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR PUB </IN><TEXT>   Pity the poor securities analyst. It isn't enough to be a champion stock-picker. To make it really big these days, you also need a seal of approval from Institutional Investor.    Every year, the magazine sponsors a contest in which it asks institutional investors to cast votes for their favorite analysts. The magazine won't say exactly how it then picks a roster of analysts it considers the best in the nation -- votes alone aren't the answer -- so it is impossible to say how fair the survey is.    The highest-rated analysts get their pictures on the cover of the soon-to-be-released October issue as members of an &quot;All-America Team.&quot; But making the list means more than just fame and glory for the analysts. There is money to be made on this contest.    The 60-odd analysts who claim the highest rating in their specialties can command salaries of $400,000 or more from their employers. Runners-up typically earn $250,000 and more a year.    What if a brokerage firm won't cough up the dough demanded by an All-American? Another brokerage firm undoubtedly will -- to better its own standing on the survey. Institutional Investor not only rates the analysts, it also ranks the firms, based on how many of their analysts make its roster. A good showing helps firms attract lucrative investment-banking business.    Last year, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. came in first, with 45; First Boston Corp. ranked second, with 44. Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. tied for third, with 32 analysts each.    Many firms use the list to hire and fire, though some won't admit to it. Jack Rivkin, research director at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., says he uses the list to measure an analyst's performance. &quot;A lot of people say it's not important, and that's ridiculous,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm not going to hire an analyst not competitive enough to want to be recognized. If an analyst doesn't demonstrate those competitive instincts, it's a missing element -- and it's not an element I'm prepared to let slide.&quot; Last year, Shearson ranked 15th on the list.    Even analysts' assistants can make their bosses' stardom pay off handsomely. Patricia McConnell, an assistant to a top-ranked accounting analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co., says she was offered a job last year at Shearson. Shearson offered the job with the expectation she would surpass her mentor on Institutional Investor's list. &quot;At the very least, they expected me to be No. 2,&quot; she said.    Ms. McConnell says she turned down the offer, but not before negotiating a raise at Bear Stearns.    With so much at stake, some question whether the survey really measures analysts' prowess at picking stocks or their political skills. Many analysts don't hesitate to grub for votes from the money managers who cast ballots.    A few analysts ask for their votes flat out, among them Elaine Garzarelli, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. analyst who for the past four years has held the highest rating in quantitative analysis. One money manager says he hears from her &quot;only at that time of year,&quot; and that she puts on &quot;a hard sell.&quot;    Ms. Garzarelli sees it differently. &quot;I usually talk on the telephone to my clients when I have changes in my outlook,&quot; she says. &quot;Around voting time, if I happen to see them, I say, 'Try to remember me this year.' I've never gone up and asked for votes from strangers.&quot;    Ms. Garzarelli says she does less lobbying now than in years past, when she was a young and struggling analyst with A.G. Becker andamp; Co. &quot;As soon as I got on the team, everything changed,&quot; she says. &quot;I got a research assistant. I got a bigger budget. I got more calls from the press. I got invited to be on Wall Street Week,&quot; the television talk show.    Carl DeBiase, a former top-rated analyst who now owns a restaurant-industry information service, says he used to give extra stock tips to clients he expected would vote in the magazine's poll. The stocks typically were too small for an institution to buy, but his tips often made money for his clients' personal portfolios, Mr. DeBiase says. (Mr. DeBiase didn't disclose the names of those individuals to whom he gave the stock tips.)    Most analysts prefer a slightly more subtle approach. Jerome Gitt, whose 13-year streak as the top-rated savings-and-loan analyst is the longest in the contest's history, recalls how he set a quota for himself years ago with the specific goal of winning enough votes to make the magazine's list: He would make at least five telephone calls a day to clients. At voting time, he hoped they would remember his helpfulness.    Mr. Gitt, who works for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., says he doesn't bother with quotas anymore. It's &quot;stupid to call five people a day whether I've got anything to say to them or not,&quot; he says. But he still frets about making the list. &quot;Every year,&quot; he says, &quot;I say to myself I don't care. Then I say, let me stay No. 1 for one more year.&quot;    Ironically, the very institutions for which the list is compiled -- pension funds, insurance companies, banks and mutual funds -- say they don't take the contest that seriously. In fact, some consider it a nuisance, and don't even bother to cast ballots. Prudential Insurance Co. of America dismisses the list; it just shows &quot;who is popular,&quot; the firm says. Prudential says it doesn't bother to return the magazine's ballots.    IDS Financial Services Inc., a financial services firm and a unit of American Express Co., says it doesn't vote either. Michael P. Ducar, the firm's director of research, says the list &quot;works against people like ourselves,&quot; because star analysts are drawn increasingly into investment banking (arranging stock and bond issues for companies) and away from research.    Some institutions even go so far as to say they won't vote for up-and-coming analysts whose work they admire, lest they alert competitors to a good source of stock-market advice. &quot;It's kind of dumb when you think about it to vote your best research sources onto the All-America list,&quot; says Douglas Love, director of research at BEA Associates, a money management firm in New York. &quot;The analysts we deal with know that we're not going to vote for them.&quot;    For its part, Institutional Investor defends the integrity of its survey. The magazine says it distributes ballots to 1,000 money-management organizations, and follows up with reporting in which &quot;the opinions of more than 2,000 individuals have been tapped.&quot; Institutional Investor says it has sources who contribute even at those institutions that don't return ballots.    Not all votes are equal. Editors say they give more weight to a vote from a big institution than one from a small bank in Kansas.    Peter Landau, the magazine's editor, won't say how many ballots are returned. &quot;It's a lot and it's big, and it produces the team,&quot; he says. &quot;This year, it's more than ever.&quot; Besides, he adds, except for a few sour-grapes complaints, &quot;I don't know anybody who says 'Boy, are they wrong.'&quot;    The magazine's secrecy irks a lot of people on Wall Street, though. Manny Korman, director of research for Dean Witter Reynolds, says he and others have asked the magazine several times for an explanation of how it compiles the list, and have been rebuffed. The list has become &quot;a powerful, powerful weapon,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to know what it means.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
