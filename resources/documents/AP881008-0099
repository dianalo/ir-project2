The unemployment rate dropped fully two-tenths of apercent in September to 5.4 percent for all civilian workers and5.3 percent when you include the military. But behind these numbersis more good news _ 255,000 got new jobs last month in the non-farmsector, which means that since the recovery began in 1982, over 18million new jobs have been created. There's nothing more pleasingthan watching America move forward with purpose and the newsreminds us yet again that this great nation is, as Senator DanQuayle said, the envy of the world.   Now, I'd like to turn to another subject, the war on drugs. Iwant all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won, not by along shot, but we're doing better and our nation is united againstthis scourge as never before. Right now there is a drug bill onCapitol Hill. It has passed the House but hasn't even come up forconsideration in the Senate and time is fast running out.   The House bill has many good and tough provisions that expressour national commitment to five simple, but powerful, words. Thosewords are ``zero tolerance'' and ``Just say no.'' When we say zerotolerance, we mean simply that we've had it. We will no longertolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. AllAmericans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasiteswho survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitalityand humanity of others. They must pay.   We believe that when those who sell drugs are caught, they mustmake redress for the damage they cause. That's why theadministration, personified by the leadership and passion of thisadministration's point man on drugs, Vice President George Bush,and the national voice of conscience, my wife Nancy, has advocatedtougher measures than ever before to combat the drug runners andthe drug dealers.   We are doing this by seizing the ill-gotten possessions of drugdealers and their accomplices. Those fancy cars and fancy housesand bank accounts full of dirty money aren't really theirs. Theywere bought from the sale of illegal blood pollutants. We do nottolerate companies that poison our harbors and rivers, and we won'tlet people who are poisoning the blood of our children get awaywith it either.   Those who have the gall to use federally subsidized housing topeddle their toxins must get the message as well. We will nottolerate those who think they can do their dirty work in the samequarters where disadvantaged Americans struggle to build a betterlife. We want to kick the vermin out and keep them out.   Nor can we allow these people to hide behind bizarre legalchallenges when we do arrest them, and we must work to see themjailed. And that's why we're advocating a change in the law thatwill allow exceptions in the so-called ``exclusionary rule'' topermit the use in court of evidence gathered in good faith by thepolice. Nor can our vigilance cease once they're behind bars.   George Bush has proposed, and I support, drug testing for allwho seek early release from jail, to send them this message, ``Youdon't go free until you're drug free.'' We won't have a drug-freesociety until we manage to stop the drugs before they get to ourshores. We must protect our coasts, and that means using theresources and calling on the noble men and women of the Coast Guardto protect us.   We've sought increases in the drug enforcement budget, but inthe past we've encountered consistent resistance from Congress. Irequested $538 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration infiscal 1989, but Congress hacked $33 million away.   I think drug enforcement is too important a matter for this kindof political behavior, and I imagine you agree with me. But thereis a way more vital than all of these, that we can express ourrevulsion at violence and degradation of the life of the drugpeddler. These people seem to feel nothing, no fear, no remorse,nothing, when they pull out a machine gun and murder a policeofficer in the line of duty.   The bill that has passed the House provides for the deathpenalty for these vicious killers. We must, we need, and we willhave this law. Now, there are those who've opposed the House billbecause it includes the death penalty. Others oppose it because ofthe good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.   I believe these people are more concerned with the abstractrights of criminals than the right of our society to save itselffrom those, in this country and outside, who seek their fortune inour national misfortune.   I challenge the U.S. Senate to get that bill passed. The nationdemands it and there's no time to waste. Compromises on the keyprovisions are unacceptable. We must let the drug kingpins knowyour days are numbered. Our cause is just, and we will triumph.   Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.</TEXT></DOC>
