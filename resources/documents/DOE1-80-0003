In the normal individual, asufficiently intense physiologic stress may increase coronary flow andcardiac output by 500% to 600%. However, in patients with cardiac disease,these reserve responses may be absent, or considerably blunted. Thus,physiologic stress testing has proved extremely helpful in detectingcardiac abnormalities when resting cardiac function appears normal. Althoughdynamic exercise remains the standard approach to physiologic stresstesting, a number of other interventions have been used, including: (1)isometric exercise, (2) atrial pacing, (3) cold pressor testing, (4)postextrasystolic potentiation, (5) volume loading, and (6) negativeintrathoracic pressure. Each of these may be considered an alternativephysiologic intervention whenever dynamic exercise is not feasible. Thesealternative approaches are important since, in our experience, 20% to30% of subjects are unable to perform dynamic exercise, or exercise inadequatelyto produce a sufficiently intense cardiac stress. This chapter reviewsphysiologic considerations, indications, contraindications, protocols,and results of these physiologic stress interventions when used in combinationwith cardiac radionuclide procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
