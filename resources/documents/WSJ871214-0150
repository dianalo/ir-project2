Almost across the board, government and industry economists expect food prices to rise only 2% to 4% next year, mainly because some wholesale meat prices are expected to fall to their lowest levels in a decade. In its latest meat-price outlook, the Agriculture Department estimates retail chicken prices will fall 7% to 10% and pork prices will fall 8% to 12%. Beef prices should be relatively stable.    If the predictions prove true, it would be the fifth year in a row that overall food prices have risen less than 4%, and should be a big stabilizing effect on overall inflation for 1988.    &quot;It will be a positive factor in holding down overall inflation and providing consumers with additional spending money for other purchases,&quot; says Richard Pottorff, an economist with WEFA Group Inc., a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., econometrics firm.    An abundance of meat supplies is the most important factor behind the falling prices. The Agriculture Department predicts that 990 million pounds of red meat and poultry will be on hand at the beginning of the year. Coupled with increased production in most sectors, that should bring total meat supplies next year to a whopping 64.57 billion pounds, the highest in U.S. history.    Poultry producers are expected to increase production 5%, according to the Agriculture Department, which should lead to a 16% decline in wholesale prices. That would put wholesale prices at 40 cents to 46 cents a pound -- the lowest since the late 1970s.    Pork slaughter is expected to rise 12% next year as an expansion that began in summer 1986 moves into high gear, says Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., a commodity-research firm in Arlington Heights, Ill.    With 15.9 billion pounds of pork available to the market, average wholesale prices should decline 20% to 30%, the Agriculture Department says. Analysts predict that hog prices may bottom out next summer in the mid-to-high $30-a-hundred-weight range.    Grain and oilseed prices should rise a bit next year, says John Urbanchuk, an economist with the Government Research Corp., Washington, D.C., a private forecasting concern. He foresees a 4.3% rise in average corn prices to $1.95 a bushel, a 2.8% rise in soybean prices to $5.15 a bushel and a 6.6% rise in wheat prices.    The increases, however, should have little effect on packaged-food prices like cereal and bakery products. The Agriculture Department estimates that farmers receive less than 10% of the total prices consumers pay for most packaged goods. Production and transportation costs figure more prominently, and economists don't expect those costs to rise much.    &quot;These prices aren't sufficient to really do enough to the prices of processed foods,&quot; Mr. Urbanchuk says, referring to the raw commodity prices. &quot;We're not looking at a resurgence of inflation in processed foods as a result of increases in grain and oilseed prices next year.&quot;    The big supplies of pork and poultry will hold beef prices in check despite a slight drop in production, economists say. The drop will occur as producers use more animals for breeding rather than sending them to slaughter.    Economist say meat prices will be the most susceptible to economic gyrations. A recession would likely knock 6% to 7% off beef prices, according to WEFA Group. Producers would halt their expansion and send more animals to slaughter to increase supply, lower prices and hopefully lure consumers away from low-priced meats like chicken and pork. </TEXT></DOC>
