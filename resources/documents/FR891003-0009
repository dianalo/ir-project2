Having reviewed and consideredthe comments on the proposed rule, BXA is now issuing this interim rulethat revises andSection; 776.12 of the Export Administration Regulations(EAR) to reduce U.S. export controls on U.S.-origin parts and componentsincorporated in foreign-made products. This change applies a 25% exemptionto all destinations, except that a 10% exemption_with no dollar value limitation_iscontinued for Country Groups S and Z, and Iran, Syria and the People'sDemocratic Republic of Yemen. Paragraph (h) of andSection; 776.12, whichaddressed controlled in fact entities, has been removed because of theexpansion of the 25% exemption.This rule also creates a new exemption based on the Advisory Notes thatindicate a likelihood of approval for exports to Country Groups Q, W, andY. Like the 25% exemption, the QWY Advisory Note exemption applies to alldestinations, except those located in Country Group S or Z, or in Iran,Syria or the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. A 10% exemption_withno dollar value limitation_applies to these destinations.The effect of this rule will be to reduce the licensing requirements thatwould apply to foreign products containing U.S.-origin parts and components.The Commerce Department will consider comments on these changes; especiallycomments concerning the economic impact on U.S. firms of retaining a 10%exemption_with no dollar value limitation_on Iran, Syria, the People'sDemocratic Republic of Yemen, and Country Groups S and Z.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective October 3, 1989.

Currently, when U.S.-origin parts and components arevalued at $10,000 or less and comprise 10% or less of the value of a foreign-madeproduct, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) permit the foreign-madeproduct to be exported from abroad to any destination without written U.S.authorization. Written U.S. authorization is also not required for exports,from foreign countries, of foreign-made products with a U.S. content valueof 25% or less to countries listed in Supplement No. 2 or 3 to part 773,except Ethiopia, Lebanon, and Nicaragua.The U.S. Department of Commerce proposed, on December 7, 1988 (53 FR 49327),to amend andSection; 776.12 of the Export Administration Regulations (15CFR parts 730-799) by making three significant revisions:(1) Expanding the existing 25% exemption to apply to countries not listedin Supplement No. 2 or 3 to part 773, and to Ethiopia, Lebanon, and Nicaragua,provided that the export of the foreign product to the new destinationwould be subject to U.S. national security controls only;(2) Creating an exemption from written authorization requirements thatapplies to foreign-made products containing U.S.-origin content when noneof the U.S. content, regardless of its value, exceeds the technical performancecharacteristics of any Advisory Note on the Commodity Control List thatindicates licenses are likely to be approved for export to satisfactoryend-users in Country Groups Q, W, and Y_unless the new destination is inEthiopia, Lebanon, or Nicaragua or in a country not listed in SupplementNo. 2 or 3 to part 773 and the export of the foreign product would be subjectto U.S. export controls other than, or in addition to, national securitycontrols; and(3) Revising the definition of ``U.S. content value'' in andSection; 776.12(d)to exclude parts, components, or materials that could be exported fromthe United States to the new country of destination under General LicensesG-COCOM, G-COM, or GFW, as well as General License G-DEST.The Department received public comments from 12 firms and associations.In general, the comments were opposed to the restrictions that the proposedrule placed on countries not listed in Supplement Nos. 2 or 3, and to Ethiopia,Lebanon, and Nicaragua. Most comments stressed that the proposed exemptionsshould apply to all destinations, regardless of the reason for control.Comments concerning the definition of the term ``U.S. content value''_whichwas revised to exclude components that may be exported to the new destinationunder General Licenses G-COCOM, G-COM, and GFW, as well as General LicenseG-DEST_were generally favorable. In drafting this interim rule, the Department has reviewed the public commentsthat address the scope of the 25% and QWY Advisory Note exemptions. Boththe 25% exemption and the QWY Advisory Note exemption described in theproposed rule are expanded to apply to all destinations_except for thoselocated in Country Group S or Z, or in Iran, Syria or the People's DemocraticRepublic of Yemen_regardless of the reason for control. A 10% exemption_withno dollar value limitation_will apply to destinations located in CountryGroup S or Z, or in Iran, Syria or the People's Democratic Republic ofYemen. This interim rule, like the proposed rule, revises the U.S. content thatis to be counted when calculating ``U.S. content value'' as defined inandSection;776.12(d). Parts, components, or materials that could be exportedfrom the United States to the new country of destination under GeneralLicenses G-DEST, G-COCOM, G-COM, or GFW may be excluded from the calculationof ``U.S. content value''. Previously, under the EAR, only G-DEST itemswere excluded from this calculation. Several comments expressed support for providing an exemption for U.S.-originparts and components incorporated in foreign-made supercomputers providedthat the U.S.-origin parts and components could be exported to the newdestination under General Licenses G-COCOM, G-COM, and GFW, as well asGeneral License G-DEST. These comments were not adopted. However, thisrule does clarify the supercomputer restriction by stating that exportsof U.S.-origin parts and components incorporated in foreign-made supercomputersmay be made under andSection; 776.12(b), Provided That these parts and componentsare eligible for export to the new destination under General License G-DEST.The Department will treat cases involving supercomputers on a case-by-casebasis. The interim rule also revises andSection;776.12(d). This section previouslypermitted U.S.-origin controlled spare parts to accompany a shipment ofa foreign-made product incorporating U.S.-origin parts and components,provided that the value of the spare parts did not exceed the value ofthe controlled U.S. content in the foreign-made product. The interim rulelimits the value of the U.S.-origin spare parts that may accompany sucha shipment to 10% of the value of the foreign-made product. This changeis made to ensure that only a reasonable complement of spares will be shipped.Exporters are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of andSection;779.8, a foreign-made product that is the direct product of U.S.-origintechnical data may require U.S. authorization regardless of the U.S. content.Exporters should be also aware that this rule deals only with U.S.-originparts and components incorporated in foreign-made products. Statutory provisionsrelated to U.S.-origin technical data that are used to produce foreign-madeproducts and to section 5(m) of the Act, ``Goods Containing ControlledParts and Components'', will be implemented in separate rules. Exporters have claimed that this change will significantly benefit exportsof U.S.-origin parts and components by encouraging foreign manufacturersto continue to use or even expand their use of U.S.-origin parts and componentsin their products. Industry has not quantified the increase in exportsthat may result from this change. The Department does not have adequatedata available to estimate the trade volume that might be affected by thesechanges. The Commerce Department will consider comments that address the changesmade by this interim rule, including comments on the economic impact onU.S. firms of retaining a 10% exemption_with no dollar value limitation_forIran, Syria, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and Country GroupsS and Z.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements </ITAG>1. This rule complies with Executive Order 12291 and Executive Order 12661.2. This rule contains a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0010. Public reporting burden forthis collection of information is estimated to average 25 minutes per response,including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing datasources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing andreviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burdenestimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, includingsuggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Security and ManagementSupport, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce,Room 3889, Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office Information and RegulatoryAffairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503_ATTN: PaperworkReduction Project (0694-0010). The effect of the rule will be to reducethe paperwork burden on the public. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. This rule is not subject to therequirements of section 13(b) of the Export Administration Act becauseit is not imposing new controls. Further, no other law requires that anotice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment begiven for this rule. However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations,this rule is issued in interim form and comments will be considered inthe development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encouragesinterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views.The period for submission of comments will close November 2, 1989. TheDepartment will consider all comments received before the close of thecomment period in developing final regulations. Comments received afterthe end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but theirconsideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept publiccomments accompanied by a request that part or all of the material be treatedconfidentially because of its business proprietary nature or for any otherreason. The Department will return such comments and materials to the personsubmitting the comments and will not consider them in the development offinal regulations. All public comments on these regulations will be a matterof public record and will be available for public inspection and copying.In the interest of accuracy and completeness, the Department requires commentsin written form. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, whichwill also be a matter of public record and will be available for publicreview and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Governmentor foreign governments will not be made available for public inspection.The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4886, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, includingwritten public comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oralcommunications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulationspublished in part 4 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
