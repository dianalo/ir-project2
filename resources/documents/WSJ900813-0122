Seib   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/13/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><IN>PETROLEUM (PET)</IN><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Iraq's claim to Kuwait, though summarilyrejected by the international community, has some shaky basisin history.   Iraq had asserted its right to control Kuwait even beforethe Kuwaiti state won its independence from Britain in 1961.</LP><TEXT>   Above all, that claim is based on the fact that, beforethe British dominated the region, the Ottoman Empire haddeclared that Kuwait was part of a province controlled fromthe Iraqi city of Basra. Iraq argues that the lines ofcontrol established in that Ottoman era should still apply,not borders later worked out by the British.   Iraq's claim is similar to those made over the years byother Middle East states dissatisfied with internationalborders largely drawn up by colonial powers decades ago. Butit isn't very solid by current international standards. Theal-Sabah family ousted by Iraq's invasion has ruled the areaaround Kuwait City for 234 years. Even before aligningthemselves with the British, the family had refused toacknowledge that it was subject to Ottoman control.   Kuwait's leaders in 1899 signed an agreement giving theBritish responsibility for their defense and foreign affairs,and in 1913 the British concluded an agreement recognizingthe autonomy of the leader of Kuwait. Kuwait's borders wereestablished at a conference held by the British in 1923, andthe country was granted its independence from Britain in1961.   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein &quot;has a very uphill battle&quot; tomake the case, says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholarwho has written a history of Iraq.   Still, in Iraqi eyes its claim is buttressed by longtimecultural and economic links between Kuwait and Iraq. Kuwaitisheiks, for instance, once owned large date plantations inIraq. And Iraq once provided nearly all of Kuwait's freshwater, until the Kuwaitis built big plants to desalinatePersian Gulf water, Ms. Helms says.   And there's a more current dispute that underlies theIraqi move. An oil field known as the Rumaila field straddlesthe Iraq-Kuwait border, and Iraq claims that Kuwait had beendrilling diagonally from its side of the border to tapreserves from the field lying under Iraqi territory. U.S.officials say there is reason to think the Iraqi claim may betrue.</TEXT></DOC>
