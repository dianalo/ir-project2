In conventionalwrought form, this alloy can be heat treated to yield strengths exceeding1378 MPA (200 ksi) with good ductility. The high iron content of thisalloy, however, makes it segregation prone and usage has therefore beenlimited. Powder metallurgy and rapid solidification via gas atomizationoffers a means for eliminating the segregation problem. This paper willdescribe the results of microstructural evaluation of gas atomized Ti-1A1-8V-5Fepowder and consolidated product. Mechanical properties of the consolidatedproduct will also be presented. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
