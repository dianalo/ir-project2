They avoid exertion and fear they might have heart disease evenafter medical tests show their hearts are normal, said psychiatristFrancis Kane Jr.   He and colleagues surveyed 371 people who had complained ofchest pain or other apparent heart trouble, but who showed no signof disease when tested with a procedure called an angiogram.   An angiogram detects narrowing of the arteries that supply bloodto the heart muscle. That narrowing can set the stage for heartattack.   Despite the angiogram findings, 56 percent of the people wereunsure about whether they had heart disease. Forty-five percentfeared that exertion would be dangerous, and 32 percent said theywere limited in physical activities.   Sixty-nine percent of the people qualified for diagnosis ofpanic attacks or another anxiety disorder, based on their answersto the survey, said Kane, psychiatry professor at the BaylorCollege of Medicine in Houston.   More than 1 million Americans have panic attacks, which inflictsudden bouts of intense terror for no apparent reason, according tothe American Psychiatric Association.   About half had been told their symptoms were due to stress, butonly 4 percent were told to seek mental health treatment and only17 percent were given tranquilizers, Kane said.   He spoke in an interview before presenting the study Tuesday atthe annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.   In a telephone interview, cardiologist Adolph Hutter ofMassachusetts General Hospital in Boston said anxiety and stressare not the only possible explanations for chest pain in peoplewith normal angiogram results.   More common causes in his professional experience, he said, area spasm in the esophagus, the muscular tube leading from thepharynx to the stomach, or a tenderness of cartilage in the chestwall.   Brian Doyle, clinical professor of psychiatry and of familymedicine at Georgetown Medical School, said Kane's paperillustrates ``the way it is.''   Cases of chest pains and breathing difficulties in response toanxiety crop up frequently in his work with family doctors, he said.   About 540,000 angiograms were performed in 1984, and the annualtotal has probably risen since, Kane said. About 10 percent to 45percent of such tests find no sign of heart disease, he said.   In Kane's study, 90 percent of the patients had suffered chestpain before the angiogram and a third had been hospitalized for it.About a third had complained of breathing difficulties, and smallerfractions had reported feelings of suffocation, palpitations,dizziness or sweating.   At the time they were surveyed, eight months to 18 months afterthe angiograms, 76 percent reported they still had chest pain, and37 percent said they were still seeing a doctor because of it.   Symptoms of chest pain, palpitation, breathlessness and fear offainting tended strongly to be reported by people who also appearedto suffer from panic attacks, the survey showed.   The survey also found that generalized anxiety disorder waslinked to persistent chest pain and belief that one had suffered aheart attack. Fifty-five percent of the sample believed they hadsuffered a heart attack, although only 2 percent had been told thatin the past.   Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by unrealistic orexcessive anxiety and worry about two or more circumstances ofone's life for six months or more.   While the study's use of questionnaires rather than interviewstends to make the diagnoses less secure, the results are consistentwith previous interview-based studies, said psychiatrist WayneKaton of the University of Washington in Seattle.   Doyle, who is leading a psychiatric association effort to helpphysicians recognize panic disorder, said many doctors overlookanxiety when analyzing physical symptoms.   And patients just don't like the idea, he said.   ``For most people, being told they have symptoms based onpsychological difficulties is a real insult,'' he said. ``It'sconsidered a sign of moral weakness. It's a personal failing, it'snot an acceptable diagnosis.''</TEXT></DOC>
