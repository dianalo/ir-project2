The initial question came after Kirkland, whose organizationendorsed the Massachusetts governor in the 1988 presidential race,said he believed ``a good, fighting candidate with a good, fightingcampaign'' could win the presidency, regardless of party affiliation.   Asked if Dukakis met that criteria, Kirkland smiled and said ``nocomment.''   Dukakis recently announced he would not seek a fourth term asgovernor. He said the announcment had nothing to do with plans foranother presidential campaign but others have speculated he isconsidering seeking a rematch with President Bush in 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
