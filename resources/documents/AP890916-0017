U.S. District Judge Charles Richey on Friday rejected a Bushadministration motion to dismiss the case, saying private citizensmay go to court to keep the government from erasing computer recordsdealing with the Iran-Contra affair.   FBI agents and congressional investigators delving into theIran-Contra affair used thousands of messages retrieved from thesystem, called PROFS, in piecing together the most far-reachingscandal of the Reagan administration.   Former White House aide Oliver North and former national securityadviser John Poindexter used the system, which serves as asubstitute for the telephone.   Richey's decision ``goes a long way toward ensuring that ...records produced by the president'' are ``preserved for futuregenerations so that chapters of history are not lost,'' saidKatherine Meyer, one of the lawyers who filed the case.   Richey said the Administrative Procedures Act empowers a privategroup to seek judicial review of the president's performance underthe Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act. He gavethe government and private groups and individuals filing the suituntil Jan. 2 to decide how to proceed.   The National Security Archive, a non-profit organization, went tocourt Jan. 19 after learning the Reagan White House was about todispose of the contents of the PROFS computer system.   On the eve of the change in administrations, a judge temporarilyenjoined the government from destroying the material. It includescomputer tapes of the NSC and the executive office of the presidentas well as back-up computer files.   Justice Department lawyers argue most of the notes aren'tpresidential or agency records, but are like telephone messages. Thejudge questioned that assertion in a 28-page opinion.   ``Were telephone conversations in the Executive Branch routinelytaped, a good portion would undoubtedly qualify as presidential oragency records,'' the judge said.</TEXT></DOC>
