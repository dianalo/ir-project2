S. Sargent (1895) from materialcollected in North Carolina, is a rhizomatous shrub. It is sometimes called``false poison sumac'' because of its superficial resemblance to <T3>Rhus vernix. </T3>The erect stems grow from 0.3 to 1 meter in height,and the entire plant is densely pubescent. The narrowly winged or winglessrachis supports 9 to 13 sessile, oblong to oblong-lanceolate leaflets thatare each 4 to 9 centimeters long, 2 to 5 centimeters wide, and acute toacuminate. The bases of the leaflets are rounded, and their edges are simplyor doubly serrate. Flowering in this dioecious species occurs in June.The small flowers are borne in a terminal, erect, dense cluster, with eachone being four- to five-parted and greenish-yellow to white. The fruit,which is a red, densely short-pubescent drupe, 5 to 6 millimeters broad,is borne on female plants form August to September (Radford <T3>et al. </T3>1964, Cooper <T3>et al. </T3>1977, Sargent 1895). <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>differs from other similar species of the genusby its short stature, dense overall pubescence, and evenly serrate leaflets.<T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>is a species endemic to the inner coastal plainand lower piedmont of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, whereit is currently known form 15 locations in North Carolina and 1 locationin Georgia. The species occurs in sandy or rocky open woods, perhaps inassociation with basic soils (Cooper <T3>et al. </T3>1977), and appears to be dependent upon some form of disturbanceto maintain the open quality of its habitat. Artificial disturbances, suchas railroad and highway right-of-way maintenance, are maintaining someof the openings historically provided by naturally occurring periodic fires.Thirty populations of <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>have been reported historically from 21 countiesin North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Sixteen of these populationsremain in existence in North Carolina and Georgia. The following is a summaryof the most current information for this species. <T3>Georgia: </T3>Four populations were reported historically in the Statefrom the counties of Newton, Rabun, Columbia, and Elbert. Only the ElbertCounty population is known to remain, with just four plants surviving.This site is on land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, leasedto the Georgia Department of Natural Resources as part of the Broad RiverWildlife Management Area (T. Patrick, Georgia Heritage Inventory, personalcommunication, 1988.) The Newton County population is believed to havebeen destroyed during the construction of a water tower. Causes for thedisappearance of the populations in Rabun and Columbia Counties are notknown.   <T3>South Carolina: </T3>One population was reported historically fromKershaw County. Although extensive searches have been conducted in thatarea and others of potentially suitable habitat, the species is believedto have been extirpated from the State.<T3>North Carolina:</T3> <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> was once known to occur at 25 sites in this State.The species has been extirpated at 10 of these localities, with the causesfor extirpation being largely unknown. One population is believed to havebeen extirpated in each of the following counties: Orange, Wake, Wilson,Robeson, Moore, Lincoln, Franklin, Durham, Mecklenberg, and Hoke. The distributionof the 15 extant populations by county is as follows.Three populations remain in Hoke County. One of these sites, with severalhundred female plants, is privately owned; another, with 23 plants, islocated on Ft. Bragg Military Reservation and is owned by the U.S. Departmentof Defense; and the third, a severely disturbed site where only four plantsremain, is partially in private ownership and partially owned by The NatureConservancy.Six populations occur in Richmond County. One of these (consisting of 2plants) is privately owned, and 4 (3 with less than 50 plants each andone with 137 plants) are located on land owned by the U.S. Department ofDefense that is leased and managed by the North Carolina Wildlife ResourcesCommission as part of the Sandhills Gamelands. The sixth population, withonly eight plants, is on Ft. Bragg Military Reservation, owned by the U.S.Department of Defense.Two populations occur in Scotland County on the Sandhills Gamelands, whichare managed by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and ownedby the U.S. Department of Defense. Both of these populations are large,with 1 covering an area of 76 meters by 137 meters, but contain only femaleplants. The other consists of 300 to 400 male plants.One population survives in each of the following counties: Franklin, Davie,Robeson, and Wake. The Franklin County population is privately owned andcontains over 250 plants of both sexes. The Davie County population, alsoin private ownership, consists of about 30 plants covering a 0.9-metersquare area. The Robeson County population, in private ownership, consistsof several hundred male plants. The Wake County population, owned by theCity of Raleigh, consists of 279 plants of both sexes.Many of these populations are in vulnerable locations, such as highwayrights-of-way or on the edges of plowed fields. Those which are not adjacentto some maintained opening or exposed to periodic disturbance are endangeredby natural succession.On December 15, 1980, the Service published a revised Notice of Reviewfor Native Plants in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(45 FR 82480); <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>was included in that notice as a category 1 species.Category 1 species are those for which the Service presently has sufficientinformation on hand to support the biological appropriateness of theirbeing listed as endangered or threatened species. Subsequent revisionsof the 1980 notice have maintained <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>in category 1.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>Sargent (Michaux's sumac) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. Rhus michauxii </T3>has been and continues tobe endangered by destruction or adverse alteration of its habitat. Sincediscovery of the species, 47 percent of the known populations have beenextirpated, partly as a result of conversion of habitat for silviculturaland agricultural purposes and for industrial and residential development.Fire suppression appears to be a problem for this species and will be discussedin detail under Factor E below. Of the 14 populations that have been extirpated,1 is known to have been eliminated by industrial development and one byconversion of the site to pine plantation. Causes for the extirpation ofthe others are unknown. Many of the remaining populations are on the edgesof highway or railroad rights-of-way or cultivated fields. Fourteen ofthe 16 remaining populations are currently threatened by habitat alteration.In addition to the major threats listed above, those populations on militaryland are potentially threatened by mechanized military training activities.Although this has not been a documented problem for this species thus far,some of the small sites occupied by the species could easily be destroyedby heavy, tracked vehicles such as tanks. Nonetheless, populations probablypersist on military lands and State gamelands where they have not survivedon adjacent privately owned land because of the prescribed burning programsof the Defense Department and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission,and periodic fires incidental to military training (J. Carter, North CarolinaState University, personal communication, 1987; J. Moore, North CarolinaNatural Heritage Program, personal communication, 1987). Activities associatedwith intensive timber management on publicly owned land, such as timberharvesting, road building, and conversion of habitat to pine plantation,if done in a manner not consistent with the protection of <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>populations, could adversely affect the species,as has been the case on private lands in the past.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational scientific, or educationalpurposes. Rhus michauxii </T3>is not currently a significant componentof the commercial trade in native plants. However, because of its smalland easily accessible populations, it is vulnerable to taking and vandalismthat could result from increased publicity.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Not applicable to this species at this time.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3><T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>is afforded legal protection in North Carolinaby North Carolina General Statutes, sections 106-202.12 to 106-202.19 (Cum.Supp. 1985), which provide for protection from intrastate trade (withouta permit) and for monitoring and management of State-listed species andwhich prohibit taking of plants without written permission of landowners.<T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>is listed in North Carolina as endangered and ofspecial concern (Sutter <T3>et al. </T3>1983). The species is recognized in South Carolina as extirpatedin the State and of national concern by the South Carolina Advisory Committeeon Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Plants in South Carolina; however,this State offers no official protection. The species is not listed bythe State of Georgia where it was thought to have been extirpated untilvery recently. State prohibitions against taking are difficult to enforceand do not cover adverse alterations of habitats, such as exclusion offire. The Endangered Species Act would provide additional protection andencouragement of active management for <T3>Rhus michauxii.</T3>E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>As mentioned in the ``Background'' section of this proposed rule,many of the remaining populations are small in numbers of individual stemsand in area covered by the plants. Of the 16 remaining populations, 9 haveless than 100 plants, with 3 of these containing less than a dozen plantseach. The rhizomatous nature of the species indicates that there are manyfewer individual plants in existence than stem counts would indicate. Inaddition, only two of the remaining populations contain both male and femaleplants. The dioecious nature of the species further increases the vulnerabilityof extremely small populations where plants of only one sex remain. Existingconditions at most of the occupied sites are indicative of low geneticvariability within populations, which makes it more important to maintainas much habitat and as many of the remaining colonies, particularly thosecontaining both sexes, as possible.Another potential threat to this species, particularly in populations whereonly a few plants remain, is hybridization with sympatric species suchas <T3>Rhus galbra </T3>and <T3>Rhus copallina. </T3>Hardin and Phillips (1985) documented the existenceof an intermediate form between <T3>Rhus galbra </T3>and <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>in at least two sites from which <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>had been reported. Much remains unknown about thedemographics and reproductive requirements of this species. Fire or someother suitable form of disturbance, such as mowing or careful clearing,is essential for maintaining the open habitat preferred by <T3>Rhus michauxii. </T3>Without such periodic disturbance, this type ofhabitat is gradually overtaken and eliminated by the shrubs and trees ofthe adjacent woodlands. As the woody species increase in height and density,they overtop the <T3>Rhus michauxii, </T3>which is shade-intolerant. The current distributionof the species is ample evidence of its dependence on disturbance. Of the16 remaining populations, 11 are on roadsides or in the edges of artificiallymaintained clearings. Two others are in areas that have been exposed toperiodic fire, another is in a natural opening on the rim of a Carolinabay (shallow, elliptical depression of unknown origin); the remaining twoare in wooded sites and are declining in vigor (J. Moore, personal communication,1988; T. Patrick, personal communication, 1988).The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> as endangered. With almost half of the species'populations already having been eliminated and only 16 remaining in existence(with most of these being very small in size and containing plants of onlyone sex), and based upon its dependence on some form of active management,it warrants protection under the Act. Endangered status seems appropriatebecause of the imminent serious threats facing most populations. As statedby Hardin and Phillips (1985), ``<T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is apparently on the verge of extinction * * *''Critical habitat is not being designated for the reasons discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat, at the time the species isdetermined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designationof critical habitat is not prudent for <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> at this time. As discussed under Factor B in the``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section, <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is vulnerable to taking, an activity difficultto enforce against and only regulated by the Act with respect to plantsin cases of (1) removal, reduction to possession from lands under Federaljurisdiction, or malicious damage or destruction; and (2) removal, cutting,digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation of any Statelaw or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Such provisionsare difficult to enforce, and publication of critical habitat descriptionswould make <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> more vulnerable and would increase enforcementproblems for the U.S. Department of Defense. The populations on privatelands would be vulnerable to collection and vandalism. Increased visitsto population locations stimulated by critical habitat designation couldadversely affect the species. The Federal and State agencies and landownersinvolved in protecting and managing the habitat of the species have beeninformed of the plant's locations and the importance of protection.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against collectionare discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to any critical habitat. Regulationsimplementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codifiedat 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to conferinformally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of a proposed species or result in the destructionor adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is subsequentlylisted, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activitiesthey authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its criticalhabitat. If a Federal action may adversely affect a listed species or itscritical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formalconsultation with the Service.The U.S. Department of Defense has jurisdiction over portions of this species'habitat. Federal activities that could impact <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> and its habitat in the future include, but arenot limited to, the following: Silvicultural activities, including timberharvesting and conversion of sites to pine plantations by means of mechanicalsite preparation; mechanized military training operations; recreationaldevelopment; power line construction and certain types of maintenance/improvements;highway construction and certain types of maintenance/improvements; andpermits for mineral exploration and mining. The Service will work withthe involved agencies to secure protection and proper management of <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> while accommodating agency activities to the extentpossible.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. With respect to <T3>Rhus michauxii,</T3> all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of theAct, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part,would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of theUnited States to import or export the species, transport it in interstateor foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, sell or offerit for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reducethe species to possession from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition,for listed plants the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibitthe malicious damage or destruction, on Federal lands and their removal,cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation ofany State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. It is expected that few trade permits wouldever be sought or issued, since <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington, DC 20038-7329 (202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3>;(2) The location of any additional populations of <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>and the reasons why any habitat should or shouldnot be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of theAct;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and the possibleimpacts on <T3>Rhus michauxii.</T3>Final promulgation of any regulation on <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>will take into consideration the comments and anyadditional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, Asheville Field Office (see <T2>``ADDRESSES'' </T2>section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Cooper, J., S.
