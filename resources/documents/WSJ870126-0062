Argyll, defeated by Guinness PLC in its bid for Distillers, denied, meanwhile, that it planned an offer for Guinness. But James Gulliver, chairman of the big food and drinks group, appeared to hold open the possibility of some combination with Guinness. There had been speculation that Argyll might make a hostile bid for Guinness after Guinness last week rebuffed its friendly overtures.    An Argyll statement said the company &quot;has no intention whatsoever&quot; of bidding for Guinness or any part of the troubled drinks group. But later Friday, Mr. Gulliver told reporters it was a &quot;fair inference&quot; that the company's statement didn't preclude other kinds of merger besides a takeover. These arrangements might include Guinness's absorbing Argyll in a restructured concern run by Argyll management, analysts suggested.    The sale of the British unit of Oakland, Calif.-based Safeway had been expected as a way to reduce the debt incurred in the 1986 leveraged buyout of the international grocery chain.    Safeway had been stalked last year by Dart Group of Landover, Md., which offered $64 a share, or $3.9 billion, for the grocery chain. Dart Group and the Haft family of Washington, which controls it, went to court to challenge Safeway's anti-takeover measures.    In July, Safeway agreed to be acquired by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in a leveraged buyout for $69 a share in cash and securities valued at a total $4.2 billion. The buyout was predicated on the sale of part of Safeway's assets, including its domestic real-estate and lucrative foreign operations, including the 120-store British chain.    Argyll's acquisition of British Safeway would about double its existing food-store business and create a group with annual sales of nearly $4.56 billion and net income of about $107 million, according to Argyll.    After acquiring Safeway's 132-store British chain, Argyll gradually would give the Safeway name to 160 of its biggest Presto stores, the company said, in the hope of benefiting from Safeway's relatively upscale image.    About 85% of Argyll's annual $2.90 billion in sales comes from its food division. The acquisition would make Argyll primarily a food-store business, the fourth largest supermarket concern in Britain, behind Sainsury PLC, Tesco PLC and Dee Corp., according to Argyll.    The transaction would be financed by an issue of 194 million new Argyll shares, raising $947 million. It also would be financed through a three-year, interest-free loan of $91.6 million from Safeway.    Existing Argyll holders would be able to buy a new share for every share they hold at a price of $4.88 apiece, Argyll said. Argyll shares rose 36.6 cents, to $5.57, Friday on the London Stock Exchange.    Argyll's acquisition of Safeway is subject to Argyll shareholder and regulatory approval. Although an Argyll-Safeway combination would hold about 9% of Britain's grocery store market, Argyll officials predicted government antitrust clearance. Dee Corp.'s acquisition of the Fine Fare store chain last year from Associated British Foods PLC, which gave Dee about 12% of the British market, was cleared by the government.    Argyll said that it may have lost an opportunity to become a major international drinks business because of its failed bid for Distillers last year. So, company officials hinted, Argyll may sell its drinks division. The division includes Barton Brands, the fourth biggest bourbon distiller in the U.S.    Last week, Guinness rebuffed Mr. Gulliver's offer of a &quot;friendly&quot; merger with Argyll. In a letter to Guinness Chairman Sir Norman Macfarlane, Mr. Gulliver said that such a merger was Argyll's &quot;primary interest.&quot; Guinness released the Argyll letter.    A merger apparently would provide a way for Guinness to avoid Argyll's threatened legal action against it that grew out of the fight over Distillers. Mr. Gulliver said Friday that any suit brought against Guinness would involve &quot;substantial&quot; claims and at least equal Argyll's bid costs of almost $84 million. Analysts have estimated that Argyll's claims could total several hundred million dollars.    Guinness is the subject of a government investigation to determine whether an illegal stock manipulation helped Guinness succeed in its $3.86 billion bid for Distillers.    ---   Grenfell Bank Chairman   LONDON -- Morgan Grenfell Group PLC said it appointed Sir Peter Carey chairman of its troubled Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co. unit as part of a restructuring of the merchant bank's management following recent high-level resignations.    Sir Peter, 63 years old and a member of the Morgan Grenfell holding company board since 1983, takes over from Charles Rawlinson, who has retired as chairman of the bank for health reasons. Mr. Rawlinson will now be vice chairman of the holding company.    Sir Peter's appointment follows the resignations last week of Christopher Reeves, deputy chairman and chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Group, and Graham Walsh, the head of corporate finance at the merchant bank. Sir Peter was formerly a senior civil servant in Britain's Department of Industry. Last week he emerged as one of the key figures in the bank when he was put in charge of an executive committee to manage its affairs in the wake of problems caused by the bank's involvement in the Guinness scandal.    Two of the merchant bank's directors, David Keys, 52 years old, and Jonathan Perry, 47 years old, were appointed to the holding company board in another move meant to strengthen its management. </TEXT></DOC>
