In addition, suchinsurance coverage would be separate from the insurance coverage providedfor any other accounts maintained by or for the settlor, trustee or beneficiariesin different rights and capacities at the same insured depository institution.However, if a beneficiary has interests in more than one trust accountestablished pursuant to trusts created by the same settlor then all ofthose interests would be aggregated and insured on a combined basis upto $100,000.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The recordkeeping requirements are enumerated at 12 CFR330.1(b). Most pension plans and other trusted employee benefit plans are treatedby the FDIC as irrevocable trusts and their funds, when deposited in anFDIC-insured bank, are insured according to the aforementioned rules governingthe insurance coverage for deposits of irrevocable trusts. In other words,the deposits of most pension and profit-sharing plans are entitled to ``pass-through''insurance and thus are insured in the amount of up to $100,000 per beneficiary,provided that the FDIC's recordkeeping requirements are satisfied. However,this ``pass-through'' insurance coverage is provided only when the valueof each participant's interest in the plan's accounts can be determinedwithout evaluation of any contingencies except for those contained in thepresent worth tables and rules of calculation for their use which are setforth in the Federal Estate Tax regulations. Thus, for example, while anemployee pension or profit-sharing plan would, in most cases, qualify forpass-through insurance coverage, a health and welfare plan generally wouldnot qualify for such coverage because in the case of a health and welfareplan, the present value of a participant's interest is contingent on anevent (i.e. illness or accident) that is not covered by the above-mentionedpresent worth tables. In addition, the FDIC has taken the position that deposit accounts establishedpursuant to a state or municipal deferred compensation plan which qualifiesunder section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 457 (a ``457Plan'') are not entitled to ``pass-through'' insurance coverage. Consequently,deposit accounts at FDIC-insured banks which are comprised of 457 Planfunds have been added together and insured in the amount of up to $100,000in the aggregate. By contrast, the former FSLIC insured 457 Plan depositaccounts at FSLIC-insured savings institutions in the amount of up to $100,000per participant pursuant to a specific regulation. 12 CFR 561.4(b). TheFDIC's position (of not providing pass-through insurance coverage for 457Plan deposits) has been based on the fact that, under section 457 of theInternal Revenue Code, the funds of 457 Plans are required to ``remain(until made available to the participant or other beneficiary) solely theproperty rights of the State. . . .'' 26 U.S.C. 457(b)(6). Since the State,rather than the employees, is deemed to be the sole owner of the fundsuntil they are distributed, the FDIC has maintained that the employees(participants) do not have any ownership interests in the funds upon whichinsurance coverage could be based and thus the funds cannot be insuredon a pass-through basis. Similarly, the FDIC has not been providing pass-through insurance coveragefor deposits maintained by unit investment trusts. An existing FDIC regulationwhich governs the deposit insurance provided for accounts established bycorporations (12 CFR 330.5(b)) provides that trusts which are registeredor subject to registration under section 8 of the Investment Company Actof 1940 (the ``40 Act'') shall be treated as corporations for the purposeof determining insurance coverage on the trust's accounts. Unit investmenttrusts are generally registered or subject to registration under the 40Act and thus have been treated as corporations for insurance purposes.Consequently, the FDIC has been adding together all of the deposits maintainedby a unit investment trust at the same FDIC-insured bank and has been insuringsuch deposits in the amount of up to $100,000 in the aggregate. The formerFSLIC did not have a comparable regulation governing the deposits of entitiesregistered or subject to registration under the 40 Act. The former FSLICtreated deposit accounts maintained by unit investment trusts at FSLIC-insuredsavings institutions as irrevocable trust accounts and insured them ona ``pass-through'' basis in the amount of up to $100,000 for the interestof each beneficiary of (investor in) such trusts. Section 220(b)(2) of the FIRRE Act mandates that, within six months ofthe date of enactment of the FIRRE Act, the FDIC must ``transmit to theCongress a report containing its findings and recommendations relatingto the pass-through of deposit insurance either to individual investorsin unit investment trust funds or to individual participants in pensionor profit sharing plans qualified under section 401 of the Internal RevenueCode of 1986.'' Moreover, section 220(b)(2) requires that the report containthe FDIC's ``assessment of the potential effects of broadening depositinsurance coverage on the safety of the insurance funds and the operationof capital markets.'' In conducting this study on ``pass-through'' insurance, the FDIC is interestedin receiving comments, suggestions and nay data or statistics relatingto the following issues: 1. The extent to which the FDIC should, as a matter of policy, providepass-through deposit insurance for deposits of unit investment trusts,pension plans, profit-sharing plans and other trusted employee benefitplans; 2. The effect of pass-through insurance coverage on the safety of the insurancefunds and the operation of capital markets; 3. The extent to which pass-through insurance coverage generally affectsthe liquidity of insured financial institutions; 4. The potential effects of expanding the existing insurance coverage toprovide pass-through insurance coverage for individual investors in unitinvestment trusts.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Washington, DC, this 13th day of November 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Hoyle L.
