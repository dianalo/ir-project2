Industry sources said that refiners engaged in contract talks with several OPEC members are taking less oil, as they hold out for price discounts. But sources added that the sudden decline in production may signal a serious new move toward production restraint by some Arab producers who were among the chief violators of OPEC's output quotas.    &quot;There is a determined intent -- even by Iraq -- to reduce production,&quot; said Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva-based firm highly regarded for its tracking of OPEC output. Among the cartel's 13 members, war-torn Iraq has been producing to greatest excess.    For whatever reason, OPEC's total production has dropped by more than one million barrels a day, or 6% to 7%, from December's daily average, according to most assessments, including Mr. Gerber's. And there are indications of a further decline.    Such shrinking in OPEC production could firm petroleum prices -- which were flat to slightly higher on spot and futures markets yesterday -- by offsetting such bearish fundamentals as world oil inventories, which are viewed as too high. Or, at least, it could limit further declines in oil prices, which are widely expected to reach a bottom of $14 or $15 a barrel in February or March.    However, at the moment, refiners can buy similar crudes on the spot market for $2 a barrel cheaper than officially-priced OPEC oil. Spot prices of the basket of crudes used to set OPEC's $18 benchmark currently average around $16 a barrel. Many oil analysts and crude traders still expect another drop of $1 to $2 a barrel in spot prices before spring. By then, the world's refiners will reduce operations by as much as two million barrels a day for seasonal factors, with a corresponding decline in demand for crude.    And, if recent activity in tanker chartering is a signal, production by OPEC's Persian Gulf members could rebound as quickly as it has fallen. &quot;Although activity turned down slightly since last week, charter fixtures for loading in the Middle East were running 70% over the prior four-week trend,&quot; said Robert Boslego, president of Boslego Corp., which analyzes oil markets.    But some industry experts said the OPEC members themselves are chartering tankers -- simply to use for storage -- so they can maintain relatively stable production levels even as export sales fall. OPEC's kingpin producer, Saudi Arabia, is believed to be building up its land storage of oil as well.    Although the Saudis are selling oil to their chief U.S. customers at market-related rather than at official prices, they have not, as previously reported, extended the same terms to Japanese companies. As a result, the Japanese have sharply reduced their purchases of Saudi oil.    Petro-Logistics estimated Saudi Arabia's sea-borne exports averaged only 2.3 million barrels a day during the first week of January. That would imply total production of 3.8 million barrels a day so far this month, which is in line with estimates by others. But that doesn't include the oil apparently going into storage.    Mr. Gerber said Petro-Logistics has been advised that the Saudis intend to maintain production at 4.1 million barrels a day for January. Such a level still would be below the kingdom's OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. Thus, it would be in keeping with a recent informal decision by the Gulf Cooperation Council -- or GCC, the policy-making group of the Persian Gulf region's Arab oil-producing states -- to restrain production voluntarily.    The Arab strategy, industry sources said, involves firming prices in the short term to counter pressures from non-Arab producers, including Iran, for a special OPEC meeting on pricing and output.    The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait -- two GCC members specificially cited within OPEC for prior &quot;cheating&quot; on their quotas -- already have surprised the industry. Neither is giving much in the way of price incentives so far.    Kuwait still is negotiating pricing terms with its important customers in Japan and did deliver a single cargo to the U.S. gulf coast this week at a spot price linked to that of Alaskan North Slope crude, according to the trader who purchased the cargo. And oil companies expect special pricing terms soon from Abu Dhabi, the chief Arab emirate.    Industry sources suggested that Mana Said Otaiba, oil minister of both Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates, appears, meanwhile, to be trying to &quot;talk up&quot; oil prices with many statements denying the existence of price-discount plans.    Iran and Iraq, warring for supremacy in the Persian Gulf as well as oil customers, are widely known to be offering market-related pricing. But Iraq's production has dropped by some 500,000 barrels a day to an average of 2.3 million barrels daily so far this month.    Estimates of total OPEC production vary widely, ranging between 16 million and 18 million barrels a day. But all the estimates are down sharply from those for December. Petro-Logistics places current production at 17.5 million barrels a day, down 1.2 million barrels a day from its estimate for December. </TEXT></DOC>
