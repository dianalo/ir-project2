 Mostorganizations have yet to consistently apply automated work managementsoftware to control the software development projects and maintenance tasksthat characterize their environments.andM;Where automated work management systems do exist, they are generally used toplan and track large, individual software development projects.andP;  Yet, studiesshow that 60% to 80% of all work performed within IS is spent on maintenance.andO;Maintenance activities remain largely outside the umbrella of automated workmanagement and project control.andP;  Few IS organizations, therefore, apply thesame standards of control to their own business units that they apply to thebusiness as a whole.andM;Under pressure to cut costs, boost productivity and manage expectations ofthe end-user community it serves, IS has significant cultural changes tomake.andP;  Few IS organizations consistently generate critical path schedulesmanually, let alone implement project management software to automate projectplanning and scheduling.andM;Relatively few IS organizations have implemented chargeback or projectaccounting systems designed to capture the organization's project costs.andO;Such systems would make project managers accountable to project sponsors;allow project sponsors to balance the costs of projects with their benefits;and enable management to evaluate return on IS investments.andM;Generally lacking within IS organizations is the means to consolidate andaggregate cost and resource information.andP;  Without an organization-wideframework that standardizes common measures for evaluating status andperformance, IS cannot possibly answer fundamental management questions.andM;Stop reading if you can easily derive answers to these questions:andM;* What is the planned versus actual schedule status of each project in ourorganization?andM;* How can we better meet the expectations of our end users?andM;* If a key project slips, what is the impact on other projects?andM;* How much development time is actually devoted to maintenance activities?andO;How much maintenance are we performing in major application areas?andM;* Which critical projects can be accomplished with the currently budgetedresources?andM;* How can we effectively redirect resources to satisfy key users and speeddelivery of critical systems?andM;* What are the implications of a 10% staff reduction on current projectschedules?andM;* Is the skill mix of resources in our organization appropriate?andM;For many firms, host-based time-reporting and cost-tracking software,budgeting systems, PC project management tools and spreadsheets all operateindependently.andP;  This poorly integrated collection of tools has created a webof inconsistent, fragmented reporting.andP;  Project data is frequentlyincompatible from one application to the next, making comparison and analysisbetween multiple projects difficult or impossible.andM;Decision support at the organizational level requires an automatedenvironment that consolidates information across the organization.andO;Consolidated reporting allows IS department managers, project managers andproject sponsors to see a comprehensive view of all IS work that pertains totheir respective areas.andM;Some organizations are beginning to address this &quot;big picture,&quot; bothstrategically and tactically.andP;  Tactically, they are implementing systems andprocedures to collect the necessary information.andP;  Strategically, they aremaking a corporate commitment to IS accountability.andM;Accountability means that IS managers are fiscally accountable to end-usersponsors of development and maintenance projects.andP;  Through accountability, ISmanagers will be challenged to improve productivity in development byutilizing Case and improved management control tools.andM;Why have integrated, automated work management tools been slow to take holdin an IS world that exists to automate through software?andP;  Simply stated, IShas not made their implementation a high priority.andM;IS still needs to recognize the gains in productivity that will come fromimproving management of its most significant resource: its people.andP;  Untilthen, IS--like the proverbial shoemaker's children--will travel down the roadwith bare feet.andM;Shattow is president of Boston-based Multitrak Software Development Corp.,andO;which provides management consulting services and project control tools formedium- to large-sized MIS organizations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
