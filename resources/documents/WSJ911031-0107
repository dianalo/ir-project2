The findings, by U.K. and U.S. teams, excite Alzheimer'sdisease researchers partly because the genetic glitchesinvolved occur in a gene previously suspected to play apivotal role in the disorder. The gene lies on chromosome 21,one of the 23 coiled strands of DNA found in human cells, andproduces a precursor of the so-called beta amyloid protein,whose precise function isn't known. However, deposits of thatprotein are formed in the brains of people with Alzheimer'sdisease, possibly triggering memory loss and other mentaldeterioration. An estimated four million Americans have thedisease.</LP><TEXT>   The gene defects are especially noteworthy because theyboth occur within the same tiny fragment of DNA within theamyloid gene, suggesting a malfunction in that fragment aloneis enough to set off a metabolic domino effect leading to thedisease. By focusing studies on the fragment, scientists maybe able to discover fairly quickly the biochemical chain ofevents that cause at least some cases of inheritedAlzheimer's disease. That, in turn, might suggest similarchains that cause the common &quot;sporadic&quot; form of the disease-- and, eventually, ways to arrest or prevent it.   The latest gene discovery, reported in today's issue ofthe journal Nature, was made by John Hardy and colleagues atSt. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London. Earlier thisyear, Dr. Hardy's team first reported evidence that a similargene mutation on chromosome 21 can cause inheritedAlzheimer's disease. The similar U.S. discovery of achromosome 21 defect was reported earlier this month in thejournal Science by Merrill Benson and colleagues at IndianaUniversity.   The gene mutations were found in families with multiplecases of inherited, &quot;early-onset&quot; Alzheimer's disease, whichcauses memory loss and other symptoms beginning around age 40-- the common, sporadic form of the disease typically isn'tapparent until after age 65. The Indiana study was based onthree generations of a single family and represents the firsttime a gene linked with Alzheimer's disease has been tracedthrough multiple generations.   While the latest findings underscore the probableimportance of the amyloid gene in Alzheimer's disease, theydon't show how defects in the gene can lead to the disease.To elucidate that, researchers are trying to incorporateversions of the recently discovered gene defects in mice.They hope such genetically engineered rodents will developamyloid deposits in their brains or show other telltale signsof Alzheimer's disease, providing an animal model to studyhow it unfolds.</TEXT></DOC>
