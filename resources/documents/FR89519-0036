The assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that thefield testing of these genetically engineered tomato plants will not presenta risk of introduction or dissemination of a plant pest and will not haveany significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based uponthis finding of no significant impact, the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService has determined that an environmental impact statement need notbe prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at BiotechnologyBiologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Dr. James White, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 844, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-7612.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Calgene, Inc., of Davis, California, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment, to field test genetically engineeredtomato plants modified to be tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tomato plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Calgene, Inc., application. APHIS concluded that the fieldtesting will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Calgene, Inc., as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding a modified 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosophoshikimate synthasethat is not inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate has been inserted intothe tomato chromosome. In nature, chromosomal genetic material can onlybe transferred to other sexually compatible plants by cross-pollination.In this field trial, the introduced gene cannot spread to other plantsby cross-pollination because the field test plot is sufficiently distantfrom any sexually compatible plants with which it might cross-pollinate.2. Neither the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosophoshikimate synthase gene itself,nor its gene product, confers on tomato plants any plant pest characteristics.Traits that lead to weediness in plants are polygenic traits and cannotbe conferred by adding a single gene.3. The micro-organism from which the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosophoshikimatesynthase gene was isolated is not a plant pest.4. The 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosophoshikimate synthase gene does not providethe transformed tomato plants with any measurable selective advantage overnontransformed tomato in the ability to be disseminated or to become establishedin the environment.5. The vector used to transfer the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosophoshikimate synthasegene to tomato plants has been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment,and does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, althoughderived from a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant disease have beenremoved from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to be nonpathogenicto plants.6. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA and the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosophoshikimate synthase gene into the plantcell, has been shown to be eliminated and no longer associated with thetransformed tomato plants.7. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).The vector does not survive in the plants.8. Glyphosate is one of the new herbicides that is rapidly degraded inthe environment. It has been shown to be less toxic to animals than manyherbicides commonly used.9. The field test site is very small (135 feet wide by 220 feet long) andphysically isolated by a chain-link fence and a surrounding area of cultivatedland.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelinesfor Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 15th day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
