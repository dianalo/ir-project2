Sakharov is running for one of the seats in the new Sovietparliament reserved for the Academy of Sciences. He and otherreformist candidates at Wednesday's election meeting criticized anew decree on dissent and authorities for the deaths of 20protesters in a clash in Soviet Georgia.   The scientist who followed the human rights activist to thepodium at Moscow State University, however, was the one whoelectrified the hall.   The elderly man, who identified himself only as Vonsovsky, saidhe was ashamed to admit that he signed a letter to the SovietPresidium denouncing Sakharov after the physicist criticized theSoviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979.   ``I committed a very bad act,'' Vonsovsky said in front ofhundreds of top Soviet scientists. ``I am offering a profoundapology.''   ``I would like to say that Sakharov is our honor, our pride, andour conscience,'' Vonsovsky said.   The Presidium cited such letters when it stripped Sakharov ofhis numerous awards and accused him of subversion in early 1980. Hewas exiled from Moscow to the provincial city of Gorky. In 1986, hewas freed when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power andbegan releasing dissidents.   The academy is scheduled to vote Thursday to fill the 12 of its20 seats in the Congress of People's Deputies that were left emptyafter its first round of voting last month.   In his speech, Sakharov said an April 8 decree barring ``insultsand discrediting'' of the government should be rescinded. He alsocriticized laws that allow authorities to use special troops toclear demonstrations.   Critics charge that by banning statements that discredit Sovietofficials, the new decree threatens citizens with prison or finesfor speaking the truth about officials who do their jobs poorly.   Sakharov also blamed the April 9 tragedy in Tbilisi, the capitalof Soviet Georgia, on such laws and on forces opposing perestroika,Gorbachev's drive to restructure Soviet society.   Hundreds of academy members voted to support a resolution of itsbranch in Georgia that termed the April 9 clash an ``unprecedentedmassive beating of innocent people.''   At least 20 people died when soldiers moved into a crowd ofdemonstrators on Tbilisi's main street. A commission isinvestigating charges that soldiers used poison gas, shovels andclubs.   The academy holds 20 seats in the Congress of People's Deputiesthat will meet for the first time on May 25.   Of the congress' 2,250 seats, 750 will be held by memberselected from the Communist Party and its affiliates, trade unions,social and professional organizations like the Academy of Sciences.   Elections in 1,500 geographical districts were held March 26.   Sakharov's supporters organized a campaign against the 23candidates chosen by the academy's election commission for the 20seats and in voting last month succeeded in preventing 15 of themfrom getting 50 percent of the vote.   The academy was required to organize a second election, and lastweek Sakharov was chosen to be among the 28 nominees.</TEXT></DOC>
