Today, USEPA is proposing to also disapprove the enforcement programin the vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) portion of Indiana's Ozoneplan for Lake and Porter Counties, the I/M enforcement program in Indiana'scarbon monoxide (CO) plan for the CO nonattainment area in Lake County,and the overall CO SIP for the nonattainment area in Lake County (USEPAwill address the I/M portion of Indiana's Ozone plan for Clark and FloydCounties in future <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice(s).) It is retaining its July 14, 1987(52 FR 26404) proposed approval of the remainder of Indiana's I/M program.Based on its proposed disapproval of the enforcement portion of the I/Mprogram, USEPA is proposing to limit certain Federal highway, air quality,and sewage treatment funding assistance for Lake and Porter Counties andto impose in these same Counties under Section 173(4) of the Clean AirAct (Act), a volatile organic compound (VOC) major stationary source constructionmoratorium for failure to implement the I/M program as part of the 1979Ozone SIP, and a CO major stationary source construction moratorium inthe nonattainment area of Lake County for failure to implement the 1979CO SIP. In addition, pursuant to Section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Act, USEPAis proposing to impose a ban on the construction of major sources of COin the Lake County CO nonattainment area. (This construction ban has alreadybeen imposed in Lake and Porter Counties for major VOC sources.) USEPA'sproposed actions today are based on Indiana's failure to submit an adequatepermanent I/M enforcement program as part of its 1982 Ozone and CO SIP(Ozone/CO SIP) submittals for the respective counties.The funding limitations apply to Federal funds provided under the CleanAir Act (Act) and Title 23 of the United States Code. The USEPA is reproposingto impose Federal funding and construction restrictions pursuant to sections176(a), 176(b), and 173(4), of the Act.

Congress required Statesto revise their SIPs to provide for attainment of the standards by December31, 1982, and to submit the revised plans to USEPA by January 1, 1979.For areas with serious ozone or carbon monoxide (CO) problems where theStates demonstrated they were unable to attain these standards by the endof 1982, even with the implementation of all reasonably available measures,Congress allowed an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987(section 172(a)(2)).In return for this extension, the Act requires States to submit additionalair pollution control measures in their 1979 ozone/CO SIP revisions (section172(b)(11)). One such additional measure was a schedule for implementationof an I/M program, which included certification that the State and localgovernments had the legal authority to implement and enforce the program(sections 110(a)(2)(f), 172(b)(10), and 172(b)(11)(B)).The State of Indiana requested an extension of the ozone attainment deadlineto 1987 for Clark, Floyd, Lake and Porter Counties, and for carbon monoxidefor a subportion of Lake County. USEPA approved the request on February11, 1982 (47 FR 6274). Therefore, the Act requires Indiana to implementan I/M program in these counties.On January 2, 1981 (46 FR 96), USEPA conditionally approved the revised1979 Indiana ozone/CO SIP, including the State's commitment to implementI/M. The Indiana SIP included certification that the State had legal authorityto implement and enforce an I/M program, and also contained a schedulefor the completion of all actions necessary to implement the program byJanuary 1, 1983. However, USEPA required the State, as part of the conditionalapproval, to submit a detailed description of its enforcement mechanism,including procedures, penalties, letters of commitment from responsibleenforcement agencies, and other elements required in USEPA's I/M policy(see January 19, 1981 memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Administratorfor Mobile Source Air Pollution Control to the Air and Hazardous MaterialsDivision Directors, Region I-X; September 24, 1980; memorandum from theAssistant Administrator, Office of Air, Noise, and Radiation, to the RegionalAdministrator, Regions I-X; February 21, 1979; memorandum from the AssistantAdministrator for Air, Noise, and Radiation, to the Regional Administrators,I-X; July 17, 1978; memorandum from the Assistant Administrator for Airand Waste Management to the Regional Administrators, Regions I-X; and theJanuary 22, 1981, <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 46 FR 7182).Indiana submitted its draft 1982 revisions to its ozone/CO SIP on September2, 1982. If adopted, this plan would have formally withdrawn the 1979 commitmentto implement an I/M program. The plan additionally stated that a new I/Mprogram would not be readopted unless attainment would not otherwise occurby December 31, 1987, as indicated by future air quality data.In a letter dated November 10, 1982, USEPA provided its evaluation of andcomments on Indiana's September 2, 1982, submittal. In the letter, USEPAstated that the I/M portion of Indiana's September 2, 1982, plan did notcontain the various elements required under USEPA's 1982 SIP policy, inthat there were no commitments to implement I/M by December 31, 1982, andno rules and regulations for I/M were included.On February 3, 1983 (48 FR 5106), USEPA proposed to disapprove the I/Mportion of the 1982 Indiana ozone/CO SIP for these same reasons. On March22, 1983, USEPA notified affected Federal, State, and local agencies, thatthe USEPA/Department of Transportation (DOT) procedures for imposing fundinglimitations under section 176(a) were being initiated. This notificationstarted a 30-day consultation period in accordance with these procedures.To ensure that Federal funds do not further contribute to the already seriousair pollution problem and to encourage state cooperation, Congress adoptedsection 176(a) of the Act. Section 176(a) of the Act requires withholdingof certain Federal assistance funds for highway construction and air qualityprograms, if the USEPA Administrator finds that a State has failed to submit,or to make reasonable efforts to submit, a SIP which considers each ofthe elements of section 172 of the Act, including the requirement for I/M.On April 10, 1980, after prior notice and public comment, USEPA and theDepartment of Transportation published their final policies and proceduresfor imposing funding restrictions under section 176(a) (45 FR 24692). On August 3, 1983, USEPA proposed air quality funding restrictions anda construction moratorium under sections 176(b) and 173(4) of the Act forthe State's failure to implement the approved 1979 Indiana ozone/CO SIP,in particular, the I/M commitment USEPA had approved and incorporated intothe State's 1979 SIP (48 FR 35316). Subsequently, the State of Indiana renewed its commitment to implementan I/M program and adopted Indiana rule 325 IAC 13.1-1, Motor Vehicle Inspectionand Maintenance Requirements. A contract was established with Indiana VocationalTechnical College to conduct the testing program. The program began inspectingvehicles on May 31, 1984. Throughout the development period, USEPA soughta detailed description of the I/M endorcement mechanism for review priorto the start of testing. The State explored several possible mechanisms,but failed to adopt any of them. Indiana submitted its final 1982 zone/COSIP on December 2, 1983, and this SIP addressed I/M. However, the SIP lackedthe required detailed I/M enforcement description. USEPA documented itsconcern regarding the I/M program in a memorandum dated January 23, 1984,which was forwarded to the State, as well as in direct correspondence tothe State on September 28, 1984, and December 21, 1984. Additionally, USEPApublished a revised Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 9, 1984 (49 FR 39574) addressing thisissue. A Technical Support Document dated June 29, 1984, in support ofthe October 9, 1984, NPR extensively reviewed these issues. Besides addressing I/M deficiencies, the October 9, 1984, NPR also proposedto approve Indiana's CO SIP for the nonattainment area of Lake County becausethe State's plan provided for an emissions reduction of over 50% from 1980to 1987, which would result in NAAQS attainment in the nonattainment areaby 1987.On February 6, 1985, Governor Robert D. Orr proposed to enforce the I/Mprogram by establishing a $100 fine to be shared evenly by the State andthe local law enforcement agency issuing the citation. The Governor alsoproposed a one-time $5 vehicle excise tax credit to the owners of testedvehicles. The State included these two I/M enforcement elements in itsFebruary 8, 1985, official response to the October 9, 1984, NPR. The Statealso indicated its intention to pursue vehicle registration suspensionfor noncomplying vehicles.On March 13, 1985, USEPA informed Governor Orr that the proposed July 1986implementation of the shared fine was unacceptable since it potentiallyallowed violators to avoid compliance for longer than two years. USEPAindicated that a registration suspension of denial system would be moreeffective; however, USEPA acknowledged that such a program could not bestarted before January 1986. Therefore, USEPA informed the Governor thatan interim enforcement mechanism was necessary to increase compliance untilthe State established a permanent means of enforcement. USEPA subsequentlynotified the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on April 15, 1985, thatthe 30-day consultation period under Section 176(a) procedures was beingreinitiated for the State of Indiana (45 FR 24692). A meeting was held on May 9, 1985, between USEPA, FHWA, and the State todiscuss the Federal highway funding restriction process and any actionby the State to satisfactorily resolve the problem. At the conclusion ofthe meeting USEPA informed FHWA and the State that USEPA must continueits projected schedule to impose restrictions, due to the lack of concreteaction by the State to immediately begin enforcement of the I/M program.Because the State failed to submit a detailed description of an enforcementmechanism, USEPA proposed on January 21, 1986, (see 51 FR 2732) to disapprovethe I/M portion of the ozone/CO SIP and to impose Federal funding restrictionson Clark, Floyd, Lake, and Porter Counties, pursuant to section 176(a)of the Act. On March 7, 1986, Governor Orr signed legislation authorizing suspensionof registration of non-complying vehicles. On April 7, 1986, (51 FR 11756),further action to limit Federal funding assistance and to impose the constructionmoratorium was indefinitely postponed because the State enacted the suspensionof registration authorizing legislation.A letter was sent to Indiana by USEPA on September 24, 1986, informingthe State that it was acceptable to begin enforcement of the I/M programagainst non-compliers beginning with the then-current test cycle, whichcommenced on March 1, 1986. Accordingly, the Indiana Department of EnvironmentalManagement (IDEM) targeted December 15, 1986, as the date to send out thefirst non-compliance notices. Since then, the two agencies responsiblefor sending out the warning notices (IDEM) and the suspension notices (theBureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV)), have fallen increasingly behind the noticeschedule.According to the State's calculations, the overall compliance rate forthe second cycle of the program was 67.6%, and the State had only suspended38 vehicle registrations.On January 26, 1987, USEPA reproposed to approve Indiana's attainment demonstrationfor the CO nonattainment area in Lake County based on an eatimated 35%emission reduction from 1981 to 1987 provided by the Federal Motor VehicleControl Program through pollution controls on late-model vehicles. Availablemonitoring data showed that a CO emission reduction of 10% from 1981 levelswas necessary to achieve the NAAQS by 1987. (Because of the deficienciesin the I/M program discussed below, however, USEPA today is reproposingto disapprove the CO SIP for the nonattainment area of Lake County.)On July 14, 1987, (52 FR 26404), USEPA proposed to disapprove the Indiana1982 ozone plan as not meeting all the requirements of Part D.\1\<NOTE/> This notice included a proposed disapproval of that portionof the I/M program which addresses funding and resources for enforcement,because of a failure by the State to provide funding for program enforcement.USEPA further proposed to approve all other portions of the I/M programbecause the State's submittal of September 30, 1986, and February 18, 1987,addressed the outstanding issues cited in the October 9, 1984, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The State had not, however, adequately addressedfunding and resources for enforcement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\USEPA disapproved Indiana's overall Part D ozone plan forLake and Porter Counties on November 18, 1988 (53 FR 46608). It will takeaction on the Clark and Floyd Counties plan in future <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice(s).On August 12, 1987, USEPA notified Indiana Governor Orr that because ofthe lack of an effective enforcement program, low compliance rate, andlack of program funding, USEPA was beginning the process to impose Federalhighway and air quality funding restrictions, to impose a constructionmoratorium, and to initiate the 30-day consultation period as specifiedin the previously cited April 10, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The 30-day consultation period was initiatedin a letter dated August 12, 1987, to the Regional Administrator of theFHWA.In a letter dated September 8, 1987, Governor Orr indicated that approximately$56,000 in new funds were being provided for the enforcement effort, andthat IDEM and BMV had agreed to a new streamlined enforcement process.At Indiana's request, on September 11, 1987, the USEPA met with representativesof IDEM and the FHWA to discuss the reasons why USEPA was pursuing Federalfunding and construction restrictions. USEPA representatives explainedthat, while the State's efforts are important steps towards enforcing theEmission Testing Program, USEPA will proceed to impose Federal highwayand air quality funds, as well as a major stationary source constructionmoratorium, because the State's efforts, by themselves, do not assure thatthe suspension of registrations for noncomplying vehicles will be routineand expeditious, and that a sufficiently high level of compliance willbe achieved and maintained.In a December 23, 1987, letter to the Regional Administrator, GovernorOrr informed USEPA that an additional $258,000 was being made availableto enforce the program. In a response dated January 15, 1988, USEPA informedGovernor Orr that while additional funding has been provided, the Statemust demonstrate that enforcement will be routine and expeditious.Compliance and enforcement statistics from the first two cycles (May 1984to December 1987) demonstrates that the State has failed to implement anenforcement program. Only 38 registrations have been suspended over thefour years and each cycle has had in excess of 100,000 non-compliers. Further,even though significant amounts of additional funds for enforcement havebeen provided, no other enforcement action of a routine and expeditiousnature has occurred.USEPA believes that the State of Indiana (1) has failed to implement theI/M program approved as part of the 1979 Ozone/CO SIP in Lake and PorterCounties and (2) has also failed to submit an adequate enforcement mechanismas part of the 1982 Ozone/CO SIP. While it appeared that the September30, 1986, enforcement mechanism was approvable, USEPA has concluded thatthe enforcement mechanism is not approvable because it has not met USEPA'srequirement that violations are cited and prosecuted as routinely and expeditiouslyas are vehicle registration violations. (See January 19, 1981, policy memorandafrom the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Mobile Source Air PollutionControl to Air and Hazardous Materials Division Directors, Regions I-X).The State had initially pointed to the fact that insufficient resourceswas the reason registration suspensions did not occur in a routine andexpeditious manner. However, even after additional resources were providedsuspensions have not occurred. USEPA concludes that the enforcement mechanismestablished by the State is not workable due to systemic problems particularto the State of Indiana.Prior to a vehicle's registration being suspended seven distinct stepsmust take place. The steps include: (1) An initial notice; (2) a determinationof noncompliance after notices are returned; (3) IDEM notifies BMV by computertape of violators; (4) BMV sends notices of registration suspensions andprovides a listing of notices mailed to IDEM; (5) responses to noticesof registration suspensions are returned to BMV by citizens; (6) BMV givesnotices to IDEM after sorting into two categories; (7) IDEM determinesand notifies BMV by computer tape of noncompliance after processing thenotices provided by BMV; and, 8) BMV suspends registrations. Additionalsteps are required if a citizen requests an administrative hearing.This process has proved to be cumbersome and lengthy and has not resultedin routine and expeditious enforcement. Even with additional enforcementresources, the enforcement process has not became routine and expeditious.USEPA believes that the Indiana process cannot be routine and expeditiousdue to the following process characteristics: the large amounts of informationthat must be transferred between two State agencies; the assignment ofcomparable priority to the enforcement action by two State agencies; thenecessary sorting and processing that each State agency must perform; andthe quality control checks to ensure that the State does not inadvertentlysuspend the registration of a citizen who ultimately came into compliance.Therefore, the State has failed to submit an enforcement mechanism thatresults in routine and expeditious enforcement. Consequently, the Statedid not submit an enforcement mechanism that can be approved by USEPA asmeeting the Ozone/CO SIP approval criteria.<ITAG tagnum="84">Clark and Floyd Counties</ITAG>This proposed rulemaking does not apply to Clark and Floyd Counties. Overthe past few months local law enforcement officials in Clark and FloydCounties have initiated a local enforcement program consisting of issuingcitations to motorists not displaying a valid windshield sticker. Roadblockshave also been set up to check vehicles for valid windshield stickers.When a citation is issued the violator(s) must appear in court and is subjectto a minimum $100.00 fine. In a March 1985 letter to Governor Orr, the Governor was informed that,``If the State is to avoid the imposition of Federal construction and fundingrestrictions, State and Local law enforcement agencies need to * * * aggressivelyissue citations for I/M noncompliance * * *''. The Governor was furtherinformed that an interim enforcement mechanism was necessary to increasecompliance until the State established a permanent means of enforcement.Clark and Floyd Counties are not included in this proposal because locallaw enforcement officials are aggressively pursuing enforcement throughan interim enforcement mechanism. However, for Federal funding and constructionrestrictions to be ultimately avoided by Clark and Floyd Counties, theState must establish a permanent means of enforcement. If the State failsto do this, then Federal restrictions will be imposed in Clark and FloydCounties in addition to those proposed in Lake and Porter Counties. WereLake and Porter Counties to initiate a similar sticker enforcement effort,USEPA would continue to view it as an interim measure and would only delaythe imposition of sanctions in response to State establishment of a permanent,approvable mechanism. USEPA will rulemake on Indiana's ozone plan, includingI/M and any possible sanctions, for Clark and Floyd Counties in future<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice(s).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Findings </ITAG>On July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26404), USEPA proposed to find that the State ofIndiana failed to appropriate adequate resources and funding for enforcementand oversight of the I/M program portion of the 1982 Ozone/CO SIP as requiredby section 172(b)(7) of the Act. Adequate resources and funding have beenprovided, but the State continues to experience serious problems with enforcement.The State has only suspended 38 vehicle registrations while tens of thousandsof vehicles are not in compliance with program requirements. USEPA is proposingto disapprove Indiana's enforcement program in Lake and Porter Countiesbecause it does not meet USEPA policy requirements that enforcement beas routine and expeditious as are vehicle registration violations. Consequently,USEPA, is:1. Proposing to find that the State has failed to implement the I/M programapproved as part of its 1979 Ozone/CO SIP in Lake and Porter Counties.2. Re-proposing to impose the construction moratorium under section 173(4)and re-proposing to impose the air quality funding restrictions under 176(b)in Lake and Porter Counties for the State's failure to implement its approved1979 Ozone/CO SIP. The construction moratorium is for the construction of major sources ofvolatile organic compound emissions and the major modification of suchexisting major sources in Lake and Porter Counties, and the constructionof new major sources and the major modification of such CO sources in thenonattainment area of Lake County. 3. Retaining its July 14, 1987, proposed approval of all elements of Indiana's1982 I/M program, except for the enforcement program. 4. Proposing to find that the State has failed to submit an adequate enforcementprogram as part of its 1982 Ozone/CO SIP.5. Proposing to disapprove the CO SIP for the nonattainment area of LakeCounty for the failure to submit an adequate I/M enforcement progam aspart of its 1982 CO SIP.6. Proposing to impose a construction ban for major new CO sources andmajor modifications of existing CO sources in the CO nonattainment areain Lake County, as required by section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Act. (This constructionban was imposed on December 18, 1988, in Lake and Porter Counties for majorVOC sources. See USEPA's November 18, 1988, ozone plan disapproval notice.)7. Re-proposing to impose the Federal highway and air quality funding restrictionsin Lake and Porter Counties, under Section 176(a), for the State's failureto submit or to make reasonable efforts to submit an adequate 1982 Ozone/COSIP revision.8. Proposing to impose the section 316(b) sewage treatment funding restrictionsin Lake and Porter Counties for the State's failure to implement the approved1979 Ozone/CO SIP, and for failure to submit an approvable 1982 Ozone/COSIP.During the public comment period, USEPA will consider any comments on thisissue. If Indiana fails to remedy this situation before USEPA takes finalaction, the resulting funding limitations and construction restrictionspursuant to sections 110(a)(2)(I), 176(a), 176(b), 173(4), and 316(b) willbecome effective 30 days after the final rulemaking is published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. Upon the effective date of the final rulemaking,the Secretary of Transportation will not approve any projects nor awardany grants in Lake and Porter Counties, under Title 23 of the United StatesCode, except for safety, mass transit, or transportation improvement projectsrelated to air quality improvement or maintenance.On August 3, 1983, USEPA discussed the formulas for withholding Clean AirAct Section 105 air pollution control funds if that became necessary forany particular State (48 FR 35312). The formula USEPA proposed as the preferredformula, would add all Clean Air Act funds which would normally be awardedto all levels of government in the State, and would withhold from thattotal a percentage which is equal to the percentage of the State's populationresiding in the nonimplementation I/M urbanized areas. Direct grants madeto local government agencies responsible for I/M implementation would beaffected first, with any remaining restrictions to be applied against Statefunds. If the State is the only level of government responsible for I/Mimplementation, which USEPA believes is the case for Lake and Porter Counties,USEPA would subtract from the amount to be withheld from the State anyfunds that are granted directly to local government agencies in the urbanizedareas, because USEPA believes these local funds are exempt from the fundingrestrictions. This is the formula which will be used for Indiana. The U.S.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld this approach in <T3>New Mexico Environmental Improvement v. Thomas, </T3>789 F.2d 825 (10thCir. 1986).In the August 11, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(45 FR 53382), USEPA published its policy andprocedures for implementing the municipal wastewater treatment works constructiongrants limitations provided in section 316 of the CAA. Section 316 allowsthe Administrator of USEPA to withhold, condition or restrict grants forconstruction of sewage treatment works under the following situation: (1)Where the treatment works will not comply with new source performance standardsor with National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; (2) wherethe State is not carrying out the SIP or there is not an USEPA approvedSIP that provides for the increase of each pollutant that is reasonablyanticipated to result either directly or indirectly from proposed new sewagetreatment construction; (3) where construction of the proposed treatmentworks will create new sewage treatment capacity that may reasonably beanticipated to cause or contribute to, directly or indirectly, an increasein emissions of any pollutant in excess of the increase provided for underthe SIP; (4) where the proposed new sewage treatment capacity will otherwisenot be in conformity with the SIP; and, (5) where the increased emissionsassociated with the proposed new sewage treatment capacity will interferewith, or be inconsistent with the SIP for any other State. The reader shouldrefer to the August 11, 1980, <T4>Federal Register </T4>in conjunction with today's proposal.It is noted that because of the period of time since the above policy andprocedures were first published and because of changes in USEPA's constructiongrants program, USEPA is giving consideration to revising the policy toupdate it. Any such revisions will be the subject of a future <T4>Federal Register</T4>. However, the current policy will remain in effectuntil any new policy is published.USEPA solicits comments on what action the State would have to take beforeUSEPA should lift these restrictions, if it is the Agency's final decisionto impose these restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Opportunity for Public Hearing</ITAG>USEPA is announcing a public hearing on its proposed actions regardingFederal funding and construction restrictions for Lake and Porter Counties.The hearing will be held on April 13, 1989 at 10:30 am, County CommissionersCourtroom, Board of Commissioners of Lake County, 2293 North Main Street,Crown Point, Indiana 46307.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Public Comment</ITAG>Interested parties are invited to comment on all aspects of the proposedfindings including USEPA's proposed action to impose Federal funding andconstruction restrictions. USEPA will consider all testimony received atthe public hearing. Additionally, USEPA will keep the public comment periodopen until 30 days after the last public hearing date to provide an opportunityfor submission or rebuttal information and supplementary information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 <T3>et seq.</T3>, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysisassessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. Under5 U.S.C. 605(6), this requirement may be waived if the Agency certifiesthat the rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, smallnot-for-profit enterprises, and governmental entities with jurisdictionover populations of less than 50,000. If USEPA takes final action, a moratorium on construction and modificationof major stationary sources of the pollutant for which an attainment extensionwas granted for a specific area will go into effect. A major stationarysource for this purpose is any source which emits, or has the potentialto emit, 100 tons per year or more of the relevant pollutant (see 40 CFR52.24(f)(4) (1986)). The moratorium would also prohibit major modifications,which are physical changes in the operation of a source that would resultin a significant net increase of a pollutant. (See 40 CFR 52.24(f)(5) (1986).)Thus, some small entities might be affected by final Agency action. USEPA has, in the past, made efforts to quantify the impact of the Actrules on the construction and modification of sources, but has been unableto do so. USEPA's lack of success is due, in part, to the need to obtaininformation on future plans for business growth. This information is difficultto obtain, as businesses are understandably reluctant to make their planspublic. Consequently, USEPA is making no quantified assessment of the potentialeconomic impact on small entities from today's proposal. Although USEPA believes that a final action to impose the constructionrestrictions might have some impact on small entities, this impact cannotaffect the Agency's actions. Under the Clean Air Act, the imposition ofthe construction moratorium is automatic and mandatory whenever the Agencydetermines that an approved or promulgated SIP is not being implementedin a nonattainment area. Final action on today's proposal also could result in withholding of portionsof air pollution control funds, provided for under Section 105 of the Act,from certain areas in Indiana. However, since today's proposal does notaffect any areas with populations of less than 50,000, the governmentalentities affected by any funding limitations do not fall within the definitionof ``small entities''. If USEPA takes final action and finds that the State has failed to submit,and is not making reasonable efforts to submit, a SIP that considers eachof the elements required by Section 172, certain highway construction fundsunder Title 23 of the United States Code, and air quality planning fundsunder the Clean Air Act, and certain sewage treatment plant funds willbe withheld. Thus, some small entities probably will be affected by finalUSEPA action. USEPA cannot predict reliably the impact of Clean Air Act restrictionsunder Section 176(a) because of the exemptions authorized for highway andair quality planning projects. Careful review and evaluation of each projectis necessary to determine whether or not a project is exempt. Consequently,USEPA is making no quantified assessment of the potential economic impacton small entities that may result from today's proposal. While a final action to impose Federal highway and air quality fundingrestrictions might have some impact on small entities this impact cannotaffect the Agency actions under the Act because the imposition of Section176(a) funding restrictions are automatic and mandatory whenever the Agencydetermines that a State has failed to submit or made reasonable effortsto submit a SIP which addresses each of the elements of Section 172, Similarly,USEPA can not reliably predict the impact of the Clean Water Act restrictionsunder Section 316(b), because growth projections specifically related toimpact projects are not available. However, the Agency believes that thenumber of small entities (cities and towns) affected by these restrictionswill not be substantial. Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major''. It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmentalrelations, Ozone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 11, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank M.
