The airplane swooped less than 200 feet over the heads of the90,000 fans at Roundhay Park on Monday night, the authority said.   ``Magistrates and courts take low-flying offenses veryseriously, and so do we,'' said a spokesman, speaking anonymouslyin keeping with British custom. ``It is our firm policy toprosecute.''   Under Civil Aviation Authority rules, it is an offense for apilot to fly below 3,000 feet over an event with more than 1,000spectators without permission.   Concert fans said they could read the twin-engine lightaircraft's registration number, and police have passed it on to theaviation authority.   ``It was sufficiently low for us to be concerned and reporthim,'' said a spokesman for West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police,also speaking of condition of anonymity. ``It is being consideredas a potential hazard.''   The pilot, if convicted, could face stiff fines and permanentloss of his pilot's license.   The audience sang ``Happy Birthday'' to Jackson during theconcert. A spokesman for the singer said Jackson is a Jehovah'sWitness and they do not celebrate birthdays, so there was nofanfare, gifts, cake or party planned.</TEXT></DOC>
