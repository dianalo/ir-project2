As a result, the outlook for the Japanese financialindustry, which has already had a full share of grim reportslately, remains bleak.</LP><TEXT>   Late last week, anxiety was rife that the expiration ofstock-futures contracts on Friday would lead to a hugesell-off of stocks. While such worries are familiar to, andlargely discounted by, anyone who traded in the U.S. marketsin the late 1980s, they have yet to be allayed in Japan.Futures trading dominates activity here like in no othermajor market, and such derivitive products aren't wellunderstood by many players.   As on all previous expiration days, the expected panicdidn't happen. The Nikkei 225-stock average on Friday dropped105.82 points to 20456.06, after briefly falling below a17-month low earlier in the day. Despite fears that theNikkei could plunge 1,000 points or so at the Friday futuresexpiration, the Thursday and Friday sessions ended down atotal of only 136.08 points.   So much for the good news. The bad news: The marketcontinues its slow crawl downward, and many Japanese analystsbelieve it hasn't hit bottom yet. Even optimists' forecastshave a pessimistic tone.   &quot;The change of sentiment, when it comes, will be all tothe bullish side, because it's so bearish now,&quot; said CraigChudler, strategist at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew InternationalLtd., who expects the market to gain as much as 20% byDecember.   On Monday, the Nikkei index fell 397.74 points to closethe morning session at 20058.32.   Continuing talk of another cut in Japan's officialdiscount rate, as well as Friday's passage of a 72.22trillion-yen ($538.18 billion) budget for the fiscal yearbeginning April 1 by the Lower House of Japan's Diet, orparliament, had little supportive effect on Friday's market.   Passage of the budget will enable the government to speedup spending on public works projects and stimulate Japan'sstagnating economy. But many analysts said the budget doesn'thave enough oomph to turn Japan around.   &quot;Politically, it's some help&quot; to a market that is worriedabout the strength of the scandal-beset government of PrimeMinister Kiichi Miyazawa, said Masanobu Takahashi, directorof corporate research at Sanyo Investment Research Ltd.   &quot;But the budget isn't strong enough,&quot; Mr. Takahashi said.&quot;Most major manufacturers are still suffering from hugeinventory pileup.&quot; His firm predicts overall profits ofJapanese companies will fall 17.6% in the year ending March31, and to drop an additional 8.2% in the following fiscalyear.   A supplementary budget, with specific stimulatorymeasures, is expected from the government, but it remainsdoubtful whether that budget can be passed before Upper Houseelections in July.   The rate cut is expected within the next several weeks,despite the central bank chief's firm stance that the economyis going through an adjustment phase after years of rapidgrowth and that the central bank is monitoring effects ofprior rate cuts. The discount rate, which was last cut onDec. 30, stands at 4.5%, and political and business leadershave called for a cut of at least another one-half percentagepoint.   Friday's Nikkei close was the lowest since Oct. 1, 1990,when 20221.86 marked the bottom of Japan's 1990 stock crash.The market touched below that low on an intraday levelFriday, reaching 20168.15, before springing back up.Declining issues outnumbered gaining issues 648-315. TheTokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first sectionissues, declined 8.21 points to 1464.00.   But the market is so bearish that few took note of theNikkei's new low. The broader Topix index is already at 1986levels, because of a plunge in the share prices of Japan'sregional banks.   &quot;We think {the Nikkei average} is near the bottom, but wecould test sub-20000 levels,&quot; said Kathy Matsui, investmentstrategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan.)   Trading volumes remain poor, thus commission revenues atJapanese securities houses still dwindle. Volume, whichtotaled 297 million shares Thursday, rose Friday to anestimated 650 million contracts, but that was only because ofadjustments with the futures contract. Since Dec. 13, thelast time volume was that high -- it too was a futuresexpiration day -- trading volume in the Tokyo market hastopped 300 million shares just twice, while Japanese brokersconsider 500 million the minimum needed for profitability.   &quot;Nomura {Securities Co.} and Kokusai {Securities Co.} willshow a profit this year,&quot; Mr. Takahashi of Sanyo Investmentsaid, predicting that all other major Japanese securitiescompanies &quot;will show a loss.&quot;   Securities firms are trying to cope with the drop inprofits by transferring people from home offices to retailbranch networks, hoping to drum up private investor supportfor the market. Early reports indicate some success, butinstitutional players are still shy of the market.   &quot;This market really needs a discountrate easing,&quot; Mr.Chudler of UBS Phillips said, noting that more than 40trillion yen is parked in the short-term money market asplayers decide where to put their cash. Life insurers andstock-market investment trusts have particularly largeamounts invested.   ---   World Market Activity                                                                                                          London stock prices fell Friday on political jitters. TheFinancial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index gave up 17.3points to 2476.0. The FT 30-stock index declined 12.8 pointsto 1935.8. Volume rose to 555.7 million shares from 483.4million shares in the previous session. Since Tuesday, the FT100 retreated 98.8 points, or about 4%, as investors weredispleased with the Conservative government's budgetproposal.   After the first post-budget political opinion pollsuggested that the April 9 national elections might end in ahung Parliament, investors were nervous Friday because ofmarket rumors that weekend polls would show the oppositionLabor Party leading the Tories by as much as 10 percentagepoints. In addition, hefty selling of equity futures took itstoll on stocks.   In Frankfurt, stock prices rose slightly in sluggishdealings. The DAX 30-stock index added 5.14 points to1732.64. Investors have recently been taking profits, andunfavorable German economic data Friday didn't provide anypositive inspiration.   Hong Kong shares rose to a third consecutive record,despite a strong wave of profit-taking. Stockholm equitiesreversed a two-day slide, gaining broadly on a strongerdollar and hopes for lower Swedish interest rates.
