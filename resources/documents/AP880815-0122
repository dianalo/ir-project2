They don't agree on when, where andhow severe.   The greenhouse effect is caused by the emission of such gases ascarbon dioxide and methane, trapping heat in the atmosphere.Scientists say steamy weather and crop losses are two of theproblems people can expect in coming decades.   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy andNatural Resources Committee, and Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., havepledged to make the greenhouse effect a legislative priority in1989.   Scientific testimony before the committee last week indicatedthe sharply opposing views being presented to Congress.   Do nothing until there is less scientific uncertainty, saidpolicymakers from the Reagan administration such as DonnaFitzpatrick, associate undersecretary of the Department of Energy.   Get moving now to reduce production of greenhouse gases, saidpeople such as Stephen Schneider, a climatologist from the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research, a Boulder, Colo., operation run bya consortium of universities.   Greenhouse-effect gases come from a variety of sources: from theburning of coal and other fossil fuels, production of suchchemicals as chlorofluorocarbons, the escape of huge amounts ofmethane from rice paddies and the release of carbon dioxide fromthe destruction of forests.   Some scientists have cautioned that even if the world reducedits production of greenhouse gases, those already in the atmospheremean that within 30 to 50 years the planet will have its highesttemperatures in 10,000 years.   Fitzpatrick said more knowledge is needed before Congresscommits the nation to combatting the greenhouse effect through thetype of program proposed in a comprehensive bill introduced byJohnston, Wirth and 16 colleagues.   ``Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the greenhouseeffect _ gaps that must be filled if we are to address the concernsraised by potential climate change in a scientifically supportablemanner,'' she said.   ``These scientific uncertainties must be reduced before wecommit the nation's economic future to drastic and potentiallymisplaced policy responses,'' she said.   Schneider, characterizing this position as ``political valuejudgments, not scientific opinions,'' said ``we should not useplatitudes about scientific uncertainty as an excuse for inaction.... There's a (scientific) concern that we are assaulting theenvironment much faster than we are understanding it.   ``More research will certainly put policy-making on a firmerscientific basis ... but it is my opinion that credible detailsabout specific `winners and losers' will not be available before wemay have committed ourselves to potentially dangerous, largeatmospheric changes,'' he said.   Officials from the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, Environmental Protection Agency and NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration told lawmakers of greenhouseresearch in their agencies.   They stopped short of seconding Fitzpatrick's stand that nothingshould be done to combat greenhouse gas production until morescientific certainty is attained.   Schneider said ``high-leverage actions are long overdue.'' Hecalled for steps that would combat greenhouse gases while attackingother environmental problems such as acid rain, low-level ozonepollution and destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer bychlorofluorocarbons.   He said his first priority would be greater energy efficiencyand conservation to reduce emissions from power plants andvehicles. No step, he said, should be considered too small becauseslowing down the greenhouse effect ``makes good sense.''</TEXT></DOC>
