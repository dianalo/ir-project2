KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted11-8 on Wednesday to insist that former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.North comply with a subpoena it issued five months ago demandingthat he produce hundreds of pages of classified diary pages.   The documents are sought by a Foreign Relations subcommitteeinvestigating international narcotics trafficking.   North and his attorney, Brendan L. Sullivan, have resistedproducing the diaries which North maintained as an official on thestaff of the National Security Council. He was fired from that jobamid disclosures he had been involved in the secret sale of U.S.arms to Iran and in the diversion of part of the proceeds toNicaragua's Contra rebels.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, sought thesubpoena after noticing heavily censored references to narcotics incopies of the diaries obtained by the congressional Iran-Contracommittees.   He said they were relevant to his panel's investigation becauseof references to narcotics, to apparent links to the Contras and tothe investigation itself.   The full committee issued the subpoena last April 26 on a 17-1vote.   On Wednesday, Kerry said the committee had met some ofSullivan's objections, narrowing the scope of the subpoena tosections of the diaries containing references relevant to thesubcommittee's probe and not insisting on receiving all 2,048 pages.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., continued to object to the decision topursue the subpoena, saying it was unfair when North is facingtrial in U.S. District Court here on charges growing out of theIran-Contra affair.   Some senators expressed doubt that the committee can obtain thesubpoenaed documents by the time the 100th Congress adjourns nextmonth.   Kerry, urging his colleagues not to accept further delay,referred to Sullivan and said: ``Delay plays into the hands of avery clever counselor and plays into the hands of those who want tosee all of this disappear.''</TEXT></DOC>
