JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The popularity of semiautomatic or automaticassault weapons is increasing dramatically among criminals,especially among those trafficking in illegal drugs, an anti-gungroup said Tuesday.   The group said police officials across the country are concernedabout how frequently criminals are found to possess high-poweredautomatic assault rifles or shotguns _ some capable of firing 30rounds in a few seconds.   ``The number of assault weapons in civilian hands _ bothcriminal and law abiding _ is estimated to be in the hundreds ofthousands, perhaps millions,'' said a report by the Education Fundto End Handgun Violence, which keeps track of the firearms industryand favors tighter controls over the sale of guns.   The group said there are no nationwide statistics available onthe misuse of such assault weapons, but that police organizations,government agencies and pro-gun control groups agree the number ofsuch weapons has increased dramatically in recent years.   Assault weapons are characterized by having the capability offiring a large number of rounds on a single magazine, great muzzlevelocity and compact design often including folding stocks thatmake it easier for the weapon to be concealed.   The assault weapons ``are quickly becoming the leading topic inAmerica's gun control debate and will most likely remain theleading gun control issue for the near future,'' the report said.   It said automatic and semiautomatic weapons such as the AR-15,AK-47 and Uzi are among the most popular weapons of drug dealersand are readily available in most states.   ``For criminals, the weapons look intimidating, have increasedfirepower, and can be purchased under the same controls as ahunting rifle or shotgun,'' the report said. It said the weaponsare popular not only among criminals, but also survivalists and``rank-and-file gun aficionados.''   While the group said no national statistics were available onhow many such weapons are in circulation, it said in 1987, almostone-third of the weapons seized by the Drug Enforcement Agency weresemiautomatic and 16 percent were fully automatic.   Of the 388 guns seized by the Washington D.C. police departmentduring the first six weeks of this year, ``the vast majority wereeither semiautomatic or fully automatic,'' the report said.   The study was conducted in conjunction with the New Right Watch,a group which monitors right wing organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
