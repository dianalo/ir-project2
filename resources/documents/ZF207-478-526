H. (Sonny)Chaffin, president of Sony's Optical Storage Systems Co. Sony has been aleader in the development of many storage technologies, including the 31/2-inch and new 2-inch floppy-disk formats, as well as optical storage.andP;  JonPepper, a regular contributor to LOTUS, conducted this interview with Chaffinin May.andM;LOTUS: How does an MO drive work?andM;Chaffin: An MO disk is coated with a layer of magneto-optical material andencased in a rigid cartridge.andP;  To record data, a laser beam in the dirveheats a spot on the disk.andP;  This shifts the magnetic field to a particularpolarity and records a bit of data.andP;  To erase data, the magnetic field isreversed.andP;  New data can then be recorded.andP;  To read data, the drive uses alower-power laser beam, which interprets each data bit as either a digital 1or 0.andM;LOTUS: Who will use optical storage?andM;Chaffin: Anyone who needs large amounts of data that isn't available in thehard-disk environment.andP;  As we move into a digital world in which graphics andfull-motion video become common, we will have an ever-increasing need fordata storage.andP;  We think optical will provide users with an answer to thatneed.andM;Also, there will be trickle-down effect.andP;  Initially, people are buying it foruse in workstation environments or as a backup medium for a host computer.andO;But as time goes by and the cost comes down--as it does with most products inthe electronics field--there will be more innovative applications that makeuse of MO disks.andM;LOTUS: Does a typical PC user really need 650 megabytes of storage?andM;Chaffin: MO disks are good for archiving and backing up data.andP;  We think manypeople will want to use them in lieu of a LAN.andP;  You can pass huge amounts ofdata back and forth simply by handling over a cartridge.andM;LOTUS: But is optical storage the only option for these applications?andP;  Alarge-capacity Winchester hard disk still costs less.andM;Chaffin: Optical offers the greatest combination of features: large-capacitystorage, data transfer, and security.andP;  With a hard disk, you have a realproblem if it crashes.andP;  Optical drives can't crash because no read/write haedtouches the disk.andP;  And unlike CD-ROM disks, our MO disks are permanentlyencased inside a plastic cartridge.andP;  Information is recorded onto theinterior of the disk, so scratches or other surface damage don't result indata loss.andM;LOTUS: Will optical drives ever match the 28-millisecond-or-less access timesof most conventional hard drives?andM;Chaffin: Access times are now around 80 milliseconds, and we're working toimprove them.andP;  MO speed will probably never be competitive with magnetic.andO;But over time, we think the advantages of optical technologies will overcomethe speed advantage of hard-disk drives.andM;LOTUS: Can disk-caching and other techniques that are used with magnetic harddrives also speed up the access time for MO?andM;Chaffin: Yes.andP;  The same techniques can speed up MO access times.andM;LOTUS: How quickly will rewritable optical drives become commonplace?andP;  Andwhen will the price drop?andM;Chaffin: It depends on how quickly hardware manufacturers adopt thetechnology.andP;  Probably within two years you will see a wide range of peopleusing MO.andM;The retail price of our MO drive is about $4,500 for a 650-megabyte drive,and the cartridge costs about $230.andP;  I see prices going the same wayeverything else has.andP;  The first hand-held calculator, from HP, was $400.andP;  Ithink tht prices will drop significantly within two to three years.andM;LOTUS: Who are the leading players in the optical market?andP;  And how will theyavoid the lack of standardization that still affects the WORM market?andM;Chaffin: Sony, Ricoh, Canon, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Maxoptix (formerly Maxtor)all are or will be players in the market.andP;  Maxoptix is the only U.S.andP;  companyinvolved right now.andM;The situation with WORM drives is a lesson for us, as was the situation withBeta and VHS videocassette standards.andP;  Most companies have to balance acommercial edge of technological superiority with the ability to sell theproduct to many people.andM;But there are already some standards out there for MO.andP;  Our product complieswith the proposed ISO/ANSI standards, so Sony's drive and disk can be usedinterchangeably with any other drive and disk that conforms.andP;  Somemanufacturers don't follow those standards yet, but they will have a hardtime trying to move nonstandard drives.andM;LOTUS: What does the future hold for MO?andM;Chaffin: Greater storage capacity, faster access times, and the ability tocombine audio, video, and data.andP;  These improvements will help to get thistechnology into the hands of the consumer.andP;  If you can drive the businesstechnology into the consumer world, you get an expansion of features and adrop in the price.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
