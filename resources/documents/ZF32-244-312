 Andcustomers clearly responded positively to the event, crowding around the twobooths at the show that had specialized in putting CD-ROM tides up for sale.andO;In the Educorp booth in the Moscone Convention Center or in the Bureau ofElectronic Publishing in Brooks Hall, customers could select from afascinating range of titles ranging from old favorites to brand-new entries.andO;Educorp's special show catalog listed 135 distinct titles for sale at pricesranging from $50 (mostly games and children's literature) to $500 (businessand professional databases and font collections).andP;  In both booths, as well,customers could acquire CD-ROM drives at discount prices (as little as $400for the portable NEC drive).andP;  Educorp, which was much better merchandisedthan the Bureau of Electronic Publishing, and included demonstrations by manyof the vendors, said that it expected to sell out all of the hundreds ofdrives it had brought to the show.andM;(What is truly ironic is that, in the past six months, most people have beenfocusing their attention on Microsoft's efforts to establish a standardmultimedia platform for Intel-based computers, the success of which BillGates himself says is dependent on Microsoft's ability to motivate publishersto create a compelling range of titles.andP;  And yet the first instance of thatphenomenon occurring is on the Macintosh.andP;  And the reason it is happening onthe Macintosh first is because Apple had the ability and the stomach to makeall of the necessary elements for multimedia publishing standard in itsmachines at least three years ago, when it put together the Macintosh II with8-bit color and sound output, a CD-ROM drive, and a basic authoring systemwith Hypercard.andP;  Me time to market for the selection of titles should beinstructive to Microsoft, since it seems to have taken the Macintosh aboutthree years to develop a satisfactory range of titles, despite the fact thatApple controls the system and has been promoting CD-ROM developmentaggressively.)andM;The three titles that really stood out at the show were:andM;DICIS BOOKS:  This is actually a set of ten children's books, including suchclassics as Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit, Cinderella, ScaryPoems For Rotten Kids, and Moving Gives Me A Stomach Ache.andP;  Theimplementation of these books on CD-ROM is incredibly simple and compelling.andO;The books appear on screen two pages at a time with their original text andillustrations.andP;  Me reader can either have the book read to them page by page,with a highlight showing what text is being read or they can click ondifferent words, phrases, or parts of the illustration to get pronunciations,definitions, or other background.andP;  These disk books avoid the problem that alot of CD-ROM products don't, which is that they don't make navigation or theoverall structure so complex that it's not worth wandering around.andP;  (Indeed,I liked them so much I actually bought The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and ScaryPoems.)andM;SPACESHIP WARLOCK: This CD-ROM, due to ship in a week, is to my knowledge thefirst CD-ROM-only game.andP;  (In other words, there is no magnetic disk versionof the game.andP;  I could be wrong, since there may be games for the FM-Townsmachine in Japan that had never been published in any other format.andP;  Also TheVoyager Company was demonstrating another CD-ROM-only game called The Fool'sErrand, by Cliff Johnson, which is not scheduled to be available until May.)andO;Spaceship Warlock also requires a Macintosh II with an 8-bit color screen andsound output, which makes it the first game that requires a $4,000 platform(the cost of a Macintosh IIsi with a CD-ROM drive).andP;  The game is acombination of Starflight's vast universe (see 'Starflight: ReallyEntertaining Artificial Intelligence,&quot; Issue 2.15, 08-21-86) and TheManhole's charming animation and illustration (see  Manhole:  Re FirstHypercard Adventure Game,&quot; Issue 4.15, 08-25-88).andP;  Warlock was developedusing Macromind Director and so has much of the same, animated quality ofmany of the Director demos or presentations you've probably seen.andP;  But, fromwatching the crowd's reactions to the demos, it also seems to have a lot ofplay value and so may represent a new genre of games developed specificallyfor CD-ROM based computers.andM;INTERACTIVE TRAVEL ENCYCLOPEDIA: This is exactly what its title says it is -a series of CD-ROMs that serve as a guide to travelling around differentregions of the world.andP;  What makes it special is that - to my knowledge - thisis the first attempt to make an interactive multimedia travel title andactually sell it for real money.andP;  There have been hundreds of demonstrationsof how such systems might took if implemented in an airline reservationsystem, a travel agent's workstation, or a real estate agent's kiosk.andP;  But,in this case, the Hong Kong publisher, Interoptica, was demonstrating thefirst volume of the series, The Orient, at Educorp's booth and Educorp wasselling it for $280 (list price: $400).andM;If you are serious about understanding CD-ROM publishing and multimedia, youshould definitely get catalogues from both of the distributors that wereselling these titles at Macworld Expo.andP;  Call the Bureau of ElectronicPublishing in Parsippany, New Jersey at 800-828-4766 for a 160-page cataloguethat covers both the Macintosh and PC and costs $4.95.andP;  Call Educorp in SanDiego, California at 619-536-9999 for information (and ask for their 86-pageMacworld Expo catalogue) or at 800-843-9491- to place an order.andP;  And, if youdon't already know about The Voyager Company, which sells both CD-ROMs andvideodisc products, call them in Santa Monica, California at 213-451-1383 andask for their catalogue of interactive multimedia products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
