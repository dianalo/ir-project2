Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to changethe U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles.   The Democratic-controlled panel voted 12-3 against Helms'amendment, which would allow non-nuclear U.S. cruise missiles to bedeployed in Europe.   The pact signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev bans missiles of ranges from 300 to 3,400miles. The prohibition includes cruise missiles, bothnuclear-tipped and those armed with non-nuclear weapons.   The ban covers both types of missiles because ``there's no wayto verify the distinction between'' the two, said Sen. AlanCranston, D-Calif.   But Helms said the ban means ``the conventional imbalance inEurope will be even greater than it is now'' because NATO will losea major weapon in the cruise missile.   Cranston responded that the Pentagon has no plans to buildnon-nuclear cruise missiles.   The vote came on the first of 43 pending amendments orreservations, either to the treaty text or the resolution by whichthe Senate would register its approval of the pact.   Of those amendments, 36 were proposed by Helms, the committee'sranking Republican and the chief opponent of the treaty. Three morewere offered by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., who has also beencritical of the pact.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the committee, toldhis colleagues that he intends ``to oppose all reservations,conditions, etc.,'' with the possible exception of amendmentsdesigned to solve a long-running fight between the Reaganadministration and Congress over treaty intepretation.   Helms said today the committee shouldn't be ``a rubber stamp''for the administration, which has urged approval of the treatywithout changes.   Both Democratic and Republican leaders predict overwhelmingratification when the treaty reaches the Senate floor and say only10 or 12 senators are likely to vote against it. Ratificationrequires a two-thirds vote of the 100-member Senate.   ``I don't intend to obstruct'' the committee's work on thetreaty, Helms told his colleagues Tuesday, but he added, ``I'mconcerned that we're about to rush to judgment.''   Given the large number of amendments, Pell said the panel now``seems very unlikely'' to meet its original goal of finishing workby Friday.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., told Helms, ``If you don't have thevotes and you simply try to overload it with amendments, that isn'tfair.''   Most of Helms' amendments are designed to improve what he saysare compliance verification problems and clear up ambiguities.   The majority of Helms' proposals would amend the ratificationresolution, which would not require new negotiations with theSoviet Union.   Any change made by the Senate in the actual text of the treatywould have to be accepted by the Soviet Union, and administrationofficials have urged the Senate to avoid so-called ``killeramendments'' that would cause the Soviets to reject new talks.   The treaty requires the elimination of nuclear-armed missileswith a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles and includes on-siteinspection provisions among its verification system, which is themost intrusive in arms control history.   The Foreign Relations Committee heard endorsements of the pactTuesday from two other committees, Intelligence and Armed Services,which had also looked at the treaty during the past two months.   But the congressional debate over the treaty has been clouded bythe reopening of a long fight between the Democratic-controlledCongress and the White House.   The complicated legal fight involves the question of whether anadministration has the legal right to unilaterally change how theUnited States interprets a treaty. Reagan asserts theadministration has such a right, but Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairmanof the Armed Services Committee, and other legislators havedisagreed.   The fight involves the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, butit has spilled over into the debate on the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty, Nunn told the Foreign Relations Committee.   Nunn said letters written by White House Counsel Arthur B.Culvahouse Jr. effectively undercut previous assurances fromSecretary of State George P. Shultz that administration testimonyon the new pact is ``authoritative.''   Nunn said Culvahouse asserted that some administration responsesmay be less authoritative than others.   Culvahouse suggested that the testimony of a secretary of statemay be more authoritative than that of other administrationwitnesses or responses in writing to questions by members ofCongress, Nunn said.   Culvahouse has since issued a second letter asserting that hisoriginal remarks were not inconsistent with the Shultz statement.But Nunn said he finds that unacceptable.   Nunn said the new letter ``puts the Shultz statement in thetrashcan, saying that certain testimony is not to be takenseriously.''   The dispute should be resolved by the full Senate instead ofseeking another letter from the administration, even from thepresident, said Nunn.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said the dispute ``is the majorstumbling block and could create grave perils if we don't resolveit.''</TEXT></DOC>
