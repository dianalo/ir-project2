Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., 24, a one-time intern of theprominent brokerage Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., also pleaded guilty to asingle charge in connection with his role in a previouslyundisclosed insider trading scheme.   Wang, wearing a charcoal gray suit and spectacles, entered hisguilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy in Manhattan,who set sentencing for Oct. 19. If convicted of all three counts,Wang faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and $750,000 infines.   ``Was there any doubt in your mind that what you were doing waswrong?'' Duffy asked Wang, who stood during the proceeding inManhattan federal court. He replied, ``There was no doubt in mymind.''   The charges were announced earlier today by U.S. AttorneyRudolph W. Giuliani, who said that from June 1987 to July 1988,Wang participated in an insider trading scheme with Taiwanese-bornbusinessman Fred C. Lee.   Giuliani said the scheme involved trading in the securities ofmore than 14 companies involved in mergers and takeovers whereMorgan Stanley played a role.   Lee, who has residences in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the UnitedStates, has been said by the Securities and Exchange Commission tohave traded stocks on the tips provided by Wang and netted at least$19 million in illicit profits. He allegedly shared at least$200,000 of the money with Wang.   The SEC has frozen the assets of both men and sought repaymentof the $19 million plus triple damages for a total of $76 million.That would be the second-largest amount seized by the SEC in aninsider trading case since master speculator Ivan Boeskysurrendered $100 million nearly two years ago.   Giuliani also said that in addition to the scheme with Lee, Wangwas charged with participating in an earlier scheme to engage ininsider trading with an individual living in the Chicago areastarting in June 1986, when Wang started working at Morgan Stanley.   The U.S. attorney declined to further identify the individual inthe second scheme but said the person was not one of Wang'srelatives.   Giuliani said Wang would cooperate with the government and thatthe investigation is continuing, an indication that others might becharged.   Earlier today, Wang pleaded innocent to one count each of mailfraud, wire fraud and securities fraud before U.S. MagistrateBarbara Lee in Manhattan, but the move was a technical prelude tohis subsequent guilty plea.   Under federal criminal procedure, guilty pleas cannot be enteredbefore U.S. magistrates, and the move is often an indication that adefendant has negotiated a plea agreement with prosecutors.   The U.S. magistrate set Wang's bail at $250,000.</TEXT></DOC>
