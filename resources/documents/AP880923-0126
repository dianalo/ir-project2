Police said they detained more than 100 protesters but had noinformation about the number of people hurt.   About 200 striking civilian workers demanding higher pay at anavy shipyard threw rocks at security forces at Plaza Manco Capac,reporters said.   The government has declared the strike illegal and threatened tofire the employees if they fail to return to work by Friday.   An austerity program announced by the government of populistPresident Alan Garcia on Sept. 6 led to widespread protests andlooting in many provincial cities.   The program included a currency devaluation of 86 percent andelimination of costly government subsidies of basic consumer itemswhich contribute to an inflation rate expected to reach 1,000percent this year.   Riot police tried to turn back a demonstration by 4,000shantytown settlers who marched from Lima's outskirts toward thedowntown area to protest price increases of up to 500 percent forsome consumer items in the last two weeks.   Police fired tear gas but the crowd was so large that mostmarchers managed to break past barricades and regroup at Plaza 2 deMayo, 15 blocks from the Government Palace.   Police fired buckshot and tear gas grenades in Plaza San Martinto break up a demonstration of 2,000 people led by women bangingempty pots to protest the austerity program. Police acted when theprotesters tried to march the six blocks from the plaza to theGovernment Palace.   An Associated Press newsman saw a girl about 10 years oldbleeding from buckshot wounds in the face.   A bomb containing about five pounds of dynamite exploded at10:25 p.m. Wednesday (11:25 p.m. EDT) at a side entrance to theEconomy Ministry in downtown Lima. The blast severely injured a12-year-old girl selling hot drinks from a street vendor's cart, apoliceman and 17 other people, many of them waiting for buses,police said.   Officers said the bomb was left beside the cart by pro-Cubanguerrillas.   Another bomb the same size exploded three minutes later and 12blocks away outside an office of the Agriculture Ministry, butcaused no injuries.   Police said pamphlets from the pro-Cuba Tupac AmaruRevolutionary Movement which were left at the site attacked theausterity measures as a ``cruel and unjustified blow to the poor.''   Elsewhere, three hooded gunmen believed to be guerrillas fromthe Maoist Shining Path movement killed a village mayor five milesoutside Trujillo, a city 350 miles northwest of Lima, as hisl5-year-old son looked on Wednesday, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
