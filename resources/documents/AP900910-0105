The spokesman said Iran had pledged to abide by the globalembargo against Iraq, and would be expected to honor thatcommitment.   ``They've been enemies for so long. It's hard to believe Iran'sgoing to be too supportive in this effort,'' Fitzwater said.   ``It shows (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's reaching to acountry where he murdered millions of their people,'' Fitzwateradded. `So, he's grasping at any straw he can find.''   Despite the bloody eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, Iranannounced it was establishing diplomatic relations with Iraq.   The official Iranian news agency said the agreement between Iranand Iraq was reached in a meeting between Iranian Foreign MinisterAli Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, who endeda 24-hour visit to Iran today.   Separately, Saddam offered to supply oil free of charge to ThirdWorld countries in what he said was a gesture of solidarity.   Fitzwater predicted the offer would be spurned.   ``It is an affront to all countries for Saddam to think thatthey would sacrifice the principles of freedom and non-aggressionfor the Iraqi oil or the oil that he has taken through his nakedaggression against Kuwait,'' the press spokesman said.   Dismissing Saddam's offer, Fitzwater said, ``It means nothing.The sanctions (approved by the United Nations) clearly cover theoil, at any cost.''</TEXT></DOC>
