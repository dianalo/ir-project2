A number of papers concerned the responseand performance of CR-39 detectors. These included some contributionson the effects of ageing and environment on CR-39 and others which discussedthe polymer physics of CR-39. Dosimetry systems and the application oftrack-etch detectors to neutron spectrometry were amongst the other topicsdealt with.</TEXT></DOC>
