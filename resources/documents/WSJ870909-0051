But dealers said they expect further declines for the currency and cited the report due Friday on the U.S. merchandise trade balance for July.    Because of the U.S.'s Labor Day holiday Monday, yesterday was the first opportunity for many currency traders to react to the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's move Friday raising its discount rate to 6% from 5 1/2%. The Fed's move was seen in part as an attempt to support the slipping dollar, as higher U.S. interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.    Traders, however, remained doubtful that higher rates will help the U.S. currency much if market estimates on the U.S. trade deficit for July prove to be even roughly accurate.    &quot;Whether it's higher or lower from the previous month isn't all that important,&quot; Paul R. Loffredo, vice president and chief dealer for Los Angeles-based Security Pacific National Bank in New York, said.    &quot;What counts is that the number is probably going to be a bad number again, and anything above $14 billion is a bad number.&quot;    Last month, the Commerce Department said that the U.S. in June imported $15.71 billion of goods in excess of what it exported. The trade gap was far wider than the market expected at the time, and it sent the dollar tumbling. This time, economists generally expect a $15 billion deficit for July, but some estimates range as high as $18 billion.    Yesterday's relative calm in the currency markets was attributed to coordinated central bank intervention in European trading aimed at supporting the dollar. The volume of central bank purchases was relatively small. But to the traders, the message was clear.    The intervention removed the &quot;bravado&quot; from the market's selling of dollars, Douglas Madison, a trader at BankAmerica International in New York, said. &quot;There's an unwillingness to sell too much more&quot; in the face of central bank activity, he said.    According to traders, the central banks of West Germany, Britain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Italy were involved in yesterday's dollar purchases in Europe. In addition, the Bank of France sold West German marks for French francs, traders said. This would tend to support the dollar by increasing the number of marks in circulation.    In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan sought exchange rate quotes from market participants, which it often does as a prelude to intervention. But the central bank didn't buy any dollars, traders said.    In New York, the Fed's foreign exchange desk wasn't active in the market, bank traders said.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7945 marks, compared with 1.7920 in late London trading Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. The dollar also firmed to 1.4850 Swiss francs from 1.4845 in London Monday, and the British pound eased to $1.6603 from $1.6615. The U.S. currency slipped to 141.55 Japanese yen from 141.75 in London Monday.    The dollar was quoted at 141.65 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    The dollar &quot;will probably stay around&quot; its current level until Friday's trade report, Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;The central banks basically put a floor under it,&quot; he said.    Security Pacific's Mr. Loffredo said, &quot;The sentiment is still to sell (dollars), but with the central banks coming in to buy, some of the impetus to sell is gone.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $457.80 an ounce, down $5.30 from Friday's level, in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $458.50 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Tuesday, Sept. 8, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
