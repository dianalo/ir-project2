(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Carnations, roses and memories will fill achapel when sons and daughters gather to honor their mothersSunday, 80 years after the nation's first Mother's Day service wascelebrated here.   ``We expect to have a full house. We usually do,'' said LenoreShafer, a tour guide at the Mother's Day Shrine. ``I thinkeverybody has a feeling for their mother.   ``Everybody doesn't have children, but everybody has a mother.''   Tourists from all 50 states, England, Canada and even Japan havevisited the shrine, located in a former Methodist church built in1872, Shafer said.   ``Some like the hard-carved pews, others come to see our stainedglass windows and murals,'' said Betty Hayhurst, chairwoman of thecommittee that oversees the shrine. ``A lot of young people comehere too. It's not just old people.''   Anna Jarvis, the founder of national Mother's Day, spelled outits purpose in a letter to organizers 80 years ago: ``To revive thedormant love and filial gratitude we owe to those who gave usbirth. ... To brighten the lives of good mothers. To have them knowwe appreciate them, though we do not often show it as we might.''   The first Mother's Day celebration on May 10, 1908, at AndrewsMethodist Church in Grafton, and another at Wanamaker's Auditoriumin Philadelphia that afternoon, marked the death of Miss Jarvis'mother, Anna Maria Jarvis, three years earlier.   Back in the 1850s, when the area around Grafton was still partof Virginia, Mrs. Jarvis had been spurred to work againstunsanitary living conditions in the region by the deaths of eightof her 12 children before they reached adulthood.   Her ``Mother's Day Work Clubs'' in Grafton and nearby towns wereso successful that doctors urged others to follow her example. Theclubs also won praise for easing hostility among neighbors duringthe Civil War, when the slavery issue divided families andultimately divided Virginia itself.   Throughout the last years of her life, Mrs. Jarvis shared herdream of a day set aside for the mothers of the world _ living anddead _ with Anna.   But she did not live long enough to see her dream come true.   According to the book ``Mother's Day and the Mother's DayChurch,'' Anna, then a 41-year-old spinster, vowed to herself toestablish Mother's Day as her mother's casket was being loweredinto her grave at West Chester, Pa.   The idea soon became an obsession as Miss Jarvis worked topromote the day with personal appearances and letter-writingcampaigns.   She finally persuaded John Wanamaker, a Philadelphia merchantand philanthropist, to support her in her quest. Wanamaker laterbecame part of a committee, along with food manufacturer H.J.Heinz, that mapped out a program to extend Mother's Day around theworld.   After the first celebration in 1908, the idea caught on quickly,and by the following year Mother's Day was observed in at least onetown in nearly all the states, as well as Puerto Rico, Canada andMexico.   A year later, Gov. William E. Glasscock proclaimed the secondSunday in May as Mother's Day in West Virginia, and in 1914,President Woodrow Wilson did the same for the whole country.   Flowers have been part of Mother's Day since Miss Jarvis sent500 white carnations, chosen to represent purity, to Grafton forthe first celebration. Participants were urged to wear a redcarnation if their mother was living, and white if their mother wasdead.   ``It is definitely the biggest holiday of the year for us,''said Rocky Pollitz, vice president of industry relations forTeleflora, the nation's largest independently owned floral company.   ``People may not think of sending flowers all year, but onMother's Day, everybody thinks of flowers.''   Many, whose mothers have died, send flowers to the shrine,Hayhurst said. The flowers are taken to nursing homes and hospitalsfollowing the Mother's Day service.</TEXT></DOC>
