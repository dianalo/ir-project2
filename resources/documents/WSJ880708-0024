Late in the New York day, the dollar was quoted at 1.8230 marks, up from 1.8205 marks late Wednesday, and at 132.85 yen, down from 133.35 yen.    In mid-morning dealings in Tokyo on Friday, the dollar was changing hands at about 132.30 yen.    The U.S. unit fell in Asia Thursday as dealers took profits on recent gains and cautiously adjusted positions ahead of next Friday's release of U.S. trade figures for May. European traders continued the sell-off.    The West German Bundesbank reportedly intervened again, selling dollars for around 1.8155 marks, only to have its work undone by New York traders in what is becoming a familiar pattern.    The dollar staged a choppy rally on a combination of short-covering and dubious, sometimes conflicting, market rumors circulating in New York and at the International Monetary Market currency futures exchange in Chicago.    Among the rumors, all of them discounted, were that a U.S. Treasury official said the dollar should be at 135 yen; a Bank of Japan official said the same; a Treasury official said the U.S. believes the dollar is too high at its present level; the Bank of Japan believes the same; and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa had resigned.    An official of the Bank of Japan in New York said the central bank hadn't any comment on the specific rumors, but added: &quot;Generally speaking, central bankers don't make any comment or refer to any specific level or range&quot; for currencies.    Of the rumor regarding Mr. Miyazawa, the Bank of Japan officer said: &quot;It's 2:50 . . . in the morning, July 8th in Japan. It's quite unlikely that such an announcement would be made at this hour.&quot;    A U.S. Treasury spokesman in Washington said of the rumors and the unconfirmed report: &quot;No Treasury official has said anything about the dollar.&quot;    Most traders said they put little credence in the various rumors, which they said are symptomatic of a market lacking outside signals or conviction.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $439.10 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $438.75 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                  Late New York Trading                  Thursday, July 7, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
