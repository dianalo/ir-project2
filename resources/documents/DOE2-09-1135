The widespread use of disposables has beenmade possible by the availability of cheap materials (plastics) for itsmanufacture, the large scale/low cost production and development of industrialsterilization techniques. The emphasis here is on radiation sterilizationtechniques and their importance at the industrial level. Technical, economical,safety and other aspects are compared with other techniques, mainly basedon the use of toxic gases. Sterilization of plastic medical productsand pharmaceuticals is discussed. The comparative analysis indicatesmuch higher reliability of radiation sterilization combined with highersafety standards at acceptable or lower cost, as compared with othertechniques.
