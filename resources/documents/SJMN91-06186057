And nobody can be expected toscore 100 percent in that category.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  JAMES' HITS AND MISSES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Rotisserie Report  </MEMO><TEXT>     So, Bill, I'm sure you're smiling, too, when you look back on some of yourpreseason comments from &quot;The Baseball Book 1991.&quot; I'm even including a couplethat were on the mark.;    (check) Harold Baines. &quot;In view of his age (32) andextreme lack of speed (he hasn't stolen a base in four years), he is probablyof less real than perceived value.&quot; Well, through Tuesday, Baines trailed onlyDave Henderson and Jose Canseco in at-bats for the A's and was hitting aclub-leading .326 with 11 homers and 51 RBIs. No stolen bases, but he has onetriple, Bill.;    (check) Scott Erickson. After a series of mostly negativecomments, James softened up and projected Erickson as a guy who might go 15-12with a 3.44 ERA. &quot;But do I project him as a top pitcher, the answer is no.&quot;Er, Bill, he's 12-3 with a 1.83 ERA for Minnesota so far.;    (check) KevinGross. &quot;This could be a great free-agent signing. . . . If he's healthy, he'llwin 15 games for the Dodgers.&quot; Through Tuesday, he's 4-5 with a 4.60 ERA.;   (check) Mike LaCoss. &quot;Can he still pitch? As well as ever, yes. . . . He'sbeen consistent for five years, with ERAs all in the threes. He's a good, safeplayer to have on your team.&quot; Hmmmm. When he was released Wednesday, LaCosswas 1-5 with a 7.23 ERA. He had given up 61 hits in 47 1/3 innings.;   (check) Dick Schofield. OK, here's one that sticks out as perceptive. Based onwhat Schofield did in his last 55 games in 1990, plus James' observations fromcertain games, the prediction was &quot;that Schofield is going to have his bestmajor league season in 1991.&quot; Right on target. The California shortstop,coming off an injury, is hitting .263 and has been used primarily in the firstand second spots in the lineup.;    (check) Tom Glavine. Let's finish on apositive note. &quot;I like him better now than I ever have,&quot; wrote James, takingissue with a Sporting News headline that said Glavine symbolized mediocrity.&quot;I can see him as a good pitcher,&quot; he concluded. Indeed, Glavine is 11-4 witha 2.06 ERA.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Antonucci column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910704  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  423  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 4, 199100186057,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
