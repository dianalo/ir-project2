Lyles, producer of``Conversations With the Presidents,'' a one-hour show to be shownon ABC on Saturday.   ``Mr. Reagan told them, `Rex must see something I don't see.'Mrs. Roosevelt used to talk about how Lincoln would come and visitwith her.''   Lyles, who has known Ronald Reagan since their early days inHollywood, persuaded Reagan _ and former Presidents Ford and Carter_ to talk with groups of children.   Reagan talked to the children at the White House. Carter was atthe Presidential Center at Atlanta, and Ford at Rancho Mirage,Calif.   Former President Nixon withdrew from the show after ABCannounced a miniseries based on the book ``Final Days,'' which toldof his last days as president before he resigned.   ``Ronald Reagan and I came to Hollywood about the same time,''said Lyles, who has been with Paramount Studios for 50 years. ``Isaw a side I liked, the human side. Most people don't see that. Ithought what a wonderful thing it would be if children talked tothe presidents.   ``I remember when I was just a kid working on the newspaper inJacksonville, Fla., and I interviewed President Roosevelt when hecame to town. I took the idea to ABC, got an OK. I mentioned it tothe president when I was on Air Force One, and he loved the idea.Then I got in touch with the former presidents.''   Lyles said he wanted children because they ask questions adultswould never think to ask. One child asked Reagan what he wasthinking about when he was sworn in as president. Another asked himhow he met the first lady and did they kiss on their first date.   Carter told of being the first person in his family to go tocollege, adding that he went to the Naval Academy because it wasfree.   ``Carter told them his house had no running water and there wasno electricity in the town,'' Lyles said. ``He said their onlysource of entertainment was the radio. Every night they took thebattery out of the car and rigged it up to run the radio. Carterwas asked who he would like to play him in a movie, and he saidRobert Redford. Ford told them of being the only president who wasadopted as a child.''   Lyles said he thought the children would be intimidated at goingto the White House to meet Reagan. ``But they went right in and Ithink the president put them right at ease,'' he said. ``I don'tknow who had more fun, the kids or the president.''   The children, who were selected by the schools in each area,ranged in age from 9 to 14.   ``One girl told me her grandfather was going to tape the show,''said Lyles. ``She said she could hardly wait to show it to herkids.''   Lyles talked about the show at Paramount studios, where he ispractically an institution. His office walls are covered withdozens of pictures of himself with stars and other famous people.On a tripod in his office is an old hand-cranked Mitchell cameraused to film ``Wings,'' the first movie to win an Academy Award.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   EMMY DEADLINE _ The deadline for entering the 40th annualPrimetime Emmy Awards competition is April 15, according to theAcademy of Television Arts andamp; Sciences.
