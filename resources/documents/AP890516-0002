Authorities summonedhim for questioning on Wednesday.   Katsuya Ikeda cited personal reasons for his resignation fromParliament and from the Komeito, or Clean Government Party. Thefour-term member of the House of Representatives was the secondopposition lawmaker to step down.   Ikeda, 51, and Rep. Takao Fujinami, 56, a member of thegoverning Liberal Democratic Party and a senior aide to formerPrime Minister Yasushiro Nakasone, arrived for questioning earlyWednesday at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office.   They were the first elected officials to be questioned assuspects in the scandal, which involves purchases of stock in theRecruit Co.   Prosecutors are believed to have chosen questioning and notarrest due to legal difficulties involving the incarceration of alawmaker, particularly when Parliament is in session. Theseriousness of the move is regarded as equivalent to arrest byJapanese legal custom.   Meanwhile, Komeito chairman Junya Yano told a news conference hewas stepping down as party head to take responsibility forKomeito's link to a series of scandals including Recruit.   Yano was the second opposition party leader to resign because ofRecruit. Saburo Tsukamoto resigned as head of the DemocraticSocialist Party in February after it was revealed he profited fromRecruit share transactions.   Prosecutors said they suspect Ikeda and Fujinami used theirinfluence to the advantage of Recruit and received bribes in theform of bargain-priced unlisted stocks.   Ikeda has admitted his brother, Yuzuru, bought 5,000 shares inRecruit and earned about $73,530 in profit. He denied his own linkto the stock transaction, but news reports said $51,470 of theprofit was deposited into Ikeda's bank account.   Ikeda, who also received $102,940 in donations from Recruit,resigned from Parliament to take responsibility for ``causingtroubles'' for his Buddhist-affiliated party, the second-largestopposition group after the Socialists. His resignation must beapproved by the house speaker.   Fujinami, 56, has acknowledged his secretary, Eiji Tokuda,bought 12,000 shares in Recruit in October 1986. After a publiclisting about a month later, share prices shot up quickly, andTokuda netted $191,000 in profit.   The Liberal Democrat has said the stock deal was Tokuda'sbusiness and denied personal involvement. However, news reportssaid Fujinami used the profit to buy a luxury home in Tokyo.   Fujinami is also known to have received about $661,000 inpolitical donations from Recruit.   Fujinami, who was Nakasone's top Cabinet aide between 1984 and1987, is widely seen as holding a key to the link between Recruitand Nakasone. Critics say Fujinami's testimony will determinewhether further prosecution is possible for other seniorpoliticians, including Nakasone.   On Tuesday, Nakasone reportedly agreed to testify about his rolein the scanda. Opposition parties have stalled parliamentarybusiness to back demands that he testify.   Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of the stock deals,previously said he would testify in Parliament only afterprosecutors completed the Recruit investigation.   This time, in a meeting with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the governingparty's deputy secretary general, Nakasone did not set anyconditions, the Kyodo News Service said.   The Recruit information conglomerate, accused of trying toinfluence government policy, sold such shares in a subsidiary toabout 160 influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.   It also made large political contributions to politiciansincluding Takeshita, who announced last month he would resign totake responsibility for the scandal.   The Liberal Democratic Party still is searching for a candidateuntainted by the scandal to succeed Takeshita.   Prosecutors have arrested 14 public officials and Recruitexecutives on charges of bribery and securities law violations inthe stock deals. In addition, three members of Takeshita's Cabinethave resigned because of links with Recruit.   In November, a member of the Japan Socialist Party, Takumi Ueda,gave up his seat in Parliament after news reports linked him withthe scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
