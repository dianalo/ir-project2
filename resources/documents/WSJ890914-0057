The combined budgets for the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services would grow more than 9% to $138 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. And $67 billion -- representing a 10.5% increase -- is provided for the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Housing and Urban Development as well as space and environmental agencies.    Current funding for the ambitious space-station program would be more than doubled to $1.85 billion. On a 22-5 roll call, the panel agreed to set aside $10 million in space funds to sustain the early construction of a costly advanced solid rocket motor facility in Mississippi. Without debate, the committee agreed to reject new funding for the high-speed national aerospace plane backed by the Bush administration, but $20 million was preserved to begin the $1.6 billion Craf-Cassini space mission.    National Science Foundation funding would be increased 7.3% to more than $2 billion, and total spending for programs under the Environmental Protection Agency would grow more than 9%, including a $150 million increase for the hazardous-waste superfund.    The increased funding for acquired immune deficiency syndrome research and treatment is a factor in pushing up the total budget for the National Institutes of Health to $7.7 billion. But the Senate committee gives less discretion to the NIH than the House in deciding how the AIDS funds are, in fact, allocated. Gay activists have expressed fear that funds designated for AIDS research will be diverted to other areas of research and, despite the size of the budgets yesterday, there is often fierce competition by different interest groups for the available funds.    While setting aside $1.2 billion for an expanded federal role in child care, the committee conceded that only a fraction of this money -- about $5 million -- has any likelihood of being spent in the next fiscal year. Elsewhere, budget constraints forced a cut of $154 million from low-income fuel assistance -- a major priority in the House -- and the committee cut in half a proposed House initiative to add more than $1 billion for federal aid for the education of young public-school students from disadvantaged families.    The debate in full committee came as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee separately approved a $14.45 billion foreign-aid bill that would significantly expand on the Bush administration's proposals for aid to Eastern Europe while seeking to curb military aid in El Salvador.    The Overseas Private Investment Corp. would be authorized to back U.S. investment in Poland and Hungary, and the subcommittee added $75 million more for Poland, which would receive the bulk of a total package of more than $100 million for the two countries. The El Salvador issue is sure to be fought on the Senate floor. But the bill parcels out the promised $85 million in military aid in three portions, and establishes a process requiring consultation by the State Department and seeking some leverage over the conduct of the new Salvador regime.    Total spending for foreign assistance remains effectively frozen at current levels; these accounts have borne the brunt of fiscal pressures in recent years. Major differences remain with the House over what priority to give development assistance and, in an effort to stretch available military aid, a provision in the bill has provoked the influential Greek-American lobby.    Military aid to Turkey and Greece would continue to be allocated on a traditional 10-7 ratio, but the bill would now allow the administration to cut back on unobligated funds that have backed up over the years to the two rival countries. Greece, which has failed to spend much of what it has been given, is the more vulnerable and could lose as much as $350 million. Though few anticipate such a large cut, the issue is a sensitive one for the nation, where new elections are expected soon. The same budget pressures can play havoc with domestic policy as well. To buy itself some leeway in funding housing and space programs, the Senate committee agreed to do away with the current cap of nearly $101,000 on Federal Housing Administration residential mortgages and allow the government to insure loans of up to 95% of the median costs of homes in a sales area. The anticipated result will be to stimulate loans and fees collected from borrowers, yielding a short-term gain of $157 million in fiscal 1990 and papering over spending elsewhere. &quot;I wonder if we are making worse law in meeting targets,&quot; said Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), the ranking minority member of the Senate Budget Committee. &quot;It is a glaring example of policy driven by budget targets.&quot;    In similar fashion, a backlog of appropriations to fund state claims for aid given new immigrants has become a favorite target for both lawmakers and the Bush administration. An estimated $241 million was reallocated from the account to cover new, more pressing demands in health and human services, and the Senate panel signaled that it would hold a further $320 million in reserve if needed to pay for new funding sought by the president for his anti-drug initiative.    As the Senate moves through its appropriations bills, the impact is felt in the House, which wrestled yesterday with a rider attached by Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) setting new restrictions on funding by the National Endowment for the Arts. In heated language, conservatives demanded a vote to show support of Mr. Helms's amendment. But the House Appropriations Committee leadership sidestepped the issue by offering a substitute resolution focusing on a separate Senate amendment requiring the disclosure of paid consultants who lobby on behalf of federal grants.    By a 264-153 margin, the Democratic-controlled chamber supported the panel, and the upshot is to further increase the likelihood of both houses accepting sweeping changes in disclosure rules covering those who lobby the executive branch. Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) yesterday expressed his support of the requirements, first proposed by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) largely in response to the influence-peddling scandals at HUD. </TEXT></DOC>
