One of the last true communist parties left in the West,the French party has kept close ties to its Soviet bigbrother. The French party took an embarrassingly soft line onthe coup, failing to condemn it clearly. Now tensions betweenthe party's reformers and hard-liners have broken into openwarfare. The future is in doubt for a party that was sostrong here in 1946 -- when it won nearly 30% of thelegislative vote -- that many feared it would seize power.</LP><TEXT>   Initially, the French party didn't condemn the coupitself, it just criticized the &quot;conditions&quot; under which itwas carried out. Some party insiders charge that hardlineparty leader Georges Marchais, who considers MikhailGorbachev too liberal, didn't want to criticize the coup atall, but was forced to by reformers. Now Mr. Gorbachev hasvirtually shut down his own Communist Party, and that maymark an end to the grip that Mr. Marchais, who is 71 yearsold, has held on the French party since 1972.   Party reformers want to go the way of parties likeItaly's, which no longer calls itself Communist. Some formermembers of the French party go further, insisting that evenreformers can't save it. &quot;This is the end of the role thatcommunism has played in world history,&quot; former FrenchCommunist Party spokesman Pierre Juquin said.   But many French Communists insist that their party stillhas a future, even if the Soviet party dies. Reformers andhardliners alike say France can build its own brand ofcommunism that won't make the same mistakes Soviet Communistsdid. But that idea is getting less and less support here.   As recently as 1979, Communists won more than 20% of thevote in an election here for the European parliament. But bythe 1989 European parliamentary election, Communists hadfallen to just 7.9% in France. Polls suggest the party wouldfare far worse today.   Reflecting the open rebellion within the French party, agroup of nine liberal central committee members released aletter demanding a special central committee meeting to dealwith the crisis. They said the party is suffering from &quot;anoutdated vision of the world.&quot; Signatories included three ofthe four Communists who served as government ministers in theearly 1980s, before the Communists broke with theSocialist-led government.   Their target is Mr. Marchais. Reformers say they believeMr. Marchais privately sympathized with the coup plotters.Signs are that his stance hasn't softened, which couldpresage a bitter internal struggle. Since the coup's failure,Mr. Marchais has insisted that he always opposed it, and hehas applauded Boris Yeltsin's role. But he added in aninterview with a French newspaper that &quot;on the Frenchpolitical scale, {Mr. Yeltsin} would be placed on the rightwing.&quot;   Other party hard-liners were quoted in the French press asaccusing President Bush of &quot;meddling&quot; in internal Sovietaffairs during the attempted coup. They reportedly accusedMr. Yeltsin of taking orders directly from Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
