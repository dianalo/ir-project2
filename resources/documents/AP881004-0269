On other markets, coffee prices fell further; gold pricesrallied; oil prices reversed their decline; live cattle and hogprices gained; and feeder cattle and pork bellies were mostly lower.   Soymeal remains the underlying strength in the soy market, andhelped soybean prices close sharply higher, said Joel Karlin, ananalyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago.   Domestic demand remains high for soymeal, and tight supplies aswell as an anticipated increase in exports helped keep prices firm,he said.   Export demand also encouraged buying in the corn pit, Karlinsaid.   Wheat settled \ cent to 2\ cents higher, with the contract fordelivery in December at $4.22{ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to4{ cents higher, with December at $2.94{ a bushel; oats were 1{cents lower to 1 cent higher, with December at $2.49\ a bushel; andsoybeans were 11 cents to 13{ cents higher, with November at $8.28a bushel.   At New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange, coffee pricescontinued to feel pressure from the International CoffeeOrganization's compromise plan for 1988-89.   The plan, which includes an initial export quota of 58 millionbags, allows concessions for producers of mild coffee _ the kindtraded at the New York exchange _ and is expected to increaseavailability, said Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill LynchCapital Markets Inc. in New York.   The plan announced over the weekend calls for a 2-million-bagreduction, but traders had expected a quota of around 54 millionbags, Badenhop said.   Coffee settled 1.89 cents to 6 cents lower, with the contractfor delivery in December at $1.244 a pound.   Gold futures prices were higher and silver was mostly higher atthe New York Commodity Exchange.   Both responded to the higher crude oil price, which had beendown sharply for several days, said Bette Raptopoulos, a metalsanalyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.   The dollar's weakness and the gains in grains and soybeans _both causing a rise in inflationary expectations _ also supportedgold prices, she said.   Gold was 30 cents to 60 cents higher, with October at $398.10 atroy ounce; silver was .1 cent lower to .2 cent higher, withOctober at $6.248 an ounce.   Crude oil futures steadied in trading at the New York MercantileExchange following their plunge the previous two sessions. Butanalysts said concerns about oversupply remained the underlyingfactor in the market, and that helped temper gains.   Crude oil settled 1 cent to 32 cents higher, with the contractfor delivery in November at $13.07 a barrel; heating oil was .59cent lower to .39 cent higher, with November at 38.17 cents agallon; and unleaded gas was .87 cent lower to .10 cent higher,with November at 41.11 cents a gallon.   Live cattle and hog prices rallied, while feeder cattle and porkbellies were mostly lower.   Higher cash bids from meatpackers for live cattle and hogssparked a buying spree in the cattle and hog pits, and had aspillover effect on pork belly prices through the middle part ofthe session, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst for Shearson LehmanHutton Inc. in Chicago.   But ``early buyers turned out to be late sellers,'' he said, andprofit-taking later near the session's close eased earlier gains.   Live cattle settled .07 cent to .50 cent higher, with thecontract for deliver in October at 72.42 cents a pound; feedercattle were .42 cent lower to .25 cent higher, with October at82.15 cents a pound; hogs were .23 cent to .67 cent higher, withOctober at 39.87 cents a pound; and pork bellies were .37 centlower to .93 cent higher, with February at 49.95 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
