The proposed cuts, filed with the Federal Communications Commission, reflect proposed reductions in ATandamp;T's costs to connect to the local phone companies and are larger for business customers than for residences. But the size of those reductions is in dispute. ATandamp;T said that if the FCC doesn't resolve the dispute in its favor, its proposed rate cut would be lowered to $200 million, or less than 1%, reflecting reductions already proposed by the local phone companies.    The latest proposal represents the first time ATandamp;T has tried to enlist public sentiment for its campaign to get the local phone companies to charge increasingly lower fees to connect to their networks. ATandamp;T has complained for some time to the FCC that the local companies, primarily the Bell telephone concerns it divested in 1984, haven't been reducing their connection costs enough.    &quot;We wanted to file (rates) that reflect the difference of opinion between us and the Bells so people could understand the implications of the structural changes&quot; being proposed by the Bells, Larry Garfinkel, vice president, marketing services, said.    &quot;I would prefer not to comment on (the) word 'piggy,'&quot; Mr. Garfinkel said, in describing the Bells' attitude about connection costs. &quot;I think there are honest differences of opinion between us.&quot; For instance, ATandamp;T believes long-distance usage will grow between 12% and 13% next year, compared with the Bells' belief that growth will be below 8%, he said.    Long-distance phone companies have been grumbling that one reason the Bells have shown such healthy earnings growth since 1984 is that their connection charges are set much higher than their costs. Besides understating long-distance growth, Mr. Garfinkel said ATandamp;T believes the Bells have been charging the costs of their unregulated businesses to their regulated local phone-service businesses. Last year, ATandamp;T said it paid the Bells $19.5 billion in connection charges, representing between 25% and 30% of each Bell operating company's revenue, depending on the company.    Dennis Eidson, a division manager at Southwestern Bell Corp. said he questioned ATandamp;T's numbers. &quot;We have followed the FCC rules and in my view the (connection) charges have been cost supported and have been coming down over time,&quot; Mr. Eidson said. &quot;We don't feel there is any cross subsidization.&quot;    A Pacific Telesis Group spokeswoman said the company knows ATandamp;T thinks its connection costs are too high, &quot;but we stand by what we filed&quot; with the FCC. She said the company expects the FCC to resolve the dispute by the end of next month.    Competitors would presumably have to match ATandamp;T's proposed rate cuts if the FCC approves them. US Sprint Communications Co. said it probably would continue to set its rates lower than those of ATandamp;T, but that it couldn't respond to the ATandamp;T proposal until it knows how the FCC will rule on the connection-charge issue. US Sprint is a joint venture of GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.    MCI Communications Corp., Washington, said it supports ATandamp;T's move. &quot;We do agree with ATandamp;T that access charges are far too high,&quot; a spokeswoman said. As far as rates are concerned, MCI intends to &quot;remain competitive,&quot; the spokeswoman said, but she added that it is too early to say what rate actions the carrier will take.    Mr. Garfinkel said ATandamp;T is &quot;confident&quot; that the FCC will be sympathetic to ATandamp;T's viewpoint and force the local phone companies to substantially reduce their connection charges.    Industry analysts said the proposed rate cuts also should generate sympathy at the FCC and in Congress for proposals to lessen regulation of ATandamp;T, because the proposed cuts show ATandamp;T's willingness to continue cutting rates. Mr. Garfinkel said ATandamp;T won't file for a rate increase as a result of its recent request to the FCC to substantially boost ATandamp;T's depreciation expenses.    ATandamp;T wants to replace the current method of profit regulation with a cap on its prices, to be set at whatever level is in effect when the new regulation takes hold. Analysts believe the regulatory change will allow the company to earn more, because it will have a greater incentive to cut costs.    The company has proposed increases in rates for calls that go only short distances. Yesterday, it asked for an additional $128 million annual rate rise for customers that use special phone lines to connect to the Bells and, in turn, to ATandamp;T lines for dedicated voice and data lines. That increase reflects higher charges by the local phone companies for such special lines, ATandamp;T said.    Besides generating sympathy for lessened regulation of ATandamp;T, the company's proposed rate decrease illustrates the company's desire to remain competitive with other carriers wooing business customers, said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. The proposed cuts are far larger for services business customers use than for those used by residential customers.    For instance, regular long-distance rates would be cut by 6.3% during the day but only by 2.2% during the evening and 0.8% during the night and on weekends, ATandamp;T said in its proposal.    The company also proposed rate reductions of 2.9% for &quot;800&quot; service customers, 4.4% for WATS customers, 6.3% for its Megacom 800 service and 5.9% for is regular Megacom service, and an overall rate cut of 5.4% on its Software Defined Network service.    Also, rates on ATandamp;T's International Plus calling plan would be reduced so that customers making international calls will find the plan attractive if they make $120 a month in international calls, ATandamp;T said. Currently, customers spending $250 a month or more in international calls find the International Plus plan attractive.    ATandamp;T also said that, combining all the rate increases and decreases proposed thus far, next year it would probably earn a 9.7% return on its interstate investment in its phone network. Current FCC rules allow it to earn up to 12.7%. But Mr. Grubman said regulatory returns don't always reflect what the company reports in earnings to the financial community. In addition, he said, given ATandamp;T's current robust long-distance earnings, &quot;I have a hard time believing ATandamp;T will earn only 9.7% next year.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, ATandamp;T shares closed at $28.625, down $87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
