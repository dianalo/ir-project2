(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sudden thunderstorm dumped almost 4inches of rain in two hours, killing two children who were sweptaway after a surge of water toppled a van on a city street,officials said.   About 400 people were evacuated, some in boats, and lightningcaused scattered power outages as the storm pounded thissoutheastern North Carolina city of 60,000 Friday evening.   Fear of more rain today prompted officials to call in crews toprepare sandbags, and divers, dogs and soldiers from nearby FortBragg helped in the search for other possible victims.   ``The showers turned to a deluge and they just wouldn't stop,''said police spokesman Jason Brady.   Nichole Pifer, 6, and Jamie Childress, 4, drowned after they werehit by a wave as they were trying to get out of a van that tippedover on a street, Brady said. The other occupants of managed toescape the the nearly submerged vehicle.   ``We do have search and rescue teams checking to see if there areany more missing people,'' Graham Wilson, spokesman for the statepublic safety agency, said today. ``We're not anticipating any moredeaths at this point, but we think we do have some peopleunaccounted for.''   Some cars were still stranded in water up to their roofs thismorning.   ``Just a few minutes ago, they pulled a car out of some waterthat had two people in it,'' Brady said this morning. The two werenot injured.   He said officials and residents this morning were preparing formore rain.   ``We've got more people coming in to prepare sandbags andenvironmental services folks are coming in to unclog the drains, andbuses are coming in for possible evacuation procedures,'' he said.   Police used city buses to evacuate residents living in ahalf-mile radius of Glenville Lake, as water spilled over the lake'sdam. Streets and bridges were damaged by the high water, Brady said.   Emergency shelters were set up at the Fayetteville Central FireDepartment, the National Guard Armory and a church, officials said.   In Raleigh, James Brackett of the National Weather Service saidweather officials did not issue a flood warning until just after 9p.m., an hour after the storm began.   ``We had expected the thundershowers which were forecast,''Brackett said. ``The flooding was totally unpredictable.''   William Henning, the manager of Hillsboro Taxi, said Friday nightthat there was two feet of standing water in his office building,and other area buildings were flooded.   ``The phones are ringing off the hook, but we can't floatnowhere,'' Henning said. ``We are getting all kinds of business, butwe just can't do nothing.   ``If we had a boat, we'd be in pretty good shape,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
