It has been theoretically demonstrated that phenomenaof such flow are essentially different from those of isothermal watermovement. Other findings are as follows: According to the results ofsoil evaporation process experiments concerning non-isothermal seepageflow, Philip and De Vries's theory well explains phenomena, but involvemany parameters so that it is necessary fo fix these parameters. As faras phenomena are concerned, the effect of heat of vaporization is highin the capillary band, and the characteristics concerning water contentare considerably different from those in the case of isothermal condition.The relationship between the coefficient of specific permeability andvolume water content in the process of water discharge can be explainedto some extent by a theoretical model in which temperature is used asa parameter. Extensive experimental study seems necessary to put thefindings obtained here into practical use. (7 figs, 17 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
