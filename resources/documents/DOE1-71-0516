However, nationaleconomists should think along new lines: The authors advocate an ecologicalcalculation in national economy which also considers the ecological andsocial consequential cost of economic systems. We need to start changingthe total energy system qualitatively by rational energy utilization,by the application of ecologically compatible solar energy and by neworganizational forms of energy supply structure before the ecologicaldamage caused by our linear, open-ended energy systems with their wasteproducts will have reached a state beyond repair.</TEXT></DOC>
