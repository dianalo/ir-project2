The distance modulus of the galaxy, independentlydetermined by the redshift and the Tully-Fisher (1977) relation, is 32.3+ or - 1.0. The maximum brightness of SN 1987D was V about 13.2 and occurredon April 18, 1987, + or - 4 days; the absolute luminosity is about 0.6mag brighter than the average for SNe Ia. The spectrum of SN 1987D istypical of SNe Ia, but the expansion velocity (9600 km/s) is considerablylower than average. 23 references.</TEXT></DOC>
