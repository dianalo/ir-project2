Mr. Peterson spoke to reporters after Canada's 10 provincial premiers received a lengthy briefing on the talks by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his chief trade negotiator, Simon Reisman.    Mr. Peterson said specific issues had been dropped from the negotiations, but he declined to elaborate. However, he said the U.S. last Friday gave &quot;formal notice&quot; that it wants to discuss auto trade as part of the negotiations. Mr. Peterson reaffirmed that Ontario will oppose any changes that will adversely affect the province's big auto trade with the U.S.    Mr. Reisman disagreed with Mr. Peterson's assessment. The negotiator told reporters after the meeting, &quot;If we make a deal it will be the largest bilateral trade agreement ever negotiated in the history of trade agreements.&quot;    The negotiations, which were proposed by Canada in September 1985, aim to dismantle trade barriers between the U.S. and Canada, which carry on more trade than any other two countries.    Mr. Mulroney, who appeared subdued, told reporters several times there &quot;is no guarantee&quot; that Canada can reach a satisfactory agreement with the U.S. He said there are still &quot;many important stumbling blocks,&quot; including a mechanism for settling trade disputes. Such a mechanism is an &quot;essential&quot; Canadian requirement in the negotiations.    The prime minister said the provincial leaders expressed their continuing support for the negotiations. The two countries have only three weeks to reach a pact if they are to meet a deadline set by the U.S. Congress. The premiers will meet at least one more time to review the status of the negotiations.    Canada's federal government needs the support of the provinces because of their jurisdiction over key trade issues such as liquor and beer sales. </TEXT></DOC>
