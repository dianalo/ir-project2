Investment bankers say the rights offering -- a vehicle bywhich companies distribute new stock only to their existingshareholder base -- promises to become one of Wall Street'shottest items.</LP><TEXT>   On Wednesday, Occidental Petroleum, which had long beentrying to sell its 51% stake in IBP on the private market,changed course and disclosed that it would distribute its IBPstake to its own holders via a $360 million rights offering.Oxy's move quickly follows a massive $2.76 billion rightsoffering by Time Warner.   And with the merger market cool and the market fortraditional stock offerings becoming saturated, more suchdeals may be on the way. &quot;I think you're going to see more ofthem {rights offerings} as long as the stock market hangs inthere,&quot; says David Wittig, co-head of mergers at SalomonBrothers Inc. &quot;A rights offering can make a lot of sense,&quot; arival investment banker adds, especially if the company hasto &quot;do something painful,&quot; such as selling stock at adepressed price.   Analysts were quick to point out that Oxy's offer differsfrom Time Warner's. Oxy is giving its holders the right tobuy stock of another company, meatpacker IBP, for $15 ashare. (The holders get the right to buy a single IBP shareat this price for every 13 shares they own of Oxy). TimeWarner, on the other hand, was distributing its own stock asa means of raising capital. &quot;Oxy is very different from TimeWarner,&quot; says John Roberts, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.   Yet in the essentials they aren't so very different. BothOxy and Time Warner resorted to rights offerings as a meansof reducing their debt. And Time Warner first attempted toraise capital by finding joint venture or investmentpartners. Thus, for both Oxy and Time Warner, a rightsoffering was a last resort.   The stock market greeted Oxy's move coolly, sending sharesof IBP into a 16% tailspin on heavy volume. They closed at$16, down $3, on volume of more than 3,011,500 shares.   One major depressant for IBP's shares was a stampede outof the stock by people who had been looking for a takeover.Speculators who'd been betting on an outright sale of theDakota City, Neb., beef and pork processor -- the world'slargest producer of red meat -- gave up hope and bailed out.   Also, there is fear of an &quot;overhang&quot; of IBP stock, saysJohn Curti, an analyst with Securities Corp. of Iowa. Thatis, once Oxy holders get their hands on IBP stock, many areapt to sell it. &quot;Shareholders have been pressing the companyto sell IBP in the first place,&quot; he says, &quot;so why would theywant to own IBP individually?&quot;   In theory, at least, a rights offering is a controlled wayof dispersing large amounts of stock, in a mannerspecifically intended to avert big sell-offs. Rightsofferings have fallen into disuse in the U.S. since the early1970s. Since then, according to Philip Keevil, head ofinvestment banking in the New York office of S.G. Warburg andamp;Co., a British securities firm, companies have preferred tospin off shares of certain subsidiaries -- essentially givingthem away to holders as a dividend -- or to do &quot;fullydistributed equity offerings to new holders, because theybroaden your equity base.&quot;   At Oxy, a spinoff was ruled out because it wouldn't haveproduced any cash for Occidental. And a conventional stockoffering, Mr. Keevil says, &quot;would have tanked the stock&quot; evenmore than did the rights-offering plan.   But the extent of yesterday's stock slide apparentlysurprised Oxy, as well as underwriters First Boston andDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. And should IBP's shares fall atleast $1 more -- to hit or dip below $15 by Sept. 27, whenthe offering expires -- the rights presumably wouldn't beexercised. In that case, Oxy's underwriters First Boston andDLJ have committed to buying 75% and 25%, respectively, ofany stock that isn't distributed.   People familiar with the situation say DLJ had been tryingto sell the meatpacking company for about nine months, butthat during that time beef prices soared, squeezing IBP'sprofit margins. (The company had a loss of $19.8 million inthe first half of 1991, compared with net income of $20.2million in the first half of 1990 and a $42.3 million profitfor the full year.)   After initially seeking prices in the mid- to high-20s,Occidental is believed to have received two expressions ofinterest from U.S. companies in the upper teens to low 20s,as well as some interest from foreign buyers in partialstakes. But by the time Oxy went back to the U.S. bidders,they had retreated. In late spring, First Boston, whichhadn't been working on the sale effort, first proposed arights offering.   One analyst speculated that both firms might have beeneager to do the deal because Occidental is a big investmentbanking customer. For First Boston, which hasn't done muchbusiness for Oxy in the past, the rights offering was a footin the door. And for DLJ, it was a way of making up for thedisappointing sale attempt.   The rights themselves, which began trading yesterday, havean intrinsic value of $1 based upon yesterday's closing priceof $16. But yesterday the rights closed well above that, at$1.50 -- suggesting that the underwriters had been buyingrights for their own account.   The underwriters can afford to pay more than others forthe rights because of the way they are compensated. Theinvestment firms will get fees of 29 cents a share, or $7million, about 2% of the deal, for committing to buy thestock. In addition, they get a discount of 58 cents a share,for shares they actually acquire. If they had to buy all 24million shares, the additional fee would amount to $13.9million.   Some analysts were surprised that Occidental had opted tosell at a time when the meat-production business isdepressed, but showing some signs of recovery. &quot;They got thelow end of the range,&quot; says Mr. Roberts of Merrill Lynch.   But a rights offering was, in effect, a reasonablecompromise between Oxy's two needs -- to unload the asset,and to get a decent price.   &quot;If you're anxious to `monetize' the asset and you don'twant to let it go on the cheap,&quot; says Bryan Jacoboski, ananalyst at PaineWebber, &quot;this at least gives Oxy's ownshareholders the chance of benefiting&quot; if IBP's stock riseslater on. &quot;If they had sold it to a leveraged buy-out firmand {the LBO firm} had resold it at $25 a share a year fromnow, Oxy would have looked foolish.&quot;   Oxy said in a statement that the rights offering allowsits stockholders &quot;to benefit in the long-term potential ofIBP stock, and furthers Oxy's goal of restructuring anddivesting non-core&quot; assets. Also, it said, &quot;this vehicleassured Occidental a completed sale.&quot;   But analysts were divided on whether to recommend that Oxyholders hang on to IBP. Ronald Baron, a New York moneymanager, rushed in yesterday to buy the stock, arguing thatthe dip is the product of a short-term market reaction. &quot;Thecompany has been adding facilities. It has the potential toincrease {profit} margins. Supplies of beef are turningaround,&quot; in IBP's favor.   IBP's peak earnings, in 1987, were $67.9 million. At $15 ashare, the company thus would be valued at about 10.5 timespeak earnings, not especially cheap. But bulls such as Mr.Baron say IBP has the ability to earn much more.   In a commodity business, though, earnings are notoriouslyhard to predict, notes Ronald Strauss, an analyst at WilliamBlair. And Steve Kay, editor of Cattle Buyers Weekly, says hedoubts that IBP will earn much more than $1.50 a share evennext year. &quot;We have continuing overcapacity and tight cattlesupplies,&quot; he says. For IBP's industry to show muchimprovement, &quot;we have got to see quite a shakeout&quot; in themeatpacking business.</TEXT></DOC>
