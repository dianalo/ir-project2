McMullen andamp; John F. McMullen, 9/21/90andM;Summary: Computer Ethics is an excellent 193-page book which deals with thesocial, legal and moral issues surrounding the evolving use of computers onour society.andM;REVIEWandM;In just the last year, we have seen New Jersey's &quot;Computergate&quot; case in whicha Republican aide allegedly electronically broke into a state computer systemthat was reportedly used by the Democratic legislators, the &quot;worm&quot; that shutdown a major computer network, the arrest of Robert Morris for planting theworm and his subsequent trial and sentencing, Apple's &quot;look andamp; feel&quot; suitsagainst Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, the publishing of Clifford Stoll's&quot;The Cuckoo's Egg&quot; which recounted his tracking down of an espionage ringthat was infiltrating military and research networks, Lotus' victory in itssuit against Paperback Software and its immediate filing of a similar suitagainst Borland and SCO, the picketing of Lotus by the League for ProgrammingFreedom in opposition to Lotus' position on &quot;ownership&quot; of user interfaces,Secret Service raids and confiscation of computers belonging to so-called&quot;hackers&quot; and on and on.andM;Papers like the Washington Post and the New York Times position stories suchas the ones mentioned with major news or business stories while articles onnew word processing programs or smaller laptops are usually relegated to aweekly special computer section.andP;  It is safe to say that such editorialdecisions reflect the interests of the readership; the &quot;sexier&quot; stories aremore interesting to the general public than the purely technical.andM;While the computer crime and litigation stories may excite or titillate thegeneral public, the issues underlying them must be of concern to the computerestablishment.andP;  Such heady questions as &quot;what is intellectual property?&quot;,andO;&quot;what is the responsibility of software developers if their software doesn'twork?&quot;, &quot;what privacy rights must the &quot;hacker&quot; respect?&quot;, are technical onlyin that they deal with technological items; they deal, rather, with legal andeven moral issues.andP;  There have, unfortunately, been very few books thatprovide any guidance in these areas or even any in-depth discussion of theissues.andM;To fill this void we now have Computer Ethics: Cautionary Tales and EthicalDilemmas in Computing by Tom Forester and Perry Morrison (The MIT Press,1990; $19.95).andM;In the words of the authors, &quot;The aim of this book is two-fold: (1) todescribe some of the problems created for society by computers and (2) toshow how these problems present ethical dilemmas for computer professionalsand computer users.&quot;andM;Forester and Morrison are both instructors at Australian universities(Forester at the School of Computing and Information Technology at GriffithUniversity and Morrison at the University of New England) and this bookevolved, from &quot;our experience teaching two courses on the human and socialcontext of computing to computer science students at Griffith University.&quot;andM;(NOTE: Readers of this review should not assume that the authors' Australianroots make this an &quot;Australian book.&quot; Examples abound throughout the work ofincidents that have occurred in the United States and there is an Appendixthat focuses on the technological issues relating to the Strategic DefenseInitiative.)andM;The authors' experiences in these classes have led them to feel that theinclusion of computer ethics courses within computer science curriculum is anecessity.andP;  With that aim in mind, this work was designed to be useful as atext in such a course and, therefore, contains an abundance ofbibliographical material.andM;It should not be assumed that the author's desire to make this work useful asa college text means that Computer Ethics is as dry as books of that genreoften are.andP;  Nothing is further from the truth.andP;  Computer Ethics might bedescribed as an anthology of individual articles on issues particularlyrelevant to current news The chapter titles -- Computer Crime, SoftwareTheft, Hacking and Viruses, Unreliable Computers, The Invasion of Privacy, AIand Expert Systems, Computerizing the Workplace and the aforementionedAppendix, Autonomous Systems: the Case of Star Wars -- bear out thepertinence of the topics addressed by Computer Ethics.andM;Each chapter provides a well-described example of a situation relating to thespecific topic under consideration and then discusses the various aspects ofthe topic, often bringing in additional examples.andP;  The chapters each contain,as conclusions, a &quot;Suggestions for Further Discussion&quot; section which lays outa hypothetical situation relating to the topic for discussion and analysis.andO;Bibliographic notes and reference material follow each chapter.andM;The chapter on &quot;Hacking and Viruses&quot; is particularly timely and is to becommended as it does not overly simplify the issues involved.andP;  Those whorightly insist that the word &quot;hacker&quot; should not be considered synonymouswith computer criminal will be happy to see that Forester and Morrison useSteven Levy's fine book &quot;Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution&quot;(Doubleday, 1985) as a reference and trace the history of &quot;hacking&quot; back tothe Massachusetts Institute of Technology late 1960's.andP;  (They also quote theseven definitions of hackers found in Guy Steele's &quot;The Hacker's Dictionary).andM;Those, however, who blindly defend any activities of so-called &quot;hackers&quot; willbe less than pleased when they encounter the authors' description of the useof other's telephone credit cards as &quot;criminal acts.&quot; All in all, we foundthis section an extremely well balanced presentation of the issues involvedwith this topic.andM;We think that this is an important work and should cause computer users topause and look beyond the narrow purview of their monitors.andP;  Computertechnology has brought great benefits to our society; it has also brought anumber of new problems which too many computer users tend to ignore.andO;Computer Ethics: Cautionary Tales and Ethical Dilemmas in Computing by TomForester and Perry Morrison forces us to at least consider these issues --and it does it in a well-written, refreshing manner.andM;PUMA RATINGSandM;PERFORMANCE/PRICE: 4.andP;  The authors of Computer Ethics attempt to introducethe reader to the ethical issues surrounding the use of computers in oursociety and, in our judgement, succeed very well.andP;  They also provide anexcellent list of sources for those wishing to delve further into the topics.andM;USEFULNESS: 4.andP;  We find the subject matter extremely important and,therefore, the work is certainly a useful addition to the computerist'sbookshelf.andM;AVAILABILITY: 4.andP;  Available at large retail chains and from computer storeswith book sections.andM;(Barbara E.
