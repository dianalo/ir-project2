L. 95-396, 92 Stat.819; 7 U.S.C. 136).The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated,and it was determined that establishment of the temporary tolerance willprotect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has beenestablished on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance withthe experimental use permit and with the following provisions:1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceedthe quantity authorized by the experimental use permit.2. ICI Americas, Inc., must immediately notify the EPA of any findingsfrom the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company mustalso keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on requestmake the records available to any authorized officer or employee of theEPA or the Food and Drug Administration. This tolerance expires June 10, 1989. Residues not in excess of this amountremaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity after this expirationdate will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally appliedduring the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimentaluse permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may be revoked if theexperimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientificdata on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protectthe public health.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 610-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
