Statistics released by the American Petroleum Instituteafter the close of trading Tuesday showed a huge decline ingasoline stocks of 4.5 million barrels to 211.9 millionbarrels. &quot;Stocks haven't been that low at this time of theyear since at least 1986,&quot; said Michael Rothman, seniorenergy analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.</LP><TEXT>   Gasoline for April delivery increased by 1.83 cents agallon to settle at 72.31 cents. However, the price of crudeoil for May delivery and the price of April heating oildeclined, reflecting lower demand. Production from somerefineries in the U.S. and Europe has been scaled backbecause of maintenance work; therefore, less crude is needed.And demand for heating oil is slipping as winter wanes inmost of the Northern Hemisphere.   In recent weeks, gasoline has been the focus of attentionas traders have questioned whether there will be enough ofthe product to meet motorists' demands. Inventories haven'tgrown, partly as a result of the Persian Gulf war. Refinerieswere trying to make as much distillate as possible ratherthan scaling up the manufacture of gasoline as they typicallydo toward the end of winter. Jet fuel, badly needed for theallied war effort, was processed from the distillate portionof crude oil.   According to Mr. Rothman, damage to Middle Eastern exportrefineries, which typically supply the European and Asianmarkets with gasoline, has also been a concern. Another worryhas been the shutdown of Brazilian refineries during a recentthree-week period because of an oil workers' strike. Brazilhas a refining capacity of 700,000 barrels a day. Much of itsgasoline output is exported.   But Alan Kurzer, a broker at Gerald Energy, a division ofGerald Financial Group Inc., believes that gasoline pricesmay have reached their peak, at least for the short term.Gasoline cargoes are on their way to the U.S. from Europe.Several may have arrived this week, he says, but the bulk ofthe shipments should be arriving during the next four to sixweeks.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Winds whipping across Kansas, Texasand Nebraska blew wheat futures prices higher, as traders betthat the gusts would erode topsoil and possibly damage thedeveloping crop of hard red winter wheat. The wheat contractfor July delivery rose 4.5 cents to $2.9375 a bushel. Erosioncaused by 75-mile-an-hour winds yesterday is likely to makethe need for rain even more acute in regions that grow winterwheat, analysts said. Grain markets will be watching weatherforecasts closely to determine whether the crop will get themoisture it needs. Soybean and corn futures prices also rose,on a slight increase in foreign demand. The U.S. AgricultureDepartment announced it would allocate $33 million inleftover export bonus credits to the Soviet Union for cornpurchases, which stimulated the market. The corn contract forJuly delivery rose 0.75 cent to $2.575 a bushel, while theJuly soybean contract rose 3.75 cents to $5.835 a bushel.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: The dollar's strength put pressure onfutures prices. After setting a life-of-contract low of$354.50 an ounce during the day, gold for April deliveryrecovered a bit to end at $356.30, down $1.30. July platinumbounced back from its low of the day of $388 an ounce tofinish at $391.40, just 10 cents lower. May silver fell 7.2cents an ounce to $3.835. Analysts and traders tied thedecline in precious metals to the strengthening dollar, whichmakes precious metals denominated in dollars more expensiveto foreign buyers. A strong dollar is also viewed asanti-inflationary, and investors often buy precious metals asinflation hedges. Expectations of lower inflation are alsosupported by weakening commodity prices, as reflected in theCommodity Research Bureau's Futures Index, said JamesKneafsey, president of the institutional moneymanagement firmCambridge Financial Management. The CRB lost 0.35 point toend at 215.95. In addition, the gold market continues to feelthreatened by the prospect of selling by the Soviet Union andMiddle Eastern countries, said Dinsa Mehta, chief bulliontrader at Chase Manhattan Bank. Kuwait has been rumored to beselling gold to pay for postwar reconstruction.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices continued to reflect uncertaintyabout Brazil's plans to support an international quotasystem. After trading as low as 93.25 cents a poundyesterday, May coffee recovered a bit to end half-a-centhigher at 95.40 cents. Prices have been volatile sinceBrazil's announcement last week that it would suspend newexports while considering a return to an internationalprice-support agreement. After the close of trading, Brazilcanceled all coffee export contracts registered on March 21-- the date of the initial announcement -- as aninvestigation continued into alleged speculative purchases ofcoffee futures, AP-Dow Jones reported. Earlier, the economyminister had received a letter from Brazil's Senate seekinginformation about the alleged speculation. Judith Ganes, ananalyst at Merrill Lynch, said there was talk in the marketthat Brazil might shed some light on its policies and quotasthis afternoon. Even if Brazil declares it is in favor of areturn to quotas, it will take months of negotiations, Ms.Ganes said. Esther Eskenasy, an analyst at Cargill InvestorServices, said coffee prices are expected to go higher. Theywere strengthening before the Brazilian news broke last week,she noted, because quality coffee is in short supply. Shesees prices testing 96 cents to 98 cents by early next week.</TEXT></DOC>
