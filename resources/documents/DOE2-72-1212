TheMean annual doses were low. Even the occupational group with the highestexposure (industrial radiographers) recorded an average annual dose ofonly 1.1 mSv. Variation of mean dose with age and sex is discussed. Thedistribution of annual doses deviated significantly from lognormality.There are indications that mean doses and proportion of individuals exceeding15 mSv in a year are falling with time, but it is impossible to excludethe possibility that the first trend arises, from an increase in individualswho record little or no dose. 1986 data were compared with earlier yearsand doses of only a few tens of individuals exceeded 15 mSv in any year.About two hundred had lifetime mean annual doses exceeding 15 mSv; meanlifetime doses of half this group would drop below 15 mSv after 5 dose-freeyears. The necessity for individuals to be designated as classified personsis discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
