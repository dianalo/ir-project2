No pickup</UNK><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mortar, machine-gun and cannon firewas heard in the capital Tuesday night as U.S. tanks and truckloadsof American troops headed toward Panama's military headquarters.   Planes and helicopters were flying over the city.   The movement indicated U.S. forces were attempting to forcePanama's military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out of power.   ABC-TV quoted Panamanian armed forces television as reportingthat the U.S. military had been ordered into action against thePanamanian Defense Forces.   It said gunfire and explosions were heard in the vicinity ofDefense Forces headquarters, where Noriega has offices. Gunfire washeard near the U.S. base Fort Clayton, 6 miles north of the city.   Three young Panamanian soldiers told an Associated Pressreporter in the capital ``There is all kinds of hell loose outthere.''   The reporter saw 24 U.S. tanks and at least four trucks carryingAmerican troops head in the direction of Panamanian Defense Forcesheadquarters.   Troops in olive uniforms ran through the luxury Marriott Hoteland lights in the hotel went out.   Channel 8, television station of the U.S. Southern Command,issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement byunauthorized U.S. personnel was prohibited.   The United States has tried to oust Noriega with economic andpolitical pressure since he was indicted on federal drugtrafficking charges in February 1988. U.S. sanctions have depressedthe economy, but have not budged Noriega, and two coup attempts _most recently in October _ failed to unseat him.   U.S. troops in Panama had been on maximum alert and restrictedto base since a U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed by Panamanians onSaturday in what American officials called an unprovoked incident.   There had been reports all day Tuesday of unusual U.S. troop andmilitary plane movement in Panama and the United States.   The United States maintains 12,000 troops in Panama, atinstallations including Fort Clayton, Fort Amador _ a jointU.S.-Panamanian base across a causeway from the capital and U.S.Southern Command headquarters at Quarry Heights, bordering thecapital to the west.   The Panamanian Defense Forces has 15,000 regular troops butNoriega has also armed citizen ``Dignity Battalians'' of hisloyalists.   Noriega accuses the United States of trying to oust him so itcan renege on 1977 treaties under which Washington is to cedecontrol of the Panama Canal by the end of the century.</TEXT></DOC>
