Cmdr.Wally Bloss, the ship's executive officer.   Bloss described the current situation as ``boring'' for the 100or so battle veterans aboard the Jack Williams, at least comparedwith early 1988 when the gulf ``tanker war'' was at its peak andU.S. warships protecting American-flagged vessels faced constantthreats by Iranian forces.   There have been no reported incidents in the gulf since Iraq andIran agreed to a cease-fire Aug. 20, 1988, ending their 8-year-oldwar. Foreign-flag ships no longer fear Iranian gunboat attacks, andTehran's own ships sail unmolested by Iraqi bombers.   The United States, having cut its gulf-based force from 16 to 10ships, scaled back further this month by deactivating the Hercules,the last of two once-secret barges set up in 1987 as bases for Armyhelicopters and Navy patrol boats to disrupt Iranian mine-layingand raids on commercial shipping.   Like other U.S. ships, the Jack Williams still maintains awartime condition called ``modified Zebra,''' in which watertightdoors and hatches can be sealed off in seconds. Six lookouts areposted at all times, including a special ``mine watch'' on the bowto spot drifting mines.   Precautions also include going to ``general quarters,'' orbattle stations, when entering the ``Silkworm envelope,'' the110-mile Strait of Hormuz within range of Iran's Chinese-madeanti-ship missiles.   Since returning to the gulf in early August for a three-monthtour of duty, the ship based in Mayport, Fla., has had one closecall. A tail rotor failed on Aug. 27, sending a helicopter to thewater before pilots regained control.   Such incidents, though hair-raising, pale next to April 18,1988, when U.S. and Iranian forces engaged in a one-day battle,later called the most important naval surface action involving U.S.warships since World War II.   Two Iranian oil rigs were destroyed and six vessels, includingtwo naval frigates, sunk or damaged in Operation Praying Mantis, aUS. reprisal for the near-sinking of the missile frigate USS SamuelB. Roberts by an Iranian mine.   Iran later acknowledged several dozen casualties. The UnitedStates lost a helicopter gunship and its two-man crew to ``hostileaction'' hours after the fighting ended.   Mementos such as the unit commander's flag and a DefenseDepartment battle citation are displayed in the crew's mess asreminders of the Jack Williams' role, directing air and missilestrikes while dodging what were believed to be at least four ofIran's Silkworm missiles.   The Pentagon later insisted that Iran had not fired anymissiles. It said electronic analysis showed U.S. radar operatorshad misinterpreted the blips of American missiles as hostile.   There is little sympathy for that explanation among the ship'sbattle veterans. Although preferring not to be quoted by name, somesay they remain convinced Silkworms were fired.   Skeptics suggest the truth was concealed because U.S. officialsdecided Iran had been punished enough and feared that fulfilling aprevious vow to retaliate for any Silkworm firings would inflamethe situation.   ``I don't suppose the issue will ever be resolved to everyone'ssatisfaction,'' a senior officer said.   Being in the headlines had led the Jack Williams to expect ahero's welcome at Mayport, but by the time it arrived home twomonths later ``the public had pretty much forgotten'' about PrayingMantis, Bloss said.   ``Except for some local coverage, it was just like any otherhomecoming,'' he said. ``We didn't mind. We were glad to be back.''</TEXT></DOC>
