Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New York lawyer with insider trading in connection with the December 1986 acquisition of most of Waldbaum Inc. by Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co.    This is the second insider-trading case arising from that $287.1 million takeover. Last October, the SEC accused both a relative of Ira Waldbaum, the founder of Waldbaum Inc., and that relative's stockbroker of using inside information to profit from the acquisition.    In the case filed yesterday, the SEC said that on Nov. 23, 1986, the lawyer, Joseph Sierchio, learned from Mr. Waldbaum that the regional supermarket chain, based in Central Islip, N.Y., might be sold. Mr. Sierchio then bought 2,500 shares of Waldbaum for about $25 a share, the SEC said. On Nov. 26, Montvale, N.J.-based Aandamp;P, a grocery store chain, announced a $50-a-share tender offer for Waldbaum.    The SEC said Mr. Sierchio neither admitted nor denied the allegations made in the agency's complaint, which was filed in federal court in New York, but agreed to refrain from future violations of the securities laws. Mr. Sierchio also agreed to give up his profits of about $64,000 in the transaction, including interest, and to pay a fine of about $59,000.    Scott Muller, an attorney for Mr. Sierchio, said his client settled the case to avoid the expense of additional litigation.    Harry Weiss, an assistant director in the SEC's enforcement office, said Mr. Sierchio misappropriated information he learned from having a position of trust with Mr. Waldbaum. The SEC didn't allege wrongdoing by Mr. Waldbaum in this case or the earlier one, he said.    Mr. Waldbaum and officials of Waldbaum couldn't be reached for comment. An Aandamp;P spokesman declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
