The thrift institutions were French Market Homestead, Metairie, La., which had assets of $328 million, and Acadia Savings andamp; Loan Association, Crowley, La., which had assets of $160 million. The two banks were Security State Bank, Roosevelt, Okla., which had assets of $18.1 million, and Security State Bank, Davenport, Okla., which had assets of $9.2 million. The two banks aren't related.    The three offices of French Market Homestead and the five offices of Acadia are to reopen today as newly chartered federal mutual associations using the same names. Both thrifts were state-chartered mutual associations.    Each will have a new board, selected by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and will be operated by Dixie Savings andamp; Loan Association, New Orleans, under a management contract with the Bank Board.    The Roosevelt bank's two offices are to reopen today as branches of another Oklahoma bank company, First National Bank in Altus. The failed bank held $16.1 million in 4,000 deposit accounts.    The sole office of the Davenport bank is to reopen today as a branch of First State Bank, Harrah, Okla. The failed bank held $8.6 million in 1,900 deposit accounts.    A total of 108 banks have failed nationwide this year, 19 in Oklahoma. </TEXT></DOC>
