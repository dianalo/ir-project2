The closely held start-up company said its processinvolves so-called &quot;photolithography&quot; etching techniques usedto make multi-layered computer chips. Conductus added that ithas used the technique to make a simple superconductingelectronic device called a Josephson junction, which is abasic building block for computer logic circuits and otherdevices. Superconductors, which lose resistance toelectricity when cooled, promise faster and smaller computersas well as other advances in electronics.</LP><TEXT>   Various research teams and companies previously havedeveloped prototype Josephson junctions using new &quot;hightemperature&quot; superconductors, which work when cooled withliquid nitrogen. Last month, for example, BiomagneticTechnologies Inc., San Diego, said it had developed a&quot;reproducible&quot; way to make the superconducting junctions.   Conductus claimed its method is the first &quot;reliable andpractical technique for producing high-temperaturesuperconductor Josephson junctions that could easily beextended to a manufacturing process.&quot; The company said itexpects to incorporate the junctions in a commercial productwithin a year.   In a collaboration with the University of California atBerkeley and the federal Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,Conductus said its process has been used to make a&quot;magnetometer,&quot; a device for detecting faint magnetic fields.Randy Simon, Conductus's research director, added that theprocess has been used during the past few days to make achip-like computing device called a &quot;shift register&quot; withmultiple Josephson junctions.</TEXT></DOC>
