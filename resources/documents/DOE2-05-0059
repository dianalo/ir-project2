The higher this cost rises, the more themarket requires designs which have a low energy consumption. A cost calculationtaking into account the forecast increase in energy prices over the next20 years shows that, for a compressor in continuous operation, the energycosts alone make up about 70% of the total costs. Moreover, cooling watercosts amount to 20%. The presumed increase of energy costs, have to betaken into account by the piston compressor manufacturer and combatedby lowering the energy consumption of his product. Since flow lossesin the compressor valves make up a significant part of the total energylosses, investigations aimed at lowering these were carried out. Theresults of these studies are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
