(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kerr-McGee Corp. has resumed productionof a rocket fuel oxidizer, drawing the ire of jittery officialsstill recovering from last week's blast at a similar plant twomiles away.   Officials in this city of 55,000 vowed Wednesday to take legalaction to close the plant until the cause of last week's explosionis determined.   With the shutdown of the plant where the explosion occurred, theKerr-McGee plant is the only one in the nation producing ammoniumperchlorate, a component in the solid rocket fuel used in spaceshuttle and military rockets.   ``We feel absolutely satisfied that it's safe,'' Kerr-McGeespokesman Paul Reed said in Oklahoma City.   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' said Henderson City Manager GaryBloomquist. ``I'm totally amazed that they did it.''   Kerr-McGee ceased production of the rocket fuel component lastWednesday following the series of explosions at the PacificEngineering andamp; Production Co. plant. The explosions killed twopeople, injured 326 and caused an estimated $73 million in damage.   Reed said the production resumed at 4 p.m. Tuesday. He announcedit Wednesday from the company's corporate headquarters in OklahomaCity.   Bloomquist said plant officials notified Henderson Mayor LornaKesterson of the resumption after the night shift had reported forwork at the sprawling industrial complex blocks from the downtown.   Last week's blast at the Pacific Engineering plant, two milesout into the desert, damaged homes and businesses throughout theHenderson and Las Vegas area.   Bloomquist said Kerr-McGee officials last week promised not toreopen until the cause of the explosions was known.   Bloomquist said he had been instructed by city council membersto take legal action to halt the Kerr-McGee operations until theaccident's cause is known.   The city manager said he thought the city could close the plant,and he wanted to do so.   ``I'm very sensitive to the loss of jobs and the loss ofindustry,'' Bloomquist said. ``But I'm more sensitive right now tothe fact that there's a lot of very nervous people living in thiscity.   ``I don't think it's unreasonable for Kerr-McGee to keep thecommitment it made to the people,'' Bloomquist said.   Military officials have expressed concern about the loss of thePacific plant and its impact on the national defense.   Kerr-McGee spokeswoman Annita Bridges said the company would beoperating three shifts, as it was doing prior to last week'saccident.   ``If there is a need to increase capacity, we will do what wecan to meet that need,'' Ms. Bridges said. ``We've looked since theaccident as to what kinds of increases we might be able to make.''</TEXT></DOC>
