Many Madison Avenue skeptics lately have become believers, though, particularly since Walt Disney Co. announced last week that it is throwing the bulk of its 1988 media-buying -- an account that resided for two years with ad giant Young andamp; Rubicam Inc. -- to Western International. The account for 1988 totals more than $100 million.    The addition of Disney, Mr. Holt says, will boost his company's annual billings to more than $500 million, from $410 million in the year ended Sept. 30. And it secures Western International's position among the top buyers of television spot commercial time.    Mr. Holt wants to reach $1 billion, and with a client list now including such corporate heavyweights as Atlantic Richfield Co., Bally Hotels and Times Mirror Co., he believes he's well on the way.    &quot;They buy more efficiently than we've been able to find anywhere else,&quot; says one client, Michael Sitrick, senior vice president, corporate communications, for Wickes Cos.    But for all Western International's growth, some big full-service ad agencies still pooh-pooh the company as a competitor in the media-buying business. Mr. Holt's company might be a threat to &quot;smaller agencies,&quot; says a Young andamp; Rubicam spokesman, but &quot;we're a large agency . . . and we feel we're very effective at media buying.&quot;    Mr. Holt doesn't see ad agencies as his adversaries. In fact, about 85% of his business last year came directly through the midsized and smaller agencies that are cutting costs by hiring outside media-buying services. The rest of his clients are companies such as Disney that create their own &quot;in-house&quot; advertising programs.    &quot;I felt the future was with the ad agencies, not against them,&quot; says the amiable, nattily attired Mr. Holt.    From the beginning, Mr. Holt peddled his service as something of an ad agency co-op that can wrangle lower commercial rates from TV and radio networks and stations because of the sheer volume of time it buys. &quot;We go to the agencies and say, 'How'd you like to combine your dollars with our dollars in getting lower rates?'&quot; says Mr. Holt.    Larger advertising agencies dismiss Western International's rate claims. &quot;If you use a media-buying service thinking you're going to get lower rates than with using an agency, that's absolutely wrong,&quot; says Joseph Ostrow, executive vice president and world-wide media director for Foote, Cone andamp; Belding Communications Inc. in New York. Mr. Ostrow also questions whether clients save by going through an ad agency that uses an outside buying service. &quot;Where is the additional money to support two entities coming from, except the client's hide?&quot;    Unlike ad agencies, media-buying companies don't create advertising. But, like full-service ad agencies, they seek to determine, based on demographics, ratings and other factors, the best place and time for clients to run their ads.    Some clients describe Mr. Holt as a straight-shooter in a business full of slick and sometimes questionable deals.    &quot;I'm a tremendously loyal person,&quot; Mr. Holt says. Loyalty is something he obviously feels strongly about. Several years ago, when he thought a friend had betrayed him, he sent the man a big funeral wreath. &quot;It wasn't a threat,&quot; Mr. Holt says. &quot;But what it said was, 'To me, you don't exist anymore.'&quot;    Mr. Holt talks about his company as a family; employees call him by his first name. The approach may have had its genesis during a brief television acting career he had as a teen-age bit player on &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.&quot;    There, Mr. Holt became friends with David Nelson, who now heads Western International's commercial production unit, Casablanca Productions Inc.    Mr. Holt looks fondly on his &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; days, although he thinks he made a poor actor. After attending the University of Southern California on a baseball scholarship, and toying briefly with the idea of a political career, he decided his street sense and knowledge of human nature was more suited to sales. He worked first as a salesman for a local Los Angeles radio station, then for RKO's radio and television operations.    After forming a media-buying partnership in New York, Mr. Holt returned to Los Angeles to start Western International.    Mr. Holt says he gives 6 1/2 days to Western International each week, often putting in 18-hour days. &quot;I'm the hardest worker I know,&quot; he says. &quot;I know that if I work 12 hours and you work seven, and you're smarter, I'll still win (because) the extra time and effort makes a difference.&quot;    His obsession with work isn't without its costs. Mr. Holt is in the middle of a divorce from his wife of 20 years; he says that the breakup largely stemmed from his commitment to Western International. &quot;I love the business. I love selling,&quot; he says.    Coming from a laborer's family, however, Mr. Holt can't shake a nagging fear of losing it all. &quot;Because I'm insecure and constantly afraid that some day I'll be poor again, I have to keep my fingers on everything.&quot; He adds, &quot;I don't have a need to be rich. I have a need to be secure.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
