Philips, underpressure to boost its sagging financial performance, plans toleave its joint venture with American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo., according to people close to the venture.   An ATandamp;T spokesman said reports last week of Philips'spullout in the Dutch press &quot;are pure speculation at thispoint.&quot; But sources close to the Hilversum, Netherlands-basedventure, ATandamp;T Network Systems International, said Philipswill announce that it is selling its 15% stake in the companywithin the next two weeks.</LP><TEXT>   In Eindhoven, the Netherlands, a Philips spokesmandeclined to comment.   Meanwhile, Telefonica de Espana S.A. , Spain's nationaltelecommunications company, has announced plans to take a 6%stake in the venture, which builds telephone exchanges andtransmission gear for public telephone companies.   Telefonica will pay for its stake by swapping the 20%interest it now holds in another ATandamp;T venture, ATandamp;TMicroelectronica Espana, which designs and builds electronicdevices.   ATandamp;T currently owns 59% of ATandamp;T Network SystemsInternational while Italy's Stet Group owns 20%. After thePhilips pullout, ATandamp;T will own 74% of the company, althoughit is expected to continue to seek European partners.   ATandamp;T Network Systems International is ATandamp;T's primaryoverseas equipment arm. It employs more than 5,000 people anddevelops, manufactures and markets the 5ESS digital switchand assorted transmission gear to foreign phone companies.Sales in 1989 rose 10% to $600 million while profit jumped58% to $15 million.   &quot;Philips's pullout wouldn't be surprising,&quot; said CharlesNichols II, telecommunications analyst at Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. &quot;ATandamp;T had hoped that Philips's presence inelectronics would give it an entre into new markets, butPhilips didn't have a big telecommunications presence inEurope, so ATandamp;T had to go it alone. Plus, Philips is afinancial disaster right now,&quot; he added.   Mr. Nichols said ATandamp;T will probably pay &quot;$60 million to$90 million max,&quot; or no more than one times revenue, forPhilips's remaining 15% stake. He said ATandamp;T remainswell-positioned against European competitors since Italy andSpain, its major partners, are also two of Europe'sfastest-growing telecommunications markets, with combinedplans to spend more than $30 billion over the next five yearsto modernize their phone networks.   Philips is narrowing its focus to improve its performance.Because of heavy restructuring costs, the Dutch companyexpects a loss of about $1.1 billion for 1990.   The sale of its stake in the joint venture wouldn'tinvolve Philips's other telecommunications operations, whichinclude making office switchboards, mobile phone equipmentand modems. But some analysts believe Philips eventually maysell its entire telecommunications business, which employsabout 15,000 people.   The partners, in any case, had drifted apart with ATandamp;Thaving taken over most of the management of the venture morethan two years ago. Philips cut its stake to 40% from 50% in1987 and last year cut it again to 15%, saying it wanted tofocus future investment on its core businesses.   The venture, originally called ATandamp;T-PhilipsTelecommunications, was announced with great fanfare in 1983.But Western European politicians quickly warned that thelinkup between one of Europe's biggest electronics companiesand mighty ATandamp;T would have a disastrous impact oncompetitors.   However, although the joint venture has proved moderatelysuccessful, competitors such as France's Alcatel N.V.,Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson and West Germany's SiemensAG have more than held their own.   On Friday, ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen and TelefonicaChairman Candido Velazquez opened a new ATandamp;T Network Systemsplant to build 5ESS switches, in Tres Cantos, Spain, about 10miles north of Madrid.   An ATandamp;T spokesman said it &quot;will take the plant about ayear to get up to speed,&quot; by which time it is expected toemploy about 900 people.   ---   Bob Hagerty in Brussels contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
