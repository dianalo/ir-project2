This time, the focus is on United Technologies' hiring of MelvynPaisley, a former top Navy official who resigned in April, 1987,and began working as a consultant.   United Technologies was among the major defense contractors whoquickly signed up. Paisley had knowledge and access, two ofWashington's most prized commodities.   The latest investigation comes at a time when UnitedTechnologies, the nation's eighth-largest defense contractor, hasregained status as a hot property. Drexel Burnham Lambert saidearlier this year that United Technologies ``will be the best stockto own in the aerospace-defense group in 1988.''   Asked to comment on the investigation, Larry Bingaman, aspokesman for United Technologies, said Saturday: ``We'recooperating fully with the investigation. Because the investigationis ongoing, we can't comment further.''   Based in Hartford, Conn., United Technologies is a conglomeratebuilt during the 15-year reign of the acquisition-minded Harry Gray.   When Gray took over in 1972, the company was known as UnitedAircraft Products Inc., and it was chiefly known for Pratt andamp;Whitney, one of the nation's prime builders of jet engines, andSikorsky, which produces helicopters.   In 1981, Gray, then chairman and chief executive officer, hiredAlexander Haig as the company's president, a move that seemedlogical given the firm's status as a major Pentagon supplier andHaig's background as the former commander of NATO and a topnational security official during the previous Republicanpresidencies.   Haig didn't last long, leaving only a year after he began.   Attempts to reach Haig and Gray were unsuccessful. Neither manreturned calls to his office.   Gray stepped down 18 months ago and was succeeded by Robert F.Daniell, who began a series of layoffs and sales of somebusinesses, moves designed to improve productivity. Daniels'actions have won him praise on Wall Street.   United Technologies' sales rose to $17.2 billion last year,compared to $15.7 billion in 1986; profits zoomed from $73 millionin 1986 to $592 million last year. Earnings per share also rocketedup, from 54 cents in 1986 to $4.52 in 1987.   Part of the overhaul involved Pratt andamp; Whitney, which wasreorganized in an effort to try to reclaim a larger share of themarket in its long-running fight against General Electric, thenation's other major builder of aircraft engines.   That competition is fought on two major battlefields _commercial sales and military contracts.   Last October, Japan Air Lines picked General Electric over Pandamp;Wfor a purchase of new engines and Pandamp;W officials admitted the salewas lost because of Pandamp;W problems in providing timely support forolder-model engines.   The same problem had caused Pandamp;W headaches three years ago in itsdealings with the Air Force, long the largest customer for Pandamp;Wengines.   Pratt andamp; Whitney had been the sole source for engines for theF-15 and F-16 jets, the service's top-of-the-line fighters, butthere were numerous complaints from the service that the companywas too slow to fix problems.   Eventually, the Air Force turned to General Electric and hasgiven GE about half its engine business the past three years.   In 1986, the Justice Department ended a four-year investigationinto charges that Pandamp;W had charged $22 million worth of questionablebillings to the Pentagon from 1979 to 1984.   The allegedly excessive billings covered country clubmemberships, political contributions, private planes, professionalfootball tickets, and even Halloween costumes.   But federal prosecutors decided against bringing charges becausethey said the government regulations were so vague and complicatedthat it couldn't be determined which Pandamp;W expenses were reimbursable.   The firm eventually turned the tables on GE on the Navy'sF-A-18, the plane designed to be the service's top fighter-bomberfor the rest of the century.   GE had been providing engines for the F-A-18, but Pandamp;W, at theNavy's request, built a prototype engine to compete for thebusiness and was eventually approved by the Navy as a secondcontractor.   In the past years, Pandamp;W has won $316 million worth of contractsto build engines for the F-A-18.   At the same time, Pandamp;W also moved in as a second builder ofengines for the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor jet being developed forthe Marines and the Navy. GE had originally been the sole sourcefor V-22 engines.   During the time the decisions were made on those two Navyplanes, Paisley was a top official of the service. He was theassistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineering andsystems.   When he left the Navy, Paisley was hired by United Technologieschiefly as a consultant on Pandamp;W's efforts to sell the 404 engine forthe F-A-18 and the engine for the V-22, according to sources whodeclined to be identified.</TEXT></DOC>
