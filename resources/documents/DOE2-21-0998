This gene was fully sequenced by DNA sequenceanalysis and a report of that work was prepared and submitted for publicationin early November 1985. This represented the culmination of several yearsof research effort by several scientists. A preprint of that work isattached to this report and has been offered by Dr. J.J. Doyle, Dr. MaryA. Schuler and Dr. Jerry Slighton, as well as myself. This paper is acomparison of the alpha prime subunit gene with a similar gene from phaseolusvulgaris, the common garden bean. In this paper we compare the sequencesthat are 5{prime} of the gene, and which would represent the transcriptionalpromoter, as well as the sequences within the structural region of thegene. The sequence paper also compares the amino acid sequence of thesetwo genes with that of other genes from Phaseolus, peas and from soybeans.On the basis of this comparison, we predict evolutionary trends withinthe multigene families which encode these proteins in the various plants,as well as to look at the protein itself to try to predict regions ofthe protein that might have functional significance. All of this workwas done on a prior DOE-BER grant and has simply been reported here forthe first time.</TEXT></DOC>
