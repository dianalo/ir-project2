Speaking at a news conference following a special boardmeeting to assess the Soviet situation, Mr. Attali said, &quot;I'msure that the trend of deep and profound decentralization nowwill be speeded up by events.&quot; He went on to say that thisweek's abortive coup was ultimately foiled by a &quot;wilddecentralization&quot; of people taking to the streets. &quot;Now we'vegot to shape this wild decentralization to organizeddecentralization.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Mr. Attali failed to win board approval forlifting curbs that currently limit the bank's lending andinvestment in the Soviet Union. Under terms hammered out lastyear, the bank's investments and loans to the Soviet Unionfor three years can't exceed the amount of Moscow's paid-incapital, or about $215 million. So far, however, the U.S. andJapanese have taken the position that it's too early toliberalize the restrictions; their opposition thwarts the 85%majority on the board Mr. Attali would need to change thegroundrules.   Mr. Attali's new emphasis on the decentralized future forthe Soviet Union comes as other Western leaders are makingsimilar assessments in the wake of this week's tumultuousevents in Moscow. By rallying public resistance, and bravelyfacing down the hard-liners who had seized power, Russianrepublic President Boris Yeltsin hugely enhanced his ownstanding -- at home and abroad. His role in reversing theillegal coup also improved the standing of all the republics.   Until now, many Western leaders mostly have thrown theirweight toward Soviet President Gorbachev alone, on the beliefthat the troubled superpower might slide into chaos without astrong central government. Voicing what seems to be emergingas a new consensus towards the republics, Mr. Attaliemphasized that &quot;decentralization is compatible withstability.&quot; He pointed to the evolving European Community asa model of how sovereign states can preserve separateidentities, while relying on central institutions to carryout certain economic and regulatory functions.   Mr. Attali said that the EBRD so far has dealt withofficials at all levels of government in the Soviet Union.During the crisis, the bank president wrote to PresidentsGorbachev and Yeltsin, along with the mayors of Moscow andLeningrad. Currently, the EBRD's Soviet projects includeadvising the Soviet State Bank and helping the Moscow Councilfor Privatization.   For the time being, the EBRD staff is likely to be lesstroubled by the overlapping Soviet authorities as by thebank's own limits on lending and investing there. One bankofficial said this week that there are enough potentialprojects already to exhaust this year's limit of about $70million.</TEXT></DOC>
