The Denver District Court jury found United Blood Services notliable for damages on the fourth day of deliberations, one dayafter finding one doctor liable and another free of responsibilityfor the woman's AIDS case.   Lawyers said the case may be the first in the nation in which ajury was asked to decide whether a blood bank could be heldresponsible for supplying contaminated plasma. A 1986 case inCalifornia reached the courtroom but was settled before it went toa a jury.   The Denver jury found no liability on the part of Dr. Edward G.Merritt, a family physician who formerly treated Susie Quintana forAIDS. But it ordered Dr. Donald Kearns, an expert in infectiousdiseases who first tested Mrs. Quintana for AIDS and said her testwas negative, to pay $70,000 in damages.   The jury said Kearns was liable because he failed to stop Mrs.Quintana from exposing her husband to the disease.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread most often throughsexual contact or the sharing of needles or syringes shared by drugabusers. It also can be transmitted through blood or blood productsinfected with the AIDS virus, which damages the body's immunesystem, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.   Mrs. Quintana, 50, and her husband, Chris, 53, of Dolores, wereseeking unspecified damages in their lawsuit, but their attorneyasked for $13 million in damages from the blood bank in closingarguments.   An obviously disappointed Mrs. Quintana left the courtroomwithout comment.   Steve Labensky, attorney for the blood bank, said his clientfelt ``what they were doing was reasonably prudent at the time, andapparently the jurors agreed.''   At one point, the six-member jury had indicated in a note toJudge John W. Coughlin that it could not reach a decision on theblood bank's liability. Coughlin instructed jurors to continuedebating the question.   ``Last night I went home and cried so ...,'' said juror TheresaGonzalez in reference to Mrs. Quintana's illness. ``When I took theoath, I knew I couldn't let that affect me.''   Mrs. Quintana contracted AIDS from a 1983 blood transfusion atSouthwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez, where she was being treatedfor an accidental gunshot wound, according to trial testimony.United Blood Services' facility in Albuquerque, N.M., supplied thetainted blood, court records showed.   During closing arguments in the trial, the Quintanas' attorney,Maureen Reidy Witt, said the blood bank was negligent for failingto properly screen donors and test the blood supply.   She said testing routinely used at the time to determine thepresence of the Hepatitis-B virus in blood could have been usefulin eliminating homosexual blood donors, who belong to a high-riskcategory for contracting both diseases.   However, Douglas Irish, an attorney for the blood bank, saidtests for AIDS in blood were not available until two years afterMrs. Quintana's transfusion.   Mrs. Quintana was healthy from outward appearances at the trial,but doctors said she is undergoing AIDS-related treatment from aphysician in Tucson, Ariz.</TEXT></DOC>
