Foley said that before any action is taken on the pay boosts forjudges and executive branch employees he would wait for a reportthat's expected to recommend a pay increase for Congress.   The report, likely to be completed this summer, is expected tosuggest a ban on speaking fees and other honoraria in exchange forthe pay raise.   ``It may well be that they'll recommend that we phase outhonorariums over a period of years with perhaps an increase over aperiod of years starting in the next Congress for members ofCongress,'' Foley said Monday during a political fund-raiser in NewYork.   ``But in any event, whatever happens, I want to see this Congresspropose and send to the president an increase for judges and forsenior civil servants in the executive branch.''   Foley's comments are the first indication that Congress iswilling to reopen the politically volatile issue.   The House in February, faced with a public outcry, killed a 51percent pay increase for judges, senior executives and legislatorsin what was seen as a major defeat for then-Speaker Jim Wright.   Since the vote, Congress has been pressured to increase thesalary of senior executive branch employees and federal judges,whose salaries traditionally are tied to those of Congress.   With the renewed interest in ethics in Washington, Congress hasbeen considering a ban on speaking fees and other outside sources ofincome.   Judicial and executive branch employees already are forbiddenfrom accepting most speaking fees and other outside income.</TEXT></DOC>
