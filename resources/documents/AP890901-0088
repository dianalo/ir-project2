(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge who once jailed a mother for refusingto turn her two children over to their father removed himself fromthe custody dispute today.   During a 30-minute hearing attended by both parents, JudgeDouglas Gray of Rockingham County Superior Court said charges thathe is biased against Jesse Murabito are ``untrue and unfounded.''   However, ``it's important that, at the beginning of a hearing,litigants believe they will get a fair and unbiased judge,'' Graysaid.   ``I'm very grateful,'' Mrs. Murabito, 40, said afterward. Herlawyers had asked Gray to step aside.   Her ex-husband, Mark Murabito, 34, and his lawyer, RaymondKellett, left the courtroom quickly and refused to comment. Incourt, Kellett urged Gray to stay in the case, citing possibledelays if he didn't.   As the judge in the couple's divorce case in 1986 and 1987, Grayheard _ and rejected _ testimony on allegations that Murabitosexually abused his daughter, now 6. When Mrs. Murabito hid the girland her brother, now 4, to block court-approved visits with theirfather, Gray jailed her for a week.   Early last year, Murabito was charged with felonious sexualassault against his daughter. A superior court jury rejected theallegations, which stemmed from incidents after the divorce.   The day of her ex-husband's acquittal, Mrs. Murabito fled withthe children. With the help of a national underground network set upfor women in her situation, she avoided detection for nine months.   Gray, meanwhile, awarded Mark Murabito legal custody of thechildren.   Mrs. Murabito and the children, living under assumed names, werefound last month in tiny Loma, Mont. Authorities seized the childrenand returned them to New Hampshire, where Gray was to review thecustody dispute.   Before stepping out of the case, Gray today ordered that theMurabitos' children remain in foster care and that each parentcontinue to have supervised visits.</TEXT></DOC>
