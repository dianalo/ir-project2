Weight 62,000 pounds. Previously usedonly for hauling nuclear missiles.   That was one of the offerings Friday at an unusual Red Tag Saleput on by the Soviet Ministry of Defense and several semi-publicorganizations to recoup some of the cold cash spent in the Cold War.   The sale items were military support equipment for themedium-range nuclear missiles destroyed under a 1987 U.S.-Sovietagreement, and they were on the market as part of the Soviet driveto reorient its economy from military to domestic needs.   Items as small as rolls of cable, for as little as $1.85, and asbig as the 12-wheel monster MAZ547-B truck for $49,600 were packedinto an exhibition hall in Moscow's Sokolniki Park, to be sold towhomever comes up with the most money the fastest.   ``We want to learn how this equipment can be used in thenational economy,'' said Yuri Vorontsov, a spokesman for the sale.   One of the sale's organizers, Elvin Kalinin, said more anddifferent equipment might be offered at later sales, depending onthe success of this first one. In the future, the organizers mightalso offer after-sales service, he said.   As many as 100 potential buyers milled around the draftyexhibition hall, among them Gennady Gritsevsky, a departmentaldirector for the government environmental commission, Goskompriroda.   Gritsevsky was looking for a vehicle to turn into a mobileenvironmental laboratory to take to chemical factories, dumps, andelsewhere. He was facing down another green truck, this one with acabin built onto its flatbed.   The starting price was $21,700, but that's not what wasbothering Gritsevsky. It was just too big, even with modificationsthat the government agency figured it could make on its own.   ``You can't use it on the street,'' he said, and then huddledwith one of the organizers who said the Ministry of Defense mighthave something more suitable that it would be willing to sell.   Another organizer who declined to give his name said they couldget several hundred such trucks from the Defense Ministry if theycould sell them.   One of the biggest headaches has been pricing the equipment,Vorontsov said. Although military equipment is very specific andexpensive to manufacture, many of the costs are hidden in theSoviet economy.   They hope demand will drive up the minimum prices marked onwhite cards by each piece of equipment.   Kalinin said that under the 1987 agreement with the UnitedStates scrapping both sides' medium-range nuclear missiles, theSoviet Union is abiding by its agreement to destroy the actualweapons and other equipment.   Trucks, electrical generating equipment, voltage regulators, anda bewildering array of other equipment did not have to bedestroyed. But they are specific enough that the military could notfind another use for it.   Organizers of the sale believe collective and state farms,government groups and even foreigners might be willing to lay downtheir cash and take it all away. The equipment will be there untilDec. 10, when the organizers will decide what to do next.   Money from the sale will be divided between the nationaltreasury, the Defense Ministry to improve living conditions forsoldiers and help some of the 500,000 who are being mustered outunder President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's military reductions. A smallportion of the money will go into a fund to help young scientists.   One of the groups in the exhibition hall was a small delegationfrom Tanzania. Just looking, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
