The reductions in the year starting July 1 -- $696 millionmore than the local companies proposed in April -- apply tothe rates that long-distance companies pay for theorigination and termination of interstate phone calls. TheFCC estimates that interstate-access revenues total about $19billion annually.</LP><TEXT>   An American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. spokesman said thecompany is studying the FCC order and plans to expand the$160 million in rate cuts scheduled to take effect July 1. Hesaid it was too early to say how much of a savings customerswill see, but emphasized that &quot;this means more reductions forconsumers and small businesses.&quot;   Spokesmen for MCI Communications Corp. and UnitedTelecommunications Inc.'s US Sprint Communications unit saidtheir companies would remain competitive with ATandamp;T. In thepast, most access-charge reductions have been passed along tolong-distance customers.   The FCC said its common carrier bureau found thatinaccurate projections of demand and costs would result inexcessive returns for local phone companies. The agencyfigured that by underestimating the likely demand forservice, the local companies would have collected $105million more than they should have.   The bureau slashed more than $289 million in access costsafter finding that many local phone companies forecast&quot;unusually high growth rates in their costs without providingadequate explanation or justification.&quot; It said it cut anadditional $302 million for other inflated costs. Further,the agency said that some phone companies made exorbitantforecasts of depreciation expense.   In an interesting twist, the commission found that severalBell companies had misallocated lobbying expenses tooperating-expense accounts in 1989, wrongly passing onseveral million dollars of lobbying costs to phone-companycustomers. The agency cited Ameritech, BellSouth Corp., NynexCorp. Pacific Telesis Group and Southwestern Bell Corp. Theagency said that although the Baby Bells &quot;are entitled toengage in lobbying, the commission's rules make clear thatassociated expenses must be excluded from rate-making.&quot;   Don Evans, MCI's director-technical regulatory affairs,said, &quot;We're excited that the FCC investigated lobbyingexpenses, but I hope this isn't the end of it,&quot; he said.&quot;This is only the interstate part and only what localexchange carriers admitted to.&quot;   MCI had asked the FCC to investigate whether the Bellcompanies were lobbying Congress at customers' expense.Washington-based MCI made its request earlier this year afterthe Bells earmarked $21 million -- $3 million apiece -- foran enormous campaign to persuade Congress to easerestrictions in the consent decree that broke up the BellSystem. The decree bars the Baby Bells from providing thecontent of information services, manufacturingtelecommunications gear and providing long-distance service.</TEXT></DOC>
