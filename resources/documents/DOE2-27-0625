Forty-two patients with lesions of the knee wereexamined using 1.5 Tesla and flexible surface coils. The findings werecompared with those of arthroscopy, arthrography and, wher possible,with those at surgery. For the evaluation of cruciate ligament injuries,MRI proved to have a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 82% withan overall accuracy of 92%. Thirty-nine cruciate ligaments were correctlyevaluated. Three times a false positive diagnosis was made. Examinationof the menisci was less reliable. Sensitivity was 88% and specificitywas 83% with an overall accuracy of 94%. Fifteen meniscus lesions werecorrectly diagnosed. Three times a false positive and twice a false negativediagnosis was made. Four of the five incorrect diagnoses concerned theposterior horn of the meniscus and three were situated laterally.</TEXT></DOC>
