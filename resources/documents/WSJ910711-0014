Keating Jr. reached an unusualagreement with federal regulators that will allow him toplead the Fifth Amendment in writing without taking thewitness stand in regulatory hearings here.   If the agreement is approved by the judge in the Office ofThrift Supervision hearings, the former chairman of AmericanContinental Corp. may avoid much of the adverse publicitythat would be generated by the drama of repeated refusals toanswer questions.</LP><TEXT>   Lawyers for Mr. Keating had hoped to postpone his decisionon whether to testify until after a lengthy hiatus in thehearings, in which regulators are seeking $130.5 million fromthe Arizona developer and six of his former associates.   &quot;This is a satisfactory resolution to a situation that Idon't believe we should have had to confront at this time atall,&quot; said Stephen C. Neal, a lawyer for Mr. Keating. Mr.Neal said that Mr. Keating reserved the right to testify whenthe proceedings resume.   The break will start on Monday to allow Mr. Keating toprepare his defense in a criminal trial on Californiasecurities fraud charges. That trial is expected to begin onAug. 2 and last for several months.   A refusal to testify under the Fifth Amendment in a civilproceeding such as the OTS hearings won't affect any futurecriminal cases, but Judge Paul J. Clerman could permitadverse inferences to be drawn.   In six days of hearings, the court has heard allegationsthat American Continental improperly funded an employee stockownership plan for workers at its former unit, LincolnSavings andamp; Loan Association. The OTS claims that Mr. Keatingand the others enriched themselves by using the ESOP to buytheir stock at inflated prices.   They are also accused of financing the ESOP with loansguaranteed by Lincoln, in violation of banking regulations.Later, in April 1989, federal regulators seized Lincoln,shortly after its parent filed for protection from creditorsunder federal bankruptcy laws.</TEXT></DOC>
