The maker of medical products and bomb detectors said it expects to report net income for the quarter rose to about $315,000, or two cents a share, from $122,000, or one cent a share. It will report that revenue rose 8.4% to about $5.1 million from $4.7 million, Mr. Wood said.    &quot;It has been an exciting year,&quot; he said. Mr. Wood said that Thermedics is continuing its evolution from a development-stage company to a profitable manufacturer and that several major products won't be big revenue contributors until the second half of this year or 1989. He declined to make specific predictions. Thermedics is 72%-owned by Thermo Electron Corp.    For all of 1987, Thermedics expects to report that net income was about $1.1 million, or eight cents a share, including a $231,000 tax-loss carry-forward, Mr. Wood said in an interview. For 1986, it reported a net loss of $596,000. The company expects to report 1987 revenue of about $20 million, up 26% from $15.8 million the year before.    More than half of Thermedics' revenue came from sales of its Corpak subsidiary, acquired in April 1986. Corpak's major business is selling plastic naso-gastro feeding tubes and pumps.    One reason that Thermedics revenue for the quarter didn't grow rapidly is that year-earlier revenue included sales of about $700,000 by a packaging subsidiary that Thermedics has since closed. &quot;It was a low-margin business that didn't fit the rest of the company,&quot; Mr. Wood said. </TEXT></DOC>
