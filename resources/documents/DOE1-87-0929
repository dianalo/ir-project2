<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0929 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors performed MR imaging on six patients with intracranial hypertension(IIH). The patients were women aged 27 +- 9 years. Nine normal womenvolunteers, aged 34 +- 6 years, were studied for comparison. Lumbar puncturesof the six patients revealed opening pressure ranging from 280 mm togreater than 550 mm (median, 375 mm). partially empty sella was foundin two patients, and one patient had signal abberation in the sagittalsinus suggestive of slow flow. There were no white matter signal aberrations,even in the periependymal spaces. No other intracranial abnormalitieswere found on any IIH patient or control subject. Intracranial subarachnoidand ventricular volumetric pixel analysis revealed no statistically significantdifference between IIH patients and controls. The authors' results suggestthat brain edema and changes in ventricular or subarachnoid space volumesare either absent or mild in IIH. The main role of MR imaging in thisdisorder, like that of CT, is the exclusion of other lesions that canmimic IIH.</TEXT></DOC>
