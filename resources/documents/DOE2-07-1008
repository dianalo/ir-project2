Nine patients withcalf DVT had low-probability V/Q scans. In 49 patients with thigh clot,12 scans were normal and 17 were of low, three moderate, and 17 highprobability. The incidence of repeat DVT was 15.5%. No patient with calfDVT or a normal V/Q scan when first seen had sequelae suggestive of PE.Fifty-five percent of patients with moderate or high probability scanshad symptoms that modified a workup of PE, and 50% had a subsequent coursethat supported the diagnosis of PE. Most patients who become symptomaticfor PE during treatment for DVT have emboli before therapy is initiated.Patients with thigh clot and high-probability V/Q scans are at risk forearly and late symptoms. V/Q scans are useful in patients with above-kneeDVT.</TEXT></DOC>
