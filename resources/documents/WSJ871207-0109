Then, like clockwork, it stages a spectacular winter rally.    Most institutional investors know how to take advantage of this annual wintertime bounce.    Last year the trough came on the last day of December, and as usual, the institutions did their biggest OTC buying then. During December, they bought an average of 3.4 million more OTC shares a day than they sold, more than double their usual pace.    Their reward? A month later OTC prices were up 10.5%.    Individual investors with a mind to trying this tactic, however, should be forewarned. Catching the rally isn't easy and involves some risk.    &quot;It's a tricky thing,&quot; says Robert Robbins, market strategist for Robinson-Humphrey Co., &quot;because you have to guess right twice and do it quickly.&quot; When the rally comes, he says, the market moves rapidly over a very short period of time. An investor trying to buy in at the bottom and get out at the top &quot;must be a cat with a very quick paw,&quot; he says.    Prices in the OTC market Friday diverged sharply from the rest of the stock market, which edged down. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2% to 292.92, its current low point for November-December. Some 438 of the 4,789 Nasdaq-traded stocks hit new lows for the year. The OTC market may have just veered off toward its annual winter trough.    The actual bottom, says Mr. Robbins, &quot;could come at any time until the last day of the year.&quot; He notes that the OTC market hit bottom on the last day of December in nearly half of the past 16 years.    Even if an investor catches the trough, he must also move quickly to sell the shares -- as OTC prices often cool rapidly after topping in the winter surge.    At the OTC market's high each January, gains in the Nasdaq composite are usually way ahead of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But by year end the story is often quite different.    Analysts attribute this unique annual winter OTC market rally to the fact that individual investors dominate the smaller stocks that trade there. Individuals, in great number, sell shares at tax time to declare the losses or gains. Institutions dominate the blue chips that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and make up the DJIA, and generally don't sell shares for tax reasons.    Because individuals sell for tax, rather than investment, reasons, they are often eager to reinvest quickly. As a result, January is usually the OTC market's moment of glory. In fact, in years when the market rises, January usually accounts for the biggest share of OTC gains -- between 21% and 56%.    This winter, Mr. Robbins predicts, the OTC market should surge nearly 12% from its trough, a bit less than last winter's 13% jump and slightly below the average rally of the past 16 years, Mr. Robbins calculates.    He reasons that last year, tax selling by individuals to take both gains and losses was particularly heavy because of changes in the tax law. That produced an unusually deep trough. This year, he figures, tax selling to take gains will be far less important. On the other hand, he notes, selling to take tax losses this year may be more intense, as so many investors have potential losses because of the crash.    That also may make a difference in the kind of stock that surges hardest in the prospective rally. Investors are most apt to take losses on stocks that have declined sharply in price; thus, the most depressed OTC issues are apt to become even cheaper at the trough.    On rebound, even a small recovery in the price of a very depressed stock could mean big profit. &quot;A stock that is down 75% from its high can double in a rally and still be down 50%,&quot; observes Mr. Robbins, who figures that after the winter rally the worst is yet to come, particularly for the small, depressed issues. He forecasts that prices in the OTC market may continue to slide a further 20% or so before this market genuinely turns up.    One more word of warning. Once -- in the winter that bridged 1981 and 1982 -- there was no winter rally. &quot;Should an investor get stuck in one of these depressed stocks in the middle of a recession, he could be in trouble,&quot; says Mr. Robbins. These small companies, he explains, do worse than large companies in bad economic times because they are financially weaker. </TEXT></DOC>
