(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Guard troops in combat fatiguesbathed and fed patients Monday at state-run General Hospital afterscores of nurses and attendants walked out in a contract dispute.   The state, citing a law against strikes by state employees,sought a court order forcing workers to return to the 480-bed,mostly long-term-care hospital. Superior Court Judge Antonio S.Almeida said he would rule Tuesday.   Thomas Romeo, director of the state Department of Mental Health,Retardation and Hospitals, accused the members of Local 1350,American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, of``walking away from patients'' and said patients' lives werethreatened.   ``Not all the individuals up there right now know exactly whatthey're doing. There's not a lot of tolerance for error,'' Romeosaid.   Seven of the 110 Guard troops on duty Monday had nursingtraining; the rest were given non-medical tasks like feeding,washing and dressing patients.   More than a dozen acute-care patients were transferred to otherhospitals, and the facility stopped admissions.   ``I think this is totally uncalled for,'' Connie Prior, 56, aquadriplegic who has been at the hospital for two years, said of thejob action. ``Number one should be the patients.''   Patient Louise Baran, herself a registered nurse, said she feltcomfortable about the care being given, and while she didn't faulteither side in the dispute was disappointed it had reached the pointof a walkout.   A four-day sickout ended Jan. 31 when the Guard was called in.   Doctors on Monday reported as usual, but about one-fifth of the89 attendants and fewer than half the 13 licensed practical nursesshowed up for the first shift, officials said. About half the 26registered nurses honored the picket line, said Dan Caley, an MHRHspokesman.   Only one of 117 attendants scheduled to work at the stateInstitute of Mental Health, also staffed by union members, reportedfor work Monday morning, said Romeo.   Twenty of twenty-four licensed practical nurses and about 25 of61 attendants reported for the 3 p.m. shift, although some of thosemay have been held over from the morning shift, said James Benedict,hospital director.   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete called out the Guard late Sunday after theunion voted 4-1 to reject a proposed 53-cent-an-hour raise offeredin return for concessions on staffing, including a reduction inovertime and greater management leeway in transferring staffers fromward to ward.   Under that offer, attendants' salaries, for example, would gofrom $16,600 to $17,600.   The union, which has 1,300 members, about half of whom work atGeneral Hospital, is upset with a new hospital policy not to replaceabsent employees to curb overtime.   DiPrete has ordered the MHRH to erase a $3.5 million projecteddeficit by the July 1 end of the fiscal year.   Negotiations broke down Friday, and no new talks were scheduled.   About two dozen people arrived by late morning in response to ahospital appeal for volunteers, said a volunteer who would not giveher name.   National Guard member Sue McCabe, a registered nurse called infrom her shift at Warwick's Kent County Memorial Hospital, said shewas caring for about 10 patients, ``so that's not really a bigdeal.''   One protester, a therapist who would not give her name, said shefelt no qualms about the walkout. ``I think it's for a good cause,''she said. ``We have a medical emergency staff (on call) in caseanything should happen. It's not like we're totally abandoningthem.''</TEXT></DOC>
