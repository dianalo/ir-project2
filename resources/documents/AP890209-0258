(AP) _ RJR Nabisco Inc. employees and localbusiness leaders were still wondering about the company's futureThursday as the record $24.53 billion tender offer for the food andtobacco giant expired.   Frank Doss, a 22-year veteran of the company's R.J. ReynoldsTobacco Co. subsidiary, voiced a concern held by many workers: Howwould Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., RJR Nabisco's new owner, repaythe massive debt it took on to buy the firm?   ``I'm concerned about layoffs and possible cuts in benefits,''Doss said.   Kohlberg Kravis is acquiring RJR Nabisco through a leveragedbuyout, which involves heavy borrowing. LBO debt is repaid throughthe sale of a company's assets or with its cash flow, andcost-cutting and job reductions often result.   RJR Nabisco workers also worried about who would eventually runthe company and whether the tobacco division's headquarters would bemoved from Winston-Salem.   The possible economic and social impact of the buyout could befar-reaching in Forsyth County, where an estimated $1.5 billion inRJR stock is held by individuals and where thousands of jobs arelinked to the fate of R.J. Reynolds.   Kohlberg Kravis' tender offer for RJR Nabisco stock expiredThursday morning, and the investment firm said it had been tenderedapproximately 97.2 percent of the outstanding common shares.   Doss and another RJR Reynolds worker, Larry Jones, who has put in14 years at the tobacco company, said they tendered their RJR stockbefore Thursday's deadline. They also could have sold their sharesof the stock, which closed at more than $100 a share on Wednesday.   ``People were selling their stock and others were buying it,''Jones said. ``So I guess that says something about the faith theyhave in it.''   Kohlberg Kravis also announced Thursday that J. Paul Sticht, aformer RJR Industries Inc. chairman, had been appointed acting chiefexecutive officer, replacing F. Ross Johnson, who resigned.   A group led by Johnson made the first move toward buying RJRNabisco back in October and then fought a losing battle againstKohlberg Kravis.   Ever since the takeover fight began, stories circulated ofproduction-line workers who would become millionaires as stockprices nearly doubled. Those stories were tempered somewhat by therumors of layoffs and cutbacks.   Thursday's developments passed with little notice in the streetsaround the tobacco company's headquarters. RJR Reynolds spokesmanDavid Fischel said it was not considered a landmark day at thedivision.   ``I'd say most of the excitement right now is centered at thebanks and stock brokerage firms,'' he said.   Fred Nordenholz, president of the Winston-Salem Chamber ofCommerce, said he expected there would be more fireworks before thedeal was finalized.   ``When you're involved in battle, the adrenalin begins to pumpwhen the first shots are fired,'' he said. ``We're waiting to seewhat happens.''   It was not immediately known when the acquisition would becompleted.</TEXT></DOC>
