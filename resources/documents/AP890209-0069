Authorities had said he died in a firebombattack, but today they expressed doubts.   Palestinians closed shops and businesses on the second day of ageneral strike marking the beginning of the 15th month of theuprising against Israeli occupation.   The strike came after a day of widespread violence that claimedthe lives of up to six Palestinians, including two in a prison riot.   Arab reports today said Nidal Zuhdi Deeb, 17, became the secondinmate to die as a result of wounds sustained when troops openedfire to quell the riot at Megiddo prison in northern Israel onWednesday. Another prisoner died Wednesday.   Also Wednesday, settler Albert Gerassi, 38, died when his carwent up in flames near the West Bank settlement of Alfei Menashe, 10miles northeast of Tel Aviv. News of his death caused angryreactions Jewish settlers.   Settlers from nearby Ariel flocked to the main road and stonedArab-owned cars, distinguishable by blue license plates. Othershurled rocks at houses and fired guns in the air.   Israel radio said several cars were damaged and a Palestiniancouple was injured when their vehicle was forced off the road into aditch.   ``If there is no change, they (Arabs) must understand that theremay be a Jewish uprising as well,'' said Meir Indor, a spokesman forthe Jewish settler's council. ``We can also throw firebombs intocivilian cars.''   But the army and police said today investigators found no glassfragments or other evidence of a firebomb. ``We were looking forremains (of a firebomb), and we didn't find any, and there aredoubts,'' said an army official.   The daily Davar newspaper said the incident raised suspicionsPalestinians were using a new method of attack. Other newspaperssaid the fire may have been started by a short circuit.   At Alfei Menashe, settlers held a stormy meeting Wednesday nightwith the army's West Bank commander, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna.   ``You simply have to resign,'' shouted one settler amid loudcheers.   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank, along withabout 850,000 Palestinians.   Fifteen Israelis have died in previous violence during thePalestinian uprising which began on Dec. 8, 1987. The Palestiniandeath toll is 379.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir chastized settlers for theiractions.   ``This encourages them (Palestinians) to continue and increasetheir attacks because they see their enemies getting angry andappearing to lose their equilibrium,'' he said on Israel army radio.   In Nablus, hospital officials said 8-year-old Mohammed TalalBisharat died today of head injuries suffered last weekend in anexplosion. Relatives said he and another youth were injured when anexplosive object was hurled at them from a military jeep in FroushBeit Dejan. His 13-year-old cousin, Anwar Bisharat, was injured inthe incident.   The army said the youth apparently played with something thatexploded. A spokeswoman rejected the claim the object was thrownfrom an army jeep.   ``No Israeli soldiers were in the area. It is has nothing to dowith Israeli soldiers,'' she said.   Hospital officials said five Palestinians died Wednesday, threeshot in clashes with the army in the West Bank, one in a prison riotin Israel and another as the result of wounds received earlier thisweek in Gaza. The army confirmed four died.</TEXT></DOC>
