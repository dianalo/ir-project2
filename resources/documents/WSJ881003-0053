The litigation, filed in state court here, marks the first major enforcement action under the state's Proposition 65 measure, which requires &quot;clear and reasonable warning&quot; about products that the state has determined contain carcinogens above a certain level. The defendants' potential liability under the litigation could apparently reach very high levels, but the attorney general's office stressed that the suit seeks to resolve alleged shortcomings in compliance, not win big penalties.    Cigarettes, which contain a health warning on their packaging, weren't included in the litigation brought by Attorney General John Van de Kamp. Neither was chewing tobacco, which under the state's law is exempt because it is a &quot;food product,&quot; according to a state spokesman.    The tobacco products were defined as carcinogenic in a list of products published by the state in February. To satisfy the law's requirements and to avoid plastering their stores with signs for each product named in the list, grocers banded together to form a group called the Ingredient Communication Council. The council operates a toll-free number, posted in stores, which consumers can call to get the product information that the law requires be made available.    The state's suit contends that the 800 number, which receives only about 100 calls a day, is an inadequate remedy.    A spokesman for one of the defendants, the Lucky chain owned by American Stores Co., said the chain had considered itself in compliance with the law by using the 800 number. Tobacco manufacturers couldn't be reached for comment.    As the labeling problem mounts, grocers are seeking to have manufacturers bear the burden. Earlier this month, closely held Safeway Stores Inc. of Oakland, Calif., announced that its 230 California stores will stop selling cigars and other tobacco products that don't carry health warnings. The chain, which is named a defendant in Friday's suit, said it won't accept delivery of unlabeled tobacco products after Oct. 17. </TEXT></DOC>
