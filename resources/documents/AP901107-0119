The weekly news magazine Stern quoted Markus Wolf as saying, ``Ihave no intention of going into exile'' and that he would at somepoint return to Germany ``when things quiet down after the Dec. 2elections.''   Wolf, under investigation in connection with wrongdoings byStasi, did not specifically say he would turn himself in. But theformer spymaster said he expected to be dealt with under existingGerman law.   Stern did not say where it tracked down Wolf, who disappearedafter German unification on Oct. 3.   In the interview that will appear in Stern's Thursday editions,Wolf also was quoted as saying he advised Erich Honecker last yearthat the Communist leader's anti-reform policy had no support.   ``The DDR (East Germany) was on the way to becoming a secondAlbania,'' Stern quoted Wolf as saying.   After his talk with Honecker, Wolf said ``I gave up the lasthopes that he would change,'' the magazine reported.   It is virtually impossible to determine the accuracy of Wolf'sstatement that he was against the policies of Honecker, who wastoppled Oct. 18, 1989 by reformist Communists who permitted freeelections.   Since the collapse of the Communist regime in East Germany manyof the country's former leaders and top officials - includingHonecker - have given interviews trying to put their personal rolesinto the best light possible.   In another report, the newspaper Bild Zeitung said it haslearned from security sources that Wolf is at a Hungarian spa fortreatment of a slipped disc.   Wolf, who served as the head of East German espionage from 1952to 1986, became legendary because of his agents' success ininfiltrating West German intelligence and obtaining important NATOsecrets.   The Stasi, the name for the old East German Ministry for StateSecurity, included domestic and foreign intelligence agents.</TEXT></DOC>
