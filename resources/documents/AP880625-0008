In Washington, a 2-year-old investigation has focused onallegations that private consultants bribed government employees toobtain Pentagon secrets that could help their clients win hugecontracts.   Proportion alone is a significant factor in the relativeopportunity for corruption. Nothing in Europe even approaches thecolossus of the U.S. defense budget, $290 billion for 1988.   Sweden and Norway _ respective recent budgets of about $4billion and $2.8 billion _ have had scandals recently, but theyinvolved bribery and illegal exports. Both Scandinavian areconsidering measures to control their arms traders.   Even Britain, France and West Germany spend only one-tenth theamount of money on defense that goes through the Pentagon funnelevery year.   The giant British Marconi communications group currently is theobject of a year-long fraud investigation, but defense scandals inEurope seldom are publicized. The Marconi case is based onsuspicions that the company made excessive profits and did not payroyalties it owed the government.   Italy had a major bribery scandal a decade ago in which a formerdefense minister and an air force chief were convicted of acceptingpayoffs from Lockheed, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer.   In West Germany, Franz Josef Strauss was accused of takingmillions from from Lockheed when he was defense minister in 1961,but the case was dropped.   ``The Europeans deal with these things differently. They don'twant to know about them,'' said Aaron Karp, an American who tracksworldwide weapons sales for SIPRI, the Stockholm InternationalPeace Research Institute.   ``All over Europe the procurement networks are much smaller thanin the United States.'' he said. ``There are real old-boy networkshere. ... The Europeans are very hesitant to prosecute people onthe team.''   David Greenwood said European governments seldom use middlemenon contracts and most weapons come from ``preferred sources'' thatcoordinate development programs with defense ministries.   Greenwood, a professor at Aberdeen University in Scotland, saidin an interview that European governments and companies have``almost a symbiotic relationship'' and few secrets from each other.   Lack of competition sometimes bloats prices. London's Guardiannewspaper said recently Parliament's Public Accounts Committee hascomplained to the Defense Ministry for years about ``unsatisfactoryadministration'' and a ``disturbing failure'' to control costs.   Karp said corruption is hard to pin down in Europeanprocurements, but some armaments in Europe are three or four timesthe price of comparable U.S. weapons systems.   ``Europeans expect to pay more and they accept that. It's theprice they pay to keep their independence from the United States,''he said.   According to Greenwood, ``The key difference with the Americansis that in Europe until recently you didn't have consultants, the`Beltway Bandits,' or people who are hungry for contracts.''   France's Defense Ministry controls 15 percent of the nationalarms production and the government has a share in companies thathandle about half the rest, a ministry spokesman said.   Supervision of arms sales in Europe is handled by governmentagencies, sometimes by parliaments. Italy has no oversight process,said a spokesman for the prime minister's office.   When corruption occurs in the European arms trade, it usuallyinvolves export sales, especially to Third World countries.   Bofors AB, the privately owned Swedish munitions company, isaccused of paying $50 million in bribes and commissions to get a$2.4 billion artillery contract from India.   Some of the money allegedly found its way to Prime MinisterRajiv Gandhi's Congress Party, spawning charges in New Delhi ofgovernment corruption.   For deals in many parts of the world, bribery payments areincorporated in to the prices of weapons, two sources saidprivately.   One, a retired Swedish salesman of defense equipment, said ofIndia: ``It was taken for granted that you can't secure an armsdeal without bribes.''   Bofors, the largest arms maker in Sweden, also is accused ofcircumventing rules against selling weapons to nations that are atwar or located in volatile regions. The rules are meant tosafeguard Swedish neutrality.   Four former Bofors executives were indicted this week on chargesof smuggling anti-aircraft missile systems to Dubai and Bahrain inthe Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq are at war. None was accusedof profiting personally.   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson threatened to halt all armsexports unless the companies follow the regulations.   Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk, Norway's largest defense contractor,admitted violating Western export controls by selling equipment tothe Soviet Union that would enable it to built quieter submarines.   The deal, revealed last year, led to a public apology from PrimeMinister Gro Harlem Brundtland to President Reagan.</TEXT></DOC>
