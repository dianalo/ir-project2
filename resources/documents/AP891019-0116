LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northern California's experience should be awarning to Midwesterners to strengthen buildings and plan fortemblors on the New Madrid Fault, which has spawned some of thestrongest U.S. quakes, experts say.   The quake that rattled the San Francisco Bay area on Tuesday``has about a 1-in-3 probability of happening on the New MadridFault in the next 10 years,'' said David Stewart of the Center forEarthquake Studies in Cape Girardeau. ``We can watch what'shappening out there and take a lot of notes.   ``San Francisco is the best prepared city for an earthquake inthe world. What San Francisco has been doing for a long time isgoing to pay off.''   The California quake, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, hasbeen blamed for an estimated 270 deaths and hundreds of injuries aswell as more than $1 billion in damage to property, bridges,highways and rail lines.   The earthquake that devastated Soviet Armenia last December alsohad a 6.9 Richter reading, but killed 25,000 people and did $16billion in damage.   ``Armenia was an example of absolutely no preparation,'' Stewartsaid. ``We're not as bad off as Armenia, but we're certainly notanywhere near as well prepared as San Francisco was.''   Quakes are much less frequent on the New Madrid Fault, whichruns from Marked Tree, Ark., into southern Illinois, but scientistssay there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a 6.3 quake bythe year 2000.   ``The New Madrid Fault is probably the most dangerous fault inthe eastern half of the United States, but there is far more dangerof an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault,'' said Douglass Wiens,assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at WashingtonUniversity. ``But that's not to say that there's not danger. Justless.''   The New Madrid Fault has minor earthquakes registering 3 to 4``almost daily,'' but the last one above 6.0 was in 1985, saidBrian Mitchell, chairman of the department of earth and atmosphericsciences at St. Louis University.   In the summer of 1987, a quake of 4.9 hit along the southernIllinois-Indiana border, causing minor damage. A series of temblorsthat ripped through the New Madrid zone in 1811 and 1812 could befelt in Boston and Washington but occurred in a largely unpopulatedarea and the number of deaths is unknown.   There was no equipment to measure earthquakes in the 1800s, butscientists say the New Madrid quakes would probably have been up to8.7. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 is estimated at 8.3. The1985 Mexico City quake that killed 10,000 measured 8.1 on theRichter scale.   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded onseismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increasein magnitude.</TEXT></DOC>
