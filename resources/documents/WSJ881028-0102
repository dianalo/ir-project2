Dan Quayle is heading out to win middle America and we're flying with the senator on the Hoosier Pride, a customized 727: Journalists with enough equipment to cover World War III (and the Dukakis Death March), spin doctors and handlers in dark suits and power ties, Secret Service heavies with curly wires in their ears.    And here's the heroic Indiana guardsman himself, eagerly starting the day, peeling off his dark blue suit jacket and bounding from the front cabin for his daily encounter sessions with the press in the back of the plane.    About five minutes later, he leaves and reporters spend the next 10 minutes decoding what he said. &quot;If Dukakis doesn't want to run for senator. . . .&quot; What? What? Anything is possible here, but senator? Combined efforts of three major network journalists straighten out the weird quote for posterity. The center, he said.    And that's close to where we are now. Dropping from the sky like a truck with the motor running, the Hoosier Pride has thomped down in St. Louis and the 41-year-old Republican vice-presidential candidate is rolling away in a motorcade, past Taco Bell, Hardees, Schnuck's and assorted body-repair shops, to arrive at Fox Senior High School in the little town of Arnold. Teen-agers released from class bellow happily as Dan appears. To the familiar national anthem, two girl xylophonists add a special artistic touch. After the Pledge of Allegiance and some impromptu remarks on drugs, there's Dan's set piece on the death penalty and defense.    Why speak to kids who mostly can't vote? Because a friendly, unquestioning audience plays well on local TV. Or that's the idea. But you know how kids are. You can't ever trust the devious little rat-faces, not for a minute, as Dan Donahue finds out, picking up a mike and wandering through the audience, taking questions.    A boy asks him, if he could do it again, would he fight in Vietnam? (No, the Guard's for him.) A young girl wants to know if a young girl got pregnant should she have the baby? (Yes.) A boy asks if the senator's wife got raped and pregnant would he expect her to have the kid? (Yes, he hoped she would.) And from another heartless youngster, an Irangate question, to which Dan replies such a thing couldn't happen again &quot;in a Bush administration.&quot; What? What? I thought it happened during a Bush administration, but never mind, we're ready to roll.    Union, Mo.: Another bus ride through picturesque farm land somewhat blighted by the Hitler-bunker presence of East Central College. Here young people probe the mysteries of air conditioning, wiring, word processing. There is no speech. The senator does a bit of welding, a talent he picked up during the war. Then he plays some photogenic baseball as speakers atop the press bus blare out a song recorded when the candidate was just heading into the halls of higher learning: &quot;Don't know much about history, don't know much biology.&quot; It's the campaign's unofficial theme song. Apparently the senator wasn't always this self-deprecating. But he's willing to learn.    Washington, Mo.: Another high school filled with teen-agers yelling as he steps out on a stage draped with so many flags I thought he might wear one. While he clears his throat to launch into his drugs, death and defense speech, reporters, a beat ahead, whisper his familiar opening line: &quot;With all this excitement, I can feel what it'll be like on election night.&quot; With his flat, uninflected voice, jerky gestures and nonsense texts, the candidate is a compelling orator only by comparison with Mike &quot;Give me a minute and I'll bore you to death&quot; Dukakis.    Louisville, Ky: Off the Hoosier Pride, onto another bus, and then a fund-raiser on a flag-clad steamboat, where the shoreside sea of welcoming signs includes, &quot;Honk if you're smarter than Dan Quayle.&quot; What's this put-down about. What do these hecklers want. Since when have brains done any presidential or potentially presidential person (or us) any good in Washington. Did a brain do Kennedy any good, he of the Berlin Wall and Bay of Pigs. Did brains keep Nixon in the oval office. Did no blips on the screen these last eight years bring down the world or make this a better place. Or what. When will someone just say &quot;No brains is better!&quot; A local politician introducing beautiful, blue-eyed Dan nearly does so. &quot;He's no Jack Kennedy and I'm glad for it.&quot;    Lexington, Ky.: At the downtown Rupp Arena, which looks built out of corrugated cardboard, an enthusiastic crowd of 1,000 welcomes Dan with a Halloween skit. &quot;Ghosts from the past&quot; sail down in front of the stage with signs saying, &quot;13 percent inflation,&quot; &quot;21 percent interest rates&quot; or &quot;The Ayatollah.&quot; What? What? Isn't this the administration that sold arms to the ayatollah? Oh, never mind, this is too much fun. The side stage now introduces toddler Mikey, driving a little tank. Just like the midget.    &quot;We want substance,&quot; chant some no-fun hecklers. &quot;Bush/Noriega!&quot; But there's no stopping Dan, who punches right back at them (&quot;If I had to support Mike Dukakis, I'd shout, too&quot;) and continues with his speech: &quot;Ye whores of Pocock, mothers of abomination, housewives wallowing in your adulteries. The Lord will smite you. Lolling in your tubs scented with bath oils, in houses equipped with burglar and fire alarms. . . .&quot; No, wait, let me check this tape. That's not what he said. He said &quot;The blue grass state will make Dukakis blue on Nov. 8.&quot;    Tuesday   Seven a.m. baggage call leaves journalists waiting around reading those space-stealing stories about how to deal with those Alaska whales (why not nuke them?), until it's time to attend a local politician's birthday fete. He gets a present from Dan; Dan gets a picture of Secretariat, the horse that restored your belief in humanity, as some woman once said. Dan will do this, too.    Atlanta, Ga.: Thomp. Thomp. Now we've unmistakably landed and are rolling again, heading for Stone Mountain, just outside of lovely Atlanta, premier city of parking lots. Time was when they used to dress up in sheets and burn crosses up here on Stone Mountain. Maybe that's why there's only one black person at this Rotary Club luncheon and he's seated next to Dan. As we watch everybody eat -- Dan pouring rather a lot of salt on his chicken salad and from the looks of it, running out of banter -- a local pollster makes conversation with the press. So how's Dan doing down South? &quot;No value to the ticket whatsoever, outside the religious right,&quot; he says. &quot;But the anti-Dukakis feeling overrides it.&quot; Even Yellow Dog Democrats down here (white, older, primarily rural locals who'd vote for a dog if it belonged to the party) have abandoned the midget because of gun control and the death penalty, he says. &quot;The Republicans have done a wonderful job taking broad conceptual issues and reducing them to an eighth-grade level.&quot; And reducing some folks to sleep. Look at this. A major journalist has just fallen semi-conscious taking notes on Dan's speech. How could he? He's missing the conclusion. &quot;With George Bush you get experience, with me you get the future.&quot;    Augusta, Ga.: Thomp. Two motorcycles, nine cars and vans, and two buses are rolling resolutely to the next stop, the Regency Shopping Mall next door to a muffler shop -- and, please, we already thought of the &quot;Midasize him!&quot; line. On the platform set up next to a hosiery store with a deal on leopard-spotted undies, cheerleaders are trying to spell &quot;QUAYLE.&quot; Then after a mummy called Strom Thurmond mumbles something about the right to carry a gun, Dan talks into a field of cheerful signs, including &quot;Golfers for Quayle&quot; (which joins such previous winners as &quot;Dan Quayle is an Awesome Dude&quot; or &quot;Dan, Call Me!&quot; held aloft with her phone number by a little tootsie).    Dan gets good response, describing his favorite Halloween card (an all black one that says, on the inside, &quot;Goodnight Mike!&quot;). And then this big jerk tries to ruin the event by holding up his purple heart and yelling &quot;chickenhawk.&quot; Local security hauls him off. Does this mean we can have guns but no free speech?    By 6:30 everybody is back in the plane, making phone calls, running tapes, eating, drinking and watching senior scribbler Murray Kempton read &quot;The Idiot&quot; (the novel, not an instant biography). He was pretending he didn't have a non-story to file. &quot;This is my last campaign. And the Duke's,&quot; he says, with no regret.    It was time for another encounter. Smiling as he came, Dan Quayle pushed up the aisle coming to a full stop, oh no, next to a reporter who wanted an update on Marilyn Quayle. How did she feel about his wanting her to bear the child of rape? Had she heard of his response yesterday? &quot;She told me to quit answering hypothetical questions,&quot; he answers. And then he answers some more, spinning uncontrollably into a line of questioning that finally has him saying: &quot;I can't tell my wife what to do!&quot; So doesn't that make you pro-choice? And on and on. Whupped. Oh, it is an awful scene, and almost touching, too. But maybe not worth seeing again, not at about $1,000 a day, excluding hotel. (The cost of one hour of flight time -- $9,000 -- divided among all the people on the plane.)    Tampa, Florida: 8 p.m. The worst thomp ever. &quot;Senator, can you tell us something new?&quot; shouts a local journalist as everybody gets off the Hoosier Pride.    ---   Ms. Hoelterhoff is through with this campaign.
