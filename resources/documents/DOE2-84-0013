Stereotactic heavy-charged-particle Bragg peak radiosurgery,using narrow beams of heavy ions, demonstrates superior biological andphysical characteristics in brain over x- and {gamma}-rays, because ofimproved dose distribution in the Bragg Peak, and sharp lateral and distalborders and less scattering of the beam. Examination of CNS tissue responseand alteration of cerebral blood-flow dynamics related to heavy-ion Braggpeak radiosurgery is carried out using three-dimensional treatment planningand quantitative imaging utilizing cerebral angiography, computerizedtomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cine- CT, xenon x-rayCT, and positron emission tomography (PET). Also under examination arethe physical properties of narrow heavy-ion beams for improving methodsof dose delivery and dose distribution and for establishing clinicalRBE/LET and dose-response relationships for human CNS tissues. Basedon the evaluation and treatment with stereotactically directed narrowbeams of heavy charged particles of over 300 patients, with cerebralangiography, CT scanning, and MRI and PET scanning of selected patients,plus extensive clinical and neuroradiological followup, it appears thatstereotactic charged-particle Bragg peak radiosurgery obliterates intracranialarteriovenous malformations or protects against rebleeding with reducedmorbidity and no mortality. 9 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
