North, former White House national security adviser John M.Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim, along with the ACLU, saidthe use of testimony the three men gave Congress last year wouldviolate their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.   At the minimum, they said, the appellate court should order U.S.District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to hold a pre-trial hearing togive them an opportunity to show that the evidence to be usedagainst them is tainted.   Last month, Gesell rejected the defendants' complaints that theconspiracy case is based on tainted evidence.   He said he had conducted an extensive preliminary inquiry,including an inspection of grand jury testimony and exhibits in hischambers, and found ``nothing'' suggesting that any of thedefendants have had their Fifth Amendment rights impaired ``in amanner that significantly affects their right to a fair trial.   ``Given these factual circumstances,'' Gesell held in a 34-pageruling, ``it is not difficult to reach a preliminary decision thatthe case should proceed to trial.''   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, and his former boss,Poindexter, and Hakim testified extensively last year before thejoint congressional Iran-Contra committees under grants ofimmunity. A fourth defendant, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. RichardV. Secord, also testified but without immunity.   Attorneys for North filed a motion with Gesell to delay thestart of the trial, now scheduled for Sept. 20, until March 1989.   ``To force a trial at that time (Sept. 20) would cause aproceeding without even the semblance of fairness and run afoul ofthe most basic principles of due process required by theConstitution,'' said North attorney Barry S. Simon.   North is charged with conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iranarms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Poindexter, Hakim andSecord are accused of carrying out a secret operation to put fundsfrom Iran arms sales and other sources into unauthorized hands forpersonal profit ``by deceiving Congress, obstructinginvestigations, altering documents, abusing the tax laws, and byother means prohibited by law.''   In their motion, the three defendants said there were criticalissues ``arising out of the decision of the United Statesgovernment to compel testimony and other information from(them)...to broadcast that immunized testimony live to tens ofmillions of people around the world, and then to indict and seek totry these men for the matters as to which they testified.   ``Never before has the government disseminated immunizedtestimony of putative defendants so widely, and never before hasimmunized testimony caught so much rapt attention,'' they argued.   ``Given the infusion of immunized testimony in our community bychoice of the government, (defendants) submit that the broad useand derivative use of immunized testimony by the grand jury, theprosecutors, and the witnesses has been inevitable, and that nosatisfactory showing - is possible as a matter of law.   ``At a bare minimum, (defendants) submit that the indictmentmust be dismissed unless the government can meet its extraordinaryburden of proving no `use,' with the defense having a fairopportunity to test the government's showing in a properadversarial posture,'' the said.   Kate Martin, director of the ACLU Foundation National SecurityProject, who filed the organization's ``friend of the court''brief, told a news conference: ``This prosecution violates thebasic principle that the government cannot force an individual tobe a witness against him or herself.''   She said the ACLU has no reason to question the good faith ofthe independent counsel's office in attempting to avoid the use ofimmunized testimony.   ``However, the issue is not whether the prosecutor acted in goodfaith, but whether the defendant's constitutional rights areviolated,'' said Ms. Martin. ``It is critically important thatthese rights be afforded even to those who may have themselvessubverted the Constitution. To shrink from protecting these basicrights would pose as great a threat to our liberties as any posedby the Iran-Contra affair.''</TEXT></DOC>
