Staley, a 30-year-old man from Tallahassee, Fla., was sentencedto life in prison without parole earlier this summer for dealingcrack. He had no prior criminal record.   ``I've represented people who took lives and received less of asentence,'' defense attorney Robin Rosen complained after thesentencing in federal court.   But Staley was in the wrong place at the wrong time, doing thewrong thing. Laws against drug abuse in the United States havechanged dramatically in the past five years. And while the onlycertain result so far has been overcrowded prisons and overburdenedcourts, police and prosecutors say they now have far more potentweapons with which to fight drugs than they had a short time ago.   ``The laws have gotten tougher,'' acknowledged Hubert Williams,the former police chief of Newark, N.J., who now heads the PoliceFoundation in Washington. ``They are good and strong and effectivefor our purposes.''   A decade ago, drug laws were in remission. The recreational druguse that had become popular during the late 1960s had fostered a newsense of permissiveness.   Marijuana was decriminalized in some states, and laws against itwent unenforced in others. Strong laws against cocaine, heroin andmethamphetamines remained in place, but the legal system was lesseager than it once was to enforce them.   Crack, the cheap, smokable form of cocaine, ended that.   Crack began showing up in a few large cities about five years agoand spread quickly across the country. It led Congress and nearlyevery state legislature to overhaul drug laws and impose muchtougher penalties.   Statistics on convictions and sentencings for drug crimes arescarce, but those that exist suggest that more people are going toprison for drug crimes than ever before.   In New York state, for instance, the number of people servingtime for drug crimes has risen more than 400 percent in the pastseven years.   Federal drug convictions have jumped 161 percent in the 1980s,and the percentage of federal inmates serving time for drug crimeshas more than doubled.   About half the inmates in federal prisons today were convicted ofdrug crimes, and by 1995 the Bureau of Prisons expects seven out ofevery 10 to be a drug criminal. That's in addition to the highpercentage of convicts who were under the influence of drugs whenthey committed non-drug crimes such as murder.   One reason for the upswing is the anti-drug laws that Congresspassed in 1984, 1986 and 1988. They established mandatory jail termsand fixed sentences for drug offenders, taking much of thesentencing discretion out of judges' hands.   Similar laws have been passed by most states, and some have gonemuch further.   ``That's been the major outcry in the last decade _ `Let's gettough on the manufacturers and sellers.' And now it's, `Let's gettough on the users too,''' said Bob Frohling, who follows drugissues for the National Conference of State Legislatures.   In the past few years, Frohling said, virtually every state hasraised the penalties for drug crimes that occur in or aroundschools. More than half have established stronger penalties forcrack than for plain cocaine. Some have extended the death penaltyto include murders committed during drug transactions.   In the most recent wave of legislation, about two-thirds of thestates have enacted laws allowing law enforcement officials to seizethe property of drug dealers.   It's difficult to assess the effectiveness of these laws, andsome people believe they have been been failures.   ``The problem we have is not the strength of the laws, but theapplication of the laws,'' said Williams of the Police Foundation.   Mark Kleiman, a professor of criminal justice at Harvard'sKennedy School of Government, said the emphasis on drug crimes hasdiverted police from other problems while doing little to stop drugabuse.   ``In lots of big cities, burglary is effectively beingdecriminalized while we concentrate on crack dealers,'' he said.   Both Kleiman and Williams also say the cost of imprisoning drugcriminals is getting out of hand. In the federal prison system, itcosts $15,000 a year to house one inmate, plus $5,000 in treatmentcosts for those with drug problems. Some people are beginning tolook for alternatives.   Washington state recently enacted one of the most comprehensivedrug laws in the nation. It includes tough new penalties and anadditional $21 million for prison construction. But it also providesfor education and treatment, and its supporters say that will becrucial to its success.   ``We wanted to attack the problem in just about every responsibleway,'' said House Majority Leader Brian Ebersole.   Williams said preventing drug abuse is the only reasonablesolution, given the alternative of more police, more courts and moreprisons.   ``Who can afford that?'' he said. ``What country can affordthat?''</TEXT></DOC>
