The Pentagon was shaken to its foundation recently by the newsof a two-year investigation into alleged ``insider trading'' withinthe Department of Defense. The news broke when the FBI and theNaval Investigative Service conducted raids on 38 locations insearch for evidence of theft of classified information from thePentagon.   The stories of waste and mismanagement within the DefenseDepartment are old hat; nobody is surprised any longer by tales of$7,000 coffee pots. But even the most hardened cynics have to beshocked at the allegations of the blatant, self-serving activitiesof current and former Defense Department employees. Sen. StromThurmond, R-S.C., a strong supporter of the Pentagon, has predictedthat the nation will be ``shocked'' by the depth of the wrongdoing.   Shocked, indeed. The American people are told that the countrycannot afford programs to aid the young, the old and the poorbecause the nation must maintain a strong defense. While manyAmericans are prepared to sacrifice to ensure a strong defense, itappears the defenders are robbing them blind.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 24   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on fishing vessel safety standards:   Congress appears to be on the verge of at last enacting law torequire basic survival gear on commercial fishing vessels. Bothhouses should be strongly urged to push ahead and rectify one ofthe nation's worst safety shortcomings.   There are some 33,000 commercial fishing boats in the UnitedStates. But for about 90 percent of them _ vessels under 200 tons _the government requires only that there be a life jacket for eachperson aboard. Nothing in the rules about thermal body suits ...nothing about life rafts or even a radio beacon to call foremergency aid.   Though industry leaders, and even many of the fishermen, opposefederal regulation as being too costly and probably ineffectual,there is need for establishment of minimum standards. That wouldsave lives.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 24   The Evening Journal, Martinsburg, W.Va., on federal anti-druglegislation:   Republicans in Congress have introduced extremely toughanti-drug legislation. Vice President George Bush enthusiasticallyhas endorsed the measure, which, among other provisions, calls forthe death penalty to be meted out to drug kingpins.   The likely Democratic presidential nominee, Gov. Michael Dukakisof Massachusetts, has piously proclaimed that one of the reasons heis seeking to take up residence in the White House is because ofthe Republican shortcomings in the war against drugs. However,Dukakis thus far has refused to back the death penalty for drugdealers.   Bush cites the brutal slaying of Drug Enforcement Administrationagent Enrique Camarena Salazar in his argument for establishing thedeath penalty. The vice president makes a good point.   The legislation introduced by congressional Republicans inaddition to establishing the death penalty for drug dealers callsfor increased funding for the Coast Guard to patrol for drugtraffickers. It also would impose stiff sanctions against convicteddrug users, including heavy fines and making them ineligible forstudent loans and federally backed mortgages.   If Dukakis and Co. actually are serious about waging a real waron drugs, their support for establishing the death penalty fordealers immediately would be forthcoming.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 23</TEXT><TEXT>   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on sex bias bans:</TEXT><TEXT>   In supporting a New York City ordinance banning sex bias bylarge clubs, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clearer the right ofwomen to an equal chance to get ahead in the male-dominatedbusiness and professional world.   Previous decisions in this area won women admission to suchbusiness-oriented organizations as the Jaycee and Rotaryorganizations. The latest extended that right to large, so-called``private'' clubs where business contacts and deals are often made.   At issue was a city law that barred discrimination against womenin clubs that have more than 400 members, regularly provide mealservice, allow dues to be paid by members' employers or get some oftheir income by providing services, such as conference rooms, tonon-members. In effect, the city says that such clubs are notreally private.   The court pointed out that its ruling did not apply to allprivate clubs. It said: ``It is conceivable ... that an associationmight be able to show that it is organized for specific expressivepurposes and that it will not be able to advocate its desiredviewpoints nearly as effectively if it cannot confine itsmembership to those who share the same sex, for example, or thesame religion.''   In other words, an organization would have to prove it is trulyprivate if it wants First Amendment protection to keep out certainclasses of people.</TEXT><HEAD>END EDITORIAL RDP</HEAD></DOC>
