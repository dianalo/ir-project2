<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0089 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new software package has been developed called MICROMAP to expand thecapabilities of the Coal Reclamation Information System (CRIS) computersoftware developed in an earlier project funded by the West VirginiaDept. of Energy through the West Virginia Geological Survey. The CRISsoftware allowed the user to extract information from a database containinggeneral mine information, water quality data, overburden analyses, andreclamation-revegetation data for surface mines in 12 northern West Virginiacounties using a variety of geographical related retrieval modes. Thelocations of surface mines that are in file, overburden drill core locations,and water sampling locations are pinpointed on the map. A 7.5 minutequadrangle search mode is available, where the user need only specifya desired quadrangle. The original CRIS data sets have been subsettedinto smaller, county data sets. The original master data set still resideson the mainframe where it can be updated and revised. The mainframe computersystem generates the smaller county-wide data sets and moves these datasets to floppy disks. There are neither statistical nor graphical optionsavailable with MICROMAP as it is primarily a data search and retrievaldisplay manager. The mapping algorithm used is an efficient modificationof the gnomonic method of map projections. MICROMAP has the capabilitiesof displaying all 55 West Virginia counties and corresponding data setswith minimized distortion on a medium resolution IBM color graphics screen.</TEXT></DOC>
