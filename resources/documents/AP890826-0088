The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the defendants'arguments that they participated in Berg's murder because they hatedthe outspoken broadcaster as an individual and not because he was aJew. The two had contended their federal civil rights convictionsand 150-year prison sentences should be overturned for that reason.   ``No reversible error has been demonstrated,'' the appeals courtsaid in its decision Friday.   The court also rejected other arguments by the defendants,including that there was insufficient evidence to convict them andthat their civil rights trial amounted to double jeopardy becausetheir earlier racketeering trial included testimony about the Bergmurder.   Lane and Pierce belonged to a group of white supremacists calledThe Order. They were convicted by a Denver U.S. District Court juryin November 1987 of violating the civil rights of Berg, 50, when hewas gunned down in June 1984.   They were indicted on the civil rights count, of interfering witha federally protected right resulting in death, because there is nofederal murder charge. State prosecutors had decided there wasinsufficient evidence to try the two for murder.   The two, along with several others, were also convicted offederal racketeering charges, which included allegations of the Bergkilling, in Seattle in 1985. Their 150-year sentences for the Denverconvictions are to follow their racketeering sentences.   Pierce was sentenced to 100 years and Lane to 40 years for theracketeering convictions, which were based on their roles in Berg'sdeath, bank robberies and counterfeiting.   Witnesses had testified that the murder was triggered by Berg'son-air derision of the defendants' right-wing beliefs.</TEXT></DOC>
