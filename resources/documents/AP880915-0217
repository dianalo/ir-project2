The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, once deployed, will helpground controllers keep track of shuttles and other unmannedspacecraft orbiting the Earth. Coverage provided by the TDRS ismore continuous than the space agency's current worldwide networkof ground-based communications tracking systems.   A similar satellite was deployed in 1983 and is in orbit, but anearly identical one was destroyed in the Challenger explosion Jan.28, 1986.   Discovery also will be carrying 11 scientific experiments thatlend themselves to being conducted in the weightlessness of space.Two are projects that were designed by students and were packedaway aboard Challenger before its fatal flight. Another is anexperiment to grow crystals of a protein the AIDS virus uses toinfect human cells. Researchers hope the results will help themdevelop better drugs to fight the disease.   But the satellite is the prime cargo. Its deployment isimportant to NASA because it will roughly double the time a shuttlecan be monitored, said Frederick W. Weber, vice president ofContel's technical services division. The Fairfax, Va.-based Contelowns and operates the satellite for NASA.   ``The urgency is to get the second one up there so we can have afull system,'' Weber said. ``To provide full coverage we need twospacecraft in orbit.''   The satellite now in place provides coverage for about 45percent of a shuttle's orbit. It has had some minor breakdowns butis still operating at 98 percent capacity, said Jim Elliott, a NASAspokesman at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.   The TDRS relays signals and data between a spacecraft or anothersatellite and a ground terminal at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.,where it then is routed to the appropriate NASA facility.   Once the second TDRS is up and operating _ scheduled to takeplace about two months after deployment _ the two satellites willbe able to relay data equal to a 20-volume encyclopedia in onesecond, said Jim Elliott, NASA spokesman at Goddard Space FlightCenter in Greenbelt, Md.   The TDRS satellite can provide multiple access and supportcommunications from 26 spacecraft simultaneously.   Before the first satellite was put in orbit, shuttles had tocommunicate with the ground through NASA's network of tracking andcommunications stations around the world. Communications werepossible only when the spacecraft's orbit came into the range of anindividual tracking station.   The TDRS satellite is scheduled to be deployed about six hoursinto the mission, although there are five later times it could bedone if problems arise.   The satellite and an inertial upper stage boooster rocket,stored in Discovery's cargo bay, will be propelled from the orbiterinto space by a spring-loaded ejection device at a speed of 4inches per second.   Later, the satellite is thurst into a higher orbit by thebooster rocket. The booster's first burn is scheduled to take placean hour after the satellite is deployed and the second and finalburn will follow 5{ hours later. The booster and satellite separateabout 13 hours after launch.   The satellite, booster and their carrying cradle weigh about45,000 pounds, making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboarda shuttle, Johnson Space Center officials said. The satelliteitself weighs about 5,000 pounds, is 57-feet wide and has two50-pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas.   The TDRS is to be placed in orbit at 178 degrees West Longitude,22,300 miles over the Pacific Ocean near the Gilbert Islands. Atthat altitude, it will be in what is called geosynchronous orbit,meaning that it moves with the Earth, always staying in the sameposition above the planet.   The first TDRS satellite, which is over the Atlantic Ocean offthe northeast coast of Brazil, will become an in-orbit spare by thetime four satellite have been deployed early next year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance</NOTE></DOC>
