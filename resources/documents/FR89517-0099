The Commission's report also incorporated byreference certain temporary amendments previously adopted by the Commissionpursuant to Section 21 of the Sentencing Act of 1987. These temporary amendments,which took effect June 15, 1988, are set out in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> of April 29, 1988 [53 FR 15532]. Notice of theamendments submitted to the Congress on May 1, 1989, was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4> of March 3, 1989 [54 FR 9121], and a publichearing on the proposed amendments was held in Washington, D.C. on April7, 1989. After review of the hearing testimony and additional public comment,the Commission promulgated the following amendments at meetings on April18, 19, 25, and 28, l989, each amendment having been approved by at leastfour voting Commissioners.

A specificoffense characteristic, for example, might require an increase of fourlevels for serious bodily injury but two levels for bodily injury. Ratherthan requiring a court to force middle instances into either the `serious'or the `simple' category, the guideline commentary suggests that the courtmay interpolate and select a midpoint increase of three levels. The Commissionhas decided to call such an interpolation a `departure' in light of thelegal views that a guideline providing for a range of increases in offenselevels may violate the statute's 25 percent rule (though other have presentedcontrary legal arguments). Since interpolations are technically departures,the courts will have to provide reasons for their selection, and it willbe subject to review for `reasonableness' on appeal. The Commission believes,however, that a simple reference by the court to the `mid-category' natureof the facts will typically provide sufficient reason. It does not foreseeserious practical problems arising out of the application of the appealprovisions to this form of departure.''; in the first sentence of the fifthparagraph by deleting ``second'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``first'';and, in the first sentence of the sixth paragraph by deleting ``third''and inserting in lieu thereof ``second''.<T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> This amendment eliminates references tointerpolation as a special type of departure. The Commission has reviewedthe discussion of interpolation in Chapter One, which has been read asdescribing ``interpolation'' as a departure from an offense level ratherthan from the guideline range established after the determination of anoffense level. The Commission concluded that it is simpler to add intermediateoffense level adjustments to the guidelines in the cases where interpolationis most likely to be considered (i.e., degree of bodily injury). This amendmentis not intended to preclude interpolation in other cases; where appropriate,the court will be able to achieve the same result by use of the regulardeparture provisions.andSection; 1B1.1 (Application Instructions)3.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.1(a) is amended by deleting ``guidelinesection in Chapter Two most applicable to the statute of conviction'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``applicable offense guideline section from ChapterTwo'', and by deleting: ``If more than one guideline is referenced forthe particular statute, select the guideline most appropriate for the conductof which the defendant was convicted.''.<T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purposes of this amendment are to clarifythe guideline and conform the language to andSection; 1B1.2.4. <T3>Amendment: </T3>Section 1B1.1(e) is amended by deleting ``The resultingoffense level is the total offense level.''. Section 1B1.1(g) is amended by deleting ``total'', and by inserting ``determinedabove'' immediately following ``category''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline. 5. <T3>Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned ``ApplicationNotes'' is amended in Note 1(c) by deleting ``firearm or other dangerousweapon'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``dangerous weapon (including afirearm)''. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 1(d) by inserting the following additional sentence:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Where an object that appeared to be a dangerous weapon was brandished,displayed, or possessed, treat the object as a dangerous weapon.''.</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 1(g) by deleting ``firearm or other dangerous weapon'' the firsttime it appears and inserting in lieu thereof ``dangerous weapon (includinga firearm)''.

E.g., in andSection;2A2.2(b)(2), if a firearm is both discharged and brandished, the provisionapplicable to the discharge of the firearm would be used.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purposes of this amendment are to clarifythe definition of a dangerous weapon; and to clarify that when two or moreguideline provisions appear equally applicable, but the guidelines authorizethe application of only one such provision, the provision that resultsin the greater offense level is to be used. 6. <T3>Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned ``ApplicationNotes'' is amended by inserting as an additional Note:<ITAG tagnum="21">``5.

The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.2 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 1 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``As a general rule, the court is to apply the guideline coveringthe offense conduct most applicable to the offense of conviction. Wherea particular statute proscribes a variety of conduct which might constitutethe subject of different guidelines, the court will decide which guidelineapplies based upon the nature of the offense conduct charged.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``As a general rule, the court is to use the guideline section fromChapter Two most applicable to the offense of conviction. The StatutoryIndex (Appendix A) provides a listing to assist in this determination.When a particular statute proscribes only a single type of criminal conduct,the offense of conviction and the conduct proscribed by the statute willcoincide, and there will be only one offense guideline referenced. Whena particular statute proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitutethe subject of different offense guidelines, the court will determine whichguideline section applies based upon the nature of the offense conductcharged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline and Commentary. 9. <T3>Amendment: </T3>Section 1B1.2(a) is amended by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Similarly, stipulations to additional offenses are treated as ifthe defendant had been convicted of separate counts charging those offenses.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and by inserting the following as additional subsections:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c) A conviction by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere containinga stipulation that specifically establishes the commission of additionaloffense(s) shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted of additionalcount(s) charging those offense(s).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more thanone offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted ona separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspiredto commit.''.</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.2 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin the second paragraph of Note 1 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Similarly, if the defendant pleads guilty to one robbery but admitsthe elements of two additional robberies as part of a plea agreement, theguideline applicable to three robberies is to be applied.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and by inserting the following as additional Notes:<ITAG tagnum="21">``4. Subsections (c) and (d) address circumstances in which the provisionsof Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) are to be applied although theremay be only one count of conviction. Subsection (c) provides that in thecase of a stipulation to the commission of additional offense(s), the guidelinesare to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of an additionalcount for each of the offenses stipulated. For example, if the defendantis convicted of one count of robbery but, as part of a plea agreement,admits to having committed two additional robberies, the guidelines areto be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of three counts ofrobbery. Subsection (d) provides that a conviction on a conspiracy countcharging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated as if thedefendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each offensethat he conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a singlecount of conspiracy establishes that the defendant conspired to committhree robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant hadbeen convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery,one count of conspiracy to commit the second robbery, and one count ofconspiracy to commit the third robbery. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) becausethere are cases in which the jury's verdict does not establish which offense(s)was the object of the conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) shouldonly be applied with respect to an object offense alleged in the conspiracycount if the court, were it sitting as a trier of fact, would convict thedefendant of conspiring to commit that object offense. Note, however, ifthe object offenses specified in the conspiracy count would be groupedtogether under andSection; 3D1.2(d) (e.g., a conspiracy to steal three governmentchecks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoing analysis, becauseandSection; 1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant's conduct.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> This amendment creates a new subsection(subsection (d)) to specify that a conviction of conspiracy to commit morethan one offense is treated for guideline purposes as if the defendanthad been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each offense thatthe defendant conspired to commit. The current instruction found only atApplication Note 9 of andSection; 3D1.2 is inadequate. For consistency, materialnow contained at andSection; 1B1.2(a) concerning stipulations to having committedadditional offenses is moved to a new subsection (subsection (c)). Additional Commentary (Application Note 5) is provided to address casesin which the jury's verdict does not specify how many or which offenseswere the object of the conspiracy of which the defendant was convicted.Compare U.S. v. Johnson, 713 F.2d 633, 645-46 (11th Cir. 1983) (convictionstands if there is sufficient proof with respect to any one of the objectives),with U.S. v. Tarnopol, 561 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1977) (failure of proof withrespect to any one of the objectives renders the conspiracy convictioninvalid). In order to maintain consistency with other andSection; 1B1.2(a)determinations, this decision should be governed by a reasonable doubtstandard. A higher standard of proof should govern the creation of whatis, in effect, a new count of conviction for the purposes of Chapter Three,Part D (Multiple Counts). Because the guidelines do not explicitly establishstandards of proof, the proposed new application note calls upon the courtto determine which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy as if itwere ``sitting as a trier of fact.'' The foregoing determination is notrequired, however, in the case of offenses that are grouped together underandSection; 3D1.2(d) (e.g., fraud and theft) because andSection; 1B1.3(a)(2)governs consideration of the defendant's conduct. andSection; 1B1.3 Relevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the GuidelineRange) 10.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.3 is amended in subsection (a)(3) by deleting``or risk of harm'', and by deleting ``if the harm or risk was caused intentionally,recklessly or by criminal negligence, and all harm or risk'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``and all harm''. Section 1B1.3 is amended by deleting subsection (a)(4) in its entirety,by renumbering subsection (a)(5) as (a)(4), and by inserting ``and'' atthe end of subsection (a)(3) immediately following the semicolon. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.3 captioned ``Background'' is amended bydeleting the fifth paragraph in its entirety as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of the defendant's `stateof mind, intent, motive or purpose in committing the offense.' The defendant'sstate of mind is an el ement of the offense that may constitute a specificoffense characteristic. See, e.g., andSection; 2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter)(distinction made between recklessness and criminal negligence). The guidelinesalso incorporate broader notions of intent or purpose that are not elementsof the offense, e.g., whether the offense was committed for profit, orfor the purpose of facilitating a more serious offense. Accordingly, suchfactors must be considered in determining the applicable guideline range.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and by inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of any other informationspecified in the applicable guideline. For example, andSection; 2A1.4 (InvoluntaryManslaughter) specifies consideration of the defendant's state of mind;andSection; 2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives) specifiesconsideration of the risk of harm created.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to deletelanguage pertaining to ``risk of harm'' and ``state of mind'' as unnecessary.Cases in which the guidelines specifically address risk of harm or stateof mind are covered in the amended guideline under subsection (a)(4) (formerlysubsection (a)(5)). In addition, the amendment deletes reference to harmcommitted ``intentionally, recklessly, or by criminal negligence'' as unnecessaryand potentially confusing. 11. <T3>Amendment: </T3>Section 1B1.3 is amended by deleting ``The conductthat is relevant to determining the applicable guideline range includesthat set forth below.''. Section 1B1.3(b) is amended by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(b) Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). Todetermine the criminal history category and the applicability of the careeroffender and criminal livelihood guidelines, the court shall consider allconduct relevant to a determination of the factors enumerated in the respectiveguidelines in Chapter Four.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(b) Chapters Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) andFive (Determining the Sentence). Factors in Chapters Four and Five thatestablish the guideline range shall be determined on the basis of the conductand information specified in the respective guidelines.''.</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.3 captioned ``Background'' is amended inthe second paragraph by deleting ``Chapter Four'' and inserting in lieuthereof ``Chapters Four and Five'', and by deleting ``that Chapter'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``those Chapters''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline. 12. <T3>Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; lBl.3 captioned ``ApplicationNotes'' is amended in Note 1 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``If the conviction is for conspiracy, it includes conduct in furtheranceof the conspiracy that was known to or was reasonably foreseeable by thedefendant. If the conviction is for solicitation, misprision or accessoryafter the fact, it includes all conduct relevant to determining the offenselevel for the underlying offense that was known to or reasonably shouldhave been known by the defendant. See generally andSection;andSection; 2Xl.1-2X4.1.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``In the case of criminal activity undertaken in concert with others,whether or not charged as a conspiracy, the conduct for which the defendantis `otherwise accountable' also includes conduct of others in furtheranceof the execution of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonablyforeseeable by the defendant. Because a count may be broadly worded andinclude the conduct of many participants over a substantial period of time,the scope of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity, and hence relevantconduct, is not necessarily the same for every participant. Where it isestablished that the conduct was neither within the scope of the defendant'sagreement, nor was reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminalactivity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, such conduct is notincluded in establishing the defendant's offense level under this guideline.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact,the conduct for which the defendant is `otherwise accountable' includesall conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlyingoffense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant Is Accountable </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convictedof importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loadinga boat containing a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the numberof bales of marihuana that he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding anyclaim on his part that he was neither aware of, nor could reasonably foresee,that the boat contained this quantity of marihuana, Defendant A is heldaccountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana on the boat becausehe aided and abetted the unloading, and hence the importation, of the entireshipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which$15,000 is taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantivecount of bank robbery. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken becausehe aided and abetted the taking of the money. He is accountable for theinjury inflicted because he participated in concerted criminal conductthat he could reasonably foresee might result in the infliction of injury.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsementon an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant Dthen uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain$15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800check. Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulentscheme to obtain $15,000 was beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeablein connection with, the criminal activity he jointly undertook with DefendantD.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a schemeto sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains$20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted ofmail fraud. Each defendant is accountable for the entire amount ($55,000)because each aided and abetted the other in the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively,because Defendants F and G engaged in concerted criminal activity, eachis accountable for the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of eachwas in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and wasreasonably foreseeable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importationconspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a singleshipment. Defendants H, I, and J may be included in a single count chargingconspiracy to import marihuana. For the purposes of determining the offenselevel under this guideline, Defendant J is accountable for the entire singleshipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and any acts or omissionsin furtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable. Heis not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana importedby Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonablyforeseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointlyundertake with Defendants H and I (i.e., the importation of the singleshipment of marihuana).''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe definition of conduct for which the defendant is ``otherwise accountable.''andSection; 1B1.5 Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines13.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.5 is amended by deleting ``adjustmentsfor'', and by inserting ``and cross references'' immediately before theperiod at the end of the sentence. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.5 captioned ``Application Note'' is amendedin Note 1 by inserting ``and cross references'' immediately before ``aswell as the base offense level''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline and Commentary. 14.<T3> Amendment:</T3> The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.5 captioned ``ApplicationNote'' is amended in Note 1 by deleting: ``If the victim was vulnerable,the adjustment from andSection; 3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) also would apply.''.<T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to deletean unnecessary sentence. No substantive change is made. andSection; 1B1.9 Petty Offenses 15.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.9 is amended in the title by deleting``Petty Offenses'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Class B or C Misdemeanorsand Infractions''. Section 1B1.9 is amended by deleting ``(petty offense)''. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.9 captioned ``Application Notes is amendedin the first sentence of Note l by deleting ``petty offense'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction'', in the secondsentence of Note 1 by deleting ``A petty offense is any offense for whichthe maximum sentence that may be imposed does not exceed six months' imprisonment.''and inserting in lieu thereof ``A Class B misdemeanor is any offense forwhich the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is more than thirty daysbut not more than six months; a Class C misdemeanor is any offense forwhich the maximum term of imprisonment is more than five days but not morethan thirty days; an infraction is any offense for which the maximum authorizedterm of imprisonment is not more than five days.'', in the first sentenceof Note 2 by deleting ``petty offenses'' and inserting in lieu thereof``Class B or C misdemeanors or infractions'', in the second sentence ofNote 2 by deleting ``petty'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``such'', inthe third sentence of Note 2 by deleting ``petty offense'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction'' and, in Note3 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``3.

Consequently, to the extent that somepublished guidelines may appear to cover petty offenses, they should bedisregarded even if they appear in the Statutory Index'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"> and inserting in lieu thereof ``exempted all Class B and C misdemeanorsand infractions from the coverage of the guidelines''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> Section 7089 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Actof 1988 revises the definition of a petty offense so that it no longerexactly corresponds with a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction. Underthe revised definition, a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction that hasan authorized fine of more than $5,000 for an individual (or more than$10,000 for an organization) will not be a petty offense. This legislativerevision does not affect the maximum terms of imprisonment authorized.The maximum authorized term of imprisonment remains controlled by the gradeof the offense (i.e., the maximum term of imprisonment remains five daysfor an infraction, thirty days for a Class C misdemeanor, and six monthsfor a Class B misdemeanor). Because the statutory grade of the offense(i.e., a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction) is the more relevantdefinition for guideline purposes, this amendment deletes the referencesin andSection; 1B1.9 to ``petty offenses'' and in lieu thereof inserts referencesto ``Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions.''In addition, this amendment converts the wording of the Commission's emergencyamendment at andSection; 1B1.9 (effective June 15, 1988) into that appropriatefor a permanent amendment. andSection; 2A1.1 First Degree Murder 16. <T3>Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 2A1.1 captioned ``StatutoryProvision'' is amended by deleting ``Provision'' and inserting in lieuthereof ``Provisions'', and by inserting ``; 21 U.S.C. 848(e)'' at theend immediately before the period.

If the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. 848(e), a sentenceof death may be imposed under the specific provisions contained in thatstatute. This guideline applies when a sentence of death is not imposed.''.</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 2A1.1 captioned ``Background'' is amended bydeleting the word ``statute'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``18 U.S.C.1111'' and by adding the following immediately after the first sentence:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Prior to the applicability of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,a defendant convicted under this statute and sentenced to life imprisonmentcould be paroled (see 18 U.S.C. 4205(a)). Because of the abolition of paroleby that Act, the language of 18 U.S.C. 1111(b) (which was not amended bythe Act) appears on its face to provide a mandatory minimum sentence oflife imprisonment for this offense. Other provisions of the Act, however,classify this offense as a Class A felony (see 18 U.S.C. 3559(a)(1)), forwhich a term of imprisonment of any period of time is authorized as analternative to imprisonment for the duration of the defendant's life (see18 U.S.C. 3559(b), 3581(b)(1), as amended); hence, the relevance of thediscussion in Application Note 1, supra, regarding circumstances in whicha sentence less than life may be appropriate for a conviction under thisstatute.''</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 2A1.1 captioned ``Background'' is amended byinserting at the end thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``The maximum penalty authorized under 21 U.S.C. 848(e) is death orlife imprisonment.

Currently, a defendant convicted under the statutescovered by this section, which are expressly designed to cover traffickingin motor vehicles or parts with altered or obliterated identification numbers,could receive a lower offense level than if convicted of transportationor receipt of stolen property. This amendment eliminates this inconsistencyby adding a 2 level increase if the defendant was in the business of sellingstolen property.

In contrast, the fraudand theft guidelines generally provide a 2-level increase in cases of repeatedinstances under the second prong of the ``more than minimal planning''definition.Unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, it is arguable that the value ofany bribe that was part of the same course of conduct or a common schemeor plan as the offense of conviction, but not included in the count ofconviction, is excluded from consideration. This is because andSection; 1B1.3(a)(2),which authorizes consideration of conduct not expressly included in theoffense of conviction but part of the same course of conduct or commonscheme or plan, applies only to offenses grouped under andSection; 3D1.2(d).Thus, if the defendant pleads to one count of a bribery offense involvingone $10,000 bribe in satisfaction of a 15 count indictment involving anadditional $80,000 in separate bribes that were part of the same courseof conduct, the current bribery guideline, unlike the theft and fraud guidelines,would not take into account the additional $80,000, and there would beno increase for repeated instances.The current guideline may also create various anomalies because the multiplecount rule (which applies only where the offenses are not grouped underandSection; 3D1.2(b)) increases the offense level differently than the monetarytable. For example, an elected public official who takes three unrelated$200 bribes has an offense level of 21; the same defendant who took twounrelated $500,000 bribes would have an offense level of 20. The amendment addresses the above issues. A specific offense characteristicis added to provide a 2-level increase where the offense involved morethan one bribe or gratuity. In addition, such offenses will be groupedunder andSection; 3D1.2(d) which allows for aggregation of the amount ofthe bribes from the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan underandSection; 1B1.3(a)(2) (as in theft and fraud offenses). 56. <T3>Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 2C1.1 captioned ``Background''is amended in the eighth paragraph by deleting ``extortions, conspiracies,and attempts'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``extortion, or attemptedextortion,''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>This amendment corrects a technical error.This section expressly covers extortion and attempted extortion; conspiracyis covered through the operation of andSection; 2X1.1. andSection; 2D1.1 Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking(Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses) 57. <T3>Amendment: </T3>Section 2D1.1(a) is amended by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(a) Base Offense Level: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) 43, for an offense that results in death or serious bodily injurywith a prior conviction for a similar drug offense; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) 38, for an offense that results in death or serious bodily injuryand involved controlled substances (except Schedule III, IV, and V controlledsubstances and less than: (A) fifty kilograms of marihuana, (B) ten kilogramsof hashish, and (C) one kilogram of hashish oil); or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) For any other offense, the base offense level is the level specifiedin the Drug Quantity Table below.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greatest): </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) 43, if the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. 841 (b)(1)(A),(b)(1)(B), or (b)(1)(C), or 21 U.S.C. 960 (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3), andthe offense of conviction establishes that death or serious bodily injuryresulted from the use of the substance and that the defendant committedthe offense after one or more prior convictions for a similar offense;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) 38, if the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. 841 (b)(1)(A),(b)(1)(B), or (b)(1)(C), or 21 U.S.C. 960 (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3), andthe offense of conviction establishes that death or serious bodily injuryresulted from use of the substance; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) the offense level specified in the Drug Quantity Table set forthin subsection (c) below.''.</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 2D1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 1 by deleting `` `Similar drug offense' as used in andSection; 2D1.1(a)(1)means a prior conviction as described in 21 U.S.C. 841(b) or 962(b).'',and inserting in lieu thereof `` `Mixture or substance' as used in thisguideline has the same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. 841.''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to providethat subsections (a) and (b) apply only in the case of a conviction undercircumstances specified in the statutes cited.

Section 2H1.4 is similar toandSection; 2H1.5 in that it may or may not involve the use of force. UnderandSection; 2H1.4, however, the offense must involve the abuse of actualor purported legal authority. The base offense level of 10 used in 2H1.4(a)(1)has a built-in 4-level enhancement (which corresponds to the base offenselevel of 6 under andSection; 2H1.5(a)(1) plus the 4-level increase for apublic official). There is an anomaly, however, when the base offense levelfrom (a)(2) is used. In such cases, andSection; 2H1.4 results in an offenselevel that is 4 levels less than andSection; 2H1.5 when the offense is committedby a public official.

The Commentary to andSection; 2H2.1 captioned ``Background'' is amended bydeleting ``Specific offense characteristics'' and inserting in lieu thereof``Alternative base offense levels''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to correcttwo clerical errors. First, the use of the plural ``persons'' in currentsubsection (a) (1) could be read to mean this subsection does not applyif the force or threat was applied only to one person, a result that wasnot intended. Second, the reference to ``Specific offense characteristics''in the current Background is inaccurate; it should read ``Alternative baseoffense levels''. andSection; 2H3.1 Interception of Communications or Eavesdropping 103.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 2H3.1 is amended by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater): </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) 9; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) If the purpose of the conduct was to facilitate another offense,apply the guideline applicable to an attempt to commit that offense. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Specific Offense Characteristic </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) If the purpose of the conduct was to obtain direct or indirectcommercial advantage or economic gain not covered by andSection; 2H3.1(a)(2)above, increase by 3 levels.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(a) Base Offense Level: 9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Specific Offense Characteristic </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) If the purpose of the conduct was to obtain direct or indirectcommercial advantage or economic gain, increase by 3 levels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Cross Reference </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) If the purpose of the conduct was to facilitate another offense,apply the guideline applicable to an attempt to commit that offense, ifthe resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> This amendment corrects an anomaly in andSection;2H3.1. Currently, specific offense characteristic (b)(1) applies only tobase offense level (a)(1). Consequently, conduct facilitating an offensefor economic gain of level 8 or 9 would result in a greater offense level(11 or 12) than conduct facilitating a more serious (level 10 or 11) offense.andSection; 2J1.1 Contempt 104.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 2J1.1 is amended by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``If the defendant was adjudged guilty of contempt, the court shallimpose a sentence based on stated reasons and the purposes of sentencingset forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2).'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Apply andSection; 2X5.1 (Other Offenses).''.</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 2J1.1 captioned ``Application Note'' is amendedin Note 1 by deleting ``See, however, andSection; 2X5.1 (Other Offenses).''and inserting in lieu thereof ``In certain cases, the offense conduct willbe sufficiently analogous to andSection; 2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice) forthat guideline to apply.''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> This section is designated as a guideline,but it is not a guideline contemplated by the Sentencing Reform Act.

Under 18 U.S.C. 3147, a sentence of imprisonment must be imposedin addition to the sentence for the underlying offense, and the sentenceof imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. 3147 must run consecutively toany other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, the court, in order to complywith the statute, should divide the sentence on the judgment form betweenthe sentence attributable to the underlying offense and the sentence attributableto the enhancement. The court will have to ensure that the `total punishment'(i.e., the sentence for the offense committed while on release plus thesentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. 3147) is in accord with the guidelinerange for the offense committed while on release, as adjusted by the enhancementin this section. For example, if the applicable adjusted guideline rangeis 30-37 months and the court determines `total punishment' of 36 monthsis appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense plus6 months under 18 U.S.C. 3147 would satisfy this requirement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Background: </T3>An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. 3147 may be imposedonly upon application of the government; it cannot be imposed on the court'sown motion.

(Senate Report98-225 at 186). Not all of the phraseology relating to the requirementof a mandatory sentence, however, was actually deleted from the statute.Consequently, it appears that the court is required to impose a consecutivesentence of imprisonment under this provision, but there is no requirementas to any minimum term. This guideline is drafted to enable the court todetermine and implement a combined `total punishment' consistent with theoverall structure of the guidelines, while at the same time complying withthe statutory requirement. Guideline provisions that prohibit the groupingof counts of conviction requiring consecutive sentences (e.g., the introductoryparagraph of andSection; 3D1.2; andSection; 5G1.2(a)) do not apply to thissection because 18 U.S.C. 3147 is an enhancement, not a count of conviction.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to reflectthe fact that 18 U.S.C. 3147 is an enhancement provision, not a distinctoffense. Created in 1984 as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act,the statute contained interim provisions (mandatory consecutive sentencesthat were subject to the parole and good time provisions of prior law)that were to be in effect until the sentencing guidelines took effect.The Senate Report to S. 1762 indicates that the mandatory nature of theinterim provisions was to be eliminated when the sentencing guidelinestook effect (``Section 213(h) (220(g) of the CCCA of 1984) amends the newprovision in title I of this Act relating to consecutive enhanced penaltiesfor committing an offense while on release (new 18 U.S.C. 3147)) by eliminatingthe mandatory nature of the penalties in favor of utilizing sentencingguidelines'' (Senate Report 98-225 at 186). The statute, as amended, however,did not actually eliminate all language referring to mandatory penalties.A mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment is required but, unlike othermandatory provisions, there is no minimum required. The amendment converts this section into an offense level adjustment forthe offense committed while on release, a treatment that is considerablymore consistent with the treatment of other offense/offender characteristics.andSection; 2J1.8 Bribery of a Witness 113. <T3>Amendment: </T3>Section 2J1.8(b)(1) is amended by deleting ``substantiallyinterfered'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``resulted in substantial interference''.Section 2J1.8(c)(1) is amended by deleting ``conduct was'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``offense involved'', and by deleting ``such'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``that''.

The amendment addresses this issue by consolidating the currentthree guidelines into two guidelines: (1) unlawful possession, receipt,or transportation, and (2) unlawful trafficking; and by more carefullydrawing the distinctions between the base offense levels provided. Thethird guideline in this amendment is a new guideline to address transferof a weapon with intent or knowledge that it will be used to commit anotheroffense (formerly covered in a cross reference) and a new offense addedby the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6211) (Interstate travel toacquire a firearm for a criminal purpose).The base offense level for conduct covered by the current andSection; 2K2.1is increased in the amendment from 9 to 12. The statutorily authorizedmaximum sentence for the conduct covered under andSection; 2K2.1 was increasedfrom five to ten years by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6462).Note, however, that the most aggravated conduct under andSection; 2K2.1 (possessionof a weapon during commission of another offense) is handled by the cross-referenceat subsection (c) and is based upon the offense level for an attempt tocommit the underlying offense. See Background Commentary to current andSection;2K2.1. The offense level for unlawful possession of a machine gun, sawedoff shotgun, or destructive device is increased from 12 to 16. In addition,the amendment raises the enhancement for stolen weapons or obliteratedserial numbers from 1 to 2 levels to better reflect the seriousness ofthis conduct. The numbers currently used in the table for the distributionof multiple weapons in andSection; 2K2.2 are amended to increase the offenselevel more rapidly for sale of multiple weapons. andSection; 2K2.4 Use of Firearms or Armor-Piercing Ammunition During orin Relation to Certain Crimes 124.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 2K2.4 is amended by deleting ``penalties arethose'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``term of imprisonment is that''.The Commentary to andSection; 2K2.4 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedby inserting the following additional Note:<ITAG tagnum="21">``3.

The Commentary to andSection; 4B1.3 captioned ``Background'' is amended bydeleting ``proportion'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``portion''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to providea better definition of the intended scope of this enhancement.

The first prong of the proposed definitionin application Note 2 above is derived from former 18 U.S.C. 3575, theprovision from which the statutory instruction underlying this guideline(28 U.S.C.  994 (i)(2)) was itself derived. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter Five, Part A_Sentencing Table </ITAG>204.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Chapter 5, Part A is amended in the Sentencing Tableby deleting ``0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, and 0-5'' wherever it appears, and insertingin each instance ``0-6''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> This amendment provides that the maximumof the guideline range is six months wherever the minimum of the guidelinerange is zero months. The court has discretion to impose a sentence ofup to 6 months or a $5,000 fine for a Class B misdemeanor (Class B or Cmisdemeanors and infractions are not covered by the guidelines; see andSection;1B1.9). It appears anomalous that the Commission guidelines allow lessdiscretion for certain felonies and Class A misdemeanors. In fact, in certaincases, a plea to a reduced charge of a Class B misdemeanor could resultin a higher potential sentence because the sentence for the felony or ClassA misdemeanor might be restricted to less than 6 months by the guidelines.This can happen when the Sentencing Table provides a guideline range of0-1 month, 0-2 months, 0-3, 0-4, or 0-5 months. These very narrow rangesare not required by statute, which allows a 6 month guideline range insuch cases. This anomaly is removed by amending the guideline table to provide thatwhenever the lower limit of the guideline range is 0 months, the upperlimit of the guideline range is six months. There is a similar anomaly in the Fine Table at andSection; 5E4.2, in thatthe maximum of the fine table is, in certain cases, less than the $5,000authorized for petty offenses. Providing a fine range of $100-$5,000 for an offense level of 3 or less,and $250-$5,000 for an offense level of 4 or 5, removes this anomaly. Moreover,because the guidelines now cover only Class A misdemeanors and felonies,the amendment increases the minimum fine guideline to $100. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter Five, Parts B_F </ITAG>205.<T3> Amendment:</T3> Section 5B1.4(b)(20) is amended by inserting ``, butonly as a substitute for imprisonment'' immediately following ``release''.Section 5C2.1(c)(2) is amended by deleting ``or community confinement''and inserting in lieu thereof ``, community confinement, or home detention''.Section 5C2.1(c)(3) is amended by inserting ``or home detention'' immediatelyfollowing ``community confinement''.
