Special attention would be paid to the CIA's&quot;relationship with the oversight committees, improving ourmechanism for decision making, particularly on largeinvestment items in a period of more constrained growth . . .and continuing efforts to improve the linkage betweenassessments and collection.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Those bureaucratic words have taken on new irony givenwhat is now known about what was happening at the time.Instead of improved &quot;oversight,&quot; documents were withheld fromCongress. &quot;Decision making&quot; often fell to international armsdealers. &quot;Investments&quot; in U.S. weapon sales to Iran becamethe means to sustain Nicaraguan guerrillas in a &quot;period ofmore constrained growth.&quot;   In nominating Mr. Gates to head the CIA, President Bush --himself a former head of the agency -- is seeking a man witha reputation as an able briefer and analyst. But in theprocess he has also reopened an old wound in Congress -- thesense of betrayal lawmakers felt when the Iran-Contra affairerupted.   Mr. Gates says he was unaware of much of what washappening, but his explanations contradict the forceful imagehe projected as the incoming deputy. His predecessor, JohnMcMahon, would say later of the deputy's job: &quot;If somethingcame up that I wasn't aware of, it was very easy to go findsomeone who knew what was going on.&quot; In Iran-Contra, Mr.Gates's defense is that he didn't ask.   He long ago acknowledged that he and the agency had a&quot;major preoccupation&quot; with the renewal of U.S. military aidto the Contras in October 1986. But Mr. Gates admits tolittle curiosity about how the forces had survived in theinterim. When told by then-White House aide Oliver North thatthe CIA was &quot;clean&quot; in regard to the arms-supply network, Mr.Gates wrote a memo to himself. Yet despite warnings daysbefore of a potential diversion of funds, he made no recordof Col. North's reference to Swiss bank accounts and theContras. &quot;Since I didn't know what he was talking about,&quot; Mr.Gates told Iran-Contra investigators in a 1987 deposition,&quot;there is no reason to include it.&quot;   &quot;All of us in our life, personal or professional, have amoment where we don't want to know,&quot; says Langhorne Motley, aformer Reagan administration official. &quot;The problem a civilservant faces when he exercises that human instinct is, howdoes that square with his job description? Where can Gatesand the rest of these guys draw the line? Where does thepublic and press draw that line for them?&quot;   The same dilemma faces the CIA itself, which was both avictim and silent partner in the Iran-Contra affair. TheWhite House substituted private agents for professionals tocarry out the operation, but the pros were still in the bestposition to observe what was taking place.   Mr. Casey's death made it easy to put the blame on him inthe Iran-Contra hearings four years ago, allowing the agencyto escape largely unscathed. When the investigatingcommittees finally turned to CIA witnesses, lawmakers weresometimes met with disdain and evasiveness. And theythemselves were divided over how hard to press the agency.When Iran-Contra lawyers sought to depose Mr. Gates in July1987, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Borenvigorously protested. &quot;He's one of the most candid peoplewe've ever dealt with,&quot; said the Oklahoma Democrat.   Mr. Gates's candor will certainly become an issue now. Twoformer CIA officers, Alan Fiers, former chief of the CentralAmerica task force, and Clair George, Mr. Casey's deputydirector for operations, are likely to be called to testify.Mr. Fiers has admitted in federal court to learning of thediversion of funds to the Contras months before it becamepublic, and his statements cast doubt on Mr. George's denialsthat he had no early knowledge of the White House operation.   Once a rising star in the agency, Mr. Fiers was an ardentally of the Nicaraguan resistance and broke into tears at hisretirement party when he spoke of their cause. The office ofindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh sees Mr. Fiers as itsfirst truly cooperative witness, and the former CentralAmerica chief had contact with Mr. Gates, particularly afterCongress voted to resume military aid to the Contras.   Mr. George is a more hardened infighter who spentvirtually his entire career in the CIA's operations division.A decorated station chief abroad, he could play therollicking bon vivant at home with a flair for the dramaticand an ability to chat up -- and frustrate -- interrogators.His deposition before Iran-Contra attorneys in 1987 wasscarcely under way before he was greeting lawyers and Housestaff by their first names. Of Mr. Fiers, he said then: &quot;Ilove him.&quot;   Relations were more strained with Mr. Gates, but Mr.George is an intriguing figure because of his position as adirect subordinate to the deputy and also a CIA contact withCol. North. In his deposition, Mr. George referred to Mr.Gates as &quot;my boss,&quot; but his answers also suggested that hemight have circumvented the deputy director's office incirculating intelligence related to Col. North's operation.Col. North, in turn, seems to have seen Mr. George as anally, and a fellow CIA operations officer testified that Col.North was &quot;very ill at ease&quot; when unable to reach Mr. Georgeat a critical juncture.   Mr. George's working relationship with Col. Northcoincided with a deep distrust of some of the privateoperatives used by the National Security Council. In talkingwith Iran-Contra investigators, Mr. George mocked retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard Secord; and early in the Iraninitiative, he had allied himself with Mr. McMahon and Mr.Gates to raise concern over Gen. Secord's past ties torenegade CIA agent Edwin Wilson. Messrs. Gates and Georgewere also aware of Gen. Secord's role with the Contras, andone question is how much information the wily Mr. Georgeshared with his superior in a behind-the-scenes bureaucraticfight to block the CIA from buying a ship and other equipmentcontrolled by Gen. Secord and his partner, former CIA officerThomas Clines.   Mr. Gates's friends and supporters warn that he at leastmust show he has learned from the experience. Says Sen.William Cohen of Maine, formerly the top Republican on theIntelligence Committee: &quot;He is going to have to establishthat he is going to do things differently than he did.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
