When the legislators met a second time to discuss the Feb. 14settlement with the Danbury, Conn.-based corporation, severallawmakers denounced the amount paid by Union Carbide as too low.   At the Supreme Court, a petition filed today sought $600 millionin damages from Union Carbide for the world's deadliest industrialaccident.   The Association for Socio-Legal Literacy, a social service group,sought the higher award because the high court's Feb. 14 settlementrendered the gas victims without further legal remedy.   The government settled after suing for $3 billion.   Opposition legislators yelling ``surrender to multinationals!''left Parliament after House Speaker Balram Jakhar refused to admit acensure motion against the government's acceptance of the SupremeCourt's Feb. 14 order that instructed Union Carbide to pay the $470million as full and final settlement.   Madhu Dandavate, the leader of the opposition in Parliament and amember of the Janata Party, said: ``What we are talking about isvery basic. The fundamental right to human life has been violated bythe Supreme Court order.''   About 300 legislators were in Parliament when the oppositionwalked out. The Congress Party holds 412 of the 544 seats.   In the special session on the Bhopal session later today,Communist Party legislator Saifuddin Chowdhury chastised thesettlement. ``Is human life so cheap in this country we must acceptsuch a low amount?'' he said.   Legislators from the governing Congress Party defended thesettlement, but even some of them said it was too low.   K.N. Pradhan, a legislator from Bhopal, said: ``I agree thecompensation is very low, but at least it is money in hand. Whatgood would $3 billion have done after 20 years when the cases werefinally settled and all the victims were dead.'' The debate wasinconclusive.   About 2,500 surviving victims of the Dec. 3, 1984 disaster, whenmethyl isocyanate leaked from the pesticide plant of a Carbidesubsidiary, came to the Indian capital Tuesday to protest thesettlement, saying the sum was too low and demanding that UnionCarbide officials be hanged.   The pesticide plant in Bhopal, the state capital, was operated byUnion Carbide of India Ltd., a subsidiary of the U.S. multinational.</TEXT></DOC>
