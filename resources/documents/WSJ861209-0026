In financial statements filed with the Transportation Department, Southern Air Transport shows retained earnings of almost $11.9 million as of Sept. 30, or more than triple the level of 30 months before. From a negative position in March 1984, net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- has increased over the same period to almost $7.2 million, according to the statements, reflecting an expanded fleet but also increased revenue from the Military Airlift Command, which handles most cargo shipments for the Pentagon.    The company says the major reason for the financial turnaround is new management installed in 1983. But the increased profitability and contracts with the Defense Department also correspond with Southern Air's role in clandestine operations in recent years. The company was contracted to carry U.S. arms to Israel for sale to Iran, according to intelligence sources, and it was an important part of a private network that helped to sustain Nicaraguan guerrillas after Congress cut off U.S. military aid in 1984.    The bulk of the MAC contracts are for ferrying cargo between domestic military bases; apart from furnishing business and income, they haven't any immediate relation to Southern Air's covert role. Monthly fuel-consumption reports filed by the airline indicate that a portion of its increasing foreign activity in 1985 and 1986 stemmed from international &quot;MAC operations,&quot; but there isn't any direct evidence of a link between these flights and the airline's role in the Iran arms sales or Contra supply line.    A spokesman for the carrier, William Kress, declined to comment on either of the clandestine operations but sought to play down any connection between them and the company's increased success. &quot;It's not a correct assumption,&quot; he said. &quot;I would just watch adding two and two and getting 10.&quot;    Mr. Kress said new management under William Langton, Southern Air's new president in 1983, laid the groundwork for the airline's recovery. In addition, he said, the carrier has been helped by the failure of other cargo lines in the newly deregulated industry.    The chief beneficiary of the improvement appears to be James Bastian, a former Washington attorney who was associated with Southern Air when it was controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1970s. Now living in Coral Gables, Fla., Mr. Bastian was listed as the sole stockholder in reports filed with the Transportation Department in late 1984. Mr. Kress identified him as Southern Air's owner.    The financial information provided in Southern Air's filings shows the company had retained earnings of about $3.4 million on March 31, 1984, and net income of about $849,000 for the prior 12 months. A year later, retained earnings had jumped to $5.9 million as net more than doubled. By March 31, 1986, the company showed retained earnings of $9.6 million with annual net growing to almost $4 million.    In the government's fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1984, the company received $10.7 million in contracts from the airlift command. In fiscal 1985, the value of new contracts increased to $24.1 million. After dropping back to near $13 million in fiscal 1986, Southern Air contracts with MAC are estimated at about $43.7 million for fiscal 1987.    Part of this increase was because Southern Air took over domestic routes previously operated by another carrier, but it also has come as the Miami carrier expanded its operations overseas.    A Southern Air flight with unidentified cargo from an Air Force base in Texas to Tel Aviv corresponded with the sale this year of U.S. arms to Iran through Israel. In the first six months of 1986, federal records show frequent flights into El Salvador's Ilopango military airport, which served as a base for the covert supply operation to Nicaraguan guerrillas.    Southern Air's Miami headquarters is near offices housing the United Nicaraguan Opposition, and while the company denies it is linked any longer to the CIA, there is substantial evidence of its role in the supply line to the Contra forces.    Apart from the record of flights into Ilopango, Southern Air has acknowledged that it had performed maintenance on a cargo plane downed by Nicaraguan forces in October while carrying supplies to the Contras.    The co-pilot was a former employee of the Miami company, and Associated Press has reported that Southern Air helped to recruit personnel for the supply route and paid for repairs and the installation of electronic gear aboard the planes.    This private network was established with help from within the Reagan administration after CIA arms shipments to the Contras were cut off in 1984 by Congress. For Southern Air, the same approximately 30-month period has corresponded with new prosperity. </TEXT></DOC>
