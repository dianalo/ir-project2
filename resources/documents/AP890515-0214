Gorbachev on Tuesday to take their case for a democratic Chinato Chinese leaders.   More than 3,000 students, many weak from a three-day hungerstrike, and an estimated 150,000 supporters and onlookers continuedtheir occupation of Tiananmen Square, the symbolic political centerof China.   ``As a great political reformer, we urge Mikhail Gorbachev totalk to the government on our behalf for humanitarian reasons,''Wang Dan, a student leader from Beijing University, told a newsconference.   Gorbachev arrived Monday for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in30 years. He met China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, Tuesday inthe Great Hall of the People, the national seat of government nextto Tiananmen square.   He was to lay a wreath at a monument on the square beforemeeting Deng, but the event was canceled because of the massivestudent presence.   A planned welcoming ceremony Monday at the Great Hall was heldinstead at the airport and Gorbachev's motorcade was rerouted.   Asked if the students were hurting China's world image bydisrupting the summit schedule, Wang replied, ``If we influenceGorbachev's visit to China, this is not our responsibility, it'sthe government's problem. Our conditions are clear but thegovernment has been silent.''   The students have demanded that the government recognize theindependent student unions that have led the monthlong campaign fordemocratic reforms. They are also seeking a dialogue on such issuesas press freedom and official corruption.   The government has held talks with selected students, but hasrefused to recognize the activist organizations.   While Gorbachev was the honored guest at an official banquetinside the Great Hall Monday evening, thousands of protestersrushed to the steps of the hall and chanted ``Dialogue, dialogue!''   In the early morning hours, bands of youths stormed the steps ofthe hall and engaged in shoving matches with troops.   The youths identified themselves as ``workers'' but would notsay from which factory. Student leaders claimed they wereundercover police sent to disrupt the protest.   One woman from Beijing University, Chai Ling, said at the newsconference, ``If we have to die, we will die at the front. I amready to sacrifice my life for democracy.'' She fainted on thesteps of the Great Hall and was carried away.   Student leaders said five representatives went to CommunistParty headquarters at Zhongnanhai, near the square, early Tuesdayto ask to meet Chinese leaders. They said officials and soldiersturned them back at the gate.   Student leaders said 234 hunger strikers had been hospitalizedfrom dehydration, sunstroke or exposure since the fast beganSaturday.   The students said they had collected $13,500 from sympatheticonlookers since the latest protest began to buy medicine, hats anddrinks and set up a printing press on the square.   On Tuesday, student groups continued to file into the square,hundreds in each group, to support the strikers.   Students and workers backing the hunger strikers marchedthroughout the square on Monday, their red, white and blue bannersfor democracy flapping in Beijing's dusty wind. Thousands ofintellectuals joined the protest.   Government officials held talks with officially approved studentrepresentatives Monday but protesters rejected the discussion as asham.   Spread out around the Monument to Revolutionary Heroes, hungerstrikers sat, lay or sprawled in the middle of the square, eyeshollow from lack of sleep and food.   ``We have been here since Saturday and will stay as long as ittakes,'' said one Beijing University graduate student, his headcovered with a wet rag to protect him from the midday heat. ``I amdizzy, tired and hungry but my problems are small compared to mycountry.''   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang appealed to the studentsMonday to protect China's ``image and dignity.'' Early Monday hewas seen on the roof of the Great Hall, scanning the growing crowdwith binoculars.   Throughout Monday, hundreds of police moved into publicbuildings around the square, but police presence on the square wasscant.</TEXT></DOC>
