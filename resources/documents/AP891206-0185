The bulk of the red ink was concentrated in several large banksthat set aside new reserves for expected losses on loans to ThirdWorld nations, as well as in rising real estate loan problems inthe Northeast and Arizona, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman also said the insurance fundprotecting deposits at 12,824 U.S. banks likely will record thesecond loss in its history this year. The fund declined by about $4billion in 1988 and will shrink by an additional $250 million to$500 million this year, he said.   Bank failures, totaling 192 so far this year, likely willapproach but not exceed last year's record of 211, Seidman said.Based on a fall in the number of problem banks from 1,394 at thestart of 1989 to 1,134 at the end of September, he predicted thefailure rate would decline next year.   Seidman said banks should approach commercial and developmentreal estate lending more cautiously. Although bank profits overalllikely will bounce back in the final three months of 1989, thenumber of sour real estate loans will continue to rise, hepredicted.   ``I don't want to Scrooge up Christmas ... but I'm afraid thefourth quarter will show a continuation of the (real estate) trendswe see here,'' Seidman said.   The loss in the July-September period compares with profits of$7 billion in the second quarter and $7.3 billion in the firstquarter. Last year banks earned a record profit of $25.2 billion.   Commercial banks last recorded a loss in the second quarter of1987. Red ink totaled $10.6 billion and was attributed to losses ondeveloping country lending.   Some of the nation's largest banks again took writedowns in thethird quarter on their loans to developing countries. J.P. Morgan andamp;Co. increased its loss reserves by $2 billion, Chase ManhattanCorp. by $1.3 billion and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corp. by $950million.   Analysts attributed the writedowns to banks' recognition thatTreasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's debt strategy will requirethem to accept more losses.   Brady's plan, launched in March, emphasizes debt reduction aswell as new lending to developing countries. However, critics ofthe plan worry that banks will be reluctant to make new loans afterrecognizing big losses.   Commercial real estate lending problems, common in the Southwestsince the mid-1980s, are spreading elsewhere. In August, Moody'sInvestor Service warned that involvement in real estate lendingmakes large banks vulnerable to rising interest rates or arecession.   In a speech Tuesday, Seidman called real estate lending is ``anemerging area of concern'' and said his agency was studying realestate markets nationwide.   ``Over the last 12 months, real estate loan growth has accountedfor nearly two-thirds of all bank asset growth, and now comprisesalmost one-fourth of all commercial bank assets,'' Seidman told ameeting of the National Council of Savings Institutions in New York.   Delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sourloans nationally, he said. In the Northeast, the percentage ofdelinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
