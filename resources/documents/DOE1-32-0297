Also, if in spiteof all safety precautions, the preventative measures all fail, thereare supplementary safety measures to ensure minimal environmental effects.It was concluded that the risk associated with the operation of westernnuclear plants was so low that it was fully justified in view of theirenvironmental and economic advantages. The topics discussed in the symposiumincluded:- the necessity to bolster public confidence in nuclear power,the phasing out of nuclear power in Sweden, the outlook for nuclear powerin the United Kingdom, cost reductions in the nuclear industry, and uraniumproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
