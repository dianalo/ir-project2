Svend Jakobsen, the neutral mediator charged with sounding outeight parties on a national program, said he could not bring enoughparties together to form a stable government and was giving up histask.   The impasse arose from last Tuesday's deadlocked parliamentaryelection fought over Denmark's non-nuclear policy and its loyaltyto NATO.   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's center-right minority coalitionkept its 70 seats in the 179-member legislature. The two-partysocialist opposition lost ground but still held 79 seats and keptSchlueter from forming a new government. Schlueter continues ascaretaker premier.   Jakobsen said he was reporting to Queen Margrethe II on histhree rounds of inconclusive talks. He refused to talk about futurenegotiations saying, ``It's no longer my mandate.''   Schlueter probably will seek approval to try to form a newgovernment.   But Social Democratic leader Svend Auken told nationaltelevision he would propose that Niels Helveg Petersen of theSocial-Liberals, a 10-seat swing party, lead new negotiations.   Earlier, it appeared the Social Democrats, Denmark's largestsingle party, was on the verge of a coalition deal with theSocialist People's Party, its junior partner in the opposition, andthe Social-Liberals. But their talks failed.   The four parties in Schlueter's coalition are the Conservatives,Liberals, Center Democrats and Christian People's Party.   Negotiations so far have ignored the far-right Progress Party,the only group to gain significantly in the election with a jumpfrom nine seats to 16.   The political maneuvers overshadowed a security policy wranglethat prompted Schlueter to call the early election only eightmonths after the last vote.   On April 14, the socialist opposition pushed a resolutionthrough parliament calling on Schlueter's government to notifyvisiting warships of Denmark's peacetime ban on nuclear weapons.   The government voted against the resolution and refused toimplement it.   America and Britain pointed to their policies of neverconfirming or denying the presence of nuclear weapons on theirwarcraft.   North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries were awaiting theoutcome of party negotiations to see how a new government coalitionwill resolve the crisis in the alliance over Denmark's nuclearpolicy.</TEXT></DOC>
