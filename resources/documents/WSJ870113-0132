Before Vatican II, Catholics -- and many others -- found that seminaries, convents and religious houses were the perfect outlet for unwanted fruitcakes. Anybody who spent any time in these institutions will recall the sudden onslaught of these sodden discs shortly after Christmas every year. People had to get rid of them somehow. Well into the new year, they were served in every conceivable form to aspiring priests, nuns and brothers who, under the then strict and unquestionable rule of obedience, had no choice but to eat them. It was a perfect system: undesired and undesirable desserts to undesiring consumers. People, in what was known to seminarians as the &quot;outside world,&quot; never suspected that their gifts were being consumed by gagging but goodwilled aspirants to higher states of grace.    This supply-side fruitcake system collapsed with the reforms of Vatican II, which largely did away with the &quot;blind obedience&quot; under which so many tons of cake were not so much devoured as swallowed as quickly as possible.    One should note that the present leaders of the American Catholic Church were trained in seminaries where their wills were strengthened by the force-feeding of fruitcake. One should not be surprised, for example, that John Cardinal O'Connor has displayed such mettle as archbishop of New York, that he is unafraid of its power structure and confident of his convictions. He is of the generation of priests and religious who developed their character on fruitcake. These are the same people who taught, among thousands of others, Oliver North in school. Fruitcakes, the portless Flying Dutchmen of the postal service, may have influenced our history more than anyone suspects.    Prof. Eugene Kennedy   Loyola University   Chicago   ---   Being a leading company in the fruitcake industry, we would like to take this means of saying that we do not agree with your assumptions.    Our company has been in business since 1910, producing about five million pounds of Claxton Fruit Cake each year for worldwide distribution. You will be interested in knowing that Civitan Clubs all across the U.S. and Canada have, for the past 35 years, sold over 2,500,000 pounds of Claxton Fruit Cake annually, with most of the proceeds benefiting Special Olympics, aid to the mentally retarded and other worthwhile causes. Therefore, in addition to Claxton Fruit Cake being a quality traditional treat, it does a great deal of good in communities, too.    W. Dale Parker   Vice President   Claxton Bakery Inc.
