East European spies remain on the job, even though the securityand espionage agencies they serve now face reorganization under newgovernments, the experts say.   Authorities in East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland andBulgaria say security forces have a place even in open societies.Traditionally these nations have combined internal securityoperations with foreign espionage.   But the exact size and mandate of the surviving services _ aswell as the fate of their foreign espionage networks _ is mostlyobscured by the traditional lack of public accountability.   One new development is that under democratic leaders, somecloak-and-dagger operations of the past, such as the 1978assassination of Bulgarian writer and defector Georgi Markov, arebeing denounced and investigated. But nowhere have espionageagencies been totally disbanded.   It is unclear what is happening to East Germany's formidableforeign espionage department, but West Germans have expressed fearsthat East German spies will use the open borders to slip into theircountry.   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said EastGermany, for one, continues its foreign espionage activities.   ``East Germany would be well advised to pull back its agentseven before a treaty on closer cooperation is signed,'' he said ina recent interview, referring to the comprehensive treaty that issupposed to be signed between the two states.   ``There have been no indications that spying for East Berlin hasstopped. The Stasi department in charge of espionage is functioninglike it was during (deposed leader Erich) Honecker's time,'' theMunich magazine Bunte quoted Schaeuble as saying.   East Germany's opposition has made the abolition of the secretservice, or Stasi, the top issue in current opposition-governmenttalks. Last week, an angry East Berlin mob stormed and looted theheadquarters of the secret police.   In Washington, CIA chief William Webster said in a speech Nov.29, when only Romania was still untouched by reform, that Sovietbloc espionage had increased.   ``Around the world, our stations are reporting more aggressiveaction, a more robust intelligence collection effort, more effortsto recruit our embassy and intelligence personnel than we have seenin a long time,'' Webster said.   ``The stuff is changing so fast that people are working hardjust to keep up with it,'' said one source at Supreme HeadquartersAllied Powers, Europe.   It is unclear whether the increasing independence emerging inEast European politics will spill over into the intelligenceagencies, which long have assisted the Soviet Union in its pursuitof Western secrets and technology.   The former chief of Hungary's State Security Service, Brig.-Gen.Ferenc Pallagi, said in an interview published late last year thattaking orders on intelligence activities from the Kremlin is ``athing of the past.''   Both Pallagi and his deputy, Brig.-Gen. Joszef Horvath, resignedlast week amid allegations the intelligence service spied onopposition groups in advance of Hungary's March parliamentaryelections.   Maj. Jozsef Vegvari, an officer in the security service, saidFriday that as late as August there was a Soviet adviser attachedto the Hungarian Interior Ministry, which runs the SSS.   ``The KGB is active in Hungary for sure,'' he said. Vegvarifaces charges for revealing information to the political oppositionon surveillance by his own service.   Romania's internal secret police, the Securitate, was dismantledafter the December revolution, but the former chief of the Romanianintelligence service, Ion Pacepa, predicted Romania's espionagewill increase.   ``They will steal technology, and now they will steal it muchmore easily, because people in the West will want to help theRomanians and will give them technology, and they will give it toMoscow,'' said Pacepa, who defected to the United States a decadeago.   Under the new non-Communist dominated Czechoslovak government,Interior Minister Richard Sacher announced last week that the STB,the secret service charged with gathering information ondissidents, had been disbanded.   However, in an interview with the Czechoslovak news agency CTK,Sacher said some Interior Ministry departments ``needed for thedefense of the state will also be needed in independentCzechoslovakia.''   He did not specify what their job would be.   In Warsaw, sources within the Solidarity-led government havetold The Associated Press they are trying to strip Poland's Embassyin Moscow of diplomats who worked for the Soviet intelligenceapparatus.   Still relatively intact among the East bloc services isBulgaria's State Security, known by its Bulgarian initials DS.   After the November ouster of hard-line Communist leader TodorZhivkov, the reform-minded leadership promised to publicize moreinformation on intelligence activities, as well as investigate themurder by poison-tipped umbrella of Markov, the Bulgarian dissidentauthor killed in London in 12 years ago.   There has long been speculation that the orders to kill Markovcame from Bucharest. The scandal forced the resignation last weekof Jozsef Horvath, head of the Internal Security Service.   But although Bulgaria's new leadership is trying to cast off itsStalinist image, the Bulgarian domestic surveillance and foreignintelligence gathering operations appear to be continuing.   ``What we know is that almost every Bulgarian who is doing somejob abroad is an agent or informant of DS, including diplomats,journalists, and trade functionaries,'' said one Bulgarian exilewho monitors intelligence affairs and spoke in exchange foranonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
