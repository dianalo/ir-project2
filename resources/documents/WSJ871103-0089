A decision last week by the Reagan administration has Democrats; big-city politicians; and regions with heavy minority populations, such as the South, wondering if they're getting the short end of the statistical stick.    The controversy centers on who gets counted in the decennial census, and who doesn't. Both sides say the issue is the integrity of the census itself. The stakes are important, since census population totals are the basis for apportioning representation in Congress, redistricting state legislatures, and handing out billions of dollars in federal aid.    The administration wants to conduct the coming census the old-fashioned way, by simply counting noses. Every person the Census Bureau finds, either by mail questionnaire or by actually knocking on doors, gets added to the official total. Individuals who aren't found, despite the best efforts of the enumerators, are left out. That's basically the way the government has been running the census since 1790.    THE PROBLEM with this approach, critics say, is that blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities are far more likely to go uncounted than whites. Residents of inner-city slums and homeless people also slip through the census-taking network at a higher rate than more affluent people.    In 1980, the Census Bureau estimates it failed to find 1.4% of the overall U.S. population, or 3.2 million persons. For blacks, the missing share was closer to 6%; for whites, only about 0.5%. This &quot;differential undercount&quot; costs localities with high numbers of uncounted persons their fair share of government dollars and, potentially, representation in Congress, the argument goes.    The proposed solution: &quot;Adjust&quot; the census figures, using sophisticated statistical methods, to include the uncounted people. Census Bureau officials say the idea is theoretically sound. A National Academy of Sciences committee recommends adjustment in 1990. On Friday, the Reagan administration said no.    &quot;Adjustment may create more problems than it solves,&quot; says Robert Ortner, undersecretary for economic affairs in the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau.    AMONG THE DIFFICULTIES, according to Mr. Ortner: Adjustment is controversial -- the bureau has proposed 24 separate formulas for rejiggering the population totals -- and may undermine public confidence in the census; the separate post-census survey of sample households required to adjust the 1990 totals would be run in the summer, when a lot of people are vacationing or changing homes; adjustment costs money that would be better spent finding people the first time around.    Finally, fiddling with the figures &quot;may create the appearance&quot; of trying to manipulate population totals for political gain, Mr. Ortner says. &quot;We don't fudge numbers,&quot; he adds. &quot;The right thing to do is to conduct a darn good census.&quot;    But refusing to correct the census undercount also has political overtones. Stephen Fienberg, a dean at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says that in an adjusted census, &quot;it's very clear that Republicans don't win, given that you're going to give more weight to black voters.&quot; Nixing adjustment in 1990 &quot;is a political decision, and I find it offensive,&quot; he says.    Dean Fienberg chaired the National Academy of Sciences panel that endorsed adjustment. He says the five-percentage-point difference in undercount between blacks and whites &quot;hasn't gone away. It's going to be there in 1990. And the Census Bureau has methods that would reduce that (undercount) substantially with quality techniques they themselves have developed.&quot; Not to adjust &quot;is a cop-out,&quot; he says.    SUPPORTERS OF ADJUSTMENT are now rallying around a bill introduced by Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D., Calif.) that would order the Census Bureau to correct the 1990 undercount. Debate will be vigorous. &quot;The administration is very itchy about the political implications of including blacks in reapportionment numbers,&quot; says TerriAnn Lowenthal, staff director of a House census subcommittee.    The outcome of the adjustment fight will barely dent the makeup of Congress. Correcting the undercount in 1990 &quot;would probably shift one or two congressional seats at most,&quot; says Thomas Hofeller, director of computer services for the Republican National Committee.    Adjustment would likely mean an extra seat in the House of Representatives for California, on top of the four or more seats the state will pick up from normal population gain between 1980 and 1990. Mr. Hofeller thinks California's gain might cost Minnesota a House seat. Others say Massachusetts is the probable loser.    The biggest stakes in the adjustment battle are at the local level. New York City estimates it would have pulled in between $25 million and $50 million more in federal funds if its population total reflected the half-million people the city says weren't counted in 1980. The undercount also cost the city at least three seats in the state Assembly in Albany.    More accurate minority population counts could also help overthrow at-large local voting districts, which often work against minority voters. &quot;As you improve the counting of minorities, their ability to carve out minority districts is enhanced,&quot; says Jeffrey Wice, director of the New York Assembly's Washington office. </TEXT></DOC>
