The estimated weighted-average margins areshown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. We alsopreliminarily determine that critical circumstances do not exist with respectto generic cephalexin capsules from Canada. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since the notice of initiation (53 FR 47563, November 23, 1988), the followingevents have occurred: On December 12, 1988, the ITC determined that thereis a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is threatenedwith material injury by reason of imports from Canada of generic cephalexincapsules (USITC Pub. No. 2143, December 1988). On December 7, 1988, the Department's questionnaire was presented to Novopharm,Ltd. (Novopharm), which accounts for a substantial portion of exports ofthe subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation.We received replies to the questionnaire from Novopharm on December 28,1988, and on January 24, 1989. On February 2, 1989, under the ``waiver of verification'' provision, section733(b)(2) of the Act, the petitioner requested that an official of theDepartment be designated by the Secretary to review the information receivedduring the first 60 days of the investigation to determine if there appearedto be sufficient information available upon which the preliminary determinationcould reasonably be based. Petitioner further requested, if there appearedto be sufficient information available, that the Department disclose theinformation to the petitioner. On February 6, 1989, the designated officialconcluded that there did not appear to be sufficient information availableupon which the preliminary determination could be reasonably based. Therefore,the Department declined to disclose to petitioner all available information,other than that already available to petitioner under the existing administrativeprotective order.On February 10, 1989, the Department sent a deficiency letter and responseswere received by the Department on February 23, and on March 6, I989. OnApril 4, 1989, the Department sent an additional deficiency letter to respondent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation  </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS subheading(s). The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The written description remains dispositive. The products covered by this investigation are generic cephalexin capsulesfrom Canada. Generic cephalexin capsules are cephalexin monohydrate incapsule form. Cephalexin monohydrate is a semi-synthetic cephalosporinantibiotic intended for oral administration. Its chemical formula is C16H17N304S.H20.Generic cephalexin capsules contain not less than 90 percent and not morethan 120 percent of the labelled amount of cephalexin monohydrate. Thecapsule is made of a water soluble gelatin, designed to facilitate swallowingand a phased release of the drug into the user's digestive system. Prior to January l, 1989, such merchandise was classifiable under item411.7600 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA). Thismerchandise is currently classifiable under HTS subheading 3004.20.00.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation is May l, 1988, through October 31, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of generic cephalexin capsules from Canada tothe United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the UnitedStates price to the foreign market value, as specified in the ``UnitedStates Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>We based United States price on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordancewith section 772(c) of the Act, since the first sale to an unrelated customerwas made after importation. To calculate exporter's sales price, we usedthe packed, ex-warehouse or delivered, duty-paid prices to unrelated purchasersin the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreigninland freight, U.S. inland freight, U.S. and foreign brokerage and handlingcharges, insurance, and U.S. duty, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)of the Act. We made further deductions, where appropriate, for discounts,rebates, and price protection. In accordance with section 772(e) (1) and (2), we made additional deductions,where appropriate, for U.S. credit, advertising, royalties, commissionsto unrelated parties and indirect selling expenses, including pre-salewarehousing, inventory carrying cost, and commissions to related parties.The total of the U.S. indirect selling expenses formed the cap for theallowable home market indirect selling expenses offset under andSection;353.15(c) of our regulations. Pursuant to section 772(d)(1)(B) of the Act, we added duty drawback paidby the Canadian government to respondent as a rebate of duties paid onimports of raw cephalexin. For the purposes of this preliminary determination, we used the informationprovided by the respondent concerning date of sale. However, we have askedrespondent for additional information and clarification regarding the dateof sale methodology used in the response. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on the packed, ex-warehouse or delivered home market pricesto unrelated purchasers. We made deductions from the home market price,where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance, discounts, creditexpenses, royalties, and commissions to unrelated parties. We also deductedindirect selling expenses incurred on home market sales up to the amountof indirect selling expenses incurred on  sales in the U.S. market, inaccordance with andSection; 353.15(c) of our regulations. We included advertisingexpenses as an indirect expense because respondent did not provide sufficientinformation to determine if the advertising was directed at the customer'scustomers. We did not deduct home market warranty expenses because it isunclear whether the respondent used a reasonable method for quantifyingthe expense. We will review the calculation of this expense at verification.In order to adjust for differences in packing between the two markets,we deducted Canadian home market packing costs from foreign market valueand added U.S. packing costs. Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act, we made further adjustmentsto the home market price to account for differences in merchandise. Incalculating the difference in merchandise adjustment, respondent includeda difference in the cost for quality control. Respondent claimed that theexpenses for quality control, testing and inspection for cephalexin capsuleproducts sold in the Canadian market differ slightly from those expensesincurred with respect to the U.S. product. Since differences in this expensedo not arise from differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise,the difference in quality control expenses was not included in the differencein merchandise adjustment. Respondent claimed that Canadian provincial taxes are paid at the pointof sale, but not by respondent. We have requested additional informationon the imposition of these taxes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>We used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of sale, inaccordance with section 773(a)(I) of the Act, as amended by section 615of the Trade and Tariff Act of l984. All currency conversions were madeat the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all informationused in reaching the final determination in this investigation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances </ITAG>Petitioner alleged in the petition that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Canada. Section733(e)(I) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) (i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation,or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value,and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>We generally consider the following factors in determining whether importshave been massive over a relatively short period of time: (l) The volumeand value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3)the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we used specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.Based on our analysis of the monthly shipment data submitted by the respondent,we have found that imports of the subject merchandise have been massiveover a relatively short period of time. Therefore, we find that the requirementsof section 733(e)(1)(B) are met. We have examined antidumping measures undertaken by foreign countries asreported through the GATT Committee on Antidumping Practices. We foundno record of antidumping orders on cephalexin from Canada. Therefore, wefind that the requirements of section 733(e)(1)(A)(i) are not met. As forsection 733(e)(1)(A)(ii), it is our standard practice to impute knowledgeof dumping when the estimated margins in our determinations are of sucha magnitude that the importer should realize that dumping exists with regardto the subject merchandise.The estimated margins found in this determination are not sufficientlyhigh to impute knowledge of dumping. Therefore, despite the existence ofmassive imports, we conclude that critical circumstances do not exist withrespect to imports of generic cephalexin capsules from Canada. <ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d)(I) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of generic cephalexincapsules from Canada, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' sectionof this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cashdeposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by which theforeign market value of the subject merchandise from Canada exceeds theUnited States price as shown below. This suspension of liquidation willremain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average margins areas follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10</C> <H1>Manufacturer/Producer/Exporter</H1><H1>Weighted-average margin percentage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Novopharm, Ltd.<D>9.43</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All others<D>9.43</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification </ITAG>In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITCof our determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC allnonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietaryinformation in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under administrative protective order,without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.The ITC will determine whether these imports materially injure, or threatenmaterial injury to, the U.S. industries before the later of 120 days afterthe date of this preliminary determination or 45 days after our final determination,if affirmative. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment </ITAG>In accordance with 19 CFR 353.47, if requested, we will hold a public hearingto afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on this preliminarydetermination at 10:30 a.m. on May 26, 1989, at the U.S. Department ofCommerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington,DC 20230.
