In speeches to the meeting here of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and European Community Commission President Jacques Delors both expressed concern about surging U.S. domestic demand. Neither called for a rise in U.S. interest rates or for any other specific measure to hold down domestic spending growth.    By contrast, Treasury Secretary James Baker delivered a generally upbeat speech to the meeting, saying world trade imbalances are on their way to being resolved and that &quot;we have been given solid grounds for optimism&quot; over the past year. Mr. Baker didn't express concerns about inflation, or domestic demand. However, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and many private U.S. economists have said that a watchful eye must be kept on domestic demand, lest inflation resume. The Fed recently tightened interest rates slightly with that in mind.    Responding to the European criticism, a spokesman for Mr. Baker noted that domestic demand growth in the U.S. in 1988 is projected to slow to 1.5% from 2.5% last year, and that the domestic demand figure would be well below the projected 2.4% growth in the gross national product. Asked here yesterday by a television interviewer whether inflation is a problem in the U.S., Mr. Baker said, &quot;We don't see any evidence of that.&quot; He added that in the first quarter, inflation had risen at a 4.2% annual rate, roughly in line with the Reagan administration forecast of 4.0%.    The differing perspectives on macroeconomic issues were mirrored by a sharp dispute between the U.S. and Europeans at the meeting over the wording of a statement on agricultural trade in the communique expected to be issued by the OECD today. In the agriculture dispute, which was widely predicted before the session began, the U.S. is demanding language calling for specific commitments to phase out agricultural subsidies altogether by a future date, while the Europeans favor vaguer commitments and a goal of merely reducing subsidies over time, rather than scrapping them.    Mr. Lawson told the conference that further adjustment in trade imbalances shouldn't be accomplished by a further reduction in the dollar's value, but instead by &quot;a slowdown in the growth of U.S. domestic demand, which in these circumstances is currently rising uncomfortably fast.&quot; Rising demand helps to keep U.S. import levels high. Mr. Lawson warned that &quot;indeed, looking at commodity prices and other indicators, some resurgence of world inflation, albeit not on the scale of the '70s, looks to be a greater danger than world recession.&quot;    Mr. Lawson has never hesitated to call for higher U.S. interest rates to support the dollar or other macroeconomic goals, but he made no prescriptions yesterday, saying only that it was &quot;entirely up to the Americans&quot; to decide how to curb domestic demand.    In his address, Mr. Delors said that &quot;at some stage internal demand in the U.S. will have to slow relative to that in other industrial countries to permit the reduction of the external deficit.&quot; He noted that U.S. consumer demand remained strong despite last autumn's stock market crash, which he said had been expected to yield &quot;a marked slowdown in consumption,&quot; especially in the U.S.    In fact, Mr. Delors hinted it was a shame the stock market crash hadn't hit the U.S. consumer harder. &quot;Despite the costs that this would have involved,&quot; he declared, &quot;it would have helped the adjustment of the external imbalance.&quot;    Both European and U.S. officials called for curbing structural rigidities in all economies and making other microeconomic changes. But the two sides became hung up on one of the most critical microeconomic issues -- agricultural trade.    The U.S., which has proposed in world trade talks that all government farm subsidies be phased out by the year 2000, wants that theme echoed in the communique and wants the OECD to call for the adoption this coming December of a &quot;framework&quot; agreement in world trade talks to move toward that goal.    But Willy DeClercq, the European Community's top trade official, rejected the idea of a phase-out of subsidies, which have been painfully negotiated within the community. Instead, he called for a &quot;progressive diminution&quot; of government aid and said &quot;it is much too early&quot; to say what trade negotiators should agree to in December, when they are scheduled to conduct a &quot;midterm review&quot; of the four-year Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks.    Both sides say they are standing by a strong statement the OECD adopted last year criticizing farm subsidies, and today's communique is likely to incorporate the 1987 language by reference. But the two sides interpret the 1987 declaration differently. </TEXT></DOC>
