As a general rule, exports of animals and plantslisted on Appendix II of the Convention may occur only if a ScientificAuthority has advised a permit-issuing Management Authority that such exportswill not be detrimental to the survival of the species, and if the ManagementAuthority is satisfied that the animals or plants were not obtained inviolation of laws for their protection. Based on documentation presentedfor consideration by the Convention Parties in 1983, the United StatesFish and Wildlife Service (Service) has determined that the American alligatoris listed on Appendix II for reasons of similarity in appearance underArticle II.2(b) of the Convention as well as the potential threat to thespecies survival under Convention Article II.2(a).This notice announces proposed findings by the United States ScientificAuthority and Management Authority on (a) the export of alligators harvestedduring the 1989-1991 taking seasons from certain States previously approvedfor such export for the 1986-1988 harvest seasons, and (b) the additionof Alabama and Mississippi to the list of States approved for the harvestof American alligators for export.

The reason for this approach isthat it is more effective to issue general decisions on the export of allspecimens harvested in a given State and season than to issue such decisionsseparately for each permit application. This is true especially for ConventionAppendix II species that are frequently exported, such as the Americanalligator. On September 2, 1986, (51 FR 31130) and August 15, 1988, (53FR 30682) the Service published rules granting export approval for Americanalligators (<T3>Alligator mississippiensis</T3>) from specified States for the 1986-1988harvest seasons. The purpose of this current proposal is to develop a rulethat will allow the export of legally taken American alligators (hides,meat, parts, and products) for the 1989-1991 harvest years from previouslyapproved States, and from two new States requesting alligator export approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scientific Authority Findings</ITAG>Article II, paragraph 2, of the Convention establishes that Appendix IIshall include:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(a) All species, which although not necessarily now threatened withextinction, may become so unless trade in specimens of such species issubject to strict regulations in order to avoid utilization incompatiblewith their survival; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Other species which must be subject to regulation in order thattrade in specimens of certain species referred to in sub-paragraph (a)of this paragraph may be brought under effective control.''</ITAG>The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problemsof potential threat to the survival of the species [Convention ArticleII.2(a)], and to the similarity of appearance of other crocodilians thatare threatened with possible extinction [Convention Article II.2(b)]. ArticleIV of the Convention requires that an export permit for any specimen ofa species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certain findingshave been made by the Scientific Authority and Management Authority ofthe exporting country. The marking of hides with specified tags, the markingand documentation of shipments of meat and parts, and the issuance of Americanalligator export permits, is considered sufficient to address the issueof identification due to similarity in appearance between American alligatorsand other listed crocodilian species (see Management Authority findingsfor export tagging program specifications). Because the alligator is listedpartly due to the potential threat to its survival, based on previous populationdeclines that have been reversed in most parts of its range in the UnitedStates, the Service must determine if exports will not be detrimental tothe survival of the species itself.The United States Scientific Authority must develop advice on nondetrimentfor the export of Appendix II species in accordance with section 8A ofthe Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. The Act states thatthe Secretary of the Interior, ``shall base such determinations and advicegiven by him under Article IV of the Convention with respect to wildlifeupon the best available biological information derived from professionallyaccepted wildlife management practices; but is not required to make, orrequire any State to make, estimates of population size in making suchdeterminations or giving such advice.''Guidelines developed for Scientific Authority advice on exports of Americanalligator under provisions of Convention Article II.2(a), are summarizedas follows:A. Minimum requirements for biological information:(1) Information on the condition of the population, including trends (themethod of determination to be a matter of State choice), and populationestimates where such information is available;(2) Information on total harvest of the species, each harvest season;(3) Information on distribution of harvest; and(4) Habitat evaluation.B. Minimum requirements for a management program:(1) There should be a controlled harvest, methods and seasons to be a matterof State choice;(2) All hides, meat, and parts should be registered and marked; and(3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the State.In applying these guidelines, the Service considers the following typesof information on the conditions of the population: (a) A current estimate[if such information is available] of the total number of animals in thepreharvest population derived by extrapolating the number of animals perunit area in each of the major habitat types to obtain an estimate of thetotal number of animals where the number of animals per unit is determinedby direct count, by indirect indications of abundance in the State, orby population modeling; (b) a description of ongoing research being conductedto assess the distribution, abundance, or general condition of the speciesin the State, with a summarization of results obtained, including resultsof any analysis of age structure or reproductive parameters; and (c) anassessment of long-term population trends of the species in the State,and the relationship of these trends to habitat conditions, managementpractices, harvest pressure, and/or other factors.Information on anticipated harvest to be considered by the Service includes:(a) The number of animals to be harvested [by county or game managementunit, if data are available at these local levels]; (b) the number of alligatorhunters expected to be licensed; and (c) the time of the harvest season.In the case of the alligator, as with most other wild animals, the resourceis monitored by a variety of techniques that yield information used inevaluating the condition of a population. As these data are accumulatedover time, they reflect trends and call attention to changes in the populations.Habitat information, indices of population size, age and sex structure,and harvest information, are all used to evaluate population status. Althoughthe Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982 provided that populationestimates are not to be required for the approval of Appendix II wildlife,if such estimates are provided by the States seeking export approval, orare otherwise available, they will be considered together with informationof the types listed above in making findings on nondetriment.In addition to considering the effect of trade on species or populationsnative to the United States that are being exported, the Scientific Authoritywill also monitor the status of the American alligator to (1) determinewhether treatment of the alligator remains appropriate, and to (2) detectany significant downward trends in the population and, where necessary,advise on more restrictive export controls in response to these trends.This monitoring and assessment will follow the same procedures adoptedfor other Convention-listed species (see 49 FR 590). The Service will requestinformation on population status and harvest data relevant to the no detrimentfinding process from each export-approved State, as appropriate. When indicatedby available information and a thorough review of accumulated data, a determinationcan then be made about the treatment of this species and whether the managementprogram needs to be adjusted in a particular State.The status of the American alligator has dramatically improved throughoutits range since the species was placed under State and Federal control.One of the primary reasons for this improvement has been the effectivemanagement programs administered by State wildlife agencies. The Serviceexpects these management programs to continue to be effective in conservingthe alligator in the future.The export of American alligators taken in the 1986 through 1988 harvestseasons in certain States was previously approved by the Service (51 FR31130 and 53 FR 30682). In those rules, the Service found that ``currentinformation on the population status, management, and harvest'' availablefrom those States, along with other information collected by the Service,supported a finding that the export of alligators taken in accordance withState regulations in those States and in those harvest seasons would notbe detrimental to the survival of the species in those States approvedfor export.The Service's assessment of the status of the alligator was sufficientto support reclassification of the species throughout its range from threatenedto threatened for similarity of appearance under the Endangered SpeciesAct. The alligators to be harvested in the two new States will be thosewild specimens declared to be a hazard to the human environment and thosespecimens farm-raised for harvest. Additional biological information onthe status of the species has been requested and obtained from these twoStates in support of their request for the harvest of alligators for export.Therefore, based upon information available from the previously approvedStates and on both Alabama and Mississippi now seeking export approval,and in consideration of the tagging requirements stipulated by the ManagementAuthority, the Service proposes to issue Scientific Authority advice infavor of export of 1989-1991 legally harvested alligators from those Statespreviously approved and from Alabama and Mississippi.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management Authority Findings</ITAG>Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under the Convention onlyif the Scientific Authority advises that the exports will not be detrimentalto the survival of the species, and if the Management Authority is satisfiedthat the specimens were not obtained in contravention of laws enacted forthe protection of the involved species. The Service, therefore, must besatisfied that the alligator hide, meat, or product being exported wasnot obtained in violation of State or Federal law in order to allow export.For the American alligator, evidence of legal take is provided by Service-approvedState export tagging and container marking programs. To assist these Stateexport tagging programs, the Service annually contracts for the manufactureand delivery of special Convention animal-hide tags for Service-approved,export-qualified States.In a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, published on April 24, 1986 (51 Fr 15548),the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of a US-CITEStag symbol. This symbol appears on every Service-approved export tag toprovide legal evidence of U.S. export approval for certain species listedon Appendix II of the Convention. Hides marked with tags that lack thisUS-CITES symbol are not legally exportable from the United States.Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State-managedAmerican alligator export programs, under provisions of Convention ArticleIV.2(a), are summarized as follows:(1) Current State alligator trapping, hide tagging, meat and parts processing,marking, and shipping regulations must be on file with the Office of ManagementAuthority;(2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat and parts packing seal, partstag, and specifications of the State's standard meat and parts package/containermust be on file with the Office of Management Authority;(3) The hide export tag must be durable and permanently locking, and mustshow US-CITES logo, State of origin, year of take, species, and be seriallyunique;(4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag or seal must be applied bythe State to all hides, meat, or parts within a minimum time after takeor processing, as specified by State law, and such time should be as shortas possible to minimize movement of untagged hides, meat, or parts; (5) The tags or seals must be permanently attached, as mandated by theState; (6) All alligator harvesters and processors must be State registered; (7) All alligator hide, meat, and parts dealers must be State registered;(8) All State-registered alligator harvesters, processors, and dealersmust make available their alligator harvest and commerce data to the Stateon at least an annual basis, as specified by the State;; (9) State-registered alligator dealers adn State licensed harvesters authorizedto attach export tags must account for tags received and must return unusedtags to the State, within a specified time after taking season closes;and; (10) Fully manufactured hide products may be exported from the United Stateswhen State-applied Convention export tags, removed from hides containedin the product, are surrendered to the Service prior to export. Based upon (1) the finding of non-detriment by the Scientific Authority,and (2) information available from both the previously export-approvedStates and from Alabama and Mississippi, now seeking alligator export approvalfor the first time, the Service proposes to issue Management Authorityapproval for the export of 1989-1991 legally harvested alligators fromthose States previously approved for such export and for Alabama and Mississippi.<ITAG tagnum="84">Multiyear Findings </ITAG>The Service has monitored existing State programs for the American alligatorin most of the previously approved States for many years and expects theseStates will continue to satisfy Convention requirements. States seekingfor the first time to establish a harvest program for alligators shouldapply for Convention export approval no later than January 2 of the yearthey plan to initate such a program. To ensure that export-approved Statesmaintain successful programs and that export is not detrimental to thesurvival of the species, the Service plans to continue annual monitoringof State management and export marking programs through evaluation of annualreports from the States and export reports from U.S. ports. Annual Stateprogram reports are due in the Office of the Management Authority (addressgiven above) no later than May 31 of each year. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Findings </ITAG>The Service proposes to find that the status of the species and State programis such that the 1989-1991 harvests of American alligators for export willnot be detrimental to the survival of the species. Accordingly, the Serviceproposes to approve exports of 1989-1991 harvested alligators from theStates previously approved for export on the grounds that both ScientificAuthority and Management Authority export requirements are satisfied. TheService also proposes to approve the addition of both Alabama and Mississippito the list of States approved for the 1989-1991 harvest of alligatorsfor export on the grounds that the alligator management and export programsin these States also satisfy the requirements of both the Scientific Authorityand the Management Authority. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service requests comments on these proposed findings. Final findingswill take into consideration the comments and any additional informationreceived, and such consideration might lead to final findings that differfrom this proposal. The proposal is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The primary author is Mr. S. Ronald Singer, Office ofManagement Authority. <T4>Note.</T4>_The Department had previously determined that the exportof alligators of various States taken in the 1986-1988 harvest seasonswas not a major Federal action that would significantly affect the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of theNational Environmental Policy Act, therefore, the preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement was not required (49 FR 1058). Because these proposedfindings do not significantly differ from the previous export findings,the Service believes that the previous determination not to prepare anEnvironmental Impact Assessment on export of alligators taken during specifiedharvest seasons in certain States remains valid. The Department had alsopreviously determined that such harvest was not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and did not have a significant economic affect on a substantialnumber of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601). Because the existing rule treats exports on a State-by-State basisand proposes to approve export in accordance with State management/exportprograms, the final rule will have little effect on small entities in andof itself. This proposed rule does not contain any information collectionrequirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budgetunder 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 23 </ITAG>Endangered and threatened wildlife, Exports, Fish, Imports, Plants (agriculture),Treaties. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 23_ENDANGERED SPECIES CONVENTION </ITAG>Accordingly, the Service proposes to amend Part 23 of Title 50, Code ofFederal Regulations, as set forth below:1.
