BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In less than a year on its own, Oryx Energy Co.changed its name, announced plans to build the first skyscraper inDallas in years and embarked on its long-promised internationalexpansion.   Oryx has agreed to pay $1.31 billion for some North Sea and otherexploration assets of British Petroleum Co. PLC, both companies saidThursday.   Besides the North Sea, the reserves are in Indonesia, Dubai,Ecuador, Colombia, Gabon and Italy. Oryx estimates the total provedand probable reserves to be about 405 million barrels, increasingthe company's oil and gas reserves by 30 percent.   ``This is precisely the type of acquisition that meets our statedgoals,'' said Oryx Chairman Robert P. Hauptfuhrer. ``In terms ofsize, it is significant but well within our means. These propertiesare a strategic fit for Oryx Energy and create a balanced portfolioworldwide.''   On the New York Stock Exchange, Oryx fell $2.25 to $37.87{ inactive trading on a generally down day on the market.   Hauptfuhrer said production from the former BP properties will beabout 34 million barrels next year, most of it from five North Seafields, remaining stable until 1994 when an increase to 36 millionbarrels is projected.   The purchase will be paid for through new debt, which will beretired through cash flow, some divestiture and reduced capitalspending.   For the first half of this year, Oryx had net earnings of $119million on revenues of $610 million, improvements over a loss of$278 million on $664 million in revenue in the first six months of1988. The 1988 period included a $395 million writedown of oil andgas properties and other charges.   Oryx, North America's largest independent oil and gas company,became a separate entity on Nov. 1, 1988 when it was spun off fromSun Co. Formerly known as Sun Exploration and Production Co., Oryxchanged its name on May 3 to reflect its independence.   Since being spun off, Oryx executives have frequently said theywanted the company to become an ``important player,'' and at theannual meeting last May, Hauptfuhrer promised shareholders, ``we areready to seize the appropriate opportunity to make a significantacquisition ... (but) we're not going to be stampeded into making adeal.''   Oryx also has worked to extend its domestic resources, and hasreplaced about 90 percent of its reserves. It also recentlyannounced plans to drill as many as 85 wells in Texas next year ifregulators approve the company's horizontal drilling operations.   Off the oil field, Oryx announced in July it would occupy a new26- to 28-story office tower on the city's north side. The building,which Oryx will lease, is the first announcement of a new skyscraperin Dallas in a number of years, and comes despite an abundance ofempty office space.</TEXT></DOC>
