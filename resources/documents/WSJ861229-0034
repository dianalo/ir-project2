This is far from what passes for conventional wisdom these days. Most of the analysts in several recent surveys predicted that the economy will remain lethargic for at least the next six months, with interest rates edging lower.    But that only makes contrarians even more convinced that borrowing costs have hit bottom. They say several recent government reports indicate that the economy's long-awaited rebound has begun. They also predict inflation will increase and that the Federal Reserve won't ease credit any further.    Jerry L. Jordan, senior vice president and chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, says he expects interest rates to climb about one percentage point in 1987, with the larger part of the increase coming in the second half. The Federal Reserve's &quot;very accommodative&quot; monetary policy thus far, combined with declines in interest rates, energy prices and the dollar, &quot;all go in the direction of stimulating domestic production,&quot; he says.    Mr. Jordan, a former member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that the economy is expanding at a vigorous 4.1% annual rate this quarter, after adjusting for inflation. That would be a strong pickup from its 2.8% annual rate in the third quarter. For 1987, he expects inflation-adjusted growth of 3% in the first quarter, 3.4% in the second, 3.8% in the third and 4% in the fourth.    A still more optimistic forecast comes from David A. Levine, chief economist at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. He predicts the economy will expand at a sizzling 6% to 8% annual rate, after inflation, in each of the next three quarters.    Mr. Levine also expects considerably higher borrowing costs. He says the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, now about 7 3/8%, will rise about one percentage point within three months and by a further three-quarters of a point by mid-year.    Employment statistics released by the Labor Department in the past few months &quot;show things already look a lot better&quot; for the economy, Mr. Levine says. &quot;I think the economy has in fact already accelerated,&quot; he says.    Several of the other forecasters who expect higher interest rates disagree strongly with Mr. Levine's predictions, which were by far the most optimistic in a recent survey of 46 analysts by Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, a monthly newsletter edited by Robert J. Eggert of Sedona, Ariz. Mr. Levine's critics say he has been predicting an economic boom and higher interest rates for more than a year.    Nonetheless, Mr. Levine says he remains confident that the boom finally is coming. &quot;The conditions were ripe for a boom a year ago, but it was blocked by a serious further deterioration in foreign trade,&quot; he says, adding that he believes that will prove to be the last worsening of the trade balance in the current cycle.    Further evidence of the economy's strength is likely to emerge from a Commerce Department report tomorrow on the November index of leading economic indicators. Many analysts expect it to say that the index, the government's main economic forecasting gauge, rose a strong 0.8% last month. That would follow a 0.6% rise in October.    But the leading indicators report may be misleading. Many economists insist that the new tax law will have a depressing effect on the economy next year, especially in the first quarter. Some also predict that inflation will remain under control despite a recent rise in oil prices.    Next year &quot;may well be the year in which we crack inflationary fears,&quot; says James F. Smith, chief economist in the bureau of business research of the University of Texas in Austin. &quot;The Federal Reserve has plenty of room to cut the discount rate,&quot; he says.    Mr. Smith predicts that the Fed will reduce the discount rate three times in the next six months, reducing the fee on loans to banks and savings institutions to 4% from the 5 1/2% level reached in August. He also predicts that banks will lower their prime, or base, rates on corporate loans to around 5 1/2% or 6% from the current 7 1/2%.    In the credit markets Friday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose slightly to a price of 101 31/32 from 101 30/32 Wednesday. The yield remained at about 7.34%. The price of the government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 declined slightly to 101 7/32 from 101 8/32 Wednesday, leaving the yield at about 7.07%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 0.29 points Friday to close at 1428.67. Its high for the day was 1429.31, and its low was 1427.92. Shearson Lehman's index has risen this year nearly 200 points, or about 16%.    Interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasury bills Friday were unchanged from Wednesday. The rate on the latest 13-week bills closed at 5.58% bid, and the rate on the latest 26-week bills was 5.60%.    The Federal Reserve's weekly money supply statistics, which normally are released on Thursday afternoons, will be issued this afternoon. </TEXT></DOC>
