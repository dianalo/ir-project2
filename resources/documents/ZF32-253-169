 Version 2.0's speed improvements took the program fromthe pedestrian to the airborne, however, and the new 4D Compiler takes thepackage into hyperspace.andM;Compiled, Not Interpreted.andP;  With an uncompiled 4D application, the Macactually spends more time converting your code into machine language than itdoes performing tasks.andP;  Languages that perform this stepwise conversion arecalled intepreted.andP;  The 4D Compiler preorganizes your application intomachine language, bypassing the interpreter and thus speeding up theapplication.andM;The 4D Compiler strips out everything you can read from your application,including the design environment.andP;  It creates and works on a copy of yourdatabase; your original source file is left intact.andP;  Whenever you makechanges to the source file, you can recompile as needed.andP;  The compilerdoesn't touch your data, and you can use the same data file simultaneouslywith a compiled and an uncompiled structure.andM;Compiling does not speed up disk- or network-access operations, onlyuser-defined procedures.andP;  A routine that loops through an array and changesthe values of variables shows a dramatic performance improvement, but aroutine that loops through and updates records in the current selection isnot significantly fater.andP;  You can probably see some improvement in the redrawtimes for output layouts that contain a layout procedure.andM;Using the compiler to develop a database requires more consistency thandeveloping for the interpreter.andP;  For example, the interpreter lets you assign0 to a variable called vTemp in one place and A to vTemp in a differentplace, but the compiler doesn't.andP;  The compiler will complain if you try toredefine variables.andP;  Generally, you won't produce a compiled application onyou first try, but the 4D Compiler provides a wealth of information as itattempts to convert your application.andP;  to help trace you mistakes, the 4DCompiler can optionally generate a symbol table and an error file.andP;  These twodiagnostic tools greatly simplify the process of making an applicationcompiler-ready.andM;The symbol table tells you where the compiler first defined every globalvariable in your application and gives you the variables' data types.andP;  Italso describes all the local variables and parameters associated withprocedures and functions.andP;  The symbol table can tell you a lot about howtidily you use variables and more.andM;You can open and print the error file with a word processor, or you can useit in conjunction with 4D's design environment.andP;  When 4D sees an error filein the same folder with your structure file, it opens the error file andinstalls new menu items on the Use menu.andP;  The Next Compiler Error commandopens each offending procedure and script and highlights the troublesomeline.andM;The Range Checking option handles mistakes such as indirect reference to the100the element of an array that has only 25 elements.andP;  Without rangechecking, you compiled application would simply crash rather than putting upa courteous error message.andP;  Range checking slows your compiled application,so you should add your own range-checking statements with an eye towardturning off Range Checking at some point.andM;You can set the compiler for script-manager compatibility to support writingforms such as Kanji.andP;  The Processor Type choice can further optimize certainroutines by tailoring them for specific 68000-family processors.andM;You can now blend 4D Runtime into your compiled application, creating adouble-clickable application, with your own icons.andP;  This feature should make&quot;4th party&quot; developers salivate.andP;  A new 4D 2.1 command, Set About, lets youspecify the text for the About menu item on the Apple menu and the routinethat runs when that item is chosen.andP;  A 50-pixel region at the top of yourAbout box tells the user that the application was created with 4D: Everythingelse about your application is your own.andM;The 4D Compiler lets you create a project file that remembers your compilersetup options and your source file.andP;  You can double-click on the project fileand get right to compiling.andM;The compiler and 4D both make good use of the Mac RAM cache, and they workvery well under MultiFinder.andP;  Compile times can be dramatically reduced withthe RAM cache turned on.andP;  You can also get work done in another applicationwhile the 4D Compiler chugs along on your 4D project.andM;I often run 4D 2.1, the 4D Compiler, and Word simultaneously.andP;  That way, Ican step between errors, recompile at will, and review the symbol table asneeded.andP;  Word's Open Read Only option is handy -- you don't have to worryabout the compiler finding the symbol table busy!andM;The compiler has a couple of quirks I would like to see changed.andP;  The NextCompiler Error command does not handle general errors.andP;  You'll want to keepthe compiler open or print the error file to locate and fix those errors.andO;Also, Next Compiler Error doesn't skip warnings.andP;  Although errors prevent thecompiler from creating a compiled structure file, warnings are notnecessarily a problem.andM;General errors can prevent the 4D Compiler from compiling your project, soyou're likely to be confounded when the error count increases after you'vefixed the general errors.andP;  Sometimes, the compiler error message simply reads&quot;Syntax Error&quot; -- not a particularly enlightening message.andP;  If an erroroccurs that's caused when a parameter of the wrong type is passed to aprocedure or function, the compiler doesn't tell you which is the  offendingparameter.andM;It's a good strategy to recompile fairly frequently.andP;  This provides the egofeedback of seeing the error count drop and keeps the error informationcurrent.andP;  If you've got 200 errors, don't slog through them all at once.andO;Changing one line of code can sometimes wipe out five errors.andP;  As you fixproblems, the Next Compiler Error command continues to take you to relatederrors that have been fixed.andM;Unfortunately, the 4D Compiler is copy-protected.andP;  It asks for the key diskon ther first launch after any install and asks for the disk again randomly(roughly once every 40 launches).andP;  If you're using the 4D Compiler at homeand at work, the only safe method of operation is to carry the key disk withyou, which means a higher probability of corruption.andP;  With key-diskprotection, there really isn't much you can do to protect yourself from beingaccidentally locked out at a crucial moment.andM;The Bottom Line.andP;  At a list price of $1,000, the 4D Compiler isn't a productthat most users are going to rush out and buy -- much less use.andP;  This is aserious developer's tool.andP;  But it would be wrong to assume that the 4DCompiler will have no impact on average users.andP;  With the spate of new4D-based applications that are sure to emerge as a result of the compiler'srelease, users who otherwise might never even consider looking at 4th Dimensimay find themselves becoming productive using a 4D application.andP;  Who knows --the 4D Compiler may finally help give the Mac the one thing it has alwayslacked: a de facto relational-database standard.andP;  It's interesting to watch4D evolve, incorporating what is clearly user-inspired features.andP;  The 4DCompiler and 4D 2.1 provide a sophisticated development environment thatbegins to rival language tools but doesn't require the skills of a MacAppdeveloper to master.andP;  In a way, the compiler has completely stolen the showfrom 4D.andP;  This package is more important than just about any other 4D-relatedtool I've seen so far.andP;  If you're serious about 4th Dimension development,you can't afford to miss it.andM;4th Dimension 2.1andM;Several few features in 4th Dimension 2.1 are not related to the compiler.andO;One useful new feature is the Open Data File command, which lets you supportmultiple files in the Single User mode.andP;  The Automatic Relations command letsyou temporarily treat all &quot;manual&quot; relations as automatic ones, which isparticularly useful with the Search Editor and the Label Editor.andM;4D 2.1 features Multi-Transactions that are slightly slower than the originaltransactions, but all users on a network can now have a transaction going atthe same time.andM;If you use pointers, you're likely to enjoy the Self and Nil functions.andP;  Selfreturns a pointer to the object it was used in, making code even moreportable than before.andP;  Nil is a function that checks a pointer to see whetherit points at nothing (andgt;andgt;[]).andM;Although it's preferable to have more memory (I recommend 1,500K), 4D 2.1 cannow run in as little as 500K.andP;  In tight memory situations, 4D swaps code fromdisk more often, which makes it slower, but at least it runs.andP;  With thislatest version, ACIUS keeps 4D at the top of the Mac-database heap.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
