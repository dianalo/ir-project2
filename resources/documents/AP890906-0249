The plea on Tuesday by Robert M. Freeman, the former head of riskarbitrage at the prestigious investment house, was part of anagreement with federal prosecutors announced Aug. 17. Risk arbitrageis the speculative investment in stocks of possible takeover targets.   In entering the plea, Freeman became one of the most prominentpeople to plead guilty in the aftermath of the Ivan Boesky insidertrading scandal that rocked Wall Street nearly three years ago.   Freeman admitted that he used inside information when he orderedthe sale of Beatrice Companies Inc. stock in January 1986.   ``I knew it was wrong at the time, sir,'' Freeman told U.S.District Judge Pierre Leval.   He could be sentenced to up to five years in prison, $1.86million in fines and additional restitution. Leval scheduledsentencing for Nov. 16.   The 47-year-old securities professional read a seven-pagestatement that detailed the events on which his guilty plea wasbased.   He said he received confirmation of a rumor from Martin Siegel,then a vice president at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., about a problem withthe planned leveraged buyout of Beatrice by the investment firm ofKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   ``When Martin Siegel confirmed the rumor I did not believe thathe was authorized by KKR to do so, and I knew I was not entitled totrade on that information,'' Freeman said.   After the conversation on Jan. 8, 1986, he said he ordered thesale of certain Beatrice securities in a company account, in acustomer's account and in his own personal account.   The government alleges that the sales resulted in the avoidanceof $930,000 in trading losses.   Siegel, who later worked for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., wasimplicated in the Wall Street insider trading scandal by Boesky, nowserving a three-year prison term. Siegel pleaded guilty in February1987 to securities fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with thegovernment.   He implicated Freeman, who was taken into custody at his officein front of shocked co-workers.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano announced Freeman's plea agreementlast month.   Freeman resigned from Goldman Sachs before his plea agreement wasannounced. He said in a letter to his employer that he decided toplead guilty to end what he called the nightmare that the 2{-yearinvestigation had caused him and his family.   His plea agreement prohibits Romano's office from bringing anyadditional criminal charges against Freeman but does not precludethe Securities and Exchange Commission from seeking civil penalties.   At the court proceeding, Leval asked Assistant U.S. Attorney JohnMcEnany how much restitution Freeman faces.   McEnany said the exact figure had not been calculated, but withprompting from the judge, said it could go as high as $50 million.   Freeman's attorney, Robert B. Fiske Jr., said McEnany'sestimation was ``off the wall.'' Fiske said Freeman may only have topay back $466,000, which is the amount of losses he personallyavoided in the transactions.</TEXT></DOC>
