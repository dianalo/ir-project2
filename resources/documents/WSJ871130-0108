The 8,500 workers, who include baggage handlers and mechanics, are seeking a new collective agreement to replace a contract that expired June 28. The main issue in dispute is the union's demand for the indexing of pensions to increases in the cost of living.    The state-owned airline said that it will begin laying off its 7,500 remaining unionized employees, including flight crews and reservation agents, today for the duration of the strike.    Air Canada provides 48% of scheduled airline service in Canada.    The workers, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, first walked off their jobs Thursday at Toronto, forcing Air Canada to cancel most of its flights at Canada's busiest airport. The strike later spread to Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouver, British Columbia, which resulted in the airline's decision Friday to halt all operations and lock out the non-striking workers.    Pierre Jeanniot, the airline's president and chief executive officer, said management staff will continue to provide services to other airlines with which it has contracts for ground support.    The union reached a tentative agreement with Air Canada in September for a new two-year pact that would have resulted in wage increases of 4% in each year, but it was rejected by union members. The union is now seeking a 7.2% wage boost in the first year but its major demand is for pension indexation.    The average hourly wage at the expiration of the last contract was 15.03 Canadian dollars ($11.48) an hour.    A spokeswoman for Canadian Airlines International, Canada's second-largest airline, said that the airline was adding flights when possible and was substituting larger aircraft on some runs to handle extra traffic. Canadian Airlines is a unit of Pacific Western Airlines Corp., Calgary, Alberta.    Ron Fontaine, chairman of the union's negotiating committee, said he doesn't expect a quick settlement of the dispute unless Air Canada makes concessions on the pension issue. A spokesman for Air Canada said yesterday that no negotiations were planned.    Air Canada's Mr. Jeanniot said that if inflation protection for pensions were applied to all Air Canada employees, it would cost the airline an additional 70 million Canadian dollars ($53.5 million) a year and make the airline uncompetitive.    Robert Aitchison, a union shop steward at the company's overhaul base in Dorval, Quebec, said that employees also want a larger wage increase than that offered by the airline, noting that Air Canada has been reporting record earnings. In the six months ended June 30, Air Canada reported net income of 59.8 million Canadian dollars ($45.7 million) compared with a loss of 29.4 million dollars a year ago. Revenue rose 9.4% to 1.51 billion dollars from 1.38 billion dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
