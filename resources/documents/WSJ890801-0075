Directors of Eljer, a building-products manufacturer based in Plano, Texas, said they will not consider the Nortek bid until after they review an updated strategic plan for Eljer at a meeting Aug. 15.    In the meantime, Eljer said it lowered the threshold at which its stockholders can purchase discounted stock to thwart a hostile acquisition. Holders will be able to purchase a specified amount of stock at 50% of market value if a bidder acquires 10% or more of the company's shares. Previously, holders could make discount purchases when a bidder acquired 20% or more.    Nortek, a Providence, R.I., maker of products for the building, aerospace and electrical industries, offered $32.50 a share for Eljer stock in a July 14 letter to the board. Nortek currently holds 7.9% of Eljer stock and has sought clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to purchase more than 50%.    Eljer was spun off from Household International Inc. April 14. In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Eljer shares closed at $32.50, down 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
