Weil described Blesch as &quot;your basic quiet, competent engineertype&quot; who kept records of which villages the volunteers had visited.;   Details of the crash were sketchy. But Crews and Blesch had gone to Ceracahuiby truck the week before their death to scout out a potential landing stripfor small planes.;    Weil said the plane was nearly level when it hit theground, leading to speculation that Blesch, regarded as a fine pilot, wasmaking a low pass over the field.;    The group had left its hotel in LosMochis early Thursday, and Schweikert had called home to say the four wouldcheck in again when they reached the border on the return to California.;   The plane was discovered Friday. Because of the mountainous terrain and lackof telephones, word of the crash wasn't received until Saturday.;    Amemorial service is scheduled next Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the All SaintsChurch Parish Hall in Palo Alto. Plans are also under way for a memorialservice at Union Presbyterian Church in Los Altos, where Blesch and Crews weremarried.;    Meanwhile, Flying Doctors intends to dispatch five planes toMexico on Thursday morning. &quot;Some people say, 'Shouldn't you cancel the trip?'&quot; Weil said. &quot;I can only say, no. What better memorial can we offer thesepeople than to continue the work they were engaged in?&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SCOTT HERHOLD, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910410  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  427  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 10, 199100101198,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
