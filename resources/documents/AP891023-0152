In a major foreign policy speech in the Soviet legislature,Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze also criticized thedecision by Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1979 to send Soviet soldiers intoAfghanistan. He said it involved ``gross violations of our ownlaws, intra-party and civil norms and ethics.''   ``A decision that had very serious consequences for our countrywas made behind the back of the party and the people,'' he said.   About the military alliances, Shevardnadze said: ``We areprepared to head toward the dissolution of the military-politicalblocs in Europe on a mutual basis,'' but added that ``all ourobligations remain in force'' despite recent changes in EasternEurope.   Poland and Hungary have moved away from one-party Communist rulein recent months and the Soviet Union has made no move to stopthem. Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union would observe strictprinciples of non-intervention and ``absolute freedom of choice.''   He said the Soviet Union is prepared to liquidate all foreignbases and withdraw its military forces to its own territory by theyear 2000. What the conditions for such a withdrawal would be wasnot clear.   Shevardnadze said the radar station in Siberia would bedismantled. He said it took Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government fouryears to determine that its location violated the 1972 treaty, asWestern arms experts contended.   As the Soviet Union tried to move forward on arms treaties basedon the ABM pact, ``there stood the station, the size of an Egyptianpyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of the ABMtreaty,'' Shevardnadze declared.   Shevardnadze said that the decision to dismantle the giant,phased-array radar at Krasnoyarsk was criticized within the countryas going against the Soviet Union's interest.   In fact, he said, ``We are saving the ABM treaty and opening theway to the conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons, and we'regaining the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the questionof American installations in Greenland and England which weremodernized, as we understand, in violation of the treaty.''   The United States has claimed the treaty does not apply to itsmodernization of the stations in Thule, Greenland, and FylingdalesMoor, England, because they were in place before the ABM accord wassigned.   In Washington, the Bush administration welcomed Shevardnadze'sadmission.   ``It reflects a different kind of mindset,'' said a U.S.official. ``It's encouraging. It builds a degree of confidence, itbuilds a degree of trust,'' he told reporters at a briefing on anarms control speech Secretary of State James A. Baker III wasmaking in San Francisco. Ground rules of the briefing prevent useof the official's name.   After Shevardnadze and Baker met last month in Jackson Hole,Wyo., they said in a joint statement: ``The Soviet Union statedthat, guided by its long-standing goal of strengthening the ABMtreaty regime, it had decided to completely dismantle theKrasnoyarsk radar station. The U.S. side expressed satisfactionwith this announcement.''   Shevardnadze, in a news conference at Jackson Hole, toldreporters: `We have decided to fully dismantle that facility, andwe expect that the U.S. side, too, will act in order to remove ourconcern with respect to its radars in Greenland and Great Britain.''   The Soviet government has offered repeatedly to turn over theSiberian radar to a civilian agency and partially dismantle it, butalways stopped short of admitting the station violated provisionsof the ABM treaty.   The United States rejected as unsatisfactory any plan short ofcomplete dismantling of the station, saying the ABM treatyprohibited the deployment of large radar stations capable of givingearly warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the peripheryof the U.S. or Soviet territory.   The Krasnoyarsk station is deep within Soviet Siberia, severalhundred miles north of the Chinese border.   The dispute was among the differences that soured U.S.-Sovietarms control talks for years.   It was not the first time high-placed Soviets have disclosedthat the decision to intervene in Afghanistan was made by a smallcircle around the late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. But it hadnot previously been characterized by a government spokesman as anoutright violation of law.   Shevardnadze noted that for the first time in many years, ``Nota single Soviet soldier is participating _ nor, I'm sure, willparticipate _ in military actions anywhere in the world.''   He said the Soviet Union is prepared to liquidate all itsforeign bases and withdraw its military forces to within its ownterritory by the year 2000. It was not clear what the conditionwould be for such a withdrawal.</TEXT></DOC>
