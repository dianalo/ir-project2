Or else.    If the trend persists, said Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole, &quot;We're going to have to do something about campaign finance reform. No doubt about it.&quot;    Sen. Dole and several of his colleagues -- some of whom are publicly flirting with the idea of abolishing PACs -- last Thursday summoned 74 business PAC leaders to a Washington hotel ballroom for an unusually direct appeal for money. One who attended said he knew as soon as he walked in at 9 a.m. that the Republicans were angry: &quot;There was nothing to eat and there wasn't any coffee.&quot;    During the 45 minutes that followed, Sen. Dole and other Republicans complained that too much business money is flowing to Democrats. They handed out to each PAC manager a &quot;candidate commitment form&quot; listing 10 GOP Senate candidates in need of money, with each name accompanied by blanks for donors to fill in the amount already given, a &quot;new pledge&quot; and the &quot;date to be received.&quot;    &quot;They wanted the money in 10 days,&quot; recalled one lobbyist. To the relief of many, nobody collected the sheets afterward.    Sen. Dole complained that business PACs seem ungrateful for the unpopular pro-business positions Republicans have taken in opposition to an increase in the minimum wage, against advance notification of plant closings, and particularly against putting limits on the amount of money congressional candidates may accept from PACs.    Republican senators filibustered for months and blocked a Democratic bill to limit spending by congressional candidates and to cap their total PAC receipts. Meanwhile, PACs increased their giving to Democrats and cut donations to Republicans.    Democratic Senate candidates received $16 million from PACs in the 18 months ended June 30, an increase of 36% from the like period in 1985-86, according to the latest figures from the Federal Election Commission. PAC donations to GOP Senate candidates, on the other hand, dropped 22% to $11 million.    During the period, PACs sponsored by labor unions gave 93% of their money to Democrats running for the House and Senate, continuing their customary support of the party. But what rankles Republicans is that business PACs gave more than half their funds to Democrats -- 53% of corporate PAC gifts and 59% of trade-association PAC money.    &quot;While we're fighting for all their programs, they're busy writing checks to all the liberals,&quot; Sen. Dole said in an interview over the weekend. &quot;I didn't understand it.&quot;    Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a leader of the filibuster against the PAC-limit bill, also expressed displeasure during Thursday's meeting. &quot;I said, 'Look, we're the people out there fighting for the free enterprise system,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;It is very frustrating to see people who are in sync with us philosophically out supporting people who vote against them 80% of the time.&quot;    Later Thursday, Sen. McConnell spoke on the Senate floor about an article, appearing that day on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, that proposed outlawing PAC donations, publicly subsidizing political parties and removing limits on the amounts parties may donate to their own candidates. &quot;The article makes a lot of sense, and I intend to pursue some of its recommendations further in the next Congress,&quot; the senator said.    Among about 10 Republican senators at Thursday's meeting was GOP Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who had said publicly a few days earlier that he wouldn't mind abolishing PACs as part of a broad, bipartisan revision of campaign-finance laws.    Members of the audience didn't react or ask questions at the meeting. &quot;There were a lot of people in the room checking the polish on their shoes,&quot; one participant recalled. Sen. McConnell said, &quot;A number of people came up to me afterward and said, 'You know, you're right, and we're going to help.'&quot;    But as invitations to Thursday's meeting were going out, the PAC of the National Association of Realtors was starting to run $158,000 of radio and television ads supporting Democratic Sen. John Melcher of Montana, whose Republican opponent Conrad Burns is at the top of the list of candidates for whom the GOP was soliciting PAC money.    During the 18 months ended June 30, Sen. Melcher had collected $586,000 from PACs, including sizable donations from those of the American Bankers Association, Amoco Corp. and the Chicago Board of Trade's commodity brokers. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns reported getting only $10,255 from PACs. </TEXT></DOC>
