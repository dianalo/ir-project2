 People want WYSIWYG color: color on thescreen that matches the printed piece.andP;  That requires calibration, andcalibration is a serious problem in color systems.andM;High-end color systems have always had procedures for calibrating the monitorto the ink/paper/press combination.andP;  These procedures have often been tediousand, in the end, unsatisfactory.andP;  It has not been possible to achieve a good,reliable match between the screen and the printed piece.andM;The lack of a match has meant that the operators of color systems havelearned to ignore the colors displayed on the monitor.andP;  Instead, they haverelied on the ability of the systems to report dot-percentage values(&quot;on-screen densitometer readings&quot;) for image areas where they know what theexpected values should be.andP;  For appearance checks, they have relied onhard-copy proofs.andP;  Color corrections are then done with reference to theproofs, &quot;by the numbers.&quot;andM;In short, many operators of Scitex, Crosfield, Hell, and similar systems havelearned not to &quot;trust the screen.&quot;andP;  Everyone accepts that while a faithfulscreen image would be a big advantage, real fidelity is not possible.andP;  Andthe possibility of an image called to the screen at one location matching acopy called to the screen somewhere else has seemed completely out of reach.andM;That is the status quo, but it seems about to change, and the change is beingpushed by the desktop market.andP;  People doing color work on microcomputers havenot been trained to distrust the screen, and they are not prepared to hearthat the colors they see on the screen should be ignored.andP;  They may yet getthe color fidelity they want, or at least a reasonable approximation.andM;Helpful trends.andP;  Several trends are helping to move the industry towards morefaithful color.andP;  The first has to do with standards.andP;  The makers of colorperipherals are involved in developing color standards suitable for theprinting industry.andP;  The second trend has to do with the displays and outputdevices themselves, which are being designed to produce predictable,repeatable color.andM;Both displays and proofing devices have made great progress in these areasrecently.andP;  They are also increasingly calibrated to accepted standards at thefactory, and in some cases in the field as well.andP;  (We will discuss some ofthese products in a moment.)andP;  The third trend, not widely recognized, has todo with color printing.andM;Over the past ten years, the practice of color printing has changed.andP;  Thechange has been brought about in part because of improvements in the colorseparation process.andP;  In the sixties and seventies, color separations weremostly done by camera work and were often difficult to control precisely.andO;Therefore, the best color work depended on the skill of the press operator.andO;Inking levels would be adjusted on the press to compensate for inadequaciesin the separations.andM;When computer-based color systems were introduced to this type ofenvironment, it was impossible to calibrate them accurately.andP;  Calibration toa given set of inking levels was perhaps possible, but press conditionschanged with each job.andP;  Neither the display nor the off-press proof was areliable guide to the printed job.andM;At the same time, a trend toward standardizing press conditions swept theindustry.andP;  The idea was that, for a given press, there was a set of idealconditions.andP;  Departures from these conditions could be detected via a printedcontrol strip and a densitometer, and corrective action could be taken.andO;System Brunner is an example of this approach.andP;  With press conditionscontrolled, it became possible to predict what a given set of separationswould really look like when printed.andP;  Accurate proofs became possible, and itbecame possible to think about more accurate displays.andM;While completely accurate monitors are impossible with current technology(since video monitors cannot display some colors that can be printed), it maybe possible to come quite close.andP;  The products discussed below, and theirsuccessors, will help us find out just how close.andM;Calibrating the monitorandM;Barco.andP;  Barco was first to address the issue of end-user tools for monitorcalibration.andP;  Barco's Calibrator monitor, with a sensor that can be attachedto the screen with a suction cup during calibration, was introduced at theIPEX show in the fall of 1988.andP;  The monitor was shown as an OEM product.andP;  AMacintosh version, for the end-user market, was introduced in June (see Vol.andO;18, No.andP;  19/20, page 39 of the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems).andP;  Thisproduct was on display in San Francisco.andM;The Barco Calibrator is designed to achieve a fixed relationship between theRGB signals it receives and the color produced on the display.andP;  Thisrelationship is established through the calibration procedure and maintainedby carefully designed electronics that compensate for various sources ofcolor drift.andP;  The calibration process also adjusts the monitor for geometricdistortion and allows the user to specify the whitelight &quot;color temperature.&quot;andO;(The standard whites for television applications and for graphic artsapplications are significantly different colors.)andP;  The colors on the Barcoscreen are mathematically tied to CIE standards, so vendors of interfaces andsoftware packages can know exactly what colors will be produced by a givenset of outputs.andP;  This had not been true with previous products, so itrepresented a major step forward toward WYSIWYG color.andP;  The calibrationcapability also makes it easy to keep multiple displays, at the same ordifferent sites, in calibration with each other.andP;  The Barco product is notfor the casual color user, though: the monitor costs $6,700 and the sensorcosts $1,960.andM;Radius.andP;  At the show, Barco got its first competition.andP;  Radius introduced thePrecisionColor Calibrator for the Macintosh.andP;  The Radius device uses asensor, also held on the screen by a suction cup, which works with associatedsoftware to get the screen into calibration.andP;  The initial goal is toreproduce Pantone's colors correctly on the screen.andP;  The calibration toolswork with Radius' 8-, 16- and 24-bit display systems, as well as Apple's8-bit color system.andP;  (They also work with the Radius Gray Scale display.)andM;Radius will probably add support for other display systems.andM;Unlike the Barco monitor, which makes adjustments to the RGB video signalscoming from the computer, the Radius approach is to adjust values in alook-up table on the display board in the computer.andP;  Thus, Barco's monitorcan work with any computer or display subsystem, but the Radius software mustrun in the host computer (only Macintosh initially) and be able to makeadjustments to the display hardware.andM;Radius has not built any special antidrift features into their monitors(which are Sony Trinitrons), and the company does not yet have enoughexperience with the calibration in the field to say how often it will beneeded.andP;  But measurements suggest that the monitors are very stable,especially after they have been turned on for at least an hour.andM;Radius does not tie its screen colors directly to CIE values, but it does doso indirectly: it ties the screen representation of Pantone's colors to theCIE values for those colors.andP;  Radius has focused initially on Pantone'scolors because accurate representation of them is so often needed in printingand publishing.andM;In working with Pantone's colors, Radius has discovered a curious thing:Pantone's colors generated from PageMaker differ in their RGB values (andtherefore their screen appearance) from those generated in Quark Xpress.andO;What has happened is that vendors of products supporting Pantone's colorshave &quot;tweaked&quot; their tables of RGB values to get the colors to look right ona given display.andP;  On other displays, though, the colors look entirelydifferent; and no display will be accurate for both Xpress and PageMaker.andO;Radius and Pantone are now working with software vendors to arrive at asolution to this problem.andM;Radius' PrecisionColor Calibrator costs $695.andP;  The Radius color display is$4,295.andP;  That's $4,990 for the package, or $3,670 less than the correspondingitems from Barco.andP;  Whether Barco's unit is sufficiently superior to justifythe price difference remains to be seen.andP;  Neither company has had a chance toevaluate the other's product, and we haven't worked with them ourselves.andP;  Inthe end, we expect different classes of users may make different choicesbased on their particular needs.andP;  Compared with conventional, uncalibratedtechnology, both approaches appear to offer important progress towardstandardized, WYSIWYG color on the screen.andM;Calibrating hard-copy outputandM;Letraset.andP;  The move toward color standardization is occurring in thehard-copy area as well.andP;  At the show, Letraset announced that it had licensedsoftware from Optronics which will help Letraset's new DesignStudio (pagedesign software) and ColorStudio (color retouching software) deliver colorseparations that produce printed color which closely matches the screen.andM;The Optronics software handles the details of the color-separation process,including conversion from the RGB values used on the display to CMYK values;the compression of the color gamut (since the display can generate adifferent range of colors than the printing process); UCR and GCR (for bettertrapping, cleaner colors, and reduced ink usage); and dot-gain compensation.andO;The Optronics software relates the colors it works with to the CIELUV colorspace, which means it can be integrated with devices and other software thatuse CIELUV or other CIE-based standards.andM;The process will involve calibration of both the screen and the output deviceto the printing process.andP;  Optronics will provide control images to help withthis calibration.andP;  If the calibration procedures are carefully applied, &quot;thematched screen colors and printed colors are perceived as identical&quot;according to Letraset.andP;  The software was not demonstrated at the show.andM;Tektronix.andP;  Tektronix showed its color-selection interface, based on theTekHVC color space it is pushing as a standard (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  1, page29).andP;  The interface will run on four different monitors so far, and Tektronixhas an inkjet printer that is calibrated to the same color space.andP;  But thiswork has all been done by Tektronix.andP;  The fate of TekHVC as a standard willprobably depend on support from other major players, and unfortunately nonehave signed up so far.andM;Readers who are interested in calibration of color-separation output producedvia PostScript will want to read the article in last month's Latest Word oncalibration software from Technical Publishing Services.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
