The strike began after negotiators for about 500 news writers, producers, editors and other employees represented by the Writers Guild of America failed to reach agreement on a new contract over the weekend. Union officials said that new talks hadn't been scheduled and that workers were picketing network offices.    Spokesmen for each network said managers had taken over the writing and other positions affected by the strike. They said technical workers represented by other unions weren't honoring guild picket lines, but spokesmen for the other unions couldn't be reached for comment.    Union officials charge that the two networks are taking a particularly hard line in the talks as part of their efforts to cut costs at their news divisions. Among other proposals, the companies want to eliminate arbitration as recourse for dismissal and to hire more temporary employees.    &quot;Company proposals,&quot; a CBS spokesman acknowledged, &quot;are addressed to the basic and necessary issue of reducing operating costs and achieving a greater degree of operating flexibility in our local and network news operations.&quot; A Capital Cities/ABC spokesman declined to comment on the network's proposals.    The joint contract negotiations cover guild employees at ABC and CBS radio and television network operations in New York and Washington, D.C., as well as WABC-TV, WCBS-TV and WCBS radio, New York; WBBM-TV and WBBM radio, Chicago; and KCBS-TV and KNX radio, Los Angeles.    Separately, similar negotiations are scheduled to begin this week between National Broadcasting Co., a General Electric Co. unit, and about 2,800 news employees and technicians represented by the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. </TEXT></DOC>
