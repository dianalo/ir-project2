Steve Cowpersaid at a news conference in Juneau.   The 987-foot vessel was stopped briefly for a scheduled look atits hull, and video cameras were used to ensure that the puncturedhull was sound before the damaged ship was towed into the oftenstormy Gulf of Alaska en route to a San Diego drydock and more than$25 million in repairs.   The 2,500-mile trip is expected to take about 20 days.   The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24, dumping almost 11million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into the waters ofPrince William Sound. After the accident, authorities pumped theremaining oil from the ship into other tankers.   The spill killed thousands of birds and sea mammals and spoiledhundreds of miles of coastline. It also dealt a severe blow toAlaska's $2 billion fishing industry, forcing officials to ban,postpone or restrict fishing.   The vessel unceremoniously lifted anchor Friday and came undertow behind two 7,000-horsepower ocean-going tugboats.   A third tug was attached to the tanker's stern. A salvage boattrailed not far behind.   Two escort vessels loaded with 9,000 feet of containment boom andeach carrying an oil skimming vessel with 4,000 barrels' capacitybrought up the rear.   Al Kapp, skipper of the Journeyman out of California, posted ahand-lettered sign on the side of his boat as he ushered the ExxonValdez away. ``Thanks a lot Exxon,'' the sign said.   Speaking by radio to a nearby media vessel, Kapp said fishingclosures have hurt: ``It's disrupted my life; it's disrupted ourindustry.''   Progress initially was slow, and the tanker moved only about twomiles in the first two hours, said Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard.   The speed is expected to increase to about 5 mph.   Coast Guard spokeswoman Brenda Toledo said a light film of oilwas reported on the water near the tanker as it got under way. Thesource of the sheen was unclear, she said, adding not much oil isnecessary to make a sheen. ``We're talking pints, not gallons,'' shesaid.   Seven Exxon officers and four salvage experts were aboard for thetrip to San Diego, officials said.   The skeleton crew will monitor air pressure in the vessel's cargotanks, conduct inspections and be ready to help with the ship'sengines should the vessel run into trouble.   Exxon and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. have been criticizedfor their slow handling of the spill during its first few days.   Today, oil with a sludge-like consistency can be found 700 milesfrom the reef.   The tanker's former captain, Joseph Hazelwood, has pleadedinnocent to three felony counts of criminal mischief andmisdemeanors, including negligent discharge of pollutants andoperating a vessel while drunk. He is free on $50,000 bail.</TEXT></DOC>
