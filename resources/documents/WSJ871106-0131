Vulnerable West Germany, in particular, faces a whole set of questions about its military, political and psychological defenses. To these John Ardagh's review of contemporary German society, &quot;Germany and the Germans&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 478 pages, $24.95) offers a wordy and partial answer.    Mr. Ardagh's volume is a cheery plow across the sassy and confused nation that for the past 40 years has served as the first-line fortress against the advance of the Warsaw Pact. The author, a Briton, brings an impressive background to a subject that's new to him: He's already produced three works on France and one on European cities. Unfortunately, the freshness of the topic seems to have daunted rather than inspired.    &quot;Germany and the Germans&quot; does give a feel for the odd cultural desert the land of Beethoven and Thomas Mann has become since the war. The &quot;Group of 47,&quot; a clique of young ex-POWs led by Guenther Grass and Heinrich Boell, got things off to a distinguished start with works about the wartime such as &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; and &quot;Billiards at Half-Past Nine.&quot; Since then however, few writers have matched that pair of dour giants, heavy subsidies to the arts notwithstanding. German presses spill out books -- some 60,000 a year, far more than Britain or France -- but the nation's dominant and overly politicized universities seem to have petrified writerly forces in the land of poets and thinkers. One notable exception, the poet and philosopher Hans Magnus Enzensberger, explained the problem this way: &quot;If you invest a billion dollars in the car industry, you probably get some interesting new models; but that doesn't hold good for artistic creation.&quot;    When it comes to explaining the cartelized world of West German business and finance, Mr. Ardagh also offers some insights. Here he spots a contradiction that's among the most revealing of the German national character. Germans' nature-loving side means they're alarmed that their (truly beautiful) Central European forests are dying. But the fondness of the super-tanned Germans for gunning down the autobahn means it would be impossible to put through the kind of reduction of the speed limit the U.S. has seen and that might save the yellowing trees.    The author has some interesting points to make about those more pasty-faced Germans -- from Leipzig, Dresden or East Berlin. He provides a number of jokes about the grim life there. One of the more poignant ones is about the differences between Erich Honecker's politically stifled East Germany and the more free-spoken, but hungrier, Poland of Gen. Jaruzelski. An East German dog meets a Polish dog at the border and asks him why he's going to East Germany. The reply: &quot;Well, I simply must eat.&quot; The Polish dog wants to know why the East German dog is off to Poland. Answer: &quot;I simply must bark.&quot;    When it comes to the big questions that must be asked about Germany, though, Mr. Ardagh sidesteps. Why, for example, are the polls now reporting that fewer West Germans trust President Reagan than trust Mikhail Gorbachev? Why is Chancellor Helmut Kohl losing power to his more dovish coalition partner, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher?    On the other &quot;Germany question,&quot; that of national socialism, Mr. Ardagh is similarly evasive. He duly notes the universal praise that went to President Richard von Weizsacker's Santayanish speech -- &quot;lest we forget&quot; -- in 1985. But he doesn't really explain Bitburg, except to note that it provoked &quot;the wrath of America's Jews.&quot; Nor does he drop any clues that would help us understand why Rudolf Hess's recent suicide has sparked a mini Nazi revival.    Part of Mr. Ardagh's problem may be that he relied heavily on consultant Katharina Schmitz, who is credited on the book's title page. Although this cooperation turned out well on the romantic level -- he married her -- it gives the reader the feeling he's along with Mr. Ardagh on a one-guide tour. A tendency to sloppiness reflected in the misspelling of some important names -- including those of Social Democratic Party father Willy Brandt and Hamburg Mayor Klaus von Dohnanyi -- further hurts the work.    Such weaknesses mean that though &quot;Germany and the Germans&quot; is informative, it doesn't stand up to some of its predecessors. For sheer depth, Gordon Craig's 1982 &quot;The Germans&quot; remains the best. On East Germany, Timothy Garton Ash's &quot;East Germany Today,&quot; while narrower, can be recommended.    To be fair, it must be noted that &quot;Germany and the Germans&quot; contains no major wrong calls. When Mr. Ardagh does venture an opinion, it's on the mark. His reaction, for example, to a hostile classroom encounter between World War II veterans and younger Germans: &quot;So here was a horrifying phony debate: one generation that had failed to stop fascist Germany from aggressing, at odds with another that would refuse to defend a democratic Germany if aggressed. I was aghast.&quot;    ---   Miss Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
