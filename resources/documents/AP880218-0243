Ruder, who arrived here thisweek at the invitation of Japanese officials for talks on improvingcooperation to guard against insider trading and cope with marketvolatility.   ``I have had a great sense of a desire for cooperation betweenthe American and the Japanese stock markets, futures markets andregulators,'' he said.   The SEC, which regulates the U.S. securities industry, andJapan's Finance Ministry issued a joint statement Wednesday sayingboth sides had agreed to strengthen measures against insidertrading and improve communication between exchanges in bothcountries.   The statement came a day after the Finance Ministry recommendedin a report stronger measures against insider trading on par withthose in the United States. The report said Japan's Securities andExchange Law should be tightened to specifically prohibit insidertrading and recommended that criminal penalties replace currentcivil penalties for such abuses.   Ruder said the proposal ``seemed to cover the elements ofinsider trading as we know it in the corporate environment in theUnited States.''   Wednesday's joint statement vowed to encourage discussionsbetween self-regulatory organizations in both countries to detectfraudulent activity and develop ``procedures for the exchange offinancial, surveillance and investigatory information among thoseorganizations.''   Restrictions on insider trading, Ruder said, must be approachedcarefully because of a conflict between preventing inside corporateinformation from leaking to the public and a desire to encouragepublic disclosure of certain information.   The infrequency of corporate takeovers in Japan helps preventlarge-scale insider trading, he said. Knowledge of a plannedtakeover before its public disclosure is a key reason for insidertrading, as it creates an opportunity to buy stocks of a targetcompany and often sell them at a higher price later.   But financial sources have said information is often leaked toinvestors in the Japanese market.   Japan's big four securities firms _ Nomura, Nikko, Daiwa andYamaichi _ can handle as much as 80 percent of daily stock tradingvolume, creating an environment for market manipulation, financialsources say.   Until October's worldwide stock market crash led the Tokyo StockExchange to impose rules on reporting transactions, Japaneseexecutives were not required to report transfers of theirshareholdings.   The SEC and Finance Ministry recognized a growing``interlinkage'' between markets in both countries and agreed thatplanned expansion of futures trading in Japan will intensify theirinterdependence, Ruder said.   He also said communication between the U.S. and Japanese marketswould be improved after the U.S. Commodities Futures TradingCommission is put in direct contact with the Finance Ministry'sSecurities Bureau.   In talks this week, the ministry and the SEC agreed to createsafeguards to counter ``market emergencies,'' their joint statementsaid.   ``Market volatility, as experienced in October 1987, becomeseven more a global concern,'' Ruder said, and praised the cautionexercised by Japanese institutional investors in times of crisis.   Stock prices in New York fell about 23 percent on Black Monday,but the Nikkei Stock Average, the Tokyo market's key indicator,followed with a fall of less than 15 percent partly becauseJapanese institutional investors were reluctant to flee the market,Ruder said.   ``I think I will go back to give the message to institutionalinvestors that they should be more cautious in their reactions,like Japanese investors,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
