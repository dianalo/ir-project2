The latest halt to deliveries _ the second in nine months _ willlast from September through December, said Lt. Col. John Reitz, anArmy spokesman. By January, the Army expects Beretta to resumeproduction and deliveries of the 9mm pistol after makingmodifications to the slide mechanism.   The delay in deliveries was worked out during a meeting Aug. 17between Army and Beretta officials, with the company accepting themove ``at no cost to the government,'' the spokesman said.   The Army insisted on changes to the weapon's manufacture afteran incident in July in which a pistol slide cracked unexpectedlyduring training firings and sent fragments back toward theshooter's chest. It was the fourth such cracking incident over thepast year.   Beretta and the Army have now agreed the metal pistol slides forthe gun will have to be forged using an improved heat process toensure their strength and the guns fitted with a device to captureany slide that does crack.   ``It was agreed that August production quantities would beaccepted without the modified slide and components, pending formalapproval of the engineering change proposal,'' said Reitz.``Deliveries with the new slide mechanism will resume in January1989.''   The spokesman said Beretta also had agreed to retrofit thepistols already delivered with the new mechanisms after completingits production run.   The company has so far delivered more than 140,000 pistols of anorder for 316,000.   The Army first stopped accepting deliveries of the handgun lastNovember because of an unexpected cracking problem with thepistol's frame. Beretta USA, a subsidiary of the Italian arms makerArmi Beretta SpA, subsequently devised a manufacturing solution tothat problem earlier this year and resumed production.   In the meantime, though, the Army had started investigating whyslide bolts on the Berettas were cracking. The first such incidentoccurred late last year.   The latest decision to halt deliveries was reported Monday bythe trade publication ``Defense Week'' and subsequently confirmedby Army officials.   The Washington office of Beretta declined immediate comment onthe matter.   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,Md., beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45-caliberpistol. The Army, which has designated the pistol the M-9, isserving as the executive buying agent for all the services andawarded Beretta an initial contract worth $75 million.   The latest problems arise at a time when Beretta has entered acongressionally ordered competition with the Massachusetts gunmakerSmith andamp; Wesson and several other interested American gunmakers tosupply the next batch of 9mm pistols.   The American firms had protested the 1985 award to a foreigncompany.   The slide bolt on the Beretta is thrown backward after a shot isfired as part of the process of chambering a new round. Armyofficials disclosed last May that Beretta had blamed the slidefailures on the use of special ammunition, but that the Army wasnot prepared to accept that explanation.</TEXT></DOC>
