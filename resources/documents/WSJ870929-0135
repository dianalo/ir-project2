Since Chicago didn't exist until 1830, it seems a bit cheeky of the Chicago Historical Society to offer the answer. That institution has, however, come up with a new permanent exhibit, &quot;We The People: Creating a New Nation 1765-1820,&quot; which takes on the question from an intriguing angle.    Built around five documents (a rare broadside of the Declaration of Independence, the first newspaper printing of the U.S. Constitution, the first official printings of the Bill of Rights, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Treaty of Greenville), the exhibit tells poignant and powerful stories of ordinary people who witnessed an extraordinary time in the nation's life. More than half the items are &quot;flat&quot; (in museum terms, paper as opposed to &quot;dimensional&quot; objects such as fans, fifes and handcuffs) -- posters, cartoons, books, diaries, letters, charts: things that need more than a quick glance to be appreciated.    The Declaration of Independence is displayed alongside the reminiscences of a washerwoman who saw the British surrender at Yorktown, and Elizabeth Ferguson's petition to the government of Pennsylvania for the return of land confiscated when her husband sided with the British. Irony runs high: Visitors approach the elegantly displayed copy of the Constitution by way of the 1798 cartoon &quot;Congressional Pugilists,&quot; which depicts Matthew Lyon's spitting, tongs-wielding brawl in the House of Representatives. And the Bill of Rights is around the corner from a poster advertising a $30 reward for the return of Arch, a slave of yellow complexion, who &quot;talks sensibly and artful.&quot;    The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Treaty of Greenville added vast chunks of land to the U.S. Although the Treaty of Greenville obtained for the nation the land at the mouth of the Chicago River, there was no town started there until 1830. &quot;We The People&quot; includes no mention of the founding of Chicago; rather it is a story of the ideals (and a good bit of the wheeling and dealing, not to mention chicanery) that set the stage for the mass migration westward and the development of Midwest urban industrial and commercial centers.    Dimensional objects punctuate and accent the flat items: a flute played at Yorktown; a china tea set carried from New York by a family moving into the wilds of pioneer Illinois; the keepsake box of Lucy Calmes Wight, whose family migrated from France to Virginia to Kentucky to Illinois; a plow that figures in the history of Chicago; and a set of wonderfully carved powder horns.    Powder horns were hardly rare among Revolutionary soldiers. Made from cow or ox horns, these hollow flasks kept the soldier's powder dry. A horn also gave a bored and homesick soldier something to carve on during long days of idleness. The Chicago Historical Society owns a dozen; the curators culled four of the most graphic for this exhibit and put them in a mirrored cabinet so the carvings can be seen from two sides.    Danforth Armour's wooden plow hangs alongside the Treaty of Greenville. It is a fitting symbol of the farming culture that engulfed the Indian culture in the Midwest. Mr. Armour was a third-generation American who lived from 1799 to 1873. As a young man he moved from his family farm in Connecticut to New York (where he farmed on land that had belonged to the Oneida Indians). For 40 years he used his grandfather's plow to work the land. As an old man, he brought his plow when he moved to northern Illinois. Some of his family stayed in New York and some of them moved to the Midwest and plowed a different kind of field, one that produced hot dogs and big money.    This exhibition of artifacts, both flat and dimensional, is oddly moving. &quot;The most riveting WE depends on who you are,&quot; says Terry Fife, a curator. &quot;If all the different kinds of people who walked through here could see something of themselves, we would feel that the exhibition had accomplished what we set out to do.&quot;    I thought about this as I watched different kinds of We The Peoples view the exhibit. Some of them may not have reacted according to stereotype. I, a white woman conditioned by historical facts and hardened by television depictions of slavery, stood for an inordinate length of time rereading the faded poster advertising for the return of Arch. Chicagoans smile and go back to look again at the story of Matthew Lyon, the wild Irishman who immigrated first to Vermont and later to frontier Kentucky, who changed political parties in midcareer, who spat upon and took fireplace tongs to his congressional opponent, and who was once reelected from jail. And the little black girl walking just in front of me observed the slave handcuffs with hardly a glance but was absorbed by Amos Doolittle's colored engravings of the action at Lexington and Concord. &quot;What would have happened,&quot; she asked her mother, &quot;if those men in the red coats had won?&quot;    We The People were -- and are -- a diverse bunch.    ---   Ms. King is a free-lance writer based in Henderson, Ky. </TEXT></DOC>
