The company, 25% owned by the Ontario government, said its boardof directors approved the sale as part of a strategy to restructure theproperty portfolio of its resources group. As a result of the proposedsale, the company estimated it will incur an after-tax writedown of $30million in the second quarter because the value of the properties isless than their book value. The properties being sold represent about20% of Suncor's proved oil reserves and 11% of its proved natural gasreserves. At the end of 1987, Toronto-based Suncor had net proved reservesof 43.6 million barrels of oil and 36.1 billion cubic feet of naturalgas. Based on the appropriate 8.7 million barrels of oil and 40 billioncubic feet of natural gas reserves that Suncor has put on the block,an estimate of the sale could be between $80 million and $100 million.</TEXT></DOC>
