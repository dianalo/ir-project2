The youthful Chinese artists, known as ``The Stars,'' shot toprominence in 1979 when they marched through Beijing to protestpolice interference in a show they had set up without officialapproval.   The authorities gave in and allowed the artists to stage theexhibition, unprecedented in Communist China, that featuredonce-forbidden topics such as nudes, abstracts and works ofaesthetic rather than political content.   After another show in 1980, however, the 30-member groupdisbanded. While some remained active in Beijing, others scatteredaround the globe, settling in Europe, Japan and the United States.   Six of the artists were recently in Hong Kong for a retrospectivefeaturing the work of 12 group members. The exhibition openedearlier this month in the basement gallery of a posh residentialneighborhood and is scheduled to run for five weeks before moving toTaipei, Taiwan and Paris.   Sculptor Wang Keping said The Stars were significant by showingthat artistic activity in China need not be organized or approved bythe ruling party. ``Earlier art was all the same,'' he said.   Individuality was the driving force behind the group, agreesChang Tsong-zung, the owner of Hanart Gallery who organized theretrospective. ``The only common aim of the artists when they firststarted was that they wanted to be different from each other.''   Bo Yun, a teacher at the Academy of Arts and Design in Beijingwhose abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective, saidartistic freedom in China has advanced since the group's landmark1979 exhibition but limitations remain.   There is no problem, he said, ``if you use a work of art tosatirize an opponent of the government. But if you mock thegovernment, I'm afraid that will pose a problem.''   Members of The Stars also say Beijing no longer allows them toexhibit as a group, thwarting two attempts in 1983 and 1986. Thereason, believes Bo, is that the group's name has become a symbol ofthe democracy movement.   The retrospective includes works that date from the group'sheyday, including Wang's Buddha-like bust of Chairman Mao Tse-tungsignifying the deification of the Communist leader during theultraleftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. It is called ``The Idol.''   Other pieces adopt obviously current themes, including themixed-media work ``Safe Sex'' by Ai Weiwei that features aprophylactic attached to a rain coat. Prices run from hundreds tothousands of dollars.   The works are as different as the paths the artists have takensince they disbanded after their Beijing exhibitions.   Wang, 39, a soft-spoken man with a wisp of a goatee who joinedthe fanatical Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, moved toParis in 1984, convinced he could not develop further in Chinalargely because of political pressure. ``Art freedom is onlypossible in a democratic country with human rights,'' he said.   The sculptor lives and works out of a workshop he rents from theFrench government and has been featured at the Museum ofContemporary Art in Paris and the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seoul,South Korea.   Wang recently wrote a political play titled, ``The Retrial of WeiJingsheng,'' a contemporary of The Stars who led a fledglingpro-democracy movement in China before being jailed for 15 years in1979. Wang said the play will be performed in Paris this March.   Bo, 40, has remained in Beijing although he is considering a moveoverseas. He supplements his 150 yuan ($40) a month salary byselling his paintings to foreigners in China and at overseasexhibits. He owns a tiny Fiat, a sign of financial well-being in acountry where private cars remain rare.   Other Stars on display in the retrospective include Huang Rui andMa Desheng, the two leaders of the group, and Li Shuang, who wasarrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor re-educationfor ``incitement to debauchery.'' When she was arrested, she wasliving with a French diplomat but had not yet married him.   The exhibition includes caligraphy by Zhong Ahcheng, also knownas Ah Cheng, whose fictional work ``The King of Children'' wastranslated to film and premiered at the Cannes Film Festival lastyear.   Although The Stars have spread throughout the world they havestayed in touch with one another. From the heady days of 1979-80 wasforged ``a feeling of brotherhood'' that has not diminished, Bo said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, Jan. 27</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
