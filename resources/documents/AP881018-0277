Gold prices fell in New York. In late trading, Republic NationalBank of New York said gold was bid at $410.70 a troy ounce, downfrom $411.90 a troy ounce late Monday.   The U.S. currency began the day on the upswing in Asia, buoyedby comments in Tokyo from Bank of France governor Jacques deLarosiere who reiterated support for central bank intervention toachieve exchange rate stability. The dollar then headed lower inEurope before turning up again in domestic trading.   Analysts said that despite the appearance of volatility, thedollar was stuck in the same narrow range it has been trading insince spring, between 1.80 and 1.90 West German marks.   ``All we're seeing is the low end of the same range,'' saidJames Pugh, of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. ``It will continue to do thatuntil the election.''   Those following the dollar generally agreed that any drasticmoves up or down were unlikely before the presidential election isdecided next month. Smaller moves within the established tradingrange are possible, they said.   Indeed, some technical analysts attributed the move upward atthe end of day Tuesday to a bounce off the low end of the tradingrange.
