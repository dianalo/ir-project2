The extent of ductilityloss due to hydrogen increases as the stress state tends from uniaxialto equibiaxial tension. Hydrogen embrittlement is characterized by intergranularfracture with failure due to microcrack formation, microcrack link-up,and macrocrack growth. The increased susceptibility to intergranularembrittlement with increasing biaxiality is a consequence of an enhancedrate of the link-up of strain-induced intergranular microcracks.</TEXT></DOC>
