Investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee also said the SEC's inquiry is far broader than previously indicated, covering stock and option trading in about 100 U.S. corporate takeovers and other situations in the early 1980s.    An aide to another committee, who asked not to be identified, confirmed the subcommittee staff members' account.    The SEC in 1984 stated in court filings that its investigation covered trading in advance of the announcement of more than 40 deals. At that time, an SEC staff attorney called the Ellis case the largest-insider trading investigation in SEC history. Others close to the investigation said then that they believed the profits in question totaled more than $40 million, which would make the matter one of the biggest insider-trading cases ever.    One reason the SEC appears to be making progress is that it has started receiving more solid information about trading by Ellis accounts. A Swiss magistrate is reviewing certain trading records turned over by Ellis after the Swiss Supreme Court rejected the firm's appeal against doing so, subcommittee investigators said. They said the magistrate is being aided by an experienced securities investigator, who works for the magistrate but is being paid for by the SEC.    Several members of the SEC's enforcement division declined to comment on the Ellis case. In Zurich, George Dreyfuss, one of the co-owners of Ellis, referred all questions to the other co-owner, Claude Dreifuss, who denied that Ellis had ever been involved in insider trading.    Mr. Dreifuss also said he believes the case is closed. &quot;I can't imagine five years later that they would have a case,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;For us, the case is over.&quot;    Congressional sources offer a different assessment. &quot;There's a good chance this will break within the next year,&quot; said a staff member of the oversight and investigations subcommittee, which is headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and oversees, among other things, the SEC's administration and enforcement of securities laws. The subcommittee also is conducting an Ellis inquiry that isn't related to its current investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., for which it plans to hold hearings this week.    But, like that Drexel investigation, the Ellis inquiry is aimed at raising questions about the way Wall Street works. Subcommittee investigators said they plan to hold hearings in June, asking why so many Wall Street firms failed to detect or question dozens of suspicious transactions by Ellis and by Dennis Levine, the former Drexel managing director who was charged with insider trading in May 1986 and pleaded guilty a month later to securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.    Congressional investigators are especially interested in the handful of stocks in which both Mr. Levine and Ellis accounts traded before announcement of a takeover. They already have subpoenaed documents from one Wall Street firm, which they declined to identify.    Big but elusive, the Ellis case is the Loch Ness monster of insider trading, said one lawyer long familiar with it. &quot;It keeps getting sighted, but it's never there,&quot; he said.    Indeed, more than once in recent years, sources predicted indictments within weeks or months. But as months and then years passed, it looked as though the SEC had been stymied as it followed the trading trail overseas.    Now, an oversight and investigations staff member said, the SEC has &quot;penetrated the veil.&quot; Indeed, aside from what the SEC now knows, the staff members said they have obtained the names of some of the beneficiaries of some Ellis accounts suspected of engaging in insider trading. They declined to disclose any of those names.    The investigators said they asked the New York Stock Exchange to review its records of trading by Mr. Levine in dozens of Big Board stocks, and to look for foreign entities that traded alongside Mr. Levine in stocks before the announcement of takeover bids. The Big Board found 19 stocks in which such trading occurred, they said.    Accounts linked to Ellis traded in eight of those 19, they said. These are the eight stocks they named: Dart Industries Inc., Hanna Mining Co., Criton Corp., Maryland Cup Corp., RCA Corp., Jewel Cos., Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. and Faberge Inc.    The New York Stock Exchange declined to comment on its referrals. </TEXT></DOC>
