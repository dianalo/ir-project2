(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bob Dole dueled George Bush for Republicanadvantage Tuesday in New Hampshire's kickoff presidential primary,while Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis bid for a decisive victoryin the Democratic struggle for supremacy and survival.   The first returns, as always, came from tiny Dixville Notch,which gave 11 votes of hope to Vice President Bush and 6 to Dole.Seven Notchers went Democrat, split 4-to-3 between second-placecontenders Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon.   Pre-election polls said the GOP race was a tossup, with KansasSen. Dole propelled by victory in last week's Iowa caucuses andBush struggling to rebound from a disappointing third-place finishthere.   Rep. Jack Kemp and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, theircandidacies at stake, bid for third place against Pat Robertson inthe first test for the former television evangelist in a primaryelection.   To a man they said New Hampshire voters would deliver a surprise.   ``It's going to be an interesting contest,'' Robertson saidduring a chance election-morning encounter with Simon. ``I metthree of 'em that voted for me early so I hope that holds.''   Dukakis' rivals conceded him a victory in advance. They vied forsecond place and hoped to deny the Massachusetts governor a hugevictory that would give him a boost for the delegate-rich contestsahead.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., Jesse Jackson, one-time front-runner GaryHart and Bruce Babbitt were back in the pack in the New Hampshiresurveys, with Babbitt and Hart hoping to avoid a drubbing thatwould doom their campaigns.   Gephardt and Simon, who finished one-two in Iowa and just aheadof Dukakis, engaged one another in an angry fight over some SimonTV ads critical of Gephardt's voting record.   ``We're gonna run very well,'' Simon said Tuesday morning as heaimed to upend the Missouri congressman and further scramble thewide-open Democratic race.   Dukakis cautioned, ``Anything can happen. New Hampshire votersare very independent,'' but he was confident enough to talk abouthis plans for March 8 when 20 states, including 14 Southern orborder states, will hold Super Tuesday primaries or caucuses.   ``We're going to contest every one of those states,'' Dukakissaid. ``I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.''   In terms of delegates, New Hampshire was small stakes indeed.Democrats were allotting 18 of their 22 delegates to the nationalconvention next summer, with 23 spots at stake on the Republicanside.   But it wasn't delegates that drew the candidates and theirtelevision advertising dollars to a sparsely settled state with areputation for upsetting front-runners and elevating upstarts. Itwas the prospect of momentum and the ability to attract campaignfunds needed next month.   Then again, as New Hampshire boosters never tire of pointingout, no one has ever won the White House without a victory in thefirst-in-the-nation primary since the Granite State started goingfirst in 1952.   There was every reason to believe that for some, the firstprimary would also be the last.   Babbitt conceded that New Hampshire voters had power of life anddeath over his quest. Others were less direct, though Kemp and duPont were locked in a struggle with each other and Robertson toemerge as a conservative alternative to the front-runners.   Dukakis, the favorite son, had a different concern. His aidespointed out that the largest margin in history for a contest ofthis sort was 11 percentage points.   And they worried aloud about winners in past Democraticprimaries in New Hampshire being viewed as losers because they didworse that expected _ Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and Edmund Muskie fouryears later.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
