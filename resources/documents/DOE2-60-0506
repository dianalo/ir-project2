To address this, the methodology usedin the conventional rate theory is first generalized to include the effectsof anisotropic diffusion. Reaction constants and sink strengths for spherical,cylindrical and planar sinks are derived using methods of reaction kineticscontrolled by anisotropic diffusion. It is shown that in a non-cubicmaterial the diffusional anisotropy difference (DAD) between the vacanciesand the interstitials can give rise to a very significant bias. Thisbias is a zero-order effect and can completely overwhelm the conventionalbias caused by the first-order point-defect/sink elastic interactiondifference. Thus, contrary to the implications of the conventional ratetheory, edge dislocations in non-cubic materials are not necessarilybiased towards interstitials. Similarly, grain boundaries and surfacesare no longer neutral sinks. The resulting theory is applied to explainsome 'anomalous' behaviour of zirconium under irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
