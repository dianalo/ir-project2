Military officials said Lt. Col. Francisco Baula died at amilitary hospital about nine hours after guards at the suburbanCamp Crame stockade shot him when he refused to halt and ignoredwarning shots.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the PhilippineConstabulary, said Baula was shot and wounded three times.   Officials at the Armed Forces of the Philippines Medical Centersaid earlier that Baula underwent surgery and was expected torecover. The stockade commandant later said the renegade officersuccumbed to his wounds.   ``I was informed that at 9:10 this morning he died of hiswounds,'' Col. Percival Adiong said in a telephone interview. ``Wewere hoping that he would survive.''   Baula was arrested Oct. 3 along with two other military mensought in connection with the Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt againstPresident Corazon Aquino's government.   The uprising was led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan. Baula was operations officer of the air force's 420thSupply Wing and directed the takeover of the Villamor air base inManila.   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded in therevolt _ the most serious of about six armed attemps to oust Mrs.Aquino since she took office Feb. 25, 1986.   Baula fled after the coup attempt and remained at large until hewas arrested with the two other suspects while having lunch at arestaurant in suburban Pasay City this month.   Montano said Baula slipped into a ``dark corner'' of thestockade shortly after midnight and tried to climb over the wallwith a makeshift ladder.   Guards saw him, ordered him to halt and fired warning shots,Montano said. They then fired at the colonel and he fell to theground, according to Montano.   ``Our investigation shows that there were no others who tried tohelp him,'' Montano said.   He added that security would be reinforced at the stockade,located at the headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary.   Last June mutineers attacked the Camp Crame stockade in aneffort to free former Gov. Orlando Dulay, jailed in connection withthe killings of several volunteers who had worked for Mrs. Aquinoduring her 1986 election campaign against President FerdinandMarcos.   The raiders failed to free Dulay but fled with a large number ofweapons.   Mrs. Aquino became president after Marcos was ousted by acivilian-military uprising in February 1986.   At the time of Baula's arrest, the military reported policefound $5,000 in his car and said the money was to be used tofinance a new coup attempt.   Arrested with Baula were Constabulary Capt. Roque Maranon andtrainee Inocencio Cuyuca.   They are among nearly 80 military rebels and right-wingmilitants reported to have been arrested in recent weeks. Manilanewspapers, citing unidentified intelligence sources, have saidthere is a new conspiracy agains the government.   Still being sought is Honasan. He was jailed last December butescaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay the following April.</TEXT></DOC>
