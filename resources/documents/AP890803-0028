Otherswere sticking by their guns as the organization prepared to vote ongun control resolutions.   ``It's a very emotional issue for this group and the delegatesare really polarized,'' Steve Cain, president of the OklahomaFraternal Order of Police, said Wednesday.   Some delegates _ many from Eastern cities _ expressed supportnot only for restrictions but also for waiting periods on gunpurchases. Other delegates, however, backed the National RifleAssociation's blanket opposition to more gun controls. The NRA, anational gun lobby, has more than 3 million members.   One of the resolutions _ which could go to a vote today at theorganization's national convention _ would direct the FOP'snational legislative committee to support ``sensible'' legislationon the sale of semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47, the Uzi andthe AR-15.   Another calls for lobbying efforts against any attempts toliberalize laws on machine guns and silencers.   A third resolution supports the concept of waiting periods ongun sales.   Don Cahill, chairman of the legislative panel, said he wasconfident about the chances of the resolutions being passed by the5,000 attending the convention.   He added that the FOP has been inaccurately portrayed as``anti-gun ownership.''   ``That is not the case,'' Cahill said. ``We're sportsmen andwe're marksmen. But some guns have no legitimate use other than tokill other people, including police officers.   ``All we want to do is to slow down the proliferation of weaponsobtained by the criminals.''   Cahill of the Prince William County, Va., police department saidsome of the strongest opponents of the resolutions are fromsparsely populated Western states ``where you could shoot off acannon and it wouldn't hurt anybody.''   ``But the majority of our cops are not in those locations. Theyare in densely populated areas.''   Deputy Sheriff C.R. Powell of Tucson, Ariz., said he fearspassage of the resolutions ultimately will lead to police officersnot having access to weapons with the firepower that criminals have.   He said the Pima County Sheriff's Department is constantlyfighting drug runners from nearby Mexico who are armed withsemiautomatic weapons.   ``I don't want to be facing the bad guys with just a .45,''Powell said.   Charles J. Oshinsky of Charleston, S.C., a retired police andsecurity officer, said his position is ``no gun controlwhatsoever.'' He backs the NRA position that outlawing weaponsinfringes on the constitutional right to bear arms.   The NRA, though present at the convention, is prohibited fromlobbying at its booth in a building across from the State FairArena, site of the convention's main business.   Jody Thomas of the NRA said the association was notified inwriting to refrain from political activity at the booth. She saidthe NRA has been advancing its cause at a hospitality suite nearthe convention.   Inside the hall, numerous FOP members espoused the NRA view.Among them: Sam Cross, a retired police chief from Indio, Calif.,who said he found gun controls such as waiting periods ineffective.   ``We've had waiting periods for at least 20 years in California,but the crime rate has kept going up,'' he said.   Still, Cain, a lieutenant with the Norman Police Department,said something must be done.   ``I head a narcotics unit,'' said Cain, ``and I'm tired ofseeing our officers outgunned.''</TEXT></DOC>
