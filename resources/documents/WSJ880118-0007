Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., sources close to Sterling's board said last night.    Sterling's board, which met yesterday, also is expected to direct its financial adviser, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., to explore alternatives to Hoffmann-La Roche's bid, the sources said. The individuals didn't elaborate on what measures might be considered.    Sterling's actions, which were expected, are to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing to be filed by tomorrow.    The Hoffmann-La Roche/Sterling Drug contest is being closely watched on Wall Street both because of its participants and because the outcome could influence other foreign suitors now looking at U.S. concerns.    If Hoffmann-La Roche succeeds in acquiring Sterling, many takeover professionals reason, other foreign concerns would be encouraged to pursue similar endeavors. If the Swiss concern loses, the widely predicted tide of foreign takeovers could be slowed, with a corresponding drop in profits for Wall Street's takeover community.    In another respect, the Hoffmann offer is seen as a test of fire for the investment banking departments of major commercial banks, which in recent months have realized some hard-fought successes after years of trying to elbow their way into the takeover business.    Hoffmann-La Roche's choice of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. as adviser raised eyebrows on Wall Street, all the more because the Swiss company had an historical relationship with the powerful firm of First Boston Corp. Officials at some of Wall Street's largest investment banks, no lovers of their low-cost commercial banking competitors, are rooting privately for Sterling's advisers -- investment banking firm Morgan Stanley and law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher andamp; Flom -- to soundly defeat Morgan Guaranty.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Sterling closed at $74.125 a share, up $2.    Meanwhile, Wall Street's battered arbitragers view a possible bidding war for Sterling as their first major opportunity to recoup some of the mammoth losses of Black Monday. &quot;It's shaping up as a really beautiful deal,&quot; said one arbitrager. &quot;People are saying this could be the savior of the business.&quot;    Sterling's reported rejection of the Hoffmann-La Roche bid is the latest volley is an especially spirited defense devised by a team led by Joseph Fogg of Morgan Stanley and Morris Kramer, a partner with Skadden Arps.    Their strategy has been to jab at Hoffmann-La Roche's perceived weaknesses. Knowing that Swiss concerns are frequently obsessed with secrecy, Skadden Arps filed suit contending that Hoffmann-La Roche has improperly concealed the identities of its controlling shareholders.    The suit also sought financial information sensitive enough to make the Swiss firm wince. Skadden Arps further spiced its suit with allegations of insider trading that prompted an immediate investigation by the SEC. To drive the point home, John Pietruski, Sterling's chairman, soundly criticized Hoffmann-La Roche in Swiss newspapers.    At the same time, Sterling has attacked Morgan Guaranty, betting that the bank might be vulnerable to charges of doubledealing. Sterling's Mr. Pietruski, in a letter to Morgan Guaranty's chairman, attacked the bank's representation of Hoffmann-La Roche as unethical. Morgan Guaranty, as Sterling's transfer agent and longtime banker, had access to such confidential financial information as Sterling's stockholder lists.    Morgan Guaranty has denied it did anything improper.    Hoffmann-La Roche and Morgan Guaranty have vowed to continue their pursuit of Sterling. On Friday, Hoffmann-La Roche repeated its earlier request to meet with Sterling executives to discuss the Swiss firm's offer.    In a letter to Sterling's chairman, Fritz Gerber, Hoffmann-La Roche chairman, said he remains &quot;eager&quot; to begin talks that would &quot;explore with you all of the terms of our proposal in order to present to Sterling and its shareholders the best possible alternative.&quot; At the same time, Mr. Gerber criticized Sterling's suit as &quot;meritless&quot; and &quot;irrelevant.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
