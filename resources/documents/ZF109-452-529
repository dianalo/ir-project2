895 pounds Developer's Edition; 995 poundsLAN Pack; Free upgrade from dBase IV 1.0; 125 pounds upgrade from dBase IIIPlusandM;* PC USER VERDICT Two years ago it would have done the business.andP;  Now it'sless clear whether what is--essentially -- a bug fix is going to be enough toconvince users and make up that lost ground.andM;When Ashton-Tate launched dBase IV 1.0, it didn't need clairvoyance to seethat an improved version 1.1 would be necessary.andP;  Some of the featurespromised in the 1.0 documentation were simply not present in the code, therewere major and obvious bugs, and the memory management and overlay handlingwere so crude that the application generator, for example, spent most of itstime swapping overlays from disk to RAM and back.andP;  Even then, it ended upposting an 'out of memory' message.andM;However, it would have taken true psychic powers to predict a two-year delaybefore the obvious upgrade appeared.andP;  In most packages, upgrades from 1.0 to1.1 are normally bug-fixes and incremental improvements and take a few monthsto complete; in the time Ashton-Tate has taken, a jump to 2.0 or even 3.0would normally be involved.andM;But the dBase IV numbering system isn't perverse.andP;  The new dBase IV 1.1 isnot a major upgrade to the features and functions of 1.0; rather, it ought tobe regarded as the package that 1.0 should have been in 1988.andM;The length of time taken for the change shows that there were deeper flaws inthe original package than most early users and observers realised.andP;  It turnedout that producing version 1.1 wasn't just a matter of tweaking the 1.0 codeinto some semblance of order but was more akin to a rewrite from the groundupwards.andP;  This required the use of structured development techniques and alsothe introduction of detailed testing of every part of the program, both onits own and in combination with the rest.andM;That was clear at the launch of 1.1, when Harry Wong, chief scientist in thedatabase products division, talked about &quot;bottom-up&quot;, &quot;code walk-through&quot;,and &quot;pre-integration&quot; testing.andP;  The first involved testing each layer of codefrom the most fundamental upwards; the second, a detailed structural overviewof the entire package; and the third, the thorough testing of new codemodules before they were integrated into existing code to produce a newpre-release 'baseline' version of 1.1.andM;The implication of this approach is that little of this work was done fordBase IV 1.0, so that once the review process was started the volume of codechanges required to solve structural problems increased exponentially.andM;The other corollary of this new and stricter development environment was thatthere was no time or space for programmers to add features to the originalspecification of dBase IV 1.0.andP;  Rewriting and testing the behaviour ofexisting functions was quite enough work without attempting to introducecompletely new features that would only bring structural changes and probablebugs of their own.andP;  Besides, it could be argued that there was nothing wrongwith the specification of dBase IV anyway.andP;  If 1.0 had worked as advertised,and with reasonable speed, then customers would have been very happy indeedwith the improvements over dBase III Plus.andM;The packaging and documentation of dBase IV 1.1 provide more clues toAshton-Tate's attitude to the upgrade.andP;  The Change manual doesn't cover theimprovements from 1.0 to 1.1, for example, but concentrates on thedifferences between dBase III Plus and dBase IV.andM;The changes from 1.0 to 1.1 are covered in just eight pages of the GettingStarted manual, and the remainder of the upgrade material involves thereplacement of parts of the 1.0 manual set, which has remained the same since1988.andP;  The implication is that the package is still being aimed at dBase IIIPlus users who've been put off dBase IV by the bad reception it received, andhave yet to switch either to dBase IV or to one of its competitors.andM;But it must be remembered that dBase IV 1.1 has the same basic design asdBase IV 1.0, which was specified at least three years ago.andP;  The databasemarket has moved on quite a way since then, particularly in the direction ofclient-server SQL database management, and Ashton-Tate is now inevitablylagging behind.andP;  The SQL Server edition of dBase IV 1.1 -- complete withRational Systems' DOS extender technology and support for various serversincluding Oracle, DB2 and IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition, along with theMicrosoft/Sybase SEQL Server itself -- is still not shipping and has no firmshipment date.andP;  And the marriage between the dBase IV language and SQL isstill an uneasy one, although the interface has been tidied up in the gapbetween 1.0 and 1.1.andP;  For example, when using version 1.0 in the SQL mode,you couldn't mix and match SQL commands with dBase commands that did the samejob.andP;  Instead, SQL commands had to be used throughout.andP;  Similarly, you couldonly use SQL from the dot prompt or in program files, so that the new andfriendly Control Centre menus couldn't be used.andM;The SQL mode in 1.1 fixes both these problems.andP;  Most dBase commands,including those used for file creation, browsing and updating, can now beused to access both dBase and SQL files.andP;  The Control Centre interface cannow create and run SQL applications, create dBase queries in SQL mode, andcreate, modify and print reports and labels -- but it can't be used to createand modify SQL data tables directly.andM;Ashton-Tate believes that SQL users coming to dBase IV will be pleased tohave access to all the dBase screen layout, querying and reporting tools,which compare favourably with the spartan SQL environment.andP;  On the otherhand, dBase users who want SQL may be prepared to put up with a certainamount of re-education to get the extra flexibility.andM;But dBase IV 1.1 really falls between two stools.andP;  It would be simpler toembed SQL commands in dBase programs by bracketing them with some sort ofSQLBEGIN and SQLEND indicators, without restricting the dBase command set.andO;Instead, dBase IV 1.1 provides mix-and-match functionality for SQL and dBasecommands with no means of distinguishing which is which, except for thecontext of the commands and the particular data files being accessed.andO;Perhaps the Server Edition of dBase IV 1.1, now due to ship before the end ofthe year -- and already built into dBase IV 1.1 for VAX/VMX (see Platformschange box, page 37) -- will clear things up.andP;  But intermingling dBase andSQL code while accessing multiple SQL and dBase files on several servers willbring problems for developers.andM;These problems could probably not have been avoided, given that compatibilitywith earlier dBase versions was essential, and that the dBase languageactually grew up alongside SQL and is much more widely used.andP;  It'sunfortunate for Ashton-Tate that SQL is the distributed database language ofchoice, mainly because of its use in those applications in the mainframe andminicomputer worlds.andP;  If the company had introduced its multiple-platformdevelopment strategy much earlier (see Platform change box, page 37), andimproved the dBase language at the same time, then perhaps dBase and SQLwould be slugging it out in the server market today.andM;However, other problems that should have been avoided in dBase IV 1.0 havecertainly been fixed in 1.1.andP;  The original version required 516Kb RAM, forexample, while the new one requires 450Kb; this means that the problems withnetworks on 640Kb PCs have mostly gone away.andM;Extra memory management products like Qualitas' 386Max, Quarterdeck's QEMM,and the All Chargecard gave some relief for machines with an 80286 or 80386and at least 1Mb RAM, but lower-specification machines were always going tobe in trouble.andP;  The 450Kb requirement of 1.1 means that any of the majornetwork standards can be used, and there's much less likelihood of the randommemory collisions that made 1.0 such a lottery.andM;Similarly, the expanded RAM support, promised but not delivered in 1.0, hasnow arrived.andP;  It hasn't arrived directly, but in the shape of HyperWare'sHyperDisk cache software.andP;  This is a fairly conventional disk cache,installed along with the rest of dBase IV 1.1, which uses extended orexpanded RAM to store frequently-accessed disk sectors and so speed up diskoperations.andP;  Unlike other caches, however, HyperDisk is set up only whendBase IV is loaded, and removed when dBase IV quits.andM;This mode of operation can cause some problems.andP;  If TSRs are being run alongwith dBase IV -- as allowed by the smaller memory 'footprint' of 1.1 -- thenthe DBCINIT command must be installed in AUTOEXEC.BAT, or the lineDEVICE=DBCINIT.EXE must be included in CONFIG.SYS before the TSRs are loaded.andO;This reserves 'certain signals' for the cache to use.andP;  The other thing towatch is that the default setting of the cache actually caches disk writes aswell as reads, so that a power failure or system crash could result in databeing lost.andP;  Typing RUN DBCACHE /W at the dot prompt changes things so thatdisk writes are always physically transferred to disk; alternatively theCtrl-Alt-S key combination can be used inside dBase IV to do the same job.andM;The size of the cache is normally determined by the cache software, althoughit's configurable with the DBCACHE /XC option, and a choice of extended orexpanded RAM is offered during installation.andP;  The cache certainly speeds upmany dBase IV 1.1 operations if sufficient extended or expanded RAM isavailable.andP;  For example, browsing through a large file is much faster if biglumps of the file are in cache RAM rather than on disk, and the ratherdangerous cached write feature means that file updates can be performedwithout a disk write operation interrupting things after each record.andM;However, it would have been nice to have a general-purpose cache programbundled with dBase IV 1.1, so that it could be used with all programs, andthose users who received cache software bundled with their systems could usetheir existing packages instead.andP;  That's particularly true in Windows 3.0,since the dBase IV cache won't run with the XMS extended memory set up byWindows.andM;The cache also does nothing for network drives, so Ashton-Tate recommendsthat overlays and other files are copied from the server to the local harddisk for faster performance.andM;Whether it's installed on a network or not, the better memory and overlaymanagement in 1.1, combined with the cache, can certainly make many dBase IVoperations feel faster on the screen.andP;  Of course, the perceived increase inspeed might also be due to the fact that the performance of most office PCshas increased dramatically in the last two years, but Ashton-Tate deserves atleast some of the credit.andM;The rest of the changes in 1.1 are comparatively trivial.andP;  A new andsimplified installation program provides a range of options fromquick-and-dirty file copying to careful manual installation with every optionqueried.andM;The DBSETUP program now provides control over detailed memory usage settings,such as the DBHEAP MS-DOS environment variable that controls how much ofavailable RAM is allocated to data and how much to program overlays.andP;  Thereare fewer restrictions in the use of User Defined Functions (UDFs) and ONcommands, so that a UDF, for example, can now perform extra dBase functionsin an interrupt routine if th DBTRAP variable is set to ON.andP;  Again, improvedmemory management is the reason for this.andM;The dBase IV language itself has changed little.andP;  There are just 10 newcommands and functions, most of them trivial apart from the new ability torun MS-DOS programs from within dBase applications, and there aren't manymore syntax changes or extra options for existing commands.andM;Of the extra options, the most important one for developers is that the Indexcommand can now have a For clause added to it.andP;  This means that an index canbe created only for those records meeting a particular set of criteria.andP;  As aresult, index creation is faster because only a sub-set of records isindexed, and data retrieval is faster because the database manager has asmaller index file to scan.andM;For users who've been coping with the vagaries of 1.0, however, the userinterface changes are barely worth mentioning.andP;  The Organize menu is nowaccessible from the Browse and Edit screens to create indexes, undeleterecords and otherwise manipulate files, for example.andP;  Each file skeleton inthe 'query-by-example' module now has variable-width columns thatautomatically adjust to match the column name and the query criteria enteredinto them.andM;Apart from users, there are many thousands of dBase programmers who've stuckwith the package since the CP/M days, and who've steadily been using dBase IV1.0 and working round the bugs, or sticking with dBase III Plus while waitingfor the bugs to be fixed.andM;Throughout the database business, developers have been curtailing projects oravoiding certain commands if they wanted to get into dBase IV, and livingwith the kludges and constraints that decision caused.andM;Developers were the driving force in dBase IV adoption, particularly with theApplication Generator largely unusable thanks to memory constraints.andP;  Theywanted some of the extra features in the language, and were mostly preparedto spend time dodging bugs that shouldn't have been there in the first place.andO;The benefits of end-user application development have never really been seenin dBase IV, and the applications shipped for it have the air of temporarysolutions.andM;So what do those developers do now?andP;  With a supposedly bug-free dBase IV 1.1available, they ought to go back to the applications they developed in 1.0and revamp them using the commands and routines that were too dodgy before.andO;But with the development backlog always a problem, what's more likely is thatexisting 1.0 applications, with all their kludges and work-arounds, willcontinue to be used with 1.1.andP;  Then, treading carefully, developers will tryagain to use the features of 1.0 that have been sanitised for theirprotection in 1.1.andM;It's on the loyalty of its developers that dBase IV 1.1's success -- and thepossible survival of Ashton-Tate itself -- really depends.andP;  That loyalty hasso far been unquestioned, largely because the pool of experienced dBaseprogrammers has no wish to retrain at this late stage in any competingdatabase language except, possibly, SQL.andP;  But dBase IV 1.1 is simply a dBaseIV 1.0 that works, and two years on that may not quite be enough.andP;  Thecompetition is two years more experienced and two years further along theroad to full client-server database management.andP;  Companies like Nantucket andFox Software are carefully disentangling themselves from their dBase rootsand selling on their own merits for just about the first time.andM;dBase IV 1.1 is Ashton-Tate's last chance to get back on the database bus,let alone be the conductor.andP;  Still, it's faster and will now run more happilywith networks; developer loyalty may be enough to pull it through to a rosymultiple-platform future, with the Server edition and the long-lostProfessional Compiler arriving at last to give it a marketing kick.andP;  ButdBase IV looks the same today as it looked in 1988, and a software developerthat loses two years tends to lose whatever race it's in.andM;The chronicle of dBase IVandM;dBase has had one of the most improbable gestations of any major PC productor recent years.andP;  Casualties of the hugely delayed database include a loyaluser base which has drifted off to other products, and chairman and chiefexecutive Ed Esber Jnr.andM;Here's the full story as chronicled in the pages of PC User.andM;* February 1988: Ashton-Tate and Microsoft announced a unique collaborationto provide an alternative to OS/2 Extended Edition.andP;  &quot;TheAshton-Tate/Microsoft SQL Server is a database engine based on Sybase, afield-proven DECVAX structured query language,&quot; says Floyd Bradley, vicepresident of Ashton-Tate.andP;  System requirements are said to be heavy.andM;* March 1988: Details of dBase IV are announced.andP;  It's to include a built-incompiler, a new interface for non-programmers and SQL support.andP;  Versions forPresentation Manager and OS/2 Extended Edition will be available before theend of the year.andP;  Paul Sloane, UK managing director, says: &quot;The programcontains 400,000 lines of code, of which only 50,000 are carried over fromdBase III.&quot;andP;  In order to get the OS/2 bandwagon out of the mud, IBM givesAshton-Tate access to its corporate customer base in return for announcingdBase IV six monts early.andM;* April 1988: It becomes clear that the first version of dBase IV won't beable to exploit all the features of SQL Server.andP;  According to Paul Sloane,the product was developed before the SQL specifications had been finalised.andM;* May 1988: Ashton-Tate acquires 20 per cent of the equity and a seat on theboard of Interbase Software, a supplier of distributed database managementtechnology for Sun Apollo and DEC VAX computers.andP;  Floyd Bradley, Europeanvice-president, says: &quot;It's really dBase V we're talking about here&quot;.andM;* May/June 1988: Ashton-Tate invests between 3 and 4 million dollars inSybase.andM;* June/July 1988: Ashton-Tate extends the window for release of dBase IV.andO;It's no longer tied to the 31 July deadline, but will appear any time between1 July and 31 September this year.andM;* November 1988: dBase IV for DOS ships, with OS/2 versions promised &quot;aroundthe turn of the year.&quot;andP;  It can't yet communicate with SQL Server--whichhasn't been shipped yet - but will be able to when the product appears in thefirst quarter of 1989.andP;  Also, according to Joan Chesney, head of customersupport at Ashton-Tate: &quot;dBase IV needs 520Kb of RAM and it doesn't make useof anything above 640KB.andP;  So, when running large applications, everythingwill slow down or a 'deficient memory' message will be displayed.&quot;andO;Ashton-Tate claims that initial orders in the UK already exceed 2 millionpounds.andM;* December 1988: Floyd Bradley says: &quot;Fox and the Santa Cruz Operation as oneof their contributory infringers, have violated our copyright in terms of thelook and feel of dBase II, III and III Plus, and it's their slated intentionto do the same with IV.&quot;andM;* February 1989: Ashton-Tate announces details of version 1.1 amid complaintsthat the original product contains serious bugs.andP;  Version 1.1 expands SQLsupport and addresses some of the complaints by users about the way itinterfaces to SQL.andP;  Most serious of these is that under certain conditions;the same query phrased in two different ways results in either two differentanswers or incomplete information.andP;  Version 1.1 also reduces the amount ofmemory the product requires and increases its speed.andP;  The company alsoannounces details of the Professional Compiler to &quot;meet the needs ofprofessional heavyweight developers.&quot;andP;  Version 1.1 is due to appear on 30April.andM;* April 1989: Release of Professional Compiler is put back until the end ofthe year, following allegations that some sections of dBase IV are impossibleto compile.andP;  Rumours circulate that Ashton-Tate will split its product linein two - one for 8088/8086-based machines and a second for 286 and 386machines.andM;* June/July 1989: UK managing director Paul Sloane dismisses allegations thatversion 1.0 contains too many bugs as a &quot;gross misrepresentation&quot;.andO;Ashton-Tage confirms that Version 1.1 will now be delayed until the autumn.andO;Stories circulate that a version of dBase for Windows 3.0 may be launchedbefore the end of the year.andM;* August 1989: Figures from market research company Romtec show that betweenMarch and May, dBase IV's share of the database market fell by 21.4 per centwhile dBase III increased its take by 10.7 per cent.andM;* August/September 1989: Ashton-Tate admits that dBase IV 1.1 won't appearuntil 1990, and confirms reports in PC User that it will split the upgradeinto two separate releases.andP;  Only the 286/386 version will contain hooks forSQL servers.andP;  Floyd Bradley declines to give new shipping dates, but saysthat beta testing starts in October and that it won't ship until three monthsafter that.andM;* October/November 1989: A fix issued by Ashton-Tate in August to solve alabel printing problem doesn't work properly.andP;  Another fix is issued.andM;* January 1990: Microsoft removes Ashton-Tate's sole right to sell its SQLdatabase server, because - nearly two years after the original announcement -the company still can't provide the necessary link to dBase IV.andP;  Under thenew deal, Ashton-Tate can still sell the server, but only non-exclusively andonly until 31 July.andP;  After that it has to sell it bundled with dBase.andP;  If theserver-suporting version 1.1 of dBase isn't out by 31 July.andP;  Ashton-Tate muststop selling the server until it appears.andP;  The Ashton-Tate/Microsoft SQLServer is renamed SQL Server.andM;* February 1990: Ashton-Tate announces that dBase IV will be made availableon Sun workstations, but UK marketing manager Chris Mossing confirms that theagreement with Sun is contingent on shipping the DOS version first.andM;* March/April 1990: Mossing believes that the Server Edition of version 1.1will arrive in the fourth quarter of 1990, thus missing Microsoft's 31 Julydeadline.andM;* May 1990: Ashton-Tate's net losses for the period ending 30 March are $1million compared to $1.4 million in the previous quarter.andP;  Revenues over thesame period are down from $87 million to $57 million.andM;* May/June 1990: Ed Esber resigns as chairman and chief executive officer ofAshton-Tate after five years, amid speculation that the company is beinggroomed for sale.andM;* August 1990: As PC User goes to press Ashton-Tate confirms it will unvelldBase IV 1.1 on 2 August - 18 months after its original promised shipmentdate of 30 April 1989 Harry Wong, chief scientist for the data productsdivision, says that the long delay is the result of a bottom up rewrite ofthe application code and an exhaustive test programme.andP;  Ashton-Tate claims tohave done 5 million automated tests, spent 45,000 man hours in testing andquality assurance and subjected the product to 3,000 hours of multi-usertesting.andP;  The program is said to have been tested at 2,700 sites around theworld.andP;  Wong suggests that dBase IV is the most tested piece of PC softwareever.andM;Clones and competitorsandM;Any industry-standard software package soon acquires a retinue of add-in,add-on, and bolt-on applications developed by third parties to fill gaps inthe main package.andP;  Where would Lotus and Autodesk be without their add-ins,macro packages, and plug-in AutoLisp routines?andP;  And where would Ashton-Tatebe without its third-party dBase development aids?andM;The simple answer is that it would probably be a lot better off.andP;  Two of itsmain competitors in the high-end programmable database market, Nantucket andFox Software, started life on the back of the dBase standard by offeringdBase program compilers and faster clone versions of dBase III Plus, and havenow moved beyond the standard to compete with dBase IV 1.1 directly.andM;Both Nantucket and Fox, with Clipper 5.0 and FoxPro respectively, are nowattempting to distance themselves from dBase altogether, and are presentingtheir packages as complete application development environments that happento run dBase III Plus code as an added extra.andM;Indeed, Nantucket's president Larry Heimendinger is on record as saying thatthere's &quot;no way we'll chase the dBase IV marketplace&quot;.andP;  But an as yet unnamedthird-party Clipper developer, using the new user-defined command features inClipper 5.0, does plan to produce a dBase IV-compatible package in the nearfuture.andM;Fox is in an even stronger position.andP;  Having competed hard with dBase IIIPlus on speed and capacity, it moved successfully to the Macintosh with fullgraphical user interface support, but without losing dBase programcompatibility; this is something that Ashton-Tate hasn't yet managed.andM;And FoxPro for DOS adds a smooth character-based windowing front-end,available instantly for users and ready for developers to build into theirapplications, with full mouse support.andM;Again, Ashton-Tate is nowhere near that point yet.andP;  There was some criticismthat dBase IV 1.0's setup program supported the mouse while the main programdidn't.andP;  The company has 'solved' this in 1.1 by removing mouse support fromthe setup program.andM;And in dBase IV 1.1, windows are still rudimentary from a developer's portionof view.andP;  For example, although 1.1 allows interrupt procedures to do thingslike draw new windows on the screen, failing to use the new SAVE SCREENcommand in the right place can cause the program '@...andP;  GET&quot; prompt, andresult in a Big Red Switch crash.andP;  Real windowing systems avoid suchproblems.andM;Some of the dBase III Plus add-on producers will have a rather leaner time inthe future, as dBase IV 1.1 adds superior forms design and report layoutfunctions.andP;  However, a new breed of packages like dB Publisher has emerged,that address the needs of users who want DTP-quality output, and dBase IV 1.1still needs these, thanks to the lack of graphics import, charting and properPostScript printing facilities.andM;It's doubtful, though, whether any true dBase IV clones will appear at all.andO;Nantucket and Fox appear confident enough to lead their users in otherdirections altogether, while Ashton-Tate's litigious nature will discouragepotential cloners from emulating the dBase IV look and feel.andP;  And onceAshton-Tate releases the near-legendary Professional Compiler for dBase IV1.1 -- now apparently in a lengthy beta-test stage -- there'll be lessincentive for anyone to attempt to enhance the basic package in thatdirection.andM;The conclusion is that in dBase IV 1.1, except on the reporting side,commercial applications will be the real way to add valueandM;* Fox Software is on (0462) 421999andM;* Nantucket is on (0707) 373600andM;The report generatorandM;Although the report generator in dBase IV was a vast improvement over the onein dBase III Plus, with a simple 'band' structure apparently lifted wholesalefrom dBase Mac, there've been no more changes in 1.1.andP;  And the one changethat ought to make a real difference to reporting -- the addition of aPostScript printer driver with the package -- is a real disappointment.andM;When Ashton-Tate says that the package now supports PostScript printers, youmight suppose that this means typeset-quality reports and presentations.andP;  Infact, you'd be wrong.andP;  As far as dBase IV is concerned, a PostScript printeris just another device using mono-spaced fonts, like a daisywheel printer.andO;As a result, anyone attempting to use proportionally spaced fonts at varioussizes will be rewarded with output full of misaligned columns and text, andwill have no way of knowing how any given report format will appear on paper.andM;This comes about because dBase IV 1.1, like Ashton-Tate's MultiMate 4.0, is amono-spaced package attempting to adapt to a proportionally spaced worldrather late in the day.andP;  So while any self-respecting PostScript printercomes with around 35 resident typefaces that can be printed in any size,dBase IV 1.1 only allows three to be used, in three fixed sizes, in anysingle dBase session or program.andP;  Control of the printer involves typingmacros or editing the POSTSCRI.DLD PostScript program that's sent to theprinter to set up defaults.andM;For instance, changing the three fonts available in the Words menu of theForm and Report design screens involves editing POSTSCRI.DLD to alter thebuilt-in fonts that dBase IV's internal font settings point at, And switchingthe default paper size from US Letter to A4, say, means another delve intothis file with a text editor and a steady hand with PostScript'sreverse-Polish notation.andM;There's nothing more symbolic of dBase IV's elderly design than this.andP;  In aword where presentation is becoming increasingly important, this level ofPostScript and proportional font support is almost as unacceptable as it wasin MultiMate 4.0.andM;Platform changeandM;While the convoluted development of dBase IV 1.1 was under way, Ashton-Tate'sreorganised programming teams were also working on how to port it to as manydifferent hardware and operating system platforms as possible, to positionthe company as the leader in cross-platform database operation.andM;This is quite different from the client-server applications that will beaddressed by the SQL-based Server Edition of dBase IV 1.1 when it ships laterthis year.andP;  Instead, the idea is that it should be possible to transfer dBaseIV data, index and other files in an unchanged form from environment toenvironment, and that dBase programs written on one machine should rununchanged on any other.andM;At the 1.1 launch, just one of these cross-platform versions was officiallyannounced -- for DEC VAX VMS -- although others were on show in demonstrationversions.andM;The VAX version is typical of the breed.andP;  Although it takes advantage of VMSfeatures such as Network Applications Support (NAS) for distributed programs,virtual memory and file security, it keeps the character-based look and feelof dBase IV for DOS.andP;  Source code files, data files and compiled object filescan be moved unchanged from VAXes to PCs and back.andP;  Also, using NASfunctions, dBase IV can act as a front-end for databases created in DEC'srelational Rdb package, whether those databases are on a local machine or ona remote server connected via DECNet.andM;In fact, although Ashton-Tate doesn't mention it explicitly, dBase IV for VAXis also the first announcement of the Server Edition.andP;  The routines used toaccess Rdb servers via NAS will be used in the DOS Server Edition to accessSQL database servers like Oracle, SQL Server and OS/2 Extended Edition.andM;The VAX package, due to ship in the last quarter of this year, is a fulldBase IV 1.1 implementation, with the Control Centre front-end and all theapplication development tools.andP;  In contrast, the dBase IV Runtime Pluspackage announced for the Macintosh is primarily a way of running dBase IVprograms unchanged in a Macintosh environment.andM;But, it also includes the dBase language and 'dot prompt' support, so thatapplications can be moved across from the PC or VAX, modified on theMacintosh and then sent back to run unchanged on PC or VAX machines.andP;  Also,dBase data files can be browsed and edited on the Macintosh screen, andapplications and data can be shared by PCs and Macintoshes on an AppleTalknetwork.andM;On the Macintosh, however, dBase IV Runtime Plus looks like an 80x25 PC textscreen running in a window.andP;  The only Macintosh user interface features aremouse support in text editing and browse screens, or in user-defined menusinside dBase applications, support for Macintosh printers like theImageWriter II; and the ability to run in the background under MultiFinder.andM;Missing, on the other hand, are the Control Centre, the Forms, Report andLabel Designers, the Query-by-Example functions, the Application Generator,the Template Language for developers and any SQL capability.andP;  Pricing andavailability of the package haven't yet been announced and its appearance atthe Macworld Expo in August seemed to be part of an awareness campaign ratherthan a true product announcement.andM;Similarly, the promised versions for SCO Unix System V.2, Windows 3.0 and PMhave no firm shipping dates yet, and the SCO version might present someembarrassment, due to Ashton-Tate's current lawsuit against SCO itself.andO;Another text-based version, for DEC's Ultrix version of Unix running on MIPSRISC processors, has also been announced, along with graphics-based versionsfor DECwindows under both VMS and Ultrix, but again there are no firmshipping dates.andM;The next shipping version of dBase IV 1.1 should be a text-based package forSun SPARC workstations.andP;  Ashton-Tate is committed to delivering this by theend of the year.andP;  Like the VAX package, it will have to look and feel of thePC version while also taking advantage of Sun's networking, multi-tasking andmulti-user features.andM;But the real priority inside Ashton-Tate must be the Windows 3.0implementation.andP;  A test version of dBase IV for Windows has been hawkedaround so many seminars and developers' conferences that it must be feelingtired, and surely the company's first real stab at a graphics-based dBasecan't be delayed much longer.andP;  the graphics-based dBase Mac for the Macintoshdoesn't really count, because it didn't run dBase code and even had troubleefficiently converting dBase data files.andP;  However, dBase-compatibles likeFoxbase Plus and dBFast Windows show what could be done.andM;It seems, however, that Ashton-Tate is keeping out of the murkygraphics-based software waters for now and concentrating on the text-basedmarket it understands.andP;  And that might be sensible.andP;  Database users on VAXand Sun systems may well find dBase IV 1.1's Control Centre and ApplicationGenerator a revelation after the software they've been forced to work with,while Macintosh and Windows 3.0 users have already established databasevendors and users, who'll be ready to snipe at Ashton-Tate if it puts agraphics-based foot wrong.andM;In a world that's moving further towards client-server applications, themultiple-platform approach looks a little odd.andP;  After all, any front-end ismeant to be able to access any database server using SQL, and before itpulled out of its deal with Microsoft and Sybase, Ashton-Tate planned toposition dBase IV as a front-end package rather than an enterprise-wideapplication.andM;However, the SQL client-server market has yet to settle down.andP;  And there areplenty of dBase applications out there whose developers could profitably movethem onto VAX and Sun machines and even to the Macintosh.andP;  Running suchapplications with dBase IV Run-time Plus, without the standard Macintosh userinterface, will probably only be done where absolutely necessary, though.andM;Still, pending a true SQL revolution, Ashton-Tate is sticking to itsmulti-platform development strategy.andP;  And, like Lotus before it, it's onlyfilling in the shipment date jigsaw one piece at a time.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
