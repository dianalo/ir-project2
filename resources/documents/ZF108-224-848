(products).andO;Product:   WordPerfect 5.1 (Word processing software).andO;Topic:     Word Processing SoftwareEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WP 5.1: Forget GUIs, it's full speed ahead!andM;While others have been busily releasing word processors for the Windowsenvironment, WordPerfect Corp. has, for the time being, been content to takethe best character-based word processor on the market and make it evenbetter.andM;WordPerfect 5.1 is not a breakthrough product.andP;  It is essentially arefinement of the concepts introduced in WordPerfect 5.0.andP;  Nonetheless, itadds some new tricks -- menus and mice, for instance.andP;  To older WP users,using a mouse with WordPerfect might seem as anomalous as munching a Big Macin Moscow, but the facilities are nicely integrated and should ease some ofthe learning curve for new users.andM;Business users will appreciate four of WP 5.1's new capabilities links toLotus and Excel spreadsheets, table processing, simplified label printingand, at last, conditional merging.andM;When WP 5.1 is linked to a spreadsheet, the values change when thespreadsheet is changed.andP;  Table processing, the star of the WP 5.1enhancements, is worth the upgrade for that one feature alone.andP;  The ease andflexibility of the table editor enable any user to createpresentation-quality tables.andM;Merge commandsandM;WP 5.1 merge commands can finally make logical choices based on the contendsof the data in the merge file.andM;For example, a primary document can be merged with a secondary file ofCanadian-wide addresses to print out letters or labels narrowed down toresidents of Manitoba or any other province.andM;For network administrators, WP 5.1 comes up roses.andP;  Designed to operate onmost LANs, it provides network installation and network maintenanceutilities.andM;Administrators can set up system-wide defaults and assign network printers.andO;Individuals may set up personal defaults that override the system-widedefaults.andP;  In addition, WordPerfect Corp. maintains a dedicated telephonenumber for network support.andM;Academics, scientists and engineers will appreciate WP 5.1's equationprocessor.andP;  For the first time in a mainline word processor, users are ableto compose and print out complex mathematical equations.andM;Likewise, those who deal with multilingual documents will be able to takeadvantage of the new scheme for printing the over 1,500 characters availablefrom WordPerfect.andM;Virtually any printer with graphics can print the characters, which includeHebrew, Cyrillics, Greek, typographic symbols, iconic symbols andmultinnational characters.andP;  The characters are displayed onscreen in previewmode.andM;To accommodate the more sophisticated merge and macro facilities of WP 5.1,the macro language has acquired several new commands.andP;  WP 5.0 macros need notbe changed to work in 5.1, but editing must take place in the new 5.1built-in macro editor.andM;On the Desktop publishing side.andP;  WP 5.1 has subtly altered and improvedseveral of its defaults for kerning, leading and relative-size font scaling.andO;Documents created in 5.0 will need to be adjusted in 5.1 to print outidentically.andM;Text and graphics display drivers for WP 5.1 offer more options than those ofWP 5.0.andP;  The VGA option, for instance, allow text displays of 80 columns by25, 28, 43, or 50 lines.andM;The unusual 28-line option is very attractive and destined for popularity.andM;There are drivers that will allow certain video cards to display 132 columnsof text.andP;  SuperVGA and 8514/A graphics are supported for graphics previewing.andO;As with printers, the list of supported video devices continues to grow.andM;Overall, WordPerfect 5.1 displays the excellence that has characterized laterreleases of 5.0.andP;  Nonetheless, there are a few minor bugs to be addressed.andO;Access to the extended WordPerfect character set varies considerably inquality from printer to printer.andM;For instance, I obtained good results printing symbols and foreign-languagecharacters on an HP DeskJet Plus.andP;  Ironically, the same file sent to aPostScript printer looked terrible.andP;  The PostScript version of the WPcharacter set shows signs of hasty development.andM;Quibbles aside, this is an upgrade that will bring deep satisfaction toexperienced WordPerfect users.andP;  There are small but thoughtful improvementslurking in nearly every WP function.andM;The care lavished on this upgrade is impressive and explains why WordPerfectcontinues to attract new users and to hold old ones.andM;While there are other word processors with strengths of their own, there isnothing that matches the breadth and depth of WordPerfect 5.1.andP;  They justdon't come any better than this.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
