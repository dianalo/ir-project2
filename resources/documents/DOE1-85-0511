Dramatic changes in theuse of the databases, and anticipated explosive growth of the availabledata motivated this attempt to outline future requirements. Present databases,in particular the nucleotide sequence database maintained by the EMBLData Library and GenBank, are already facing the challenges presentedby this rapid evolution. Sequencing the human genome is within reachof emerging technology, and recent discussions have emphasized the needfor improved methods for maintaining and processing the wealth of sequenceand related information that would be generated by sequencing on thatscale. The future research needs of biologists were discussed in conjunctionwith the developments in the technology of data storage, transmissionand processing that might be expected to satisfy these needs. To supportthis, it was recommended that an international advisory committee beestablished. The committee, to be composed of experts from the fieldsof molecular biology and information sciences, will provide advice andguidance in this crucial stage in the development of the databases.</TEXT></DOC>
