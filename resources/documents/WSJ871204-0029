Seib</HL><DD> 12/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   On one hand, there is Republican Pierre du Pont, who says: &quot;If I could be as good a president as Ronald Reagan, I'd be delighted.&quot;    On the other hand, there is Democrat Jesse Jackson, who says Ronald Regan has given America &quot;guided missiles and misguided leadership.&quot;    Somewhere in between are the other presidential candidates, all trying to handle the prickly problem of Ronald Reagan's legacy. It isn't easy. Mr. Reagan remains a basically popular president credited with restoring American confidence and shifting the American political debate to a more conservative track. Yet, particularly in the wake of October's stock market crash, he also increasingly is viewed as a flawed and detached leader who allowed scandals on his watch and failed to act as such problems as the trade and budget deficits grew by leaps and bounds.    The net result is that Republican and Democratic candidates alike are embracing some broad themes of Reaganism while running away from Mr. Reagan on many of the details.    Mitch Daniels, a former Reagan White House aide who now is at the Hudson Institute, asserts that despite the recent tarnish on his image, the president has succeeded in bringing a &quot;Reagan paradigm&quot; to American politics -- three fundamental philosophies that &quot;are almost beyond debate now.&quot;    The first is &quot;the primacy of economic growth as a societal goal,&quot; Mr. Daniels says. The second is the virtue of low tax rates; the bipartisan support for last year's tax overhaul illustrated the broad acceptance of that philosophy. And finally, Mr. Daniels says, President Reagan has made &quot;strong skepticism&quot; of the Soviet Union a widely accepted theme. &quot;There aren't any apologists left, really,&quot; he says.    The measure of how widely accepted these philosophies have become is how often their overtones creep into Democratic rhetoric. So, for example, Democrats talk of a more productive relationship with the private sector, and even Mr. Jackson, the most liberal of Democratic candidates, carefully mentions the need to maintain military strength while trimming the defense budget.    But in the wake of the market crash, Democrats are sharpening their attacks on the Reagan-era budget deficits. They also charge that the Reagan administration has been callous, talk of a more equitable sharing of the bigger pie promised by economic growth, and assert that billions have been squandered by lax management of the defense buildup.    And Republicans, after singing the predictable odes to Mr. Reagan's leadership, are marching to his right on foreign-policy issues like arms control and aid to Nicaragua's rebels. In addition, few are warmly embracing Reaganomics, for fear that repercussions from the stock market crash and the &quot;twin tower&quot; budget and trade deficits could send the economy sliding into a recession before Election Day.    Democrats and Republicans alike think the economy remains the big question mark punctuating the Reagan presidency. &quot;The timing of a recession is going to be the key to the legacy in the election and how they talk about Reagan in the long run,&quot; says Republican strategist Kevin Phillips. &quot;Republicans have regularly lost elections on recessions. That's the party vulnerability.&quot;    A look at some statistics illustrates the problem in gauging the Reagan legacy. As the numbers suggest, it is hard to decide whether nearly seven years of Reagan rule have fundamentally altered the economy and ushered in an era of prosperity, or produced only superficial changes that resulted in a temporary high the nation already is being forced to pay for.    In 1980, the year Mr. Reagan was elected, the gross national product declined; last year it grew. Inflation dropped sharply over those same Reagan years, and unemployment fell. All those statistics suggest a Reagan record that Republicans can show off in 1988.    But at the same time, the budget deficit has more than doubled and the trade deficit has more than quadrupled. And, largely because of Mr. Reagan's big defense buildup and the mounting cost of servicing the federal debt, the notion that he has trimmed government spending is a myth: Federal spending as a percentage of GNP actually has risen slightly.    All this means that, despite the early Reagan successes, there is a growing public sense of unease about the future as the parties gear up for 1988. Not even the president's most cherished accomplishments are sacrosanct. The defense budget, for instance, actually is dropping slightly in inflation-adjusted terms as Congress begins imposing more austerity.    Increasingly, even Republican presidential candidates see that there is mileage in edging away from elements of Reaganomics. Even before the market slide, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas began suggesting that &quot;maybe we went a little too far on the tax cut of 1981. Maybe a little too far on defense spending in early years.&quot; Never a fan of supply-side economics, he warns voters about the deficit: &quot;We aren't going to grow out of it. We've got to make some tough decisions.&quot;    &quot;The Reagan revolution is largely one of promises unrealized politically,&quot; asserts Kirk O'Donnell, a Democratic policy analyst. He suggests that Democrats may not run directly away from Reaganomics but rather try to take advantage of Americans' concern &quot;that the foundation of their economic future isn't as firm as it should be. . . . I don't think at this point Americans are looking for a right turn, left turn or U-turn. They're just looking for a speedup so these cars from Japan and Germany don't pass us on the highway.&quot;    Democrats favor the pending arms treaty with the Soviets to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons, and generally continue to oppose Contra aid. But even in the Democratic party, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee has begun making some headway by sounding more Reaganesque on some foreign policy issues. And Michael Dukakis, a liberal in foreign policy, says defense spending can be reduced by eliminating big-ticket weapons, but the Massachusetts governor also says the amount of cutting depends on progress in negotiations with the Soviets to reduce arms.    If the Democrats won't necessarily be running from the Reagan legacy, the Republicans won't be wholeheartedly embracing it. For instance, with the exception of Vice President George Bush, all the Republican candidates have expressed concern over, or outright opposition to, the Soviet arms deal. And all the Republicans are strongly supporting continued aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, despite the beginnings of a peace process in Central America. These positions are clearly aimed at winning the hearts of hard-right Republicans, whose dominant position in the party is yet another part of the Reagan legacy.    Coping with the Reagan legacy is a particularly touchy problem for Mr. Bush, who must function as a Reagan administration official and as a candidate at the same time. Thus, he can share some of the Reagan popularity but can't make clear breaks with the president even when he might want to.    The Bush camp is trying to handle the problem by looking for areas where, without saying President Reagan has done something wrong, Mr. Bush can assert that he would do more. These areas will include education, where Mr. Bush has proposed new savings bonds to finance college tuitions; agriculture, where he has called for &quot;rural enterprise zones&quot; and an international summit on agriculture policy; the environment; and chemical and biological arms control. And, in a modest departure from Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush has called for a reduction in the capital gains tax for individuals.    Beyond such policy issues, though, the Reagan legacy may loom largest in an intangible area: how candidates describe the presidency itself. Largely because of his effectiveness in his first two years, Mr. Reagan has illustrated that one man using the White House's immense powers of communication can lift the mood of the nation and alter the way it does business. It will be hard for candidates, or future presidents, to complain again about malaise in the country or the unbearable burdens of the presidency.    &quot;I think what you'll basically hear from all the Republicans, and also from the eventual nominee, is that Reagan proved we can do things differently here, he gave us some confidence, and we've got to continue those two things,&quot; says John Sears, a former Reagan campaign manager. As for Democrats, he adds, &quot;I don't think you argue with those two things. You just don't get up and say them yourself.&quot;    ---   Mr. Seib covers the White House from The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau.    ---                       The Reagan Legacy                               Pre-Reagan      Most Recent                                 (1980)      (As of 9/30/87)    Inflation (annual     percent change in     consumer price index)        13.5%           4.8%    Unemployment (civilian)        7.1%           6.3%    Americans below poverty     level                        13.0%          13.6%*    GNP growth (inflation     adjusted)                    -0.2%           3.6%    Personal savings     (as a percent of     disposable personal income)   7.1%           3.5%    Federal spending     (fiscal years, as a percent     of GNP)                      22.1%          24.0%    U.S. net international     investment position     (in billions of dollars)    $106.3       $-330.0**    Defense spending (fiscal     years, in billions of     dollars)                    $134.0        $282.0    U.S. strategic nuclear     forces (total number     of warheads)                10,608        11,786    *Latest figure available, 1986    **Estimate as of June 30, 1987    Sources: Arms Control Associaiton; Commerce Department;Bureau of Labor Statistics; Office of Management and Budget</TEXT></DOC>
