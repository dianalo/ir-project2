Marquis de Vauban, the Frenchmilitary engineer, devised for the Nuremberg toymakers an army thatcould march, fire, reload and even retreat, all in sterling silver.   Marie Antoinette, who loved and collected toys all her life, wasshown a doll in an artist's smock by Henri Jaquez Druz, whosemechanical marvels delighted the Spanish royal family and justmissed being condemned as diabolical and burned at the stake by theInquisition. The doll proceeded to sketch a credible likeness ofthe French queen as she sat for her portrait.   Alas, Marie Antoinette little realized then that her fate andthat of her husband, Louis XVI, would create a demand for toyguillotines. Goethe asked a friend to bring him one from Paris.   Grim toys have been as enduringly popular as Grimm's fairytales. Children in ages past played with a live bird on a string,kept crickets in a cage, trained mice to pull wagons. Puppet showsmade ogres of dwarfs, hunchbacks and cripples. Toy catalogs beforeWorld War I featured a musical model of the Titantic that played``Nearer My God to Thee'' as it sank in the bathtub.   Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtle swords and nunchakus, amultimillion-dollar hit in this year's toy market after the successof the movie, have been blamed for an increase in playgroundviolence in Australia and are banned from many classrooms.   Clay horses and wooden knights fueled the fervor of the 30,000boys and girls who followed Stephen, a French shepherd boy, on theChildren's Crusade in 1212. Many lost their lives in the deadlygame of trying to free the Holy Land from the infidel.   Toys of war were part of the education of a prince. Charles V ofFrance, also known as Charles the Mad, received a toy cannon forChristmas in 1383. Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empireordered toy knights that could be dislodged from their horses forhis 10-year-old son Ludwig. Six years later the lad was unhorsedand killed fighting the Turks. The future Louis XIV received forChristmas two sterling silver armies, each with a troop strength of30 regiments of cavalry and infantry.   Then as now toy soldiers went to war with the most modernweapons. This year G.I. Joe is mounted on the ``Hum-Vee,'' thenew-model Army jeep widely deployed on Operation Desert Shield inthe Persian Gulf.   We think of toyland as a fantasy world of make-believe, but themost successful playthings always reproduced reality as the childexperieced it. Down through the centuries chariots and archers, thestag hunt and farm and forest scenes gave way to royal carriages,cowboys and Indians, horse-drawn trolleys, Model T Fords, dumptrucks, highway trailers, jet planes, rockets and space shuttlesand now a laptop computer just like Dad's or Mom's.   Toymakers keep up with the times. A political cartoon poking funat Theodore Roosevelt's sparing the life of a bear cub on a huntingexpedition inspired the Ideal Toy Co. to ask permission to name astuffed toy for him. ``I don't think my name is worth much to thetoy bear cub business, but you are welcome to use it,'' thepresident answered, underestimating the still potent sales clout ofthe teddy bear.   Along with the merry melody of the cash box, the dream world oftoys has inspired countless poems, paintings, operas, ballets,plays, movies and pop songs. Robert Louis Stevenson's nostalgicevocation of his own sickly childhood is among the nicest:   ``And sometimes for an hour or so   ``I watch my leaden soldiers go   ``With different uniforms and drills   ``Among the bedclothes through the hills.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
