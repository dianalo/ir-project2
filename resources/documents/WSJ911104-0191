Olsen to identify candidates to succeedhim at the nation's second-largest computer maker.   As a first step, John F. Smith, 56 years old, a seniorvice president, is expected to be named to the new post ofchief operating officer, Digital insiders say.</LP><TEXT>   But the 65-year-old Mr. Olsen -- who has headed Digitalsince it was started in 1957, making him perhaps thelongest-running chief executive of a major U.S. company --shows little interest in relinquishing authority.   &quot;I'm not going to crown anyone,&quot; Mr. Olsen said in aninterview. &quot;There's no need to discuss succession when thechief executive is young and healthy.&quot; Moreover, he added,while the issue is &quot;the prerogative of the board . . . if Ifound any of them talked to the press about this, I'd firethem.&quot;   Mr. Olsen, of course, can't fire directors. But hiscomment underscores the extent to which Digital'seight-member board is dominated by him -- unlike theinvestor-led board of Compaq Computer Corp., which becameimpatient with poor results and last month abruptly firedco-founder and chief executive Joseph &quot;Rod&quot; Canion. Inaddition, insiders say that Mr. Olsen doesn't want to appearto be reacting to pressure, and thus might delay anyexecutive changes.   No one thinks Mr. Olsen should be forced out. Indeed, somesay that his strategic decision-making is critical to Digitalat a time when the entire computer industry is reeling fromchanging technology and lower profit margins. &quot;The irony isthat Ken may be the only one who can lead them&quot; through thistransition, says C. Gordon Bell, who spent 23 years atDigital, designing the flagship VAX computer line, beforedeparting in 1983.   But the succession issue nonetheless has caused concernamong some investors as well as directors, and not simplybecause Mr. Olsen has reached age 65. Digital's results havebeen weak for more than a year, they note, and the companyneeds to bolster top management to respond more quickly toindustry changes.   Already, Mr. Olsen's difficulty in letting go may havecost Digital some talent. Six vice presidents have resignedrecently, including the well-regarded chief financialofficer, James M. Osterhoff, who was on the losing end of adispute with Mr. Smith about financial restructuring. Mr.Smith is regarded as Mr. Olsen's loyal lieutenant.   &quot;Ken has a fundamental aversion to letting anyone elsebecome a leader. He sees them as a threat. This hurtsDigital's management by driving out good people,&quot; says asenior executive who recently left the company.   Moreover, Mr. Olsen's critics say he has been making majordecisions in a vacuum -- without a healthy dose of dissent --and that some of the results have hurt. For example, theysay, Mr. Olsen sunk $1 billion into an ill-fated mainframecomputer line at a time when big machines were losing out tosmaller, simpler designs. They also say Mr. Olsen moved tooslowly to make badly needed cuts in the work force anddelayed by at least a year a redesign of the flagship VAXline with new chip technology.   On key decisions, Mr. Olsen &quot;has been essentially talkingto himself for a decade,&quot; says Mr. Bell, the former Digitalexecutive. &quot;He's got all these listeners and no one who willargue with him and tell him that he's wrong.&quot;   Executives say the succession issue has sparked concern onthe eight-member board. Philip Caldwell, former chairman ofFord Motor Co., has been pushing Mr. Olsen to step up hissuccession planning, they say. Mr. Caldwell didn't returncalls made to his office. In May, the board began addressingthe problem in earnest, but put a decision on hold to dealwith more immediate strategic and operating challenges, saythose familiar with the board's thinking.   &quot;Ken Olsen is at a fork in the road,&quot; says JeffreySonnenfeld, a management scholar and author of &quot;The Hero'sFarewell,&quot; a study of succession. The way a chief executivehandles succession can cap a long career or tarnish it, hesuggests, depending on whether he relinquishes powergracefully or becomes a &quot;corporate monarch, one who does notretire, but wears his crown to the end.&quot; He calls Mr. Olsen&quot;one of the industry's last great heroes,&quot; who imposed hisown moral code and even his eccentricities on the company hebuilt.   Mr. Olsen insisted in an interview that talking aboutsuccession is a waste of time. &quot;There isn't a big emphasis ontitles around here,&quot; he said. As for promoting Mr. Smith, hesaid that &quot;we may do that someday,&quot; but that a new titlewould just reflect &quot;what he's already doing today.&quot;   Pier Carlo Falotti, chief executive of Digital's hugeEuropean operations, is also on anyone's short list ofinternal candidates to ultimately succeed Mr. Olsen. Mr.Olsen also has said he may look to a new generation ofmanagers. They include such fast-track executives as RobertB. Palmer, a former United Technologies Corp. executive whoruns manufacturing, and David L. Stone, Digital'shigh-profile software chief.   Still, a handful of heirs apparent has emerged over theyears, only to lose favor and be forced out of the company.&quot;Being identified as a potential heir at Digital is likepainting a bulls-eye on your forehead,&quot; says a formerexecutive.   Digital is caught in a wave of change sweeping theindustry. Smaller and faster machines are eroding its marketposition, forcing it to shutter plants, shift resources andcut its swollen payroll. These moves have exacted a toll: Inthe fiscal year ended June 29, Digital took $1.1 billion inrestructuring charges, causing a first-ever annual loss of$617 million. Digital's revenue rose just 7% to $13.91billion, with a paltry 1% increase in product sales bolsteredby a 16% gain in services and software.   The company still has vast resources, of course: a broadcustomer base, almost no debt and $2 billion in cash. Some ofits businesses are surging, such as computer systemsintegration and networking. And criticism of the mainframeproject and the pace of layoffs is just &quot;20-20 hindsight&quot; bypoorly informed outsiders, a spokesman says.   But the current VAX computer design, which fueledphenomenal growth for a decade, is running out of gas. As aresult, the company is preparing for a risky transition to amore advanced computer technology.   Mr. Olsen has said he plans to stay at Digital's helm atleast through the introduction of the next-generationcomputer chip, code-named project Alpha. Designed to powerDigital through the rest of the decade, it is expectedsometime next year. The new design is an advanced RISC(reduced instruction-set computer) chip that analysts sayshould yield huge performance gains at a low cost.   Digital's own RISC chip development -- now slated to bethe VAX successor -- was slowed by Mr. Olsen's 1989 decisionto stop work on an internal RISC project in favor of a designby now-struggling MIPS Computer Systems Inc. While the movehelped in the short term in the competitive workstationmarket, it effectively delayed development of the criticallyimportant follow-on to the VAX, says Mr. Bell, the former VAXengineer. And it led to the loss of David Cutler, &quot;one of thebest system designers in the world,&quot; a Digital executivesays. He left for Microsoft Corp. after his RISC work wascut.   Mr. Stone, Digital's software chief, concedes that theRISC redesign for the VAX line is indeed &quot;somewhat late,&quot; andthat Digital &quot;has been off the price-performance curve forquite some time.&quot; But he rejects criticism that Mr. Olsenmakes decisions in a vacuum. Mr. Stone says Mr. Olsendelegates authority in every area except engineering, wherehe takes a more hands-on approach. &quot;He allows, and evendemands, an intense level of debate and ferment below him,&quot;Mr. Stone says.</TEXT></DOC>
