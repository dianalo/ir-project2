Around that same time, Phillips was mourning the demise of herprevious group, Meat Joy, and longed to start another one. She andFreelove met and were soon playing guitar together at coffee houses.They performed Monkees songs, rock 'n' roll, old movie tunes as wellas their own material.   They called themselves Two Nice Girls.   A few months later, Freelove and Phillips met Kathy Korniloff andwere so pleased with how their voices and guitars sounded togetherthey decided to add her to the group.   The name? Two Nice Girls.   ``That was my idea,'' Phillips explained. ``It beat the hell ofout of The Jackson Five. Some friends of mine were in a band calledFive Happy Guys. One of them left so they changed the name to TheHappiness Crew. We were called Two Nice Girls and hired somebodyelse, but I didn't want to change the name.''   They are a major part of a lively Austin music scene that hasattracted the attention of critics around the country. All threeNice Girls, however, grew up elsewhere.   Phillips attended Houston's High School for the Performing Artsand headed to Austin after graduating.   ``My first song was a duet that I wrote for my sister and I,''she recalled. ``We would take baths together and it would takeforever. The song went, `102, oo oo oo . . 107, 111.' That was it.Then we would take the washcloth and suck the water out of it. I hadno idea what it was about.''   Freelove grew up in Alexandria, Va., and went to a Catholicgirls' high school outside of Rome.   ``I've been writing songs since I was this high,'' Freelove said.``I used to have to vacuum and clean the house and I used to make upsongs. I have tapes of almost everything I've done. I've got gobs oftapes of when I was a little guy. I was a much better songwriterwhen I was 13.''   Korniloff, the daughter of violinists, lived in The Netherlandsand Scarsdale, N.Y.   ``My first song was a very, very sad love song about a boy whowas supposed to my boyfriend who I caught with another girl. I wasso devastated. I went upstairs to the attic of my house with mylittle guitar and played my heart out.''   Their debut album, ``2 Nice Girls,'' features original songs fromall three and a unique overlapping of Lou Reed's ``Sweet Jane'' andJoan Armatrading's ``Love and Affection.'' The version on ``2 NiceGirls'' was a live performance on an Austin public radio station.   ``We went on for an hour-long program called `Live Set,'''Korniloff said. ``Our friends were all invited to be in the studioand lend that live clapping air to the show.   ``We tried a couple of times to record the song in the studio,but we could never recapture vocally what we did that one time. Asit turned out, the station still had the master copy on two-trackwhich they let us use. They said, `It's your performance; we onlyhave the tape.'''   The melodies and sweet harmonies make Two Nice Girls easy tolisten to, but ``My Heart Crawls Off,'' written by Phillips and SaraHickman, is a bitter song about jealousy.   ``That's the power of being a songwriter,'' Phillips said. ``Ijust wrote this horrible song about (President) Bush that's got areally lovely melody. If I just made another punk anthem called `IHate You,' it wouldn't be really effective.''   Freelove wrote ``Money,'' a long way from the Motown hit of thesame title that proclaimed, ``The best things in life are free, butyou can keep it for the bird and bees.'' Instead, Freelove warnsagainst being ``a slave to money.''   ``It's about money and obsession and the ways it numbs you out,''Freelove said. ``Money keeps many of us protected from distressingthings, disturbing things. People who have money can shieldthemselves from observing the homeless.''   Their sound recalls The Roches and Indigo Girls. But what couldhave influenced Phillips' ``I Spent my Last Ten Dollars (on BirthControl and Beer)'' or ``The Holland Song,'' in which Korniloffsings, ``The Dutch are too much''?   ``I don't really think of these songs as song of experience, butsongs of perspective,'' she said. ``I think that the content of thesongs are much more about how life ought to be. What we'd like forit to be like.   ``We consciously try to create a sense of community. It's morelikely to save us from horribly depressing lives. You have some sortof good feelings. Bands are at an advantage, they're capable ofdoing that.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Tues Aug. 29</NOTE></DOC>
