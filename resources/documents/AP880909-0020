KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Republicans say ``domestic politicalconsiderations'' are the driving force behind a move to passlegislation this year removing U.S. business investment from SouthAfrica and imposing a near-total trade embargo.   But Democrats pushing the economic sanctions bill as a means ofincreasing the cost of racial apartheid to Pretoria'swhite-dominated government say the issue is moral, not political.   The Reagan administration, which has long opposed sanctionsagainst South Africa, says imposing them now could underminedelicate talks in Brazzaville, the Congo, over the withdrawal ofCuban troops from Angola and independence for the territory ofSouth West Africa or Namibia, now under South African control.   ``The negotiations are in progress as we speak; they are in avery delicate stage,'' said Charles Freeman, assistant secretary ofstate for legislative affairs.   Freeman told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursdaythat action on the sanctions bill now ``would cause both sides _particulary South Africa and Cuba _ to harden their positions.''   At the State Department, spokesman Charles E. Redman, said: ``Weare strongly opposed to the wide-ranging and punitive sanctionsagainst South Africa contained in the legislation. We believe it'sfar more likely to encourage resistance to change in South Africathan promote a rapid end to apartheid.''   The foreign relations panel set a vote on the sanctions bill fornext Wednesday, leaving time for action on numerous amendmentswhich are expected to be offered by opponents of the measure.   As the committee opened its consideration of the bill, GOPopponents accused Democrats of trying to build a political issuethat can be used against Republican presidential candidate GeorgeBush in the fall campaign.   ``Domestic political implications are driving this,'' Sen. DanEvans, R-Wash., said of the proposal to end virtually all U.S.trade with and investment in South Africa. ``Domestic electionpolitics can do harm to foreign policy efforts.''   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., complained of Democrats ``makingmoral statements as the elections approach.''   ``It is an emotional issue coming shortly before the election,''he said. ``It is the political season, not deliberation, that ismoving this bill forward.''   The 1988 Democratic platform brands South Africa as a``terrorist state'' and Democratic presidential nominee MichaelDukakis has called for sterner sanctions.   Bush opposes sweeping sanctions, saying the United States mustremain ``engaged'' in South Africa to retain influence over eventsthere and to prevent communists from taking control.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a principal sponsor of the bill, whichis similar to the version passed by the House last month by a voteof 244-132, said his advocacy of it is not politically motivated.   ``There's a time bomb ticking away, and it's not going to stopticking because there's an American election,'' said Simon who justreturned from five days in South Africa.   Chances of the new sanctions bill becoming law are consideredslight in the month remaining before Congress is scheduled toadjourn for the year.   If the Senate were to pass the measure, the lack of strongRepublican backing for it likely would deny supporters the votesneeded to override an almost certain veto by President Reagan.   Backers of the sanctions bill said committee action would send astrong signal to South Africa that it must end apartheid and wouldnot threaten the Brazzaville talks. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,noted that the talks have made significant progress since the Housepassed its version of the sanctions bill.</TEXT></DOC>
