Analysts predicted the development would send a variety ofconsumer and business interest rates lower in coming weeks,including home mortgage rates and commercial banks' prime-lendingrate.   One analyst said a one-half percentage point reduction in theprime rate, the benchmark rate for many consumer loans, could comeas early as Monday. The prime rate stands at 11 percent.   ``The Fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we havepassed the peak on interest rates,'' said David Wyss, an economistwith DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting company in Lexington,Mass.   The Fed began easing its credit policy last month, changingcourse after a yearlong effort to drive rates higher as a way ofdampening inflationary pressures.   That credit squeeze had brought complaints from President Bushand others that the central bank ran the risk of pushing the countryinto a recession.   The central bank is trying to engineer a so-called``soft-landing'' for the economy in which growth slows enough todampen inflationary pressures but without a recession.   Economists based their belief that the Fed eased again this weekon a slight decline in the federal funds rate, which edged down 0.25percentage point to 9.25 percent Thursday and Friday.   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge eachother to make overnight loans. It is influenced by daily decisionsthe central bank makes on how much money to make available to thebanking system and is considered the best early warning signal ofFed intentions to loosen or tighten credit conditions.   The funds' rate dropped for the first time in a year in earlyJune, when it declined from 9.75 percent to 9.5 percent.   Many analysts said they expected to see further 0.25 percentagepoint declines over the next several months if inflation moderatesfurther and various business barometers continue signaling aslowdown.   The Labor Department reported Friday the nation's unemploymentrate climbed from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent in June, reflectingcontinuing job losses in manufacturing and construction.   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., agovernment securities dealer, said he expected the Fed'scredit-loosening moves would prompt banks to cut their prime-lendingrate to 10.5 percent, perhaps as early as Monday.   Other economists predicted that mortgage rates would soon dipback into the single-digit range, perhaps falling to as low as 9.5percent for fixed-rate mortgages. Such mortgages stand at 10.03percent, down from 10.07 percent the previous week, according to anational survey released Friday by the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp.   The latest easing came while Fed policy-makers were holding twodays of meetings as part of their midyear review of monetarystrategy.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will reveal details ofthis week's discussions when he delivers the Fed's midyearassessment of the economy in congressional testimony July 20.   At a May 16 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Fedpolicy-makers decided to leave credit conditions unchanged. However,they noted a variety of economic statistics pointing to slowergrowth, according to minutes of that meeting released Friday.   The FOMC is composed of members of the Federal Reserve Board inWashington and five of the 12 Fed regional bank presidents.</TEXT></DOC>
