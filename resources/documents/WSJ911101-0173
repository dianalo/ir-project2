By January, the Finance Ministry plans to present a draftlegislation that would create a federal regulatory agency,make insider trading illegal for the first time and imposeprison terms on violators. Market supervision would extendbeyond the stock exchange to other capital market activities,such as investment advisers and independent market makers.The German Parliament will be asked to write the changes intolaw by next July to comply with directives handed down by theEuropean Community Commission.</LP><TEXT>   When devising universal guidelines for European marketcontrols, the EC left national governments a certain latitudeon how these laws should be enforced. It wasn't clear whetherBonn would centralize regulatory powers into one agency, or amore decentralized system.   During a policy session among government and industryofficials in Bonn this week, Finance Ministry State SecretaryHorst Koehler announced the government's intention tocentralize supervision within a federal agency. This wouldtake regulatory authority away from state governments,although most in the past were regulators in name onlybecause of inadequate staffs, no powers of investigation andfew laws to enforce.   &quot;For the first time the Finance Ministry has spelled outthat it wants a federal agency to enforce these newregulations,&quot; said one German official who attended to thepolicy talks. &quot;The extent of regulations the ministry has inmind exceed the capabilities of the states.&quot;   The tougher legislation comes as the Frankfurt marketfaces its deepest crisis of confidence in decades. Stateprosecutors are investigating at least 200 brokers andbankers in connection with a widening insider-tradingscandal. Although most of the suspects are beinginvestigating for tax fraud, the probe has alerted investorsto broadly practised trading infractions by Frankfurt'strading community.   The investigation also has focused international attentionon Germany's lax regulatory controls, tarnishing Frankfurt'sreputation as a financial center at a time when the openingof Eastern Europe promised new business growth. EvenGermany's powerful banking community, which previously hadresisted tougher controls, now concedes the need for change.   Eberhard Martini, president of the German BankingAssociation, a leading industry lobby, earlier this weekacknowledged that Germany needed more effective marketcontrols to replace a system of self-regulation based on avoluntary honor code.   &quot;Trust in an orderly settlement of business has become animportant competitive factor&quot; among competing world stockexchanges, Mr. Martini said. &quot;But attention must be paid topreventing regulatory efforts from going overboard.&quot;   Government officials said many details for Germany's newregulator have yet to be settled. Unlike state governments,the new federal agency is likely to have independent powersof investigation.   It wasn't clear exactly how far the agency's investigativepowers would extend. The Finance Ministry also isn't surewhether the authority would be created as a separate entity,or as a new arm of the Banking Oversight Office.   Some bankers object to the creation of a German copy ofthe U.S. Securities andamp; Exchange Commission, claiming thatdaily monitoring of individual transactions could interferewith German banking laws. &quot;But it's possible that these lawsalso might have to be changed,&quot; said one person in thegovernment.   The draft legislation is likely to provide for prisonterms of up to two years and for violators of futurecontrols.   Otto Lambsdorff, chairman of the Free Democratic Party,the junior party in the government coalition, insisted thatthe new law bans all forms of inside trading, including thepractise of &quot;front-running.&quot; Reputed to be widely practicedin German markets, this typically occurs when informedbrokers run out their own buy order ahead of a major block ofcustomer orders for the same stock.   Speaking as president of the German Association for theProtection of Shareholders, an investors interest group, Mr.Lambsdorff also called for a law against ring schemes, inwhich a group of traders sell the same block of securitiesamong themselves to drive up the price. Trading on advanceknowledge of analysts' reports must be similarly banned, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
