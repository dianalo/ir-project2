Improved energy efficiency, achieved by introducing new cost-effectivetechnologies in industry, transportation, and buildings, can sharplycut the multibillion dollar annual energy bill for our economy, buy timeto diversify our long-term energy options, reduce dependence on energyimports with their balance-of-trade and security implications, and mitigatea number of environmental problems. Continued advances in energy-savingtechnology can play a key role in ensuring the competitiveness of USindustry in the world market not only by enhancing industrial productivity,but also by leading to the development of new highly valued productsfor US and international markets. Experience shows that well-conceivedfederal R and D can reinforce private industry initiatives. Conversely,a lack of federal support may open the way for aggressive firms overseas-oftenwith their own governments' backing-to gain the edge in both US and worldmarkets. The federal government has a vital role in carrying out energyconservation research, development, and technology transfer. Withoutactive federal participation, important technological advances wouldoften be hampered by industry fragmentation, market structure, or thenoncapturable (&quot;public good&quot;) nature of basic research. US industriesand consumers both benefit directly from energy conservation R and D,but if the federal government withdraws, the private sector cannot takeup all the slack. Federal energy conservation R and D has contributedsignificantly to the underlying policy objectives of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollingslegislation by reducing the need for investments in new energy productionsystems.</TEXT></DOC>
