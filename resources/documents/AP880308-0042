(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Washington state has filed suit in federalcourt to challenge a Navy claim that its civilian shipyardemployees are barred by the federal Hatch Act from participating intoday's presidential precinct caucuses.   U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner promised a ruling this morning.   The state's suit contends that prohibiting federal workers fromspeaking at their party caucuses unconstitutionally violates theirright to free speech, said David Bryant, a spokesman for theWashington secretary of state's office.   Bryant said the suit asks Tanner to clarify the intent of theHatch Act by interpreting ``conflicting sections'' of theregulations.   A bill to revise the Hatch Act and allow workers to participatein partisan political activities on their own time overwhelminglypassed the U.S. House of Representatives last year. It is stillpending in the Senate.   The Hatch Act regulates political activities of federal workers.   Officials at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton toldworkers recently they can attend the political caucuses scheduledin neighborhoods across Washington state tonight, but cannotdiscuss candidates.   In Washington, the precinct caucuses are the first step in themonths-long process leading up to a selection of delegates to thenational presidential nominating conventions this summer. At stakeultimately: 73 Democratic national convention delegates and 41 GOPdelegates.   The caucuses provide the only opportunity for most Washingtonvoters to express a preference for a presidential candidate.   ``Obviously, addressing the caucus is part of the activity,''said James Sommerhauser, representing Professional and TechnicalEngineers Local 12 in Bremerton, but ``most federal employees areso intimidated by the Hatch Act they're afraid to participate.''   Sommerhauser said his union represents 1,800 federal workers atthe yard and elsewhere in Kitsap County. The yard employs 11,600people.   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., whose district includes the shipyard,said over the weekend that the Navy's ``outrageous'' claim that itscivilian shipyard employees can't participate in the caucuses isone more good reason to change the Hatch Act.   Dicks commented after leaders of both major political partiessaid they thought the Navy order violated free speech guarantees.   Shipyard spokesman Bruce Andrae earlier defended the order onthe basis of the Hatch Act.   That law includes one provision allowing a government employeeto ``express his opinion as an individual privately and publicly onpolitical subjects and candidates.''   But another provision cited by the Navy forbids ``addressing aconvention, caucus, rally or similar gathering of a political partyin support of or in opposition to a partisan candidate for publicoffice.''   Yard workers learned of the issue when they read a Page 1article in the Feb. 25 edition of the base newspaper that said:``When the caucus discussion in favor of one candidate or anotheris held, you may not participate.''   Laura Baumgaertner, a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.,office of the Merit System Protection Board, which enforces thelaw, agreed the law bars government workers from speaking up atcaucuses.</TEXT></DOC>
