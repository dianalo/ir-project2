But in the junk bond market, prices ended moderately tosharply lower as investors worried about the prospects of arecession. Adding to the market's bearish tone, Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. reported that junk bond defaults arerunning at a 19-year high.</LP><TEXT>   In the Treasury market, the benchmark 30-year bond endedlittle changed. Shorter-term securities ended with modestdeclines. The latest two-year notes, for example, finishednearly 1/8 point lower, a loss of about $1.25 for a bond witha $1,000 face amount.   But trading activity in the Treasury market &quot;wasexceptionally light,&quot; said Charles Lieberman, a managingdirector at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.&quot;Basically, we are waiting for the Federal Open MarketCommittee meeting to see whether the Federal Reservesurprises us and eases monetary policy,&quot; he said.   The FOMC is the Fed's policy-making group, and its membersare scheduled to meet in Washington today to set monetarypolicy and assess the state of the economy. Prior to therecent rise in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion ofKuwait, it was widely expected that FOMC members would voteto reduce short-term interest rates in an effort to keep theeconomy from slipping into a recession.   But fearing that the oil price increases may stimulatebroad-based inflation, many economists now believe the Fedwill vote to keep credit policy unchanged.   The possibility that a policy change could occur kept manyinvestors away from the market.   Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service reported that 29issuers of junk bonds defaulted on interest payments in thefirst seven months of the year, representing a default rateof 5.8%. That rate was only marginally higher than the 5.6%default rate for all of 1989, but Moody's said that if thecurrent pace of defaults continues, 1990 will wind up withthe steepest corporate bond default rate since 1970, when thecollapse of Penn Central resulted in a 10.9% default rate.   Moody's said it expects the default rate to climb asheavily indebted companies encounter financial troublebrought about by a slowdown in consumer spending and thethreat of a recession spurred by oil prices.   In dollar terms, Moody's said roughly $8.4 billion of junkbonds defaulted during the first seven months for anannualized default rate of about 6.3% of total junk bondsoutstanding at the beginning of the year. By comparison, inall of 1989, $9.4 billion of debt defaulted, for adollar-based default rate of 4.9%.   The most significant defaults occurred in companiessensitive to trends in U.S. consumer spending, includingCampeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores and Allied Storesretailing units, which together accounted for 22% ofdefaulted debt so far this year. Other major defaultsaffected the debt of furniture and shoe conglomerate IntercoInc., convenience store operator Southland Corp., and WesternUnion Corp.   John Lonski, Moody's senior economist, said higher oilprices are likely to relieve pressure on junk bond issuersthat are suppliers or producers of oil products.   But for others, he said, costlier crude is likely to addto the already formidable challenges confronting steeplyleveraged companies by raising production costs, reducinghouseholds' purchasing power and by keeping interest rates,and thus refinancing costs, prohibitively high.   Another indication of rising credit problems is themounting level of credit rating downgrades within the junkbond market. Between January and July, Moody's said itdowngraded four junk bond issuers for each one it upgraded,including 52 rating downgrades to Caa, a total that isalready equal to Caa downgrades for all of 1989.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended slightly lower.   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 97 31/32, down from 98on Friday. The issue's yield, which moves in the oppositedirection from its price, was unchanged at 8.93%. The latesttwo-year note ended at 99 23/32, down from 99 26/32 onFriday. The yield rose to 8.14% from 8.08%.   The government sold a total of $18.4 billion ofthree-month and six-month Treasury bills at its regularweekly auction.   The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.55%,while the average rate on six-month bills was 7.45%. Thosewere up from last week's auction when they were 7.41% and7.31%, respectively.   Here are auction details:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                                      13-Week           26-Week                                                                                                          Applications .......... $21,205,580,000   $21,595,925,000   Accepted bids .........  $9,202,380,000    $9,202,960,000   Accepted at low price .             96%               66%   Accepted noncompet'ly .  $1,522,530,000    $1,297,225,000   Average price (Rate) ..  98.071 (7.55%)    96.234 (7.45%)   High price (Rate) .....  98.081 (7.51%)    96.249 (7.42%)   Low price (Rate) ......  98.068 (7.56%)    96.229 (7.46%)   Coupon equivalent .....           7.80%             7.85%                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Aug. 23. The 13-week bills matureNov. 23, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 21, 1991.                                                                                                          Corporate Issues                                                                                                          Junk bonds shrugged off gains in the stock market andsettled sharply lower as fears of recession and higherinflation continued to unsettle investors.   The junk bond market sometimes moves more closely with thestock market than other bond markets. But that wasn't thecase yesterday.   Prices of junk bonds, high-yield high-risk corporatesecurities that have low or no credit ratings, varied greatlyyesterday. Most top-quality junk issues ended between 3/8 and1/2 point lower, while middle and lower-tier issues sufferedeven greater losses, finishing one to 1 1/2 points lower.   Junk bond investors said recession-prone bonds such as USGCorp. and American Standard Inc. were particularly hard hit.American Standard's 12.875% senior subordinated debenturesmaturing in 2000 plunged three points to 90, while USG's13.25% senior subordinated debentures due in 2000 tumbled twopoints to close at 53.   By contrast, non-cyclical bonds such as issues fromsupermarkets, food companies and other industries fared muchbetter. Among the market's stronger performers were KrogerCo.'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in1999, which finished unchanged at 101 1/4.   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-gradecorporate bonds ended little changed.   Meanwhile, PaineWebber Inc. said its private placementgroup has received commitments for $100 million of 11.43%senior notes due 1995 to be issued by Petroleos Mexicanos,the Mexican national oil company.   PaineWebber said the notes are priced at par and yieldthree percentage points above the yield on five-year Treasurynotes. PaineWebber said it expects the transaction to closein late September.   The securities firm said the placement represents Pemex'sfirst entry into the U.S. private placement market since 1982and follows offerings for Pemex in West Germany and Austriaearlier this year.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          Citicorp's $1.4 billion global credit-card backedsecurities offering was the main focus of the Eurobondmarket.   The issue was split into two parts. The public, registeredportion consisting of $1.25 billion of three-year notes had a8 7/8% coupon and was priced at 99.91 to yield 8.912%. The$155 million of subordinated credit-card notes was privatelyplaced. The three-year notes had a coupon of 9 1/8% and werepriced at 99.855 to yield 9.182%.   A Citicorp official described the issue, which was thebanking company's third such offering, as a &quot;crisp, cleantransaction in a very difficult environment.&quot;   Traders said buyers were almost exclusively U.S.institutions. European investors didn't buy large quantitiesof the bonds, despite intensive marketing efforts. This waspartly because of worries about how the dollar will fare ifthe Middle East crisis worsens. &quot;The pricing seems fair; it'sjust the timing that isn't great,&quot; said a syndicate managerat a European bank.   Meanwhile, prices of most global government bondscontinued to tumble, and interest rates rose on concern aboutevents in the Persian Gulf.   Hardest hit among the major markets was France, whereprices fell nearly one point. Among benchmark Frenchgovernment bonds, the 8.5% issue due 2019 fell 0.93 pointfrom late Friday in Paris to 82.00 to yield 10.49%.   British and West German government bonds ended moderatelylower.   But in Japan, prices of most government bonds firmed afterthe Finance Ministry supported the market by purchasing 90billion yen ($614.6 million) of government bonds. Still, theyield on the benchmark No. 119 bond remained above 8%.   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the No. 119 bondwas priced to yield 8.03%. The yield was as high as 8.10%before the Finance Ministry purchases.                                                                                                          Municipals                                                                                                          Municipal bonds moved off lows and ended unchanged to 1/8point lower.   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's7.20% issue of 2018 was 1/8 lower at 97 7/8 bid to yield7.36%.                                                                                                          Mortgage-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices closely reflected the Treasury market's activity.   Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securitiesfor September delivery were off 1/32 at 98 15/32; FederalHome Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2% securities were down 3/32 at98; and Federal National Mortgage Association 9 1/2%securities were 3/32 lower at 98 17/32.</TEXT></DOC>
