In addition,workers laid bricks near the science building, painted the gym and placed ninebenches throughout the South San Jose campus.;    The efforts were sponsoredby the Sterling Community Service Foundation, an Oakland-based volunteer groupthat plans neighborhood service projects. Santa Teresa, which is in the EastSide Union High School District, joined 13 schools in the United States andCanada that participated in Sterling's International Community Service Day onMay 4 and 5.;    &quot;We want the community to believe they'll make a differenceif everyone works together for a common goal,&quot; said John Kimura, a Sterlingvolunteer and a teacher at the Boys Ranch in Morgan Hill.;    In particular,the volleyball courts exemplified teamwork. Students and teachers dominatedthe rows of volunteers at the sand site. To distribute 150 tons of sand, linesof workers emptied wheelbarrows filled with the fine grains. Then volunteersscooped and leveled the sand for the courts. Everyone laughed at the samejokes, regardless of age and occupation.;    Electricians and carpenters alsolent a hand, primarily with the press box and snack shack.;    Along withphysical labor, volunteers prepared and served breakfast and lunch. The foodand drinks were donated by local businesses. Other helpers baby-sat workers'children in the school's child care center. To combat the sun, volunteersbrought the laborers thermoses filled with ice water along with tubes ofsunscreen.;    &quot;I feel euphoric,&quot; said Mike Welch, school principal. &quot;Seeingeveryone working together is a renewal of community spirit. Everyone issweating side by side.&quot;;    Santa Teresa became involved with Sterling after afriend told Welch about the foundation. Welch said faculty and students wereleery at first that the improvements could be built by volunteers. Theboosters club had estimated the projects would cost $150,000 if done byprivate contractors.;    However, starting in February, a 10-member committeeof Sterling volunteers and high school representatives met every Sunday nightto plan the project. During the week, administrators and students talked aboutthe project at school. The organizing group swelled to 40 members by April.The necessary $20,000 for materials was generated by fund-raising events.;   The senior class adopted the snack shack as their school gift. The 400-memberclass couldn't afford a present, so students decided to donate their labor.The majority of student volunteers were seniors.;    &quot;Our class is kind ofdead, so I'm shocked to see so many seniors here,&quot; said Tram Nguyen, a seniorand student body president. &quot;We have spirit competitions between the classes.If seniors participate, it's because we're competing with other classes. Ifthey're here today, it's because they want to be here and not because theywant to beat another class.&quot;;    In contrast to donated labor, students fromthe Milpitas Electrolysis and Massage College donated free 15-minute massagesto ease volunteers' tense muscles.;    &quot;We're here to support the communityand to give students experience massaging all kinds of bodies,&quot; said GilbertArchibeque, college owner.;    A makeshift massage area with three tables wasset up in the gym. The five future masseuses soothed a steady stream of sorenecks, backs and shoulders. &quot;We saw a lot of really tight bodies,&quot; Archibequesaid.;    The tight muscles bore evidence of the volunteers' weekend efforts.All the buildings were completed by Sunday evening, Welch said. &quot;A lot ofpeople said the projects wouldn't really happen because we wouldn't haveenough help,&quot; he said.;    &quot;They were wrong. If people share a common goal,then accomplishing that goal is possible by determination and fortitude.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KIM BERGHEIM, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910515  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  822  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 15, 199100136322,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
