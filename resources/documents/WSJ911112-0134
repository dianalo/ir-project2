The television maker described the move as strictly aconsolidation effort. Late last month, Zenith announced plansto shift its remaining domestic TV-assembly operations to twoMexican cities on the U.S. border.</LP><TEXT>   With negotiations over a proposed free-trade pact betweenthe U.S. and Mexico continuing on track, Zenith may prove tobe one of the first of a number of U.S. companies to transferassembly jobs from Asia to Mexico.   &quot;There's not a mass exodus coming from Taiwan, but Zenithis probably a pretty good indication of where things areheaded in the future,&quot; said Don Nibbe, publisher of TwinPlant News, an El Paso, Texas, trade publication for theborder-plant industry.   As wages rise in the increasingly prosperous economies ofHong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, manufacturershave in recent years opted to move some production to othersites in Asia, such as Malaysia, where compensation isrelatively lower.   While the company denied any relationship, Zenith's moveto Mexico suggests that the perceived benefits of thepossible free-trade pact, combined with other factors, mightbe tipping the balance for some U.S. manufacturers.   &quot;I've been expecting this to happen,&quot; said SidneyWeintraub, Dean Rusk Professor at the Lyndon B. JohnsonSchool of Public Affairs, University of Texas, Austin, whenapprised of Zenith's announcement. &quot;In part it's wages,&quot; theeconomist said, but &quot;in part it's also free trade.&quot;   Manufacturers, even those based in the U.S., must pay dutyfees on goods manufactured abroad, but a free-trade pactwould allow goods manufactured in Mexico to enter the U.S.and Canada without such penalties.   &quot;The quality of Mexican manufacturing has been increasingover the past few years,&quot; says Joe Blackburn, a professor ofoperations management at Vanderbilt University. As the &quot;gapbetween the quality that {manufacturers} were able to achievein Far Eastern plants and what they're able to achieve inMexico now&quot; narrows, he says, &quot;Mexican plants look a lot moreattractive.&quot; For U.S. companies, there are also time benefitsin terms of scheduling production and moving goods back andforth, he says.   The proposed free-trade pact has drawn fire from U.S.labor groups and environmentalists, who have contended thatU.S. production jobs would be lost to low-paying Mexicofactories, and that softer pollution-control requirementswould lead to environmental damage.   Zenith said the restructuring of its Zenith Taiwan unit,which makes monochrome computer monitors, will begin inApril. Under the plan, it will &quot;shift from manufacturing topurchasing operations,&quot; with the Asian company buying picturetubes and other components and shipping them to Mexico forassembly into finished TVs.   A spokesman said that while Zenith supports the free-tradepact, the possible agreement &quot;isn't an issue,&quot; and that themove from Taiwan is one &quot;simply of reducing our costs andimproving our efficiencies.&quot; He conceded that wages in Mexicoare lower than those in Taiwan, but declined to discussspecific wage levels.   The Taiwan computer-screen assembly operation will beconsolidated with those in Reynosa, Mexico, where Zenithassembles high-resolution color monitors made with tubesmanufactured in the Chicago area. Charges associated with themove will be covered by earlier reserves, a spokesman said.   &quot;I think {Asia-to-Mexico transfers} like this will happenmore and more frequently,&quot; said Douglas A. Campbell, head ofD.A. Campbell Co., an investment banking firm specializing inLatin American companies. Even exclusive of the free-tradepact, he said, the basic reasons for the growth are &quot;wagesand transportation.&quot;   ---   Matt Moffett in Mexico City contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
