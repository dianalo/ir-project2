STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An East German opposition figure said people havebeen too quick to condemn the country's new leader and he urgedcitizens to give the reputed hard-liner a chance to institutereforms, a newspaper said today.   On his first full day as head of the country, Egon Krenz onThursday chatted with factory workers in East Berlin and portrayedhimself as open to dialogue and change.   Krenz also met with a church leader and opened the way for a newlaw regulating foreign travel.   The image of the active leader engaged in frank discussion withworkers contrasted sharply with the stiff, reclusive manner ofErich Honecker, who was removed Wednesday after 18 years in power.   Opposition groups say the new Communist Party chief's politicsdiffer little from those of his autocratic predecessor.   More than 10,000 people demanding change rallied in the city ofZittau, in southeastern East Germany, on Thursday night, saidactivists from the New Forum pro-democracy group.   But Rolf Henrich, a New Forum member, was quoted today as sayingKrenz should be given time to change people's minds.   ``It doesn't make sense to deny him a chance from the verystart,'' Henrich was quoted as saying in the West German newspaperBadische Zeitung.   He said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was also once asupporter of the ``party apparatus.''   ``And look how excited we all are about what's he doing now,''Henrich said.   Krenz, 52, faces the most serious threat to orthodox Communistrule in East Germany's 40-year history, as tens of thousands fleeto the West and thousands of others who do not wish to leaveagitate for a more open society.   He already has said the party will resist the democratic reformsunder way in Poland and Hungary.   Nonetheless, West Germany's ARD television network said hismeeting with factory workers would have been ``unthinkable only afew weeks ago.''   The broadly publicized meetings appeared aimed at showing thecountry's 16.5 million people that Krenz will deliver on his pledgeto address East Germany's problems as long as the party's leadingrole remains intact.   When asked by Krenz why so many co-workers fled to West Germany,metal worker Ronald Berus said, ``A lot of things kept adding upuntil some people felt there was no alternative.''   ``Until last week, you couldn't talk about problems, and peoplejust got fed up,'' he said.   Several workers complained of rigid travel restrictions to theWest, which were recently expanded to bar travel to Czechoslovakia,Poland and Hungary without government permission. Thousands of EastGermans have made their way to the West through those countries inrecent weeks.   In one of his first official acts in office, Krenz said thegovernment is drafting a new law that could ultimately ease travelabroad. He said West Germany's refusal to recognize East Germancitizenship is an obstacle. Bonn grants East Germans automaticcitizenship.   Wolfgang Lueder, a member of West German Chancellor HelmutKohl's ruling coalition, today was quoted as saying Bonn could helpexpand travel by allowing East Germans to change money for WestGerman marks. East German currency is not convertible.   Lueder was quoted in an interview with Cologne's Expressnewspaper as saying the move would be a ``subsidized exchange.'' Hesuggested Bonn could use the new East German marks to buy moregoods from East Germany.   In addition to talking with factory workers, Krenz on Thursdaymet with Werner Leich, head of the East German Lutheran ChurchFederation, for talks described by East German television as ``openand constructive.'' The church has been at the forefront of reformefforts.   Krenz said in his first national address as party leader that hehas no intention of sharing power with opposition groups.Nevertheless, New Forum activists said Thursday that localCommunist Party officials in Potsdam offered to open limited talkswith them.</TEXT></DOC>
