Most current applications for using highgrade heat are for water heating, and in some cases low grade heat isalso used for ice arena heating. In this project, it is proposed to usehigh grade waste heat from an ice rink in Okotoks, Alberta to heat aswimming pool currently heated by natural gas. The facility in whichthe project is located has three rinks, swimming pool and whirlpool,and the refrigeration plant uses two compressors. An energy audit wascompleted to show waste heat production and pool heating requirements,and two conceptual designs for utilizing the waste heat are presented.Potential cost savings over natural gas heating are estimated at $5,426/y.The project cost estimate is $29,488 implying a simple payback periodof 5.4 years. This can be reduced further in the piping and instrumentationareas in this and other commercial projects of a similar nature. Completiondate for the project is estimated as June 1987. 10 refs., 3 figs., 5tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
