In a report that cited no sources, the weekly Ash-Shiraa saidthe U.S. release of Iranian assets this week while Iran's foreignminister was in Algiers indicated the matter was getting moreattention.   ``It is known that the issue of foreign hostages in Lebanon hasbeen put on the front burner and developments could come upconcerning the release of some of the hostages very soon,'' themagazine said in a two-paragraph story.   It has made similar predictions regularly since November 1987,when it broke the story of the arms-for-hostages deal between theUnited States and Iran. None of its recent hostage reports havebeen accurate.   Eight of the Western hostages in Lebanon are Americans,including the one held longest: Terry A. Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16,1985.   Iran repeated on Friday that the U.S. release this week of $567million in frozen Iranian assets would not affect the status of theAmerican hostages, most of whom are held by Shiite Moslemkidnappers loyal to Iran.   Tehran television quoted Eftekhar Jahroomi, legal adviser toPresident Hashemi Rafsanjani, as saying the U.S. action Mondaymerely complied with a decision of the U.S.-Iranian claimscommission set up in 1981 after talks in Algiers.   ``The payment was solely in line with the Algiers agreements,''Jahroomi said. ``Iran's claims against American banks weresimilarly paid.''   Algeria was the main mediator in negotiations that led to therelease in January 1981 of 52 Americans held hostage 444 days atthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency had said thepurpose of Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati's 3-day trip toAlgeria was to discuss relations between the two countries.   President Bush said Tuesday he hoped return of the assets wouldencourage Iran to seek release of the hostages, but U.S. officialsalso insisted the transfer was not related to the hostage issue.   Rafsanjani, leader of the ``pragmatists'' who seek to end Iran'sisolation, told a news conference last month he would help securefreedom for the hostages if the United States released all Iranianassets frozen after the embassy was stormed in 1979.   Iran says the assets now are worth $12 billion, including thevalue of weapons purchased by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlevi,who was overthrown by the Islamic revolution in February 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
