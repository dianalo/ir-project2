For the previous two weeks, the administration had noted withalarm Sandinista preparations for an offensive in the heavilyjungled Bocay Valley in northern Nicaragua. They had begun withindays after the Feb. 29 cutoff of U.S. aid to the Contras.   The administration kept quiet about the Sandinista activitiesuntil Tuesday, when State Department spokesman Charles Redman saidthe preparations foreshadowed ``the largest offensive we have seenthe Sandinistas undertake.''   Later in the day, two Pentagon officials who briefed reportersat the State Department seemed to undercut Redman somewhat by beingless categorical than the spokesman about Sandinista intentions.   But those discrepencies were quickly forgetten when, soon afterthe briefing ended, initial reports that the offensive had startedbegan to reach Washington. As outlined by Secretary of State GeorgeP. Shultz and other senior administration officials who asked notto be named, the ensuing period was one of intense activity as thegovernment decided on an appropriate response.   The magnitude of the attack surprised officials. Severalthousand Sandinista troops attacked Contra positions on theNicaraguan side of the border and upwards of 1,500 troopspenetrated Honduran territory. They also pounded Contra positionswith heavy artillery and aeriel bombardment.   One apparent aim was the destruction of a Contra military supplydepot which the rebels consider vital to their survival. Anotherwas to enhance the Sandinista bargaining position for cease-firetalks with the Contras that are scheduled to begin Monday in asouthern Nicaraguan town.   On Capitol Hill, there were expressions of skepticism byDemocrats about the early reports. Some felt that theadministration claims were too self-serving to be taken at facevalue.   After all, the administration had been trying for weeks tofashion a strategy for winning congressional approval for more aidto the Contras.   Hours after the initial reports of the offensive had beenreceived in Washington, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortegaconfirmed them. But he made no reference to a Sandinista bordercrossing into Honduras.   By Wednesday morning, about 18 hours after the first reports ofthe Sandinista penetration, the U.S. ambassador to Honduras,Everett Briggs, met with President Jose Azcona and discussed thepossibility of U.S. assistance to Honduras.   Azcona consulted by telephone with the presidents of Guatemala,El Salvador and Costa Rica to tell them of his concerns. He alsocalled Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to demand the withdrawalof the Sandinista forces.   By early afternoon, a Nicaraguan military spokeswoman deniedthan an ``invasion'' of Honduras had taken place. At mid-afternoon,Ortega went on national radio to say that there had been ``crossfire from Honduran territory against our forces.''   He neither confirmed nor denied the presence of Nicaraguansoldiers in Honduras. But House speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., saidNicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto had confirmed bytelephone the border crossing but that the Sandinista forces wereretreating back into Nicaragua.   In late afternoon, Honduran Air Force pilots flew over the areaand reported the Sandinista troop concentrations back to Azcona. At5 p.m., Azcona met again with Briggs and handed him a letter askingfor U.S. ground troops.   Briggs later relayed the request to Assistant Secretary of StateElliott Abrams, who passed it on to National Security adviser ColinPowell.   Powell and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker briefedReagan at his residence at 8 p.m., and the president then decidedto comply with the request.   The White House made the formal announcement at 10 p.m.Wednesday, emphasizing that the 3,200 troops to be sent to Honduraswould be deployed far from the scene of hostilities and would notengage in combat.   Nine hours later, about 2,000 troops from the 82nd AirborneDivision departed Fort Bragg, N.C., on the three-hour flight toPalmerola Air base in Honduras, about 125 miles from the borderarea.   By 11 a.m., two battalions from the 7th Infantry Division atFort Ord, Calif., began heading for the same destination.   The deployment was aimed, Shultz said, at telling the Hondurans:``We are your friends. We stand with you.''</TEXT></DOC>
