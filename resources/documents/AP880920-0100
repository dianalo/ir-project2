The Michigan attorney general's office and the American CivilLiberties Union agreed that surrogate arrangements are illegal if amother is paid to give up her parental rights. That agreementenabled Wayne County Circuit Judge John Gillis to rule Monday onthe law's constitutionality without listening to lengthy arguments.   It's possible Gillis could distinguish between a payment forgiving up parental rights and a payment for the service of bearinga child. Gillis promised to issue a further ruling within 30 to 60days.   The ACLU believes the judge will interpret the law to mean it isOK to pay a woman for the service of carrying a child, so long asshe wasn't paid to give up custody.   If the judge agrees, a woman who was artificially inseminatedcould keep the money and the baby, and the man whose sperm was usedin the insemination would have to fight for custody of the child.   After court, Gillis confirmed that is the focus of the decisionstill before him.   National Coalition Against Surrogacy Co-chair Jeremy Rifkincalled Monday's action a major victory because Gillis was the firstjudge to rule on the constitutionality of criminal sanctions forsurrogacy.   ``That is crucial to us because we are in the process of movinglegislation in legislatures across the country,'' he said fromWashington.   Noel Keane, a Dearborn attorney, is one of the nation's mostprolific surrogacy specialists, claiming responsibility for 245births, including New Jersey's ``Baby M.''   Keane expressed confidence the contracts he has been arrangingwill be found to be legal.   He typically makes $10,000 for arranging a birth. Women whoagree to be artificially inseminated and then let the biologicalfather raise the offspring earn the same amount. The infertilecouple pays the medical costs.   The new law, which took effect Sept. 1, calls for up to fiveyears in prison and a $50,000 fine for brokers who make money byarranging surrogate births. Advertising or ``inducing'' a woman tobear a child for an infertile couple also became a felony.   Under the law, women who enter into surrogacy contractsinvolving an exchange of money risk misdemeanor penalties of 90days in jail and a $10,000 fine.   The law didn't penalize arrangements involving no exchange ofmoney, but the ACLU argued in a suit on behalf of surrogates andwould-be parents that removing the payment for a woman's serviceseffectively abolished surrogacy.   Michigan was the first state to approve criminal penalties forsurrogate parent contracts.   Kentucky and Louisiana have enacted laws declaring suchcontracts illegal but don't impose criminal penalties. Nebraskadoesn't recognize as legal surrogacy contracts, and Indiana hasbarred enforcement of surrogate parenting contracts. A Florida lawcriminalizing contracts and setting up regulations was passed afterMichigan's, but took effect July 1. Nevada has legalized surrogacy.</TEXT></DOC>
