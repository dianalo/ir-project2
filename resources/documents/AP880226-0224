A 47-year-old former Secret Service officer who once protectedJackie Kennedy, Tucker is revamping a department that less than ayear ago was labeled ``unfocused, unmanaged, undertrained,underequipped and unaccountable.''   As head of the nation's fourth largest force, Tucker is creditedwith restoring morale and public confidence in a departmentcrippled by a federal corruption probe and a deadly confrontationwith the radical group MOVE.   A 1986 survey revealed that 65 percent of Philadelphians thoughtpolice officers used excessive force, 49 percent thought they tookbribes and 46 percent believed they slept on the job.   ``I don't represent corrupt or brutal police officers,'' Tuckersaid in an interview. ``It's my responsibility to find them and todeal with them as effectively as possible and to get rid of them.''   Since 1983, a federal investigation of police corruption hasresulted in the conviction of 34 police officers, including adeputy commissioner, for extorting money from vice figures.   The department came under searing criticism for its handling ofthe May 1985 confrontation with the radical group MOVE in which 11people died and 61 rowhouses were destroyed in a fire ignited by apolice bomb.   In January 1986, Tucker replaced Gregore Sambor, who quit afterthe MOVE debacle. One of Tucker's first actions was to appoint acivilian task force to examine the department top to bottom.   The group issued a 195-page report last May attacking theforce's management, training, infrastructure and relationship withthe city's 1.6 million residents.   ``To us, the Philadelphia Police Department's development as aneffective, modern department seems arrested,'' the 13-member panelwrote. ``The dead hand of past traditions guides the department,rather than the challenge of the future.''   So far, over half the task force's 112 recommendations have beenimplemented, and Tucker gets credit.   ``He has communicated a clear, positive, modern image of what ametropolitan police department ought to be,'' said William B.Eagleson Jr., chairman of the civilian Police CommissionersCouncil. ``He's a very strong leader.''   Among the few major gripes, black officers charge Tucker withfailing to recruit and promote enough minorities, who comprise just18 percent of the force in a city that is 42 percent black andHispanic.   Philadelphia has the lowest crime rate among the nation's top 10cities and is tied with Detroit for the highest number of officersper capita.   Still, in 1974, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission said of thePhiladelphia police: ``corruption and political influence haveplagued the force since its inception.''   The force's reputation for violence grew under Frank Rizzo, whowas commissioner from 1967 to '71 and mayor from 1972 to '80. Onestudy found that from 1975 to '78, 41 percent of people shot bypolice were unarmed.   The last decade has included unconstitutional police ``sweeps,''dozens of false arrest charges and accusations of abuses by thepolice K-9 unit. According to city records, more than 300 citizenswere attacked by police dogs in the early 1980s.   Tucker quickly reorganized the department's ethics andaccountability division, which helped arrest nine officers oncorruption charges in 1986. And for the first time ever, thedepartment now has a statement of ethical principles.   ``There's no question that he was very serious about makingchanges in the way the police department handled matters involvingthe integrity of officers,'' said U.S. Attorney Edward S.G. DennisJr.   Tucker was a police officer for two years in Rahway, N.J.,before joining the Secret Service in 1965. He spent four yearstraveling around the world providing security for John F. Kennedy'swidow, Jacqueline Kennedy, and the couple's two children.   From 1969 to '78, Tucker was an agent in Newark, N.J.,Philadelphia and Washington before taking over the Philadelphiaoffice. He retired from the Secret Service in May 1985.   After six months in the private sector, he accepted thecommissioner's job at a salary of $55,000 a year _ a $20,000 paycut. In January, Tucker received a pay raise to $85,000.   The first outsider named police commissioner since 1924, Tuckerwas greeted coolly by some members of the force _ including theinfluential head of the police union _ but reform has wooed thecritics.   ``I think there isn't any doubt that this police force isresponding to what is happening at the top,'' said MichaelChurchill, chief counsel for the Public Interest Law Center. ``Manypeople in the force were disgusted by the crooks and the morebrutal members and are pleased it's not being condoned.''   Tucker sees policing as a partnership between officers and thepublic; so, he's opened a minipolice station in one of the city'sworst drug neighborhoods and added victim assistance and crimeprevention officers.   Foot patrols have been increased, officers are learning Spanish,computers are on order and Nautilus exercising machines have beeninstalled in police divisions.   ``I was convinced from my time here as head of the SecretService that there were a lot of dedicated and competent people,''said Tucker, a burly 6-footer with a Brooklyn accent. ``It was aquestion of giving them the opportunity to be innovative andcreative.''   Tucker's tenure as head of the 6,700-member force hasn't beenentirely smooth.   A federal lawsuit by the Fraternal Order of Police has stymiedhis attempt to require polygraph tests for officers seeking to joinan elite investigation team.   Last year, the commissioner was criticized for allowing officersto ``infiltrate'' political groups police believed would disruptevents celebrating the bicentennial of the Constitution.   The Guardian Civic League, which represents black officers, hascalled for timetables for increasing the number of blacksupervisors.   ``I still see more effort in the hardware rather than in dealingwith some core problems,'' said Detective Ron Oliver, the league'spresident.   Tucker said he still has much to accomplish, from modernizingfacilities to upgrading officer performance standards.   ``I'm satisfied we've come a long way,'' he said. ``But a lotremains to be done, and a lot of them are big-ticket items.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Feb. 29</NOTE></DOC>
