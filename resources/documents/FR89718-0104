Justification. </ITAG>1. <T3>Need for Reinstatement.</T3> The HDG Application Packet and ApplicationForm (HUD 90031) were reinstated in FY 1986 and extended through September30, 1987. The HUD Form 90031 was once again reinstated to expire October30, 1991, in order to accommodate updates for existing grantees. Sincethat time HUD has decided to reuse accumulated recaptured funds througha funding round. This funding round will be held in the summer of 1989and will utilize the HUD Application Packet as approved in 1987. Therefore,the Packet must be reinstated immediately. 2. <T3>Necessity of Information.</T3> The information is necessary to continueimplementation of the Housing Development Grant Program in Title III, Section301 of the HURRA legislation. The statute requires a competitive selection(based upon certain factors and limitations) of applications containingspecified material. The application packet provides guidance to applicantsinterested in preparing an application which contains the required materialso that it can be competitively ranked against other applications underall the appropriate criteria. The applications submitted will be evaluatedby the Department to determine initial compliance with program requirementsand will be ranked competitively. The highest ranked proposals will beawarded funds under the program. 3. <T3>Information Technology.</T3> Improved information technology is notapplicable to the collection of application data. The requirements of thestatute and regulations preclude reducing the burden below the level requiredby the application. 4. <T3>Duplication.</T3> We have made every effort to design the applicationto avoid duplication of data. For example, when two separate statutoryor regulatory provisions have requested data on similar items, these itemshave been combined in the application to avoid repeating contextual material.The material requested does not duplicate material otherwise availableto the Department except in the case of Census material which the applicantmust also be aware of and may wish to alter with local data, and the FormHUD-92264 (submitted only in HUD insured cases) which is not availablein HUD Headquarters where much of the application review is accomplished.5. <T3>Alternative Data.</T3> There is no substitute for the application requiredby the program. Each application must contain information required by thespecific statute and project specific data not otherwise available. 6. <T3>Small Business.</T3> The application is submitted by a State or unitof general local government, no small businesses are burdened by the applicationrequirements. 7. <T3>Frequency.</T3> Applications will be submitted only once for each fundingcycle. Frequency cannot be reduced. 8. <T3>5 CFR 1320.6.</T3> We are aware of no inconsistencies. 9. <T3>Outside consultation.</T3> The HDG program has been through four fundingcycles. In our dealings with local and State government officials and fromfirst hand, in house experience, we have provided clarifications for severalParts in the Packet and have been more specific about what constitute firmfinancial commitments. 10. <T3>Confidentiality.</T3> No assurances of confidentiality can be given.Personal financial statements received as a part of any application, however,will be maintained as confidential in the same manner as those receivedin HUD insurance cases. The project close out documents will contain no sensitive materials. 11. <T3>Sensitive Materials.</T3> The application will contain no sensitivematerial. 12(a). <T3>Cost to Federal Government_Application Packet</T3> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Invitation for Applications<D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Review Hours per Application<D>+100</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total Hours per Application<D>101 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of Applications<D>andmultiply;54</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Hours<D>5,454 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost per Hour<D>$19.45 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Overhead Percentage<D>20% </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total cost per Hour<D>$23.33 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hours times Cost<D>5,454andmultiply;$23.33</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Cost<D> $127,241.82</D></ITAG></ITAG> 12(a). <T3>Cost to Federal Government_Forms HUD-90031 and 90031-A</T3> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Number of Applications<D>200</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Review Hours per Application<D>andmultiply;4</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>800 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost per Hour<D>$10.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hours times Cost<D>800andmultiply;$10.00</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost<D>$8,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Cost<D>$135,241.82</D></ITAG></ITAG> 12(b). <T3>Estimated Annual Cost to Respondents_Application Packet</T3> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Number of Applications<D>54 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hours per Application<D>82</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total Hours<D>4,428 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost per Hour<D>$20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Overhead Percentage<D>20% </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total Cost per Hour<D>$24 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hours times Cost<D>4,428andmultiply;$24</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Cost<D>$106,272</D></ITAG></ITAG> 12(b). <T3>Estimated Cost to Respondents_Forms HUD-90031 and 90031-A</T3> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Number of Applications<D>200</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hours per Application<D>andmultiply;4</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>800 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Total cost per Hour<D>$6.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hours times Cost<D>800andmultiply;$6.00</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Cost<D>$4,800</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Cost<D>$111,072</D></ITAG></ITAG> 13. <T3>Application Packet Burden.</T3> Following is the best estimate in termsof hours for completing each Part of the application: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s13,7,6,6</C>  <H1>Part</H1><H1>Applicants</H1><H1>Owner</H1><H1>Total</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">A<D>2</D><D>0</D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B<D>4</D><D>0</D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C<D>5</D><D>5</D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D<D>2</D><D>0</D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">E<D>4</D><D>0</D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F<D>3</D><D>0</D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">G<D>4</D><D>0</D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">H<D>8</D><D>0</D><D>8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I<D>3</D><D>3</D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">J<D>5</D><D>0</D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K<D>2</D><D>2</D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">L<D>3</D><D>0</D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">M<D>5</D><D>32</D><D>37</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total Burden</ITAG><D/><D/><D>82</D></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="15">82 Hours Per Application </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">54 Applications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4,428 Total Burden Hours </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Application Forms 90031 and 90031-A </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4 Hours per Application </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">200 Applications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">800 Total Burden Hours </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total Application and Forms_5,228 Hours </ITAG>14. <T3>Reason for change in Burden Hours.</T3> N/A.

Additional Assistance to Lower Income or Very Low-Income TenantsPoints will be assigned (Selection Factor F.2.) to applications proposingadditional assistance through a subsidy mechanism which: (a) assists tenants with incomes below 50% of median (very low-income)to pay no more than 30% of their income for rent and utilities. (The relevantcomparison is the percentage of very low-income units to total units withthe higher percentage receiving more points.)<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> When such assistance is provided in order to comply withthe relocation requirements of Part I of this packet, no points will beassigned.</ITAG>(b) assists the project so that the market rate units have rent levelswhich are within the Section 8 Existing Fair Market Rents (FMR) (The relevantcomparison is the percentage of market rate units within the FMRs to thetotal with the higher percentage receiving more points.) (c) extends the period of assistance for all of the lower income unitsto 25 or more years.

Neighborhood Development This represents a significant change in the relative emphasis on NeighborhoodDevelopment as necessary to improve the program's response to the one ofthe Departmental priorities, i.e., economic development. The goal is givegreater advantage to those projects which will significantly enhance theeconomic base of the neighborhood in which it is located. There are two considerations to be taken into account when responding tothis Part. A. The applicant should describe the physical, social and economic effectsof the project on the neighborhood. If HUD determines that the projectwill have a negative effect on the neighborhood, the project may be rejectedbased on Threshold 12. Typical considerations in determining the neighborhood effect include:compatibility with existing land uses, increased demand on traffic andother environmental burdens, complementary effects on employment patterns,and/or the likely effect of the project on recent changes in neighborhoodcharacter and investment patterns. HUD will view any unmitigated displacement resulting from such an effectas negative. B. The effect on the neighborhood will be evaluated to determine pointsto be assigned under Selection Factor C. The applicant should provide theNeighborhood Identification and Description required under Part H-1 ifit intends to receive points under this factor. (This description can alsobe used by HUD to make determinations under A above.) There are three criteriafor awarding a maximum of eight (8) points. 1. Projects that ``anchor'' a neighborhood. It must be clearly demonstratedthat the neighborhood where the project is to be located is undergoingsevere physical, social or economic decline and that the proposal willhelp alleviate the conditions. Supporting documentation must clearly demonstrateat least three of the following conditions: *A major portion of the existing housing stock is in need of substantialrepair or replacement * The neighborhood has lost its economic base to include such factors asa large proportion of its middle income households, supportive commercial/retailservices (e.g., grocer, pharmacy) and other investment patterns. Substantialdeterioration of its infrastructure is occurring (i.e., street repairs).* The average income level for the neighborhood is below 80 percent ofmedian income for the community as a whole * The neighborhood has been largely abandoned as evidenced by high vacancyrates Or 2. Projects which will effect neighborhood ``stabilization''. It must beclearly demonstrated that the neighborhood in which the project is locatedis threatened with moderate decline and that the proposed project willabate such decline. Supporting documentation must clearly demonstrate that:* The multi- and single-family housing stock is beginning to show clearsigns of deterioration as demonstrated by the need for moderate and substantialrehabilitation with a limited amount of the stock in need of replacement.* The income characteristics of the households have shown a downward trendover the past 5 years reflecting a flight of middle income households andthe loss of supportive commercial/retail services.  And/Or  3. Projects which promote an existing neighborhood development, redevelopment,or revitalization plan which is already under implementation. The planmust contain a coordinated strategy of land uses, including a housing component.For purposes of this section, the requirements of 24 CFR 805.15 as elaboratedupon in Part E, Neighborhood Preservation Purpose Applications, may beused. Development of some of the land use components must have alreadybegun; the HDG project cannot be the first activity under the plan. Examples of appropriate plans under this scenario include, Community DevelopmentBlock Grant Target Areas, Enterprise Zones and a mixed use waterfront developmentplan with community wide comprehensive planning which includes a neighborhood,land use, and a housing component. Examples of neighborhoods which would not qualify for points under thisfactor include gentrifying neighborhoods (i.e., neighborhoods on the inclinerather than decline), stable or stabilized neighborhoods where, althoughthe project may expand lower income housing opportunities, it will notenhance the economic base or effect a change in the character of the neighborhood.Failure to respond to the requirements of this section will result in nopoints under Selection Factor C for Neighborhood Development. Please makeall explanations concise, but with sufficient data for HUD to make determinations.Part M-7. Firm Financial Commitments and Site Control All requirements of Part M-7 of the Application Packet (Revised May, 1987)must be adhered to for maximum points in the rating and ranking process.However, the deadline for submission of these requirements and certainminimum requirements to fulfill the HDG thresholds are changed as follows:1. The deadline for any requirements under this Part, except under PartM-7.A. Equity Sources, is September 8, 1989. This includes minimum requirementsas well as requirements for Additional Points. Failure to provide the requirementsfor Equity Sources by the August 21, 1989 deadline will result in rejectionof the application on thresholds. 2. Minimum requirements for tax-exempt bond financing is changed. The applicationsubmission must contain either an inducement resolution as defined in theApplication Packet or a firm commitment from an investment banker or underwriterto purchase the bonds as specified in the Application Packet.

Under the Act, tax credits are provided to individuals and corporationswho invest in low-income rental housing. While the tax credit program isadministered by the Treasury Department and tax credit authority is allocatedto owners and developers by States, HUD has received many inquiries aboutthe potential for using tax credits with projects subsidized by the HousingDevelopment Grant (HDG) program. This Supplement to the HDG ApplicationPacket, Revised May 1987, addresses some concerns regarding use of thetax credits with the HDG program.The low-income housing tax credit legislation provides that the Federalportion of any grant made with respect to a project must be deducted froma project's eligible basis as defined by the tax credit legislation. TheConference Report accompanying the legislation specifically states:Examples of grants which may not be included in eligible basis includeCommunity Development Block Grants, Urban Development Action Grants, RentalRehabilitation Grants, and Housing Development Grants.Since the HDG is a Federal grant, it must be deducted from a project'seligible basis. Even when the HDG is used for costs which are not associatedwith the depreciable basis of the project_e.g., land acquisition or theHDG Project Investment Account, this rule still applies. It is unclear,however, whether the recycled Program Income from a Federal grant or interestfrom a HDG Project Investment Account will be considered Federal fundsthat must also be deducted from the tax credit eligible basis of a project.Only Treasury regulations can clarify these matters.Once the HDG has been deducted from the project's eligible basis, it qualifiesfor the 70 percent present value credit (9 percent in 1987). If the projectis ``federally subsidized'' in addition to the HDG, the eligible basisand/or the amount of the credit will be further affected.Within the context of the tax credit legislation, a project is federallysubsidized if it is financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds (or, althoughnot permitted by the HDG regulations, with another direct or indirect below-marketrate Federal loan, such as the Farmer's Home Administration Section 515program). If a project is federally subsidized by this definition, it qualifiesfor the 70 percent credit if the federally subsidized loan is deductedfrom the remaining eligible basis; or for the 30 percent credit (4 percentin 1987) if the loan is not deducted from the remaining eligible basis.<ITAG tagnum="81">Tenant Eligibility and the Lower Income Requirement</ITAG>Two areas of concern about the interface between HDG and Tax Credit relateto the level of income for qualifying tenants and the minimum number oflower income units. In both cases the two programs are basically compatible.An eligible tax credit project must provide at least 20 percent of theunits for families with incomes at 50 percent of median or below, 20/50rule, or 40 percent of the units for families with incomes at 60 percentof median or below, the 40/60 rule. In conjunction with the income levelof tenants at either 50 or 60 percent of median, there is a rent cap whichrequires the owner to charge a rent which does not exceed 30 percent ofthe 50 or 60 percent of median income level.HDG requires that at least 20 percent of the units be made available tolower income tenants with incomes of 80 percent of median or below anda rent cap of 30 percent of 50 percent of median. Therefore, projects usingthe 20/50 tax credit rule will also satisfy the HDG criteria. In fact,an owner could elect to provide 40 percent of the units for tenants below50 percent of median, be eligible for tax credit for those units and benefitunder HDG by earning 15 bonus points. An additional two points can be earnedfor serving very low-income families (an irrevocable commitment) underthe HDG rating criteria provided the tenants pay no more than 30 percentof their income for rent. Alternatively, an owner could elect to use the40/60 rule and further restrict rents for half of those units to 30 percentof 50 percent to meet the HDG criteria (i.e., 20/60 plus 20/50). Eitherof these alternatives can result in a feasible project which provides substantialbenefits to the project in terms of potential syndication proceeds. The tax credit provisions permit tenant incomes to rise by as much as 40percent above the 50 percent of median income level. This permits tenantincomes to rise to 70 percent of median, and remain tax credit eligibleas well as HDG eligible. Under HDG, when a tenant's income rises abovethe lower income limit (80 percent of median) the tenant must move outof the unit. In addition, the HDG restrictions must remain in place for20 years, while the tax credit has a 15 year compliance period.<ITAG tagnum="81">Determining Rents for the Lower Income Units</ITAG>Congress established rent caps on tax credit eligible units. Rents underHDG and tax credit programs are limited to 30 percent of the income ofa family whose income is 50 (or 60) percent of median for the area. Eventhough it is anticipated that Treasury will adopt HUD's method of estimating50 percent of median income, the rent calculations for determining 30 percentof 50 percent of median income are not the same for tax credits as forHDG. Consequently, owners who plan to use the two programs together shouldbe aware of the potential consequences.Important differences in the calculation of rents arise because HDG usesnet income of the family size <T3>expected </T3>to occupy the units as the basis for rent determinationwhile Treasury uses gross income of the family size <T3>actually </T3>occupying the unit. The attached table, ``HDG and TaxCredit Rent Comparisons,'' illustrates the potential impact on HDG rentswhen the rent computations also have to meet tax credit caps.Under tax credit provisions, gross incomes are not adjusted before determiningrent as is required by the statute for HDG and other assisted housing programs.Line A of the attached table uses the national average estimate of 50 percentof median income for the illustration with gross income adjusted for familysize (Columns 1-8). Line B reflects the maximum rent allowable under taxcredit at 30 percent of gross income. HDG, on the other hand, establishesmaximum rent at 30 percent of ``adjusted'' family income (Line C; see ExhibitM-5 of the Application Packet for computation). The income adjustment isbased upon the number of persons expected to live in the completed unit.For underwriting analysis, HDG has fixed the rents for various unit sizes.As shown on Line D of the Table, variations in the maximum rent to be collectedwith tax credits occur if the number of persons occupying the unit is notthe same as projected by HDG. The HDG projection for three persons in atwo bedroom unit, for example, would generate a maximum rent of $320 (lineC3). If the family size in that same unit were actually four rather thanthree, the tax credit provisions would allow a maximum rent of $380 (lineB4). On the other hand, a family of two in a two bedroom unit would becharged a maximum tax credit rent of $304. This analysis demonstrates thatwhen the number of household members exceeds the HDG projection, ownerswill be in violation of the HDG requirements if they charge higher rentsas allowed with tax credits. On the other hand, when the actual numberof households is less than the HDG projection, the maximum tax credit rentwill be lower than the HDG maximum. In the latter case, the owner mustcharge the lower rent to remain in compliance with the tax credit provisionsand will experience per unit revenue losses similar to those estimatedon Line E of the Table. These revenue losses are not extensive. A projectcontaining 30 lower income units, equally distributed between two and threebedroom units, for example, would have a maximum yearly impact of $7,020(15 unitsandmultiply;$16+15 unitsandmultiply;$23) in the unlikely event thatthe family size were smaller than the HDG projection in all of the unitsfor a whole year.Although the owner is free to charge the lower rents, the HDG cannot beused as an escrow for the losses nor can the HDG be used to write downthe costs to allow for this potential shortfall. Therefore, the owner isat risk. HUD is working with Treasury on issues relating to tax creditand HUD programs. For now, at least, owners and investors should preparefor this potential revenue loss.<ITAG tagnum="81">Rehabilitation Projects</ITAG>Although tax credit can be used with other assisted housing programs suchas Sections 8 and 236, the HDG regulations do not permit the use of HDGwith other Federal housing assistance programs except Section 8 ExistingCertificate and Housing Voucher Programs. On the other hand, HDG and taxcredit may work very well with existing projects which have, by naturaloccupancy patterns, become low-income projects over time.The HDG test for substantial rehabilitation is more stringent than TaxCredit provisions. HDG requires that the per unit rehabilitation costsbe more than $6,500, adjusted by the applicable high cost factor, or thatthere be replacement of more than one major building system that failslocal codes to qualify. Under tax credit, projects qualify with expendituresof $2,000 or more per unit. Hence, a project that meets the HDG substantialrehabilitation test will be tax credit eligible.<ITAG tagnum="81">Financing</ITAG>HDG does not require that a commitment be provided for tax credit <T3>unless </T3>it affects the project's ability to obtain financing. Wherea firm commitment cites tax credit as a condition for financing, then theapplication must reflect such a commitment as specified in Part M-7 ofthe Application Packet, Revised May 1987.Syndication proceeds are not an acceptable source of committed equity atthe application stage (unless subscriptions are provided in Part M-7).In the event that syndication does not generate sufficient funds to meetthe equity committed in the application, the owner's commitment is irrevocable.Moreover, at the evidentiary stage HDG will count as equity only thosesyndication payments to be contributed during the construction period.Therefore, any cash commitment for equity must be supported by the owner'snet worth statement reflecting assets equal to at least three times thecash to be contributed or a letter of credit or a commitment for a letterof credit in the amount of the owner's equity.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table: HODAG and Tax Credit Rent Comparisons</T4><H1>Line</H1><H1> </H1><H1>1</H1><H1>2</H1><H1>3</H1><H1>4</H1><H1>5</H1><H1>6</H1><H1>7</H1><H1>8</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A<D>National 50 percent median income by family size for 1987</D><D>$10,640, 1 person</D><D>$12,160, 2 persons</D><D>$13,680, 3 persons</D><D>$15,200, 4 persons</D><D>$16,150, 5 persons</D><D>$17,100, 6 persons</D><D>$18,050, 7 persons</D><D>$19,000, 8 persons</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B<D>Maximum monthly tax credit rents by family size</D><D>$2,66, 1 person</D><D>$304, 2 persons</D><D>$342, 3 persons</D><D>$380, 4 persons</D><D>$404, 5 persons</D><D>$428, 6 persons</D><D>$451, 7 persons</D><D>$475, 8 persons</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C<D>Maximum monthly HoDAG rents by unit size with prototypical income adjustments</D><D>$246, for 0 BR, 1 person</D><D>$284, for 1 BR, 2 persons</D><D>$320, for 2 BR, 3 persons</D><D> </D><D>$365, for 3 BR, 5 persons</D><D/><D>$412, for 4 BR, 7 persons</D><D>$424, for 5 BR, 8 persons</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D<D>Range of Treasury rents for smaller families with </D><T3>negative</T3> impact on HoDAG rental income<D>N/A</D><D>$266, for 1 person in 1 BR</D><D>$304, for 2 persons in 2 BR</D><D/><D>$342, for 3 persons in 3 BR, 4 persons N/A</D><D/><D>$380, for 4 persons, $404 for 5 persons in 4 BR, 6 persons N/A</D><D>$404 for 5 persons in 5 BR, 6 to 7 persons N/A</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">E<D>Maximum per monthly/per unit effect on HoDAG</D><D/><D>^$18</D><D>^$16</D><D/><D>^$23</D><D/><D>^$32</D><D>^$20</D><F>N/A: Not Applicable, i.e., Treasury rents are higher than HoDAG rentsso HoDAG maximums presumably apply.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Changes to the Application Packet From 1986 to 1987 The following items represent substantive changes and deletions to the1986 Housing Development Application Packet.

The provisions of the regulations (24 CFRPart 850) and the most recent Invitation for Applications (IFA) publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as elaborated upon in this Packet are also binding.The first determination to be made is whether the proposed project is eligiblefor an HDG award. The definition of a project is as follows: One or morebuildings containing similarly constructed units, the site(s) on whichthe building(s) is located, and any functionally related facilities. Multiplebuildings will constitute a project only if they are bound together asa result of proximate location, common ownership, and common financing.The following conditions <T3>must </T3>also be met: a. For a project with two or more sites, all sites must be located withinthe same neighborhood and generally within a THREE block radius of eachother. Further, each site must contain both lower income and market rateunits; b. The lower income units must be of the same construction type, but neednot contain the same interior amenities or the same amount of floor spaceas long as livability is maintained. The exterior of the lower income unitsmust be indistinguishable from the exterior of the market rate units; c. The project must be non-transient, residential, rental, cooperativeor mutual housing and may not contain special purpose space, e.g., medicalfacilities requiring specialized features which increase the cost of construction.d. The project must contain not less than 20 and no more than 200 units.e. Commercial space in the project is limited to 10 percent. Up to 20 percentof the gross floor area may be designated for commercial use with adequatejustification. Portions of the project building cannot be legally separatedthrough establishment of a condominium regime to circumvent the 20 percentlimitation on commercial space. f. A building developed with HDG funds cannot be legally separated throughestablishment of a condominium regime for the purpose of creating a legallyseparated portion which can be used for non-rental, single family housing,i.e., condominiums. g. HDG funds may not be used in conjunction with a project which is currently,or anticipated to be, assisted under any other Federal housing assistanceprogram including the Urban Development Action Grant. Section 312 and FarmersHome Administration Section 515 programs. (This does not include the Section8 Existing Housing Certificate and Voucher programs.) Projects which wereformerly assisted under Section 305 or 313 of the National Housing Act,or projects which were formerly HUD-held or HUD owned are also not eligibleto receive HDG funds. h. Manufactured home parks and manufactured (mobile) homes are not eligiblefor the program. For HDG purposes, ``manufactured home parks'' are definedas rental communities of single-family manufactured (mobile) homes, wherethe occupants either own their manufactured home and rent the site on whichthe home is placed, or where both the home and the site are rented. ForHDG purposes, ``manufactured home'' means a structure, transportable inone or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designedto be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connectedto the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioningand electrical systems contained therein. In addition to meeting the definition of an HDG project, every applicationmust pass all nineteen threshold requirements as set forth in 24 CFR 850.37and as described in Attachment 1 of this Packet. Failure to meet any oneof the threshold requirements or the requirements stated above will resultin rejection of the application and no further consideration will be givenfor funding. Once you have determined that the application meets all of the thresholdrequirements, you should review the competitive Project Selection Factorsincluded in Attachment 2 of this Packet. A flow chart of the program isalso included so that you will know the approximate timing of the entireHDG process from the Invitation for Applications through Project Closeout(see Attachment 3). Since the HDG awards are highly competitive, we encourage you to reviewthis entire Packet carefully before proceeding. Information included inyour application submission must be clear, comprehensive and sufficientlydocumented to permit HUD to make all of the necessary determinations andto ensure adequate consideration of the application. Be certain that alldocuments are submitted, the proper forms and formats have been used, thatthe application and certifications have been signed as appropriate andthat all exhibits/documents are placed in the designated parts of the applicationto avoid possible oversight by HUD reviewers. Since HUD will ``look behind''any certification that appears questionable, explanatory material may beappropriate even when not requested in the Packet. During the applicationreview process, HUD <T3>may </T3>request clarification after the submission deadline has passed.Where there is no documentation, or the documentation provided is clearlyinsufficient to make appropriate determinations, the application will berejected under Threshold No. 2. <T3>Absolutely no waivers will be granted to permit deviations from theregulatory requirements or Application Packet prior to or during the applicationreview or selection process. </T3>Owners and applicants should review the requirements on limitations anduses of the grant, project financing, appraisals and drawings in Part Mof the Packet. Potential applicants (i.e., cities, counties, towns, townships,units of local government) not included in the list of Designated EligibleAreas applicable to the current funding round, and States applying on behalfof units of local government should review Parts B-1, E, and F to determineif a Special Housing Need or a Neighborhood Preservation Purpose applicationcan be supported. HUD reserves the right to evaluate a project's economic structure to determinethat the grant amount requested is not <T3>clearly </T3>in excess of the amount needed to provide decent rentalor cooperative housing of modest design that is affordable to familieswithout other reasonable and affordable housing alternatives in the privatemarket. This will include an assessment of the owner's return on equity,project costs, rents, terms and conditions of financing and the amountof the owner's equity to determine if they are reasonable and appropriate.The amount of the grant requested may be reduced at the time of applicationreview, preparation of the HUD/Grantee Grant Agreement or Cost Certificationor an application may be rejected where clear excesses exist. <T3>Under no circumstances will a grant request be increased. </T3>THE DEADLINE FOR APPLICATION SUBMISSION IS CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE DATESPECIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT <T4>FEDERAL REGISTER </T4>PUBLICATION OF THE INVITATION FOR APPLICATIONSFOR THE HDG PROGRAM. THE APPLICATION SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED AT BOTHHEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, DC AND THE HUD FIELD OFFICE covering the jurisdictionin which the project is located. Close of business for Headquarters is5:15 P.M. EST. Addresses and telephone numbers of the appropriate HUD fieldoffices may be found in the Invitation for Applications. Contact the appropriateoffice to determine close of business. Applications must be received byHUD at those times and a receipt should be requested. Applications whichhave postmarks prior to that time but which are not received by BOTH Headquarters<T3>and </T3>the field office by the deadline will be returned. Applications to Headquarters must be submitted to and requests for informationshould be addressed to : <ITAG tagnum="15">Director, Housing Development Grant Division, Room 6110, U.S. Departmentof Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,DC 20410 </ITAG>While general information will be available by calling the HDG staff at(202) 755-6142, only written answers will serve as grounds for appealingany subsequent HUD determinations.

(There are no project size exclusions.)For any application that is subject to the requirements of Executive Order12372, the applicant must initiate the intergovernmental review processby sending a copy of the application to the appropriate state review coordinatingofficial or entity before submitting it to HUD. The name and address ofthe appropriate state review coordinating official or entity may be obtainedfrom the HUD field office in whose jurisdiction the proposed project willbe located. A copy of the transmittal letter to the state along with anyreview comments already available from the state ``single point of contact''or other commenting parties should be included in the application. Part 52 allows clearinghouses 30 days in which to comment, hence, applicantsare encouraged to submit applications to the appropriate clearinghouseas early as possible.Part B. Applicant (and Jurisdiction) Information; Additional Assistanceto Lower Income or Very Low-Income TenantsPart B-1. Eligibility of theApplicantThis section deals only with the eligibility of the applicant, not theeligibility of the application. This section should include a narrativestatement indicating the basis for eligibility and, in the case of stateapplicants, the additional information discussed below. Any unit of generallocal government, including cities, counties, towns, townships, parishes,villages, or other general purpose political subdivision of a state, andany state, acting on behalf of and with the concurrence of a unit of generallocal government, is an eligible applicant. States applying on behalf ofunits of general local government must submit evidence of concurrence ofthe unit of general local government generally in the form of a letterfrom the chief executive officer (CEO) of the jurisdiction. Such applicationsmust be signed by the Governor. A state or local housing finance agency (HFA) or any other independentpublic agency (IPA) is not eligible to apply but may serve as an agentof an eligible applicant (a state or unit of general local government).HFA's/IPA's may administer the program provided that: (1) the HFA/IPA enablinglegislation clearly permits the ability to act as program administrator,<T3>and</T3> (2) the CEO of the grantee (the Governor, in the case of astate applicant) has delegated to the HFA/IPA the authority of programadministration which could include preparation of the application. Notwithstandingprogram administration by the HFA/IPA, the CEO or an official who is authorizedto commit the applicant to such agreements, must sign the application,execute the HUD/Grantee Grant Agreement and the Owner/Grantee Agreementand expressly agree to maintain ultimate responsibility for enforcementof program requirements. The applicant and the owner must be separate and distinct entities. Theapplicant may not be the owner. Additional information on eligibility isprovided in the HDG regulations at Section 850.3.Part B-2. Performance, Capacity and Rent MechanismDiscuss the applicant's (a) performance in meeting assisted housing needs,and (b) its capacity to administer the HDG program. In the section on performance, describe the applicant's past performancein the area of housing assistance, including achievements in meeting HousingAssistance Plan goals and in administering any federally assisted housingprograms in its jurisdiction such as Section 8, Public Housing, housingUDAGs, FmHA, HDG, or CDBG housing related activities. The capacity of the applicant to administer the HDG program should be addressedin detail. Describe the administrative structure which will be responsiblefor HDG activities: how the applicant will clear any known impediments(e.g., zoning, sewer taps, alley abandonment) to a timely constructionstart; the staff available or to be made available; how construction orrehabilitation progress will be monitored; how grant funds will be requisitionedand handled (see 24 CFR 850.65); and generally, how the post-constructionresponsibilities of the applicant (grantee) identified in Subparts D, E,and F of the regulations will be met. A document for Rent Mechanism and Tenant Eligibility Determination hasbeen included (Exhibit B-2) in this Packet. In order to receive the onepoint assigned to this requirement (Selection Factor F.1), and to be eligibleto receive up to three points for Selection Factor F.2, Exhibit B-2 mustbe executed by the chief executive officer or designee. At the time ofGrant Agreement preparation, this exhibit may be modified to reflect theparticular characteristics of the project. Part B-3. Additional Assistance to Lower Income or Very Low-Income TenantsPoints will be assigned (Selection Factor F.2.) to applications proposingadditional assistance through a subsidy mechanism which: (a) assists tenants with incomes below 50% of median (very low-income)to pay no more than 30% of their income for rent and utilities. (The relevantcomparison is the percentage of very low-income units to total units withthe higher percentage receiving more points.) OR (b) extends the period of assistance for all of the lower income unitsto 25 or more years. (The greater number of years will receive more points.)To receive points under item (a) above, applicants must include (in PartB-3 or Part M-7) a signed statement which: (1) specifies the number and size of units to receive the assistance; and(2) commits the owner to give occupancy priority to the very low-incomefor these units; and(3) commits the applicant or the owner to provide the resources necessaryto compensate for the resulting revenue loss. (If the owner elects to absorbthe revenue loss, an estimate of the revenue loss must be provided andit must be demonstrated that the project's financial feasibility will notbe jeopardized.) To receive points for (b) above, applicants must include (in Part B-3 orPart M-7) the commitment identified in (3) above. WHEN ASSISTANCE TO VERYLOW-INCOME TENANTS IS PROVIDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE RELOCATION REQUIREMENTSOF PART I OF THIS PACKET, NO POINTS WILL BE ASSIGNED. Restrictions 1. The additional assistance must not require HDG funds beyond that requiredto maintain the units at HDG formula rent levels or beyond 20 years. 2. Points will not be given where the additional assistance is in the formof vouchers, certificates, or other Federal assistance. Part B-4. HAP Compliance Applications must include: 1. Comments from the chief executive officer (CEO) of the unit of generallocal government solicited in accordance with Section 213 of the Housingand Community Development Act of 1974, and either 2. Evidence that the proposed project is consistent with the three-yeargoals and the general locations set forth in the most recently approvedHousing Assistance Plan, if any; OR 3. For localities where no Housing Assistance Plan is in effect, a letterfrom the unit of general local government indicating that the project isconsistent with the need for housing assistance and that public facilitiesand services for the project are adequate. Variations on HAP Goals and General Locations 1. Applications proposing a site not included in a general location specifiedin the HAP will be considered by HUD only if an approvable (to be determinedduring the application review process) HAP amendment was submitted to thefield office <T3>prior to</T3> submission of the HDG application. 2. Applications which propose to exceed the three-year HAP goals by nomore than 20 percent will be considered if HUD approval is necessary (a)to obtain a project of feasible size and type; or (b) to meet urgent unforeseenneeds (e.g., displacement due to natural disasters); and (c) the applicationcontains a written statement from the CEO in compliance with 24 CFR 791.3. Applications which propose to exceed the three-year HAP goals by morethan 20 percent will be considered only if an approvable (to be determinedduring the application review process) HAP amendment was submitted to thefield office prior to submission of the HDG application. Part C. Applicant and Owner CertificationsCertifications and assurances are required of applicants and owners. Thesecertifications and assurances are included in this Packet as Exhibits C-1and C-2 and must be signed by the appropriate parties. Part D. Applicant's Project Selection Method and Program Description Briefly describe the method used to select the project(s) submitted underthe program and indicate what consideration was given to the items listedin 24 CFR 850.33(c). Applicants submitting more than one application must briefly describe theoverall HDG program including a description of the types of projects proposedand a general schedule for carrying out the program. Submit the same descriptionwith each project application.Applicants must also indicate in this section the method of public consultationused in developing the HDG program. HUD does not specify the method ofpublic consultation. HUD does, however, expect the applicant to do whatis necessary to satisfy itself that there has been adequate public consultationto withstand any challenge of failure to consider public views. This couldinclude some mechanism which notifies the general public about the applicant'slocal HDG program and provides the general public an opportunity to presentoral or written comments or concerns. The applicant must certify that thisprogram was developed after public consultation (Exhibit C-1). Part E. Application Eligibility Applications may be submitted under one of three categories: (1) DesignatedEligible Areas (DEA), (2) Special Housing Need, or (3) Neighborhood PreservationPurpose. DEA applications do not need to address Part E of this ApplicationPacket. Applicants filing under categories (2) or (3) must follow the instructionsbelow. Special Housing Need Applications A special housing need application may be submitted where there is (1)a need for housing by a special group of renter households in the jurisdictionor the housing market area, or (2) a special need for rental housing overallas a result of significant changes in the rental housing market <T3>since the 1980 Census. </T3>If a housing market area is used insteadof a jurisdiction, the boundaries must conform with Part G, item 3 of thisPacket. Applicants documenting a Special Housing Need are requested to discusstheir information, methodologies and data source(s) with the HUD fieldoffice economist prior to application submission. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Special Renter Group </ITAG>A special renter group application provides evidence of a need for rentalhousing by households having specific social, economic, or demographiccharacteristics. Examples of special renter groups are: large families(five or more persons needing 3 or more bedroom units), or families withphysically disabled members in need of barrier-free housing. In the analysis and documentation of the severity of need, the applicantmust provide: (a) information on the duration of the need in the locality,e.g., a chronic on-going need since 1980; (b) information which supportsthe severity of the need and the lack of available housing to meet thatneed, e.g., low vacancy rates in units of the size or type needed, longwaiting lists for projects with units meeting the need, the number of unitsof the size or type needed in relation to the number of units in the rentalinventory as a whole, or information on the lack of production of suchunits to meet the special renter group need; (c) a showing that the projectis responsive to the needs of the special renter group, i.e., all of thelower income units in the project must serve the special renter group andthe remaining units must be compatible in terms of unit sizes and types;and (d) a discussion of why the need cannot be adequately addressed byalternative means considering any Federal, State, local government or privatesector opportunities. Vacancy rate information is not required for Special Renter Group needsin Part E; however, the applicant must provide vacancy data in Part G.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Change or Dislocation in the Rental Market </ITAG>A special housing need application in this category must provide evidenceof significant changes in the overall rental housing market <T3>since the 1980 Census. </T3>The change or dislocation must have affected the entire rental housingmarket, not just a segment of the market, thereby creating ``tight'' conditionsin the overall rental housing market. The methodology used to determinethe current overall rental vacancy rate in this Part E.2. must be the samemethodology used in Part G of this Packet. The analysis of the severity of need must include: (a) an explanation ofthe current condition of the overall rental market; (b) an explanationof the causes for the change in the market since the 1980 Census; and (c)an estimate of the current rental vacancy rate and the rental vacancy ratein 1980, for the housing market area as a whole. The analysis of the need should address the causes of the change or dislocationsuch as: natural disasters, large scale abandonments, deterioration orconversions resulting in significant losses from rental inventory, rapidpopulation and household growth due to increased employment opportunitiesor in-migration, coupled with little or no production of rental housingto meet the demand, or other factors which have resulted in the currenttight rental housing market conditions. In addition, the applicant should provide information on current marketconditions that would give evidence of the severity of need. Such evidencemay include an increase in occupancy of units that are of marginal qualityand acceptability, large increases in rents in excess of project costs,rapid absorption of new rental units, long waiting lists for projects ofall types (assisted and unassisted), or data indicating declining productionof rental units in areas showing significant growth of rental households.The analysis of need should explain how the change or dislocation has affectedall renter households in the overall market and lower income renter householdsin particular. The analysis should also include any information that indicateshow long the tight market condition will continue or if it will worsendue to factors such as continued decline in production of rental housingand continued rapid household growth. The estimated current rental vacancy rate should be derived using: (1)local source data for a substantial portion of the units in the rentalmarket or a sample cross section of all rental units of all types and rentranges that would be representative of the current rental market in thearea as a whole, or (2) local source data on the trend in the rental vacancyrate from 1980 to the present that would, using 1980 Census data as a benchmark,show a significant reduction in the current rate. The current vacancy ratemust be compatible to the 1980 Census vacancy definition, representingactual rental units, not solely vacancy by type of structure. <T3>The current rental vacancy rate must be less than seven (7) percent</T3>in the case of a Special Housing Need application based on a changeor dislocation in the rental market. All rental vacancy rates must be calculated as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,14,47 </C>  <H1>Vacancy rate=</H1><H1>Units vacant ``for rent'' </H1><H2>Units vacant ``for rent''+Renter occupied units</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> Neighborhood Preservation Purpose Applications An application submitted as a Neighborhood Preservation Purpose applicationmust propose a project which is located in a neighborhood preservationarea which meets the standards described in the regulations at Section850.15(c). Further, the proposed project must advance the particular goalsof the neighborhood preservation area strategy. An example of an unacceptablecase would be where the goal is to rehabilitate an area of neighborhoodcommercial structures. The provision of housing in such a neighborhoodwould not be acceptable. If the goal is to rehabilitate existing low-riseresidential rental property, the provision of a newly constructed high-risestructure would not advance the goal of the neighborhood preservation strategy.The regulations require that public and private efforts be undertaken witha coordinated plan for long-term improvement of the area and that <T3>such efforts be underway at the time of application submission. </T3>NeighborhoodStrategy Areas approved under Housing or CDBG programs where activitiesare underway, would be considered appropriate neighborhood preservationareas for HDG. It is important that evidence of compliance with all regulatory standardsbe submitted in as brief a format as possible. Evidence should includea copy of the neighborhood preservation strategy, proof of an ongoing commitmentto the neighborhood preservation area, information on funds budgeted forthe area and the certainty of such funding. Part F. Infeasibility of Moderate Rehabilitation to Meet the Purposes ofthe Proposed Project_Certification and Justification Special Housing Need or Neighborhood Preservation Purpose applicationswill be reviewed to determine whether moderate rehabilitation could beused in the project neighborhood (project neighborhood is defined at 24CFR 850.3 and Part H-1 of this Packet) to produce the same type of lowerincome units (by bedroom size and occupancy) proposed in the applicationsubmission. If moderate rehabilitation will produce the same type of units,a Special Need or Neighborhood Preservation Purpose application will berejected without further review. The application must include: (1) Exhibit F, Moderate Rehabilitation Exclusion Certification, with appropriatebox(es) checked and signed by the applicant, and (2) a justification for the reason(s) checked on the Certification. The certification and justification will be carefully reviewed by HUD.Most of the reasons listed in Exhibit F are self-explanatory; however,certain items warrant further discussion. Item 3 indicates that the definition used for neighborhood under the RentalRehabilitation Program is different from the definition used in this program(see 24 CFR 850.3, Project Neighborhood) and could well permit a much smallerarea. For this reason, the project neighborhood considered in this programcould contain within it a project which is currently receiving assistanceunder the Rental Rehabilitation Program. If the Rental Rehabilitation projectis producing the same type of lower income units that are included in theproposed HDG project, the applicant may not check this box. It is anticipated that there will be few circumstances in when Item 6 willbe permitted to justify the infeasibility of moderate rehabilitation. Possiblegrounds for such certification might be that the entire neighborhood iscomposed of single family sales-type homes or condominium units, both ofwhich are ineligible under HDG. Under Items 4 and 5, it is understood that there may be very few singleunits, scattered throughout the neighborhood, which could be moderatelyrehabilitated to produce units of the same bedroom size or occupancy typeas the proposed lower income units. It is not intended that such very limited,isolated instances would be grounds for rejection of an application. Part G. Housing Shortage HUD will give favorable consideration to proposed projects in jurisdictionshaving lower rental vacancy rates and tighter market conditions relativeto the rates and conditions in other applicant jurisdictions. Two criteriawill be used: (1) the overall rental vacancy rate in the jurisdiction orhousing market area and (2) the aggregate rental vacancy rate in all lowerincome census tracts in the jurisdiction. For jurisdictions without censustracts and which do not choose to develop current estimates using otherdata (see 2(b) and 2(c) below), the estimated current overall rental vacancyrate for the jurisdiction or the housing market area in which the projectis to be located can be used for both criteria. The 1980 and estimated current rental vacancy rates for both criteria mustbe shown in Exhibit G and stated in narrative form for Part G. 1. Overall Rental Vacancy Rates In order to demonstrate low vacancy rate relative to other jurisdictions,the applicant must submit: a. The 1980 Census Rental Vacancy Rate for the jurisdiction or the housingmarket area (see Item 3. below):All vacancy rates must be calculated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,15,1,46</C> <H1>Vacancy Rate</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Units Vacant ``for rent'' </H1><H2>Renter Occupied Unit's + Units Vacant ``for rent''</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>b. Estimate of Current Overall Rental Vacancy Rate for the jurisdictionor housing market area:The estimated current overall rental vacancy rate should be derivied using(i) data for, or a recent local survey of, a substantial portion of theunits in the rental market reflecting a cross section of all rental unitsof all types and rent ranges that would be representative of the currentrental inventory as a whole; or (ii) local source data on the trend inrental vacancies or vacancy rates since 1980, using the 1980 data as abenchmark and applying the trend of change in vacancies or rates from 1980to the current date to yield a current rate. Appliants should ensure that the methods and techniques used in gatheringand analyzing the data are adequate to yield statistically reliable resultsand are compatible to methods used in Census definitions and calculations.Applicants who intend to conduct special surveys should discuss their planwith the local field office economist prior to application submission.In addition, prior consultations is advisable as to data sources, methodsand estimates since all data and estimates will be evaluated during theapplication review and no opportunties for changes will be permitted afterapplication submission. c. Current Conditions and Change in the Rental Market:Applicants must provide information that demonstrates the severity or extentof housing shortage. Evidence should address the cause of the changes inthe market since 1980 which have resulted in the current tight rental housingmarket conditions. The description should include such information anddata as the rate of absorption of new rental units, length of waiting listsfor both new and existing projects of all types (assisted), increases inrents, declines in rental production relative to demand and household growth,significant losses from the rental inventory due to demolition, conversionand other causes. The demonstration should also include any informationthat indicates that the current tight market will continue or worsen overthe next two years.2. Lower-Income Rental Vacancy RatesThe lower income rental vacancy rate can be determined by the applicantby using either a., b., or c. below.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. 1980 Census Data</ITAG>For applicants in areas with census tract data, the process for makingthis determination involves the following two steps:1. Using the 1980 Census, determine all census tracts in the jurisdictionhaving median family incomes at or below 80 percent of the median familyincome for the area. If an applicant is in a metropolitan jurisdiction,the area should be that currently defined by the Office of Management andBudget as a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or a Primary MetropolitanStatistical Area (PMSA). For a nonmetropolitan jurisdiction, the area isdefined as the county. The appropriate 1980 ``80 percent of median familyincome'' figure can be obtained from the field office economist. ii. For each lower income census tract within the jurisdiction or housingmarket area, calculate the total units reported as ``renter occupied''and the vacant units reported as ``for rent''. Add the totals for all censustracts. Divide the total ``renter occupied'' units into the aggregate ofall units ``for rent.'' The formula is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,15,1,42</C> <H1>Vacancy Rate</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Units vacant ``for rent''</H1><H2>Units vacant ``for rent'' + ``Renter Occupied''</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>For applicants in jurisdictions without census tracts, the current overallrental vacancy rate may be used for this criterion if the applicant doesnot choose to develop an estimate using other methods as described in (b)and (c) below.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Use of Data Other Than the 1980 Census</ITAG>Applicants are encouraged to use 1980 Census data to determine the lowerincome rental vacancy rate; however, applicants attempting to demonstratea significant reduction in vacany rates since 1980 may use other more recentdata.Local surveys may be relied upon provided methods and techniques used ingathering and analyzing the data are adequate to yield statistically reliableresults and are comparable to methods used for census calculations. If an applicant's jurisdiction is delineated by census tracts, and it wishesto provide current data on lower income rental housing vacancy rates, itshould define lower income census tracts using 80 percent of HUD's mostrecent estimate of median family income. This estimate can be obtainedfrom the local field office economist.Applicants who intend to conduct special surveys, or use other data toupdate census information, are strongly urged to discuss their plans, methodologiesand data sources with the local field office economist prior to applicationsubmission. Prior consultation is advisable since all survey data willbe evaluated during the application review process and no opportunity tomake changes will be permitted after application submission. Failure tocontact the field office economist may result in refjection of your methodologiesand data. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Use of Lower Income Vacancy Rates Calculated for Specific Categoriesof Rental Housing </ITAG>Applicants who feel that the overall <T3>lower income</T3> rental vacancy rates do not represent the shortageof housing for a particular category of renter units may wish to providevacancy rate information solely for a specified category. Local data orsurveys cited must be confined to the specific category of units that areconsidered to be in short supply and are being proposed as the lower incomeunits in the application. Calculation of a vacancy rate for a specificcategory of rental housing will only be considered for the lower incomevacancy rate, not for the overall rental vacancy rate.An example of this situation would be where the lower income vacancy among<T3>standard</T3> quality rental housing is much lower than that for <T3>all</T3> rental housing. It may also be the case that the lower incomevacancy rate for a particular size unit is significantly less than theoverall rental vacancy rate.Vacancy rates for cooperative or mutual housing units alone will not beaccepted where higher vacancy rates exist for <T3>rental</T3> units of the same size and type.3. Use of the Housing Market AreaIn very unusual circumstances, applications from very large or very smalljurisdictions may request that the determination of rental vacancy ratesbe made for a housing market area. The definitions of housing <T3>market</T3> area, for purposes of this program, are as follows:a. Jurisdictions subdivided by boroughs, counties, or country equivalents,and are located in large metropolitan areas (MSAs/PMSAs as defined by theOffice of Management and Budget), may be considered separate housing marketareas. This determination should consider whether the area qualifies asa distinct housing market based on such factors as geographic barriers,large population concentrations, or a separate economic base as determinedby commuting patterns and major sources of employment. Applicants shoulddetermine overall rental vacancy rates both within the defined market areaas a whole, as in 1. above and within lower income census tracts in thedefined market area as in 2. above. It is expected that this situationwould occur rarely and only in very large metropolitan areas. b. For very small jurisdictions in both metropolitan and nonmetropolitanareas, the housing market may be larger than the jurisdiction in whichthe proposed project is to be located. The market area in such cases mayinclude several contiguous communities or an entire country. Such marketareas should be used only where there is reasonable expectation that theproposed project would attract households from the entire area. The useof a market area in order to increse the apparent demand for a large projectshould be avoided in areas where the population is dispersed over a widegeographic area. Typically only localities having populations of less than25,000 would use housing market area data rather than jurisdiction data.In nonmetropolitan areas where census tracts have been delineated, theapplicant should provide the rental vacancy rate based on the lower incomecensus tracts. Where no tract delineations are available, only the currentoverall rental vacancy rate needs to be calculated for the housing marketarea unless the applicant chooses to develop other data to indicate thecurrent lower income vacancy rate as described in 2.b and 2.c above.Where housing market area data rather than jurisdiction data are used inPart G, data used to address Parts E (Special Housing Needs) and H-2 (LocationalOpportunities Data), if applicable, must also address the housing marketarea. Part H. Neighborhood InformationH-1. Neighborhood Identification and DescriptionThe neighborhood of the proposed project must be identified in accordancewith the definition contained in the regulation at 24 CFR 850.3, ProjectNeighborhood. The neighborhood should first be identified using significantdistinguishing features such as those identified in paragraph (b) of thedefinition. If the neighborhood does not contain a population of 2,500persons, the boundaries should be expanded in all directions to includeresidential housing until the minimum population is attained. This areathen becomes the neighborhood for determination of the infeasibility ofmoderate rehabilitation (Exhibit F) and similar neighborhood determinations.A map of the project neighborhood depicting boundaries and delineatingany census designations should be included. A brief description of the neighborhood should be provided including generalindications of building construction type and condition, income of residents,public facilities, recent changes in character or investment patterns,and similar information. H-2. Locational Housing Opportunities Data Under Selection Factor J, Locational Housing Opportunities, and in compliancewith 24 CFR 850.39(b)(10), a maximum of five points may be awarded onlyto projects which are located: a. outside areas of minority concentration where the current pattern showsmost assisted housing in minority areas; or b. in project neighborhoods where there is no other assisted housing; orc. in project neighborhoods undergoing revitalization through public orprivate investment and in which rental opportunities for lower income householdsare declining. An application will be awarded points if acceptable documentation is providedshowing that the project meets any one of these criteria. Points will beassigned in accordance with Selection Factor J of Attachment 2 in thisPacket. Where no documentation is provided, zero points may be assigned,provided showing that the project meets any one of these criteria. Pointswill be assigned in accordance with Selection Factor J of Attachment 2of this Packet. Where no documentation is provided, zero points will beassigned. For purposes of the above locational criteria: andbullet; an ``area of minority concentration'' is an area in which thepercentage of the population that is minority is greater than the percentageof the total population, of the unit of local government, that is minority,and andbullet; ``assisted housing'' includes housing units assisted under Section8 New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation or Moderate Rehabilitation;Section 202; Section 23 Public Housing; Section 236; and Section 221(d)(3)BMIR programs, FmHA 515, HDG with 40% or more lower income. Assisted housingdoes <T3>not</T3> include units assisted under the Section 8 Existing Certificateor Housing Voucher programs or the section 235 program. To receive consideration for points under the first locational criterion,the applicant should provide racial demographics of the project neighborhoodand jurisdiction and data on the distribution of assisted housing projectswithin the jurisdiction of the unit of local government, including theproject neighborhood. If no other assisted housing exists within the boundaries of the projectneighborhood, the applicant should so state in order to receive pointsunder the second criterion. To receive consideration for points under the third criterion, the applicantshould provide racial demographics and incomes of households in the projectneighborhood and information on the level of public and/or private investmentand on the rate of change and approximate loss of rental housing unitsfor lower income households in the area. If the proposed project does not clearly provide one of the opportunitiesfor which points will be awarded, the applicant may so state. Part H-3. Effect of Proposed Project on Neighborhood Development The applicant should describe the physical, social and economic effectsof the project on the neighborhood. If HUD determines that the projectwill have a negative effect on the neighborhood, the project may be rejectedbased on Threshold 12. If HUD determines that the project will have a positiveeffect on the neighborhood, and the project meets all threshold requirements,it will be assigned one point based on Selection Factor C.1. Typical considerations in determining a positive or negative neighborhoodeffect include: compatibility with existing land uses, increased demandon traffic and other environmental burdens, complementary effects on employmentpatterns, and/or the likely effect of the project on recent changes inneighborhood character and investment patterns. Generally, a positive <T3>social or physical effect</T3> on a neighborhood is one which enhancessome valuable cultural, architectural or environmental quality of the neighborhood,especially if the neighborhood is changing. Erosion of such a positivequality would be a negative effect. A positive <T3>economic</T3> effect would enhance the economic stability of a decliningor low-income neighborhood; however, HUD will view any unmitigated displacementresulting from such an effect as negative. Sometimes a project will not be large enough to have a significant positiveimpact on the surrounding area. Many projects will have both positive andnegative effects. In these instances, it is possible that the project mightpass the threshold requirement for project acceptability but not qualifyfor the point. Part I. Relocation/Displacement Information 24 CFR 850.35(d)(2)(iii)(A) requires that no household, regardless of income,be permanently displaced as a result of the rehabilitation or constructionof a project under HDG, unless said household has received advance writtennotice, appropriate advisory services concerning counseling or housingopportunities, tenant rights under the Federal Fair Housing law, and guidancein searching for suitable replacement housing. Sites proposed for HDG projects which at the time of application submissionhouse tenants who will be temporarily relocated or permanently displacedmust address Part I. Applicants must submit a statement indicating whetherthere are any residential tenants living on the proposed project site whowill be temporarily relocated or permanently displaced as a result of developmentof the project. In order to comply with 24 CFR 850.35(d)(2), this statementmust provide the following information; 1. Number of households by size, income and race expected to be permanentlydisplaced, and in a separate listing, those expected to be temporarilyrelocated without regard to income level of tenants. 2. Without regard to income levels of tenants, a description of the housingfacilities expected to be available for occupancy by temporary relocateesand permanent displacees. 3. A description of the financial assistance, advisory services and anyother services to be provided to temporary relocatees and permanent displacees.4. A chart which clearly defines the estimated cost of all relocation benefitsand services, including identification of the source(s) of funding. 5. The anticipated timetable for carrying out all necessary relocationactivities. 6. Sample letter to be used informing tenants moving into the project aftersubmission of the HDG application that they may be displaced due to plannedrehabilitation activities and that they will not be entitled to any relocationbenefits or assistance. 7. A commitment that the applicant will comply with the Uniform RelocationAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (UniformAct), if the site is acquired by a state agency. [A state agency is defined as any department, agency or instrumentalityof a state or of a political subdivision of a state or states. If an applicantacquires property under the HDG program, the Uniform Act will apply. Whenthe Uniform Act applies, and the HDG regulations are more stringent, i.e.,one for one replacement of very low-income households, the more stringentregulation will apply.] If any lower income (80 percent of median or below) household is to bepermanently displaced, the applicant or owner is obligated to provide financialassistance in an amount sufficient for that household to obtain affordablereplacement housing, as defined under 24 CFR 813.107(a), for a minimumof two years. If any lower income household is to be temporarily relocated as a resultof rehabilitation or construction of a project, the household must be providedwith the following: a. Decent, safe and sanitary temporary housing; b. Financial assistance sufficient, as determined by the applicant, tocover reasonable expenses, including moving costs to and from the temporaryhousing, rent and utilities; and c. A unit of appropriate size in the rehabilitated or newly constructedproject at a cost equal to or less than that which would apply under 24CFR 813.107(a). If <T3>very low-income tenants</T3> (50 percent of median or below) are tobe permanently displaced or temporarily relocated, the following must alsobe provided: 1. A statement describing how the applicant will ensure compliance withthe statutory and regulatory (24 CFR 850.35(d)(1)) restrictions on theinvoluntary displacement of very low-income households. The regulation states that no very low-income household, as defined in24 CFR 813.102, may be displaced by a household which is not very low-income.In the event a very low-income household is displaced, that household mustbe replaced by another very low-income household. Upon completion of a project, any very low-income household which has beentemporarily relocated as a result of the project will pay rent which isthe lower of the HDG rent, or the rent required by 24 CFR 813.107(a). A``replacement'' very low-income household will pay the HDG formula rent.The following example is provided to illustrate this obligation. At the time of application submission, 15 very low-income households areliving in a project. Five choose not to live in the rehabilitated (or newlyconstructed project), five are permanently displaced because there is nounit to accommodate the family size or composition, and five are temporarilyrelocated, and then moved back into the completed project. The completed project is for 50 units. The grant application specifies10 HDG units, but the project must maintain 15 very low-income householdsat initial occupancy because there were 15 very low-income households inthe project at the time of application.The five households which were temporarily relocated will return to thecompleted project and pay the rent required by 24 CFR 813.107(a), or theHDG rent, whichever is lower. The ten households which were permanentlydisplaced must be replaced by other very low-income households who willpay HDG rents. Five of the ``replacement'' households will live in HDGunits and five will live in market rate units. 2. A written commitment from the owner guaranteeing placement in the completedproject of at least as many very low-income households as were in residenceat the time of application submission. The owner must also agree to complywith all regulations at 24 CFR 850. This latter obligation may require a further financial commitment fromthe owner/applicant. The pro forma required in Part M-12 of this Packetmust reflect the revenue to be lost as a result of households paying rentsin accordance with 24 CFR 813.107(a) and as a result of those occupyingmarket rate units and paying HDG formula rents. The pro forma must alsodemonstrate financial feasibility to HUD's satisfaction. Where such feasibilitycannot be demonstrated, the applicant or the owner must provide an escrowaccount adequate to cover any shortfall. To determine the amount to be escrowed, the applicant or owner must useone or both of the following methods, as appropriate, for calculating therequired subsidy: A. For Households Who Will Pay Rents in Accordance With 24 CFR 813.107(a)(i) Survey each of the existing very low-income households to determine30 percent of their adjusted income; (ii) calculate for each household the difference between 30 percent oftheir income and the formula HDG rent; (iii) calculate the amount of subsidy required annually for all very low-incometenants in this category; (iv) calculate the annual subsidy needed for seven years. B. For Households Who Will Occupy Market Rate Units at HDG Formula Rents(i) calculate for each household the difference between the HDG formularent and the market rent; (ii) calculate the subsidy required annually for the units affected; (iii) calculate the annual subsidy needed for seven years. Should the original very low-income households choose to stay beyond theseven-year assumption, the subsidy must continue for the duration of theirtenancy. The above computations provide only an estimate for determiningthe minimum commitment of funds for the subsidy account. The amount neededto subsidize the actual families who reside in the project may vary dependingupon actual income levels and the length of tenancy. Once the originalvery low-income households move from the project, the obligation to thesevery low-income households is fulfilled. Part J. Environmental Determination The environmental requirements in 24 CFR Part 58 and the authorities citedin Section 58.5 are applicable to this program. Applicants unfamiliar withenvironmental assessments, reviews and compliance findings should seekassistance from the Environmental Officer in the field office in whosejurisdiction the project is to be located. At the very least, under theNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, all applicants mustcomplete an environmental assessment and make a finding of significantor no significant impact. In the event the environmental assessment determinesthe project will have a significant impact, an Environmental Impact Statement(EIS) will have to be prepared. The applicant must identify the measuresto be taken to correct any negative impact prior to committing funds andundertaking project action. The publication of a finding and the preparationof an EIS, if needed, may be delayed until such time as the applicationis selected for HDG funding. In the event an application is funded, all requirements of 24 CFR Part58 including HUD approval of the Request for Release of Funds, where applicable,must be complied with prior to start of project construction/rehabilitation.In some instances, a proposed project may be ``categorically excluded''from the NEPA requirements of Part 58 (see 24 CFR 58.35(a)(4)), however,the environmental authorities cited at Sections 58.5 and 58.17 are stillapplicable. Rehabilitation of buildings, except school buildings, are ``categoricallyexcluded'' from the NEPA requirements when the following conditions aremet: 1. Unit density is not increased by more than 20 percent; 2. Project does not involve changes in land use from residential to nonresidentialor vice versa or from one class of residential to another (e.g., from singlefamily attached to high rise multiple dwelling units); 3. Estimated cost of rehabilitation is less than 75 percent of the totalestimated cost of replacement after rehabilitation. As part of its responsibility, the applicant must determine the specificapplicability of the authorities cited in Section 58.5, identify and evaluateresources protected, and comply with the governing policies and procedures.Such determination and identification must precede application submittal.The actual compliance can be achieved after project funding approval anddocumented as provided at Section 58.34(b). In the event a categoricallyexcluded activity may have a significant environmental effect, NEPA requirementsmust be met. All applicants must submit Exhibit J of this Packet, a certification thatan environmental assessment has been completed in accordance with NEPAregulations, or provide a statement that the project is ``categoricallyexcluded'' from the environmental requirements. Part K. Equal Opportunity Information Part K-1. Applicant and Owner Non-Discriminationand Equal Opportunity Certifications Exhibits K-1 and K-2 are certifications from the applicant and the ownerconcerning non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements with Federalfunding. These certifications must be signed by the appropriate officialsand included in the application submission. HUD will consider the pastefforts of the unit of general local government, the owner, or the State(where applicable) in determining whether past performance in civil rightsand equal opportunity has been acceptable. Part K-2. Minority and Women Business Enterprise <ITAG tagnum="81">Criteria for Selection Points </ITAG>Selection Factor I (24 CFR 850.39(b)(9)) provides favorable considerationto projects with controlling ownership vested in minorities and/or women.Points will be awarded if over 50 percent controlling ownership is heldby minority persons or women. Points will not be awarded for: (a) minorityor women limited partners; (b) other limited non-controlling ownership;and (c) day-to-day management and control absent actual ownership in thecontrolling entity. Furthermore, the controlling ownership vested in minorities and/or womenmust be continuing and substantial, beyond pro forma ownership of the firmas reflected in the ownership documents. Minority and women owners mustenjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in risks and profitscommensurate with their ownership interests. They must also possess thepower to direct or cause the direction of management, policies and operationsof the firm and to make day-to-day as well as major decisions. If it isdetermined that non-minority owners are disproportionately responsiblefor the operation of the firm, then the minority and/or women partnerswill not be considered ``controlling owners.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">Submission Content </ITAG>An application which claims to have minority/women controlling ownershipof the project must include both of the following in Part K. Failure tosubmit either of the above will result in zero points for Selection FactorI. (a) Exhibit K-3 signed by the applicant. (b) A description of the structure of the project ownership entity whichidentifies with whom control of the entity is vested and exercised as perthe above discussion. <ITAG tagnum="81">Applicant Guidelines for Evaluating Selection Factor I Eligibility</ITAG>Applicants shall consider the following circumstances in evaluating thelegitimacy of minority/women controlling ownership:1. Date the firm was established and/or control changed from non-minorityto minority/women. If the firm was established or a change made after thedate of the Invitation for Applications, scrutinize the reasons for same.2. Determine the minority/women's management responsibilities and capabilities.3. In the case of a joint-venture, review the interests of both owner entitiesto ensure there are no conflicts with the ownership, control, managementresponsibilities, risks and profits and that the minority/women partner(s)are responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work. 4. A certification by an authorized signatory of the owner entity thatover 50 percent of the controlling ownership is held by minorities and/orwomen. <ITAG tagnum="81">After Selection for Funding </ITAG>Upon selection for funding, all applicants (Grantees) must submit minoritybusiness enterprise (MBE) and women business enterprise (WBE) developmentplans. If points are awarded based on Selection Factor I and the project is funded,HUD may request partnership agreements or other evidence after projectselection. Failure to show compliance with Selection Factor I criteriaat that time could result in withdrawal of funding approval. For a project which is funded and was awarded points based on SelectionFactor I, the original percentage of minority/women ownership may be increasedbut not decreased for at least seven years after initial occupancy, i.e.,if a minority or woman controlling partner withdraws from the owner entityduring this period, the replacement partner must be a minority or woman.Part L. Assisted Housing Waiting List and Certificate Holders Search-TimePriority will be given to applications which: (1) are located in areaswhere the waiting lists for housing assistance are relatively long; <T3>AND </T3>(2) where families holding certificates or housing vouchersrequire an excessive length of time to find housing. If these two conditionscan be documented and verified, points will be awarded in accordance withSelection Factor ``Priority Projects.'' In order to show relatively long waiting lists, an applicant should providethe number and size of units available for assistance in the locality,i.e., public housing units, section 8 new construction/substantial rehabilitationunits, Section 8 Existing Certificate and Housing Voucher programs andany other Federal, State or local housing assistance programs. Waitinglist information from these same programs must also be provided by numberand size of units. Information should be limited to the unit size proposedfor HDG assistance. The comparison of availability of units versus thelength of the waiting list will assist in eligibility determination forbonus points. For condition (2), excessive time is generally defined as anything in excessof sixty (60) days. To complete the eligibility determination for bonuspoints, the applicant must show excessive search time for the size of theunits proposed for HDG assistance. If the application proposes HDG assistancefor two and three bedroom units, search time information must be providedfor two and three bedroom units. In addressing this search time issue,applicants should take into consideration any or all of the following actionsthat may have taken place over the last two years: (a) The frequency withwhich extensions are granted to certificate holders who could not findsuitable housing within the initial time period; (b) the number of timesa single certificate is re-issued to a potential tenant before the certificateholder is successful in locating a suitable unit; (c) the number of timesthe PHA administering the Section 8 Existing Program may have had to revisethe original bedroom composition of its certificates because units of aparticular size were not available; (d) the availability of a local housingplacement service which shortens search time for certificate holders; (e)any other mitigating factors that impact on a certificate holder's searchtime.Part M. Project Information Sections A through L of this Packet deal with the applicant, the owner,and the neighborhood. Part M of this Packet focuses on the project itself.Following is a brief guide to defining and documenting the project's financialand physical structure. Prospective applicants should review all elements of Part M in great detailprior to selecting projects for submission. After selecting a project(s),the applicant should immediately complete the steps outlined below underPreparing Basic Project Information and Technical Determinations. A separatesection highlights special considerations for projects using mortgage insurance.<T3>Structuring the Grant. </T3>The applicant should determine the mostefficient use of the HDG funds. Following are allowable uses of the grant:1. A one time up-front interest rate reduction payment; 2. An up-front development cost writedown; 3. Investment in a trust account (Project Investment Account_PIA) fromwhich periodic payments will be made to maintain project feasibility inaccordance with Part M-12 by: a. Maintaining the restricted rents on the lower income units for the fullProject Term (20 years or more); b. Lowering the rents of market rate units; or c. Making periodic interest payments on the debt service. Applicants electing to use grant funds as a one time up-front interestrate reduction payment will be permitted to make a lump-sum drawdown ofHDG funds <T3>only </T3>when the expenditure of non-Federal project funds reachesa level consistent with the Project Leveraging Ratio (Exhibit M-9). Itmust also be demonstrated that this mechanism is more cost effective tothe Federal Government than a development cost writedown. Where the grant is to be used for a development cost writedown, land costsare an eligible use of funds; however, since the owner must show cleartitle to the land in the evidentiary material required by Exhibit D ofthe Grant Agreement such funds will be made available on a reimbursementbasis only. PIAs for Items 3.a. and 3.b., except where Mortgage Insurance is involved,must be structured to reflect the assumption that project net income willincrease at a rate which will reduce the required periodic payment overtime. PIAs for periodic interest payments (3.c.) may be structured as constantpayments provided it is demonstrated (and HUD approves) that it is themost efficient use of the HDG funds. Other uses of the grant may be permitted subject to HUD approval. Applicantsmust demonstrate economic feasibility and cost-effectiveness; failure todo so will result in rejection of the application. <T3>Preparing Basic Project Information. </T3>After selecting a project(s)which appears to meet the program requirements, the applicant and/or ownershould immediately: 1. Order an appraisal. A basic outline of instructions to the appraiseris provided in this Packet, Part M-3. These instructions can be tailoredto accommodate the determinations below. Exhibit M-1 can only be completedonce the appraisal is prepared. 2. Complete Exhibit M-5, Determination of Maximum Rents for Lower IncomeUnits. The section 8 very low-income limits may be obtained from the appropriateHUD field office; the utility allowance will be provided in the appraisal.3. Complete Exhibit M-6, Format for Determination of Maximum Value. 4. Complete sections A, B and C of Exhibit M-1. The remainder of ExhibitM-1 will be completed after the appraisal is submitted. 5. Complete the sketch plan, typicals, elevation drawings, general outlinespecifications, and any special engineering reports. For substantial rehabilitation,the architect's work write-up also should be submitted. <T3>Technical Determinations. </T3>After preparing the foregoing, the applicantshould determine whether the following items are to be prepared by theappraiser or by a specialist. The appraiser selected by the applicant or owner must have at least sixyears of experience as an appraiser, of which at least three must be inmultifamily residential appraising. Where an HFA is providing the financingor acting as the state's agent, a staff appraiser of the HFA, who meetsthe qualifications specified above, may complete the appraisal as describedin Part M-3 of this Packet. Qualified cost estimation and management staffof the HFA may also perform the cost and expense estimation functions.1. The Estimate of Annual Expense. This may be prepared by an independentmanagement firm experienced in the field of multifamily management andsupplied to the appraiser.2. The Estimate of Replacement Cost, Section G of Exhibit M-1. This maybe prepared by an independent cost estimator experienced with multifamilycost estimating and supplied to the appraiser. Any special independent engineering reports required for substantial rehabilitationcases should be supplied to the appraiser. <T3>Projects With Mortgage Insurance. </T3>There are several special considerationsfor use of grant funds in conjunction with mortgage insurance: 1. <T3>Appraisal. </T3>A copy of the Conditional or Firm Commitment, withsupporting Forms HUD-92264 and HUD-92264A <T3>must be submitted </T3>and will be used in place of an independentappraisal. 2. <T3>Cash Requirement for Closing. </T3>Where grant funds are needed tomeet the cash requirement to close, 24 CFR 207.19(c) requires that themortgagor deposit with the mortgagee, or a depository controlled by themortgagee, an amount deemed by the Commissioner to be sufficient, whenadded to the proceeds of the insured mortgage, to assure completion ofthe project and to pay the initial service charge, the carrying charges,and the legal and organizational expenses incident to the constructionof the project. In lieu of a cash deposit, a mortgagor may provide eitheran unconditional irrevocable letter of credit issued to the mortgagee inan amount deemed sufficient by the Commissioner or enter into an agreementwith HUD, the grantee and the mortgagee. Such agreement shall comply with24 CFR 207.19(c)(7) which requires either a cash escrow or an unconditionalirrevocable letter of credit equal to no less than 10 percent of the writedownportion of the grant proceeds. The escrow or letter of credit shall beheld by the mortgagee and drawn upon in the event the grantee fails toadvance the grant proceeds in a timely manner. This letter of credit mustremain in place until completion of construction. Where grant funds are needed to clear title to the land, this letter ofcredit must be sufficient to cover the land cost. If land costs are greaterthan 10 percent of the grant, the larger amount will be required. Underno circumstance may this letter of credit be applied toward the owner'sequity in the project or credited toward Total Settlement Costs (SectionJ of Exhibit M-1). The interest or cost of the letter of credit, however,may be considered an equity contribution and included in line J-9 of ExhibitM-1. 3. <T3>Early Starts and Closing Procedures. </T3>HUD will not permit earlystarts for projects using mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance closingsmust occur simultaneously with the HDG approval of evidentiary materialrequired by the Grant Agreement (24 CFR 850.63). When it becomes necessaryfor a project to reach initial endorsement prior to review and approvalof the HDG evidentiaries, the grantee may provide a bridge loan to theowner in the full amount of the HDG writedown so that the mortgage insuranceclosing requirements of 24 CFR 207.19 can be met. Upon approval of theHDG evidentiaries and release of the HDG, the grantee may be reimbursed.On the average, approval of the evidentiary materials by HUD Headquartersand the field office counsel requires 45 to 60 days after submission. 4. <T3>Project Investment Accounts. </T3>Mortgage insurance in connectionwith a PIA, may only be used where payments from the account are a constantamount for 20 years. Applicants must complete Exhibit M-12 to demonstratethat the amount needed for the PIA is at least 10 percent less than theamount which would be required if the HDG funds were to be used as a developmentcost writedown. Also, the use of PIA funds is restricted to the maintenanceof the lower income units. The grantee and the owner should review therequirements of a PIA in Part M-12 of this Packet. 5. <T3>Non-Mortgageable Items. </T3>Once the firm commitment for mortgageinsurance has been processed, Exhibit M-1 must be amended to reflect theresults. The costs shown in Exhibit M-1 may vary from the Form HUD-92264only to the extent that allowable costs vary between the mortgage insuranceand HDG programs. Some examples of items treated differently by the HDGprogram are: land acquisition costs, off-site construction costs, prepaidleases and leasehold fees and legal and organizational fees. This listmay not be all inclusive and is provided only to give examples. Part M-1. Project Application Form This part of the application will consist of the Project Application (ExhibitM-1) and the Addendum. The next several pages of this Packet provide instructionsfor completing the form. While HUD will not subject the HDG applicationto the level of underwriting analysis completed for mortgage insuranceprocessing, the major categories of costs, rents and expenses will be reviewedto determine that they are reasonable. Substantial guidance is providedto assist the applicant in making decisions about information providedby the owner. HUD will determine the reasonableness of all the informationprovided. Projects that have a conditional or firm commitment for mortgage insurance<T3>must </T3>submit the commitment and Forms HUD-92264 and 92264A withthe Exhibit M-1. Except for differences attributed to the different methodsof calculating eligible costs under the two programs, the mortgage, costand expense information on Exhibit M-1 must agree with the comparable informationon Form HUD-92264. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section A_Project Identification </ITAG>Line 1.

(In the case of cooperatives, the unit rent per month wouldbe the unit carrying charges.) These rent estimates must be prepared bya qualified appraiser in accordance with Part M-3 of this Packet or therents must conform to those contained in Form HUD-92264 when a mortgageinsurance commitment has been issued. The estimated rent per month must be based upon and supported by currentmarket rates established for similar units furnishing comparable servicesin competing areas. Appropriate adjustments must be made to reflect measurabledifferences between the subject units and comparable units and any variationin the general level of rents expected to occur by the time project unitscome on the market. Personal Benefit Expense (PBE) Not Included in Rent_These estimates shouldreflect all of the utilities and services checked in Section F of ExhibitM-1. The PBE estimate should be prepared by or reviewed by the appraiserand supported in Exhibit M-3 of the application. Lower Income Rent_At least a full 20 percent of the total units in theproject must be maintained for lower income occupancy for a minimum of20 years. The rents in these units must be calculated in accordance withExhibit M-5, Determination of Maximum Rents for Lower Income Units. Where the applicant proposes a mechanism to lower the rent to give furtherassistance to very low-income tenants (below 50 percent of median income_SeePart B-3), the funds to supplement the tenant's rental or cooperative monthlycharges must be explained in Part B of the application. In all cases, SectionD of Exhibit M-1, in the column for Lower Income Rents, must be completedusing the formula rents calculated in Exhibit M-5.<T3>The rents in all lower income units of the same bedroom count willbe the same</T3> since the rent determination is based upon income limitsand prototypical adjustments established by HUD, rather than a market analysisor square footage.

Collecting and assembling data and documentation for the request forconstruction and permanent financing, including analysis of market need,selection and optioning of site and project design considerations.2. Assembling data and documentation for mortgage closings from variousparties involved in a project, arranging for execution of documents, andattending to closings. Ensure that only the administrative aspects arereflected so that there is no duplication of items under Line 29, LegalExpenses.3. Controlling and accounting for disbursement of mortgage and grant proceeds.4. Placing mortgagor's hazard and liability insurance; coordinating buildingrelease for occupancy.5. Continued contact and dealing with lenders and the applicant throughclosing of the permanent loan and close out of the grant.Organization expenses<T3> must not</T3> include costs of zoning changes, any of the costs typicallyincluded in the estimate of replacement cost, marketing expenses, or recurringoperating expenses.Line 33. Contingency reserve may be included only in substantial rehabilitationprojects. This reserve may be up to five percent (5%) of the constructioncontract amount to cover change orders that are necessary after the rehabilitationprocess is begun.Line 34. Include only relocation/displacement costs specifically justifiedin Part I of the application; but not the escrow needed to meet the obligationto very low-income persons who remain in the project. This escrow amountshould be reflected in section K. HUD will review the estimated relocation/displacementcosts and reduce or increase this line item if costs are determined tobe out of line.Lines 35-38. In the case of non-profits, cooperatives and mutuals, entermarketing expenses, normally not to exceed three percent of Line 39, TotalEstimated Development Cost. Other projects are not permitted to list marketingexpenses.Non-profits, cooperatives and mutuals (Part M-11) may also enter a consultantfee on a separate line, normally not to exceed one percent of Line 39,Total Development Costs. Consultant's fees for profit-motivated rentalprojects are <T3>not </T3>an allowable line item, except as appropriate to cover anhistoric preservation consultant for rehabilitation projects.The following may not be included in Exhibit M-1 (1) Developer/Sponsor'sfee or Risk Allowance; and, (2) syndication fee or expense.Line 40. If the site has been purchased within the last three years ina true arms-length transaction, enter the purchase price plus any costsassociated with the ownership of the property to date, less any incomefrom the property during the period of ownership, (Section C, Box 4). Ifthere is less than a true arms-length transaction, HUD reserves the rightto use the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price.If the property was purchased more than three years ago, include an estimateof the property's ``as-is'' value supported by the appraisal in ExhibitM-3.If the project is to be located on a leasehold, enter the ground rent duringthe construction period plus any costs paid for the purchase of the lease.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section H_Annual Income Computations</ITAG>Line 2. Include the estimate of long-term collection potential as a percentageof gross income. This figure must be based on consideration of market rateand lower income units as well as commercial space and other income sourcesand should be supported (in the case of non insured cases) by the appraisalin Exhibit M-3. <T3>In the case of cooperatives, </T3>rather than a vacancy allowance,a five percent operating reserve is normally reflected (a three percentoperating reserve and a two percent vacancy factor). This percentage maybe higher where commercial income is involved. Lower occupancy percentagesduring the rent-up period should be reflected in Line J-4, Initial OperatingDeficit Reserve.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section I_Estimate of Annual Expenses</ITAG>Estimate annual expenses for one full year operating period of the project,not the construction period. It must be based upon actual operating experienceof comparable projects, adjusted for differences between the proposed projectand the project from which the estimates were developed. This estimatemust be developed either by the appraiser or by an independent managementfirm experienced in the area of multifamily management, and supplied tothe appraiser for his review and use in the appraisal. In either case,the estimate included in this section must consider both residential andcommercial expenses and be supported by the appraisal in Exhibit M-3 orthe mortgage insurance commitment (Form HUD-92264).<T3>Only totals for general categories of expenses as indicated on linesone (1) through seven (7) of this section are required.</T3> Guidance isprovided, however, on the elements that make up each of these line itemsto assist the applicant in reviewing the owner's proposal and to providegreater assurance that HUD will find the items reasonable.<ITAG tagnum="81">Line 1_Total Administrative</ITAG>Total Administrative includes advertising, management fee and any otheradministrative expenses associated with the owner in operation of the project.If the owner intends to self-manage the property, an allowance must bemade to reflect a paid manager and necessary overhead expense.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Line 2_Total Operating</ITAG>Elevator Maintenance. This includes the estimated cost of service and repairsrequired to maintain the elevators. It includes service calls and serviceinspections of the equipment, lubrication and adjustments, and the replacementof worn or defective parts. Maintenance contracts, often referred to as``parts, oil and grease'' contracts, may be used to produce the estimate.Fuel (Heating and Domestic Hot Water). This estimate may include fuel requirementsfor both heating and domestic hot water. If the tenant pays for heat, onlyheat used in public spaces is estimated. The estimate should be based onactual expense data for similar projects with similar heating systems andtypes of fuel.Lighting and Miscellaneous Power. This estimate is based on electricityexpense paid by similar projects.Water and Sewer. Tenants' domestic requirements where not included in rent,and common requirements such as laundries, boiler water, yard sprinklingand any other project water needs such as a pool.Gas. This estimate is based on amounts paid by similar projects.Garbage and Rubbish Removal. The adequacy of public service, if proposed,should be examined as it may be necessary to provide a supplemental service.Payroll. This includes all personnel directly employed by the project withthe exception of administrative personnel. Only cash outlays are includedin the payroll cost estimate. Housing provided in the project in lieu ofcompensation is <T3>not </T3>included. Payroll data from other projects may be utilizedwhere good maintenance and high occupancy ratios exist. The appropriatenumber of employees can be determined by comparing the size and needs ofthe project to similar well-run projects.Other. Insert any item of operating expense peculiar to the project andnot included in other estimates. Include expenses such as janitorial materialsand equipment, electric light bulbs, small tools, etc.<ITAG tagnum="81">Line 3_Total Maintenance Expenses</ITAG>This estimate includes all items of repair and maintenance which competentmanagement deems necessary to maintain the property in an acceptable operatingstatus. The allowances should represent the probable average expenses peryear necessary to preserve and protect the property and its attractivenessat a standard expected by tenants. The estimate should be based on datafrom similar projects more than three years old.Decorating Costs. Develop estimates based either on employment of an independentcontractor for a fixed price, or on materials only if work is to be performedby employees included in payroll. Repairs. Include the average annual maintenance cost of all physical partsof structures and equipment (exclusive of grounds maintenance) not estimatedelsewhere. Grounds maintenance is separately estimated elsewhere. Repairsand maintenance of many items will not recur yearly; however, a replacementreserve account must be included in the expense estimate. Replacement reservesfor noninsured projects are limited to .004 percent of the total mortgage,excluding any PIA. Insured projects must use the allowance approved inthe mortgage insurance commitment. Exterminating. Estimates of local exterminating contractors may be usedor the work may be done by project labor. Insurance. Data for estimating insurance expense is obtained from comparableproperties. Public Liability Insurance should be included. Grounds Expense. Include replacement of plant material, yard maintenanceequipment, driveways, on-site streets, lighting standards, playground equipmentand the like. Consideration must be given to the composition of the expectedoccupancy, e.g., the probability of damage to lawns and shrubs by children.This expense is affected by the design and type of project under considerationand the extent of grounds to be maintained. Other. Estimate expenses not included above, e.g., maintenance of furniture,carpets and/or drapes furnished in the units. <ITAG tagnum="81">Line 4_Total Taxes </ITAG>For the preparation of this estimate, basic data is obtained from the localassessor's methods and data gathered from comparable properties.

If the applicant intends to provide HDG assistance to the ownerin the form of a loan, provide a summary of the terms of repayment anddescribe the repayment structure in Part M-2. <ITAG tagnum="81">Boxes 4 and 5 (General Guidance) </ITAG>See instructions for completing Exhibit M-8 to determine the amount ofequity contribution required. Housing Development Grant profit motivated and limited distribution projectowners must provide at least a 10 percent equity contribution. Cooperatives,mutuals and non-profit owners do not have to comply with this requirementexcept when such an entity creates a for-profit structure or when a for-profitcorporation is involved in the project ownership. Box 4. Identify all principals of the owner entity responsible for equitycapital and specify the amount to be provided. The following types of ownercontributions should be included as ``equity'' in this Box 4: 1. Cash investment by the principals for project replacement costs (SectionG of Exhibit M-1), additional loan discounts (Line J-5), interest yieldcosts (Line J-6) and off-site construction costs (Line J-8), or for anescrow account as necessary to offset debt service or to meet the relocationrequirements of Part I. ``Syndication proceeds'' are not an acceptablecategory because the owner must demonstrate an independent capacity toprovide identified funds. 2. Land equity may be included. To value such equity for sites owned morethan three years, include the appraised value less any debt owed on theproperty. Where the site has been held for less than three years, the purchaseprice less any debt owed may be used as equity. Adequate evidence of thisequity should be provided in Part M-7 or be supported by the Appraisalin M-3, as appropriate. This figure will be identical to Section J Line2 above, except where the appraised value is acceptable as an equity contribution.3. Where the owner has an identity with the builder or the architect, thebuilder or architect may contribute a portion or all of the fee to theproject in exchange for future project earnings or syndication proceeds.The amounts identified in this section constitute an irrevocable commitmentby the owner to contribute such equity toward development costs of theproject. These amounts may not be reduced, notwithstanding any changesin total costs or financing. All items listed will be included in the computationof the project leveraging ratio calculation. Where an owner funded escrow account is required (e.g., to finance thedifference between project net income and debt service or very low-income,or relocation subsidies) the amount of the escrow account included in Box4 will be computed in the project leveraging ratio but will not be countedas a part of the owner's 10 percent equity contribution. Box 5. Indicate the sources and amounts of any owner equity contributionswhich shall be made available on a contingent or ``as needed'' basis, suchas letters of credit for working capital or operating deficit reserves.In the event such amounts are not needed to meet the contingent obligationor other project overruns, the owner is obligated to make an equivalentcash contribution to the grantee (not as payment on the HDG loan) as necessaryto meet the minimum equity required (10%) or the amount committed in Box4, whichever is greater. <T3>Funds which will not be considered an equity contribution in eitherBox 4 or Box 5 include the following: </T3>andbullet; Debt service reserves required in connection with the issuanceof bonds. andbullet; Developer's fee. andbullet; Grants by public organizations. andbullet; Any debt against the project or the ``Sole Purpose'' owner entityof the project. andbullet; Builder-Sponsor Profit and Risk Allowance (BSPRA) as calculatedin mortgage insurance processing Form HUD-92264.

Indicate for each loan the anticipatedannual debt service amount (i.e., payment for principal, interest and,if applicable mortgage insurance premium), and whether the source of theloan is ``private'', ``federal'' or ``other public.'' One of the three boxes, ``private'', ``federal'' or ``other public'' <T3>must be checked </T3>if the project is to get credit for the loan inHUD's calculation of the project leveraging ratio. Loans funded from theproceeds of tax-exempt bonds and loans with insured mortgages should beclassified ``private.'' On the same line, indicate whether the loan will be insured. If the loanis to be funded by tax-exempt bond proceeds, indicate whether tax exemptionwill be sought under HUD's section 11(b) or section 103 of the IRS Code.Box 7. Indicate the amount and source of any non-HDG grant to be providedto cover costs associated with the development of the project, as wellas the value and source of any in-kind contribution or land write downto be provided to offset costs that the owner would otherwise incur. Fundscommitted to carry out activities such as ``related off-sites'' or ``waterand sewer lines'' may not exceed the amount necessary to complete thatportion which directly benefits the project.

Indicate for each grant, in-kind contribution or write down whether thesource is ``private'', ``Federal'' or ``other public'' (CDBG funds andrevenue sharing should be classified as ``other public''). The value of non-HDG public subsidies committed for project operation (e.g.,tax abatement, rent subsidies, operating subsidies and interest reductionpayments) may also be listed in Box 7. Include the actual amount of suchsubsidy if it is to be fully expended during the development period and/orthe first four years of full project operation. If the subsidy is to bedisbursed over a period more than four years of full project operation,include the present value of the subsidy payments based on a 10 percentdiscount. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section L_Project Schedule </ITAG>Provide the projected schedule for the project.

For a limitedpartnership, list the interest percentage of the ``general partner'' only(as opposed to his/her percent of ownership of the ``limited partner''interest) and do <T3>not </T3>include anyone whose sole role in the project is as a limitedpartner. When identifying project principals, pay particular attention to the conflictof interest regulations at 24 CFR 850.35(k). If a project principal hasany business or family tie to the applicant (or the jurisdiction in whichthe project is located) or if the project principal is an employee, agent,consultant, officer or elected or appointed official of such an entity,such a connection must be publicly disclosed and a written exception tothe conflict of interest must be requested <T3>prior to </T3>application submission. All information required by thisregulation cite must be addressed. The granting of an exception will beconsidered on a case-by-case basis. Should there be any question of a conflict,seek advice from the HDG Division staff prior to application submission.When completing the minority identifier, one of the following numbers mustbe indicated in the box provided on the form: 1. White, not Hispanic 2. Black, not Hispanic 3. Asian or Pacific Islander 4. Hispanic 5. American Indian or Alaskan Native In completing the Gender portion, the letter F should be used for femaleand the letter M for male. If it is intended that the project qualify for the five points under SelectionFactor I, Minority and Women's Business Enterprise, all project principalswith a minority identifier other than ``1'' or with a gender listed as``F'' must have their project role documented with an executed certification(Exhibit K-3) included in this Packet. Part M-2. Narrative Feasibility Assessment This section describes the financing structure of the project. This section,together with Exhibit M-1 and the Part M-12 long term narrative and proforma analysis, should provide an adequate understanding of project financingand demonstrate, to HUD's satisfaction, financial feasibility for the ProjectTerm. HUD will also review these sections to determine if the grant request,contrary to the HDG statute, is ``clearly in excess of the amount necessaryto provide decent rental or cooperative housing of modest design''. HUDreserves the right to make grant reductions, as necessary, during ApplicationReview or preparation of the Grant Agreement in accordance with sound projecteconomics. Any and all materials presented in the application or requestedthereafter will be used to determine the extent of such reductions. The discussion of the financing structure in part M-2 should include, ata minimum, a description of all sources of debt financing, the distributionof residual receipts in the case of profit-sharing, the impact of the owner/applicant'sintent to charge rents that are lower than the market rents set forth inthe appraisal, arrangements for a land writedown, the value of a localtax abatement program, a Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) program and anystate or local subsidy to be used in conjunction with the project. If the HDG funds are to be loaned to the owner, the terms and conditionsof repayment must be discussed in this Part. The repayment terms must meetcertain criteria in order to receive the two points under Selection FactorE-1 in the rating and ranking process. The criteria are described in paragraphE-1 in Attachment 2 of this Packet and in the Instructions to Exhibit M-1Box K-2. All projects must have the assurance of adequate financing for the ProjectTerm (minimum 20 years or Project Term specified in Part B-3). Amortizedmortgages that are paid off in less than 20 years are permissible; however,balloon payments which must be refinanced during the Project Term are notallowed. Call provisions, uncapped variable rate mortgages, and the like,are also unacceptable. On the other hand, put provisions or variable ratemortgages with a definitive cap, i.e., a stated percentage cap, will beaccepted provided that financing and feasibility can be assured (in thisExhibit M-2 or M-12) with some reasonable level of confidence for the ProjectTerm. Failure to provide such assurance will result in rejection of theapplication. Any proposal to charge rents for the HDG units which are less than ExhibitM-5 rents must: (1) estimate the income loss to the project (i.e., thecumulative total of the difference between Exhibit M-5 rents and the proposedlower rents for the Project Term for the number of units subject to thelower rents); (2) identify a source to subsidize the loss of income fromcharging rents less than Exhibit M-5 rents; and (3) include a firm commitmentfrom the identified source to provide the necessary subsidy. HDG fundscannot be used to subsidize rents below the Exhibit M-5 rents. Projectincome in Parts D and H of Exhibit M-1 must reflect the Exhibit M-5 rents.Part M-3. Instructions to the Appraiser. (Appraisal not required wheremortgage insurance commitment has been issued.) An appraisal is required as part of a Housing Development Grant (HDG) applicationto be submitted to HUD. The HDG program provides grant funds for the developmentof rental, cooperative or mutual housing. Projects must provide a minimumof twenty percent of the units for occupancy by lower income householdsfor a minimum of twenty years. If the application is awarded a grant, thefunds will be used to [Applicant, insert a brief description of the project,how the grant funds will be used, i.e., a loan or grant; development costwritedown or project investment account]. The appraisal must be prepared by a professional who has at least six (6)years of experience, three (3) of which must be in multifamily. Furthermore,the appraisal must be no more than one year old. The appraisal must alsodetermine value by all three approaches: Cost, Market and Income. The documentmust also provide a determination of land value upon project completion.In addition, the appraisal must address the following: 1. <T3>Estimate Fair Market Rents. </T3>Estimate the fair market rents forthe market rate units. The estimated rental rates per month must be basedupon and supported by current market rates established for similar unitsin comparable projects furnishing comparable services in competing areas.A separate analysis must be made for each unit type proposed in the HDGproject application form. Appropriate adjustments must be made in eachanalysis to reflect measurable differences between the subject units andthe comparable units and to account for market increases expected to occurby project occupancy which is scheduled in [Applicant, insert month andyear of anticipated first occupancy]. 2. <T3>Composite Occupancy Rate. </T3>Estimate the long-term collection potentialof the project as a percentage of gross income. This figure must take intoconsideration any varying rates of collection for the market rate units,[commercial space], and lower income units. 3. <T3>Estimate of Commercial Income. </T3>The estimate of anticipated commercialincome should be supported by market data and should include a discussionof the most likely commercial tenants. 4. <T3>Determination of Maximum Rents for Lower Income Units. </T3>Using thedata supplied in Exhibit M-5, and estimating the PBE in consideration ofthe data provided or developed on tenant-paid utilities, complete ExhibitM-5. The M-5 rents constitute the maximum rents which may be charged forthe lower income units and will serve as the maximum income to be derivedfrom the lower income units in any debt service analysis. HDG rents mustbe calculated according to Exhibit M-5 and are <T3>not </T3>to be projected to date of expected occupancy. 5. <T3>As-Is Value of the Site. </T3>Provide an estimate of the fair marketvalue of the property in its current condition. 6. <T3>Conclusion of Total Value of Completed Property. </T3>Using the datasupplied concerning the physical construction of the project, the rentsfor the lower income units, the estimate of rents developed for the marketrate units and commercial space, prepare a statement of total value. Anycapitalization rates used should be supported by market data. This statementof value should take into consideration: a. the existence of the 20 year rent restriction for the lower income units;and, b. any restrictions on value such as limitations placed on the projectas a result of bond issuances, limitations on project rentals resultingfrom additional assistance (over and above the assistance provided to lowerincome units) to accommodate very low-income tenants, encumbrances on theproperty as a result of secondary financing or the conditions of the HDGgrant funds, etc. The total value of the project, by statute, cannot exceed the maximum valuecalculated in Exhibit M-6. The determination of value based on the incomeapproach is the value compared to the Exhibit M-6 value. If the incomeapproach to value exceeds the Exhibit M-6 value, you should contact theapplicant immediately so that the project may be redesigned or other stepstaken to comply with the statutory requirements. This computation should<T3>not </T3>include the value or the amount of the HDG request in anyform. 7. <T3>Estimate of Annual Expense. </T3>Where an independent specialist willnot be used, provide an estimate of annual expenses anticipated duringthe first full year of occupancy; the maintenance and repairs estimatewill reflect the first full cycle of maintenance. This estimate shouldbe based upon actual operating experience of comparable projects, adjustedfor differences between the proposed project and the projects from whichthe estimates were developed. Consider residential and any commercial expenses(separately identified) and reflect items in Section I of Exhibit M-1.8. <T3>Estimated Replacement Cost. </T3>Provide an estimate of the proposedreplacement cost reflecting the items identified in Exhibit M-1. Costsfor any commercial space should be listed separately. The replacement costestimate may be subcontracted out to a reputable cost estimator, and suppliedto you for your consideration in making the required determinations. 9. <T3>Use of Independent Specialists. </T3>An estimate of annual expensesand total replacement cost has been ordered and will be provided for considerationin making the required determinations. These estimates should be reviewedand determined acceptable prior to use. Any problems with these estimatesshould be brought to the applicant's attention immediately. Part M-4. Substantial Rehabilitation Eligibility Test (Not Applicable toNew Construction) Projects may be developed through New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitationor a combination thereof. If a project includes rehabilitation, it mustmeet the definition of ``substantial rehabilitation'' which requires: A. repairs, replacements and improvements that cost more than the <T3>greater </T3>of (1) 15 percent of the property's value after completionor (2) $6,500 per dwelling unit adjusted by the supportable high-cost factor(see Attachment 4) or B. the replacement of more than one major building component (includesroof structures; ceilings, walls or floor structures; foundations; plumbingsystems; heating and air conditioning systems; or electrical systems).The test for substantial rehabilitation must be addressed in one of twoways: For A above, complete Exhibit M-4 in this Application Packet. For B above, provide a narrative in Part M-4 which describes the rehabilitationwork to be completed. Part M-5. Determination of Maximum Rents for Lower Income Units The format included as Exhibit M-5 must be completed and submitted withthe application. Information required on line 1 must be obtained from theappropriate HUD field office. Line 5 is to be completed by the appraiserafter consideration of the utilities to be paid by the tenant in each unittype. The computed rents are the maximum rents chargeable for the lowerincome units regardless of family size or the income of individual households.Enter the rents from Exhibit M-5 in Section D of Exhibit M-1 under thecolumn headed ``Lower Income Rents.'' Do <T3>not </T3>project the rents calculated on Exhibit M-5 to the date ofoccupancy. Updating rents using the most current HUD issued income limitsmay occur 60 days prior to initial occupancy. Part M-6. Determination of Maximum Value The statute and the regulations at 24 CFR 850.37(9) establish a maximumvalue for projects assisted under the HDG program. Project value cannotexceed the amount which would be insurable using the statutory cost limitsof Section 207 of the National Housing Act. Value for the HDG Project isdefined as the income approach to property valuation. This determinationmust be completed as part of the appraisal (Exhibit M-3). The value doesnot include the HDG or any other Federal, state or local subsidy anticipatedas a result of this application. All applicants must complete and submit Exhibit M-6. This form determinesthe limit which must be greater than or equal to the appraised income approachto value. Information on high cost factors are included in Attachment 4. If yourcommunity is not listed, contact your local HUD field office for a localityadjustment. Part M-7. Firm Project Commitments and Site Control Applications will not be considered for preliminary approval unless theycontain evidence of firm financial commitments. All of the guidance necessaryto meet the definition of a ``firm commitment'' is provided in this Part.This guidance specifies the minimum requirements for financial commitmentsfor <T3>all </T3>projects. Commitments which do not reflect the minimum requirementsdescribed herein will result in a determination of project infeasibilitywhich will eliminate the project from competitive consideration. Projectsthat meet the minimum criteria are entitled to one (1) point under therating system. More points are earned by meeting some or all of the requirementsfor Additional Points. <ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements for all Projects </ITAG>Every owner, lender, investment banker, or other party providing fundingor in-kind contributions to the project must provide a firm commitmentto make such resources available in the event the HDG is awarded. A generalletter of interest or support is not a firm commitment. For example, acommitment which may be withdrawn due to ``adverse economic conditions,''or ``adverse profit position of the developer'' or which is subject to``confirmations of the project's economic feasibility,'' is not a firmcommitment. A statement from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) indicatingthat the loan board has not met to approve the inducement resolution, butthat the project has received staff-level endorsement, is not a firm commitment.Commitments which contain unreasonable conditions or conditions which areunlikely, in HUD's opinion, to be met in a timely manner, will result inrejection of the application on grounds of infeasibility. Financing commitmentsmay provide reasonable timing constraints, e.g., the commitment expiresat a future date which provides sufficient time for HUD reviews and notificationof awards, or a range of interest rates, provided there is a ceiling onthe rate. In the latter case, the applicant must explain the effect ofincreased interest rates on the project's financial feasibility in PartM-2. All projects must have the assurance of adequate financing for 20 yearsor the Project Term, if longer than 20 years. Amortized mortgages thatare paid off in less than 20 years are permissible; however, balloon paymentsrequiring refinancing during the Project Term are not allowed. Call provisions,uncapped variable rate mortgages, and the like, are unacceptable. On theother hand, put provisions or variable rate mortgages with a definitivecap, i.e., a stated percentage maximum, will be accepted provided thatfinancing and feasibility can be assured (in Exhibit M-2 or M-12) for theProject Term. Where the cost of acquisition has been included in the determination ofthe maximum grant amount for a substantial rehabilitation project (PartM-8), the financial commitment from the primary lender must reflect <T3>refinancing </T3>in accordance with 24 CFR 850.37(d). The commitmentmust identify the amount of the existing debt to be paid off where thereis an identity of interest between the owner of the site and the ownerof the project. In the case of an arms length sales transaction, the commitmentmust reflect the amount of an existing mortgage which is to be assumedby the HDG owner. In each case, the full amount borrowed must be appliedto the construction costs of the HDG.<ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements by Type of Financing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Equity Sources</ITAG>The following must be provided:1. Evidence of capacity to provide the committed equity as shown by financialstatements (e.g., balance sheets, net worth statements, income statements)showing a net worth exceeding three times the committed cash equity, ora letter of credit or commitment from a lending institution to providea letter of credit in the event the HDG is funded. (Where an owner hasother HDG submissions the net worth test will be applied to the combinedequity requirements.)2. A signed commitment(s) from the builder and/or architect that theirfees will remain in the project, if applicable. 3. A statement that the equity committed will be used for project developmentcosts as determined eligible under instructions for Exhibit M-1, SectionK.4. If land equity is committed, provide evidence of land acquisition, dateof purchase, purchase price and any outstanding indebtedness. For sitesheld more than 3 years, the appraisal (Exhibit M-3) must reflect the estimated``as is'' value.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Commitments from Public Bodies</ITAG>A commitment from the public sector is an agreement from a unit of generallocal government, county, or state to provide (1) a grant, loan and/ora loan guarantee for a particular amount of money for the proposed project,such as a State/local financed periodic payment account to be used afterconstruction; (2) a commitment to carry out certain activities such asrelated off-site improvements, or a land writedown; and/or (3) for theabsorption or forgiveness of certain expenses related to the project suchas tax abatement or waiver of certain local fees. Commitments from publicbodies must consist of:1. A resolution adopted and signed by the appropriate officials statingthe purpose, the nature of the assistance, the amount of the commitmentand the source of funds committed, e.g., CDBG.2. In the case of tax abatement, a letter from the appropriate local officialciting the local statute, conditions and term (number of years) of theabatement and an estimate of the approximate dollar value of the abatement.(The discounted value at 10 percent is recorded on Line K-7 of ExhibitM-1.)3. A statement that the public body will enter into a legally binding commitment.Where future year's resources, such as CDBG funds, are committed, providean opinion from applicant's counsel that the applicant has the authorityto commit a future year's resources and that the commitment is legallybinding and consistent with requirements governing the use of such funds,e.g., an approved three-year CDBG plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Credit Enhancement</ITAG>When credit enhancement is required as a condition of a firm financialcommitment of any kind, evidence of such enhancement <T3>must </T3>be provided. HUD will expect to find evidence of credit enhancementfor all taxable bond financing unless there is a firm commitment to purchasethe bonds. Commitments conditioned upon mortgage insurance must providea Conditional or Firm Commitment as evidence. Failure to provide evidenceof such enhancement will result in rejection of the application on thegrounds of infeasibility.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Private Debt Financing (Except Bonds)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Minimum Requirements</ITAG>Projects must provide a commitment from a permanent lender. Such commitment<T3>must </T3>contain the term(s), interest rate and any other conditionsrequired by the lender and must be signed by the lender's chief executiveofficer (CEO) or authorized designee.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. For Additional Points</ITAG>Before consideration can be given to points beyond the minimum, the application<T3>must </T3>contain a commitment from the interim (construction) lender.Once this criteria has been met, maximum points will be awarded to projectswith commitments which contain all of the following:a. A full statement of any terms, conditions, interest rates or range ofrates, disbursement conditions, security requirements, and repayment provisions.b. A statement that the necessary feasibility reviews or studies of theproject are complete and its financial structure<T3> does not warrant a higher financial commitment.</T3>c. Evidence that there are no conditions on the commitment except the awardingof the HDG to the applicant and the availability of other resources forwhich firm project commitments are provided in the application.d. The commitment must be signed by the lending institution's CEO or hisdesignee and contain assurance that the required approval steps, such asaction by a loan committee, approval by a parent company, or resolutionof a board have been completed.e. Where there could be any question that the committed resources willbe available, submit evidence that such resources are available to theproject or identify a firm source for such resources. A firm project commitmentfrom such source must also be provided. For example, mortgage brokers whichnormally do not hold (or warehouse) long-term loans, should provide evidenceof financial capacity to fund the loan or evidence of a take-out loan.f. A statement or owner's signature on each commitment evidencing the owner'sunderstanding and acceptance of the commitment as stated.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Tax-Exempt Bond Financing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Minimum Requirements</ITAG>Projects to be financed with revenue bonds (tax-exempt securities) mustmeet the following <T3>minimum requirements</T3>:a. The issuing authority must provide a signed copy of the inducement resolutionapproving the issue. The inducement resolution must state the term andapproximate amount of the bonds.[Definition. For purposes of this program, an inducement resolution isa document which has been approved by the agency issuing the bonds andwhich states the amount of the bond issue and any state/local requirementsfor the use of the bond proceeds. This document must identify the projectand contain some indication that the agency has evaluated and acceptedthe financial feasibility of the project (this assurance may be providedin a separate document, if necessary,) and that the resolution has beenapproved by the Board of Directors.]b. Bond counsel must provide an opinion that the issuing authority canlegally issue the bonds and the interest earned on the bonds is exemptfrom Federal income taxation. c. An investment banker or underwriter must provide a firm commitment topurchase the bonds either for their own account and/or for reoffering.The commitment must state the anticipated interest rate and the amountof the financing. The commitment must state that the analysis has beencompleted, State and Federal regulatory requirements have been satisfiedand that there are no findings or conditions (except state ``blue sky''clearances to sell securities) which would prevent marketing of the issue.Terms and conditions of the offering must be limited to reasonable timingconsiderations and relatively narrow floor/ceiling terms reflective ofmarket conditions. State and local agencies which propose to use revenue bond proceeds alreadyon hand must provide the following as minimum requirements: i. A copy of the executed inducement resolution approving the bond issuefrom which the funds were derived. ii. A certification from the issuing authority that adequate funds areavailable and committed to this project. iii. A copy of the bond counsel opinion that this bond issue was exemptfrom Federal income taxation. iv. Evidence that the issue was underwritten and that the bonds were sold.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Special Considerations for State Housing Finance Agencies </ITAG>Projects with an inducement resolution (see definition above) providedby a State Housing Finance Agency and meets the minimum requirements fortax-exempt bond financing will pass Threshold 15, Financial Feasibility.HUD is still required, however, to make a determination that project costs,terms and conditions of the financing (including the proposed mortgageinterest rate), and the owner's proposed equity contribution are appropriateand reasonable before the project can pass Threshold 16 (see Attachment1). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. For Additional Points </ITAG>The application must contain a commitment from a financial institutionfor both the construction and permanent financing. If the issuing authorityintends to provide either or both, the resolution or certification mustso state. In addition, the inducement resolution, certification, and/orthe underwriter's commitment must contain the following: a. A statement as to whether the interest rate is fixed or variable and,if variable, the maximum rate and benchmark for changes. b. A statement as to whether credit enhancement is required. If required,a commitment for credit enhancement and a description of the provisionswhich allow the financing to stay in place for 20 years or the ProjectTerm, whichever is longer, must also be provided. Bonds with less thana 20 year credit enhancement are not acceptable. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Taxable Bond Financing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Minimum Requirements </ITAG>Projects proposing the use of taxable bonds must provide the following:a. A commitment from the issuer that the bonds will be/have been issuedfor the purpose of financing this HDG project. This commitment must statethe term and the anticipated interest rate of the bonds and <T3>whether credit enhancement </T3>is required. b. A description of the provisions which allow the financing to stay inplace for 20 years or the Project Term, whichever is longer. c. Either: (i) A commitment for credit enhancement which specifies thenature of the credit enhancement and length of the enhancement; or, (ii)a commitment from an investment banker or underwriter which provides afirm commitment to purchase the bonds in accordance with F.1.b. of thispart. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. For Additional Points </ITAG>Projects must provide a commitment from both the interim (construction)and permanent lenders. Such commitment must contain the term(s), interestrate and any other conditions required by the lender and must be signedby the lender's CEO or authorized designee. If one lender is providingboth the interim and the permanent financing, the commitment must so state.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Tax Credits Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 </ITAG><T3>No commitment for tax credit is required unless </T3>one or more ofthe project's firm financial commitments requires a tax credit allocationas a condition of financing. In this case, this part of the application<T3>must </T3>contain a written commitment from the governor (or his designee)or the chief executive officer of the agency which is authorized to administerthe tax credit program. The written commitment must do the following: 1. Commit the State to allocate the necessary tax credits to this projectsubject only to the award of the HDG. 2. Identify the number of tax credit eligible low income units to be provided.3. Identify the year of the tax credit allocation, i.e., the year in whichthe units are to be placed in service. 4. Cite the authorization (Executive Order, legislative action) which delegatesresponsibility for administering the tax credit, where applicable. <ITAG tagnum="81">Site Control </ITAG>Evidence of site control must be provided in the form of a contract ofsale for the site, a copy of the site option agreement, or a deed or otherlegal commitment conveying the site to the owner. The application mustalso include a legal description of the site which will be attached tothe Grant Agreement. Applications containing a commitment to convey city-owned sites, or sitesowned by local public bodies are acceptable provided that the applicationcontains evidence that any official action (i.e. City Counsel/Board ofCommissioners resolution) which is necessary to convey the site to theowner has been taken. In cases where a site is to be acquired by the city/localpublic body through the eminent domain process, the application must containevidence that 1) any official action which is necessary to take possessionof the site has taken place; 2) the purchase price has been negotiatedand agreed upon; and, 3) a legally binding commitment exists to acquireand convey the site to the owner upon award of the grant. Failure to exercise an option to purchase, or lease, or a local commitmentto acquire and convey after grant award, may result in recision of thegrant. Encumbrances to site conveyance or project development includingprotective covenants, zoning, or other barriers to acquisition, shouldbe investigated prior to submission. Changes in site after award of theHDG are prohibited by 24 CFR 850.31(f). Part M-8. Determination of Maximum Grant and Minimum Equity All applications must contain a completed Exhibit M-8. <ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of Maximum Grant </ITAG>The statute and regulations at 24 CFR 850.37(d) require that grant amountsnot exceed 50 percent of HUD's determination of costs associated with newconstruction or substantial rehabilitation of the project. Acquisitioncosts are generally excluded from this determination. <T3>In the case of new construction projects, </T3>acquisition costs maybe included when at least <T3>one </T3>of the following public purposes are met: 1. The project has <T3>at least </T3>30 percent of the units available to lower income families;<T3>Or</T3> 2. The lower income units have an average bedroom count of 3.0 or more;OR 3. The rents on the ``market rate'' units are written-down to within 110%of the Section 8 Existing fair market rents (FMRs) to assist moderate incomehouseholds. <T3>In the case of substantial rehabilitation projects, </T3>acquisitioncosts may be included when at least <T3>one </T3>of the above public purposes is met <T3>AND </T3>the owner demonstrates that the debt on the project is beingrefinanced. In order for this to occur, the application must show thatthere is <T3>either</T3>: i) an identity of interest between the owner of the structureand the owner of the project and that the project owner intends to obtainnew financing to pay off existing debt; or, ii) an arms-length sales transactionwhere the new owner will assume the existing mortgage and then refinance.In the case of an identity of interest, the financing commitment must specifythe amount of existing debt to be paid off. In the case of an arms-lengthtransaction, the financing commitment must specifically state that theexisting debt will be assumed by the project owner. <ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of Minimum Equity Contribution </ITAG>The bottom half of Exhibit M-8 enumerates components of development costswhich are included in determining the owner's minimum equity contribution.Refer to Exhibit M-1 to complete the Exhibit M-8, item 2. The sum of theamounts shown in Exhibit M-1, Sections K-4 and K-5, less any owner fundedescrow account, must equal or exceed the amount computed in line 2.h. ofExhibit M-8. Part M-9. Leveraging Ratio The applicant must compute the Leveraging Ratios included in Exhibit M-9.Instructions are provided with the form. Read the instructions carefully.Part M-10. Architectural Information A sketch of the site plan, typical building elevations, typical unit floorplans, outline specifications and the work write-up for substantial rehabilitationprojects must be submitted with the application. As certified in ExhibitK-1, item (v), the plans must reflect compliance with the minimum percentof units designed for the handicapped as required by the RehabilitationAct of 1973. Part M-11. Cooperatives and Mutuals Only All projects for which tenants purchase a share in project ownership mustidentify the project ownership during development, provide a schedule anddescription of any planned changes to the ownership structure during projectoperation, indicate any restrictions on the sale of cooperative sharesand describe how increases in rents or ``carrying charges'' and any specialassessments over the Project Term will be allocated among units. Such narrative statement must demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that: (1)the housing is best classified as a cooperative or mutual rather than asa condominium project, (2) the monthly ``carrying charge'' for lower incomeunits, including any cooperative fees or assessments, will remain at HDGformula rent levels without endangering project feasibility for the ProjectTerm; (3) the initial and resale prices of lower income cooperative sharesshall remain affordable to lower income households for the Project Term;and (4) the project qualifies to be exempt from the HDG program ten percentequity requirement. In cases where any equity has been committed, the ownermust meet the minimum net worth and/or letter of credit requirements forequity sources described under Part M-7 of this Packet. In order to assist the applicant in completing this Part, we are providingthe following definitions of cooperative and mutual housing along withguidelines for exemption from the ten percent equity requirement: ``Cooperative housing'' refers to joint control by the residents of multi-unithousing. A cooperative corporation retains undivided ownership of the housing.Purchase of a certificate or share of stock in the cooperative corporationentitles a household to exclusive occupancy of the unit as a tenant ofthe corporation and participation in operation of the corporation eitherdirectly as an elected Board Member or indirectly as a voter. Many cooperative housing projects are initiated by for-profit developerswho construct or rehabilitate the project and subsequently transfer ownershipeither through a single transaction or gradually over a period of timeto a newly formed cooperative. In such cases, the Part M-11 narrative mustdescribe the intended schedule and terms of ownership transfer betweenthe owner and the cooperative corporation. These projects will <T3>not </T3>be exempted from the HDG program 10 percent owner equity requirementunless the following guidelines are met: (1) transfer of ownership to thecooperative corporation must be completed within three months after theproject achieves sustaining occupancy; and, (2) the total price paid tothe owner by the cooperative corporation may not exceed the certified totalproject cost (costs covered by Item J-11 of Exhibit M-1), plus any operatinglosses sustained by the owner prior to the ownership transfer, plus a reasonablerate of return on the owner's equity in the project less any portion ofthe HDG not scheduled for repayment during the Project Term. ``Mutual housing'' refers to housing which is developed and owned by mutualownership of a corporation. A mutual ownership corporation is similar toa cooperative corporation but owns and engages in multiple economic enterprises.Purchase of a share in a project owned by a mutual ownership corporationentitles a household to exclusive occupancy in a unit, participation inthe operation of the project and participation in operation of the parentmutual ownership corporation. Part M-12. Long-Term Project Feasibility and Periodic Payments  Each HDG project must provide a pro forma analysis which demonstrates long-termfinancial feasibility for the Project Term. Where the grant or a portionof the grant is to be invested to provide periodic payments from ProjectInvestment Accounts (PIA) to maintain project feasibility, the pro formabecomes the Investment Plan prescribed below. In addition, each projectwith a constant payment PIA must demonstrate (complete Exhibit M-12) thatthe PIA is at least ten percent (10%) less expensive to the governmentthan a development cost writedown. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Pro Forma Contents </ITAG>The pro forma must project economic conditions over the Project Term andpredict their effect on project feasibility. The economic conditions mustbe based upon a reasonable set of assumptions including, but not limitedto, rental income, operating expenses, changes in rental income and operatingexpenses, occupancy rate, and a reasonable return on equity for the owner.Project feasibility as reflected in the pro forma must demonstrate thatthe project can generate sufficient revenue to meet all financial obligationsfor the Project Term. <T3>Return on Equity. </T3>The owner's return on equity (ROE) is negotiablebetween the owner and the applicant. The applicant may restrict the owner'sreturn on equity and thereby participate in the net proceeds. Notwithstandingany additional restrictions on the ROE by the applicant, HUD will assesscompliance with the guidelines below in the review of the M-1 and projectpro forma at the application stage as well as at project close-out. 1. For 100% elderly projects: the initial year ROE may not exceed 6 percent.2. For 100% non-elderly projects: the initial year ROE may not exceed thegreater of 10% <T3>OR </T3>the debt service constant. 3. For Projects which contain both elderly and non-elderly (family) units:Compute the ROE separately for the elderly and family portions using thelimits identified above. Add the two returns together for a maximum initialROE.<ITAG tagnum="15">Example: Project is 60% family and 40% elderly </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="38">Equity </ITAG>.....$1,000,000 <ITAG tagnum="38">Debt Service Constant </ITAG>.....10% <ITAG tagnum="38">Compute: $1,000,000 andmultiply; 60% andmultiply; 10% </ITAG>.....$60,000<ITAG tagnum="38">  $1,000,000 andmultiply; 40% andmultiply; 10% </ITAG>.....$24,000<ITAG tagnum="77">_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="38">    Initial ROE </ITAG>.....$84,0004. For projects which use a PIA, the initial year ROE is restricted asabove. Any subsequent year ROE may not exceed 13 percent for the life ofthe PIA. Any ROE which exceeds these guidelines may result in a grant reductionwhich can occur either during the application review process or duringpreparation of the final grant agreement. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Project Investment Accounts (PIA) </ITAG>Projects with PIAs must have an Investment Plan which includes all of theabove pro forma requirements. In addition, the Investment Plan must describethe amount to be invested, the type and quality of the investment(s), theanticipated interest rate to be earned and the period of investment. TheInvestment Plan must also set forth a disbursement schedule for makingperiodic payments which includes assumptions used to arrive at paymentamounts. <T3>PIA Disbursements. </T3>The Investment Plan disbursement schedule mustprovide for declining payments except when mortgage insurance is providedor when PIAs provide constant payments for interest writedowns as describedin Part M, Structuring the Grant. Where PIAs are proposed, the disbursementschedule must show that both the principal of the HDG and all interestearnings from the investment will be completely amortized. The periodicpayments from the PIA may not include amounts for initial operating deficitreserves or HDG repayments. Such reserves, where necessary, must be fundedthrough other sources. PIAs for projects with mortgage insurance must provide for constant paymentsfor 20 years. Constant PIA payments may also be used for interest ratebuydowns provided it can be demonstrated (subject to HUD approval at eitherthe application review or grant agreement stage) that this mechanism ismore efficient than declining payments. Applicants using constant paymentPIAs must complete Exhibit M-12.Where constant payments are used, any portion of the payment which is inexcess of debt service plus a predetermined reasonable ROE to the ownerwill be considered residual receipts. A Residual Receipts Note will beexecuted and the trust agreement for the PIA will clearly define disbursementprocedures. The Residual Receipts Note and disbursement procedures arediscussed in detail in a separate document entitled ``Conditions Precedentto the Drawdown of Funds.'' Where declining payments are used, any portionof the payment in excess of debt service plus a predetermined reasonableROE to the owner must remain in the PIA for future shortfalls which mayexceed the scheduled payment. Any balance remaining in the PIA at the endof the PIA term must be returned to the applicant as program income, exceptin the event of an involuntary loss, including foreclosure. In the caseof such a loss, the HDG restrictions may be released and any balance inthe PIA must be returned to HUD. In all cases, it is the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrateproject feasibility in the application submission by showing that thereis no further need for PIA funds at the end of the PIA term (a maximumof 20 years) and that the PIA payments are sufficient when needed. Thepro forma and Investment Plan must show that project income from any relevantsource (e.g., interest earnings from a bond debt service reserve) willbe sufficient to support the project after the PIA terminates. Failureto demonstrate such feasibility may result in rejection of the application.Grant funds for PIAs will be released 60 days prior to initial occupancyprovided the expenditure of project funds is in accordance with the ProjectLeveraging Ratio. The PIA funds may be invested by the grantee in a separateinterest-bearing account, or by a trustee on behalf of the grantee, ortransferred to the owner for investment by a trustee. The primary lender(construction or permanent) may not serve as Trustee of the PIA nor canthe PIA be used as collateral for the primary loan. The investment strategyand disbursements from the PIA must be in accordance with the approvedInvestment Plan (such plans are given final approval during preparationof the final grant agreement) and, where a trustee is involved, such Planmust be incorporated in an executed Trust Agreement and submitted as oneof the evidentiary documents required by the grant agreement. Part M-13. Determination of Acceptability of Commercial Space Commercial space must be self-supporting. All projects with commercialspace must submit Exhibit M-13. Commercial space is generally limited to 10 percent of total gross floorarea. HUD will consider requests for up to 20 percent commercial. Wheresuch a request is made, attach (to Exhibit M-13) a discussion of the needfor inclusion in the project. The marketability of commercial space aswell as the residential units will be taken into consideration during thetechnical review of the application. Portions of the project building cannot be legally separated through establishmentof a condominium regime to circumvent the 20 percent limitation on commercialspace. Part M-14. Determination of Maximum Units for Least Cost Complete Exhibit M-14 and submit with the application. This Exhibit willbe used in awarding points under Selection Factor E. Points will only be awarded to projects where the overall average bedroomcomposition does not exceed the average lower income bedroom compositionby more than 20 percent. This procedure avoids awarding points to projectswhere the grant would disproportionately assist the ``market rate'' units.Part M-15. Rent Control 24 CFR 850.153 states that rent control laws or ordinances passed afterNovember 30, 1983, are preempted for projects funded under the HDG program.Rent control requirements or agreements in effect prior to November 30,1983, are applicable if they would normally apply to projects not fundedunder HDG.<ITAG tagnum="66">BILLING CODE 4210-27-M</ITAG>002<ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 101-102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4210-27-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Exhibit B-2_Rent and Tenant Eligibility Determination</ITAG>Grantee Rent Mechanism1. Section 17 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and the HDG regulationspromulgated thereunder and contained in 24 CFR Part 850, restrict rentscharged for lower income units during the Project Term to not more thanthirty percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals fiftypercent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD with adjustmentsfor smaller and larger families. Section 17 and the HUD/Grantee Grant Agreementrequire the Grantee to review and approve rents proposed by the owner tobe charged for lower income units. The grantee also is required to assurethat the type and number of units specified in Section 1.01(e)(2) of theGrant Agreement are occupied or available for occupancy by lower incomefamilies during the Project Term. The Grant Agreement requires the granteeto have established a Rent Mechanism to implement the above responsibilitiesof the grantee.2. The grantee acknowledges that HUD periodically will determine the incomelimits for lower income and very low-income families. Based upon the VeryLow-Income limits, the HUD occupancy standards limiting the number of personsin each bedroom size category (i.e., 0-Br, 1-Br, etc.), the prototypicaladjustments to income established by HUD, and the owner's estimate of themonthly cost of utilities and other essential housing services (utilityallowance) to be paid for directly by the tenant, the owner will determinethe maximum monthly net rent for each lower income unit. In calculatingthis amount the owner will follow the format contained in Exhibit M-5 ofthis packet.3. Except as noted below, the initial rent schedule for lower income unitsand the utility allowances shall be as contained in the application approvedby HUD.4. The Owner shall recalculate the rent schedule and the utility allowancesand submit the recalculated schedule and allowances to the grantee forreview not later than 60 days prior to initial occupancy. The rent schedulerecalculation shall be based upon the most recent HUD determination ofthe Very Low-Income limits and prototypical adjustments. The utility allowancesshall approximate a reasonable consumption of utilities by an energy conscioushousehold of modest circumstances.5. In estimating reasonable consumption levels, the owner shall use, asappropriate, the following sources of information on the cost of utilitiesand services:(a) Consumption data on residential use of utilities obtained from utilitysuppliers or other sources (such as public service commissions, real estateand property management firms, state and local agencies).(b) Engineering calculations based on technical data concerning energyrequirements of appliances and equipment.(c) Data obtained from energy audits.6. In establishing allowances, the owner shall take into account relevantfactors affecting consumption including(a) The equipment and functions intended to be covered by the allowance.(b) The climatic location of the project.(c) The size of the dwelling units and the number of occupants per dwellingunit.(d) Type of construction and design of the housing project.(e) The energy efficiency of owner supplied appliances and equipment.(f) The physical condition, including insulation and weatherization ofthe housing project.(g) Temperature levels intended to be maintained in the unit during theday and at night, and in cold and warm weather.(h) Temperature of domestic hot water.(i) If a utility (e.g., garbage collection) is charged on a fixed pricebasis, the full amount of the price shall be incorporated into the allowance.7. The Grantee shall review the owner's calculations of the maximum monthlynet rent and utility allowances and the information sources used.8. If the Grantee determines that the calculations are correct and theutility allowances are reasonable, the owner shall be so notified.9. If the Grantee fails to notify the owner within 60 days after receivingthe rent schedule, including the utility allowances, that the scheduleand/or allowances are not approved, they shall be deemed approved if theyare within the permissible maximum allowed by the Grant Agreement.10. In the event the owner is notified of the Grantee's disapproval, therecalculated schedule and utility allowances shall not be used. Both partiesshall promptly meet to resolve their differences.11. Subsequent to the initial recalculation, described in item 4 above,of the rent schedule and utility allowances, the maximum monthly net rentfor each lower income unit may be recalculated by the owner and submittedto the Grantee for review whenever the HUD determination of Very Low-Incomelimits, applicable person limits by unit size, or prototypical adjustmentsto income are revised. Utility allowances may be revised if there is arate change. In any event, the owner shall recalculate and submit to theGrantee, for review, the maximum monthly rent to be charged each lowerincome unit, and the utility allowances, twelve months from the date ofthe first recalculation by the owner, and annually, thereafter, on thisdate.12. Any increase in rents for lower income units is subject to the provisionsof outstanding leases. In any event, the owner must provide tenants ofthose units not less than 30 days prior written notice before implementingany increase in rents.Tenant Eligibility1. The owner may lease a lower income unit only to a tenant that is a lowerincome household at the time of its initial occupancy.2. In order to determine whether a prospective tenant or a tenant is alower income household, the owner shall ascertain the annual income ofthe family. Annual income is the anticipated total income from all sourcesto be received by the family head and spouse and by each additional memberof the family, including all net income derived from assets, for the 12-monthperiod following the effective date of initial determination or reexaminationof income, exclusive of income that is temporary, nonrecurring or sporadic,as defined in 24 CFR 813.106(c) and exclusive of certain other types ofincome specified in 24 CFR 813.106(d). As necessary, the owner will consultwith the HUD field office to obtain advice and guidance with respect toincome determinations.3. The owner must verify all income, assets, household characteristics,and circumstances that affect eligibility. Written verification directlyfrom the source must be obtained when possible. The owner must maintaindocumentation of all verification efforts for at least three years afterthe effective date of the determination.4. In verifying income the owner shall to the extent feasible:(a) Maintain a checklist for each tenant documenting verification effortsand tracking progress.(b) Develop standard verification forms for all information that must beverified. Such forms should: (1) explain why the information is being requested;(2) contain the tenant's authorization to release information; and (3)ask specific questions that will solicit the specific information required.(c) Ask applicants/tenants to sign two copies of each verification form.(d) Send self-addressed, stamped envelopes with the request for verification.(e) Make personal contacts with large employers and public agencies fromwhom a large number of tenants receive income.(f) Give the family an opportunity to explain any significant differencesbetween the amounts they reported on their application and amounts reportedon third-party verifications.5. The owner shall reexamine the income of each tenant household livingin lower income units at least once a year.6. The Grantee shall review the owners verification efforts at least annuallyto determine whether eligible families are occupying lower income units.7.
