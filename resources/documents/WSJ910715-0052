Legislators complained last week that although Ms. Glaspietold them last March that she took a tough line with theIraqi dictator, a secret cable she wrote to the StateDepartment describing the session reveals a more conciliatoryapproach.</LP><TEXT>   A review of the cable and the Bush administration'sresponse to it shows that the softer approach accuratelyreflected the administration's policy, only days before Iraqinvaded Kuwait Aug. 2. The State Department's secret responseto the cable from Ms. Glaspie, who was ambassador to Iraq atthe time, instructed her to tell Baghdad that theadministration &quot;continues to desire better relations withIraq.&quot; It added that the U.S. also stood by its friends inthe region, but saw &quot;no necessary inconsistency between thesetwo objectives.&quot;   The State Department offer came in response to a letterFriday from Senate Foreign Relations Committee ChairmanClaiborne Pell (D., R.I.), complaining about&quot;inconsistencies&quot; between Ms. Glaspie's testimony and thediplomatic cables. Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger sent back a letter saying that he and Ms. Glaspiewould be happy to testify again.   Meanwhile, a new congressional report shows how the U.S.sent other confusing messages to Baghdad. The report,completed this month by the House Government Operationscommittee, says that during the five years leading up toIraq's invasion of Kuwait, the U.S. approved 771 exportlicenses to sell Baghdad $1.5 billion of sophisticatedequipment with military uses. The report concludes that someof the U.S.-approved sales &quot;involved technologies that veryprobably helped (or probably would have helped had they beenshipped) the Iraqis develop ballistic missiles and nuclearand chemical weapons.&quot;   Following U.S. threats of a military strike, Iraqyesterday provided United Nations inspectors with a new listof its nuclear weapons-making facilities, according to wireservice reports. Iraq, under the terms of the U.N. cease-fireagreement that ended the Gulf war, has provided U.N.inspectors with other inventories of such facilities, but theU.S. claims the lists were incomplete and warned of possibleaction if Iraq didn't cooperate with the U.N.   Although many details of the House committee report hadbeen made public before, it presents an overall picture of aU.S. policy at odds with itself. It notes, for example, thatin some cases the Commerce Department &quot;approved the salesover strong objections from {the Defense Department}, orwithout consulting Defense at all.&quot;   Whenever Ms. Glaspie does appear again before the SenateForeign Relations Committee, the administration is likely tobe criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. Sen. AlanCranston (D., Calif.), a member of the Foreign Relationspanel, said Friday, &quot;A stern warning to Saddam Hussein aboutthe likely American response to an Iraq invasion of Kuwaitcould have prevented the invasion and all the death anddestruction it caused.&quot;   Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) said separately that &quot;thecontents of these documents now appear to contradict MissGlaspie's account of what happened when she met with SaddamHussein.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
