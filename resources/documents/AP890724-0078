An estimated 80,000 people were killed in the civil war thatended in 1949 and 25,000 communists were sentenced to death, lifeimprisonment or exile in remote mountain villages or barren Aegeanislands.   The party was legalized 15 years ago and Greece's communists noware the only ones in a Western government coalition.   ``The Communist Party endured years of hardship because thepeople at its core were tough and held little regard for their ownlives,'' said historian Tassos Vournas. ``They spent years inexile, in prison, many were executed, but now we have passed fromthe age of fighting to an age of dialogue.''   Greeks began fighting each other when the Germans retreated in1944 and the communists tried to assert their military strength.   With British help, the conservative government checked thecommunist army, but a truce collapsed in 1946 and fighting resumed.Government forces crushed the communists three years later withBritain's support and aid from the United States, which providedmore than $2 billion under the Truman Doctrine.   In addition to those executed, imprisoned or sent to internalexile, tens of thousands of Greek communists fled to the SovietUnion and other countries in the Eastern bloc.   After the Communist Party was banned in 1947, it stayed alive asthe United Democratic Left, which was formed in 1951 and won 10seats in Parliament.   It had become the main opposition by 1958, with 24 percent ofthe vote and 79 seats, but its influence declined, and ended duringthe military dictatorship of 1967-74.   The government of Premier Constantine Caramanlis, aconservative, legalized the party after the dictatorship ended in1974.   Andreas Papandreou led his Socialist Party to power in 1981 onpromises to pull Greece out of NATO and close down U.S. militarybases, two cornerstones of Communist Party foreign policy.   Election results indicated the communists had only slight andwaning popularity. The party got 9.9 percent of the votes in the1985 general election, down from 11 percent in 1981.   ``This was one of the most critical periods in the party'shistory,'' said political analyst Stelios Kouloglou. ``Communistparties throughout Europe were losing influence.''   Harilaos Florakis, former leader of the party, proposed at itscongress in May 1987 ``a coalition of leftists and progressiveforces.''   His invitation was aimed at a Eurocommunist faction that leftthe Communist Party after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakiain 1968. The dissidents turned him on grounds the party toed theMoscow line.   Early this year, Papandreou's government was falling intodisarray because of allegations that members of the leadership wereinvolved in scandals, and the two communist groups realized onlyunity would give them a significant role.   In February, the Coalition of the Left and Progress was bornwith Florakis as its president, and its platform appeared to bedominated by Eurocommunist thinking.   Florakis, 75, resigned as secretary-general of the CommunistParty this month but remained as head of the Coalition.   Although the Coalition did not do as well in the June 18 generalelection as polls had suggested, 13.12 percent of the vote gave it28 of the 300 seats in the unicameral parliament and a role aspower broker.   Both the conservative New Democracy party, with 145 seats, andthe Socialists with 125 courted the communists. The Coalitionrefused to work with the Socialists unless they dumped Papandreouand other officials accused of involvement in banking, financialand arms scandals.   Florakis' coalition agreed to join New Democracy in a governmentdevoted to cleaning up the scandals. It was sworn in July 2 with apledge to call elections in three months.   In 1944, seven leftists were given minor positions in a``national unity'' government in an attempt to keep the communistsfrom seeking power by military means. This time, the communistshave the major Justice and Interior ministries.   Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis, a member of New Democracy, toldParliament: ``Those who bring up the past belong to the past.''</TEXT></DOC>
