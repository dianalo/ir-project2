Prices also were buoyed by an inventory report issued after the market closed Tuesday that indicated a decline in U.S. distillate and crude oil stockpiles for the week ended Friday, analysts and traders said.    Reports of a proposal by policy makers in Saudi Arabia to link its oil prices to spot, or non-contract, values of several widely traded crudes triggered waves of selling Tuesday, sending oil prices into a tailspin.    Yesterday, though, the kingdom, through its official press agency, denied it was selling crude oil at discounts from official OPEC prices, and the denial prompted some short covering, or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier.    &quot;The denial tells you to sit back and assess the situation before doing anything,&quot; said Michael Rothman, a senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for November delivery rose 22 cents a barrel to $19.66. A barrel of crude is equal to 42 gallons. Petroleum product prices, particularly heating oil, rose sharply, with November heating oil up 0.92 cent a gallon to 55.74 cents.    The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether U.S. crude, rose 20 cents a barrel to $19.65.    The proposed Saudi move initially was perceived by analysts as an attempt by the Saudis to abandon efforts at maintaining oil-pricing unity with Iran, which seeks higher prices. Relations between the two producers, OPEC's largest, have been fractious since summer riots in Mecca.    However, some oil specialists suggested yesterday that the Saudis, which have sought relative price stability, probably wouldn't take such action because it could precipitate a free fall in prices similar to last year, when crude oil quotes fell below $10 a barrel.    &quot;If the kingdom were to change their policy to hurt Iran, they wouldn't do it by price, but by increasing production,&quot; said Stephen Piasio, vice president of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York.    Meanwhile, said Merrill Lynch's Mr. Rothman, &quot;traders are very nervous -- they're still trying to get a feel for whether (the Saudi policy change) is true.&quot;    Yesterday's rally in prices also stemmed from a report by the American Petroleum Institute, traders said. In a weekly statistical update, the API indicated that in addition to declines in weekly U.S. distillate and crude oil inventories, refiners operated at 83.7% of capacity, down from 85.2% a week earlier, suggesting that there will be less refined product on the market in the coming weeks.    Continued hostility in the Persian Gulf also lent some price support, some analysts said. Yesterday, Iranian gunboats attacked a Saudi tanker in the gulf, although the ship sustained just minor damage, according to news service reports.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Following Tuesday's steep plunge, futures prices swung sharply up and down before closing fractionally higher. &quot;There was indecisive trading throughout the day,&quot; said John Andrea, a futures trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. &quot;A lot of people were on the sidelines.&quot; Prices fell initially as so-called portfolio insurers sold stock-index futures contracts to &quot;insure&quot; their stock holdings against further declines in the stock market, Mr. Andrea said. Futures prices rallied back as bargain-hunting traders bought contracts on the belief that the market had hit bottom. But each attempt at a sustained rally was beaten back by sellers who were unwilling to believe that the decline that began Tuesday had run its course, traders said. Treasury bond futures for December settlement closed unchanged after being up almost a point during the day. Securities dealers and other traders sold bond futures to hedge their positions in the cash market following the Treasury Department's auction of $6.75 billion of seven-year notes, traders said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices rose as investors moved out of the sinking stock market into some commodities. &quot;We had a lot of technical buying,&quot; said Dale Gustafson, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago. &quot;Maybe we saw some more funding because of the break in stocks.&quot; Wheat and corn futures prices rose slightly. Corn prices are under pressure because analysts are concerned that farmers may run out of storage space for the new crop. A shortage of space would force farmers to push corn onto the market, and that would tend to depress prices.    COCOA: Futures price rose modestly despite the impending weight on the market of the approaching harvests of cocoa beans. December cocoa at the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York rose $25 a metric ton to $1,838, near the session's high. Good-quality cocoa beans are still in relatively tight supply despite the prospective abundance of cocoa beans generally, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. &quot;As a result, dealers and chocolate manufacturers bought contracts to fix&quot; the costs of cocoa purchases, Miss Kaul said. If prices rise, any increased costs they incur in buying beans is offset by the increase in value of the futures contract, she said. That demand attracted speculative buying that helped spur the advance, she said. </TEXT></DOC>
