 With a flick of your wrist, see the world through the eyes of achild.andP;  Reach out and grasp furniture, windows, or walls that exist onlywithin the silicon memory of a PC.andP;  Wave your hand to create virtual paper onan empty desktop, a simulated skid in a nonexistent car, or X-rays of thehuman body.andM;Artificial reality was the stuff computer researchers' dreams were madeof--until recently.andP;  This year it's become ...andP;  well, reality, thanks to aconfluence of developments in new technologies emerging from the labs,including light-weight 3-D stereoscopic displays, magnetic positioningsystems, advanced graphics chips, and continuing expansion of computermemory, along with novel interfaces between human and computer.andM;What's most remarkable isn't that computerized artificial reality exists, butthat it is emerging so quickly from the research labs into public reach.andO;Already, prototype systems have migrated from customized graphicsworkstations to off-the-shelf PCs like the Compaq Deskpro 386/33.andP;  Within ayear, PC users will be able to design their own artificial worlds foreye-popping presentations and realistic engineering and architecturalmodeling.andM;The creative fervor in artificial reality is reminiscent of the atmospherethat prevailed a decade ago, when PCs were beginning to make their mark.andP;  Ahandful of researchers on both coasts are combining home-brewed andprofessional-grade components to process complex artificial environments.andO;Such virtual worlds are meant to be perceived not only by a person's sightand hearing but also by touch, shattering the barrier between the computerscreen and worlds beyond.andM;Exploring Places That Aren't ThereandM;Within 50 miles of one another along the San Francisco Bay are threeinnovative outposts of research on the frontiers of computerized reality: theNASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, VPL Research of Redwood City, andAutodesk in Sausalito.andM;The NASA Ames Research Center anchors the southern tip of the bay and nearbySilicon Valley to the edge of the 21st century.andP;  Here, in a building near oneof the world's largest experimental wind tunnels, is the modest lab of theHuman Interface Research Branch of NASA's Aerospace Human Factors ResearchDivision.andP;  From this room has emerged much of the technology currentlyassociated with artificial reality.andM;To experience the NASA Ames personal simulator, you don special headgear: around metal frame bearing a wraparound visor and a rectangular aluminumenclosure the size of a tissue box.andP;  Look into this head-mounted display andyou see a stereoscopic 3-D image of the lab in black and white, complete withwalls, checkerboard floor, ceiling, furniture, desktop computers, andequipment racks.andP;  Move your head to the side or up and down; the computershifts the display to realistically match your point of view.andM;Next, slip a black lycra glove attached to strands of black cable onto yourright hand.andP;  Move your hand to calibrate this DataGlove, then point yourindex and middle fingers while bending your third finger and pinkie.andP;  You seea disembodied image of the glove do the same; the display moves in thedirection you indicate.andP;  Point straight up, and the room appears to fallaway.andP;  With your feet still on the ground, you're flying.andM;The Moon in Your HandandM;Research scientist Dr. Michael McGreevy, who initiated and guided NASA'sjourney into artificial reality, is about to make a lifelong dream come true,using this setup to simulate visits to the solar system.andP;  The balding,mustachioed scientist has secured funding for a project called Visualizationfor Planetary Exploration, which could result in virtual environments of themoon and the planets.andM;&quot;We'll use visual data recorded by space probes and satellites to createcomputer models of each planet,&quot; McGreevy explains.andP;  &quot;When we're through,you'll be able to hold the moon or any planet in your hand and point to whereyou want to go on its surface.andP;  The computer will scale the environment backto life size and you can be virtually present at the indicated location.andP;  Theplanetary environment would seem to surround you.andP;  You'd feel like you werethere.&quot;andM;Using the same artificial reality application, known as virtual travel, youcould take simulated trips to exotic locales, faraway resorts, or businessmeetings without moving from your sofa or desk.andM;The democratization of space travel is one example of how artificial realitymay provide greater access to every individual.andP;  &quot;We've shown that a personalsimulator is possible,&quot; McGreevy says, &quot;but we don't want to be the highpriests of artificial reality.andP;  We need to democratize the technology becausethat will unleash thousands of talented people who will collectively developits rich promise.&quot;andM;McGreevy can be credited with designing and implementing the first practicalartificial reality system on an off-the-shelf computer system (albeit aspecialized graphics computer, an Evans andamp; Sutherland Picture System 2), whichincluded an inexpensive 3-D head-mounted display.andM;Considered an essential component of artificial reality technology by manydevelopers, the headmounted display was not invented at NASA Ames, butresearchers there refined it to a practical size and cost.andP;  In 1965, computerpioneer Ivan Sutherland started developing a helmet sporting a pair of CRTswith left- and right-eye views that were adjusted by computer according tothe user's head movements.andP;  By 1982, Tom Furness of the Wright-Patterson AirForce Base, in Ohio, had built an elaborate aircraft-training simulator intowhat became known as the Darth Vader helmet.andP;  In 1984 McGreevy asked Furnessto sell him a helmet for his experiments but was told it would cost a cool $1million.andM;A Lot Cheaper Than Darth'sandM;By cannibalizing two $79.95 Radio Shack pocket TVs with black-and-white LCDsand placing them in a $60 motorcycle helmet, McGreevy and hardware contractorJim Humphries were able to assemble the first NASA Ames head-mounted displayfor a lot less--under $2,000.andM;NASA's government-funded lab was later able to build on early artificialreality work at Atari Research, where an affordable head-mounted display, aglove input device, and educational and game software were developed butnever marketed.andP;  After the first great video-game boom went bust, sendingAtari into decline, several of its researchers joined forces with NASA:hardware &quot;imagineer&quot; Scott Fisher, software whiz Warren Robinett, and--undercontract with VPL Research--glove inventor Thomas Zimmerman.andP;  Fisher isrecognized as having brought the glove--now also considered of vitalimportance for interacting with artificial reality (see sidebar)--to the NASAAmes personal simulator system.andM;Safer Than Being ThereandM;According to Robinett, the NASA bureaucracy was confused at first about theusefulness of the Virtual Interface Environment Workstation (VIEW), theofficial name for its artificial reality system.andP;  Originally, it was seen asjust a way to display operational data, essentially a virtual instrumentpanel.andP;  Notes Robinett, now a project manager for artificial reality researchat the University of North Carolina, &quot;the real application for the VIEWsystem had to be telepresence--artificial presence in hazardous environmentslike space.andP;  With the head-mounted display hooked up to remote cameras andthe glove controlling robot arms, you've got what we call 'telerobotics.'andO;For a lot of uses, it's safer than being there.andP;  You can assemble a spacestation without risking astronauts' lives.&quot;andM;With video camera input or computer-generated graphics, telerobotics couldalso be useful at the bottom of the ocean or in handling nuclear materials.andO;Microtelepresence, a variation using optical or computer-aided magnification,would allow the manipulation of materials at a microscopic or even molecularlevel.andP;  (This technology should not be confused with computer-generatedsimulations of molecules, an area that was pioneered at the University ofNorth Carolina and is now being tested for the modeling and synthesis ofpharmaceutical drugs.)andM;At NASA Ames, Fisher and colleagues McGreevy, Humphries, and Dr. Beth Wenzelare now perfecting the next-generation VIEW system.andP;  The original one wasdriven by a computer with just 32K of memory, the second version used aSilicon Graphics IRIS workstation, and the newest system employs aHewlett-Packard minicomputer and custom graphics boards to &quot;set the standardfor artificial reality modeling,&quot; says Fisher.andM;When completed, the system will show stereoscopic images in color orhigh-resolution black and white that are generated by computer, supplied byvideo cameras, or replayed from videodiscs.andP;  The updated VIEW system willalso incorporate 3-D sound positioning (based on research by Wenzel) andspeech recognition and synthesis.andM;&quot;We can finally stop beating the drum for artificial reality,&quot; assertsFisher.andP;  &quot;After doing non-stop demos and public relations for virtualenvironments, we can start facing the serious issues that lie ahead of us.&quot;andM;Virtual Beauty ContestsandM;To see the hottest advances in artificial reality, you once had to be privyto government, university, and private research labs, but on June 7, 1989,computerized environments went public.andP;  Two firms commercializing thetechnology held demonstrations in San Francisco and Anaheim.andP;  VPL Researchproclaimed the occasion a holiday, Virtual Reality Day.andP;  Declared its pressrelease, &quot;Like Columbus Day, VR Day celebrates the opening of a new world.andO;VR Day will be celebrated every year with a parade and virtual beauty contestinside Virtual Reality.&quot;andM;Despite such whimsy, big business--as represented by Pacific Bell--is takingartificial reality seriously.andP;  In San Francisco's Brooks Hall, at theregional-telephone-company-sponsored Texpo '89 exhibit of telecommunicationsproducts, a place of honor is reserved for VPL Research's demonstration amidthe applications that will be possible once broadband fiber-optic phone linesconnect offices and homes.andP;  On display is the world's first shared virtualreality.andP;  Side-by-side color monitors suspended above eye level show twoviews of a colorful computer-generated child day-care center, as seen fromthe points of view of two participants seated below the screens, each wearing3-D goggles and a DataGlove.andM;Transmitting image data over fiber-optic cable, users in separate citiescould manipulate the same computer-mediated environment--a welcomedevelopment for an architect and client, say, with offices in different partsof the country.andP;  For Pacific Bell, shared virtual reality carries the allureof profits from the use of its extensive fiber-optic cable networks.andM;To enter this virtual reality, you put on a VPL DataGlove and aVPL-manufactured head-mounted color display called an EyePhone.andP;  You can seethe day-care center's interior, in 3-D, complete with doors, windows,furnishings, and a mannequin representing your colleague.andP;  Look down to seeyour own effigy and a disembodied hand floating nearby.andP;  To move around, flexyour index and middle fingers and &quot;let your fingers do the walking.&quot;andM;If you want to change the placement of the water fountain, reach out to itand make a fist; grasp and move it, then flatten your hand to release it.andO;This kind of tactile interaction is one way artificial reality differs fromcomputer simulations of the past.andP;  Experience the day-care center from asix-year-old's eye level; to get short, point down with your little finger.andO;To get big again, point up.andM;Reality Built for TwoandM;Presiding over this demonstration is Jaron Lanier, founder and CEO of VPLResearch and originator of VR Day.andP;  Clad in a black tunic and topped by blonddreadlocks, he is introducing the first commercial shared virtual reality,RB2, which stands for Reality Built for Two.andP;  According to Lanier, &quot;theessence of virtual reality is that it's shared.&quot;andM;This complete system would cost you about $430,000 (or $225,000 for oneperson, if you insist).andP;  If you already have the four required SiliconGraphics IRIS computers (two per person, one for each eye), RB2 will seemlike a bargain at $69,925, including an enhanced Macintosh II as adesign/control workstation, two DataGlove systems with control unit, twoEyePhone display systems with head tracking and control units, four displayoutput adapter cards for the IRIS computers, Swivel 3-D software fordesigning the appearance of virtual objects on the Mac II, Body Electricsoftware for defining object behavior, and ISAAC rendering software for theIRIS computers.andP;  For added input of body gestures, you can order a DataSuitfor an extra $35,000 to $90,000.andM;Even with sophisticated graphics workstations powering RB2, its syntheticenvironments are hardly detailed enough to be confused with the real world.andO;And Lanier's &quot;first new level of objectively shared reality available tohumanity since the physical world&quot; has other drawbacks: by the end of thefirst day's showings, one of the system demonstrators is experiencing motionsickness and has to take Dramamine before the next day's session.andP;  Such&quot;simulator sickness&quot; is common in flight training where the body reacts toconflicting sensory cues from simulation and reality.andM;Virtual JugglingandM;But the 29-year-old Lanier remains an effective proselytizer for artificialreality.andP;  Having learned to juggle by manipulating virtual objects in slowmotion with a pair of DataGloves, he argues persuasively for tennistournaments played across continents in virtual reality.andP;  Having workedclosely with Greenleaf Medical Systems of Palo Alto to develop medicaldiagnostics of hand impairment using the DataGlove, and with Dr. JosephRosen, who is researching surgical simulation, Lanier convincingly describesthe possibilities for virtual reality-aided surgery with CAT scan datasuperimposed on a patient's body to locate internal organs.andM;Another veteran of game design at Atari, Lanier may have the most vividimagination among the current practitioners of artificial reality.andP;  Whileputting the final touches on the day-care-center demo, he was also creating amore fantastic virtuality: a giant birth canal through which you travel andare born, only to find that you are the virtual woman giving birth toyourself and are reborn again and again (some of the women at VPL find thisexcessive and feel that once is quite enough).andM;Lanier consistently reaches beyond the obvious for virtual worlds.andO;&quot;Everybody wants to see Toontown, like in Who Killed Roger Rabbit?,&quot; heremarks, &quot;but how about a virtual mirror in which you can see yourself changespecies?andP;  In virtual reality you can visit the world of the dinosaur, thenbecome a Tyrannosaurus.andP;  Not only can you see DNA, you can experience whatit's like to be a molecule.andP;  In virtual reality, the entire universe is yourbody and physics is your language.&quot;andM;On VR Day in San Francisco, reporter Nancy Steidtmann asks Lanier if he'safraid someone may steal his technology and misuse it.andP;  &quot;Sure,&quot; he answers,&quot;but I can't let that stop me.andP;  I can't worry about not doing things.&quot;andP;  Headds, &quot;We're creating an entire new reality.andP;  It's too big for any onecompany to own.&quot;andP;  Famous last words?andM;Cyberspace on a DesktopandM;The current activity in perfecting artificial reality, much of it inCalifornia, is not unlike the development of the movies in Paris at the turnof the century.andP;  Two apparently opposite tendencies emerged then: arealistic, documentary bent, characterized by the Lumiere brothers, whofilmed scenes of everyday life; and an imaginative, fictional inclination,exemplified by Georges Melies and his fancifully staged Voyage to the Moon.andO;More recently, filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard argues that the two types of movieswere much closer in execution than historians would have us believe.andP;  IfJaron Lanier, with his hallucinatory environments, is the Melies ofartificial reality, then the developers at Sausalito-based Autodesk, workingwithin the bounds of realistic computer-aided design software, are virtualreality's Lumiere brothers.andP;  Yet by drawing inspiration from the work ofscience fiction author William Gibson, they too are crossing the line betweenreality and fantasy.andM;On Virtual Reality Day in Anaheim, just a gnome's throw from Disneyland, themembers of the Autodesk Research Lab (see &quot;One Company Stakes Its Future onInnovation,&quot; PC/Computing, September 1989) are demonstrating their version ofartificial reality for invited guests in a hotel suite.andP;  One by one, visitorsnavigate within either of two colorful virtual worlds: a cityscape with a fewbuildings at an intersection surrounded by fields, a lake, and clouds; or aroom interior complete with table, chair, and books that can be &quot;grasped&quot; andmoved around.andP;  While these are strictly solo experiences rather than sharedrealities, they too rely on the VPL EyePhone and DataGlove as the connectionbetween human and computer.andM;What makes the Autodesk system significant is the computer running it--it'snot some exotic combination of workstations with a six-figure price tag, buta high-end PC-class motherboard built around an Intel 80386 processor.andP;  ForVR Day in June, a dozen add-on circuit boards, including a pair of Matroxgraphics boards, were assembled along with the central processor inside asuitcase-size equipment rack.andP;  By August, all the necessary electronics werecrammed into an off-the-shelf Compaq Deskpro 386/33, offering the prospect ofa virtual reality engine for under $30,000 (not counting the VPL EyePhone andDataGlove, which add about $18,000 more).andM;Don't look for an Autodesk computer on your dealer's shelf.andP;  The company hasnever been in the hardware business.andP;  As a software firm seeking to marketthe first PC-based virtual reality program, Autodesk had to put together acomputer platform on which to prototype its product.andP;  Creating a commercialprogram will be up to the firm's product development and marketing people.andM;Though William Bricken, lab director at the time of the demonstration, won'tbe involved in the finished product, he has confidence in the package.andO;&quot;Given our company's approach,&quot; he says, &quot;you can expect a representationalprogram, something functional that will work with existing AutoCAD files.&quot;andM;Architectural WalkthroughandM;Since Autodesk's mainstay design program is the world's most widely used CADsoftware, engineers and architects will soon be able to take advantage ofartificial reality.andP;  &quot;You'll be able to create a building design and movethrough it in any direction,&quot; Bricken says.andP;  &quot;To reposition a design elementlike a window, you'll be able to reach out and shift it.&quot;andM;Achieving architectural walkthrough has long been a goal of artificialreality researchers.andP;  The most advanced work is being done by Fred Brooks'steam at the University of North Carolina, where a deluxe system showshigh-resolution depictions of floor plans and 3-D full-color interiors,complete with real-time adjustment of the position of the sun and the ratioof direct/ambient light.andP;  To navigate through a virtual structure, you canuse velocity-modulating joysticks (in what is called a helicopter metaphor),move a head-mounted display (the eyeball metaphor), or, in the closest thingto being there, walk on a treadmill you steer using handlebars (theshopping-cart metaphor).andP;  Because of hardware limitations, Autodesk's virtualreality program will be less detailed and somewhat slower in real time, butit nonetheless represents a major advance in PC-based software.andM;In the absence of a pre-existing need or market, Autodesk's attempt at makinga product from artificial reality is a commercial gamble.andP;  Who will spend$3,000 to $4,000 on a software package requiring a top-of-the-line PC and$20,000 in extras?andP;  Current AutoCAD users in architecture, design, andmanufacturing may want to use artificial reality in demos, presentations, andsales pitches.andP;  Also expected are a new breed of virtuality hackers, usingthe Autodesk program to create their own alternative realities.andM;Autodesk's product, due on the market by mid-1990, may be called Cyberspace,in homage to the term coined by William Gibson in his cyberpunk novelNeuromancer.andP;  Autodesk has filed for trademark protection, as a name forsoftware, of the word, which Gibson uses to describe the nightmarishuniversal computer data network of tomorrow.andM;Given to such punning coinages as Cyberia and cyburbia, Autodeskers may havegone a little overboard.andP;  Company founder John Walker, who initiated thefirm's foray into virtual reality withi his internal paper titled &quot;Throughthe Looking Glass,&quot; admits the unsuitability of cyberspace and other termsfor artificial worlds beyond the screen.andP;  Gibson himself is amazed.andO;Cyberspace &quot;is the last term I expected to catch on,&quot; he admits.andP;  &quot;When Icame up with it, I remember thinking that it was just too obvious.andP;  It didn'tseem clever enough.&quot;andM;But What Will It Do for Me?andM;At work on two film scripts and a novel set in a Victorian England in whichCharles Babbage succeeds in building the first computer, Gibson confessesthat he's not curious about current developments in virtual reality.andP;  &quot;Whenyou've imagined it in an evolved state,&quot; he says, &quot;the art isn't interesting.andO;Besides opening things up for paraplegics, I don't see what artificialreality will do for anyone.andP;  It won't help save the rain forests; in thatrespect, I would prefer seeing cold fusion happen.andP;  Artificial reality willjust be a gadget for rich countries, for military applications.andP;  At the lowend, it will just end up being used for better Nintendo games.&quot;andM;With an input device like the VPL DataGlove priced at $8,800, artificialreality should remain a rarefied pursuit for some time to come.andP;  As of thiswriting, only a thousand or so people have ever experienced artificialreality directly.andP;  Thousands more have experienced Myron Krueger's Videoplace(see sidebar) in museums and special exhibits, but they had little idea whatthey were seeing.andM;At the same time, the ability to plunge into virtual worlds beyond thecomputer screen is so compelling that the market can hardly wait forreal-world technology to catch up, and Gibson's vision may already be turningto fact.andP;  By this Christmas, artificial reality components may find their wayinto as many as 1.5 million homes, thanks to a DataGlove-like plastic gloveand a competing flat-panel sensor device, selling for $80 to $90 apiece asNintendo computer game system peripherals.andP;  The orders are in from Toys R Usand other retailers: Mattel's Power Glove and Broderbund's U-Force areexpected to be big hits.andP;  At first they will be rather expensive Nintendojoystick replacements, with the accompanying virtual reality software notexpected until 1990.andM;With 20 million home Nintendo systems, projections show an aftermarket for 7million artificial reality add-ons.andP;  Even with deep discounts, ahalf-billion-dollar U.S.andP;  artificial reality industry seems inevitable withina few years.andP;  And that's just for lowest-common-denominator video games.andP;  PChardware and software entrepreneurs, take note.andM;Steve Ditlea, a columnist for Omni magazine, has been covering personalcomputer technology for ten years.andP;  He lives in Armonk, New York.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
