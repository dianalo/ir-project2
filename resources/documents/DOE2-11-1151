<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-1151 </DOCNO><TEXT>Over the years, Gretley Colliery has been an efficient underground bordand pillar mine. However, in today's economic climate it is necessaryto do better. More difficult mining conditions and poorer coal qualityin the remaining reserves mean that present methods are not good enoughfor the future. The presence of surface developments at low depths ofcover, typically 70 to 100m, precludes the use of normal longwalls dueto subsidence considerations. A partial extraction system is practisedto minimise subsidence. Following investigations of various alternativesto improve productivity, a short longwall mining system ('miniwall')was selected as the most financially attractive option for Gretley. Thisunit is scheduled to commence production in February, 1988. 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
