The poor performance in the final period held 1986 growth to 2.5%, the weakest showing since a 2.5% decline in the recession year of 1982.    The fourth-quarter economic growth, measured by the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services -- followed a rise at a 2.8% annual rate in the third quarter. GNP grew 2.7% in 1985. The report is preliminary and is subject to revision.    Deputy Commerce Secretary Clarence Brown said that 1986 growth, which was weaker than the Reagan administration predicted, was held down by several factors. They included the nation's huge trade deficit, the damage to energy-sector investment as a result of the oil-price decline and uncertainty about tax revision, he said.    The fourth-quarter decline in consumer spending resulted from a drop in motor vehicle sales following a third-quarter car-buying spree sparked by generous financing incentives. The drop occurred despite a surge of car buying in December as consumers sought to beat the repeal of the sales-tax deduction on Jan. 1. Spending on nondurable items and on services rose in the quarter.    GNP was also reduced by a drop in nonresidential capital spending. In addition, nonfarm inventory investment grew less than many analysts expected.    &quot;We're still in the slow-growth channel and there's no evidence yet that we've broken out or indeed that we're going to break out,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.    Contributing to growth in the latest period was a small narrowing of the trade deficit. The improvement apparently occurred despite the swelling of the nation's merchandise trade deficit to a record $19.22 billion in November. December trade figures will be released by the government next week. A Commerce Department official said the agency assumed a &quot;fall-off&quot; in imports in December.    &quot;There is reason to be optimistic&quot; about trade, said Robert Wescott, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia. &quot;The horrendous November trade statistic notwithstanding, trade is finally starting to contribute to growth.&quot;    Another positive sign in the report was a slowdown in inflation in the fourth quarter. Prices, as measured by a GNP-based gauge known as the deflator, rose at a 1% annual rate after increasing at a 3.6% pace in the third quarter. For the year, prices by this measure increased 2.7% after a 3.3% rise in 1985.    Economists differed over whether the sluggish fourth quarter left the economy poised for improvement in the current quarter. James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston, predicted that growth could remain &quot;relatively weak&quot; if consumer spending on durables continues to be modest following the third-quarter binge. &quot;We had a fantastic third quarter. It will take half a year to recover,&quot; he said.    Mr. Wescott said, however, that an improving trade balance and relatively low level of business inventory investment could set the stage for a significant acceleration in economic growth. He also noted that many consumers are getting a tax cut this year, an effect that he said will be exaggerated for awhile. Current paychecks are especially big for many people, he said, because they haven't yet accurately readjusted their withholding under the new tax law.    The 2.5% rise in GNP for 1986 is below the Reagan administration's prediction early last year of 3.4% real growth in 1986. In August, that forecast was cut to 2.9%.    Before adjustment for inflation, fourth-quarter GNP ran at an annual rate of $4.268 trillion, up from a $4.241 trillion pace in the third quarter. For the year, GNP totaled $4.209 trillion before inflation adjustment, up from $3.998 trillion in 1985. All the quarterly figures are seasonally adjusted.    Here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:                                     4th Qtr.     3rd Qtr.                                     1986         1986    GNP ............................ 3702.4       3686.4      less: inventory change ........ -11.5         -0.3      equals: final sales .......... 3713.9       3686.7    Components of Final Sales      Personal Consumption ......... 2445.1       2448.0      Nonresidential Invest. ........ 451.0        454.4      Residential Invest. ........... 199.3        197.2      Net Exports .................. -155.6       -163.3      Gov't Purchases ............... 774.1        750.4   In the fourth quarter, the implicit price deflator rose to115.3% of the 1982 average, from 115.0% in the previousquarter.</TEXT></DOC>
