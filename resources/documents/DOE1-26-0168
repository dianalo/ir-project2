Deformationwas applied over a temperature range of 900 to 1150{sup 0}C, at strainrates from 0.1s{sup -1} to 1.0s{sup -1}, and to strains of 0.25 to 1.0.Variations in grain morphology and orientation had a pronounced effecton the deformed sample geometry but little effect on recrystallization.Recrystallization was observed to nucleate at primary particles and highangle grain boundaries. Static recrystallization rather than dynamicrecrystallization was the mechanism responsible for refinement of thecoarse cast structure. The cycle time for one pass was identified asthe criticl processing variable with respect to microstructural evolutionfor a set of deformation conditions typically used during breakdown byradial forging. 10 refs., 18 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
