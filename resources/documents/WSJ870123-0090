No one suggested that Japanese investors are about to dump the about $150 billion in dollar-denominated securities they hold, and alternative investments are limited. But the U.S. currency's plunge this month has caused some major investors to begin reexamining their basic strategies.    A shift in sentiment among Japanese investors could affect the U.S. government's ability to finance its budget deficit without pushing up domestic interest rates. Indeed, speculation has mounted in the past few days that some Japanese investors may be reluctant to buy the U.S. Treasury's new 10-year notes and 30-year bonds that are expected to be auctioned early next month.    The perception that Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's meeting Wednesday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker failed to produce a program to defend the dollar has heightened uncertainty among Japanese investors. Masahiro Yamada, foreign investment manager at Nippon Life Insurance Co. -- which has the largest foreign-currency portfolio of Japan's insurance companies -- said investors will be watching to see whether the U.S. intervenes in foreign-currency markets if the dollar again slides below 150 yen, as it did briefly on Monday.    &quot;Our position (regarding dollar investments) is undecided,&quot; Mr. Yamada said. &quot;With interest-rate differentials having shrunk, if it looks like the dollar is going to continue to decline, new dollar investments will be difficult. On the other hand, if it looks like the dollar has bottomed, it may be wise to continue buying actively at this level.&quot;    Since Japan loosened restrictions on capital outflows in 1980, Japanese institutional investors have been pouring money overseas in a search for higher yields and risk diversification. Even as the dollar's value has plummeted during the past 16 months, Japanese life insurance companies and trust banks have continued to gobble up U.S. government securities. But the most-recent dollar slide has increased concern among Japanese investors.    &quot;We're at a turning point,&quot; said Masao Tsuji, general manager of Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s securities department. &quot;Until now, we've said that we were buying dollar assets as a long-term investment. We're worried that that argument may crumble&quot; as foreign-exchange losses mount.    Other institutional investors here said that they will have no choice but to keep dollar assets at the center of their portfolios, but that they will intensify efforts to diversify into other currencies.    &quot;Right now it's probably easier to market non-dollar securities than it is to market dollar securities,&quot; said Deryck C. Maughan, general manager of Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.'s Tokyo branch. Evidence of the Japanese appetite for non-dollar assets came in the form of five European currency unit, or ECU, issues in the Euromarkets last week. Four of the issues were aimed mainly at Japanese investors, investment bankers said. The ECU is a composite of European currencies.    But Japanese investors still face something of a dilemma in seeking to curb their exposure to the dollar. Non-dollar markets remain too small and illiquid to provide attractive alternatives for much of their money. &quot;There aren't any instruments to invest in domestically,&quot; said Toshiyuki Owara, manager of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.'s foreign-securities investment division. &quot;There's nothing to replace&quot; the dollar.    That is partly why some managers of Japan's rising wealth have been so distraught over reports from Washington that some U.S. officials are prepared to see the dollar continue to tumble against the yen.    &quot;It's as if the U.S. were abandoning the dollar's role as a key currency,&quot; said a senior official at a major insurance company. &quot;This is a frightening thing for us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
