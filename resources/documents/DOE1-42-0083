<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-42-0083 </DOCNO><TEXT>Petrologic analysis of more than 400 coal samples from four general areasof southern Alaska show that the coals possess overall similar compositions.The coals are all of Tertiary age ranging from Paleocene to Miocene exceptfor those of the Chignik Formation (Chignik and Herendeen Bay fields)which are of Late Cretaceous age. The southern Alaska coals share broadcompositional affinities with coals from other areas of the world includingBritish Columbia and Australia. They are consistently high in vitriniticor huminitic components, and have variable but typically low amountsof inertinitic and liptinitic components. The coals with relatively highliptinite contents, the hydrogen-rich components, may be well-suitedfor use in synthetic fuel generation. Variations in the maceral compositionsgenerally reflect changes in the primary vegetation cover and in theenvironment of coal formation. However, post-depositional thermal effectshave progressively more severely altered coal-maceral assemblages inthe easternmost part of the Matanuska field, and also have more stronglyinfluenced the compositions of bituminous coals of the Chignik Formationon the Alaska Peninsula. Petrology of the southern Alaska coals indicatesthat they formed predominantly in forest-moor backswamp (paludal) environmentson valley flats or flood plains of nonmarine, continental-fluvial systems.They typically originated as tree-vegetation peats in the telmatic zone.11 refs., 11 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
