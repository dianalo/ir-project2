A majority in the Media General-Associated Press survey saidcurrent airline security is inadequate. Nearly three-quartersfavored mandatory hand-searches of all checked bags, and half backeda ban on carry-on bags.   Still, terrorism was not seen as the chief danger to airtravelers. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents said inadequateairplane maintenance was a greater threat than terrorism, while just24 percent saw terrorism as the greater hazard. Twelve percent hadno opinion.   The national survey of 1,162 adults found majority backing forU.S. military strikes against countries that support terrorists, butonly if the support were proved and innocent civilians were notkilled.   Opinion was sharply divided on whether military retaliation woulddeter terrorists. But majorities said the United States can takesteps to reduce terrorism.   The survey, which had a three-point margin of error, wasconducted by telephone Jan. 4-12, the month after a terrorist bombdowned Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland, killing all 259 aboard and11 on the ground.   In response to the attack, the Federal Aviation Administrationordered U.S. airlines to X-ray all checked baggage on flights fromEurope and the Mideast. The poll found support for other steps, someconsiderably tougher:   _ Ninety-six percent said foreign airlines should be required toX-ray checked baggage.   _ Seventy-three percent supported requiring airlines tohand-search all checked baggage on international flights, even ifpassengers had to check in three hours before takeoff. That is thepractice on Israel's El Al airline, the leader in anti-terroristmeasures.   _ Half supported banning carry-on luggage on internationalflights. Such a ban has been used by British Airways on flights intoBelfast, Northern Ireland, during periods of political tension.   Fifty-seven percent said airlines should be required to announceall terrorist threats they receive, but respondents were splitevenly on whether the government should announce all threats itreceives against airlines.   That issue arose when it was revealed that U.S. officials werewarned before the Pan Am attack that a bombing was imminent, but didnot reveal the threat. Officials said they get warnings virtuallydaily, cannot verify them and could cripple the airline industry byannouncing them.   The poll asked if the government should announce terroristthreats even if it gets them on a daily basis and cannot tell ifthey are legitimate. Forty-five percent said yes, 45 percent said noand the rest were not sure.   On military retaliation, 55 percent said the United States shouldstrike against other nations if it has proof they supportedterrorists who attacked U.S. citizens. The sentiment spannedideologies, but was backed more by men, 64 percent, than women, 45percent.   However, nearly a third of those who supported military strikessaid they would change their view if the action might kill innocentpeople. Only a third of the respondents favored strikes in whichcivilians could die.   Moreover, an 84 percent opposed military retaliation if theUnited States lacked direct proof of another nation's involvement.   Opinion was split on the effect of a U.S. attack on a nation thatsupports terrorism. Nearly one-third said that would only provokemore terrorist attacks, while a third said it would be a deterrent.The rest either said it would have no effect or had no opinion.   Still, six in 10 said the United States can take steps to reduceterrorist attacks significantly, and 57 percent said the governmentshould be doing more to protect Americans from terrorism.
