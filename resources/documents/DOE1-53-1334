Preliminary results suggest that whole-lung adduct levels fromchronic inhalation exposures are not predictive for carcinogenicity.Lung tumors were observed in animals exposed to diesel exhaust. Carcinogenicitywas correlated to the mutagenicity of extracts and severity of epithelialproliferation.</TEXT></DOC>
