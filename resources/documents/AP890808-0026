(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man battling his wife for custody oftheir fertilized eggs says he would rather leave the sevenpre-embryos in cold storage than let them be born to a singleparent.   Junior Lewis Davis said after the first day of his unprecedenteddivorce trial Monday that he comes from a broken home and knows thehardships it can cause.   ``I just simply do not wish to have any children out there forthe fact it would be in a single-parent situation,'' he said. ``Idon't think it would be fair to me or the child.''   Mary Sue Davis, who is fighting to have the seven pre-embryosimplanted in her womb, said they represent her best chance atmotherhood.   ``I'm quite capable of raising a child by myself,'' she said.``I don't think he has to worry about that.''   Both Davises were to testify today in Blount County CircuitCourt before Judge W. Dale Young.   Junior Davis, 30, sued for divorce in February and asked thecourt to prevent his wife from having any of the eggs implanted.Mary Sue Davis, 28, says she has the greater claim to the eggsbecause she went to more trouble to produce them and potentiallycan do more for them.   The Davises were married nine years ago and entered the in vitrofertilization program at a Knoxville hospital three years laterafter Mrs. Davis had four tubal pregnancies.   In vitro fertilization first was used successfully in England in1978. It involves fertilization of eggs in a laboratory dish. Thefertilized eggs can be implanted in a womb and brought to termnaturally. The success rate, according to testimony Monday, isabout 18 percent nationwide.   There originally were nine fertilized eggs; two wereunsuccessfully implanted before the couple's marriage broke down.   Dr. I. Ray King, who runs the in vitro fertilization program,testified Monday the seven pre-embryos are between four and eightcells. A pre-embryo is an egg that has been fertilized for lessthen 12 to 14 days.   Other testimony Monday described pre-embryos as a mass ofundifferentiated cells with no human characteristics.   But King testified the pre-embryos represent potential life. Hesaid they should not be destroyed, whatever the outcome of thedivorce suit, but provided to some other infertile couple.   Jay Christenberry, Mrs. Davis' attorney, said in his openingstatement, ``The question of how we classify the embryos is vital.''   ``I think it's important we recognize these are living cells,''he said. ``They may or may not develop, but ... we believe theydeserve protection.''   Junior Davis' attorney Charles Clifford said Davis ``wants toleave the status quo in effect. He doesn't plan to alter thepre-embryos, but he does ask that any use of them require hisconsent.''   Christenberry has tried to show that Mrs. Davis might not haveanother chance to go through in vitro fertilization, which producesso-called ``test-tube babies'' because the actual fertilizationtakes place outside the womb in a laboratory dish.   But both King and John A. Robertson, a University of Texas lawprofessor called by Clifford as an expert witness, said sheprobably could go through the process again.   Robertson said he believes there are some in vitro programs thatwould accept a single woman as a client; or, he said, she mightremarry.</TEXT></DOC>
