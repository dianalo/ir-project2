Static to ECG-gated myocardial studies are compared;multiple projections and the enhancing of the accuracy of images by computerdigitizing, processing and display are discussed. Tomographic methodssuch as SPECT using a rotating camera, seven-pinhole tomography and positronemission tomography (PET) are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
