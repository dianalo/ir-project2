CohenStaff Reporter of THe Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MERTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   When besieged Borg-Warner Corp. was looking to be rescued from an unwanted takeover bid by GAF Corp., Borg turned to the suitor with the fattest checkbook: Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    Merrill quickly took Borg-Warner private in a $4.78 billion leveraged buy-out last May. To the dismay of many Wall Street rivals, Merrill has muscled its way to the top of the leveraged buy-out business by using its huge capital base of $3 billion.    Since 1981, the major securities firm and its Merrill Lynch Capital Partners unit have invested their own cash in -- and led -- 18 leveraged buy-outs totaling $15.18 billion. In these transactions the parent and unit have ended up with significant equity stakes in the surviving companies.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is taken private largely using borrowed funds. The debt is later paid through funds from operations and the sale of assets.    Merrill Lynch's buy-out business isn't as large as that of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., long the leading player in leveraged buy-outs. But Merrill's successful acquisitions earlier this year of Supermarkets General Corp. for $2.07 billion and of Borg-Warner have catapulted Merrill ahead of its Wall Street competitors, who also are vying for a bigger slice of the lucrative buy-out business.    &quot;There is no question that Merrill Lynch is ahead of the rest of the investment banking industry in doing leveraged buy-outs,&quot; says Jeffrey Halis, vice president of Coniston Partners and a former Merrill vice president. &quot;Everyone else is racing to catch up.&quot;    Merrill's leap to leveraged buy-out stardom points to how brute financial power is increasingly dominating the world of investment banking. As investment banks are ever more frequently called upon to put their own money into deals, Merrill is there waving its big checkbook.    But some competing investment bankers and leveraged buy-out specialists question whether Merrill's success isn't coming at too high a price. They say the company has been forced to overpay to win bidding wars. And some see Merrill acting in a short-sighted manner: being driven by an appetite for the hefty fees it earns for arranging financing for the leveraged buy-outs, rather than by a hunger for longer-term profits that come from the successful operation or resale of a company that has been taken private.    &quot;Their agenda is making up-front fees on the deals and being in the game,&quot; scoffs one investment banking rival. &quot;Is paying the most being ahead of everyone else?&quot;    In the battle for Borg-Warner, for example, several competing bidders including Kohlberg Kravis, Hanson Trust PLC and Allied-Signal Inc. are said to have balked at paying more than $42 a share for Borg; Merrill paid $48.50 a share for the automotive, chemical and security firm.    Even within Merrill, some top officials have been critical of one of the largest buy-outs that the firm participated in as an equity partner last year -- the $1.71 billion purchase of Fruehauf Corp. Merrill Lynch Capital Partners -- the unit formed in 1981 to sponsor leveraged buy-outs -- believed the deal was so risky that it refused to participate, leaving the parent to complete the Fruehauf buy-out on its own.    But Merrill officials deny that they are driven by short-term payoffs. &quot;We don't allow fees to enter into our evaluations,&quot; says James Burke Jr., president of the Capital Partners unit. Merrill says it has been so encouraged by the profitability of most of its leveraged buy-outs that it is squarely committed to building an ever-larger stable of leveraged buy-out partners and investments.    Merrill Lynch Capital Partners is expected to soon unveil its plans to raise a new leveraged buy-out fund. The fund is likely to total as much as $1 billion, more than twice the size of the $402 million fund that the unit raised in 1985.    The current fund, which is nearly depleted two years sooner than planned, includes Merrill and 34 institutional partners. Among those partners are Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s venture capital unit, Marine Midland Banks and the State of Wisconsin Investment Board.    Merrill's role as a principal in the leveraged buy-out business has buttressed the firm's mergers and acquisitions department. The handful of leveraged buy-outs that Merrill Lynch Capital Partners will sponsor this year is expected to account for about 25% of the merger department's revenue, and an even greater share of its profits. By Merrill's count, its mergers and acquisitions department rose to fourth place last year in terms of transactions completed from sixth place in 1985.    The role also has brought that department a host of clients wishing to do their own leveraged buy-outs. &quot;It has definitely enhanced our overall position in mergers,&quot; says Jeffrey Berenson, head of Merrill Lynch's mergers and acquisitions department. &quot;The high profile it gives us attracts other companies wishing to do deals.&quot;    Similarly, Merrill's use of junk bonds to finance its buy-outs have helped propel the firm to second place last year in terms of market share, up from eighth place in 1985, Merrill says. And Merrill has arranged more &quot;bridge loans&quot; -- short-term loans using the investment bank's own cash -- than any of its Wall Street rivals.    The decision to raise another fund stirred up debate within Merrill Lynch. It wasn't that top Merrill brass didn't favor continuing in the buy-out business. But some were in favor of Merrill going it alone, without partners.    &quot;The returns were so attractive that a couple of top Merrill executives thought, 'Why not put more of our capital into this business and keep the profits for ourselves?'&quot; says one Merrill executive.    Indeed, the handful of companies that Merrill Lynch has sold have yielded hefty returns to Merrill and its partners. Denny's Inc. recently was sold for $220 million, more than quadruple the $45 million equity investment made in January 1985. Signode Corp. was sold last year for $278 million, ten times the $27.5 million equity investment made in 1982.    Capital Partners' Mr. Burke says Merrill Lynch seeks 40% annual returns on the companies it acquires. The unit aims to sell or spin off its acquisitions within five years. &quot;We've not had one company that's had anything close to a problem from a financial point of view,&quot; Mr. Burke says.    That is largely confirmed by interviews with partners, who say they generally are pleased with the progress of the Capital Partners acquisitions. &quot;There is only one (acquisition) that Merrill feels uncomfortable with,&quot; says Robert L. Zobel, the director of investments for the State of Wisconsin, and one of Merrill's largest partners. That one, which Mr. Zobel declines to name, &quot;is a wash,&quot; he adds.    But most leveraged buy-outs done by Merrill and others in the past five years have fared well, reflecting a buoyant economy and low interest rates. The real test of Merrill's leveraged buy-out business, competitors and buy-out experts say, will come if the economy sours and rates rise.    A look at the recent Merrill Lynch Capital Partners transaction for Supermarkets General illustrates the risks and rewards of Merrill's buy-out business. Seeking to fend off a hostile bid by Dart Group Corp., Supermarkets General, a Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer, agreed to be taken private by a group led by Capital Partners.    To finance the bid, the Merrill unit borrowed $870 million from banks and $225 million from Equitable Life, and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. temporarily lent $375 million of its own money. The buy-out group, which includes members of Supermarkets management and Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, put only $100 milllion of equity into the transaction; Merrill Lynch Capital Partners contributed about $55 million of that total.    Merrill's greatest risk in Supermarkets is the $375 million the firm put up in June as a short-term bridge loan. It plans to recover that money within 90 to 120 days by selling to the public $475 million of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds.    If interest rates move up sharply in that time, Merrill could have a tough time selling the bonds and paying itself back. It also could have trouble completing another necessary step -- selling off some of Supermarket's assets.    Raymond Minella, head of Merrill's junk bond department, acknowledges that &quot;the ramifications if you can't sell the securities are significant.&quot; But he says that Merrill has contingency plans for such a problem. &quot;We could take fees we've gotten for bridge financing and pay (junk bond) buyers commitment (fees) to lock up the rates,&quot; he says. The bonds also could be marketed privately to institutional investors, although this would mean Supermarkets paying higher rates.    For the buy-out to be successful, cash flow at Supermarkets must remain strong so that the company can pay down its massive debt load on time. In the early years, the repayment will be done largely with money earned from the sale of assets. Later on, debt payments will come from the company's cash flow.    But even if the company were to founder, Merrill already would have earned a total of about $52 million in investment banking fees for providing the bridge loan, completing the tender offer and selling the junk bonds and other securities for Supermarkets. And that doesn't include fees Merrill will earn for arranging any asset sales. The $52 million is more than nine times Merrill's total equity investment in Supermarkets of $5.5 million; the remainder comes from Merrill's partners in the fund and from Supermarkets management.    Capital Partners has been careful to diversify its portfolio with companies like Supermarkets, which it believes aren't likely to be vulnerable to economic downturns. The unit's discretion was reflected in its decision to pass on the parent's bid last year for Fruehauf.    Because most of the money that Capital Partners invests doesn't belong to Merrill Lynch, the unit maintains autonomy in deciding what companies to acquire. However, the unit won't pursue a transaction in which the parent is representing either the target or another bidder.    &quot;The returns didn't meet (Merrill Lynch Capital Partners) guidelines,&quot; explains Barry Friedberg, head of investment banking at Merrill.    However, Merrill Lynch, which had been hired by Fruehauf to defend the company against a hostile takeover bid by New York investor Asher B. Edelman, denies there is a problem with Fruehauf.    But public documents available on Fruehauf indicate that the company's earnings are far behind projections. For this year, Fruehauf executives forecast earnings of $268 million. But with a net loss for the first six months of $15.4 million, and continuing softness in the trailer and container businesses -- Fruehauf's principal lines -- the company will have a lot of catching up to do if it wishes to meet its forecasts.    Still, even if Fruehauf were to run into serious problems, Merrill itself wouldn't be hurt financially. For its $10.5 million equity investment, it already has earned more than $40 million in fees.    If Fruehauf finds rough sledding ahead, &quot;Everyone but Merrill will feel the crunch,&quot; says one Fruehauf bondholder.    ---             Merrill-Sponsored Leveraged Buy-Outs                   (In millions of dollars) CLOSING            COMPANY                     TRANSACTION DATE               (Seller)                         VALUE* 10/81  Industrial Products Group (Gould Inc.)         $385  3/82  Converse Inc.
