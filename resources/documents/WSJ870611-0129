The government efforts, involving the Finance Ministry's request last month for a halt in excessive dollar-selling and its subsequent move to tighten currency position reporting requirements on various financial concerns have become &quot;boneless,&quot; one senior trader said. Another at a different bank said, &quot;The effect of the move was overrated in the beginning, anyway.&quot;    In an unusual move, the Finance Ministry May 13 summoned chief executives of banks, securities houses, insurance companies and others, both Japanese and foreign, to show its displeasure over what it considered sometimes excessive dollar-selling by those financial institutions. The &quot;humble request,&quot; as ministry officials called it at the time, turned to arm-twisting a week later as the ministry asked them to report their day-to-day currency positions once a week.    The market initially reacted with caution. Many cited the Finance Ministry moves as among major factors behind the dollar's recovery from below 140 yen to 144 yen in late May.    Senior traders now say, however, that the market may have overreacted to the ministry's actions.    &quot;Banks' currency positions have been restricted (by the government) anyway,&quot; one of the traders said. &quot;We don't especially consider it a source of extra burden to report to the Finance Ministry about our positions.&quot;    Said the other, &quot;Everybody appeared cautious initially about selling, but these days people are selling dollars without giving much thought to what the Finance Ministry will think about it. When we have to sell, we sell.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
