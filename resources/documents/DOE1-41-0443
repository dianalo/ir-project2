The petroleum samples, containing approximately1 ppm I, are heavy, highly viscous residues left from high temperaturedistillations. The method is a solvent extraction using toluene as thesolvent, and sodium biphenyl as an organic halogen reagent. Iodine isextracted with up to 90% efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
