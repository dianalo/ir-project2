As many as eight positions will be cut immediately, thecompany said, followed by reductions in the division'ssupport staff, to be announced during the next six months.The firm's institutional accounts will be absorbed by itsteam of 15 retail brokers, which will remain intact. MorganStanley Asia is the Hong Kong subsidiary of New York-basedMorgan Stanley Group.</LP><TEXT>   The staff cuts, discussed by Morgan Stanley officials inboth Hong Kong and New York for about a year, were motivatedprimarily by sluggish overseas interest in Hong Kong andother Asian-Pacific stock markets, said managing directorAndrew Liu. &quot;We have found that since we've been in HongKong, the size of the infrastructure of our back office isnot supported by the volume we've seen, especially in officesoutside Japan,&quot; Mr. Liu said.   The cuts follow by less than a month wider cuts by NewYork-based Bankers Trust Corp., which closed its Hong Kongbrokerage operations at the expense of 46 employees. BankersTrust officials cited low trading volume on the Hong Kongstock market as the reason.   Mr. Liu said the closure of Morgan Stanley's Hong Konginstitutional sales arm will have no effect on its merchant-and investment-banking services offered through offices inTokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei and Singapore. He added that MorganStanley Asia will continue to underwrite new share listingson regional markets through its retail sales staff, and willremain active in the region's derivative-products markets.   &quot;We will continue to solicit issue mandates veryaggressively,&quot; he said. &quot;We remain fully committed toSoutheast Asia and Hong Kong, which we believe has a lot ofpotential.&quot;   The cuts also will have no effect on Morgan Stanley'sconsultancy role in Hong Kong's proposed airport and seaportproject, which at an estimated cost of HK$127 billion(US$16.3 billion) is considered the lynchpin to the colony'sfuture as a transportation hub, according to Mr. Liu.   Morgan Stanley Asia established its institutional salesstaff in July 1988 as part of an aggressive East Asianexpansion plan. Nonetheless, the sales team was focusedprimarily on selling Asian shares to fund managers in NewYork and devoted much of its resources to market-making forthe company's in-house portfolio.   Although most analysts weren't surprised by the firm'smove, they said it could herald staff reductions at othersecurities firms in the British colony. Hong Kong's brokeragecommunity has been slowly winnowed by a downturn in tradingvolume on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong since the TiananmenSquare killings in Beijing in June 1989. The current Mideastcrisis has contributed to the downturn as well.   Brokers said reduced volume will wear most heavily onsmall, local firms and subsidiaries of internationalcompanies that established Asian operations only recently.   &quot;It all depends on whether you're committed or not,&quot; saidJames Osborn, a broker with Baring Securities (Hong Kong)Ltd. &quot;If you've been around, you know there's going to besome good times along with the bad.&quot;   The firms that are having trouble, he said, &quot;are the oneswho were building a house during the boom years, but neverhad time to put up a roof first before we entered this slowperiod.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
