The bank financing, being raised by Hanson's U.S. arm, isexpected to come together this week, an indication that bankloans are available for highly leveraged merger transactionsafter a yearlong drought, according to bankers close to thetalks. By regulatory definition, highly leveraged loans arefinance transactions where the borrower would end up with adebt-to-equity ratio of 75% or higher.</LP><TEXT>   The funds will be used for the $2 billion friendly bidmade Sept. 16 by Hanson PLC, a British industrialconglomerate, for U.K.-based construction group Beazer, whichhas extensive operations in the U.S. The $4 billion loansought by Hanson's U.S. subsidiary includes funds for therefinancing of some existing debt, say bankers.   A bank syndicate led by Chemical Banking Corp., Citicorp,Toronto Dominion Bank, Banque Paribas and Swiss Bank Corp. isexpected to underwrite the bank facility, which will be aso-called highly leveraged transaction for regulatorypurposes, bankers with knowledge of the talks said. Aspokesman for Hanson Industries, the Iselin, N.J.-based U.S.arm that is arranging the loan, declined to comment.   &quot;There's capital available for strategic acquisitions orwell-financed financial players,&quot; said Rick Sobrovinas, headof leveraged finance at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. Mr. Sobrovinassays commercial banks are willing to finance companies &quot;thatcan reach down for new money in case the projections are notmet.&quot;   Leveraged transactions crafted in the 1980s that are beingrecast with fresh equity are also raising new money. YorkInternational Corp., which is readying an initial publicoffering after being taken private in 1988, found such strongdemand for a new $500 million credit line that it was able toraise that and an additional $150 million in bank lines lastmonth.   &quot;It looks like banks are a little hungrier,&quot; said StevenMiller, an analyst at Loan Pricing Corp.   But the loans for Hanson, as well as the expansion to $15billion from $12 billion of a Philip Morris Co. credit linethis month, carry higher interest rates and fees thanprevious financings. Banks are seeking additionalcompensation to bolster profit margins while paying for thecost of bad loans.   For example, Hanson paid 0.50% over the benchmark Londoninterbank offered rate, or Libor, for a $2.6 billionfinancing last year for the acquisition of Peabody Coal Co.Although terms haven't been finalized, the company is seekingan interest rate of 0.75% over Libor for the new financing,bankers say.   In fact, net interest margins, the profits earned from thedifferential between banks' cost of funds and the ratescharged, are at historically wide levels of about 3.80% forlarge banks, Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. estimated.   For a highly leveraged transaction, the Hanson deal is avery low interest rate, though. A typical highly leveragedtransaction carries interest rates of 2% to 2.5% over Libor.   But Hanson, like Philip Morris or American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Corp., which recently raised $8 billion for itsacquisition of NCR Corp., is a blue-chip world-class creditthat banks finance at cheap rates to snag other business.(The Philip Morris and ATandamp;T transactions aren't consideredhighly leveraged transactions for regulatory purposes.) Andeven though Hanson Industries has a negative tangible networth, lenders say they assume its parent would step in ifthere were problems.   &quot;Many banks will do it to maintain relationships withHanson PLC,&quot; one of the company's lenders said.   Moreover, there is more room for highly leveragedtransactions on banks' balance sheets because many havereduced their exposure to them in the last year withoutbooking new loans. Citicorp, for instance, has reduced highlyleveraged deals on its books by 15.5% this year to about $6billion. There have only been a handful of highly leveragedtransactions in 1991.   The financing would rank as the largest highly leveragedtransaction since Time Warner Inc.'s $11 billion refinancingof debt raised in late 1989 for Time Inc.'s acquisition ofWarner Communications, according to Loan Pricing Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
