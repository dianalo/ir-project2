JansonandM;It keeps on running.andM;That's what Intel Corp. officials say about any battery-powered 386SL-basedsystem that takes advantage of the Intel microprocessor's power-managementcapability.andM;That aspect of the chip &quot;transfers power-management worries from the user tothe computer,&quot; said Jim Chapman, director of Intel's Entry Products Group, inSanta Clara, Calif.andM;In essence, Intel's 386SL microprocessor expands the 386 architecture toinclude new power features.andP;  This expansion, called the System ManagementMode, reduces a system's overall drain on the battery.andM;According to Intel officials, a notebook PC using the 386SL can have longerbattery life, be lighter in weight and contain peripherals that use morepower than is feasible with portable PCs using most other processors.andM;&quot;The key is that the user will be able to use this andlsqb;portableandrsqb; all day withoutrecharging the battery,&quot; Chapman said.andM;The 386SL CPU at 25MHz is 25 percent faster (5.3 million instructions persecond) than Intel's existing 20MHz chip and has a fully static,high-integration, system-management architecture.andP;  The 386SL allows powermanagement to function under Windows and OS/2.andM;According to Intel officials, the 386SL's power-management architectureallows the battery to run as much as 50 percent longer than with otherprocessors.andM;While CPU demands are responsible for just 20 percent of a system's batterydrain, the power-management architecture controls the remaining 80 percent ofthe system power consumption driven by the hard disk, display and othercomponents.andM;At least half of the computer market will be dominated by portable computersby 1994 or 1995, Chapman said, citing studies done by market-research firmssuch as Dataquest Inc., of San Jose, Calif.andM;Intel officials predict that by the end of 1992, shipments of SL-basedportables will outnumber those of 386SX portables.andM;With the 386SL's development, users aren't as much at the mercy of theirmachines, and they don't have to worry as much about data if the system losespower.andM;&quot;A regular user can do a coast-to-coast flight&quot; without the battery runningout, Chapman said.andM;Currently, the 25MHz version of the 386SL chip is priced at $189 inquantities of 1,000, with that price expected to drop in 1992.andP;  Its 20MHzsibling costs $135 per 1,000, which is a drop from its 1990 introductoryprice of $176 per 1,000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
