According to proxy materials mailed to shareholdersFriday, MCA will ask holders to approve the company's firststock-option plan in a generation, a plan that calls for theissue of five million new shares. The only beneficiary of theplan so far is Mr. Pollock, who would receive options to buy600,000 shares at an exercise price of $55 a share, whichwere valued at $68 a share at the time they were awarded lastAugust.</LP><TEXT>   But the shares closed at $51 a share Friday, so theywouldn't be worth anything today. Mr. Pollock may exercisethe options in 20% yearly increments beginning in July.   In addition, Mr. Pollock receives a salary increase to$850,000 a year, from $636,692, as part of a new five-yearcontract signed last year. He also receives 95,000 shares ofstock worth $5.7 million, and will receive 150,000 moreshares during the next two years. Company Chairman LewWasserman receives a salary increase to $900,000 a year, from$559,000, while President Sidney Sheinberg, goes to $900,000a year from $729,000.   Mr. Sheinberg also received stock valued at $7.3 million.   MCA, with Hollywood's most long-serving management team byfar, has always been relatively conservative about executivecompensation. A stock option plan was adopted by shareholdersin 1968, but never exercised, and though an incentive stockplan for executives has existed since 1975, the new &quot;stockawards plan&quot; breaks new ground.   Proxy materials argue that the plan is for &quot;attracting andretaining executive personnel, motivating executive personnelby means of growth-related incentives {and} providingincentive compensation opportunities that are competitivewith those of other major corporations.&quot;   These other corporations include Walt Disney Co., whosechairman Michael Eisner's salary, bonus and options totaledabout $40 million in fiscal 1988. Disney President FrankWells realized $72.4 million from the sale of stock boughtthrough options in 1989, and former Chief Financial OfficerGary L. Wilson exercised options valued at $47.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
