ChipelloStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPANTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> TOKYO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Minebea Co., a maverick ball-bearing manufacturer known for aggressive growth tactics, started plotting an acquisition in 1985 that was heralded as Japan's first hostile takeover.    Soon, however, Minebea itself became the target of an unfriendly takeover attempt in a bizarre episode involving another taboo: foreign raiders. Minebea drove off the alien assault from Trafalgar Holdings Ltd. of the U.S. and Britain's Glen International PLC.    Now Minebea is back to stalking its own prey. It wants to acquire all of Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co., the world's largest maker of music boxes, over the adamant opposition of that company's management. Sankyo Seiki won't even talk with Minebea, its largest stockholder with 18% of shares outstanding.    The standoff illustrates that, while attitudes about corporate takeovers may be changing, Japan's corporate culture still eschews open hostilities that are commonplace in the West. Investment bankers don't recall a single merger here in which both sides didn't embrace in the end.    Yet Japanese companies are undoubtedly gaining sophistication when it comes to aggressive takeovers on foreign territory. The $550 million purchase of Sun Chemical Corp.'s graphic-arts division last year by Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals Inc. -- or its recent $473 million hostile attempt on another U.S. concern, Reichhold Chemicals Inc. -- could herald a new wave.    But at home, corporate behavior remains genteel. If there is dirty work to do, it is done by speculator groups that quietly buy up shares in the market and serve as intermediaries.    Actually, mergers aren't uncommon in Japan; Sanwa Bank counts about a thousand annually in recent years. But acquisitions of listed companies are relatively few, and successful mergers generally follow years of tight business relationships or precede a bankruptcy. Tender offers are allowed under Japan's securities laws, but since World War II the tactic has been used only two times -- both friendly.    &quot;Nobody's sure how you fill out the form for a tender offer and submit it to the government,&quot; says Jun Imanishi, head of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s mergers-and-acquisitions team in Tokyo. &quot;People talk about a mergers-and-acquisitions boom hitting Japan, but we haven't seen any drastic changes in the way things are done.&quot;    A big damper on such activity is the reluctance to abandon traditional social contracts. A company is held in trust to be passed on to the next generation, not sold for profit. Corporate takeovers are loathed -- and widely described with the same word used for hijacking: &quot;nottori.&quot;    As such, foreign companies shopping for acquisitions in Japan face major difficulties. Japanese shares are thought to be overvalued, with average price-earnings ratios more than triple those in the U.S.; the high yen makes buying them even more prohibitive. (The P-E ratio, the share price divided by earnings per share for a 12-month period, is a common way to assess a stock's underlying value.) Even when enough shares are obtained, the foreign suitor must engage in the delicate, protracted process of wooing employees and shareholders.    Chiyoji Misawa, president of Misawa Homes Co. and one of Japan's most aggressive mergers-and-acquisitions practitioner, says he goes to great lengths to reassure people about his good intentions. He says he has never fired an employee of a company he has taken over.    &quot;Simply transferring the stock means nothing,&quot; Mr. Misawa says. &quot;The order is to talk {first} with the executives. If you go about it in reverse order, things get emotional and don't work out. There's nothing you can do about it -- it's tradition.&quot;    Practically speaking, there is rarely an alternative, says Daiwa's Mr. Yamamoto. Cross-holdings among institutional investors and companies loyal to management keep out of circulation the vast majority of shares outstanding. That is why tender offers aren't done in Japan, and why Minebea hasn't raised its stake in Sankyo Seiki in two years, he says.    &quot;After a certain point, Minebea just can't buy up any more Sankyo Seiki stock,&quot; Mr. Yamamoto says. &quot;It isn't for sale.&quot;    Minebea's gambit may yet pay off, though. Many takeovers in Japan start out unfriendly but turn sweet by the time the deed is accomplished.    &quot;It starts out with a vicious fight and in the end you see pictures of the two presidents shaking hands and smiling,&quot; says Kanji Ishizumi, a Tokyo attorney specializing in mergers and acquisitions. He estimates at least three out of every 10 takeovers have hostile origins.    Serving as catalysts in many of these deals are shadowy stock-market speculators called &quot;kaishime,&quot; or &quot;cornering&quot; groups. They discreetly buy up stock in a company, often fishing for bargains. The objective is to drive up the stock price and sell for capital gains. Often this takes the form of greenmail, when a company buys back stock from an unwanted suitor at a premium.    Because companies in Japan are forbidden by law from owning their own issues, managers must persuade friendly concerns such as financial institutions or other major investors to bail them out. That is how Fujiya Co., a big confectionary maker, resolved a three-year stalemate with a speculator group in December. Fujiya arranged to have Fuji Merchant, a related company, buy back the 47.6% of Fujiya shares outstanding from a kaishime group, for about 75 billion yen ($501.5 million).    Sometimes a speculator group will sell to an outsider, who emerges in the &quot;white knight&quot; role. Or, a publicity-shy conglomerate might recruit a kaishime group to quietly amass shares on its behalf.    Whether it is advisable for foreign concerns to play ball with the kaishime groups is a sensitive question. While the speculators have recently become openly identified with legitimate transactions, they retain the stigma of being associated with &quot;dirty money,&quot; an underground economy that evades taxes and launders the profits of loan sharks.    Even if the indigenous takeover game isn't fully accepted, there is increasing speculation that American-style takeovers will one day arrive in Japan.    &quot;The prevailing tides of internationalization can eventually be expected to bring hostile Mandamp;A to Japan's shores,&quot; says a report by Sanwa Bank. &quot;The relentless trend toward an international borderless economy will . . . require the reconciliation of American-style Mandamp;A activities with Japanese management practices.&quot;    With the expected boom comes a rush to provide consulting, banking and legal services. The field is already getting crowded.    &quot;The competition is booming, but the deals aren't. The whole pie isn't expanding,&quot; says Morgan Stanley's Mr. Imanishi. &quot;But then, you don't need many deals to be profitable. This is a very lucrative business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
