Although a rate increase had been widely anticipated as a result of recent snugging of short-term interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve, traders called the 1/2 point increase &quot;aggressive,&quot; saying the market had been preparing for a 1/4 point rise.    Immediately following the announcement by Chase Manhattan Bank that it was increasing its prime rate to 9% from 8 1/2%, the dollar spiked upward as market participants rushed to cover short positions taken earlier in the day. Prior to the announcement, the dollar had been drifting lower at midday as foreign exchange dealers watched the stock market decline.    In late trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 124.47 yen, up from 124.37 late Tuesday, and at 1.6827 marks, up from 1.6793. In trading Thursday in Tokyo, the U.S. currency opened at 124.35 yen, up from Wednesday's close of 124.24.    &quot;The market got caught short dollars just before the prime rate hike because people were watching the stock market and buying sterling,&quot; said Dave Purpora, a trader at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.    &quot;This was just mild a panic,&quot; said one corporate dealer at a major money-center bank, referring to the dollar buying after the prime rate increase announcements. He added that broad selling interest around 124.50 yen put an effective ceiling on the rally.    In terms of overall movement, however, the reaction to the prime rate hike was muted, with the dollar remaining riveted to the middle of its now familiar trading ranges, failing to test key resistance levels.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 40 cents an ounce to $449.70 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $448.90 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                  Late New York Trading                  Wednesday, May 11, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
