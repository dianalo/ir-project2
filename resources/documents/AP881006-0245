The 10-year-old is probably as good a shot as anyat a popular suburban shooting range.   But there's another side of the story about children andfirearms, especially in Florida, where the Legislature recentlymade it easier for residents to buy and carry sidearms.   In Dade County alone, 37 youths 18 years old and under have beenfatally shot this year, 13 more than in all of 1987, according tothe Medical Examiner's Office.   Just this summer, the body of a 14-year-old boy was hidden for10 days by three young brothers in St. Petersburg who panicked whena shotgun they were playing with accidentally discharged; a14-year-old boy was accidentally shot to death by his older brotherin the farming town of Pahokee; an 11-year-old boy shot in the headby a playmate remains hospitalized in Tampa.   And an 11-year-old Miami boy was shot and killed during aso-called game of ``courage.'' Three friends were charged withmanslaughter.   Police blame the tragedies on improperly stored weapons, peerpressure, television violence and irresponsible adults. They alsocite relaxed state gun laws that have increased the number offirearms in some communities.   ``We're too gun-happy,'' says veteran Metro-Dade homicide Lt.Mike Gonzalez. ``There are so many guns lying around in people'shomes and cars that naturally kids are going to get into them.''   Some children such as Aaron get gun safety instruction at home,but those killed and wounded often have little or no knowledge offirearms.   As part of a national effort, the National Rifle Association hasproposed a program in Florida elementary schools focusing on gunsafety.   Although state Education Commissioner Betty Castor has flatlyrejected the idea, some school districts, including Dade County,are looking at some form of gun education.   Schools could help counter the feeling among many youths thatguns are ``cool,'' said Steve Morris, an educator at a school wherea Miami youth was recently slain with a handgun.   ``We need to give more information on handguns _ not how to usethem but the dangers involved,'' said Morris, assistant principalof Glades Junior High School, where seventh grader Marcus Mayorgahad just started summer school when he was killed.   ``Maybe they need to see a picture of someone with their headblown up,'' he suggested, acknowledging that may be too graphic.``We need to show them the final outcome ... the anguish caused toparents and friends.''   Marcus and some friends got together July 12, unsupervised atthe home of a girl who had found the gun earlier under a dresser,and they devised a Russian Roulette-style game to test each other'scourage.   The game involved distracting the ``victim'' while one of themunloaded the gun, according to Metro-Dade Det. John Butchko.   Tragically, when Marcus was playing the victim the gun remainedloaded. He was killed instantly.   Three teens now face manslaughter charges and will be tried injuvenile court, Butchko said.   Deadly games of chance killed three other Miami youths _ ages14, 16 and 18 _ this year in separate incidents, according to theMedical Examiner's Office.   ``It's amazing there haven't been more cases like that,'' saiddetective Gonzalez.   The problem is not unique to Florida, of course. Nationwide, 328youths 19 years old and under were killed by firearms in 1985, thelatest year for which figures are available, according to theMaryland-based National Center for Health Statistics.   Gonzalez, Morris and Florida's NRA spokeswoman Marion Hammerbelieve that television violence may have a role in encouragingchildren to glamorize guns and not treat them seriously.   ``I think TV to a great extent is responsible because a lot ofchildren know absolutely nothing about guns other than what theysee on TV, and those are the wrong things,'' said Ms. Hammer.   The level of violence consumed by the average child appears tohave increased in recent years, with more movies available onvideocassette and cable television, said Dr. Thomas Redecki,research director for the private National Coalition on TelevisionViolence. He estimated that the average child in the United States,by age 18, will witness on TV 32,000 murders, 40,000 attemptedmurders and 225,000 acts of violence.   The NRA is pushing for an elementary-level gun safety programthat would focus on the concept of ``No. Go. Tell.'' That is, if ayoungster sees a gun, neither to pick it up nor to get near someonehandling it but to tell an adult about it.   ``Regardless of where you stand philosophically on the issue,the common ground upon which we must all stand is the safety andprotection of children,'' Ms. Hammer insists.   David Voss, spokesman for the state education commissioner, saidhis boss ``simply does not feel it is the school's responsibilityto teach about guns. She also is against any sort of state-mandatedprogram regardless of what you think about the issue; schools haveall they can handle now.''   Voss didn't know of any districts considering firearmseducation, and Ms. Hammer said she could not identify those whichshe said had expressed an interest in the NRA proposal or somethingsimilar.   Dade County, however, has a committee studying the issue.   ``I think we're treading on some dangerous ground ... We knowit's a critical issue but it's incumbent upon us to carefullyplan,'' said Gloria McPhee, executive director of general and basicskills education for the county. She said the likely target of gunsafety information would be parents, who could in turn discuss theissue with their children.   Ten-year-old Aaron, who goes to the shooting range every fewweeks, isn't so sure that talking to kids in school about guns willhelp stop them from getting hurt.   He said his father, who accompanies him on the outings, hastaught him well about firearm safety, but ``not all people have asgood a father.''   Reciting his No. 1 safety rule, he said, ``As far as I'mconcerned, every gun is loaded.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Oct. 10</NOTE></DOC>
