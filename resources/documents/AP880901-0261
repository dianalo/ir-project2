Plaintiff attorneys said the deal with the supply systemannounced Wednesday will gain the cooperation of WPPSS employees,who will be leading witnesses when the securities fraud trialstarts Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz.   WPPSS agreed this week to settle litigation against it over thesystem's $2.25 billion bond default in 1983. The bonds were sold tofinance construction of two nuclear power plants, which were nevercompleted.   The trial was moved to Tucson after judges in Seattle excusedthemselves because of possible perceived conflicts of interest andbecause some feared it would be impossible to get an impartial juryto hear the case.   Thousands of people in Washington lost money because of thedefault.   Bondholders agreed to drop claims against WPPSS in return foraccess to accounts for the terminated power plants, Nos. 4 and 5,containing millions of dollars.   Remaining defendants include 20 public utilities in Washingtonand one in Oregon that participated in building the plants, threeengineering firms and a firm that had provided WPPSS with financialadvice.   The abrupt pullout of WPPSS caught other defendants by surprise,and one acknowledged consideration was being given to requesting atrial delay.   ``We're surprised they (WPPSS) didn't stay and defend theiractions ...,'' said Chuck Shigley, administrator for the SnohomishCounty Public Utility District.   WPPSS paid no money in the tentative settlement, but agreed thatit has an obligation to pay the face value and interest on thebonds _ which total about $3 billion.   ``Since you can't get blood out of a turnip, why not get all theother benefits you can,'' said Mel Weiss, representing class actionplaintiffs in the giant lawsuit.   However, the agreement noted that because of limited assetspledged to secure the bonds, there was ``no expectation'' the moneywould ever be paid.   The WPPSS Executive Board was expected to approve the agreementwhen it meets Friday in Richland, Wash., in a special meeting, saidCarl Halvorson, board chairman.   ``It's a very favorable settlement for the supply system,'' hesaid.   The tentative settlement, which also requires the approval ofpresiding U.S. District Judge William D. Browning, protects WPPSS'other assets against any further judgments in the case.   In the legal action, bondholders sued the supply system, 88utilities, bond underwriters, various directors and managers,engineering firms and advisors after WPPSS defaulted on $2.25billion worth of bonds.   Many defendants have settled over the past year, including bondunderwriters and more than 60 utilities. They have agreed to pay atotal of $331 million and may face further liabilities.   The terminated plants are located at the Hanford nuclearreservation and Satsop, west of Olympia.   Meanwhile, Browning ruled Wednesday in Tucson that bondholdersare permitted to try to prove they should be fully refunded for thebonds they bought. Common law and state law permit rescission, orrefund, damages, Browning said in his nine-page order.   Claims under the federal Securities Act allow only forout-of-pocket losses, Browning said. That means the differencebetween what the bondholder paid and what the value of the bondswere.   In both instances, the bondholders will be allowed to try toprove that because of misrepresentations, they bought bonds thatotherwise would not have been put on the market and thereforeshould get full refunds plus interest.</TEXT></DOC>
