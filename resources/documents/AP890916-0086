Police said at least 12 people were wounded in sporadic clashesthat continued hours after an Arab League mediation committee issuedits latest call for a truce and said it is sending an envoy Sundayto implement a peace plan.   A police spokesman, who by custom is not named, said he doubtsthe fighting will abate before the arrival of the delegate, Algeriandiplomat Lakhdar Ibrahimi.   A source at Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's army command accused theSyrians of ``maintaining the provocative firing against ourpositions.''   ``Our officers have strict orders to practice maximumself-restraint. But they can't sit and watch others attacking themwithout defending themselves,'' the source said on condition ofanonymity.   Aoun did not immediately comment on the truce call, which waswelcomed by his chief rival, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.   ``This is a chance to end the crisis that might not berepeated,'' the Sunni Moslem leader said in a statement.   Syria also welcomed the truce call and urged ``all Lebaneseparties'' to cooperate with the Arab League envoy, according to theofficial Syrian Arab News Agency.   ``The Syrian government is convinced that the implementation ofthese security measures will lead to preventing bloodshed and willpave the way to solving the Lebanese crisis,'' it quoted anunidentified official as saying.   In the United States, the call was praised by the Bushadministration and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   The White House welcomed the declaration as ``a constructivebasis upon which all parties to the conflict in Lebanon can engagein a political process devoid of violence and coercion.''   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said theadministration plans to restaff its embassy in Beirut as soon as itsdiplomats ``can be reasonably safe and effective.''   Washington evacuated its 30 diplomats in Beirut on Sept. 5 afterAoun reportedly threatened to take Americans hostage. The MaroniteCatholic general denied making such a threat.   He has accused Washington of favoring Syria, saying any actionagainst that nation could harm eight Americans held byIranian-backed Shiite Moslem groups in Lebanon. Syria is Iran's mainally and has pledged to help free the Americans, among 16 Westernersmissing in Lebanon.   Aoun, who is armed by Iraq, has vowed to drive Syria's 40,000troops from Lebanon, charging they have betrayed an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems. Syria wants to linkany pullout to a withdrawal of Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.   In Beirut, Moslem and Christian radio stations interruptedregular programming with reports of the cease-fire call, whichfollowed a night of ferocious shelling duels in Beirut and thesurrounding mountains that killed 12 people and wounded 72.   At least 914 people have been killed and 2,697 have been woundedin the 6-month-old artillery war between Aoun's forces and Syriansoldiers.   ``There can be no solution to the Lebanese crisis by militarymeans,'' said a communique issued in Algeria, Morocco and SaudiArabia, whose leaders make up the mediation committee.   The statement said the cease-fire call is meant to ``stop thebloodshed and establish an atmosphere conducive to assuring thereturn of security, stability and national reconciliation.''   It called on all parties to stop supplying weapons to thecombatants in Lebanon and said it already has received ``positiveresponses in this regard.''   It said a Lebanese security committee would be set up underIbrahimi to supervise implementation of the cease-fire and monitorships reported to be carrying weapons, or ammunition.   Blockades, imposed by the Syrians on the 310-square-mileChristian enclave and by Aoun on illegal ports run by Syria'smilitia allies south of Beirut, would be lifted as soon as thesecurity committee began its work, the statement said.   The Arab League committee called for a meeting of Lebanon'sparliament on Sept. 30 at a location to be decided later to``discuss and prepare'' political reforms. The committee comprisesKing Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and AlgerianPresident Chadli Bendjedid.   Saturday's call for a halt to the fighting is the latest of manythat have gone unanswered. The new initiative follows a Julydeadlock, when the committee blamed Syria for blocking its missionby refusing to withdraw its troops.   Prince Saud al-Faisal, foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, toldreporters in Jiddah that Syria supports the new peace plan. But headmitted the committee has no power to enforce its call.   ``The committee possesses no weapons with which it would imposeits will in Lebanon,'' Saud responded to a question.   The current round of violence broke out March 8 over Aoun'sblockade of ports run by Moslem militias _ a vain attempt toreassert government control in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
