A bilateral agreement, to be signed today, commits Chinato adhere to two international copyright conventions, to takeother steps to curb piracy in computer software and soundrecordings, and to extend stronger protection to U.S.producers of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.</LP><TEXT>   Devised after six days of hard negotiating, the accordeffectively ends the threat of punitive U.S. tariffs onhundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese imports. Thosesanctions would have been imposed if these negotiations hadfailed.   The resolution comes as a great relief to U.S. exporters.China had vowed to retaliate for any U.S. sanctions byimposing its own high tariffs against U.S. imports.   The International Intellectual Property Alliance, whichrepresents U.S. computer, software, motion-picture and othercopyright-sensitive industries, hailed the agreement as amajor breakthrough. As a reward for China's &quot;statesmanship,&quot;the alliance is prepared to endorse continuing that country'smost-favored-nation trade benefits, according to the group'sgeneral counsel, Eric Smith.   U.S. trade officials agreed that the Chinese concessionscould help win over members of Congress who still questionChina's right to the preferential trade status because of itspoor record on human rights. Most-favored-nation statusassures the best treatment available to U.S. tradingpartners.   Although China took a tough, nationalistic line at variousstages of the negotiations with the U.S., it finally gave into most American demands. Specifically, the Chinese agreed toprotect U.S. patents for 20 years after they are filed. Thatis a major improvement on an earlier Chinese offer to providesuch protection for only 15 years.   China also offered to provide similar protection to U.S.chemicals and pharmaceuticals that are still unpatentedbecause of protracted Food and Drug Administration tests.That part of the agreement covers products caught in the&quot;pipeline&quot; from June 1, 1986, to June 2001.   As a further concession to the U.S. pharmaceutical andchemical industries, China agreed that except in very limitedcircumstances it won't require foreign patent holders togrant Chinese manufacturers licenses to produce the patentedgoods in China. Compulsory licensing frequently deprivespatent owners of much potential income once their productscatch on in the marketplace.   &quot;We've gotten {most of} what we've been seeking all theseyears,&quot; a senior U.S. trade official asserted.   China agreed to seal its commitments to protect U.S.copyrighted works by joining the Berne convention, whichrequires its signatories to respect copyrights for the lifeof the author plus 50 years, by Oct. 15. China also promisedto treat copyrighted computer software as &quot;literary works&quot;and give it 50-year protection. Previously, China protectedonly the works of Chinese nationals or those first publishedin China, and it refused to recognize software as &quot;literarywork,&quot; according to the intellectual property alliance.   China's commitments cover existing copyrighted works aswell as those yet to be copyrighted. Moreover, China pledgedto give the holders of software and recording copyrightscontrol over the rental of their products.   The Chinese also agreed to join a Geneva convention thatprovides copyright protection for sound recordings, by June1993.   In addition, the Chinese said they will enact legislationto protect trade secrets -- confidential information used bymanufacturers -- by June 1994. In the U.S. and many othercountries, trade secrets are treated as commercial property,but that isn't the case in China and other developingcountries. Trade secrets aren't normally covered by patent orcopyright laws because they don't involve physical inventionsor unique production processes, although they are importantassets.   The agreement provides for &quot;consultations&quot; between Chinaand the U.S. on prospective Chinese measures to enforce Berneconvention rules and other promised protections. Theagreement also requires China to enter into a separatebilateral copyright accord with the U.S. within 60 days.   Although yesterday's agreement removes one major irritantin U.S.-Chinese relations, other bilateral trade issuesremain unresolved. The U.S. is still pressing China todismantle various barriers to U.S. goods and services,including high tariffs, import quotas on a variety of goodsand regulations that U.S. exporters contend are unnecessary.Moreover, despite Chinese disavowals, some members ofCongress continue to contend that Chinese goods made byprison labor are landing in the U.S. in violation of U.S.law.</TEXT></DOC>
