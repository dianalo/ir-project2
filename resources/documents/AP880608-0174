North, John M. Poindexter and two other defendantseach be tried separately so they can defend themselves using eachother's congressional testimony given under a grant of limitedimmunity.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked independent counselLawrence E. Walsh to decide whether he wants to try North orPoindexter in the first of four trials.   The other two defendants, Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim,would be tried later.   Gesell also said the trials should be held in Washington,rejecting a defense argument that the pretrial publicity hasdamaged the defendants' right to a fair trial.   The defendants had urged a separate trial on grounds that theimmunized testimony included information that would prove theirinnocence. For instance, Secord has said that testimony by Northwould show that money from U.S. arms sales to Iran belonged toSecord's business enterprise rather than the U.S. government as theindictment charged.   While North's testimony could not be used in his own trial, itcould be used in Secord's, and vice-versa.   Gesell said that ``any defendant should have considerable leewayto use indirectly...and possibly directly immunized testimony whiledefending the charges against him.''   He said the right to a fair trial ``cannot be preserved if anytwo defendants are tried together.''   Walsh is barred from using the defendants' immunizedcongressional testimony as evidence against them even though thedefendants can use it themselves.   Outside the courthouse, Walsh declined to comment on the judge'sdecision except to say that ``everyone realizes that four trialsare more burdensome than one but the judge feels that that's anecessary requirement to protect the constitutional rights of allfour defendants.''   Walsh declined to say whether North of Poindexter would be triedfirst. Gesell gave the prosecutor until Friday to make his decision.   Gesell said defendants at criminal trials are ``afforded thepowerful weapon of cross-examination, an essential part of ouradversarial system.''   ``Cross-examination is an effective means of ensuring the truthwill prevail before a jury. It's a precious constitutional right,''the judge said.   ``Each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimonyrevealed information which one or more of the defendants considershelpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect'' of thecase, Gesell said.   ``Each defendant has contemplated using immunized testimony ofother witnesses,'' Gesell said.   The judge said Congress had a legitimate interest in conductingthe hearings but he noted that questioning of North, Poindexter andHakim was ``in a highly accusatory context spiked with accusationof criminal impropriety.''   In arguments before the decision, Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyerfor Walsh, said that publicity, while extensive, has often favoredthe defendants.   He said ``Colonel North is on the lecture circuit and receives$20,000 a lecture. He certainly doesn't carry a stigma that wouldbe prejudicial in this case.''   Any evidence of pre-trial prejudice, he said, should be tested``against real people who step into the jury box.''   And he added, ``We don't think any political considerationsought to enter into fixing a trial date.''   Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's attorney, argued that theIran-Contra affair will play a major role in the presidentialcampaign, especially as questions are raised about Vice PresidentGeorge Bush's role.   ``It would be a travesty to have this case proceed under thatglare and spotlight,'' he said.   North, Poindexter, Secord and Hakim are charged in a 23-countindictment with conspiring to illegally divert profits from sale ofarms to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Other counts involveobstruction of presidential and congressional investigations of theIran-Contra affair, and theft of U.S. government property.   Beckler said the Iran-Contra case, unlike the Watergate scandal,saw the public exposed to massive amounts of information fromCongress and the Reagan administration that would not be admissibleat trial.   And he said the congressional hearings on Watgergate were heldwhen it was not certain there would be criminal prosecutions.   In the Iran-Contra case, Beckler said, the independent counselalready was preparing his case as Congress was receiving testimonyunder grants of limited immunity against prosecution _ informationthat will not be used at trial.   Gesell assured Beckler, ``If these men are convicted, they'renot going to be convicted by pre-trial publicity. That can beassured.</TEXT></DOC>
