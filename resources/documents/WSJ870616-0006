LevinSpecial to The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN><TEXT>   Fred Lee discovered ultrasound's potential for detecting prostate cancer in the most frightening way imaginable.    Three years ago, Dr. Lee volunteered to let technicians at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., demonstrate on him how ultrasound could be used to examine the prostate. While Dr. Lee lay on his side, a technician guided the ultrasound probe, adjusting the high-frequency sound waves until a picture of the walnut-sized gland, located at the neck of the urinary bladder, appeared on the screen.    When the demonstration revealed a lesion in his prostate, Dr. Lee -- a fitness buff as well as a radiologist familiar with many of ultrasound's medical uses -- was shocked. A biopsy confirmed that the tumor was malignant.    &quot;I was running marathons and was all muscle and bone. I never felt healthier,&quot; recalls Dr. Lee, 56 years old. &quot;I said to myself, 'There can't be anything wrong with me.'&quot;    After starting treatment for cancer, Dr. Lee put aside his other projects to begin researching the use of ultrasound in detecting -- and as an aid in treating -- prostate cancer. So far, he has performed or supervised more than 5,000 ultrasound prostate examinations and has become one of the most enthusiastic advocates of the technology. He predicts that the procedure will become a routine tool in detecting prostate cancer -- the second leading fatal malignancy, after lung cancer, among men in the U.S.    Many medical practitioners, however, say the benefits of using ultrasound to detect prostate cancer have been exaggerated. &quot;People have jumped on ultrasound with a lot of emotion, but to me the bottom line is, we still need more hard data,&quot; says Thomas Stamey, professor of urology at Stanford University.    Doctors for years have urged annual prostate examinations for men 40 years of age or older. The typical procedure takes a few moments in a doctor's office and consists of a manual rectal exam to determine whether a tumor has begun growing in the gland.    The manual exam, however, sometimes fails to detect tumors, especially small ones. Early detection is important because, by the time a tumor grows large, the cancer often has spread to the bones and become terminal. Dr. Lee says the rectal ultrasound probe often detects small tumors that a manual exam has missed.    Not all doctors are convinced that ultrasound is any better at detecting prostate tumors than the manual rectal exam. Martin Resnick, a professor of urology at University Hospitals in Cleveland, says ultrasound machines may help determine the size of a tumor and may aid in guiding a biopsy needle, &quot;but for diagnosis, ultrasound doesn't present any major advance over a rectal exam.&quot;    Moreover, the procedure is often done by radiologists rather than urologists, who are experienced in treating the prostate. &quot;From the beginning of time, the urologists have taken care of the prostate,&quot; says Phillip Mosbaugh, a urologist who practices at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, &quot;and there are some concerns that the urologists are being bypassed&quot; by radiologists using ultrasound. &quot;The ideal situation is for the radiologists and urologists to work together,&quot; he adds.    Critics of the ultrasound exams say the procedure results in too many false readings, and that it is difficult to produce a clear ultrasound image of certain parts of the prostate. &quot;Half of all cancers are in the anterior zone of the prostate (away from the rectum), and we are skeptical ultrasound can detect cancers there,&quot; Dr. Stamey says.    Costs are another problem. Dr. Resnick says ultrasound screenings for prostate cancer can cost up to $300, compared with $25 for a traditional prostate exam. Also, he says the ultrasound procedure takes 15 to 30 minutes, compared with five minutes for the traditional method.    The criticism has hurt some ultrasound screening programs. In November, the radiology department at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis started publicizing its new $80,000 ultrasound machine to attract patients for prostate exams. Ten to 12 men each day began showing up for the $50 test, says Gonzalo Chua, director of radiology education at the hospital.    Two months after the service began, Indiana University medical school held a seminar on prostate cancer at which two urologists denounced ultrasound as a screening method. Their main criticisms were that the ultrasound examinations didn't involve urologists, that manual rectal exams were still necessary and that ultrasound screenings had a high incidence of false readings. After the criticism was reported locally, patient walk-in traffic for the ultrasound prostate screening dropped to about one a day. Dr. Chua blames the decrease largely on the negative publicity.    Despite the skepticism, even some urologists are beginning to use ultrasound. Dr. Mosbaugh and other urologists at a clinic separate from Methodist Hospital recently bought their own ultrasound machine. Unlike the hospital's radiologists, Dr. Mosbaugh and his partners don't use the machine to detect prostate cancer -- that's still done in a manual rectal exam. Instead, they use it to evaluate the size and precise location of the tumor after it is detected.    As the ultrasound screenings are used more widely, doctors are learning more about the procedure's effectiveness and how to interpret the findings. Dr. Lee, for one, remains positive about ultrasound's increasing role in prostate screening. And he credits the procedure with saving his life: His condition now is stable after having undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy.    Urologists &quot;are good with their hands, but terrible with their eyes,&quot; Dr. Lee says. &quot;Anyone who doesn't think ultrasound is going to change this field will have mud on his face.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
