The Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC), a powerfullobbying organization, undertook this summer to delay a studyon the economics of pesticide regulation by two agriculturaleconomists at the University of California, Berkeley. TheNRDC feared that the study would provide California voters inthe November election with information adverse to Proposition128, &quot;Big Green,&quot; which NRDC had helped to draft.</LP><TEXT>   While the report was eventually published, and Proposition128 was defeated, this story still remains important -- asfurther evidence that environmental regulation is ascientific and economic issue that is being guided not byscience and economics but by the skills of street fighters inthe back alleys of politics, the courts and the media.   The San Francisco Chronicle broke the story on Oct. 31,but without mentioning the NRDC by name. The Chroniclerevealed that the two state legislators who chair thesubcommittees that control University of California budgetrequests, Sen. Nicholas Petris and Assemblyman RobertCampbell had written to Berkeley President David Gardner onAug. 9 warning that the research project might jeopardize theuniversity's funding:   &quot;We strongly urge to you to reconsider the researchproject that is now planned for publication this fall. . . .It is evident that we are entering a period of austerity inwhich various institutions will be asked to eliminateprograms. . . . We urge you not to risk the university'sstanding by publishing research involving such highly chargedpolitical issues.&quot;   Behind the legislators' implicit threat lay a letter fromthe NRDC's Albert Meyerhoff to President Gardner dated June25 with copies to Vice President Kenneth Farrell, the 31members of the Board of Regents, U.S. Sens. Pat Leahy andRichard Lugar and State Assemblyman Campbell. The NRDCobjected to the study and its publication &quot;on an expeditedbasis . . . prior to the election&quot; as a misuse of publicfunds.   Mr. Meyerhoff then met with Mr. Farrell, head of thedivision of agriculture and natural resources. Mr. Meyerhofffollowed up with an Aug. 6 letter to Mr. Farrell summarizingtheir meeting. In that letter, Mr. Meyerhoff said that theNRDC still believed &quot;it entirely inappropriate for theUniversity to utilize public resources, on an unprecedentedand expedited schedule, in order to generate this reportprior to the election date.&quot; But he added that &quot;should youdecide to the contrary and go forward with this effort, wewish to confirm our understanding of the `ground rules' youproposed.&quot; These, according to Mr. Mayerhoff, includedenlarging the study to &quot;include representatives ofdisciplines beyond economics who are expert in pest controlissues&quot; and their &quot;health or environmental effects.&quot;   Mr. Farrell's interpretation was different. In a letter toMr. Meyerhoff dated Aug. 27, he wrote:   &quot;To characterize our research as being conducted on an`unprecedented and expedited schedule in order to generatethis report prior to the election date' is incorrect . . .The research we have undertaken with reference to pesticideregulation is not being timed to influence votes with respectto Proposition 128 but has been undertaken as a legitimateUniversity function intended to be useful to all partiesinterested in and concerned with long-term alternatives topesticides.&quot;   He added: &quot;University research is conducted by its facultyand other highly trained professionals. We do not instructthese individuals on matters bearing upon their professionalcompetency or on research methodology to be employed. Nor dowe direct them to time the publication of their research inconsideration of anyone's political interests or objectives.&quot;   Yet on that very same day, Mr. Farrell wrote a letter tothe chairman of the department of agriculture and researcheconomics warning that &quot;it is imperative that you comply withuniversity policy&quot; to remain neutral on political issues.Prof. David Zilberman, who headed the study, called it aviolation of academic freedom, according to a Nov. 7 articlein the student newspaper, the Daily Californian. &quot;If you dosomething that has anything to do with public policy, it isyour duty to publish it before election time,&quot; he said.Colleague Jerome Siebert, in the Oct. 31 San FranciscoChronicle article, called the warning a &quot;gag order.&quot; In theend, the authors published their study as a &quot;working paper&quot;and distributed 300 copies before the election, Mr. Siebertstated in a telephone interview.   The impropriety of university research that might have abearing on voting is a principle newly discovered by theNRDC. It has not objected to university activities promotingenvironmental regulation, nor did it object when Berkeleyofficials campaigned for Proposition 111 to increase thegasoline tax and bring more state funds to the university.   When the Chronicle exposed the legislators' tactics,Berkeley biochemist Thomas Jukes, armed with the additionalinformation that the NRDC was the initiator, wrote toPresident Gardner that Proposition 128's attack on pesticides&quot;was triggered&quot; by the NRDC's campaign against Alar, which hecharacterized as a case of &quot;irresponsible scare-mongering byNRDC.&quot;   The NRDC's &quot;scare-mongering&quot; is about to be examined inthe courts, an interesting reversal of the NRDC's usualposition in the legal system.   For years, the NRDC has been engaged in legal assaultsunder the Clean Water Act. It goes through business's recordsof their violations of the act, which they are required toreport, and threatens them with &quot;citizen damage&quot; suits.Companies settle rather than go through expensive courtbattles. (While the NRDC ordinarily designates third-partyrecipients for the settlements, the procedure adds to theorganization's clout in the environmental movement.) ThoughCongress in permitting such suits intended to enhanceenforcement, NRDC sues on violations sometimes long past thathave frequently been corrected.   Now, however, the suer is being sued. On Nov. 28, theapple industry filed a multimillion-dollar class-action suitagainst NRDC; CBS and two CBS affiliates in Washington thatbroadcast the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Alar program; and FentonCommunications, NRDC's public relations firm thatorchestrated the apple scare. Exposure of NRDC through thissuit could do wonders for cleansing the environment.   ---   Mr. Sirkin is a retired professor of economics at the CityCollege of the City University of New York.
