Both superpowers would move against Iraq under U.N. auspices,but the Soviets prefer to work under a joint military command whilethe United States prefers more ``logistical'' leeway, the officialstold The Associated Press.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has repeatedlycautioned Iraq that the military option might be taken, consultedlast week with more than a dozen foreign ministers attending theU.N. General Assembly session.   They included the British, French, West German, Japanese,Canadian and Italian ministers, who met with Baker over dinnerWednesday night. Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, which is resisting afreeze on trade ordered Aug. 6 by the U.N. Security Council, wasthe main topic.   ``A lot of ideas are kicking around,'' a U.S. official said.``Everybody is asking what we will do next.''   The official said the drafting at this point was tentative -``back of the envelope stuff,'' is the way he described it.``Everybody is looking at options,'' he said.   The officials said other delegations also have begun draftingproposed resolutions, all with the view of being ready to actagainst Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to restore Kuwait's nationallegitimacy.   There was no indication when the Council would be asked to takeup a call for action.   Besides the economic boycott, the Council has approved amilitary blockade and, last Tuesday, an embargo on air traffic.   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theBush administration was inclined to act under Article 42 of theU.N. Charter instead of Article 51, which affirms the right ofself-defense.   Article 42 authorizes ``action by air, sea or land forces as ...necessary to retain or restore international peace or security.''   The Soviet Union, which is cooperating with the Bushadministration against Iraq, is taking a harder line toward Saddamin plotting military action, the officials said.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze signaled a tough stanceSunday saying ``we are a permanent member of the security Counciland we will comply with any decision, with any resolution of thesecurity council.''   Shevardnadze, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' added:``That would include anything regarding the involvement of theSoviet troops under the flag, under the auspices, of the UnitedNations.''   In principle, Shevardnadze said, he would like to see the use offorce ruled out. But, he said, ``If extreme conditions develop,then any decision must be taken within the framework of thesecurity council.''   Shevardnadze stressed that the U.N. military staff committeemust be involved if force is used against Iraq.   Within the Bush administration, meanwhile, senior officials areintensifying the threat of force if economic sanctions do notcompel Iraq to withdraw from the oil-rich emirate.   On Friday, Brent Scowcroft, the president's assistant fornational security, said the ``systematic destruction'' of Kuwaitunder Iraqi occupation is shortening the time that the UnitedStates can wait for sanctions to drive out the Iraqi army.   President Bush will have a chance on Monday to coordinatestrategy with Moscow during an afternoon meeting with Shevardnadze.Baker will then see the Soviet foreign minister on Wednesday, theirthird meeting in less than a week.</TEXT></DOC>
