In addition, major newspapers urged state employees who engaged in embezzling, bribery and speculation to turn themselves in. Those who surrender before Oct. 31 will receive lighter sentences, according to an anti-corruption plan adopted by the Chinese Communist Party Politburo.    The moves are the latest in a government anti-corruption campaign launched to counter charges of official corruption. An end to such corruption was a main demand of the pro-democracy movement that was crushed June 3-4.    The state Auditing Administration, after a 10-month audit, ordered five companies to pay a total of $13.8 million in back taxes, penalties and restitution of illegally earned profits, Auditor-General Lu Peijian said in a report to the State Council, China's cabinet.    The official Xinhua news agency said the companies include two closed last month as part of the anti-corruption drive -- Kanghua Development Corp., linked to Mr. Deng's son, and China Incomic Development Corp.    The other audited companies were China International Trust andamp; Investment Corp., the nation's leading company for attracting foreign investment; Everbright Industrial Co., which has subsidiaries in Hong Kong, and China Rural Trust andamp; Investment Corp. i3 </TEXT></DOC>
