The gamme quantum absorbedin the detector generate a signal that is enhanced proportional to energy,and is stored after conversion in an analog-to-digital converter (pulseheight analysis). The various radionuclides are identified and theirradioactivity concentrations are determined by means of computerizedanalysing systems. There are various sample preparation methods to beapplied, depending on the analytic goals and the required detection limits.In order to achieve detection limits down to very low activity levels,pin-pointed enrichment methods are available, which require the determinationof chemical yields. The radionuclide analysis by means of gamma spectrometryis applied to immission and emission monitoring. The resulting data onactivity concentrations of given radionuclides serve as a basis for computingthe radiation dose to the population, and for checking compliance withthe dose limits defined by the Radiation Protection Ordinance.</TEXT></DOC>
