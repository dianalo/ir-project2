This program has been in existencefor several years at approximately the same funding level. No increasein funds has taken place. The Fire Research Grants Program is limited toinnovative ideas which are generated by the proposal writer on what researchto carry out and how to carry it out. Proposals will be considered forresearch projects from one to three years. When a proposal for a multi-yeargrant is approved, funding will be provided for only the first year ofthe program. Funding for the remaining years of the program is contingenton satisfactory performance and subject to the availability of funds, butno liability shall be assumed by the government because of non-renewalor non-extension of a grant. All grant proposals submitted must be in accordancewith the programs and objectives listed below. For clarity of the programobjectives, you may contact Dr. Andrew J. Fowell (301) 975-6850. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Objectives</ITAG>(a) Polymer Combustion Research_Chemical and physical processes associatedwith ignition, flame spread and smoldering of polymeric materials.(b) Smoke Dynamics Research_Develop scientifically sound principles, metrology,data, and predictive methods for the formation/evolution of smoke componentsin flames for use in understanding and modeling general fire phenomena.(c) Flammability and Toxicity Measurement_Measurement of the acute toxicityof fire gases, development of test methods and safety criteria, researchinto additive or synergistic acute effects of multiple gaseous toxicants,and development of behavior models for incapacitation. Development of laboratorysize tests and measurements that are of use in predicting the performanceof combustible items (including heat release rate, toxic gas production,and smoke production in full scale fire).(d) Fire Performance and Validation_Obtaining and analyzing experimentaldata from full scale tests for input to model development. Evaluation ofmathematical models and methodology for quantitatively assessing the correlationbetween the models and full-scale test data.(e) Hazard Analysis_Development and evaluation of mathematical smoke andtoxic species transport models for large, complex structures. Methods tocalculate hazard development vs. time. Methods to simulate the operationand impact of ventilation systems and components under conditions createdby unwanted fires. Some research is carried out into the behavior of personsat risk in fire to calculate how rapidly persons can evacuate the structureor otherwise find refuge.(f) Fire Growth and Extinction_Research into the physics and chemistryof fire processes such as burning rate, flame spread, fire gas flows, firesuppression, and the development of an understanding of the relationshipbetween these processes as they contribute to compartment fire growth andspread, fire suppression system performance and smoke transport in buildings.(g) Compartment Fire Modeling Research_The development, improvement andvalidation of: (1) ``benchmark'' compartment fire model computer codes,and (2) their submodel algorithm components which describe individual firecompartment processes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposal Review Process</ITAG>All proposals are assigned to the appropriate group leader of the sevenprograms listed above for review, including external peer review, and recommendationson funding. Both technical value of the proposal and the relationship ofthe work proposed to the needs of the specific program are taken into considerationin the group leader's recommendation to the center Director. Applicantsshould allow up to 60 days processing time. Proposals are evaluated fortechnical merit by at least three professionals from NBS, the Center forFire Research, or technical experts from other interested government agenciesand in the case of new proposals, experts from the fire research communityat large.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation Criteria</ITAG>Rationality_0-20 points.Qualification of Technical Personnel_0-20 points.Resources Availability_0-20 points.Technical Merit of Contribution_0-40 points.The results of these evaluations are transmitted to the head of the appropriateresearch unit in the Center for Fire Research who prepares an analysisof comments and makes a recommendation. The Center for Fire Research unithead will also consider compatibility with programmatic goals and financialfeasibility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The SF-424 mentioned in this notice is subject to the requirements of thePaperwork Reduction Act and it has been approved by OMB under Control No.0348-0006.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Requirements</ITAG>Applicants are reminded that a false statement may be grounds for denialor termination of funds and grounds for possible punishment by fine orimprisonment. Any recipients/applicants who have an outstanding indebtednessto the Department of Commerce will not receive a new award until the debtis paid or arrangements satisfactory to the Department are made to paythe debt.Administrative questions pertaining to the grant process may be directedto the Grants Specialist, Sharon Green, National Bureau of Standards, Bldg.301, Room B-158, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, telephone number (301) 975-6328.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 31, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ernest Ambler,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-12614 Filed 6-3-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-13-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
