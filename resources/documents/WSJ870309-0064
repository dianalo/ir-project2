A new study prepared by the Office of Management and Budget concludes that letting foreign countries share in producing the U.S. weapons they purchase, or barter for them, doesn't seriously hurt the U.S. economy. But the Commerce and Treasury Departments filed sharp dissenting views.    The split within the administration is likely to revive criticism of offset arrangements, which House leaders have suggested may hurt the U.S. trade balance and add to unemployment in this country.    The Carter administration tried to influence some offset deals, but the Reagan administration has taken a hands-off policy toward the practice. Congress ordered the administration to conduct the latest study, which President Reagan assigned to the budget office.    According to the study, offset arrangements accounted for 26% of the $11.2 billion in U.S. arms exports in 1984.    In a typical offset arrangement, a foreign country insists, as a condition to buying U.S.-made weapons, on building parts of the weapons itself. The purpose is to save foreign exchange and improve the country's own technological capacity.    In some instances, U.S. manufacturers even are required to help foreign countries construct factories to build the American weapons. General Dynamics Corp., for instance, has agreed to help pay for a plant in Turkey to assemble and produce portions of F-16 jet fighters the company is selling to that country.    In some other cases, countries have paid partially for U.S. weapons with local products, such as sugar or minerals, rather than in cash.    The government study said that while such arrangements result in less domestic output and poorer cash flow than would occur if the sales were made for hard currency, the U.S. on balance still benefits from them. The study said offset arrangements each year generate billions of dollars in additional trade that otherwise would be lost to other arms-exporting countries, many of which use offset arrangements more extensively than the U.S. And it said the effect of offset sales on U.S. employment is &quot;negligible.&quot;    The Commerce Department argued, in a letter to the budget office, that the study failed to reflect &quot;potential negative effects including increasing the number of foreign competitors through technology transfer, diverting work from U.S. subcontractors, and increasing employment in competing foreign industries.&quot; The letter was signed by Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration.    The Treasury, in its own letter to the OMB, complained that the budget office's editing of material submitted by other agencies &quot;fundamentally changed&quot; the study's tone from being &quot;essentially negative&quot; to being &quot;on the whole positive.&quot;    The study did reflect some of the Commerce Department's concerns in its analysis of Raytheon Co.'s sales of medium-range Patriot air-defense missiles to West Germany, the Netherlands and Japan. Although no other country produces a comparable missile, Raytheon agreed in 1984 to farm out to West German suppliers more than half the value of an $872 million sale to the Bonn government.    Moreover, the study said an offset arrangement worked out with Japan in 1985 effectively reduced Raytheon, Martin Marietta Corp. and other original Patriot builders to the status of &quot;subcontractors&quot; of a Japanese group headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. Under the agreement, Japanese companies will provide 57% of a $2.6 billion Patriot missile sale to Japan.    &quot;In the future,&quot; the study warned, &quot;we can expect increased numbers of foreign competitors for both complete and partial weapons systems as well as commercial products because of arrangements such as the Patriot deals.&quot;    Raytheon denied that it's freely giving away jobs. &quot;We aren't crazy about offsets, but we'd enter into them as a compromise business arrangement if it's the best that's available,&quot; said Raytheon spokesman Lawrence McCracken. He added that there were also some &quot;political and national security&quot; considerations behind the decision to share the Patriot business with the three U.S. allies.    Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Small Business Committee, criticized the administration's hands-off policy concerning offset arrangements. He didn't specify what action he believes should be taken, though.    &quot;While the agencies quibble our industrial base may be eroding,&quot; he said. &quot;It's clear that we need a new data-collection effort and a more effective policy process.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
