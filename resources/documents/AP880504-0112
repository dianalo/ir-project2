Through April 29, the latest figures available, the IRS hadcertified 55.5 million refunds, compared with 55.4 million at thesame time last year. Refunds were claimed on 79.5 percent of thereturns that had been processed, up from 79.1 percent a year ago.   ``Apparently withholding was more in line with tax liabilitythan we had been expecting,'' said IRS spokesman Johnell Hunter.   Tax experts had anticipated that fewer people might qualify forrefunds this year because the new tax law required all employees tofile new W-4 withholding forms with their employers in 1987.   The first version of the new form was designed to match taxliability with withholding. But it was so confusing that the IRSeventually developed an alternative, W-4A, that was simpler butless accurate.   Another forecast _ that fewer people would itemize deductionsunder the new law _ was closer to target. Through April 15,slightly fewer than half the 49 million couples and individuals whofiled the long form, 1040, itemized deductions, compared with 60percent last year.   Through Friday, the IRS had received 98.6 million returns, a 2percent increase over 96.7 million in the same period in 1987.Before the year is out, the agency anticipates 107.6 million totalfilings, compared with 104 million last year.   Some other statistics from this year's filing season:   _Almost 4.8 million people have asked so far for automaticfour-month extensions beyond the April 15 filing deadline. At thistime last year, the IRS had counted about 4.4 million. For reasonsthe IRS cannot explain, the number of extensions fluctuatedsignificantly among the 10 regional centers. At Philadelphia,extensions were 28 percent below last year's mark while atCincinnati they were up 47 percent.   _The average refund this year has been $850, compared with justunder $849 last year.   _The IRS has processed 69.9 million returns so far this year,down 0.2 percent from 70 million in 1987.   _Only slightly more couples and individuals hired professionalsto fill out their returns this year, despite confusion about thenew law. Through April 15, 45.6 percent of the returns wereprofessionally prepared, compared with 44.9 percent at the sametime last year.</TEXT></DOC>
