His comments were reported byHungary's official MTI news agency.   ``If his proposals come up for discussion at the conferencehere, these will be, in our opinion, the most important Westerninitiatives on arms reduction since the signing of the INFagreement,'' Meiszter told delegates Tuesday, likening theinitiative to the 1987 treaty eliminating medium-range nuclearmissiles.   The talks on Conventional Forces in Europe, which started herein March, aim to reduce the element of a surprise attack byestablishing a secure and stable balance of conventional forcesfrom the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains.   ``In compliance with President Bush's proposals, the way is openfor a comprehensive agreement on the reduction of the mostdestabilizing military units,'' MTI quoted Meiszter as saying.   Bush seized the initiative in East-West relations Monday byproposing a 20 percent cut in U.S. combat troops in Europe and aceiling of 275,000 soldiers on each side, requiring the Soviets todemobilize 325,000 troops on the continent.   The Warsaw Pact on Tuesday proposed limits for conventionalarmaments in the Central European zone where most deadly weaponryis massed on the continent.   East German Ambassador Klaus-Dieter Ernst presented reporterswith proposals to cut back on six types of weapons by 1996-97 andlimit each side to: 570,000 troops, 420 tactical aircraft, 800combat helicopters, 8,700 tanks, 7,600 artillery pieces and 14,500armored troop carriers.   Countries included in the proposal are Czechoslovakia, EastGermany, Hungary and Poland from the East and, from the WesternNATO alliance, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands andWest Germany.   Speaking for the Warsaw Pact, Ernst chided the West for refusingto include strike aircraft, combat helicopters and manpower in thefirst agreement on conventional forces.   NATO, saying it wants results soon, proposes first reducingthree kinds of weapons.   Bush announced limits on tanks, armored troop carrriers andartillery pieces. However, he said the West is willing to includeall land-based combat aircraft and helicopters.</TEXT></DOC>
