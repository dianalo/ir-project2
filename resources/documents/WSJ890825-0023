Share prices ended higher in London, although sharply below intraday peaks. Every other major European market also showed gains.    Traders in Tokyo said buying was discouraged by a stronger dollar and by yet another sex scandal involving Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Tokuo Yamashita apologized at a news conference for an affair with a young office worker. Press reports early in the day said he had decided to resign, but Mr. Yamashita only said he was considering resigning.    Tadao Nishioka, general manager of the stock investment department of Nippon Life Insurance Co., said the Japanese market is headed for a technical correction before gathering strength for a rebound in September.    The Nikkei index of 225 issues, a 221.07-point loser Wednesday, was down 106.73 to close at 34786.55. But like Mr. Nishioka, many brokers and investors expressed optimism that the Nikkei won't fall much further. An official at Nikko Securities said the index is still near its 25-day moving average and will continue to find support at this level.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 21.50 points to 34808.05.    Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at a light 380 million shares, down from 544.6 million Wednesday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues 536-348, while 215 remained unchanged.    The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which fell 9.43 Wednesday, was down 13.05, or 0.49%, at 2630.97.    The Second Section Index, which gained 8.76 points Wednesday, was down 5.98, or 0.18%, to close at 3282.59, ending its string of 23 consecutive advances and preserving its record of a 26-day advance made in 1975. Volume on the second section was estimated at 25 million shares, compared with 34.9 million Wednesday.    Traders said a rumor that Honda Motor's consolidated first-quarter profit had fallen discouraged buying of Honda and other car makers' shares. Some of the other car makers were stronger earlier in the session but fell back.    Traders also said some other stocks that had been riding high on earnings prospects also were affected by the disappointment over Honda.    Honda announced after the close of trading that consolidated pretax profit in the quarter ended June 30 was down 40% from a year earlier to 28.39 billion yen ($198.3 million) from 47.33 billion yen despite a gain in revenue. The company cited fierce competition in the U.S. market.    Honda lost 80 to close the day at 2,040 yen a share.    Dealers and institutional investors stayed mainly on the sidelines throughout the session, and losses were spread broadly among blue-chip stocks, export-related issues and many other sectors.    Fanuc was down 120 at 6,750, TDK fell 110 to 5,990, and Nintendo was down 800 to close at 18,200.    A press report that U.S. steel manufacturers, hurt by weak domestic demand, will try to survive by increasing exports to Japan drove down prices of medium-sized Japanese steel makers, traders said. Tokyo Steel lost 120 to 4,900, Nisshin Steel was down 30 at 1,610, and Yamato Kogyo fell 60 to 1,990.    In London, severe weakening of early buying interest encouraged the market to drift toward the close. Prices shot higher in early trading as a shortage of stock among market-makers in blue-chip issues squeezed prices. But a mild opening on Wall Street and the wilting of buying interest triggered a technical correction.    Prices did perk up slightly just before the London close, as Wall Street started its climb toward a record close on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.7 points higher at 2393.1, compared with an intraday high of 2404.5. Dealers said the index spent much of the day hovering around 2400, seemingly searching for fresh inspiration to propel it convincingly through that level.    The Financial Times 30-share index rose 2.0 to 1977.9. Volume was 475.7 million shares, up from 439 million Wednesday.    Despite its lackluster afternoon, traders remain convinced that the market is poised to move higher in the near term. &quot;The market's proving remarkably resilient at these levels,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Rare outbreaks of selling by some players just prompt other people to start rubbing their hands, anticipating a bargain.&quot;    Banking shares rallied as traders decided that the sector, which has underperformed the market for some time, is reasonably priced. Dealers said the rise was accentuated by shortages of stock and aggressive U.S. investor interest.    Among the major clearing banks, Barclays rose 18 pence to 552 pence ($8.68) a share, Lloyds rose 8 to 416, Midland gained 10 to 369, and National Westminster advanced 10 to 355.    Insurance stocks rose in sympathy, with Royal Insurance climbing 15 to 455 and General Accident jumping 19 to #10.35. &quot;With the market at these (high) levels, people see financial shares as a cheap option,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The strong yields on these stocks also help provide a cushion on the down side.&quot;    B.A.T Industries rallied 23 to 866 in response to news late Wednesday that the Hoylake consortium bidding #13.4 billion for the U.K. conglomerate has conditionally lined up Axa Midi, a French-based insurance group, to buy B.A.T's Farmers Group for $4.5 billion. Dealers figured the accord would improve Hoylake's chances of clearing U.S. regulatory hurdles.    Wellcome also encountered selling pressure after its recent phenomenal rise, closing 16 lower at 720.    Shares also closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan, with the Milan stock index reaching a 1989 high. South African gold stocks closed lower.    In other Asian and Pacific markets, prices were higher in Sydney, Taipei and Seoul, mixed in Manila and lower in Hong Kong, Wellington and Singapore.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end. @ % This @ Aug 23 Aug 22 Year @ U.S. ................... 317.2 314.2 +23.9 @ Britain ................ 715.3 711.2 +31.0 @ Canada ................. 428.4 427.1 +16.7 @ Japan .................. 1562.7 1568.7 +10.0 @ France ................. 522.8 520.1 +18.1 @ Germany ................ 251.3 251.9 +20.9 @ Hong Kong .............. 1882.2 1898.8 - 7.3 @ Switzerland ............ 238.7 236.4 +38.0 @ Australia .............. 348.0 344.5 +19.9 @ World index ............ 537.2 535.5 + 8.7 </TEXT></DOC>
