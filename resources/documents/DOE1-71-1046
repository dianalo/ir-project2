An experimental unit ofthe KAB system was tested under operational conditions in the Donbass.The drilling machine with the KAB control determined borehole position,controlled drill advance rate, revolution rate and drilling depth. Useof the KAB control system increased drilling speed by about 1.3 times,drill wear declined by 2 times. Under Donbass conditions, with rock compressionstrength ranging from 7 to 9 degrees, drilling machine productivity increasedfrom 175 to 237 m of borehole per shift. Drilling accuracy and efficiencyof explosive fracturing increased.</TEXT></DOC>
