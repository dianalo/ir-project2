The dispute, in which Australia claims it is harmed by U.S.subsidies to domestic growers, surfaced as Bush formally welcomedHawke to the White House.   ``It is precisely because of the depth and the maturity of ourrelationship that the difference of views ... can be faced openlyand honestly, for example, on some trade matters _ particularlyaspects of agricultural policy,'' Hawke said in his opening remarks.   ``I am quite confident that today we will be able to focus onways to minimize, if not entirely resolve, such differences.''   Acting Assistant Secretary of State William Clark said Bush andHawke later agreed they would work through the ongoing tradeliberalization talks in Geneva to eliminate export subsidies, suchas the ones the United States has for grain under its ExportEnhancement Program.   The Bush administration wants to discontinue export subsidies,but only in the context of those multinational talks, Clark said,adding that Hawke ``is not making a demand right now that we do awaywith it.''   Hawke said Monday that although damage to Australia from the U.S.policy has lessened over the past year, ``there remains a dangerthat competitive export subsidization will again damage Australiawhen grain surpluses re-emerge.''   Clark said the United States doesn't believe its policy harmsAustralia.   The grain flap also arose during Vice President Dan Quayle'srecent visit to Australia, with Australians contending the subsidyprogram has cut into their exports to other markets and gives theU.S. growers an unfair price advantage.   While disagreeing on grain subsidies, Bush and Hawke agreed onwhat stance to take toward to China.   Hawke said he and Bush had identical views deploring andcondemning ``the barbarism'' in China, but recognized that it is intheir strategic and economic interest not to cut off ties or takemeasures that would reverse China's economic reforms.   In an arrival ceremony, Bush said Australians and Americans sharea ``pioneer heritage in the taming of two vast continents, aheritage of democratic ideas and a heritage of common sacrifice inwar and common efforts in peace.''   Hawke later told a news conference Bush and Agriculture SecretaryClayton Yeutter reacted very positively to his proposal tostrengthen the U.S. hand at the Geneva global trade talks by linkingnext year's U.S. farm legislation to progress toward the goalapproved by both countries _ eventually eliminating farm subsidies.   The prime minister said he suggested that the 1990 U.S. farm billinclude a provision that ``in the event of a positive outcome to theUruguay Round, then the provisions of the legislation would, infact, not come into effect.''   Both Australia and America want to move toward abandoning farmsubsidies, so ``it makes sense to have within the (U.S.) legislation... a position which coincides with that intention,'' Hawke said.   And it would strengthen the bargaining position ``as you go intothose negotiations which are going to be hard, detailed and sloggingbetween now and the end of 1990,'' he added.   Hawke said he and Bush ``both welcome unreservedly'' SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev's reform policies, and that he backedBush's commitment ``that with appropriate caution, he will pursueconstructively every opportunity to build upon that attitude andthat approach of President Gorbachev.''   Bush and Secretary of State James Baker had an ``overwhelminglypositive'' response to Australia's initiative to organize regionalmachinery for consultation on economic problems among the Pacificbasin countries, Hawke said. They agreed to work together in thecoming weeks for a regional consensus looking toward a ministerialconference on it later this year, he added.   The two countries disagreed, however, on U.S.-suggested arms aidfor the non-communist resistance in Cambodia and on Australia'sdecision to press for a total ban on oil drilling and mining inAntarctica, the prime minister said.   ``There are so many positive elements'' favoring prospects for apeaceful solution in Cambodia, that ``our judgment is that it'sbetter not to inject the element of lethal aid,'' Hawke said.   At a state dinner in his honor at the White House, Hawke praisedBush as a shrewd leader who has built on ``the courage of theprevious administration'' in promoting peace and moved to ``newfrontiers'' offering the greatest opportunities for peace since thebeginning of the nuclear age.   ``It takes courage, it takes strength, it takes leadership. Ittakes boldness to have done those things,'' Hawke said.   Bush said the United States has an ``abiding commitment'' toAustralia.   Referring to the troubles in China, he said that it was timelyfor the two leaders to meet and consult on issues affecting theregion.   ``Recent events in the Asia Pacific region showed that it is notenough to let a man buy what he wants. He must be allowed to saywhat he believes,'' Bush said in apparent reference to the economicreforms in China contrasted with the brutal repression ofpro-democracy demonstrations.</TEXT></DOC>
