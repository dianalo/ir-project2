Weld, who resigned March 29 as head of the Justice Department'scriminal division, said in the opinion section column in TheWashington Post on Sunday that he would not discuss the reasons forhis departure after two years in the department led by embattledAttorney General Edwin Meese III.   He wrote that the nation greatly underrates public corruption asa political and economic problem in the United States and said thatcorruption is a weed that will grow fast if left unattended, solegislation at the federal level is necessary.   ``I, for one, believe that the federal government must take anactive role in the fight against public corruption at all levels,''he said.   At a White House meeting on Wednesday, Weld and resigning DeputyAttorney General Arnold Burns painted a picture of a crippleddepartment and an attorney general wracked by legal troubles,according to sources familiar with the half-hour meeting withPresident Reagan.   Sources said Weld told the president that, if it were up to him,he would seek an indictment against Meese who has been the subjectof a lengthy investigation by an independent counsel.   In the Washington Post column, Weld said there must be a federalanti-corruption law to overcome the effects of last year's SupremeCourt decision which limited the ability of federal prosecutors tocharge local officers with abuses of public trust.   ``Another welcome step would be to apply all existinganti-corruption statutes to members of Congress,'' he said, notingthat only members of the executive branch and independent agenciesare prohibited from supplementing their salaries with fees andhonoraria for job-related activities.   Weld said he found attractive the proposal to raise the salaryof all members of Congress to between $150,000 and $175,000 whileprohibiting all honoraria.   ``One big gain would be ruling out the possibility that fees orhonoraria would influence a legislator's sense of priorities, letalone his or her vote,'' Weld wrote. ``Moreover, if members did nothave to scramble to suport their families and two residences, theywould have more time to devote to the public's business.   ``Those higher salaries might also attract to the nationallegislature at least some able women and men who would nototherwise be able to make the sacrifice,'' he said. ``We shouldcleanse the system so as to attract them.''</TEXT></DOC>
