At the same time, a three-member U.S. contingent will travel tothe Soviet Union to conduct a similar tour, Sen. Orrin Hatch saidSaturday. The visit of the Soviet technicians is scheduled forWednesday and Thursday.   Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a compound near theHercules Bacchus West plant in western Salt Lake County under termsof the INF pact, which bans production of intermediate-rangemissiles.   The treaty was signed in December by President Reagan and Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev but still faces ratification by the Senate.   The Soviet inspectors will monitor the Hercules plant, whichdeveloped motors for Pershing 2 missiles now banned under thetreaty.   The American team will be stationed in the Soviet city ofVotkinsk where SS-20 nuclear weapons were made, said Dave Porter,an aide to Hatch. Votkinsk, about 600 miles east of Moscow near theUral Mountains, has been closed to foreign visitors.   The two countries' advance teams will meet in Moscow a weekafter the tours to discuss housing, travel restrictions and otherarrangements for the inspectors, said Hatch, R-Utah.   The inspection teams could be settled in each nation within 60days of Senate ratification of the treaty.   State Department officials will accompany the Soviet technicianson a tour of the area within 31 miles of the Hercules plant. Sovietinspectors later could be allowed to travel within that zone.   Porter said this week's tours are the first of many suchmeetings planned before the inspection teams arrive.   The treaty spells out few details of living arrangements,leaving them to the two host countries.   Hatch, who has said he believes ``virtually all'' of the Sovietinspectors in Utah will be spies, has asked for a secret study ofsecurity precautions for as many as 63 government contractorslocated within a 31-mile radius of the Hercules plant.   The senator also has called for restrictions on the inspectorsto reduce the possibility of espionage. Any limitations imposedwould be reciprocal, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
