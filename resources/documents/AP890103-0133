(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When the Rev. Thomas Hooker delivered asermon one Sunday in 1638, his oratory sparked the creation of theworld's first written, democratic constitution _ one that served asa model for the U.S. Constitution.   This year marks the 350th anniversary of that document, known asthe Fundamental Orders, and the state of Connecticut plans tocelebrate with ceremony and symposiums.   The constitution, adopted on Jan. 14, 1639, also will be put onpublic display for the first time in 20 years.   In his now famous sermon, Hooker, a Congregationalist minister,asserted that the power of government lay in ``the free consent ofthe people'' and ``that the choice of public magistrates belongedunto the people, by God's own allowance.''   His words spurred free planters to adopt the Fundamental Ordersat a meeting in Hartford.   ``Throughout the Colonial period, all other states, exceptConnecticut and Rhode Island, had royal governors and were basicallyrun by an aristocracy,'' said Ralph G. Elliot, chairman of the U.S.Constitution Bicentennial Commission of Connecticut. ``No state hadgreater self government than Connecticut, starting in 1639.''   The state plans to spend $35,230 to mark the anniversary. Themain event will be a public display of the 1639 Fundamental Orders,the Royal Charter of 1662, the state consitution of 1818 and thestate constitution of 1965 at the Old State House in Hartford.</TEXT></DOC>
