The oil and gas producer said the 1987 evaluation of its proved and probable crude oil reserves in Canada and the U.S. was set at 45.9 million barrels compared with 59.7 million barrels a year earlier. Proved and probable gas reserves were estimated at 458 billion cubic feet compared with 573 billion.    Proved crude oil and natural gas reserves of 30.1 million barrels in the current evaluation were down 37% from last year's 48.1 million barrels and proved gas reserves of 300 billion cubic feet were down 21% from 381 billion reported last year, the company said.    About 90% of its total reserves were evaluated by the independent engineers, with the rest evaluated by Oakwood's staff. Besides the change in firms, Oakwood attributed the decline to its limitations on capital spending in developing reserves and the impact of price changes. </TEXT></DOC>
