BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Finance Committee voted to extend the federal borrowing limit through Sept. 30, 1988, but the extension is likely to be shortened to about two months.    The finance panel voted unanimously Friday to increase the debt limit to $2.57 trillion from the current $2.32 trillion, which matches the increase approved earlier by the House as part of the congressional budget resolution.    An increase is needed to prevent the expiration of the current debt ceiling at the end of this week.    Senate leaders expect the committee bill to be amended on the Senate floor. One amendment, expected to be bipartisan, would strengthen enforcement of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and impose across-the-board budget cuts automatically if Congress and the president can't agree on a $36 billion deficit-reduction plan for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1.    Another amendment would extend the debt ceiling only until roughly the end of the current fiscal year. Congress would thus have to vote to extend the debt ceiling again before adjournment this year.    Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee said Friday that he expects &quot;an attempt to put in the so-called Gramm-Rudman fix and to change the date&quot; of the debt-ceiling extension.    Treasury Secretary James Baker wrote to Sen. Bentsen last week warning that the government could default on its obligations if the borrowing limit isn't increased by the end of the month. He sought to extend the ceiling through the 1988 elections and into 1989 as one option, but the Finance Committee didn't consider that idea.    Congressional strategists prefer a short-term debt-ceiling extension at this time because they believe that such a measure could be kept free of extraneous amendments, such as one banning abortions. A longer-term extension could be protected from amendments, but not until the fall debate on the congressional deficit-reduction package, for which special rules apply.    A vote on a long-term debt-ceiling increase, in addition, could be used late in the fiscal year as a lever to gain budgetary concessions from the president, Democratic lawmakers believe. </TEXT></DOC>
