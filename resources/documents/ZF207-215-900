 Despite its advantages, most people felt it cost too much and was toohard to install.andM;Many still believe fiber-optic networks are out of their league.andP;  However,the costs have come down substantially and can be expected to drop further.andO;And users report fewer difficulties in installation than the faint-heartedmay fear.andM;''We expect to see a 25 percent decrease in the price of our products overthe next 12 months,'' said Chris Hawkinson, president of SimpleNet SystemsInc., a fiber LAN vendor in Brea, Calif.andP;  ''As more and more people use fibercable, the cost of the cable will come down.''andM;The expense of optical fiber is sometimes exaggerated.andP;  ''Even in 1983, fibercost about as much as Ethernet yellow cable,'' said Howard Salwen, founderand chairman of Proteon Inc., a Westboro, Mass., network vendor.andP;  Today, headded, its cost is comparable to that of IBM Type 1 cabling.andM;In cases where twisted pair is enough, however, fiber remains an extravagantsolution, Salwen said.andP;  When the alternative is more expensive coaxial cable,though, optical fiber may look quite attractive.andM;The cost of the fiber itself is not the whole story.andP;  Bits of data aretransmitted along an optical fiber as pulses of light, rather than electricalsignals.andP;  Because computers are electronic rather than optical, signals mustbe converted into optical form for transmission and reconverted at thereceiving end.andM;Tranceivers NecessaryandM;Much as a modem turns digital data into analog form for transmission overtelephone lines, fiber-optic transceivers convert a data stream to and fromoptical form.andM;These transceivers can cost under $20 for lower-speed units or up to $500 forhigh-speed models.andP;  In most cases, they're sold as part of a fiber-opticnetwork interface card that also contains circuitry found on interfaces madefor copper-wire networks.andP;  Some of these interfaces cost about $100 in thefiber-optic version; others are much more expensive.andM;''At lower speeds like 10M bps, I think we can afford to run fiber to thedesktop,'' Salwen said.andP;  But at those speeds, he added, cheaper twisted pairis probably adequate.andP;  ''I'm not sure fiber will be as ubiquitous as somepeople claim,'' he said.andM;Installation can also be a problem.andP;  If fiber is to work properly, its endsmust be carefully polished and precisely inserted in connectors.andM;Many vendors and users also recommend using experienced fiber installers.andO;They're easier to find than they once were because more fiber-optic networkshave been installed.andM;The job will be easier still with plastic optical fiber.andP;  Having been saddledwith limited distance capability in the past, plastic fiber is just nowbecoming practical for LANs.andM;To date, most fiber-optic networks are not significantly faster thanconventional LANs.andP;  Many are limited by the networking protocols they use:Datapoint Corp.'s ArcNet network operates at 2.5M bps regardless of thecabling medium, and an Ethernet LAN runs at 10M bps on fiber as well as oncoax.andM;One has had to sacrifice standards to get higher speeds -- until now.andP;  Withthe adoption of the fiber distributed data interface (FDDI), speed may becomemore of an advantage.andP;  This enhanced LAN standard, designed specifically forfiber, will allow networks to operate at 80M and 100M bps.andM;However, these networks are also more costly.andP;  FDDI will be used mostly inlarge networks and backbones, according to Greg Goodall, president ofDCA/10Net Communications, a division of Digital Communications AssociatesInc. in Dayton, Ohio.andP;  ''It's really too expensive and not needed for yournormal cluster traffic,'' he said.andM;A major advantage of optical fiber is its immunity to electromagnetic andradio-frequency interference.andP;  This means, for instance, that optical fiberfor a LAN can be strung alongside a power conduit without electricalinterference.andM;Fiber can also run from floor to floor by way of an elevator shaft, which isimpossible with copper wire because of electrical interference from theelevator's motors.andM;A more unusual benefit of this freedom from interference led Durgan-Wake andAssociates, a marine electronics firm in Newport Beach, Calif., to use fiberin a four-station network that is currently being installed in a 125-footyacht.andP;  In addition to the all-fiber LAN, said Lewie Wake, a partner atDurgan-Wake, the aluminum sailboat will have a 1,000-watt single sidebandradio transmitter.andP;  ''[The transmitter] gives us all kinds of radio-frequencyinterference all over the boat,'' he said.andM;Many of the first uses of fiber-optic networks were in military andgovernment installations -- the attraction being that optical fiber is verydifficult to tap.andP;  Fiber emits no radiation and is almost impossible tosplice into without being detected.andM;A final advantage is that optical fiber can be strung over longer distanceswithout the signal losing strength.andM;----------Grant Buckler is a Toronto-based freelance writer covering the computerindustry.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
