SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the battle between sharks and people, itturns out that the jaws most to be feared are those of humans.   The National Marine Fisheries Service announced Tuesday that thesharks in the North Atlantic may need protection.   Sharks have been overfished for a decade, resulting in a severedepletion in the western North Atlantic, the Commerce Departmentagency said.   Once a secondary product caught by fishermen seeking tuna andswordfish, sharks have become a sought-after seafood on their own,said Pat Kurkul of the Fisheries Service in Gloucester, Mass.   Shark meat is becoming common on American stores and shark finsare increasingly exported, she said.   Feared for their voraciousness, featured in such films as``Jaws'', sharks are slow to mature, have a long reproductive cycleand produce only a few offspring annually, officials said.   So serious is the concern that the Fisheries Service is takingthe extraordinary step of scheduling a series of hearings over thenext two months to discuss the problem and draft a management planfor the fish.   The plan could include setting a commercial quota, requiringpermits for commercial use and establishing recreational bag limits.   That plan could go to the secretary of commerce by February andtake effect by June, said Ms. Kurkul.   Mako is the most commonly caught and sold species of shark, butthe management plan would consider some 38 species if they arefound to be in danger, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
