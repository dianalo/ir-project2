Kestin said in an interview that the sessions were being held``near Geneva'' and included delegations representing Iran and theUnited States, and ``a mixed group'' of intermediaries. He did notelaborate.   The Nation, an English-language weekly that began publication amonth ago, reported Friday that the United States has struck asecret deal with Iran, promising economic aid and arms sales inexchange for the release of eight of the nine American hostages inLebanon, the newspaper said.   It said the deal would include the release of frozen Iranianassets in U.S. banks and the resumption of diplomatic relations.   President Reagan, White House officials and the State Departmentall denied the report.   According to the Nation, which quoted unidentified sources inGeneva, Iran would secure the release of five American hostages onor around Oct. 7. A second group of hostages, including threeAmericans and a Briton _ possibly Terry Waite, a special envoy ofthe Archbishop of Canterbury _ would be released a week later, thereport said.   All are believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran.   ``We are not negotiating directly with Iran,'' Reagan toldreporters Friday. ``We have not talked to the kidnappers. I thinkmaybe Iran is putting these stories out.''   Asked about the denials, Kestin said: ``I think there probablyare very strong reasons why Reagan and the whole administration arebacking off the story. But I think everyone is taking itseriously.''   The U.S. Embassy in Israel was following the hostage situation,``but the denials from Washington stand,'' according to an embassyofficial who requested anonymity.   Seventeen foreign hostages are held in Lebanon. The hostage heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying tonegotiate the release of hostages.   In Beirut on Saturday, kidnappers holding three Americaneducators and an Indian professor said they would release onehostage to increase U.S. support for Palestinians in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The group, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free,or when.   The wife of U.S. hostage Jesse Turner, a professor ofmathematics and computor science, said Sunday she was hopeful thather husband, two other American educators and an Indian colleaguewill be freed soon after their captors release one of them.   ``This is an encouraging sign. I hope the captors will fulfilltheir promise to release one of the hostages, whoever they chooseto free, because that would mean the others have a much betterchance,'' Badr Turner said in Beirut on Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
