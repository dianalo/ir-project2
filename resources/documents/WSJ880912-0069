Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, predicted that the bank board would close or merge as many as 48 more insolvent institutions before its fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Since Aug. 18 alone it has provided $11 billion in financial assistance to arrange mergers or acquistions for 49 sick thrifts. For the year, it has closed or merged 102.    But the Bank Board could face a threat to steps it has taken to increase its expertise in regulation, finance and real estate management. The General Accounting Office, an arm of the Congress, has concluded that the board has been illegally exempting employees in three subsidiaries from federal salary caps. The agency is due to announce that finding, reported Saturday by the Washington Post, in a report to be released today.    The immediate impact of the finding wasn't clear. But Bank Board spokesman Karl Hoyle said it could be &quot;devastating&quot; if the troubled agency is forced to cut the pay of top executives in the units, and as a result loses the officials who have brought it new talents. But he said it appeared unlikely that such a step would be required without court action or new legislation.    The latest merger transaction will turn over five Texas thrifts to Pulte Diversified Cos., a subsidiary of PHM Corp., Bloomfield Hills, Mich., one of the largest homebuilders in Texas and the nation.    Federal officials named only four of the institutions Pulte will acquire in Texas: Allenpark Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Houston; Bay City Federal Saving andamp; Loan Association, Bay City; Gulf Coast, Richmond; and Heights Savings Association, Houston. They had $928.5 million in liabilities. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will provide an estimated $556.9 million in assistance for the four, officials said.    Officials wouldn't identify the fifth institution, or its cost to the FSLIC, but they implied that it is comparable in size to the four that were named.    Thrift ownership by a major homebuilder could raise some controversy, since some of the most egregious Sandamp;L failures in the past occurred after they were taken over by real estate developers who used them to finance risky projects.    Pulte officials could not be reached for comment.    Stuart Root, director of the FSLIC, said the insurance agency imposed limitations on transactions between Pulte affiliates that are &quot;extensive, intricate, complete and pervasive.&quot; But Mr. Root said Pulte's thrifts wouldn't be barred from lending to its homebuilding enterprise. The main control on its activities, he suggested, was that Pulte would have to report to regulators on such dealings quarterly, and the Bank Board's supervisory agent would have broad discretion to stop questionable activity.    Pulte is due to invest $45 million in the five thrifts within a year, the Bank Board said. Initially, Pulte will put up $15.5 million to acquire four of the institutions, with another $6.2 million to come later. For the unnamed fifth thrift, it will make investments of $14.5 million soon and $8.8 million within 12 months.    Pulte has been seeking to buy insolvent thrifts in Texas for more than a year. It previously bid unsuccessfully on State Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Lubbock, which recently was acquired by a Texas-based unit of MeraBank, Phoenix, Ariz.    The Bank Board's aid for the Pulte mergers comes in the form of a $311 million note from FSLIC to cover much of the thrifts' negative net worth, and guarantees of principal and interest payments on 60% of the thrifts' bad loans, officials said.    The GAO's findings about executive salaries affects the Bank Board's crucial new Office of Regulatory Activities, which oversees regulation of the thrift industry. The office is credited with sharply upgrading the board's financial expertise and tightening thrift supervision in the past year. But it has done so largely by paying salaries that range over $100,000, to attract top executives from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and elsewhere.    The GAO's conclusions also cover the board's Federal Asset Disposition Association, which has paid six-figure salaries to attract experts in managing and selling real estate. FADA tries to dispose of real estate and other assets taken over by the Bank Board as receiver for closed thrifts. The board's Office of Finance, which arranges debt offerings for the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks, also could be affected. </TEXT></DOC>
