Domestic violence is not just a series ofsimple disputes or family quarrels. It is not just an isolated incidentor private matter to be quietly settled, forgiven, and forgotten. Domesticviolence is a serious crime that tears at the fabric of the American family.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Each year, hundreds of thousands of Americans_Americans of every age,race, and gender, and from every social, religious, and economic background_areharmed in their homes by a loved one. It is estimated that one-third ofall domestic violence incidents involve felonies, including rape, aggravatedassult, and robbery. Domestic violence is the single largest cause of injuryto women in the United States, and research has shown that persons whoengage in one form of family violence are likely to engage in others. Researchersare just beginning to understand the extent of injuries suffered by menas a result of domestic violence, particularly in their advanced years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The suffering of those children who are abused, or who witness incidentsof domestic violence, is inestimable. Domestic violence deprives theselittle ones of the innoicence, joy, and security of childhood_and nothingcan replace their loss.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In recent years, the number of shelters and safehouses for batteredadults and children has increased dramatically. This month, we recognizethe dedicated professionals and volunteers who provide these vital servicesto the victims of domestic violence. These generous, hard-working men andwomen merit our respect and gratitude.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, because many abused individuals continue to need assistance,we must also recognize the importance of supporting private and publicefforts to aid victims of domestic violence. Public awareness and understandingof the needs of battered adults and children must be increased. This month,let us renew our determination to learn more about the problem of domesticviolence and how each of us can help bring an end to it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 133, has designated October1989 as ``National Domestic Violence Awareness Month'' and has authorizedand requested the President to issue a proclamation in observence of thismonth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim October 1989 as National Domestic ViolenceAwareness Month. I urge all Americans to become more aware of the tragedyof domestic violence; to support and assist victims and those who are workingto eliminate domestic violence in our land; and to participate in otherappropriate efforts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh dayof October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, andof the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred andfourteenth.<ITAG tagnum="65">andPres;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 89-24433</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 10-12-89; 11:57 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing code 3195-01-M<FTAG tagnum="4705"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 1989</ITAG><FTAG tagnum="4705"/></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="90"><T4>Federal Register</T4> / Vol. 54, No. 197 / Friday, October 13, 1989/ Presidential Documents<ITAG tagnum="40">Proclamation 6044 of October 11, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="41">National Job Skills Week, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The observance of National Job Skills Week, 1989, gives all Americansan opportunity to reflect on the changes taking place in our economy andwork force. Today, the United States  continues to hold a position of leadershipin global economic affairs_with most Americans enjoying a high standardof living, employment levels continuing to increase, and unemployment fallingto the lowest levels more than a decade. In large part, this leadershipreflects the flexibility, creativity, and commitment to excellencen amongAmerican workers and employers, as well as the quality of our educationaland training institutions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, the United States faces a serious challenge that must bedealt with immediately and directly. An increasingly competitive internationaleconomy requires that our labor force have improved skills_skills necessaryto adapt to technological advances in the workplace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">At the same time, demographic changes are altering the compositionof our labor force. Trends indicate that, during the next decade, fewernew young workers will be entering the labor market, and the average ageof the work force will rise significantly. Workers without adequate educationor training will likely  make up a larger share of the entrants into thework force. These trends underscore the importance of providing retrainingfor older workers and employment opportunities for those Americans who,in the past, have not been able to compete in the labor market due to lackof education or occupational skills.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">We must reaffirm our commitment to bringing disadvantaged and unemployedAmericans into the labor market so that they, too, can experience the rewardsof productive employment and self-sufficiency. Such a commitment is notonly a moral imperative, but also vital to maintaining our Nation's prosperityand economic growth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The centerpiece of the Federal Government's efforts to meet this challengeand commitment is the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Through theJTPA, private and governmental efforts are combined to provide needed trainingand assistance to individuals seeking private sector employment. The JTPAhas been an extremely successful program, but it can be improved. The JTPAhas been an extremely successful program, but it can be improved. Amendmentsunder consideration would target assistance and training to those who facethe most serious barriers to employment; enhance the quality of servicesprovided; and promote coordination of human resource programs serving thedisadvantaged.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, the Family Support Act of 1988_last year's landmark welfarereform legislation_moves us in the direction of including job trainingand education in our welfare system. Similarly, proposed changes to theCarl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, now being considered, would emphasizestudent achievement in acquiring basic skills and occupational competence.Effective implementation of these programs can make a critical contributionto our efforts to train unskilled and disadvantaged Americans and bringthem into the economic mainstream.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">To focus national attention on prsent and future work force needs,the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 148, has designated the week ofOctober 8 through October 14, 1989, as ``National Job Skills Week'' andhas authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observanceof this week.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim the week of October 8 through October 14, 1989,as National Job Skills Week.
