In recent months, the first anti-apartheid newspaper publishedin Afrikaans has doubled its circulation to 8,000 and providedpublicity for a new wave of alternative culture.   Three anti-establishment Afrikaner rock bands have been drawingenthusiastic crowds at campuses and theaters during anunprecedented nationwide tour.   The movement is small as yet.   Most Afrikaner children grow up in tight-knit, conservativefamilies and attend rigid state schools where curriculum istailored to fit government ideology. Young white men must serve twoyears in the military, prolonging the period in which they arescreened from other ways of thinking.   ``Afrikaners have a very authoritarian tradition _ children aremeant to be seen and not heard,'' said Max du Preez, editor of the7-month-old newspaper Vrye Weekblad (Free Weekly). ``This hasretarded the growth of young people. We're all late bloomers.''   Du Preez's newspaper is aimed both at readers who already havebroken with apartheid and at those who still condone the concept ofwhite-minority rule under the National Party government.   ``We have a converting role, a responsibility to stimulateAfrikaners who are on the verge of breaking away and to provide anew home for them,'' du Preez, 37, said in an interview. ``It'sbeen a very lonely place to be, to be an Afrikaner who has brokenwith apartheid.''   It doesn't seem lonely at the boisterous concerts of the Voelvry(Free Bird) rock `n' roll tour, which succeeded despite beingbanned from several places. One of the touring groups is called DieSwart Gevaar _ ``The Black Menace'' _ and is a phrase used indescribing whites' fears of a black majority takeover.   Dirk Uys, manager of another group called the GereformeerdeBlues Band, told one music writer: ``We're bringing home a lot ofthose homeless people who have never been able to identify with thecurrent state of Afrikaans culture.''   Says the leader of the Blues Band, Johannes Kerkorrel: ``If youcan make a language into rock `n' roll, it can't be an oppressivelanguage any more.''   Along with the alternative music movement is an upsurge inprovocative, topical Afrikaans drama, with new works surfacingregularly from university-based playwrights.   ``This radical school of dramatists challenges and evenundermines the principles and mores on which Afrikanerdom isbased,'' said The Weekly Mail, an English-language anti-apartheidnewspaper.   About 60 percent of South Africa's 5 million whites areAfrikaners, descendants of Dutch and other European settlers whobegan arriving here 337 years ago. Only in 1948 did the Afrikanerstake full control of the government, and they proceeded to enactthe harsh segregation laws of apartheid, force millions of blacksfrom their homes, and suppress campaigns for black rights.   Small numbers of Afrikaners have opposed apartheid since the1960s, and their ranks have grown since the widespread black unrestof 1984-86, but most remain opposed to black majority rule anduninterested in learning about other political perspectives.   Mike Joubert, who last year was president of the student councilat the University of Pretoria, said most of the 22,000 students atthe Afrikaans-language school were preoccupied with academics andsocial life and had ``a very strong antipathy toward any kind ofpolitical activity.''   ``They were very uninformed,'' said Joubert, a nephew of ForeignMinister Pik Botha. ``They accept anything they read or see ontelevision.''   Only a few hundred students were active in either left-wing orright-wing political groups, said Joubert, who is now in businessschool. Many of the others might accept major political reforms butwould need to be led in that direction, he said.   At the University of Stellenbosch, the most prestigiousAfrikaans university, a slightly more liberal mood prevails. A banon the Voelvry tour provoked emotional protests, and there waswidespread support for a group of 18 students who went to Zambia inApril to participate in forums that included members of theoutlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.   The Dutch Reformed Church, by far the largest Afrikanerdenomination, has suffered fewer defections of young people thanmajor Protestant churches in the West, according to Dr. PierreRoussouw, a senior church official.   He said more than 90 percent of the youths who are baptized bythe church complete the process that leads to adult membership.Services at university chapels are packed, he said.   ``There are victims of secularization, and we're worried aboutthat,'' he said. ``But we have much to be thankful for.''   One of the factors behind the church's strength, said Roussouw,is Christian National Education, the education system at whitepublic schools that promotes Afrikaner nationalism,Calvinist-oriented Bible study, and a white-oriented view ofhistory.   The Dutch Reformed Church has repudiated its former endorsementof apartheid, but Roussouw said it would never abandon its supportof Christian National Education.   ``We sometimes underestimate the power of the school system.''said du Preez. ``It's a very potent force _ the history courses,the language, Bible study, praying for the president, raising theflag.''   Most Afrikaners in their 20s and 30s sense that black majorityrule is inevitable, du Preez said, but they have deep worries anduncertainties about how that change will affect them.   ``I feel so sad as I look at my people _ they're the most unfreepeople in this country,'' he said. ``They're resented by everybodyelse. They're angry and afraid and confused.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, May 25</NOTE></DOC>
