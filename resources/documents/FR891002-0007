The agency has concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturerconcerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its safety andefficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulationsshould be amended in part 455 (21 CFR part 455) by adding new andSection;455.4, redesignating andSection; 455.204 as andSection; 455.204a, and addingnew andSection;andSection; 455.204 and 455.204b to provide for the inclusionof accepted standards for this product.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Submitting Comments and Filing Objections</ITAG>This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a requestfor approval of an antibiotic drug. Because this final rule is not controversialand because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDAfinds that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the publicinterest. This final rule, therefore, is effective November 1, 1989. However,interested persons may, on or before November 1, 1989, submit commentsto the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any commentsare to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Commentsare to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the headingof this document. Received comments may be seen in the Dockets ManagementBranch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objectionsto it and request a hearing. Reasonable grounds for the hearing must beshown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or beforeNovember 1, 1989, a written notice of participation and request for hearing,and (2) on or before December 1, 1989, the data, information, and analyseson which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR314.300. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations ordenials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuineand substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusivelyappears from the face of the data, information, and factual analyses inthe request for hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludesthe action taken by this order, or if a request for hearing is not madein the required format or with the required analyses, the Commissionerof Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) whorequest(s) the hearing, making findings and conclusions and denying a hearing.All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the docketnumber appearing in the heading of this order and filed with the DocketsManagement Branch.The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participationand request for hearing, a submission of data, information, and analysesto justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearingare contained in 21 CFR 314.300.All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibitedfrom public disclosure under 21 U.S.C. 331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may beseen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 455</ITAG>Antibiotics.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authoritydelegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR part 455 is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 455_CERTAIN OTHER ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS</ITAG>1.
