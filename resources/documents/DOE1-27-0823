Actual energy supply and demand in 1986 isdiscussed for these energy sources. Trends in 4 major-energy consumingindustries and their energy consumption are reviewed - steel industry,paper/pulp industry, cement industry and petrochemical industry. In theseindustries, falling exports, increasing imports and depressed productionwere present caused by the Yen's appreciation. In energy consumption,downward trends, changing competitive relations and growing ratios ofinexpensive in-plant generation all occurred. Prospects for fiscal 1987are discussed for energy supply and demand. It is suggested that upturnsin energy supply and final energy consumption can be expected. The paceof the yen's appreciation is decelerating, and the government policyto stimulate local demand should produce some effects. The commercial/residentialand transport sectors are expected to increase their energy demand by2-3%. There is therefore expected to be an increase in energy supplyand demand of 1-2% in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
