 Unlike other programs, PreScript allows userto print from within an application.andP;  In addition, the productsupplies a Windows-based utility for Microsoft Windows users,allowing them to see an on-screen bitmapped preview.andP;  Although thetest PostScript files were quick to print out, broken or jaggedoutput was produced when heavy lines were used to draw vectorcurves.andP;  PreScript also requires a minimum of 2Mbyte of extendedmemory, although the company is planning an upgrade that willreduce memory requirements.andP;  PreScript is priced at $195 for the13-font version, and $395 for the 35-font version.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Pan Overseas Computer (products).andO;Product:   PostScript (Printer software) (product enhancement)PreScript (Interpreter).andO;Topic:     EvaluationInterpreters.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PreScript: PostScript Interpreter is Long on Convenience, Short on TrueCompatibility In an attempt to distinguish itself from the growing number ofPostScript software interpreters, PreScript, from Pan Overseas Computer(POC), emphasizes convenience.andP;  Unlike its competitors, which require you toprint from DOS or to create virtual ports, PreScript lets you print fromwithin your applications.andP;  As a TSR, the program hides in the background,intercepts a PostScript file on its way to the parallel port, compiles thecode, and transmits PCL-compatible information instead.andM;Conveniences increase for Microsoft Windows users.andP;  PreScript supplies aWindows-based utility, Preview, that automatically pops up when you print afile, and displays a bit-mapped representation of the page.andP;  Use Preview fora few days and you'll discover the inadequacies of Windows's WYSIWYG display.andO;During testing, for example, Samna's Windows-based word processor Ami showedthat line spacing for a headline in 32-point Helvetica was tight, but none ofthe letterforms touched.andP;  Preview accurately matched the paper output,showing where the ascenders and descenders of certain letters overlapped.andM;Preview's simple menu lets you scroll through multiple page documents, view apage in one of three zoom modes, and easily disable PreScript in order toreturn to direct HP printer operation.andP;  Users of non-Windows programs mustawkwardly shell out to DOS, and use a software switch to disable the memoryresident portion of PreScript.andM;PreScript has a lot in common with other software interpreters.andP;  LikeGoScript and Freedom of Press, it provides the original 13 Apple Laser-Writertypefaces for $195, or the 35 typefaces of the Laser-Writer IINTX for $395.andO;And like its main competitor, UltraScript, PreScript is fast, beating theLaserWriter IINTX by a considerable margin.andP;  In part, this occurs because theprogram uses parallel, not serial, printer connections.andM;Pan Overseas Computer claims that I/O speeds can be further boosted byinstalling its $295 proprietary Laser Interface Cards.andP;  Although these twocards (one of which resides in an 8-bit slot in your PC, another in the HPLaserJet Series II expansion slot) use high-speed video transmission via anRJ-11-type phone wire to bypass the parallel port, the performanceimprovements will vary significantly depending on the nature of the image.andO;With PostScript files containing mostly vector information, test images didprint out two to three times faster with the cards than with the PreScriptsoftware alone.andP;  However, the PC Labs graphics test includes severalhigh-resolution bitmaps, and revealed only a marginal 10 percent speed gain.andM;The POC Laser Interface Cards take direct control of the LaserJet's engine,making it possible to feed the printer one scan line at a time.andP;  Feeding theprinter incrementally makes it unnecessary to upgrade your printer's memory.andO;Users who install the card will be able to print a full page of300-dot-per-inch graphics with only 512K of printer memory in their HPLaserJet Series II.andM;Convenience is no substitute for performance, however.andP;  Although our testPostScript files printed quickly, the images revealed that when heavy linesare used to draw vector curves, PreScript will produce broken or jaggedoutput.andP;  Bitmapped photographs suffered from noticeable posterization makingit impossible to reproduce the subtle gray tones in the PC-Lab test image.andO;POC claims that the fix for this problem will be shipping by the time youread this article.andM;PreScript requires a minimum of 2MB of extended memory in order to operate,and supplies drivers only for the HP DeskJet or HP LaserJet family ofprinters (or compatibles).andP;  Again, the company is planning an upgrade thatwill reduce the memory requirements and support other laser printers.andP;  Butfor now, PreScript's substantial hardware requirements and flawed outputlimit its usefulness for its already limited audience--Windows users lookingfor an easy way to preview PostScript pages.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
