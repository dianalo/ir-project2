The giant oil company thus became the 81st U.S. concern to complete the sale or transfer of its assets in South Africa since 1984, when racial unrest intensified there, according to a group that tracks U.S. business in South Africa, the Investor Responsibility Research Center. The organization said that at least a dozen more companies have said they plan to leave.    The highly visible oil companies have been under particularly heavy pressure from anti-apartheid activists who see disinvestment as a way to force South Africa's white minority government to share power with the black majority. Ashland Oil Co. already has phased out its operations there, said David Hauck, an analyst with the Washington-based organization. But unlike Mobil Corp. and CalTex, a joint venture of Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp., neither Ashland nor Exxon has oil refineries in South Africa. Exxon's South African units sell petroleum and chemical products.    &quot;What Exxon does in South Africa is different,&quot; said Mr. Hauck. &quot;Just because Exxon has pulled out, I don't see other oil companies following suit.&quot;    Exxon said it chose to set up a trust because it was unable to sell its South African operations to local interests.    &quot;The deterioration of the South African economic and business climate caused by the continuing internal and external constraint has affected our business and its potential growth,&quot; said Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon's president. &quot;In view of the fact that we were not able to sell our operations, we did not want to shut them down and abandon our employees. Consequently, the trust was established.&quot;    Other major U.S. companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Fluor Corp., have set up similar trusts.    In Johannesburg, the Exxon announcement intensified speculation that the tempo of disinvestments will continue in the new year. South African business and industry associations worry that recent U.S. congressional rules prohibiting American companies from making new investments in South African operations could cripple those units competitively.    To avoid a possible confict with those regulations, Exxon established the independent trust on the Channel Islands' Isle of Jersey and then lent money to the trust to buy the South African affiliates. A spokeswoman said the &quot;trust arrangements were reviewed with the U.S. government, which took no exception to them.&quot;    Under the arrangement, local management will operate the companies and use proceeds to pay for the purchase. Exxon didn't disclose the sale price. It did say, however, that revenues from the two companies accounted for just 0.2% of Exxon's $92.87 billion in 1985 revenue. According to Investor Responsibility Research Center, the companies were valued at $7 million at the end of 1984.    Exxon said the trust will use additional income to support social responsibility programs and in a profit-sharing program for the companies' about 200 employees, about half of whom are non-white.    The companies will cease using the Exxon and Esso brand names &quot;over the next few months,&quot; the Exxon spokeswoman said. She said the companies are free to obtain supplies from companies other than Exxon. In addition, she said, Exxon doesn't hold any repurchase options or first rights of refusal to buy back shares in the South African operations.    Some anti-apartheid supporters were encouraged by the move. Donna Katzin, director of South Africa programs for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which has sponsored shareholder proposals urging U.S. companies to leave South Africa, said that group was &quot;very heartened by Exxon's announcement that it will be selling its assets, and we feel that this reflects Exxon's sensitivity to the campaign over the past few years. . . . &quot; She said she expects other oil companies to follow suit.    But one of them, Mobil, with 1,200 service stations in South Africa and about 3,100 employees -- over half of whom are nonwhite -- said it doesn't plan to leave. &quot;If we were to withdraw, it would hurt black South Africans most, and many prominent black South Africans agree with our position and support it,&quot; said John Lord, a company spokesman.    Ms. Katzin said she was concerned, meanwhile, because Exxon is continuing to honor existing licensing and technical agreements. &quot;Until the entire flow of products and service ends, Exxon will continue to oil the wheels of apartheid,&quot; she said. </TEXT></DOC>
