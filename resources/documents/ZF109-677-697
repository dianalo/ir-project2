Daniels' opinion said CSC did not gain an unfairadvantage through Treasury's mistakes.andP;  Andersen failed to show how theseinfractions altered the procurement's outcome, he concluded.andM;&quot;Any good lawyer can pick lint off any government procurement, pundits say.andO;We will not set aside an award, even if violations of law are found, unlessthose violations have some significance,&quot; Daniels wrote.andP;  &quot;Andersen has notexplained, or even given us material from which we migh fashion anexplanation, how the result of the competition might have been changed if theviolations had not occurred.&quot;andM;FMS and CSC never stopped work on the project, because Andersen failed tofile its protest in time to suspend the procurement.andM;Treasury officials have touted System 90 as FMS' largest ADP buy ever.andP;  TheOffice of Management and Budget designated the project a PresidentialPriority System for its role in modernizing federal financial processing.andM;System 90 will upgrade FMS' operations by replacing unconnected and divergentcomputers with an integrated system architecture and communications network.andO;The system will link FMS' seven regional finance centers electronically tosupport payments, claims, reclamations, cash management, agency accountingand credit administration.andM;Andersen charged that the CA-Datacom/PC software from Computer AssociatesInternational Inc. that CSC bid was not commercially available at the time ofBAFO submissions.andM;The board agreed, noting the Treasury evaluator assumed wrongly that theproduct was beyond beta testing in May.andP;  But the component was not &quot;vaporware&quot; and Andersen did not assert that its own proposal would have beenimproved if it too could have offered CA-Datacom/PC or similar products, theboard said.andM;Treasury also violated procurement ground rules by allowing CSC to bypass asecond unwitnessed benchmark, after requiring such a test of Andersen whenthe company changed its proposal.andP;  CSC officials said they had problemspreparing a benchmark test for the complex system.andM;The board, however, said the second benchmark requirement becameinsignificant when CSC passed a later, government-witnessed test using thequestionable configuration of hardware and software.andM;&quot;This violation must stik in Andersen's craw,&quot; Daniels said.andM;Andersen also had alleged CSC's $48.8 million bid was part of a &quot;buy-in&quot;scheme, where CSC planned to recover initial losses by charging high pricesfor contract modifications.andM;But the board concluded CSC achieved savings by offering reconditionedequipment, and Andersen failed to prove Treasury's pricing analyses wereunrealistic.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
