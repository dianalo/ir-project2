Here's the amazing &quot;unpredictabilitytheory&quot; now being propounded by the FDA's Ken Feather, branchchief of drug marketing surveillance, as reported byAdvertising Age: &quot;We used to say that if a company madecertain changes, then we would probably not take any action.Now we won't. Now, even if they make the changes, they mightend up in court. We want to say to these companies that youdon't know when or how we'll strike. We want to eliminatepredictability.&quot; Then there's Forest Service spokesman MattMathes on halting timber sales in the Sierra Nevada on behalfof spotted owls: &quot;This was the direction we were moving inalready. Instead of looking at just the individual timbersale, we will look at the entire ecosystems in which ourtimber sales take place.&quot; It's been a long time since anyadministration countenanced such regulatory ambition.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
