<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0420 </DOCNO><TEXT>A hydrogen-injected engine system is developed which is equipped witha liquid hydrogen pump driven by a high-pressure hydrogen gas motor.The system is provided with a 1952cc water-cooled, vertical-injectiondiesel engine of a heated face ignition type. Preliminary addition ofpart of the hydrogen to the inlet pipe reduces noise and NOx as wellas vibrations associated with the combustion pressure, though the thermalefficiency decreases. The system can recover hydrogen evaporating fromthe liquid hydrogen tank. Spark ignition can also serve well if the timingof hydrogen injection and spark ignition is adjusted appropriately, althoughvibration cannot be eliminated if the preliminary mixture is low in concentration.In the present system, however, the concentration of the preliminarymixture can be increased without causing early ignition that may reducethe performance. A high-pressure hydrogen gas motor operating on evaporationand expansion of liquid hydrogen is developed which reduces the powerrequired for the liquid hydrogen pump. Exhaust gas from the motor isefficiently recycled for preliminary mixing in the inlet pipe. The pumpcan be driven satisfactorily if 12 percent of the hydrogen dischargedfrom the liquid hydrogen pump is supplied to the gas motor. Further studiesare expected to make significant improvements.
