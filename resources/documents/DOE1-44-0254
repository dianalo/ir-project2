HIC's must be designed to meeta variety of shipping, handling and burial requirements and must containthe waste without loss of integrity for at least 300 years. This paperreviews the design requirements and describes a new &quot;hybrid&quot; HIC madeof a stainless steel outer shell and an inner liner of polyethylene.The hybrid HIC utilizes to advantage the structural properties of thestainless steel and the corrosion resistance of the polyethylene.</TEXT></DOC>
