The proposal, which contains several major departures fromcurrent procedures, must be cleared by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., and elements of it would requirelegislation. Without specifically endorsing every detail ofthe proposal, FDIC Chairman William Seidman voiced generalsupport for the plan over the weekend. The industry itselfstill must agree on several details.</LP><TEXT>   The industry accord meets requirements set by the FDIC andthe Bush administration and aims to replenish the shrinkingdeposit-insurance fund without using taxpayer money orboosting bank costs by an amount that could significantlyworsen the current credit crunch.   Under the proposal, the industry will loan $10 billion tothe FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund to help it bear the cost ofbank failures. The lending would take the form of bondsissued by the fund to the banking industry. The bonds couldbe resold in the secondary market.   In addition, the plan suggests that the Federal ReserveBoard lend up to $2 billion to the fund to help keep banksfrom failing by assisting their acquisition or merger intohealthy banks. Under this novel proposal, the money wouldcome from the reserves that banks are required to post at theFed. Although the Federal Reserve Board may not like thisproposal, there's growing congressional interest in involvingthe Fed in measures to support the insurance fund.   The banks believe the insurance fund would be able to paythe interest and principal on the bonds by adding about fourcents to the current premium of 19.5 cents per $100 ofdomestic deposits. However, the additional money would comefrom a special assessment against bank assets, rather thanfrom the current charge on domestic deposits.   The asset-based assessment would ease the burden on themajority of banks at the expense of a dozen or so largebanks, such as Citicorp's Citibank unit and J.P. Morgan andamp;Co.'s Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. unit, that depend heavily onforeign deposits for funds. The potential opposition from bigbanks makes this change the most controversial part of theproposal.   The current premium of 19.5 cents is assessed only againstdomestic deposits because deposit insurance doesn'tspecifically cover foreign deposits. However, the FDIC oftenends up protecting foreign deposits, as well as accounts thatexceed the $100,000 deposit-insurance ceiling, as part of the&quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; doctrine. Under this doctrine, the FDIC andFederal Reserve protect large, troubled banks in order tomaintain stability in the financial system.   Smaller banks have long argued that it's unfair to basepremiums on domestic deposits alone because large banksalmost always are judged too big to fail, forcing the BankInsurance Fund to protect foreign and other uninsureddeposits.   As part of its proposal, the industry plans to press thegovernment to modify the too-big-to-fail doctrine to requirethe Treasury or the Federal Reserve Board, rather than theFDIC, to pay the cost of covering uninsured deposits. Such achange would reduce costs to the banking industry, whichfunds deposit insurance, and raise the political visibilityof decisions to protect uninsured depositors.   &quot;I think they have a very good argument in that regard,&quot;Mr. Seidman said. The Treasury's recent proposal to overhaulthe banking system proposes some limits on thetoo-big-too-fail doctrine, but doesn't go as far as theindustry's proposal.   The industry plan fits well within a Bank Insurance Fundrecapitalization plan Mr. Seidman outlined to Congress lastweek. The three-member FDIC board must vote this month toboost premiums in order to meet the legal-notice requirementsfor putting an increase in place by July 1. Each one-centincrease in the premium generates about $250 million. TheFDIC's vote is likely to recommend a premium increase basedon the current base of domestic deposits; a broader basewould require congressional action.   At a time when some banks, particularly in the Northeast,are losing money as they write off bad real estate loans, theindustry has worked hard to hold premium increases as low aspossible. &quot;I don't see any way we can push that premium upabove the 23-cent to 24-cent level,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. &quot;Thatwould be totally nonproductive&quot; because higher premiums wouldtrigger the failure of some weak banks.</TEXT></DOC>
