The biomass producedby plants, be they terrestrial or aquatic, has become one of the bestsources of renewable energy. The latest developments in both researchand applied technology are discussed for such biomass feedstocks as grasses,tree crops, root crops, hydrocarbon plants, and fresh and salt wateraquatic plants. The tropical grasses such as sugar cane and napier grassand tree crop species appear to have received major attention as leadingsources of biomass feedstock. The harvest, transport, utilization andconversion, of this biomass to energy products are discussed with examplesof the latest developments in direct combustion, pyrolysis, gasification,aerobic and anaerobic fermentation, liquefaction, and production of chemicalsfrom biomass.</TEXT></DOC>
