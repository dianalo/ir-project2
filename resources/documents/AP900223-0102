It was the first formal statement by the PLO leader that he hasapproved terms for Israeli-Palestinian talks, although there havebeen hints from Cairo that he was moving in that direction.   Arafat said in the letter that the PLO would prefer aninternational peace conference and ``guarantees that can only beprovided by the great powers and the United Nations.''   But he added: ``The PLO once more leaned over backward andapproved the idea of a dialogue between representatives of theIsraeli government and representatives of the Palestinian people inthe occupied territories and the diaspora.''   He said that such talks would have to be part of a process``aimed at a comprehensive and final settlement'' and that itsagenda ``could cover all the conceptual ingredients of thatprocess, including the elections and the 10 Egyptian points.''   The ``10 Egyptian points'' were recommendations put forward byEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak to try to get a concensus withIsrael on preliminary peace talks.   Mubarak, backed by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III,has offered to host an initial Israeli-Palestinian dialogue aimedat reviving stalled Middle East peace efforts.   Those talks are expected to help clear the way forIsraeli-proposed elections in the occupied territories leading tolimited autonomy of the areas' 1.7 million Palestinian residents.Hundreds of Palestinians and more than 40 Israelis have been killedin the Palestinian uprising in the territories.   Efforts to get the talks under way have been stalled by Israeliconcerns over the composition of the Palestinian delegation and theagenda.   Israeli, which refuses to deal with the PLO as a ``terroristgroup,'' has not yet agreed to participate in the prelimintarytalks urged by Mubarak.   Arafat's letter was sent to a meeting in Jerusalem by Jewishpeace activists called the Special Emergency World JewishLeadership Peace Conference, which concluded Thursday.   Rita Hauser, a New York peace activist who attended theconference, told reporters that the letter was received ``through acircuitious manner, via fax'' on Thursday but that conferenceleaders had been unable to ``get it fitted in'' amid theconference's heavy schedule.   It was presented at a board meeting today of the Tel Aviv-basedInternational Center for Peace in the Middle East, which sponsoredthe conference.   Ms. Hauser, an attorney and head of the center's Americanbranch, met with Arafat in Stockholm in December 1988. Hauser saidshe had been in fax contact with the PLO since that meeting.   Shortly after their meeting, Arafat made a series of historicannouncements recognizing Israel's right to exist and renouncingterrorism. Those statements led, in turn, to the United Statesresuming contacts with the PLO for the first time since 1975.   Arafat's letter to the Jerusalem meeting of Jewish peaceadvocates was dated Feb. 17 and came from Tunis, where the PLO isheadquartered. There was no explanation for the delay in itstransmittal to Jerusalem.   In the letter, Arafat repeated the PLO's call for creation of anindependent Palestinian state in the occupied territories, whichwere captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 MiddleEast war.   ``We remain deeply convinced that the only real securityguarantee for Israel lives in a peaceful settlement based on thetermination of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arabterritories and the acceptance of the two-state principle,'' hewrote.   Arafat noted that Israel has been fearful of dealing with thePLO, and said that Palestinians had similar concerns about dealingwith the Jewish state.   ``Watching the convoluted maneuvers the Israeli government hasengaged in and the massive obstacles with which it has littered thepath to peace, the Palestinian people are not filled withconfidence in the good intentions of the Israeli leaders,'' Arafatwrote.   He continued: ``To them, the only guarantee of their ownsecurity and their political future lies in the full participationof the PLO in all stages of the peace process.''   Such a role has been ruled out by Israeli Prime Minister YitzhakShamir. In an interview published today in The Jerusalem Post,Shamir was asked what the PLO could do to make itself an acceptablenegotiating partner.   ``The only thing it should do is dismantle itself,'' Shamirreplied. ``Because its minimal demand is a Palestinian state, and aPalestinian state cannot co-exist with Israel.''</TEXT></DOC>
