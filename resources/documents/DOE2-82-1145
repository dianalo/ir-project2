This systemwas first used at Vercelli in 1984 for field measurements and allowsnear-simultaneous measurement of the rates of CH/sub 4/ emission in 16test plots. By this means it has been possible for the first time toconduct a comparative study of the rates of CH/sub 4/ emission from rice-fieldsfertilized in different degrees and from non-fertilized rice-fields.It must be assumed that the estimate in this report of 100 Tg of CH/sub4/ emitted globally per year from rice-fields is too law in so far asrice-fields in the main rice-growing areas in Asia (for instance China),unlike Italy, are very frequently fertilized with organic manure, resulting,as the present work indicates, in an increase in CH/sub 4/ emissions.</TEXT></DOC>
