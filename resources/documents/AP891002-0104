The justices, without comment, refused to take up an antitrustcontroversy stemming from the once-planned acquisition by Thomas J.Lipton Inc. of Kraft's Celestial Seasonings Inc.   The case dates back to 1987, when Lipton, a subsidiary of thehuge grocery products distributor Unilever, announced it had agreedto buy Celestial Seasonings from Kraft Inc.   Celestial is the largest U.S. producer of herbal teas,accounting for 52 percent of all sales.   Lipton controls the second largest herbal tea market share, 32percent.   Herbal teas are not actually teas but blends of flowers, leaves,roots and stems of edible plants. The blends are steeped in water,yielding a natural, caffeine-free beverage.   After it became clear the Federal Trade Commission was not goingto challenge the purchase, competitor R.C. Bigelow Inc. sued infederal court to stop it.   Bigelow, a family-owned business based in Norwalk, Conn.,accounts for about 13 percent of the herbal tea market's sales.   Its lawsuit contended that the merger of Lipton and Celestialwould create a monopoly that would hurt Bigelow's chances ofcompeting effectively in selling herbal teas.   U.S. District Judge Jose Cabranes in New Haven, Conn., threw outthe suit, ruling that Bigelow had not proved the merger wouldresult in predatory pricing or any other antitrust law violation.   ``The mere fact that Lipton will possess monopoly power afterthe proposed acquisition is not a sufficient showing that Liptonwill exercise that power in a way that will cause injury toBigelow,'' the judge said.   His ruling relied heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court decision thatmade it more difficult for companies to challenge successfullymergers of their competitors.   In that decision, the justices said a business making such achallenge ``must show a threat of antitrust injury'' and that ``ashowing of loss or damage due merely to increased competition doesnot constitute such injury.''   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Jan. 17 reinstatedthe suit.   It said the fact that Lipton would have an 84 percent share ofthe herbal tea market after purchasing Celestial ``constitutessufficient evidence, in and of itself, of antitrust injury to acompetitor to create a genuine issue for trial.''   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Lipton and Kraft saidthe 2nd Circuit court's ruling conflicts with the 1986 SupremeCourt decision.   What practical impact the case, sent back to Judge Cabranes bythe appeals court, continues to pack for the herbal tea market isbeing debated.   Kraft in September 1988 cancelled the proposed sale and enteredinto an agreement with Vestar Capital Partners Inc., a firmspecializing in leveraged buyouts, for a management-led buyout ofCelestial.   Bigelow argued before the 2nd Circuit court that the Septembersale did not make the case moot because the Lipton-Celestialtransaction has not been irrevocably abandoned.   Bigelow ``takes the position that there is more than a mere orabstract possibility that Lipton will again seek to acquireCelestial,'' the appeals court said. ``We agree.''   The case is Lipton vs. Bigelow, 88-1948.</TEXT></DOC>
