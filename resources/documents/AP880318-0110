North gavean employee of Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot a letter grantinghim presidential authority to take $100,000 into Canada as part ofa failed plan to free a U.S. hostage, a published report says.   The money, provided by Perot, wound up being squandered on highliving by a Canadian who was supposed to help win the release ofPeter C. Kilburn, the librarian at the American University inBeirut who was kidnapped Dec. 3, 1984, The Washington Post reportedtoday.   Kilburn was killed by a Libyan terrorist group in April 1986 inapparent retaliation for the U.S. bombing of Libya.   North sent Perot employee Jay Coburn to Canada in January 1986with a letter on National Security Council stationery that saidCoburn ``is acting on official U.S. Government business on behalfof the President of the United States,'' according to a copy of theletter obtained by the Post.   ``In support of this mission he has the authority to transportand disburse as necessary, U.S. $100,000,'' the letter said. ``Inthe event of emergency or clarification, please contact: Oliver L.North.''   Perot had provided the money at North's request, and Coburnneeded the North letter in case U.S. Customs Service agents stoppedhim at the border, the Post said.   Perot said Thursday night that he never questioned his employeeconcerning details of the cash delivery and didn't learn until muchlater the name of the hostage for whom authorities were negotiating.   He told the Dallas Times Herald the request for the money camefrom the NSC, but that he didn't seek to know details.   ``This is a small event in a very active life,'' he said. ``Theyasked me for it. I delivered it to them and I didn't ask for anydetails. They've been calling me on things like this since 1969. Itdoesn't matter to me who's president. I did it for a simple reason_ there was an American over there who needed help.''   Travelers must file a disclosure statement if they take morethan $10,000 out of the country. Failure to file is punishable byup to $250,000 in fines and five years in prison.   Coburn got into Canada without difficulty and in Montreal, hegave the money to a Canadian citizen who had provided proof ofcontact with Kilburn's captors.   The Canadian said the $100,000 was a down payment and that withit, he could arrange Kilburn's release for $1 million more, saidthe Post, which did not identify the man.   The Canadian contact took the money, but never came through withhis end of the deal and was later observed by the CIA in Damascus,spending the money on high living, the Post said, citingunidentified sources for the information.   The Post said that a senior FBI official has told Congress thatthen-FBI Director William H. Webster _ who is now CIA director _approved the FBI's participation in the plan. The newspaper saidthe plan also was discussed with Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   North has said repeatedly that he had express authority from hissuperiors for his actions. But the White House has said Reagan hadno knowledge of any efforts to ransom U.S. hostages in Lebanon.   North, who was fired from his job as an NSC aide in late 1986following revelations of the secret sales of arms to Iran and thediversion of profits from those sales to the Nicaraguan Contrarebels, was indicted Wednesday.   He was charged with conspiracy to defraud the government andcommit criminal offenses against it, theft of government propertyand wire fraud arising from the diversion of arms-sales proceeds.   He was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction ofCongress, making false statements, obstructing Meese's Nov. 21-23,1986, inquiry by making false statements and concealing, falsifyingand destroying classified government documents in NSC files.   Also indicted Wednesday were former national security adviserJohn M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and AlbertHakim.</TEXT></DOC>
