London stocks closed mixed after a day of trading that lacked direction.    At Tokyo, the key Nikkei index shed more than 300 points at its worst levels midway in the afternoon session before recovering slightly toward the close.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues closed with a loss of 215.99 points at 34471.66. The index gained 80.24 points Tuesday, the first gain in six days.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 28.24 points to 34499.90.    Wednesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 500 million shares, down from 561 million Tuesday.    Declining issues widely outnumbered gainers, 646 to 288, while 166 issues remained unchanged.    Traders said a series of downward revisions of blue-chip firms' earnings coming from newspapers and securities firms deprived the market of what little momentum it had Tuesday.    An official at Wako Securities said investors appear to be rethinking the blue chips. Early this month the market went through a phase in which blue chips were snapped up almost indiscriminately, he said, but now investors are dividing them into two &quot;poles . . .good and bad stocks,&quot; according to the Wako official.    A few of the stocks still on the &quot;good pole&quot; managed to keep the Nikkei index from falling further, he said, but as a whole investors were put off by reports in recent days of downward revisions in the earnings forecasts of such companies as Honda, Kyocera andMatsushita.    Still on the good pole are Sony, Pioneer and Fanuc, while the down pole includes TDK, Matsushita, Kyocera and Honda, he said.    Speculation of further bank mergers and acquisitions pushed up Takushoku Bank and Kyowa Bank, among others. Midsized and regional banks seen to be possible candidates for mergers attracted investor attention. In many cases, however, the speculation wasn't backed by any reliable information, traders noted. Isetan and Daiei received investor attention because of a rumor that they may be the next target of a merger and acquisition attempt.    Small-lot sell orders pushed down prices in a broad range, including housings, constructions, electric powers and autos.    The issues that had been bought earlier this month for their bright earnings prospects were generally lower Wednesday. Fuji Photo was down 70 yen (48 cents) at 4,580 yen ($32.03). Kyocera lost 50 to 5,670 and Honda fell 20 to 1,920.    Instead, investors headed for Taiyo Kobe Bank and Mitsui Bank following the announcement of their intention to merge next April to become the world's second largest bank in total assets.    The bid for both banks far outpaced offers from the start of trading, and neither share opened until late in the afternoon session. Mitsui Bank closed at 2,580, up 230. Taiyo Kobe was up 300 to end the day at 1,930. Trading of the two issues was suspended Tuesday.    In London, a shortage of significant corporate or economic news deprived the market of any real incentive to adopt a clear direction. The market opened lower after Wall Street's retreat Tuesday, inched higher to stand practically unchanged around midday, and then hovered.    The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index closed 0.5 points firmer at 2381.3 points, and up from an intraday low of 2373.3. At its highest, the index touched 2383.7, a rise of 2.9 points.    Dealers said the U.K. stock market was unimpressed by a robust showing on Wall Street during the London afternoon. &quot;We are treating further gains on Wall Street with caution,&quot; one trader said.    Some traders attributed the market's lackluster tone to wariness ahead of the final-quarter company earnings reporting season due to start next week, which may confirm fears of an impending fall in U.K. corporate profitability.    &quot;This market has rallied on technical factors such as the weight of money and shortage of stock, so no one likes the thought of the fundamentals reasserting themselves,&quot; one trader said.    The narrower Financial Times 30-share index ended down 1.8 points at 1970.9. Turnover by the close registered a mediocre 414 million shares, up from a below-average 383.1 million Tuesday.    Most buying interest focused on a handful of stocks that have recently attracted takeover speculation.    Among these, Midland Bank progressed 6 pence (9.5 cents) to 370 pence ($5.87) as takeover speculation revived on what Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. intends to do with its stake in the U.K. clearing bank. Asda climbed 5 1/2 pence to 205 as takeover rumors once again resurfaced on the stock. Speculation focused on the intentions of the Belzberg brothers of Canada, who hold around a 5% stake in the U.K. supermarket chain. Storehouse, which rose 10 on Tuesday on rumors that U.K. publisher Robert Maxwell has sold part of his stake in the company, eased 4 to 144. According to news reports yesterday, the buyer of the stake is believed to be a U.S. concern.    Lonrho edged 6 higher to 309 on talk that Alan Bond had sold his 20% stake in the U.K. company to a Japanese buyer for 312 pence a share. &quot;It sounds like a bit of a tall story to me,&quot; one trader said.    Scottish andamp; Newcastle eased 4 to 374 as the stock continued to retreat on a downgrading issued earlier this week by U.K. brokerage James Capel andamp; Co.    Rolls-Royce jumped 6 to 191 1/2, in reaction to recent weakness. Dealers said the stock is attracting interest ahead of Sept. 16, when its holders are expected to pass a plan boosting the limit on foreign shareholdings in Rolls to 29.9% from 15%. Wellcome ended 17 higher at 710 in a corrective action after its 20-pence fall Tuesday. &quot;There was renewed speculation that its AIDS-fighting drug Retrovir is a real winner,&quot; one dealer said.    Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris; lower in Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan and mixed in Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed higher.    Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul and Wellington, were lower in Taipei and Manila, and little changed in Sydney.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end. @ % This @ Aug 29 Aug 28 Year @ U.S. ................. 321.7 323.9 + 25.6 @ Britain .............. 714.9 719.3 + 30.9 @ Canada ............... 434.3 431.6 + 18.3 @ Japan ................ 1540.1 1538.6 + 8.4 @ France ............... 535.9 536.2 + 21.1 @ Germany .............. 251.5 252.4 + 21.0 @ Hong Kong ............ 1849.0 1873.6 - 8.9 @ Switzerland .......... 238.0 239.9 + 37.7 @ Australia ............ 357.0 354.5 + 23.0 @ World index .......... 537.2 536.4 + 8.6 </TEXT></DOC>
