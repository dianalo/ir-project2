 We have been particularly puzzled by the high cost ofdesign systems.andP;  How does a creative designer cost-justify a six-figuresystem, when most of his time is spent dreaming up new ideas?andP;  Indeed, mostindividual designers are scarcely able to consider the financial commitmentneeded to install a high-end system; many even balk at buying a Macintosh.andO;Investing in a high-priced workstation is a considerable break with pasttradition of capital investments on the order of drawing markers and Letrasetpress-on lettering sheets.andM;Recently we had the opportunity to visit the company that started the designsystem market and that today has the largest installed base of suchsystems--Aesthedes.andP;  Like many companies in the prepress business, Aesthedeswas founded by an end user--in this case, Dominique Claessens--who saw a needfor a system that was not available on the market and decided to build onethat would do the job.andP;  His company, Claesens Product Consultants, is a largeindustrial design group that currently employs about 60 designers.andM;Twenty years ago, Claessens decided to build a system that would assistdesigners in converting their ideas from sketches into presentation visualsand eventually into finished artwork.andP;  Finding nothing commerciallyavailable, Claessens built his own system, which was based on videotechnology.andM;The original system used multiple video cameras feeding a central controldesk and color video monitor.andP;  Multiple images could be recorded andindividually manipulated and then merged on the screen to create a completeimage.andP;  The resulting image was then output as a color transparency to aClaessens-developed fil recorder.andP;  (This was in the days before the Dunncamera.)andM;The benefit of the video system was its real-time response.andP;  A designer didnot have to wait for postprocessing; everything happened as you did it.andP;  Thesystem is still in use at Claessens Design Studio in Hilversum, Holland, andit is an intriguing device to see demonstrated.andM;From the original system, Claessens and his team learned that in order toproduce high-quality artwork, and to facilitate illustrations as well aspictures, what they needed was a vector-based system that still had excellentresponse times.andP;  The first digital system was developed using Motorola 68000processors.andP;  Over time, this system evolved into Aesthedes 1, which waslaunched in 1985, when Claessens set up Aesthedes as a wholly ownedsubsidiary.andM;Aesthedes today employs 150 people, including 35 in research and development.andO;Its headquarters are in Geel, Belgium, with other operations in Hilversum,Holland.andP;  It has a sales presence, through either a direct office or anagent, in Belgium, Holland, UK, Germany, France, Scandinavia, Italy, Spain,Switzerland, Japan and the U.S.andM;The original system.andP;  The Aesthedes 1 frequency evokes gasps of surprise atfirst encounter.andP;  Physically, it is quite large--a massive desk withmultiple-key touch pads strategically placed around a digitizing tablet onits surface.andP;  Over the desk look six monitors--three large Barco colorscreens and three small ASCII monitors.andP;  If anything, it looks more like acontrol desk for NASA than a product for a designer, and indeed, walking intothe training department of Aesthedes feels like entering mission control atCape Canaveral.andM;Despite its intimidating appearance, the Aesthedes 1 system has proved to bea very fast and effective tool for producing the visuals that a designerconceives.andP;  Although it could be used for free-form creation, typically it isused by artists who specialize in rendering designs, and as such, theAesthedes can be thought of as a design production tool, one that is used torender and produce art according to the design.andM;Among the more than 200 customers Aesthedes has worldwide are Volvo andElectrolux in Sweden, Tetrapak and Bowater Containers in the UK, R.J.andO;Reynolds in the U.S., Daimler Benz and Europa Carton in Germany and ShinkoPrinting Industries in Japan.andM;Typically, an Aesthedes system is used in one of two primary areas: packagingand industrial design.andP;  The former involves rendering designs in a variety offorms for different packaging needs--for example, taking a beer label andmodifying it for use on boxes, promotional materials, point-of-sale displaysand so forth.andP;  Many of Aesthedes' customers are in the packaging industry,and they bought the system because of the speed with which it producesdifferent renderings of designs for different packages and the quality of artthat it is capable of producing.andM;In industrial design, the system extracts vector-based engineering data (suchas the CAD information for a Mercedes car) and uses it as the basis for anartistic rendering that may be modified in innumerable ways to explore theeffects of different design decisions, such as the color of the interior orthe shape of the seats.andM;New productsandM;Aesthedes has done well in its home territory with a specialized componentfor design production.andP;  Its new products are a step toward providing morecomplete systems that broaden the company's target market.andM;The first new product is the Aesthedes 2, its second-generation system, whichreplaces all of the 68000 processors (from eight to more than a dozendepending on the system) with 68030 processors, boosting speed andcapability.andP;  With the new hardware is a new software release as well.andP;  Inaddition, Aesthedes has developed a smaller, add-on workstation for theEuropean market and a new standalone system for the U.S.; it has signed anagreement with Superset by which it will offer high-resolution retouching;and it is introducing an upgrade to its file manager/peripheral driver thathas an impressive list of interfaces as well as its own RIP.andM;Moving up.andP;  The Aesthedes 2 is a hardware upgrade for the original Aesthedessystem, retaining the six-monitor design and much of the same software.andO;Underneath, however, it replaces the 68000 processors with 68020 and 68030processors, and it adds a more extensive keyboard.andP;  Memory and disk capacityhave been expanded as well.andP;  Thus, it will offer the same functions as anolder Aesthedes but with much better speed.andM;Among the 30 or so new software features are a few key additions:andM;* Pantone's colors, now supported as a color model;andM;* Barcode generation;andM;* Mirroring of selected elements to create custom patterns;andM;* Wrapping images around a defined shape.andP;  This function is used to wrap animage around the shape of its planned package, such as a box or cylinder.andM;Text has been enhanced, too.andP;  Previously, Aesthedes described all type asheadlines, which were keyed directly on the system, displayed as vectors onthe screen and rasterized for output.andP;  Now it has added a body copycapability.andP;  This supports remote entry of text on a PC (imported as rawASCII).andP;  The body text is rasterized on the fly for the screen display, whereit cannot be edited (but it can still be edited in the source file.)andM;Body copy may be manually kerned, wrapped to irregular shapes and flowedwithin layout areas.andP;  A basic handamp;j program based on dictionary hyphenation hasbeen added.andM;URW font outlines are used for both headlines and body copy, but the bodycopy outlines include hints for better rendering of type at low resolution.andO;Ten fonts are usually bundled, but more than 1,00 URW faces are available.andM;Typically, text is merged with graphics at the time of output by theAesthedes Peripheral Driver, which rerasterizes the type for the appropriateoutput device and resolution.andM;The Aesthedes 2 has been in beta testing in Europe for about five months andis now being released as a commercial product, with new orders scheduled toship within 60 days.andP;  The price of the Aesthedes 2 is the same as that of thecurrent product: $230,000 or about 400,000 Dutch guilders.andP;  All existingAesthedes 1 systems can be field upgraded to level 2 machines for about$75,000.andM;Moving down.andP;  Even companies that make a living rendering package designs mayfind the price tag of additional Aesthedes seats prohibitive.andP;  To addressthat need, Aesthedes has developed the Design Team, a new single-monitorstation, also based on 68020 and 68030 processors, that plugs into theAestedes 2.andM;The Design Team will be sold as an add-on to the Aesthedes 2 system in Europeand other markets outside of the U.S.andP;  Utilizing the disk of the Aesthedes 2,the Design Team has much of the same functionality as the larger system(without support for vignettes or scanned images), but it will run slower andnot offer the specialized hardware.andP;  For example, it has a much smallerkeyboard; it uses a mouse instead of a digitizing tablet; and it uses justone large monitor rather than three.andP;  (The monitor may be monochrome orcolor.)andM;The Design Team is envisioned as a support workstation for generating lineart and geometry files that may be passed to the larger workstation.andM;The Design Team will be sold in several configurations, beginning at aboutone-sixth the price of the Aesthedes 2, or about 70,000 guilders, up to about130,000 guilders.andP;  Up to 10 Design Team workstations may be connected to anAesthedes 2, although four adds-ons might be a more reasonable number toretain decent performance.andP;  Aesthedes 1 users must upgrade to the Aesthedes 2to use a Design Team workstation.andM;First American product.andP;  The American market has been slower to adopthigh-priced, specialized art/design production systems than Europe.andP;  Thereare many possible reasons: many customers are confused about the differencesbetween an Aesthedes and a Lightspeed; many companies prefer to constraincapital expenditures rather than labor costs; and few designers are skilledcomputer operators, to name just three.andM;With only a small American presence, Aesthedes has done well against itsprimary competitor, Contex, and it now claims an American installed base ofabout 30 systems valued at over $9 million.andP;  But it has faced increasingpressure to offer a system that had less of a European feel.andM;Sensing the need for a smaller system that breaks the $100,000 price barrierand is more in sync with American products, Aesthedes has begun buildingstandalone systems in its U.S.andP;  headquarters in Torrance, California.andM;The new U.S.andP;  product, code-named Prisma, will be introduced at the PrattDesign Conference in New York, June 12-14.andP;  (Claessens expected at press timethat the name will be changed for legal reasons.)andM;The U.S.andP;  product has all of the functionality of an Aesthedes 2 packed intoa single cabinet, with one color monitor and one ASCII monitor.andP;  It reflectsthe current U.S.andP;  demand for an &quot;all-in-1&quot; product that offers a singleoperator all of the high-end functionality for under $100,000 but trades offperformance.andP;  (The European models are designed to make each operator asefficient as possible, which places performance in front of funtionality andprice.)andM;The U.S.andP;  system is housed in a 19&quot;-wide cabinet that fits under the desk; ontop of the desk a single color monitor and one ASCII monitor are used inconjunction with a tabletop keyboard with soft keys and digitizing pad, muchlike that of the Aesthedes 2, and a standard input keyboard.andP;  Versatec andmagnetic tape output drivers are included.andM;The software of the U.S.andP;  system is identical to that of an Aesthedes 2.andP;  Thetradeoffs are in a smaller keyboard, the lack of additional monitors andspeed.andP;  On the single-terminal system, the three color and three ASCIImonitors are treated as virtual screens.andP;  You can see one of each at a timeand can switch at will between views.andP;  (The three views are the compositeimage, the present vector layer and the zoom of the present layer.)andP;  Eachview is held in a memory buffer so there is no delay when switching betweenviews.andM;The basic standalone system is priced at about $100,000.andP;  It includesinterfaces for directly connecting up to four diskless stations (much likethe Design Teams), each of which is priced at about $60,000.andP;  However, thebasic system will not allow background output of high-resolution files; amore advanced version that does have dedicated processors for generatinghigh-res output is priced at about $150,000.andM;Other options, such as storage (300 MB are standard; it may be upgraded to 1gibabyte) and additional output drivers, are available.andP;  Aesthedes announcedthat it intends to fill orders within 60 to 90 days.andM;Moving out--to retouch.andP;  Until now, Aesthedes has been limited in its rasterimage handling by its video-resolution frame buffers.andP;  As part of its moveinto more complete systems, Aesthedes has reached an agreement with Supersetby which Aesthedes will act as Superset's exclusive European distributor andwill rely on Superset as an OEM in the U.S.andP;  In Europe, Aesthedes will sellSuperset under the Superset label.andP;  Officially, Aesthedes will sellSuperset's ReVision image retouching system under its own label, theAesthedes CT2, in the U.S.andP;  Unofficially, Aesthedes is openly acknowledgingits arrangement.andM;European acceptance of the product has been enthusiastic.andP;  Six systems havebeen sold in the three months since the signing of the agreement.andM;Superset's retouching system works in real time on high-resolution files froma color scanner.andP;  Currently it interfaces directly to the Howtek and throughmag tape to Scitex and Hell and Crosfield for continuous-tone (CT) files.andO;The Dainippon Screen interface is pending the completion of the DDESstandard.andM;Aesthedes has developed a two-way interface between the Superset and theAesthedes Peripheral Driver, which provides 35 different interfaces.andM;For its part, Superset has just released a new version of its software, whichwe recently reported (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  12).andM;The pricing of the CT2 reflects the differences between Europe and theStates.andP;  In the U.S., the base price of $145,000 does not include anyoptions, including peripheral drivers.andP;  European pricing, which is under400,000 Dutch guilders, includes additional options in differentconfigurations.andM;Moving into print.andP;  Aesthedes has done a great deal of work to make itsprinter drivers match colors as closely as the output device will allow.andP;  TheClaessens showroom in Hilversum is a good example.andP;  A sampling of packagelabels for a large Dutch brewery output on Versatec plotters, the Irisink-jet printer and printed conventionally showed remarkable resemblance--somuch so that it was difficult at first glance to tell the difference.andO;Aesthedes said that under tight deadlines to produce promotional art, itsometimes substitutes the thermal or plain-paper proofs for printer piecesthat aren't back from the printer.andP;  Few companies have taken the time tomatch colors well enough to make such a substitution.andM;A new RIP.andP;  A new development on the output front is the release of theAesthedes Peripheral Driver 2 (APD2), a file manager and high-performance RIPthat handles I/O from a range of systems, as well as merging raster art fromthe Superset and vector art from the Aesthedes.andP;  We first saw the advancedperipheral driver last fall at IPEX, where it was merging text and art foroutput (Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  3, pp.andP;  5-6).andP;  As with the earliest version, the newAPD2 also converts data, such as Illustrator and other Mac image files intoAesthedes vector format, or Aesthedes art into Scitex, Hell or Crosfieldformats and vice versa, among others.andP;  Output drivers include Ohio Engravinggravure cylinder engraving machines, Itek and Purup drum recorders, and awide range of plotters, thermal transfer printers, ink-jet printers, colorslide recorders, and packaging plotter cutters.andP;  An indication of Aesthedes'intention to become a full system supplier is the availability of the L 3000Laser Film Recorder, which is the Ultre recorder driven directly from theAPD2.andM;How is it cost-justified?andM;How do customers cost-justified the cost of such a system? According toClaessens, the last thing a good designer should do is sit at a computer.andO;The designer's best tools are his head and hands, which produce sketchesfaster and freer than computer drawing systems.andP;  Where Aesthedes comes in isin the rendering of the drawing.andP;  A skilled Aesthedes operator (funtioninglike a prepress operator) can convert the sketches into a range of visualsmuch more quickly than designers could render all of the comps and finishedart themselves.andP;  The designer becomes more productive (because he is notbogged down in rendering), and the company becomes more productive bygenerating visuals for the client more quickly, more economically (becausethe labor time is greatly reduced and there is less time spent producingfinal art on a prepress system) and in more variations than would have beenpossible previously.andM;Will there still be a need for the proprietary Aesthedes systems, given thenew workstations coming to market?andP;  Claessens believes that, at least in thenear future, the design of the Aesthedes system, which is optimized forworking on three different levels simultaneously, will provide betterperformance than off-the-shelf workstations.andM;In Europe, his experience is that companies find it more cost-effective toretain designers by freeing them with tools such as an Aesthedes thatstreamline the design production process.andP;  He has found the American marketto be less concerned about productivity of individual workers and moreconcerned about capital expenditures.andP;  Hence, the development of a smalleststandalone system for the American market.andM;In some respects, Aesthedes seems to be bucking the mainstream of thepublishing industry, but, like many other industry leaders, Claessens baseshis plans on a very detailed knowledge of his client base.andP;  Until now, thathas paid off well, as Aesthedes has grown to include a sizable customer basefrom which it is profitable.andP;  Much of that base is outside the U.S.andP;  Now,with a new product designed specifically for the American market, it hopes tofurther its success here as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
