Despite the severed relations between the nations since the 1980 hostage crisis, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled that the Iranian company can proceed with its lawsuit, filed here in 1986, against several shipping lines.    In 1987, U.S. District Judge Richard Owen had dismissed the case, largely because the American government doesn't recognize the government of Ayatollah Khomeini. In its opinion reversing Judge Owen, the appeals court wrote, &quot;The absence of formal recognition does not necessarily result in a foreign government being barred from access to U.S. courts.&quot;    What may have made a difference in the appeal was a brief submitted by the U.S. Justice Department and the State Department expressing the executive branch's belief that Iran should have access to U.S. courts. The Justice Department filed similar briefs this year in two pending civil cases in which the Iranian government is a plaintiff.    Among the U.S. government's arguments was that the executive branch has substantially discontinued the practice of formal recognitions of foreign governments. Therefore, access to the courts shouldn't necessarily be linked to formal recognition as it traditionally has been.    In its opinion, the appeals court said, &quot;It is evident that in today's topsy-turvy world, governments can topple and relationships can change in a moment.&quot; In concluding, the court said, &quot;a break in diplomatic relations with another government does not automatically signify denial of access to federal courts.&quot;    A State Department official who asked not to be identified said that the department's involvement in the case doesn't represent &quot;any policy change toward the Iranian government, but strictly dealt with legal matters.&quot; But some lawyers who specialize in international law disagree. Given the facts of the case &quot;there had to be a fairly political intent,&quot; said Lawrence Newman, a partner at the law firm Baker andamp; McKenzie.    The case concerns the legal efforts of National Petrochemical Co., which is owned by the Iranian government, to recoup losses from a 1980 scheme to obtain chemicals from the U.S. In early 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued an executive order barring sales of American products to Iran. As a result, National Petrochemical agreed to buy the products from an Arab company which in turn was purchasing them from a West German firm. The firm, Hamburg-based Rotexchemie Brunst andamp; Co. had a Geneva affiliate that had contracts with U.S. sellers. The Iranian government alleges in its suit that Rotexchemie concealed the origin of the cargo and its destination by fabricating shipping documents. Rotexchemie also chartered several shipping lines to transport the chemicals from Houston to Iran via Barcelona, Spain, according to the suit.    But the labyrinthine plan broke down in September 1980 when war broke out between Iran and Iraq. The suit alleges the chemicals were diverted to Taiwan where Rotexchemie sold them, and accuses the shippers, including one U.S. company, of participating in the scheme. </TEXT></DOC>
