Collister Johnson Jr., a senior vice president, blamed the loss on &quot;idle capacity.&quot; He said the company's fleet had to be rearranged to conform with Continental Airlines' Continental Jet Express service. In February, Presidential, crippled by slow growth and mounting operating losses, agreed to become a feeder carrier for Continental, a unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp.    Presidential said it expects to post revenue of about $20.6 million, which includes an extraordinary gain of $4.3 million from the sale of Presidential's terminal at Dulles Airport in Washington. In the year-earlier quarter, Presidential had revenue of $11.8 million.    Mr. Johnson said better fleet utilization, reduced operating expenses and higher profit margins should improve financial results in the second quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
