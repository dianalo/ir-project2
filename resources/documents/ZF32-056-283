ZachmannandM;SunSoft's announcement early this month of Solaris 2.0 for Intel 386 and 486PCs as well as for SPARC systems is good news for users -- whether or notthey ever use the product.andM;The decision to port Sun Microsystems' popular Unix-based system software tothe Intel 386/486 architecture raises the competitive standards for desktopoperating environments.andP;  It puts additional pressure on both IBM's OS/2 2.0and Microsoft's Windows NT strategies.andM;Sun has seized the opportunity created by the bickering between Microsoft andIBM.andP;  Regardless of its success in this effort, at least users now have astrong new alternative to &quot;either of the above.&quot;andM;Solaris 2.0 is really a bundle of a number of base products from SunSoft, aSun Mi-crosystems subsidiary.andP;  It includes the base SunOS 5.0 operatingsystem based on Unix System V release 4.0, the Open Network Computing (ONC)suite of distributed network-based services, the OpenWindows developmentenvironment, and the Open Look graphical user interface and DeskSet version 3applications.andM;This bundle provides capabilities that are highly competitive with anythingIBM or Microsoft have promised for OS/2 2.0 or Windows NT.andP;  Sun enthusiastsplausibly argue that Solaris 2.0 is considerably better than both in many, ifnot most, respects.andP;  Until now, Sun's system software has been available onlyon systems built around the RISC-based SPARC microprocessor designed by Sunand licensed to other vendors.andP;  But sales of SPARC systems by vendors otherthan Sun have been small; the vast majority of systems that run the Sunsoftware are made by Sun.andM;In one sense, Sun's announcementandM;that Solaris 2.0 will be available on Intel 386/486 systems acknowledges thefailure of Sun's SPARC-clone strategy.andM;Modest sales of SPARC systems by other vendors have hitherto left Solaris andSunOS as a semiproprietary environment exclusive to Sun hardware.andP;  Sun'sdecision to move the environment is partly intended to compensate for thefirm's inability to develop a broad, multivendor installed base of SPARCsystems.andM;On the other hand, Sun's move to port Solaris to Intel systems is also a boldand aggressive one.andM;Sun workstations have generated tremendous enthusiasm and loyalty in theirusers.andP;  Those accustomed to working on Sun workstations typically look withsomething between disdain and pity on their colleagues who use a product likeMicrosoft Windows on Intel-architecture systems.andP;  And they do so withconsiderable justification: Sun's excellent operating-system software is themajor reason.andP;  The port of Solaris 2.0 to Intel 386/486 systems, due bymid-1992, will make that software available to millions more desktops.andM;Of course, some factors will limit the success of Solaris.andP;  SunSoft's currentprice tag on Solaris is $1,395 for workstation systems and $795 for laptops.andO;That's much higher than Microsoft's and IBM's prices for Windows and OS/2.andO;SunSoft will need to lower its prices to compete.andP;  Further, resourcerequirements for Solaris on Intel 386/486 systems, though not yet announced,are likely to be substantial.andP;  Solaris will probably require a lot of memoryand disk space, thereby limiting its use to very high-end personal computersystems.andM;Finally, Solaris almost surely will lack the degree of upward compatibilityfor existing DOS or Windows applications that Microsoft and IBM have promisedfor Windows NT and OS/2 2.0.andP;  That, too, will lessen its appeal for manyorganizations and users.andM;Nevertheless, Solaris 2.0 will at least offer an attractive alternative,particularly in organizations that have a substantial number of high-endIntel 386/486 systems, major networking requirements, and an interest inexpanding beyond individual productivity to enterpisewide systems.andP;  Whetheror not Solaris 2.0 wins the race, Sun's entry will certainly stimulate IBMand Microsoft to quicken their own paces.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
