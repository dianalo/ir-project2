This handbookaddresses the procedural difficulties involved in the development ofcontractual relationships between private operators and public agencies.It focuses on transit programs (funded by UMTA) and practical how-to-do-itinformation about service contracting. The handbook is a valuable resourcefor private operators opting to improve the effectiveness of their contractingefforts with local governments. It is organized into seven chapters.Chapters 2, 3 and 4 provide background information on new market opportunities,funding programs, and the local transportation-planning process. Thesechapters are necessary for understanding how to effectively participatein public-transit programs.
