Struggles to Lure Back Customers </HL><AUTHOR> Carol Hymowitz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LTD </CO><IN> RET PRO </IN><TEXT>   Limited Inc. is having limited success wooing customers back to its specialty women's apparel stores.    Long the retail trendsetter, the Columbus, Ohio-based giant is fighting consumer boredom for its trendy sportswear. It's working feverishly to attract the &quot;30-something&quot; woman, who now makes up the largest group of U.S. shoppers, by filling racks with career and classic-style clothes. The company has also opened a score of sleekly designed, larger-sized &quot;superstores&quot; to offer a broader mix of merchandise.    On the surface, the moves appear to be paying off. September sales rose 11% from a year earlier, a larger increase than many competitors achieved.    But perhaps more telling was the poor showing by the company's Limited division. That unit, which accounts for about 28% of total sales, had about a 10% drop in same-store sales. And even such strong-performing divisions as Limited Express, which caters to young women, had to rely on promotions.    Analysts and industry consultants contend that Limited, like others in the industry, will have to work harder to stand out. While its old formula of spotting hot fashion items, mass manufacturing them overseas and distributing them quickly to a network of stores worked through the early 1980s, it can no longer generate meteoric growth.    &quot;In the past, Limited could grow simply by opening more and more stores,&quot; says Kathryn Ellis, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. But with mall development slowed to a crawl, &quot;those days are over -- and Limited has had problems giving its customer the right quality, price and styles,&quot; she adds.    Indeed Limited could falter if there is an economic downturn later this year -- or simply if it fails to overhaul its cookie-cutter approach to merchandise, others agree. &quot;Their biggest challenge is filling their thousands of stores with unique clothing,&quot; says Margo McGlade, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. Limited currently operates 3,292 stores, and plans to add another 119 outlets by year end.    &quot;When you're a teen-ager, you want to look like everyone else, but the older customer -- the one they need to reach -- wants to make a personal statement with fashion -- and not bump into five other women at a business meeting who are wearing the same suit,&quot; Ms. McGlade says.    Limited officials contend they haven't lost their talent for spotting hot fashion trends, and also are benefiting from a fallout among competitors. &quot;We're seeing a thinning of the herd, with many smaller specialty retailers going out of business and department stores in disarray&quot; following a wave of takeovers, Limited's founder and chairman, Leslie H. Wexner, told stockholders at the company's annual meeting in May. &quot;That means greater opportunity for us -- and we have the potential to double and triple the size of our business in the early 1990s.&quot;    In fact, while Limited has been battered during this year's severe fashion retailing slump, it has outperformed many competitors. Unlike Charming Shoppes Inc. or U.S. Shoe Corp.'s Casual Corner stores, for example -- which got stuck with stockrooms of casual sportswear just as its popularity was dying -- Limited maintained tight inventory levels, enabling it to control markdowns.    Limited's shares -- which closed yesterday at $23.50, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading -- languish far from the lofty high of $52.875 that they hit before the Oct. 19 stock market crash last year. The drop has hurt many of Limited's managers owning shares, especially Mr. Wexner, the chairman, who has had paper losses of more than $1 billion since then.    Although Limited had a poor first half, analysts expect profits to improve in the third and fourth quarters. Many estimate that per-share earnings for all of the fiscal year ending Jan. 31 will be $1.15 to $1.20, down from $1.25 a year earlier.    They point to some divisions that have succeeded in establishing a devoted customer base. Victoria's Secret, for example, has won fans with its wide selection of lingerie, and now is branching out further with bedroom and bathroom furnishings. And the Lerner division has carved a niche with the low-to-middle-income shopper who craves inexpensive fashion.    But the pivotal Limited division is still struggling to create a fresh fashion style. So far, its new assortment of suits, dressy shirts and classic-style dresses hasn't snared the older, more affluent shopper. And this new selection may be turning off Limited's traditional young, price-conscious customer.    At the Limited's new downtown Pittsburgh store, a cluster of young secretaries turn away from a rack of dressy rayon shirts, concluding that even the marked down price of $29 is too steep. But a lawyer in her 30's also rejects the shirts, complaining that &quot;the fabric is too cheap, and they don't fit well.&quot;    Lyndsey Phillips, a 29-year-old Columbus sales manager, similarly complains that &quot;quality is poor for the price. I'll pay $80 to $110 for a jacket, but not one that is skimpy or has a weak collar and cheap pockets. I want one that will last for years.&quot;    Limited's executive vice president and chief financial officer Kenneth Gilman acknowledges that &quot;the sourcing base for career wear is new for us, and we're continuing to make improvements.&quot; But he maintains, &quot;we offer very good quality at a good price.&quot;    A few specialty retailers -- such as Gap Inc., whose Gap stores last month posted about 12% same-store sales gains -- may be beating Limited at that game, however. Ms. Phillips shopped almost exclusively at the Gap this fall: &quot;They've got knit skirts, 100% cotton shirts and interesting cardigan sets for $44 in great colors -- and they'll last.&quot;    Limited officials scoff at critics who charge that its different chains are battling for the same customers with copycat fashions, with top executives so competitive they won't share marketing strategies. &quot;If Limited and Limited Express offer the same item, that's fine as long as it's the best item,&quot; says Mr. Gilman.    And now the company is banking on a &quot;bigger stores are better&quot; growth philosophy. In larger stores, they maintain, they'll achieve higher sales per square foot, by selling higher priced fashions and new product lines like children's wear.    That will require far more designing inventiveness and sourcing savvy, consultants say. Retailers like the Gap have hired top-name designers to knock off exclusive labels. Gap Inc.'s Banana Republic, for example, is planning this spring to sell a skirt for about $60 that's a copy of a $400 Ralph Lauren original.    &quot;Five years ago, Limited could go to the south of France, spot a cable cotton knit sweater, bring it back and sell five million -- but now they'd be trampled on the French docks by 10 other retailers,&quot; says Carol Farmer, a New York marketing consultant. </TEXT></DOC>
