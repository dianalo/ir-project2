John Dingell,D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce investigationssubcommittee, said today on NBC's ``Today'' show, also charging thatthe FDA ``has not done its job as it should have.''   ``Questions now exist as to whether or not these drugs arebioequivalent,'' said Dingell. ``And unfortunately, we're now in theposition where we can't say they're safe. The process has to beredone and we have to find out just what is going on here.''   Dingell and Thomas Bliley, R-Va., the panel's ranking Republican,said in a letter to U.S. District Judge John R.

Bill McCollum of Florida, charged in anarticle published Sunday in the editorial section of the WashingtonPost.   The most recent blunder, he wrote, was to shut off the supply ofU.S. arms while pressuring Afghan guerrillas into launching anassault on the Afghan city of Jalalabad near the Pakistani border.   At the same time, the Soviet Union continued massive armssupplies to its client in Kabul, enabling that government towithstand the assault.   The siege of Jalalabad has turned into a stalemate that threatensto stall the entire resistance movement.   The key mistake by the Central Intelligence Agency and the StateDepartment was to give control U.S. arms shipments to the guerrillasto Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence, that nation's equivalentof the CIA, McCollum wrote.   ``Why the CIA gave ISI its proxy was easier to understand in thebeginning,'' as the United States began to arm the Moslemguerrillas, or mujahedeen, after the 1979 Soviet invasion, McCollumwrote.</TEXT></DOC>
