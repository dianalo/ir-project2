Gottschalk Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SKBSTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against three former accounting executives of SmithKline Beckman Corp.'s Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc. unit in Irvine, Calif., and two others, charging that they were involved in an insider trading scheme.    The SEC charged that the three former accounting executives learned of SmithKline's proposed acquisition of International Hydron Corp., a maker of soft contact lenses, and bought International Hydron stock on Sept. 12, 1984 -- the day before the public announcement. The complaint, filed in federal district court here, alleges that two of the three illegally told two others, who also bought shares.    Four of the five signed a consent decree with the SEC enjoining them from future securities violations -- without admitting or denying the allegations -- and three agreed to give up their profits from the trading. An attorney for Allergan said the company had no comment on the complaint.    The complaint alleged that William Adams, former director of corporate accounting for Allergan; James Tortorice, former manager of accounting services; and James Fischer, former manager of domestic financial accounting, learned of the acquisition proposal before the public announcement and illegally made purchases of International Hydron stock. The complaint also said that Mr. Adams tipped off his brother-in-law, Howard Jacobs, of Anaheim Hills, Calif., who also bought International Hydron stock. In addition, the complaint said Mr. Tortorice improperly told his attorney, David Serrano, of Dana Point, Calif., who bought International Hydron shares.    The five plaintiffs couldn't be reached for comment. A spokesman for Philadelphia-based SmithKline said the company couldn't comment because it hadn't seen the complaint.    The SEC claims that Mr. Serrano realized an illegal profit of at least $9,919, Mr. Tortorice made $2,251 and Mr. Jacobs realized $13,485. The agency added that Mr. Serrano consented to pay a penalty of $19,838 pursuant to the Insider Trading Sanctions Act.    Messrs. Serrano, Tortorice, Jacobs and Fischer consented to the final order of a permanent injunction enjoining them from future violations of securities laws.    The SEC said litigation continues against Mr. Adams.    The SEC said market surveillance by the American Stock Exchange led to the filing of the complaint. On Oct. 18, 1984, SmithKline Beckman's agreement in principle to buy International Hydron from National Patent Development Corp. was terminated. </TEXT></DOC>
