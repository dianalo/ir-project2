HOME BUILDERS ENJOY BUSIESTQUARTER SINCE 1989  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Associated Press contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     At the same time, the number of new homes starting construction improved 62percent, according to Jim Grondzik of Grondzik Housing Research, the report'sauthor. That's up 57 percent from the same period a year ago.;    In AlamedaCounty, occupied units were up 54 percent and new housing starts up a whopping157 percent over the first quarter.;    Though some of the increases can beattributed to seasonal factors, some builders and economists are heralding theend of the worst home-builder's recession to hit the area since the early1980s.;    &quot;This is a notable turnaround. The bottom has been reached,&quot;Grondzik said.;    Others warn, however, that the upturn is probably onlytemporary and, as happened in June with the resale market, the new-home marketis in for a summer slowdown. One economist predicts that new-home constructionin Santa Clara County will still be off 15 percent from 1990 -- the thirdconsecutive year of decreased activity.;    The reasons for the upturn centeron improved buyer confidence, attractive mortgage interest rates and the factthat builders have reduced prices considerably -- more than 20 percent in somecases. Also, builders are concentrating on lower-priced homes.;    About 60percent of the new starts recorded in Santa Clara County in the most recentquarter were for condominiums and townhouses, the rest for more expensivedetached houses.;    Roger Menard, president of Kaufman and Broad South BayInc., said he has been selling an average of 10 houses and condominiums a weekover the last three months at a new project at Bernal Road and MontereyHighway in South San Jose that will eventually have 500 homes. For the 250homes now under construction, the condominiums range up to $180,000 and thehouses up to $280,000.;    &quot;It's been kind of a roller coaster,&quot; Menard said,noting that bursts of activity in February and March preceded a lull in Mayand early June. &quot;In the last three weeks, traffic has doubled. Buyers aremoving very cautiously, coming back four and five times, but they arebuying.&quot;;    Nonetheless, Joseph Wahed, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bankin San Francisco, said the new-home market is in for &quot;a breather.&quot; Said Wahed:&quot;Americans love to shop for homes in the early part of the year. (This spring)is an improvement. If compared to other recoveries, it's probably a little bitshort.&quot;;    National statistics back up that view. New-home sales nationwidesank 3.3 percent in May, the second straight monthly decline, according to areport released Wednesday by the departments of Commerce and of Housing andUrban Development.;    Even with the huge rise in new starts in Santa ClaraCounty, many developers are still finding it hard to obtain financing tobuild. Many lenders remain gun shy, troubled by tighter restrictions in thewake of the banking and Sandamp;L crisis and unsure of where California's housingmarket is heading.;    Lenders are requiring developers to share morefinancial risk in their projects, requiring them to put up 30 percent or moreof the project's value before lending.;    According to Grondzik, the numberof vacant lots controlled by developers, homes under construction, and homescompleted but vacant stood just under 10,000 in the second quarter in SantaClara County. That's down 162 from the first quarter -- a positive trend forbuilders -- but up from about 8,600 over the same period a year ago,indicating that lots of new housing is still available.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY ANNE OSTROM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910704  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  679  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 4, 199100186148,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
