In active trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil crashed through important price-support levels and closed at $15.92 a barrel, down 54 cents. The drop mirrored the European market, where North Sea Brent crude traded 50 cents lower, at $14.95 a barrel.    Oil markets had already been weak because of skepticism about OPEC's efforts to curtail overproduction. Analysts said new reports show that OPEC production in the first half of February has been around 17.8 million barrels a day, rather than the 16.8 million that had been expected.    Also, before trading opened yesterday, the Energy Department stunned traders by reporting a 8.5-million-barrel rise in U.S. crude stocks for last week. The American Petroleum Institute, in its weekly statistics released a day earlier, had reported a slight decrease of 1.9 million barrels.    The difference in the numbers was &quot;perplexing and surprising,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, oil analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. &quot;The whopping 8.5 (million) really sent shock waves into the market.&quot;    While the Energy Department number and an already weak European market (which also reacted to the stockpile statistics) started the New York sell-off, it picked up speed quickly as technical price-support levels were broken.    &quot;You had most of your computer-guided traders selling the market once the market opened lower,&quot; said Eric T. Bolling, a vice president at Geldermann Inc. on the Nymex floor.    Refiners, especially, showed interest in buying when crude was at $16 a barrel yesterday, but they backed off, looking for more appetizing numbers.    &quot;Refiners wanted to buy $16 crude oil, but it doesn't make much sense (to do that) if you can buy $15.50 crude oil,&quot; said Mr. Bolling. &quot;There is a need for crude, but you wait until there's a bit of a bottom in the market, or a bit of support, then you will see refiner buying.&quot;    Refined products also plunged, though not as badly as crude. On Nymex, current-delivery heating oil fell 1.18 cents to 45.22 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline 0.98 cent, to 45.37 cents a gallon.    Richard D. Donovan, head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s international-energy desk, said that with the reported higher OPEC production and other factors, &quot;I wouldn't be surprised to see lower prices in coming days.&quot; Short-term, Mr. Donovan said, $15.70 might be the bottom. At that point, traders might start buying again to take profits, boosting prices.    Mr. Barakat of Smith Barney said the fact that Saudi Arabia production has jumped along with the other 12 OPEC members is a &quot;really negative&quot; sign because the kingdom had been a great proponent of sticking to quotas.    According to Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders Futures Inc.'s energy group in New York, &quot;It seems right now everything is negative.&quot; Though the market will hesitate before dropping below $15.65, analysts said the fact the market closed under $16 yesterday indicates prices will go still lower today.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Current-delivery gold prices rose $1.30 an ounce, to $433.20, after plunging to 10-month lows Wednesday. Silver and platinum also closed higher. Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said the rises were a &quot;slight correction&quot; after recent plunges. With such a bearish market, traders with &quot;short&quot; positions -- betting the market will go still lower -- are sometimes quick to cover their positions if there is a sign of a small turnaround. &quot;The market got caught very bearish; it took little buying to start a correction,&quot; Mr. Mehta said. &quot;We could have a short-covering rally, then resume the downtrend.&quot;    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices, after rising in early trading, fell late in the day following a sharp drop in the bond-futures market. Arbitrage-related selling between stock futures and stocks, and the triggering of preset &quot;stop&quot; orders, added to the decline, traders said. Sell orders for several thousand Treasury-bond-futures contracts hit the market in early afternoon and sparked the collapse, said Gerald Walsh, a futures analyst with Refco Group Ltd., New York. Stock and stock-futures traders, anxious not to give up gains made in recent days, quickly turned tail and sold as well, said Alan Bush, a futures analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., Chicago. Treasury-bond futures for March settlement closed down 17/32 at 94 1/32, after trading as high as 95 3/8. Bellwether Standard andamp; Poor's 500 March stock-index futures closed down 2.35 at 262.85.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean prices tumbled as rains hit Brazil's bean-producing areas. Predictions by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics that the country will have a 19.4 million metric ton crop also damped traders' spirits. Soybeans for March settlement closed at $6.21 a bushel, down 3.75 cents. Corn and wheat futures finished lower.    SUGAR: March-delivery sugar dropped 0.40 cent a pound to 7.8 cents after a wire-service report said the Soviet Union had obtained a large quantity of raw sugar as part of a &quot;swap&quot; agreement. An estimated 1.25 million tons were involved, trade sources said. Most of that quantity was supplied by a European trading firm since Cuba couldn't meet its commitment because of crop difficulties, the sources said. The trading firm will be resupplied by Cuba later, according to the report. One analyst said this eliminated any urgency for the Soviet Union to buy sugar, and &quot;the market had been supported for months by the anticipation that the Soviets would buy a large quantity of sugar.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
