The decision by Judge Kurt J. Lewin of the CaliforniaSuperior Court is the latest of many rulings affecting one ofthe largest property and casualty insurance failures ever.</LP><TEXT>   If upheld, the opinion's principles could influence otherliquidation cases as courts pay increasing attention toonce-obscure contractual relationships between insurancecompanies and their reinsurers.   &quot;This landmark case of national importance sends a clearsignal to insurers and reinsurers that policyholders' rightsare paramount in California,&quot; said California InsuranceCommissioner John Garamendi. Lawyers representing thereinsurance companies couldn't be reached for comment.   Reinsurers underwrite a primary insurance company againstrisks that the primary company doesn't want to carry. Thetechnique, long used by conservative companies to distributerisks, also became a route to topsy-turvy growth by someinsurance companies in the 1980's.   In effect, the court held that Mission's reinsurers -- whodeclared that they could back away from obligations to payhundreds of millions of dollars to failed Mission -- wereseeking a preferential status in the company's liquidation.Reinsurance is the largest single asset available to stateregulators attempting to settle billions of dollars ofpolicyholders' claims. By one estimate, claims againstMission may ultimately exceed its assets by close to $2billion.   The assertion that reinsurers can rewrite history bydisavowing past contracts would create &quot;a preference notavailable to anyone else,&quot; Judge Lewin wrote in a five-pageopinion that was at times sharply critical of Mission'sdozens of reinsurers.   Among other things, Judge Lewin said that reinsurersbenefitted by years of profits from Mission's business andfailed to show the kind of vigilance that might haveprevented the alleged fraud. &quot;During the `good years' {thereinsurers} appear to have taken on an ostrich-like postureof `don't tell us anything we don't want to know,' while theycollected lucrative premiums.&quot;   Only &quot;as Mission approached financial difficulty {did thereinsurers} begin to make the inquiry they should have madeinitially and repudiated all of their reinsurance obligationsto Mission,&quot; the judge added.   He said reinsurers may bring claims for fraud againstMission, but noted that such claims would rank behind thoseof policyholders.   Mission, which was seized by state regulators in 1985 andwhich has been in liquidation proceedings since 1987,mushroomed in large part by channeling its risks toreinsurance companies, which enabled it to take on far morerisks than its relatively feeble balance sheet wouldotherwise have allowed.</TEXT></DOC>
