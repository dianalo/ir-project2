MikeNason of the 82nd Airborne Division headquartered at Fort Bragg,N.C., said at the Palmerola air force base. ``I don't want tospeculate, but the 82nd Airborne is a combat unit. Anything canhappen.''   Nason arrived in the first plane Thursday of an airlift of 3,200American soliers sent by the Reagan administration to Honduras.They were dispatched after Nicaraguan soldiers entered Honduranterritory in pursuit of U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras.   U.S. officials say the troops will not engage in combat. Theysay the troops are in Honduras for a training mission combined witha show of force and support for the Central American nation.   But Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has accused theUnited States of preparing to invade Nicaragua. President DanielOrtega said last week his forces are ready to ``liquidate'' theU.S. troops.   Nason, from Garden City, N.Y., said the American soldiers wouldbe surprised if they are called upon to do anything other thandemonstrate American support for Honduras.   ``Our orders remain that we're here to train. We're not here toenter into combat,'' he said.   The arrival of the 82nd Airborne and units of the 7th LightInfantry from Fort Ord, Calif., put U.S. strength in Honduras atabout 6,900, according to Maj. Gary Hovatter, the public affairsofficer for American troops in Honduras. The troops who had beenhere before the reinforcements were sent are assigned to variousU.S. facilities and engaged in training exercises.   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras asked for the additionalU.S. troops in hopes of forcing a Nicaraguan retreat and he saidSaturday he won't hesitate to ask for more U.S. assistance.   Azcona has asked for a U.S. helicopter airlift to help himdeploy Honduran troops in the mountainous Bocay border region wherethe Sandinistas crossed the frontier.   Despite the tense situation, the American soldiers at thePalmerola headquarters were relaxed Saturday. Many said they lookedforward to the training activities and nothing more.   ``I like it. It's fun,'' said Pfc. Shane Lawson of Columbus,Ohio. ``You can't train like this in the States, so we came downhere. And we get to train with Honduran troops.''   Sgt. Kenneth Martin Anderson said he was upset at protests backhome over the deployment.   ``They're protesting just to protest something,'' he said. `Theydon't understand that you can't have communists running free allover the place doing what they want to do. What happens if theUnited States gets attacked by communists?''   Anderson and Lawson were in a contingent of about 670 airbornesoldiers in camouflage battle dress who climbed into Blackhawk andChinook helicopters for the brief flight to their bivouack at thenearby base of Tamara.   Hovatter said the U.S. troops were sent to four Honduran bases:Tamara, just north of the capital; San Lorenzo in the south;Juticalpa, about 65 miles northeast of the area where the Nicarguanincursion took place, and Palmerola, 40 miles west of Tegucigalpa.   Nason denied Nicaraguan claims that the U.S. operation wasdesigned to bring in equipment for the Contras in their 6-year-oldwar against the leftist Sandinistas.   ``Wherever we go, the equipment goes. None of it will stayhere,'' he said.   Nason said the 82nd flew in two tanks, four Cobra combathelicopters, three light helicopters, more than 100 machine guns, adozen 105mm howitzers and several thousand rifles.   On the main highway through Tegucigalpa, people stopped to lookat a convoy of about 25 trucks filled with U.S. soldiers.   Reporters driving alongside the caravan asked the troopers wherethey were heading.   ``Nowhere!'' one soldier shouted.</TEXT></DOC>
