However,actual biomass production in most plantations is well under this productivity.A research project including experimental field trials was designed toincrease biomass production of Eucalyptus globulus having in mind a possiblebiomass utilization for energy and fiber. The basic assumptions in thisproject are that biomass production is a function of the solar radiationintercepted by the foliage and that the efficiency with which solar radiationis converted into biomass by a given genotype under a given climate isinfluenced by soil fertility and water availability. The project includesan experimental site of approximately 25 000 square m, where four treatmentswill be applied to the Eucalyptus globulus plantation: optimal waterand optimal nutrients; optimal water; no water, no nutrients (control);nutrients. The effects of mineral nutrition and irrigation will be studiedin relation to tree growth, photosynthetic capacity, biomass productionand partition, seasonal variation in plant water stress, food and energyreserves accumulation and utilization, chemical composition and characteristicsof wood as related to use as pulp fiber source. The present project willallow multi-disciplinary research aiming at an integrated view of thefunctioning of these plantations. The experimental design allows supportof additional research and is open to collaborative programs. (Refs.10).</TEXT></DOC>
