(product specifications).andO;Ticker:    NOVL.andO;Product:   NetWare 2.1x (Computer network software) (design andconstruction).andO;Topic:     TutorialUninterruptible Power SupplyFile ServersLocal Area NetworksPower SupplyMonitors.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Step By StepandM;Most network LAN managers agree that the critical network server requires theprotection of special power protection devices called uninterruptible powersupplies (UPS).andP;  If the file server has a UPS, and the building power goesout, your network server will not.andP;  A self-contained battery pack in the UPStakes over and provides the necessary power to ride out minor outages andallows for an orderly shutdown when the outage is for an extended period oftime.andM;Novell provides an added feature in the latest 2.1X versions of NetWare.andP;  Youcan now add UPS monitoring to the file server which interfaces with manypopular UPS systems.andP;  Not only will the power be maintained in the event of apower outage, but the server will automatically send out a message to allusers that are connected that notifies them when the server is on auxiliarypower.andP;  If the UPS has not had its building power restored in a predeterminedperiod (estimated based on the size of the UPS and the load on the UPS), itwill automatically close all files and down the server gracefully.andM;Great, you say.andP;  And so it is.andP;  The only problem with the whole process isthat the documentation for the UPS monitor board installation is either verysketchy, in error, or not provided.andM;To save you hours of trouble, we will describe the various Novell UPS monitorboards and how to get them installed properly.andP;  It should be noted thatNetWare versions 2.10 through 2.12 set the necessary UPS parameters in adifferent manner than is required in NetWare version 2.15.andP;  More on thislater.andM;It should be noted that American Power and Elgar UPS systems use the defaultsettings as described throughout this article.andP;  You should check with othermanufacturers to confirm their battery low and online input settings.andM;DCB InstallationandM;If your Novell server uses Disk Controller Boards (DCB) you will need to knowthe UPS I/O address.andP;  This might be a little confusing.andP;  NetWare 2.10documentation has finally gotten it right.andP;  You will have to know the exactI/O monitoring address (which is 6 bytes above the base I/O address).andP;  Theseare the I/O numbers that will be required at a later time in a UPSconfiguration file.andM;Channel 1 UPS I/O Info: 346h Channel 2 UPS I/O Info: 34Eh Channel 3 UPS I/OInfo: 326h Channel 4 UPS I/O Info: 32EhandM;There are two selectable sets of jumper switch options that must be set onthe DCB with UPS monitoring included.andP;  They should be set as follows:andM;Jumper 18: Set for closed contact for battery low input.andP;  Use S17 if your UPSuses open for battery low input.andM;Jumper 19: Set for closed contract for battery online input.andP;  Use S20 if yourUPS uses open for battery low input.andM;Serialized Keycard/UPSandM;Monitor Card InstallationandM;If you are not using DCBs, you will need a separate UPS monitor card.andP;  Novelloffers two varieties.andP;  Both have the Novell part number designation ofNUL-J-65115.andP;  Both are called Novell UPS monitor boards.andP;  Both perform thesame function.andP;  Either can be shipped to you when a UPS board is ordered.andO;They both are half size cards.andP;  But, each has different configuration optionsand settings.andP;  Be careful!andM;You will either receive a standalone UPS monitor card or a softwareserialized keycard/UPS monitor card.andP;  The keycard no longer has anyserialization on board.andP;  Novell serialization is now done through the NetWaresoftware (GENDATA disk).andM;The standalone UPS monitor card has three sets of selectable jumpers.andP;  Thekeycard monitor card has five sets of jumpers.andM;The standalone UPS card can use I/O address 231h or 240h.andP;  Since 240h is theprimary NL-1000 (File Server LocalTalk Card) setting, I would suggest usingthe 231h setting.andP;  The standalone UPS card should be set up as follows to use231h:andM;Jumper 1: S2 Set for closed contact for battery low input.andP;  Use S1 if yourUPS uses open for battery low input.andM;Jumper 2: S3 Set for closed contact for UPS online input.andP;  Use S4 if your UPSuses open for online input.andM;Jumper 3: S6 Set for I/O address 231h.andP;  Use S5 for I/O address 240h.andM;The keycard/UPS monitor card uses I/O address 230h.andP;  The five switches onthis board should be set as follows:andM;Jumper 1: S2 Set for closed contact for battery low input.andP;  Use S1 if yourUPS uses open for battery low input.andM;Jumper 2: S4andM;Jumper 3: S5 Default settings.andP;  Do not change.andM;Jumper 4: S8andM;Jumper 5: S10 Set for closed contact for UPS online input.andP;  Use S9 if yourUPS uses open for on-line input.andM;PS/2 InstallationandM;IBM PS/2 machines do not require a special UPS monitoring board.andP;  Instead themouse port is used.andP;  An added procedure that provides the means for the PC tohave the mouse port serve as the UPS interface is required:andM;Insert a backup copy of the &quot;IBM Reference Disk&quot; into Drive A and boot up theserver.andM;After pressing ENTER, you will be given the option to change theconfiguration.andP;  Depress the Page Down key.andM;Since the UPS option has not been defined, select &quot;No&quot; at the prompt forautomatic configuration.andM;Select, copy an option disk and ENTER.andM;Insert the &quot;Novell Diagnostics&quot; disk and complete the copy process.andM;Select, set configuration and ENTER.andM;Select, change configuration and ENTER.andM;Highlight the keycard/UPS card entry and choose an I/O address that does notconflict with other system options.andP;  The F6 key will toggle through availableoptions.andP;  An asterisk next to the I/O address indicates a conflict.andM;Press F10 to save.andM;Hit ESCAPE to exit the Reference Program.andM;UPS Configuration FileandM;InstallationandM;At a workstation that has established a connection to the server, you willneed to set up an appropriate UPS configuration file.andP;  For NetWare versions2.10 through 2.12 you will create a unique CONFIG.UPS text file in the SYSTEMdirectory.andP;  NetWare version 2.15 incorporates the UPS monitoring statementsin a SERVER.CFG text file, to be located in the SYSTEM directory.andM;Both the SERVER.CFG and CONFIG.UPS have similar monitoring statements.andP;  TheSERVER.CFG may also contain additional unrelated commands.andP;  The order inwhich these statements are included within these files is irrelevant.andP;  Thewait and down times should be chosen based upon UPS size and loading.andP;  Sometesting is recommended.andM;* SERVER.CFG (v.andP;  2.15)andM;UPS TYPE=andM;Choose 1 to 4.andP;  UPS IO=XXXandM;This is the hex monitor card I/O address.andP;  Do not include this statement forPS/2 installs.andM;UPS WAIT=XXXandM;The wait time for message of server on auxiliary power, from 15 to 300seconds.andM;UPS DOWN=XXandM;The time on auxiliary power for a server shutdown, from 1 to 30 minutes.andM;* CONFIG.UPS (v.andP;

 Connect the UPS monitor cable (make sure you specify one when youorder your UPS, indicating either a standard or PS/2 server) to the UPS andthe file server monitor card (standard server) or mouse port (PS/2 server).andM;Power on the UPS, and then the server.andP;  Upon boot up, the server will displaythe message &quot;UPS has been enabled&quot; if all is well.andM;If you get the message, &quot;Invalid configuration in SERVER.CFG or CONFIG.UPS&quot;check out all statements.andP;  The (UPS) Type or (UPS) I/O is most likely inerror.andM;Glenn Fund is a principal research specialist at Sanders Associates where hecoordinates all LAN installations.andP;  He is founder and co-director of theGreater Boston Area Novell Users Group and is a SYSOP on the NetWireCompuServe Forums.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
