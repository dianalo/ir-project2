Middle grade schools could be a strong positive influence onadolescents as they face a world in which they are tempted toexperiment with alcohol, sex and drugs, according to the report by atask force of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development.   Instead, ``many large middle grade schools function as mills thatcontain and process endless streams of students. Within them aremasses of anonymous youth,'' said the study. ``Such settingsvirtually guarantee that the intellectual and emotional needs ofyouth will go unmet.''   The report, titled ``Turning Points: Preparing American Youth forthe 21st Century,'' was released Sunday on the first day of athree-day meeting sponsored by the Carnegie Corp. of New York tofocus on ways to improve mid-level schools.   Of the 28 million U.S. children between ages 10 and 17,one-fourth may face futures in ``serious jeopardy'' because of theconsequences of school dropout, drug use or early, unprotected sex,the study said, citing research conducted for an upcoming book,``Adolescents at Risk,'' by Joy G. Dryfoos. Another 7 millionchildren may be at moderate risk, it said.   Students who drop out of school or emerge semiliterate cannotcompete for jobs requiring literate, technically trained workers.   ``What is left for these young men and women is a life on theedge of society,'' the report said.   The study said middle schools should be restructured on a ``morehuman scale'' by:   _Creating smaller environments for learning by dividing largeschools into ``schools within schools'' where children know eachother and their teachers better.   _Teaching a core academic program aimed at producing students whoare literate, understand the sciences and have a sense of health,ethics and citizenship.   _Eliminating use of ``tracking'' students by achievement level,which the report said essentially dooms many children to failure.   _Giving teachers and administrators more creative power, andhiring teachers who specialize in dealing with young adolescents.   _Involving parents and community leaders in the schools.   _Boosting students' health and fitness with more in-schoolprograms and by helping those who need public health care to get it.   The study suggested dividing schools into smaller communities of200 to 500 students who represent a cross-section of the school interms of ethnic and socioeconomic background and intellectualability. Those students would be teamed with a set of teachers whowould work together to provide a more unified learning environment.   For example, separate classes in English, arts, history andsocial studies could be organized around a single theme such asimmigration, the report said. Students should be given long-termwriting assignments and national achievement tests should beexpanded to judge students on the basis of an overall workportfolio, it said.   Some classes should be longer than the 40- to 50-minute norm, andeach student ``should be well known by at least one adult'' atschool who can provide counseling and academic help, the reportrecommended.   The result, the report said, should be ``a thinking, productive,caring and healthy person who takes seriously the responsibility ofgood citizenship.''   ``Our vision is of such an outcome for every youth of the nation,not just for those more advantaged than others,'' it said.   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,praised the report, saying it ``recognizes it is not too late toimprove the educational opportunities of those students who arealready in school.''   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrellsaid she agreed with the report's recommendations, ``but the realityis that we must lay the groundwork for school success long beforethese tumultuous years.''   ``We must begin earlier than grades six, seven or eight,'' shesaid. ``We must prime our youngest students for academic success.''</TEXT></DOC>
