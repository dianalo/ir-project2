Don Edwards (D., Calif.), chairman of the civil and constitutional rights subcommittee. &quot;I am thinking seriously of sometime early next year taking another quick look at this issue and writing the beginnings of an FBI charter.&quot;    Rep. Edwards and other members of the panel appeared to agree with recommendations from four witnesses that there should be one standard, instead of the current two sets of guidelines, for Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiries into domestic terrorism and that the standard should be written into law instead of left to the attorney general to determine.    One witness, Morton Halperin, director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he believes that &quot;all investigations of political organizations should be based on public, codified guidelines and should include frequent review to ensure that they stay within the prescribed bounds.&quot;    Mr. Halperin added: &quot;The ACLU believes that one publicly enunciated standard should apply for all criminal intelligence investigations.&quot;    Spurring yesterday's hearings was the FBI's handling of an investigation into the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, or CISPES.    According to FBI documents released in January and comments by FBI officials since then, the agency's investigation began in September 1981 as an inquiry into alleged criminal violations of domestic security laws. Specifically, the FBI was looking into whether CISPES was supplying money and material to leftist rebels in El Salvador.    That investigation was closed the following February. But in March 1983, the FBI began a new investigation of CISPES under a different set of guidelines, those governing international terrorism. Although much of those guidelines are classified, it is known that they give the FBI far more sweeping authority to investigate U.S. citizens. </TEXT></DOC>
