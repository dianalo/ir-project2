The Director, Northwest Region, NMFS(Regional Director), has determined that the adjustments are necessaryto prolong the all-species commercial seasons in these subareas and toprovide for equitable distribution of harvest among Oregon ports.

Robinson at 206-526-6140.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Regulations governing the ocean salmonfisheries are published at 50 CFR Part 661. In its preseason notice of1989 management measures (54 FR 19798, May 8, 1989), NOAA specified landinglimits, landing boundaries, and ratio fisheries (restriction on the ratioof coho to chinook salmon which can be landed) for the commercial seasonsfor all salmon species in the subareas from Cape Falcon to Cascade Head,and from Cascade Head to Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon. NOAA also announcedthat the troll fishery from Cape Falcon, Oregon, to the U.S.-Mexico borderwould be limited to an overall preseason catch quota of 474,000 coho salmon.A subarea catch ceiling within the overall catch quota allows a catch ofno more than 349,000 coho salmon south of Cascade Head, Oregon. In accordance with the preseason notice, the commercial season betweenCape Falcon and Cape Arago, Oregon, was closed for 3 days, July 15-17,when 75 percent of the commercial catch ceiling of 349,000 coho salmonsouth of Cascade Head, Oregon, was projected to have been reached (54 FR30390, July 20, 1989). During this 3-day closure, an assessment was conductedto determine whether landing limits or ratio fisheries should be continuedor imposed. Based on the most recent catch rates, it is projected that more restrictivelanding requirements would delay the attainment of the commercial cohocatch quota and ceiling and prolong the allspecies commercial seasons betweenCape Falcon and Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, for 1-2 weeks. After thecommercial coho quota or ceiling has been reached, fishing will continuein the affected subarea for all salmon species except coho salmon. Consequently, NOAA issues this notice to establish the following landinglimits, landing boundaries, and ratio fisheries effective 0001 hours localtime, July 18, 1989. For the subarea between Cape Falcon and Cascade Head,Oregon, a single daily landing limit per vessel of 50 coho salmon is established,and all loads which have been caught in this subarea must be landed northof Cascade Head, Oregon. For the subarea between Cascade Head and OrfordReef Red Buoy, a ratio restriction of 1 chinook salmon for every 2 cohosalmon landed is established, the first 2 coho salmon may be landed withouta chinook salmon, and all loads which have been caught in this subareamust be landed south of Cascade Head, Oregon. The subarea from Cape Aragoto Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, is closed July 14-31 as regularly scheduled.This notice does not apply to other fisheries which may be operating inother areas. The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife regardingthese adjustments to commercial landing restrictions between Cape Falconand Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon. The State of Oregon will manage the commercialfishery in State waters adjacent to this area of the EEZ in accordancewith this federal action. In accordance with the revised inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.20,661.21, and 661.23, actual notice to fishermen was given prior to 0001hours local time, July 18, 1989, by telephone hotline number (206) 526-6667and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts on Channel 16 VHF-FMand 2182 KHz. NOAA issues this notice of revised landing restrictions forthe commercial salmon fishery in the EEZ from Cape Falcon to Orford ReefRed Buoy, Oregon, which was effective 0001 hours local time, July 18, 1989.Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce hasdetermined that good cause exists for this notice to be issued withoutaffording a prior opportunity for public comment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters </ITAG>This action is authorized by 50 CFR 661.23 and is in compliance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe D.
