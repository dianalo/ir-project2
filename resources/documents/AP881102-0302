The loan through Bank of America and Salomon Brothers Inc. is thefirst in Venezuela to link oil revenues directly to repayment, saidFinance Minister Hector Hurtado Navarro.   ``This operation will not affect the income of our oil company,it will not affect oil prices and it will not generate additionalfiscal income. It is so we don't keep eating up our internationalreserves,'' Hurtado told a news conference.   The operation was approved in Wednesday's regular cabinetmeeting, he said.   According to Hurtado, a New York trust fund will be establishedfor the Central Bank of Venezuela, which will receive payments fromChamplin Oil Refining Co. and Citgo Petroleum Co. under seven-yearcrude oil contracts the refiners have with the state oil companyPetroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).   PDVSA owns half of both refining firms, and recently announced itwill exercise an option to buy the other half of Champlin for around$70 million.   Combined the companies purchase around 200,000 barrels per day ofcrude oil from PDVSA, or around 6 million barrels a month, Hurtadosaid. The monthly payments on the oil currently amount to around $78million, based on oil prices of around $13 per barrel, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
