The negotiations concluded Wednesday evening with plans toresume Thursday, the 30th day of the walkout, in the office offederal mediator Doug Hammond.   Meanwhile, the state's chief economist, Chang Mook Sohn, saidWednesday he doubted the strike would have much effect on thestate's robust economy unless it runs at least three more months.   ``The other factors in the economy are very strong and so farare offsetting any impact the strike has had,'' he said.   Hammond has said he hoped to keep the two sides meeting until asettlement is reached.   ``The longer they go, the better it is,'' said Jack Daniels ofDistrict Lodge 751, International Association of Machinists andAerospace Workers. ``My understanding is that they're talking aboutthe big three issues.''   Union leaders have said the top issues are pay, mandatoryovertime and pensions.   The Machinists represent 57,800 Boeing workers, including 43,300in the local district lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 inPortland, Ore.; and a few hundred at scattered sites in California,Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other states.   In an 85 percent strike vote Oct. 3, the day before the walkoutbegan, union members rejected a three-year offer with annual payraises of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, and bonuses of 8percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second.   Also included were cost-of-living increases to virtually coverinflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime from 200 to 160 hoursper quarter and higher benefits.   Boeing officials have said the total dollars in the rejectedoffer would not be increased. Union leaders have said there can beno settlement without more money.   Meanwhile, full-scale bargaining was set to begin Thursday, aday later than originally planned, on a contract for Boeing'ssecond-largest union, the Seattle Professional EngineeringEmployees Association, which represents about 28,000 engineers andtechnical workers.   The union's contract expires Dec. 1, and both sides say a strikeis unlikely.</TEXT></DOC>
