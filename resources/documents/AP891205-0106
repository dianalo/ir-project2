SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Changes in the Earth's climate could encouragethe spread of diseases like encephalitis and rabies, while at thesame time damaging the human body's ability to fight them, aconference on climate and health was told Tuesday.   Potential problems stem both from the increase in ultravioletradiation, as the protective ozone layer in the stratsophere isdamaged, and from climate warming, which many scientists believe isoccurring in a so-called Greenhouse effect.   Ultraviolet radiation, already known to cause skin cancer, alsohas a major effect in reducing the response of the human immunesystem, said Dr. Raymond Daynes of the University of Utah.   ``There is really no advantage to sunbathing. Your skin isreally not meant to withstand ultraviolet radiation,'' Daynes toldthe conference on ``Global Atmospheric Change and Public Health.''   Ultraviolet radiation, he said, ``in addition to being a potentcarcinogen, appears able to modify, or suppress, the immunesystem.''   Levels of ultraviolet radiation are considered likely toincrease as ozone is depleted in the upper atmosphere, whereman-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons destroy theprotective layer. Already a seasonal reduction in ozone, known asan ozone hole, occurs at the South Pole.   At the same time this immune system damage is being threatened,warming of the climate could lead to the spread of diseasescurrently limited by the climate, added Dr. Robert E. Shope of theYale University School of Medicine.   And Dr. Susanne Holmes Giannini of the University of MarylandSchool of Medicine added that ultraviolet radiation also increasesthe effects of many diseases that affect the skin or start on theskin.   Skin disesases such as leprosy, smallpox, skin ulcers andinfections and herpes could be worsened by increases in radiation,she said, as could diseases that enter the body through the skinsuch as anthrax, bubonic plague, yaws, some types of diptheria,African sleeping sickness and others.   In one series of tests, she said, mice infected with what isnormally a skin disease developed fewer skin ulcers underultraviolet radiation, but between 15 percent and 40 percent ofthem died. Thus, she concluded, ultraviolet radiation seems able toconvert one normally non-fatal disease into a fatal one.   ``Most human infectious diseases will probably not be greatlyinfluenced by climate change,'' said Shope. But, he added, thoseaffected by climate, such as diseases carried by mosquitoes, likelywill be.   The change is hard to predict without known how much or how fastclimate will change, he said, noting that while the Greenhouseeffect is widely discussed, scientists disagree over whether it hasactually begun and how much warming might occur.   If there is a warmer climate, said Shope, possible problemsmight include the spread of bat-borne rabies as vampire bats fromSouth and Central America extend their range to the north, spreadof dengue and yellow fever and an increase in St. Louisencephalitis.   Normally that form of encephalitis, which is particularlyserious in older people, occurs in an epidemic every decade or so,the last one having been in 1975.   Mosquitoes breeding in sewage spread the disease, he said, andwarm, dry years favor its expansion.   Other diseases causes by parasites might also spread, he said.But he added that there is no way of predicting exactly whichdiseases may expand, which could be reduced, or when.</TEXT></DOC>
