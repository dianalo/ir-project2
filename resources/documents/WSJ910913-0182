The records provide further details regarding therecollections of Richard Kerr, then deputy director forintelligence and a close associate of Mr. Gates, PresidentBush's nominee to head the CIA. Mr. Kerr has said he told Mr.Gates of speculation of a diversion months before it becamepublic, and the notes indicate further that he remembers Mr.Gates reacting with little surprise, as if he had heard thesame warning previously.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gates has said he has no memory of the conversationwith Mr. Kerr in August 1986, but the different accounts bythe two men create an awkward conflict given their standingin the agency. Mr. Kerr's fortunes in the CIA have beenclosely linked to Mr. Gates's own career, and the formerdeputy is the acting CIA director as Mr. Gates begins Senateconfirmation hearings next week.   According to persons familiar with the notes, the CIApapers have surfaced as part of the preparations for thesehearings, and Mr. Kerr has apparently stuck with the accountreflected in the records. The notes stem from a 1987interview of Mr. Kerr by investigators for House and SenateIran-Contra committees and were prepared by the CIA for itsown records of the questioning.   Mr. Kerr was unavailable for comment yesterday, hisspokesman said.   The Iran-Contra operation was already under way when Mr.Gates became deputy director of the CIA, but a major issue ishis failure to more aggressively pursue evidence that profitswere being diverted to fund the war in Nicaragua. Through thesummer of 1986, agency officials were increasingly aware ofIranian complaints of being overcharged for weapons, and inAugust, CIA analyst Charles Allen expressed fears to Mr. Kerrthat money was being diverted to the Contras.   After this discussion, Mr. Kerr has said he met with Mr.Gates informally and passed along Mr. Allen's speculation.However, it wasn't until Mr. Allen met directly with Mr.Gates on Oct. 1 that the deputy director began to takeaction. Even then, Mr. Gates appeared more preoccupied withprotecting the agency's flank than pursuing the evidencepresented to him.   Mr. Allen is expected to testify next week regarding theanalysis behind his early warnings of the diversion, and Mr.Kerr's account indicates that Mr. Gates may have heard ofsuch speculation from other quarters as well. The timing ofthe conversation is important because the entire Iran-Contraoperation ran into trouble in the late summer of 1986, and itis in this same period that Alan Fiers, then chief of theCIA's Central American task force, has said he learned thatarms profits were helping to pay for an air-supply operationto support the Nicaraguan insurgents.   Mr. Fiers has said Clair George, then director of theCIA's operations division, was also aware of the diversion,and his testimony has led to the indictment of Mr. George formaking false statements and obstructing congressionalinvestigations into the Iran-Contra affair. Mr. George hasvowed to fight the charges and pleaded innocent yesterday atarraignment in federal court here.</TEXT></DOC>
