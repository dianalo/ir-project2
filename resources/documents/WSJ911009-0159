An IBM spokesman declined to comment, but the executivessaid IBM made the decision late last week. They said IBM hasdelayed an announcement until it can find homes for itssoftware products elsewhere in IBM or can find companies thatwant to buy the rights to them.</LP><TEXT>   Disbanding the operation will have little impact on thecomputer giant's business, but is at least a mildembarrassment.   IBM had decided in late 1988 that it ought to be able tograb a chunk of the personal-computer application-softwarebusiness, given its strong position selling hardware andoperating-system software. The idea was that IBM wouldidentify applications at small companies that were &quot;best ofbreed.&quot; IBM would then bring its huge development resourcesto bear on polishing the products and would put its marketingmight behind them. IBM would get rights to the products sothat, as the products prospered, IBM would, too.   But IBM assembled only a few products, and none of thembecame hugely successful. The industry executives said IBMwas once close to a deal with Borland International Inc. tobuy rights to Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradoxdata-base package, both of which have become big names, butthe talks fizzled.   The industry executives said the IBM Desktop Softwarebusiness was at least marginally profitable, but added thatit never grew beyond several hundred employees, who will nowfind jobs elsewhere at IBM. The executives said IBM, which istaking a hard look at all its businesses these days, decidedto shift its resources to focus more on the underlying levelsof software that let applications talk to each other.   Separately, IBM's French subsidiary said it will seek tocut 1,000 jobs by next March. That's on top of the 1,000 jobsthe company earlier this year said it planned to eliminate.The 2,000 jobs represent 10% of IBM's total work force inFrance at the beginning of this year.   IBM France's revenue dropped 2.1% last year to $7.08billion, at current exchange rates, as the whole Europeancomputer market softened following years of strong growth.Earnings at IBM France fell 14% to $385 million. The unit'sresults are expected to decline again this year in localcurrencies. The numbers will look even worse when they appearon the parent company's books, because the strengtheningdollar will reduce their value when they are translated intoU.S. currency.   The move by IBM France brings to 18,000 the number of jobsthat IBM has said it will cut world-wide since the beginningof 1991. That will reduce IBM's work force to 356,000. Andthe number is widely expected to shrink even further, asother IBM operations step up their cost-cutting efforts andas U.S. employees feel the effects of a recent push to makeemployee evaluations much tougher.   An IBM spokesman also confirmed Japanese reports that thecompany had agreed to sell memory chips to a rival computercompany. The arrangement is unusual, because IBM typicallybuilds chips only for its own use. But IBM has made severalsuch sales in the past, and the spokesman said the agreementwas designed just to soak up some excess capacity IBM has formaking so-called four-megabit memory chips.   IBM has for several months been trying to find ways tomake better use of its technology base and manufacturingcapacity, but it has repeatedly said it doesn't want to jumpinto the semiconductor market. IBM has said semiconductorplants are too expensive and the market too cyclical for itto be attractive.   Although the spokesman declined to identify the buyer,industry executives said it is Hyundai Group of South Korea.They said the agreement involves more chips than past IBMdeals but added that it is still small by semiconductorindustry standards.</TEXT></DOC>
