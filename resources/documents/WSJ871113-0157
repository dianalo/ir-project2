The International Trade Commission imposed the ban -- believed to have been the first time that import of a foreign company's semiconductors had ever been halted -- after finding Samsung had violated Texas Instruments' so-called &quot;intellectual property.&quot; The ban, however, was never truly in effect, as Texas Instruments immediately granted temporary licenses to Samsung customers importing the chips.    But while the licensing agreements put the importation question to rest, a Texas Instruments spokesman said it is still pressing some remaining patent issues against Samsung in U.S. District Court in Dallas. The issues involve the strength of the patents and their interpretation, he said, but he couldn't elaborate.    Texas Instruments filed suit against Samsung and eight Japanese chip makers in January 1986, alleging they were making semiconductors based on Texas Instruments' patents. In February 1986, it filed a related complaint with the trade commission.    In the agreement, Texas Instruments granted the South Korean company licenses on Texas Instruments' patents of dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAMs, one of the most basic components of computers and other electronic gear. As part of the agreement, which expires in 1990, Texas Instruments will receive fixed royalty payments as well as per-unit royalties based on Samsung's use of its U.S. DRAM patents. The size of the royalties wasn't disclosed.    Texas Instruments said the agreement was &quot;generally in conformance&quot; with those it reached this year with eight Japanese semiconductor makers. Analysts said they expect Texas Instruments would probably gain about $4 million a year from the per-unit portion of the licensing agreement.    The agreement is subject to approval by the South Korean government. </TEXT></DOC>
