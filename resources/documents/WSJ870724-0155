Nevertheless the column caused some dismay since different conclusions can be drawn from the same facts.    Your characterization of the Jewish community &quot;growing apart&quot; does not fully portray our broad-based consensus when it comes to crucial issues such as Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, its security, its democracy and its steadfast support as an American ally. The Jewish community is also unified when it comes to the rescue of imperiled Jewish populations, as in Ethiopia in 1984, the right of Soviet Jews and all Jews to emigrate, the fight against anti-Semitism wherever it may arise, and the responsibility of American Jews to contribute their generous share to the resolution of pressing social problems in the U.S.    The &quot;growing apart&quot; that you report is really our &quot;growing up.&quot; Differences of opinion, freely expressed, are a reflection of the colorful diversity and ripening maturity within the Jewish community, both in Israel and in America. This diversity undergirds and strengthens our community; it does not diminish our unity on matters of crucial interest, and it adds to the vibrance and excitement of being involved in Jewish life and in the United Jewish Appeal.    The UJA is the largest and most comprehensive single effort of the American Jewish community and as such it embodies this fundamental Jewish unity. It works in tandem with 200 local Jewish federations in large cities, and includes 400 other locally based UJA campaigns in smaller communities. Together we involve more than a million contributors and hundreds of thousands of volunteers. The UJA's annual fund-raising campaign continues to grow each year, reflecting the enthusiasm for the cause and reaching levels that are admired by any standard.    Your article called attention to differing views about the support of educational activities in Israel sponsored by the various streams of Judaism. It is important to understand that the overwhelming proportion of UJA funds spent in Israel and throughout the Jewish world is on behalf of noncontroversial humanitarian requirements of Jewish rescue and rehabilitation, and health and human service programs.    Stanley B. Horowitz   President   United Jewish Appeal   New York   ---   How tragic that the Journal, too, has fallen prey to the new strategy of those who, for their own interests, seek to portray Orthodox Jewry in Israel as representing a rising, recent tide of religious fundamentalism. There were many misleading and plainly false allegations in your article emanating from Reform and secular elements concerning orthodoxy and United Jewish Appeal allocations.    It is the Reform leadership that has tried to wield UJA -- a charity fund -- as a political tool in its struggle against orthodoxy, not the other way around. UJA monies always have been disbursed in Israel based on the number of individuals serviced by various institutions. If the ratio of welfare beneficiaries in Orthodox as opposed to Reform institutions is lopsided, that is simply because the number of Reform Jews in Israel is minuscule.    The article reported that &quot;only&quot; about $2.5 million of UJA funds were earmarked last year for Conservative and Reform institutions in Israel, compared with $30 million for Orthodox institutions (a proportion of 8%). It failed to note that the same study that produced these figures acknowledged that Reform and Conservative Jews together make up barely 1% of the Israeli population. In essence, Reform leaders want to use charity funds to implant their own ideology on foreign soil.    It is convenient to paint the Israeli scene as &quot;increasingly dominated by religiously fundamentalist and politically militant Jewish immigrants from Arab countries, rather than the European Holocaust survivors who built the Israel most American Jews identify with.&quot; But this rings hollow in view of the examples cited, such as the fact that marriage and divorce in Israel are governed by Orthodox Jewish law. This principle was hammered out in good faith between the Jewish Agency (dominated, incidentally, by Jews of European origin) and representatives of Orthodox Jewry, even before the inception of the state!    Rabbi Yitzchok Brandriss   Director of Public Affairs   Agudath Israel of America   New York   ---   We were surprised to learn of the misinterpretation of a resolution attributed to the Reformed Congregation in Indianapolis. The Reform congregation does not make contributions to the Jewish Welfare Federation, United Jewish Appeal or any other organization that we know of.    There is no reference in the resolution to sending its contributions directly, but rather urging the federation to &quot;explore the possibility of taking control over the funds that are allocated toward religious institutions in Israel and directly allocate them in order to have them distributed in the manner more in keeping with our local institutions.&quot; This has nothing to do with the contribution process, but rather with an allocations process of the Jewish Welfare Federation.    Jerry Litwack   President   Harry Nadler   Executive Vice President   Jewish Welfare Federation Inc.   Indianapolis   ---   If Jews argue with God, why not with each other? Giving advice or strongly suggesting comes naturally, so this apparent rift just isn't.    Lloyd Sellinger   Newport Beach, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
