The action came as separate negotiations cleared the wayfor a 23% salary increase for senators as part of a $2.3billion legislative bill that seeks to equalize pay in bothhouses while establishing a common ban on the honoraria andstipends still earned by members of the Senate.</LP><TEXT>   Senate salaries would increase to $125,100 a year, whilethe three top leaders -- Majority Leader George Mitchell,Republican Leader Robert Dole and Sen. Robert Byrd, thepresident pro tempore -- would receive $138,900. Uponenactment of the bill, senators could no longer keep speakingfees, and rules governing stipends and gifts would betightened.   The House leadership has scheduled floor action on themeasure today. But in behind-the-scenes maneuvering over thepast two weeks, Senate leaders were frustrated in theirefforts to increase their pay to $153,000 as part of the samepackage. The proposal, advanced by Sen. Mitchell with supportfrom Sens. Dole and Byrd, would have applied to those threemen as well as the top party leaders in the House, but it metobjections there from senior Republicans as well asDemocrats.   The Senate's eagerness to increase its pay follows itsdecision in the last Congress to forgo a salary increase infavor of keeping often lucrative speaking fees from privateinterests. The proposed adjustments would put the twochambers back on a more equal footing, but as a practicalmatter some senior senators at least will enjoy a one-shotwindfall of sorts because they will receive the pay increasewhile having already earned their maximum honoraria of about$23,000 for this year.   Though it received less attention, the complex energy andwater bill negotiated by conferees yesterday is its own worldof competing regional and corporate interests. The largeTexas delegation and an army of contractors helped secure the$483 million promised for the superconducting supercollider,while labor and California utilities were a force behind the$173.5 million allocated for solar energy, a 34% increasefrom current funding.   Louisiana and West Virginia senators added tens ofmillions of dollars for homestate water projects. NewJersey's new influence on the panel helped secure financingfor a costly Passaic River flood-water and drainage projectas well as a 23% increase for magnetic-fusion researchimportant to Princeton University.   As much as $70 million was provided for 10 university andmedical projects, five of which weren't in the underlyingbills. In addition, Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) used hisposition to substantially increase military funding fornuclear laboratories in the Southwest and California managedby the University of California and American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.'s ATandamp;T Technologies Inc. subsidiary.   Agreement on the energy and pay provisions came as theSenate approved a $53.1 billion agriculture and ruraldevelopment bill that makes deep cuts from the House-passedbudget for the Food and Drug Administration. The measure alsohas become a battleground for competing forces in the NorthCarolina tobacco industry. An amendment backed by Sen. JesseHelms (R., N.C.) would effectively bar the enforcement of newrules designed to better track the mixing of foreign tobaccowith U.S.-grown leaf.   Mr. Helms's office said the rules had been foundcumbersome and unworkable by the administration, but theinitiative has had strong support from Rep. Charles Rose, aNorth Carolina Democrat and senior member of the HouseAgriculture panel who has cast himself as a champion of thegrowers who are opposed to cigarette companies and exporters.   More broadly, Mr. Helms continues to pepper bills thissummer with amendments fulfilling his conservative agenda,and a $22.1 billion measure concerning the State, Justice andCommerce Departments became his latest target last night. TheRepublican added language barring federal prisoners fromreceiving college education grants. And a second Helmsprovision on AIDS testing, adopted after an unsuccessful55-44 tabling motion, would impose a sweeping mandate onstates to adopt laws overriding &quot;informed consent&quot;requirements and empowering doctors to require patients to betested for AIDS before surgery or certain dental procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
