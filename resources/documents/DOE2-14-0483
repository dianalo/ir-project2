While digital subtractionangiography has been used for studying peripheral vasculature for severalyears, it is only recently that this technique has been applied for assessingcardiac morphology and physiology. The conversion of fluoroscopic x-raydata into a digital form has an added advantage for the study of thecentral cardiovascular system since it not only permits contrast enhancementof the images but also facilitates quantitative and functional analysisof the x-ray data. The several applications described in this chaptersuggest that digital subtraction cardiovascular angiography will proveto be a powerful tool for studying cardiovascular physiology in animalsand for evaluating heart disease in patients.</TEXT></DOC>
