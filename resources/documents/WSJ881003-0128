Analysts generally believe that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is in position to establish new post-crash highs during October. But they are divided on whether such a move will be anything more than another in a series of attempts by the stock market over the past year to extend its trading range.    In the optimistic camp are those who say the market's period of stability over the past few weeks has laid the groundwork for further improvement. &quot;Maybe what you're getting is a lift in psychology,&quot; says Ralph Acampora, head of technical research at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;It's not close to being euphoric -- people are not all that enthralled about equities -- but at least they feel a little better.&quot;    The Dow Jones industrials reached a post-crash closing high July 5 at 2158.61. Donald Kimsey, senior market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, says the market's ability to hold within &quot;reasonable striking distance&quot; of that high over the past few weeks shows its strength. &quot;There have been ample opportunities for the market to break apart, and it hasn't done so,&quot; he says.    Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear Stearns, expects the market to find buying support near current levels and then go through what he calls &quot;more pedestrian upward progress&quot; beyond its highest levels since last October's market crash.    Similarly, Fredric E. Russell, head of a Tulsa, Okla., money management firm, sees the market moving higher in the fourth quarter as long as the Federal Reserve doesn't take any aggressive steps to boost interest rates. As a result, his firm has cut back on its cash levels and reallocated the funds in stocks. &quot;It's a good setting for some serious investing at this point,&quot; he says.    Mr. Russell suggests that the market looks attractive at current levels from a long-term perspective. &quot;There are no long-term factors that should disturb the ability of corporations to steadily increase production, dividends and earnings over the next few years,&quot; he says. Also, he says, the shock of last October's collapse in stock prices appears to be wearing off among institutions, which are showing more willingness to take an active role in what he calls a &quot;reasonably priced&quot; market based on price-earnings ratios and other yardsticks.    Kidder's Mr. Acampora points out that year-earlier comparisons for stocks will appear increasingly favorable during October, when they will begin to reflect the crash. &quot;People are looking for huge, negative numbers and they're not going to get them. If anything, they're going to get positive numbers,&quot; he says.    The result, he says, should be a gradual improvement in investor psychology over time &quot;as long as we don't take a big hit here.&quot; While he says he hasn't established any major target for the Dow Jones industrials, he too added that the average could establish a new post-crash high quickly.    Still, there remains a fair amount of skepticism about whether the market has the potential to break free of the trading range that has held it in check for nearly a year. Paul Campbell Jr., a technical analyst at Nikko Securities International, says that if the market &quot;does rally in here, I think it's an opportunity to sell stocks on a longer-term basis.&quot;    While he acknowledges the possibility for stocks to advance to post-crash highs shortly, Mr. Campbell believes that technical factors and shifts in the economy are likely to catch up with the market over time and eventually send stocks to lower levels. &quot;There's another shoe to drop&quot; in the aftermath of last October, he says.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Wall Street ended the third quarter on a low note, as the stock market's latest rally ran out of steam near the close and prices finished mixed in moderate trading.    The Dow Jones industrials, which surged 33.78 points last Thursday, fell 6.40 points to 2112.91. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, though. The session left the Dow Jones average with a gain for the week of 22.05 points, or 1.1%.    The market rallied part-way through the trading day on remarks from Indonesia's Subroto, secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He raised the possibility that Saudi Arabia might flood the world oil markets in an effort to pull other OPEC members in line. Such a step would cause lower oil prices and help keep inflation under control.    Stocks reached their session highs at midday, with the Dow Jones industrials up more than 15 points. The market pulled back during the afternoon amid profit-taking, traders said, and then began a fullscale retreat as buying interest evaporated. Big Board volume perked up to 175,750,000 shares from 155,790,000 Thursday.    Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 1 1/2 to 9 1/4; it said it expects to report third-quarter earnings below the $26 million, or 29 cents a share, of the second quarter.    Kroger rose 1 3/8 to 56 3/4 amid speculation that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts will sweeten its takeover bid of $58.50 a share.    Middle South Utilities, which declared a common stock dividend for the first time since July 1985, added 1/2 to 15 in composite trading of 3.3 million shares. </TEXT></DOC>
