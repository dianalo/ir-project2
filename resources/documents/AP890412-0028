The study, Poverty in Rural America: A National Overview, saidmore than one in six people in rural America fell below the federalpoverty line of $9,056 for a family of three in 1987 while the ratewas one in eight for residents of metropolitan areas during thatyear.   ``In fact, the rural poverty rate for 1987 _ the fifth year ofan economic recovery _ was as high as the rate for 1975, thedeepest recession year of the 1970s,'' said Robert Greenstein,director of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, whilepresenting the study Tuesday to a hearing of the House SelectCommittee on Children, Youth and Families.   Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau on poverty from 1978 to1987, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that therural poverty rate rose from 13.5 percent to 16.9 percent.   In metropolitan areas during the same period, the rate rose from10.4 percent to 12.5 percent. Metropolitan areas comprise one ormore cities and their suburbs.   In the central cities, which frequently are associated withpoverty, the rate climbed from 15.4 percent to 18.6 percent,according to the study.   ``What's most striking is that the rate of poverty in ruralareas is almost as high as in central cities,'' Greenstein saidTuesday in an interview.   The center, a nonprofit organization which conducts research andanalysis on a range of public policy issues concerning low-incomefamilies and individuals, found the changes in poverty consistentamong most racial, ethnic, age and demographic groups.   The rural poor are more likely to be white because there is alower proportion of minorities in nonmetropolitan areas, but ``morethan two-fifths (44.1 percent) of nonmetro blacks were poor in1987, compared to one-third (33.3 percent) of blacks living incentral cities.''   There also were more poor elderly people living in rural thanurban areas, the study said.   The only segment of the rural poor that was smaller than itsurban counterpart was children. According to the study, 23.1percent of rural children were poor while 29.6 percent of thechildren in the central cities were poor in 1987.   But one feature that distinguished the rural poor from theirurban counterparts is that rural poverty is likely to occur intwo-parent families where one or both parents work.   ``Nearly two of every three poor families living in rural areascontained at least one worker in 1987,'' the study said. ``Nearlyone quarter had at least two workers.''</TEXT></DOC>
