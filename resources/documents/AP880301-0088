Former hostages Sergio Cominetti, Roberto Diotallevi andGiuseppe Carrara boarded a commercial plane in Iraq on Monday andflew to Amman, Jordan, where they were met by an Italian governmentplane. They landed at the northern Italian airport of Orio al Seriooutside Bergamo.   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that men were in goodcondition on their arrival in Italy and quoted all three asagreeing that they had been treated well in captivity and had neverfeared for their lives.   ``You could call the treatment they gave us humane,'' Carrarawas quoted as saying. ``We were allowed to talk to our captors.Between us a climate of mutual respect was established.''   A group calling itself the Iraqi Kurdish National Union claimedresponsibility for the kidnappings in Iraq last October, demandinga halt to Italian aid to the Iraqi government and removal ofItaly's ships from the Persian Gulf. The kidnappers also made arequest for 2,000 gas masks.   In announcing the release of the hostages, the Italian ForeignMinistry on Saturday said the three were freed because of its``intense and discreet'' efforts, but did not elaborate.   In a telephone interview from Baghdad with the Italian dailyCorriere della Sera on Monday, Diotallevi said Cominetti did notjoin the other two hostages until after they were freed.   Cominetti was taken hostage last September and the other two inOctober while they were working in Iraq on electrical engineeringprojects for two Italian companies.   Carrara said the most dramatic moment was when they were takenhostage. Returning to their headquarters from work, they noticedthey were being followed by a taxi. ``We thought of bandits andtried to escape,'' he said.   Guerrillas fired several times. A splinter from one of thebullets hit Diotallevi, injuring his right eye. During theinterview, Diotallevi added that there were no doctors to treat theinjury and that the eye since has gone blind.   Diotallevi said he and Carrara were held ``in differentrefuges'' in the mountains during their captivity.</TEXT></DOC>
