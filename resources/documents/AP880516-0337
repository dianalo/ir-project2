Monday while a strikedeadline drew closer at Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.   URW and Goodyear representatives were scheduled to meet Tuesdaymorning, hours before the noon deadline for 15,000 workers at 11Goodyear plants. It was not clear Monday how many plants wouldparticipate if a walkout occurred.   The Rubber Workers' policy committee for Goodyear, whichincludes the local presidents from each of the 11 plants, wasscheduled to meet at 8 a.m. with Goodyear officials in Akron, saidURW spokesman Curt Brown.   The union set a strike deadline after Goodyear balked at goingback to the bargaining table in light of worker rejection of atentative contract settlement.   Brown said the policy committee faced a number of options andthat a strike could be averted or postponed depending on Tuesday'smeeting.   ``We still have a few hours until the strike deadline at noonTuesday, and we intend to use the time to see if a strike can beaverted,'' Goodyear said in a statement.   ``Both parties traditionally have been willing to work up to thelast minute to avoid strikes that create hardships for employeesand affect the company's competitive position,'' Goodyear said.``We'll do our best to resolve our differences.''   Although 11 Goodyear plants nationwide were involved in thecontract talks, not all are expected to participate if a walkoutoccurs. Six of the locals have approved the contract, although itwas rejected nationally.   Brown said if a strike is sanctioned by the international union,each local would decide whether to join the walkout.   In Lincoln, Neb., union leaders have already decided Goodyearworkers will stay on the job, according to URW Local 286 VicePresident Lee Domeier. The local's bargaining committee andexecutive board unanimously approved the decision to keep working,he said.   In Akron, members of URW Local 2, which previously approved thecontract by a 3-1 ratio, voted 722-691 in favor of striking onTuesday.   There were no talks scheduled in the contract dispute betweenFirestone and some 4,700 rubber workers.   The union wanted the Goodyear contract to serve as anindustrywide pattern. The union went on strike against Firestone onSunday because Firestone failed to meet the pattern, URW PresidentMilan Stone said.   Firestone officials, however, said their latest offer was``equal in value and in cost'' to the pattern.   The Goodyear contract proposal did not include a pay raise,although there were improvements in cost-of-living allowances, andpension and health insurance benefits.   The third of the nation's Big Three tire makers, UniroyalGoodrich Tire Co., came to terms in mid-April in a contract takinginto account the company's special needs as a result of the recentGoodrich and Uniroyal merger.</TEXT></DOC>
