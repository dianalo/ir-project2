Spurred by the habits of health-obsessed yuppies who go for thatathletically inspired look, variants on the basic sneaker havebecome so with-it that sports shoe manufacturers are rushing tocapitalize on the trend.   Sneakers, frequently less expensive than alternatives, makesense from a practical standpoint even if the wearer isn't fixatedon fitness, shoe stylists say.   ``People are going to wear what's comfortable,'' said KennethCole, owner of a shoe company bearing his name. ``Women arebecoming much more practical than they were in the past.''   Even feet of the well-heeled are shod in canvas. Several widelywatched designers have designated sneakers as the shoes to wearwith their warm weather creations.   Influential designer Donna Karan showed virtually her entirespring and summer DKNY line, including dresses, with sneakers,which retail for about $45 a pair.   Other designers are peddling sneakers with their names on them,including Calvin Klein and Liz Claiborne.   Several arbiters of what's in and what's out have bestowed theirapproval on a more casual approach to attiring feet.   But Ana Luisa Behrens, who tracks shoe fashions for VogueMagazine, doesn't have a completely anything-goes attitude.   ``I prefer to see sneakers during the day. To me it's out of thequestion at night _ unless you are going to a rock concert,'' shesays.``I think that the sneaker has the right moment ... It's notsomething that could be treated like a leather shoe or a suedeshoe.''   Among the main beneficiaries of widersneaker wearing aremanufacturers of athletic shoes.   Converse Inc. has spiced up its All Star collection byintroducing paprika, spinach, crocus and other hues. Wearerswanting to get back to the basics in hi-tops can still select fromthe classic color lineup of white, black, red and navy.   ``We feel we've got to visually merchandise our lines moreaggressively,'' says Stephen Encarnacao, a senior vice president ofNorth Reading, Mass.-based Converse. ``What we've got to do is tomake our All Star not just the classic we all grew up with but tomake it more exciting visually.''   Dealers are giving Converse's refurbishments an enthusiasticreception.   ``They've said, `Gee! Your timing is perfect','' Encarnacao says.   The company's timing coincides with its sneakers and similarones being sported by popular television and film characters.   In the TV show ``The Wonder Years,'' for instance, the maincharacter and his grade-school buddies frequently are seen inhi-tops. Melanie Griffith cavorted in rubber-soled canvas as thestar of the movie ``Working Girl.''   Converse, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Interco Inc., hopes towow sneaker wearers with its Batman line of hi-tops for adults.   Full-scale distribution of the novelty shoes, one model dottedwith the Batman yellow and black logo and another featuringBatman's arch enemy, the Joker, is timed to coincide with the lateJune release of the movie ``Batman,'' starring Michael Keaton asthe masked hero and Jack Nicholson as the Joker.   Once known as the maker of little white canvas sneakers andchild-sized rubber-toe-capped red models, Keds Corp. has beenadding to its repertoire for several years and trying to enlivenits image.   This year, it is pitching offerings on primetime networktelevision, marking the first such advertising campaign for Kedsthis decade. The commercials are designed for a broad audience,specifically intended to tweak teenagers' interest while stillappealing to women 25- to 45-years old.   Barbara Scott, director of marketing for Keds, based inCambridge, Mass. and a division of Stride Rite Corp., says a keychange has been an expansion of colors available at any one time.This season bright ones _ fuchsia, peacock-like blue, vivid green _seem to be the rage. Pastel tints still have a following amongKeds' fanciers, Scott says.   Keds also is introducing a walking shoe in the autumn and hasexpanded into leather lines.   The changes are paying off for Keds. Gross sales are expected toreach $200 million in 1989, a four-fold increase from 1985's $50million.   The undisputed champ in the athletic-leisure segment of the shoemarket is Reebok International Ltd.   In the way Sanka has become a synomym for decaffeinated coffee,the name Reebok is becoming a generic term for a shoe favored byweekend warriors _ people who want to look like they work out allthe time but probably only do so on weekends, not serious athletes.   That's not to say the company hasn't carved a slice of thehigh-performance shoe market, an area which Beaverton, Ore.-basedNike Inc. currently dominates. Reebok's strong sales, plus thecompany's determination to get inventories down to more manageablelevels after an excessive expansion last year, has significantlyshrunken supplies of Reeboks this spring.   ``I don't think there's any dramatic shortage out there,'' saidPaul R. Duncan, chief financial officer of the companyheadquartered in Canton, Mass. ``It's not a big deal as long as itgets resolved in a few months. There's no shortage and there'scertainly no real excess either.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, May 14</NOTE></DOC>
