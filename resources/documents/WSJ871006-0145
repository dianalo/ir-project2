SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SPCBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's no accident that David Lovejoy, Security Pacific Corp.'s investment-banking chief, sits nearest Chairman Richard Flamson on the 54th floor of the headquarters here.    Since 1982, Security Pacific has spent $300 million expanding into investment banking, a huge gamble for what had been solely a regional commercial bank. The costs, and risks, make Mr. Flamson a little nervous. &quot;By God,&quot; he exclaims, &quot;we've spent fortunes on trading facilities and that kind of thing.&quot; So, a former executive says, Mr. Flamson &quot;wants to keep an eye&quot; on Mr. Lovejoy. &quot;David holds the keys to the vault.&quot;    More than any similar banking company, Security Pacific has gone on a diversification binge. Last year, about a third of its net income came from a hodgepodge of 22 companies purveying nonbank financial services, such as insurance and discount securities brokerage. Much of the rest came from investment banking, including a global securities network based in London and a New York trading operation that is selling other companies' debt at an astounding rate of $250 billion a year.    The strategy is an offbeat as well as risky attempt to solve big-league commercial banking's central problem: the decline of lending to top-rated corporations and other former big borrowers, which now often tap the capital markets directly for funds. So far, the diversification outside traditional commercial banking has helped Security Pacific chalk up 12 consecutive years of record earnings.    &quot;Obviously, the business is riskier, but they know the risks and don't stick their necks out,&quot; says Lloyd Johnson, the chief executive of Norwest Corp., a large Minneapolis-based regional bank, and a former Security Pacific manager. &quot;Establishing a lot of income sources is crucial.&quot;    But most big regional banks, in contrast, are generally sailing on the opposite tack. Institutions such as Banc One Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh and First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., are increasing earnings by pushing consumer and small-business loans, acquiring other banks and cutting costs. They expect to earn more consistent profits, while Security Pacific may face a future of roller-coaster earnings.    &quot;The big question,&quot; says a financial executive friendly with Mr. Flamson, &quot;is whether all of this movement and development is sustainable and controllable. It is unbelievable to be doing all of this at once.&quot; J. Richard Fredericks, a bank analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, considers Security Pacific &quot;almost accident-prone.&quot;    Accidents befell Security Pacific in the 1987 first half: Glitches in just two volatile financial markets battered its return on assets. It has also paid the huge costs of entering other markets and acquiring companies, including five out-of-state banks for $1.7 billion in the past 12 months.    The pressure to keep quarterly earnings rising has turned Mr. Flamson into something of a magician who repeatedly has to pull a rabbit out of his hat. Security Pacific's 20% jump in 1986 earnings, for instance, was aided by one-time profits from the sale of two subsidiaries, of some venture-capital investments and of some other securities holdings. In the 1987 first half, gains on venture capital and securities fell sharply. So did the return on assets, not counting a big loss for adding to foreign-loan reserves.    But Security Pacific's top managers see such maneuvering as a sign of strength rather than weakness. The investment-banking operation is restoring access to many former customers, but as a broker and underwriter rather than lender. The managers also believe that they are in so many promising financial markets that their hot products usually will more than offset their losers. &quot;We have developed a kind of controlled adventurism around here,&quot; Mr. Lovejoy says.    Unlike many of the nation's top 10 banks -- it currently ranks seventh in assets -- Security Pacific expects a profit this year despite a $500 million second-quarter charge from adding to foreign-loan reserves. And with some major investments completed, the company is optimistic about future earnings.    &quot;We are building the premier financial institution on the West Coast,&quot; Mr. Flamson says. &quot;What we are going to do now is to stop writing big checks and prove to the world that we have a higher earnings plateau in front of us.&quot;    If its maverick strategy works, Security Pacific will be showing another way, besides acquisitions, for superregional banks to grow. These banks' managers, including Mr. Flamson, plan to eventually challenge the big New York banks as national giants in their own right. Bolstered by strong equity-capital positions, superregionals already are growing faster than money-center institutions.    Security Pacific's future also will depend heavily on an equally maverick management style -- an aggressiveness that sometimes strikes other bankers as hostility, an ingenuity that sometimes bends regulations and an obsession with elaborate risk controls.    The style is set by Mr. Flamson, a 58-year-old former Army officer who started at Security Pacific as a car repossessor after the Korean War. He has raised hackles by being the first major banker to admit openly the need for reserves against Third World debt. And he publicly rebuked his Los Angeles rival, First Interstate Bancorp, for its recent attempt to take over another competitor, BankAmerica Corp.    Inside his own shop, Mr. Flamson fosters a team approach to decision making, and sometimes his weekly sessions with top aides turn into shouting matches. Punctuating points with profanities, he flashes a quick temper. &quot;But the good thing about Dick,&quot; a former manager says, &quot;is that all is forgotten the next day.&quot; Privately freewheeling, he has been known, for laughs, to impersonate a camel trader or refrigerator repairman in telephone calls to aides.    Mr. Flamson hasn't hesitated to recruit outside specialists to run his nonbank operations. In fact, some close aides openly disdain bankers. The root cause of a big jump in loan losses at the auto-finance unit last year? &quot;We had a bunch of bankers running it,&quot; growls William Ford, a former General Electric Co. official who is the financial-services chief. He brought in experts from Detroit for a repair job.    New managers have been needed since the late 1970s, when Security Pacific cautiously began buying small financial-services concerns. The discount-brokerage operation began five years ago with one office and six employees; it now has 17 offices and 131 employees. The consumer-finance unit was launched by a lone new hire; it now operates offices in 40 states, Europe and Asia. The leasing unit generated &quot;no huge portfolio or personnel empire, just a decent profit,&quot; says D.E. Mundell, the president of U.S. Leasing International, itself a leasing giant. &quot;They didn't do things out of proportion.&quot;    Until recently, the foray into diverse financial services has been a winner. It brought a 1.78% return on assets in 1985, nearly double the return of the California-banking and real-estate-lending group.    Beginning in 1982, however, Mr. Flamson began expanding in earnest, into securities trading, foreign-exchange dealing and loan brokering. Security Pacific spent $100 million to acquire control of London-based Hoare Govett Ltd., instantly establishing a global securities network. It spent an estimated $110 million to $140 million for capital-markets staff, product and market development, and $60 million to $70 million for high-tech trading rooms around the world.    The size and the speed of the plunge into capital markets are unusual for an institution based outside New York. Security Pacific started an interest-rate swap operation overnight by raiding First Chicago Corp.'s four-person team. Similarly, Security Pacific launched its loan-selling unit with a bang. In 1986, its first year, the unit sold $90 billion of loans -- mostly short-term corporate financing but including some corporate buy-outs. This year, the operation, based in New York, expects to sell $250 billion more -- trailing only Citicorp and Bankers Trust in volume.    &quot;I can assure you Citicorp didn't worry about Security Pacific&quot; two years ago, says Alexander McFerran, the loan-sale chief and a Citicorp alumnus. But now, he says, the New York bank is &quot;beginning to see us as a formidable competitor.&quot;    Security Pacific has scored two other coups in the capital markets. It acquired Hoare Govett -- apparently for a song -- before financial deregulation in London triggered a bidding war for stockbrokers there. Thanks mostly to Hoare Govett's brokerage operations, international fee income climbed 114% in the first half to $66.4 million. And in bond and other securities trading, Security Pacific's first-half profit surged nearly sixfold from a year earlier to $88.9 million, while other commercial and investment banks posted flat earnings or large losses because of an unexpected jump in long-term interest rates in April.    The company takes unusual pains to monitor risks. In a university-like setting in Jersey City, for instance, 80 mathematicians develop formulas to keep traders across the Hudson River in Manhattan from dropping millions of dollars at the blink of a computer screen. The unit, Financial Strategies Inc., wires a top-secret &quot;corporate risk profile&quot; to Los Angeles headquarters each morning. Fittingly, a computer-printed banner dubs one corner of its offices the &quot;Can-Do Cubicle.&quot;    The can-do attitude extends to federal regulations. Outraging competitors, Security Pacific has tried hard to circumvent rules limiting what banks can do. It was a pioneer at underwriting mortgage-backed securities, and it now wants to become the first major bank to operate a government-securities-options exchange. Securities and options groups have gone to court, contending that the new activities would tread illegally on their turf.    Security Pacific also routinely sidesteps a Federal Reserve rule limiting overseas stock underwritings to $2 million per issue. Its Hoare Govett unit syndicates such offerings among its institutional clients, giving up some of the underwriting fees but holding Security Pacific's risk to no more than the Fed limit. Thus, Security Pacific recently sold $200 million in common stock for Hillsdown Holdings PLC, a British conglomerate. &quot;Slightly larger than $2 million,&quot; wryly notes Dean Lundell, a Security Pacific official in London.    Critics see potential problems, such as investor lawsuits if some of the loans sold by Security Pacific go bad. More and more of the loans involve riskier leveraged buy-outs, and hundreds of millions of dollars of credit is now routinely committed on a few hours' notice. The company syndicated the recent leveraged buy-out of Charles Schwab Corp. from BankAmerica, even though, according to a Schwab official, most competitors &quot;just said no.&quot;    Credit losses have jumped threefold since 1982. Its problems included bad loans to Petro-Lewis Corp., a Denver-based oil company behind one of the costliest investor debacles on record, and Technical Equities Corp., a West Coast investment firm that collapsed last year amid allegations of fraud.    Also hurting Security Pacific are its high costs. Several of Mr. Lovejoy's specialists were paid more than he was last year (the bank won't disclose his pay). In the first half, total non-interest costs jumped 30% -- by nearly $300 million -- after a 20% rise in 1986. By comparison, first-half non-interest income grew just $197 million. And acquisition costs have been high. Despite sharp cuts in expenses, Security Pacific's $1.1 billion acquisition early this year of Rainier Bancorp., of Seattle, is expected to reduce earnings per share for at least two years.    But Robert Smith, Mr. Flamson's heir apparent and once a force behind the investment-banking push, has a plan for the company's flagship California bank. Since April, Mr. Smith has disbanded a longstanding management-trainee program and shelved a futuristic $50 million branch computerization. He also has lifted the caps off incentive pay and assembled a team of loan officers to call on consumer and business customers.    In addition, some former managers expect 2,000 jobs to be cut. Mr. Smith denies that there will be that many but vows to treat his bankers with &quot;a much bigger carrot and a much bigger stick.&quot; But one furloughed official who has already felt the stick says, &quot;They are tossing people out like tissue paper.&quot;    ---             Security Pacific -- By the Numbers    Headquarters: Los Angeles   Market: NYSE    -------------------------------------------------------    Analysts' earnings per share forecast:                                   1987 $1.38   1988 $5.52                       12/86   12/85   12/84   12/83   12/82 Operations (in millions) Pretax income         $499.3  $494.3  $456.4  $452.7  $351.8 Net income            $385.9  $322.8  $291.0  $264.3  $234.3 Per share Earnings              $4.86   $4.35   $3.96   $3.61   $3.27 Common dividend       $1.445  $1.31   $1.195  $1.09   $0.98 Closing stock price  $34.625 $31.875 $25.75  $25.50  $15.50 Balance sheet (in millions) Total assets         $62,606 $53,505 $46,117 $40,382 $36,99 Return on average assets Security Pacific       0.71%   0.69%   0.71%   0.71%   0.67% California bank's avg  0.52%   0.55%   0.67%   0.65%   0.63% Full-time employees   32,520  30,538  28,613  27,527  27,058    Sources: Company reports; E.F.
