Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman,whose agency is in charge of disposing of bankrupt thrifts, toldthe Senate Banking Committee it is much too early to reliablypredict the cost of the bailout.   But, he said, ``it is possible that $50 billion will prove to bean insufficient amount to deal with potential failures.''   His comments, included in written testimony to the panel, whichis taking Congress' first look at the bailout since it was enactedAug. 9, are the strongest yet from a government official. Privateanalysts have been saying for months that the $50 billion likelywill prove to be only a down payment.   Seidman said the Resolution Trust Corp., operated by the FDIC todispose of failed Sandamp;Ls, expects losses on the 283 seized byregulators so far to total $35 billion.   By the time the bailout ends in August 1992, regulators may haveseized as many as 300 more dead Sandamp;Ls, bringing the total to nearly600, he said. Those projections ``raise questions about theadequacy of the $50 billion in RTC funding.''   However, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who heads anadministration board overseeing the RTC's performance, said ``Iknow of nothing that's occurred since the bill passed to change mymind'' that $50 billion likely is sufficient.   That ``isn't the point. Maybe we need 52, maybe we need 48. Thepoint is we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the pointwhere it's embers,'' Brady said.   Seidman, answering questions from senators, softened his tone abit, emphasizing the impossibility of making a certain lossestimate. Nevertheless, he said, ``there's no way we can say forsure that $50 billion is enough.''   On a related matter, he said the RTC may have to borrow $25billion or more, in addition to the $50 billion, to provide workingcash until it can recover money by selling loans and real estateonce owned by failed Sandamp;Ls.   Congress authorized the extra borrowing, but Sen. Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the banking committee, said $25billion was far more than envisioned.   So far, the RTC has run through $20 billion: $1.8 billion toclose 24 small Sandamp;Ls, $8.3 billion to handle five large institutionsby next week and five smaller not-yet-completed deals, $8.5 billionto replace high-cost deposits and $1.4 billion as a reserve fund tohandle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are stillopen, Seidman said.   Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson said the inability toclose the five big cases by Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1989,means the reported federal budget deficit will be about $8 billionhigher in fiscal 1990.   However, he said that would not trigger automatic spending cutsunder the Gramm-Rudman law. The 1990 budget estimate taken fordetermining those cuts was made on Aug. 15, he said.   Meanwhile, both Brady and Seidman reassured committee members,alarmed by the scandal at the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, that they are working to prevent similar abuses fromdeveloping at the RTC.   ``I think we've learned from the mistakes of the past,'' addedHousing Secretary Jack Kemp, a member of Brady's oversight panel.   Seidman said the RTC last week issued an interim ethics codegoverning the thousands of independent contractors it is expectedto hire to manage the real estate and other assets it is inheritingfrom the thrifts.   Both Brady and Seidman said the RTC and the oversight panelchaired by Brady were working well together despite initialtensions.   ``No joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthyfrictions, and ours is no exception,'' Brady said. ``But overall wehave gotten off to an excellent start.''   At a separate hearing held by a 17-member House Banking taskforce, Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., complained about RTC projectionsthat it would swell from 1,150 employees currently to between 5,000and 10,000.   ``No one intended this legislation to create a big bureaucracy.... (That's) the last thing in the world I want,'' he said.   RTC Executive Director David C. Cooke said his agency likelywill handle in excess of $300 billion assets, about a third of thatdifficult to sell. If the RTC eventually has as many as 10,000employees, that's only one employee managing every $10 million inassets, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
