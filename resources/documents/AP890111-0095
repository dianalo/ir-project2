(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   University of Oklahoma officials have purgedlibrary computers of a virus that ruined several students' papersand shut down terminals and printers in a student computer lab.   The library also has set up extra computers at its computer labentrance to inspect students' programs for viruses before they areused on other computers, said Bizzell Memorial Library managerDonald Hudson.   A computer virus is a program that, once inside a computer,duplicates itself. A virus can tell computers to put a message on ascreen or shut down at a certain time or just replicate itself untilthe computer overloads.   The library's virus probably got into a computer through astudent's disk, but the student may not have known the virus wasthere, Hudson said. The library's computers are not linked to anycomputer off-campus.   The computers used in the student lab are connected throughprinters, which allowed the virus to spread, Hudson said.</TEXT></DOC>
