(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Auto Workers union andCaterpillar Inc. have reached a contract accord on all issuesexcept those to be addressed by the union at the local level, chiefUAW negotiator Bill Casstevens said late Thursday.   Casstevens said the union will strike, however, unlessCaterpillar meets with UAW locals and settles their issues by 11p.m. Friday.   ``The issues that remain that separate us are issues that we sayare local in nature,'' said Casstevens, secretary-treasurer of theUAW International. ``The company disagrees with us.''   Casstevens said the locals would be authorized to ``takewhatever action they deemed necessary,'' including a strike, if thedeadline was not met.   A spokesman for Caterpillar was not immediately available forcomment.   Casstevens confirmed that one of the main issues stillseparating the two sides was contract provisions concerning specialjob classifications, which restrict workers from transferringbetween jobs within the company.   ``We are saying we have an understanding on the central itemsthat we could recommend to the membership. The items that separateus are items that we say are local in nature and have to beresolved on the local table,'' Casstevens said.   He said he hoped the company would resume talks on the locallevel.   ``We're sending them back to the local table,'' Casstevens said.``We hope they'll talk. You can't resolve it without doing that.''   The local unions that reportedly have not reached localagreements with the company include East Peoria, Aurora andDecatur, Ill.   Jerry Brown, bargaining chairman of Local 974 of Peoria, saidthe local was prepared to strike. He said it had given the companya proposal Tuesday and was waiting for a response.   Brown said the union would not to grant an extension on itslocal talks. He said the union had considered the economicconsequences of staging a walkout, but added that the union mightnot have a choice.   ``We don't take a strike lightly and we didn't come down here tobargain for a strike, but we're not going to roll over and playdead either,'' he said.   Local members consider the job classification issue to beimportant because it went against the basic idea of a senoritysystem and would allow some workers to be laid off before workerswith less senority, Brown said.   He didnt rule out the possibility of a settlement before thedeadline and again urged the membership to continue reporting forwork until instructed otherwise.</TEXT></DOC>
