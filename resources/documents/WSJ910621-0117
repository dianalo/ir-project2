General Motors of Canada Ltd., the only military armoredvehicle manufacturer within the GM group, has a Saudicontract for 393 light armored vehicles and is &quot;close&quot; to anew Saudi contract for a further 1,117 vehicles. The twoorders are valued at about 1.5 billion Canadian dollars(US$1.31 billion), a GM Canada spokesman said.</LP><TEXT>   The Saudi sales have been jeopardized by a provision ofthe Canadian criminal code restricting the production andsale of automatic small arms weapons. The light armoredvehicles are equipped with such a weapon, a 25-mm cannon.   The proposed legislation would allow exports of automaticfirearms to specified countries, including Saudi Arabia. Thelegislation was approved by the House of Commons Wednesdayand the upper chamber of Parliament, the Senate, is expectedto pass the bill today.   GM executives say the light armored vehicle has strongsales prospects. &quot;Armies are now turning away from heavymechanized forces to lighter, rapidly deployable forces andpeacekeeping forces for which our vehicle is ideally suited,&quot;said W.J. Pettipas, a GM Canada executive.   &quot;Our biggest potential is with the U.S. Army NationalGuard and the U.S. Army,&quot; he said. The National Guard intendsto test the eight-wheel vehicles for anti-drug borderpatrols, equipping them with surveillance devices.   GM Canada has received orders from the U.S. Marines andthe Canadian armed forces for more than 1,460 light armoredvehicles. Deliveries are now being made to the Canadian armedforces on the latest Canadian order for 199. The vehicles,which are mostly used for transporting troops acrossbattlefields, are built under license from Mowag AG ofSwitzerland.   The GM spokesman said the expected new Saudi order wouldamount to about seven years of work, at current productionrates, at the military production facilities of GM Canada'sdiesel division, which is based in London, Ontario. About athird of the division's 2,200 workers are involved inmilitary work. The division's biggest activity is productionof diesel locomotives.   &quot;Our future now looks very promising,&quot; Mr. Pettipas toldmembers of Parliament.   Relaxation of the weapons sales restrictions was alsourged by Diemaco Inc., a small arms manufacturing subsidiaryof Toronto-based Devtek Corp. Diemaco, which is based inKitchener, Ontario, is competing for a C$120 million contractto supply automatic weapons to the Dutch armed forces. &quot;Weare in an excellent position to win this contract,&quot; JamesRenner, Devtek's president, said.</TEXT></DOC>
