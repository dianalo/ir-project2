(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge on Friday gave custody of anorphaned toddler Friday to his mother's longtime female companion,rather than the boy's blood relatives.   ``I have been co-parenting Collin,'' Susan Bellemare, 33, told aVermont probate judge as she fought to win custody of the15-month-old. ``I would parent the child, I would love him, nurturehim.''   Bellemare was named guardian of Collin Hamilton in the will ofSusan Hamilton, who died in a car accident in May. Hamilton'sparents are challenging the will, claiming they or Hamilton'ssister, Kathleen, would be a better guardian.   No one involved in the case would characterize the relationshipof the two women, who owned a home together and reportedly exchangedwedding rings. They were companions for a dozen years and livedtogether while raising the baby, who was conceived by artificialinsemination.   ``We're not trying to cast aspersions on anybody,'' said PatrickMonaghan Jr., lawyer for the grandparents, Philip and Elsa Hamiltonof Montvale, N.J. ``The person forgotten in this proceeding is thechild and what is in the best interests of the child.''   The grandparents attended Friday's hearing, but did not testify.Susan Hamilton's brother, Tom, called the decision disgusting.``This other Susan, she is not even blood,'' he said.   Judge L. John Cain awarded temporary custody to Bellemare,allowing the grandparents visitation rights, after asking Bellemareabout her health and her ability to raise the child on her own.   Bellemare, who was injured in the accident that killed Hamilton,used a cane to walk to the witness stand. She said she saw a doctortwo weeks ago who told her ``to get on with my life.''   ``I'm back at work, I'm driving,'' said Bellemare, a nurse. ``I'mback at home and able to provide for the child.''   Bellemare, Hamilton and the baby were returning from a weekendtrip in May when their car was struck by a truck.   Another hearing was set for August. Attorneys representing theboy's grandparents would not say whether they planned to appeal thejudge's temporary custody order.   Still to be determined is whether the will is valid, and thuswhether Bellemare is the legal guardian. If the will is accepted,Cain said later, the grandparents would then have to petition theprobate court if they wanted to set aside the guardianship.</TEXT></DOC>
