(products).andO;Ticker:    TEK.andO;Product:   Tektronix ColorQuick (Computer printer).andO;Topic:     Ink-Jet PrintersColorEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fast, Top-Quality PrinterandM;TEKTRONIX INC.andP;  COLORQUICK, $2,345;andM;MACINTOSH ACCESSORY KIT, $150andM;The ColorQuick is based on the same Sharp ink-jet printer engine as Sharp'sJX-730, meaning that users install ink and maintenance cartridges the sameway they do with Sharp's machine.andM;Tektronix has redesigned the printhead to provide a resolution of 216 dpi,which is exactly three times the resolution of the Macintosh screen.andP;  Thisallows it, in conjunction with the supplied fonts, to do an excellent job ofreproducing text and graphics.andM;The printer comes with SCSI and Centronics interfaces, plus an automaticcut-sheet feeder capable of holding 100 sheets of paper.andM;Paper may also be fed via a roll, manually or with an optional tractor feed.andO;The ColorQuick supports paper sizes of 8.5 by 11, 8.5 by 14 and 11 by 17inches, or roll transparencies.andM;The front panel has indicators for each of the four ink tanks and themaintenance cartridge, plus the standard on-line, form-feed and line-feedcontrols.andM;The documentation is excellent -- it is clearly written with numerousdrawings, cautions and tips, and includes an entire section ontroubleshooting.andP;  It covers everything fully, from setup, to using theMacintosh software, to periodic maintenance.andM;The ColorQuick printer requires a Macintosh II with at least 2M bytes ofmemory.andM;The printer driver has two resolution levels: 72 dpi for bit-mapped graphicssuch as Pixel Paint and MacPaint, and 216 dpi for text or vector graphicspackages such as PageMaker or MacDraw.andM;All of the test pictures printed showed rich colors that were mostlyconsistent with the color on the screen.andP;  In graphics mode, text wasextremely sharp and clear at all sizes.andM;The Microsoft Word test document printed with comparable quality to thatobtained from good near-letter-quality dot-matrix printers.andM;Even on complicated drawings, this printer was the fastest of the threetested.andP;  In addition, only the ColorQuick was able to print an intentionallyfaded graphic image.andM;Tektronix now ships an application with the ColorQuick called Tekcolor.andP;  Thisallows the screen and printer to be calibrated so that the print output moreexactly matches the colors on the screen.andM;The ColorQuick's speed and its superior graphics and text output make thisprinter an excellent choice.andM;Tektronix is located in Wilsonville, Ore., and can be reached at (800)835-6100.andM;----------Buyers say: Strong supportandM;Buyers were generally pleased with the ColorQuick's performance and praisedTektronix's technical support.andM;Carl Mire, sales representative and technical staff member at CompServCo, asoftware developer and reseller in Slidell, La., said, &quot;The text comes outvery nice.andP;  I'd say it's between a dot-matrix and a LaserWriter as far asoutput quality goes.andM;&quot;We use a graphics program called Planet [from ICADS International].andP;  It's aprogram that lets you see kitchens in 3-D, and the [printer] does a real nicejob with it.&quot;andM;It is easy to refill the printer's ink tanks, Mire commented.andM;He was also impressed by how quietly the ColorQuick works.andP;  &quot;It's a veryquiet printer.andP;  That's a big plus,&quot; Mire said.andP;  &quot;The other solution for uswould've been to go to a plotter -- that's a loud printer, especially whenyou have it in the office, with people on the phone.&quot;andM;John Varney, owner of Ketek Inc., which manufactures machines used to produceLCDs, in Coral Springs, Fla., said he has depended heavily on Tektronix'stechnical support staff.andM;&quot;When I first got the printer it worked fine,&quot; Varney said.andP;  &quot;Then after ashort time I had a problem with it, and it wouldn't print.andP;  I contacted[Tektronox's] technical people, and they were anxious to take care of myproblem.&quot;andM;Tektronix immediately dispatched a technician, who diagnosed the problem as afaulty head, he said.andP;  &quot;They've replaced it three times since then,&quot; saidVarney.andM;&quot;Right now it's working fine.andP;  I would've normally gone to another company,but the people at Tektronix are helpful and genuinely concerned about myproblems.&quot;andM;&quot;I've used their tech support, and they've always been prompt and thorough,&quot;agreed Mire.andM;----------Reviews by Garry Frenkel; interviews by Michael Zimmerman; edited by DougChandler and Steve WebsterandM;Both color and black-and-white ink-jet printers work by propelling tinydroplets of ink through small holes in a print head onto media.andP;  Either thecontinuous-spray or the drop-on-demand method can be used.andM;The drop-on-demand technique used by the printers in this review employselectronically pulsed transducers to propel the ink only when a drop isneeded.andP;  This method is more reliable than the continuous-spray method, whichshoots a continuous stream of ink while using a magnetic field to deflect thedrops from areas where they are not needed.andM;The four colors of ink -- black, magenta, cyan and yellow -- are blended by aprocess called dithering, which creates a variety of colors and halftones.andO;The quality of these colors and halftones is controlled by the ditheringalgorithms contained in the printer's driver.andM;In their earlier days, ink-jet printers suffered from clogged nozzles andsmeared ink, but developments in both the ink and paper quality have resolvedthese problems.andM;Although ink-jet printers can print on any type of paper, specially coatedink-jet paper yields the best color quality.andM;The Tektronix Inc. and Sharp Electronics Corp. devices have separate inktanks for each color.andP;  This is preferable to the single, multiple-colorcartridge used by Hewlett-Packard Co.'s printer.andP;  With Hewlett-Packard'sdevice, if one color is used predominantly (as in printing backgrounds) andthat ink runs out, users must replace the entire cartridge even though othercolors may not have been used up.andP;
