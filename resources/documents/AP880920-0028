The Sejm, or parliament, voted 359-1 with 17 abstentions Mondayto accept the resignation of Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner andall 19 ministers in his government, which had been sharplycriticized for its handling of the economy.   In free-wheeling debate that preceded the vote, one deputysuggested inviting opposition members into whatever governing teamis named. Another urged reinstatement of the outlawed Solidarityfree trade union movement.   Inflation that has reached 60 percent helped provoke a wave oflabor unrest in the spring and a second round of strikes last monththat ended when communist authorities agreed to talks with theopposition that may include the issue of legalizing Solidarity.   Scheduled for next month, the talks are to focus on the solvingcountry's daunting economic and social problems.   The current Cabinet is to remain in place until the Sejm names anew government, which it is expected to do later in the month.   ``We are looking for someone who is competent, someone who hasimagination and charisma,'' said Alfred Miodowicz, a member of thecommunist party's ruling Politburo and leader of the official tradeunion federation OPZZ.   In Poland, the communist party holds ultimate power, appointsthe government and mandates policy.   Krystyna Jandy-Jendroska, chairwoman of a Sejm committee thatcriticized the economic performance of Messner's government, saidin her report to parliament that more ``coalition forces'' fromoutside the party should be brought into government, includingexperts on the economy.   Polish United Workers (communist) Party deputy RyszardLukasiewicz, a Warsaw journalist, urged a system of ``socialistparliamentary democracy''.   ``Different social groups, including the opposition, must assumeparticipation within the authorities,'' he said. ``It would meansignificant changes in the model of the party's leadership (and)working out a model of a ruling coalition.''   The comments appeared in line with statements from authoritiesin recent months that the government should broaden its base ofsupport.   Fifteen of the resigning government's 19 ministers arecommunists, two have no party affiliation, and there is oneminister each from the communist-allied Peasant Party andDemocratic Party.   The topic of Solidarity and its chairman Lech Walesa came upseveral times in the discussion that followed Messner'sannouncement of the resignations.   Solidarity ``should regain its proper place in the trade unionmovement,'' said Ryszard Bender, an independent parliament memberfrom Lublin. It was the first call in parliament for legalizingSolidarity since the movement was suppressed with a 1981 militarycrackdown.   Addressing Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Bender saidJaruzelski and Walesa, ``the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate inPolish history,'' should meet and make a joint statement concerningPoland's ``most vital interests.''   Jaruzelski smiled slightly but did not otherwise react.   In all, about 30 deputies spoke, with several endorsing theplanned broad-based talks that are to include the opposition.   At least speaker suggested the government was being used as awhipping boy.   ``The situation resembles a soccer game,'' said Tomasz Adamczuk,a Peasant Party member. ``The players are the political parties,the Polish trade union alliance, the opposition and others,'' hesaid. ``The ball is the government.''</TEXT></DOC>
