It is the gateway to the coastal highway that runs fromIraq to many Saudi oil fields. Just six miles to the north isthe border with Kuwait. According to Saudi officials, theIraqi military buildup now totals 170,000 men in the occupiedemirate and continues to grow daily. Any defense against aninvasion of Saudi Arabia must begin here.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are not looking for a war, but if they start, we areready for one,&quot; said Prince Khalid Al Otaishan, the emir, orgovernor, of this coastal province.   Outside his office, there is a room full of turbaned men,some of whom balance assault rifles on their knees. In afield behind the building, several armored vehicles areparked in a rare spot of shade.   Other than that, however, there is little to indicate amilitary crisis, because both the Iraqis and the American andallied forces arrayed against them appear to be trying toplay down the growth in their forces.   U.S. troops, which have continued to pour into Saudi basesfurther south, are taking care not to be obvious about theirpresence. During a long drive up the coastal road, reporterssaw only a few jeeps, two light tanks, some helicopters, andtwo busloads of troops to indicate that Marines andparatroopers are patrolling the oilfields.   According to Saudi officials, who asked not to beidentified, the Iraqis appear to be following a similarpolicy. Their main forces are at least 25 miles from theKuwaiti border, holding what appears to be a defensiveposition in a broad crescent-shaped formation around the cityof Kuwait. And they have established a major command postsouth of the city.   &quot;There is a lot of tension in the air,&quot; said Albert Skiba,an employee of a U.S. oil-service company, as he finishedlunch at a beachfront hotel here.   The hotel is full and the town is beginning to fill upagain, according to the prince. Some of the city's residentsfled after Iraq invaded Kuwait, but now, bolstered by thepresence of Saudi troops and the knowledge that Americantroops and warships are nearby, they are returning, he said.   Some Kuwaitis, including Capt. Mohammed Al Ajmi of theKuwait air force have come to the border area after initiallyfleeing farther south with his family. He said that's becausehe can use his car phone to call relatives in Kuwait, wherehe says there is growing guerrilla resistance to the Iraqioccupiers.   Saudi officals say they have heard of two cases in whichKuwaitis have bribed Iraqi crews to abandon their tanks andthen blew them up. Capt. Al Ajmi says he has heard of a casewhere Kuwaitis used a car bomb to blow up an Iraqi commandpost in Kuwait.   One worry that Saudi officials here have is that the lullthat has settled over this town could end quickly.   Moreover, one official noted, there are an additional85,000 Iraqi troops just north of Kuwait in Iraq. Thousandsmore are believed to be moving south from Iraq's border withIran -- a result of Iraq's peacemaking overtures to itsformer enemy.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, touring the Middle East,told U.S. troops that the Pentagon's latest estimates arethat Saddam Hussein's army has moved &quot;over 200,000 men&quot; intoKuwait and southern Iraq, along with &quot;well over 1,000 tanks.&quot;   At the same time, a senior Pentagon official travelingwith Mr. Cheney indicated that the U.S. buildup wouldcontinue until at least 60,000 fighting troops and another40,000 or so supporting soldiers have arrived in the region.&quot;We will stop only when the president says enough, andthere's no sign of that yet,&quot; the official said.   Moreover, Mr. Cheney is expected to lay the groundwork forpotential sales of military equipment to Oman and the UnitedArab Emirates when he meets with leaders of those countriestoday. And a senior Bahrain official said that the PersianGulf kingdom would be willing to make bases available to theU.S. if it became necessary to counter Iraqi threats.   Prince Al Otaishan, 41, who has a master's degree from theUniversity of Southern California, says he is glad to havethe U.S. assistance. However, he says, he has announcedcontingency plans to evacuate residents to a tent city in thedesert should shooting start.   &quot;You have to protect people. You just can't leave themhere.&quot; he said.   Mursi Abubakr, son of the owner of the beachfront hotel,said he hasn't heard of any official evacuation plans andcan't conceive of leaving. &quot;You just can't leave this,&quot; hesaid, referring to the business.   &quot;We called the {U.S.} embassy,&quot; said Scott Scheid, anotheroil-field service company employee, &quot;and they said they wouldcall if there is a problem.&quot;   One problem would be if the production here from theJapanese-owned Arabian Oil Co., whose fields produce 300,000barrels of oil a day, were lost to the West.   In a briefing given to U.S. reporters over the weekend,Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said the combinedproduction loss from Kuwait and Iraq would amount to &quot;wellover&quot; four million barrels a day. The Saudi government, hesaid, isn't sure how much of that could be made up by othersources because it doesn't know the actual productioncapacity of some of the other members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries.   Departing from the usual diplomatic rhetoric used by theSaudis, he said his government was demanding that OPEC meet&quot;immediately&quot; to plan how to help resolve the crisis.Otherwise, he said, Saudi Arabia will begin to pump an extratwo million barrels a day by itself.   &quot;We don't see how an organization can turn away its faceand say there is no crisis. All they have to do is go toKuwait and they will find one,&quot; he said. Indonesia andseveral other members of OPEC have indicated that they arenot yet ready for such a meeting.   Saudi officials say that it may take a while for the pinchof the international embargo to be felt by Iraq's military.&quot;They are extremely well-stocked with spare parts andmunitions,&quot; one said.</TEXT></DOC>
