Such use of solar energycan be achieved by designing houses to minimize heat losses and to beproperly oriented, making maximum use of landscape features. In addition,passive and active solar heating systems can be installed for space heating,hot water heating, and swimming pool heating. 3 refs., 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
