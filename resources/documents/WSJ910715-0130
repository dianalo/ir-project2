Since 1938, aSupreme Court ruling, National Labor Relations Board v.Mackay Radio andamp; Telegraph Co., has prohibited employers fromhiring permanent replacements during strikes if the companyis guilty of unfair labor practices. If, however, the workersstrike for higher pay or for other purely economicmotivations, the law permits companies to try to stay inbusiness by hiring replacement workers who do not have to befired at the end of the strike.   The equities are clear. In New York City, for example,local ordinances prohibit a department store from opening itsdoors if operating engineers (typically no more than five perstore) are not present to monitor the store's utilities. Itwould be unfair if a store's 800 employees had to be laid offand customers barred from the premises if these five peopledecided to strike indefinitely for an unreasonable wagedemand. Present law, therefore, gives the store the right tocontinue operating during such a strike by using permanentreplacements. Under the legislation being written by Sen.Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) and Rep. Bill Clay (D., Mo.),however, it would become illegal for the store to hirereplacements for economic strikers.</LP><TEXT>   Interest groups usually do not wait 50 years to overturn aSupreme Court decision they consider adverse. Yet in 1991,unions suddenly have begun to argue that the Mackay decisionhas taken away their right to strike.   Unions argue that before the 1981 PATCO strike, employersalmost never hired Mackay replacements. However, a study of251 National Labor Relations Board cases in which Mackayreplacements were hired found that all but 22 involvedstrikes that occurred before 1981. Because very few strikesare the subject of a reported NLRB case, this samplerepresents only the tip of the iceberg. The level of reportedMackay cases has remained relatively constant since 1940. Sounions fall back on several other questionable contentions.   They have asserted that, since the early 1980s, the hiringof Mackay replacements has been standard practice. Infact, apart from a few highly publicized cases, strikereplacements are anything but standard. A General AccountingOffice study requested by the strike bill's proponents showedthat, in 1985 and 1989, Mackay replacements were hired inonly 17% of all strikes. More significantly, this affectedonly 4% of all persons on strike in 1985, and 3% in 1989.   Unions accuse employers of forcing strikes by beingobstinate at the bargaining table and then replacing theunionized workforce once the strike begins. If this sounds asif it should be against the law, take comfort, it is. Laborlaw requires employers to bargain in &quot;good faith.&quot; If theyviolate that requirement or a long list of others, the NLRBwill order the employer to reinstate the strikers with backpay (often millions of dollars worth as happened with ColtIndustries in 1990), even if the company must fire thereplacements. The NLRB is not shy about imposing thissanction.   Unions claim that virtually all of America's economiccompetitors prohibit the replacement of strikers. That'strue. But America's competitors do not just reject Mackay;they reject the entire U.S. system of settling labordisputes. If the U.S. is to begin emulating foreign laborlaws, why not consider Germany's prohibition against strikesthat would &quot;grievously wound&quot; a company? Or doing away withany requirement that the parties try to reach an agreement,as in France? Or granting courts broad powers to enjoinstrikes as in the Netherlands? According to a recent pollconducted by Penn + Schoen, 85% of the American public(including 75% of all union members) favors granting courtsinjunctive powers where a strike affects public health andsafety, such as a strike of hospital employees.   The unions' principal argument is that under Mackay, thebalance of power hasshifted in favor of the employer. Thereis no question but that the ability of employers to maintainoperations during a strike provides significant leverage atthe bargaining table. If unions were able to depriveemployers of the right to operate, their bargaining powerwould be substantially increased. But, at some point, theright to strike must yield to the rights of others. AsJustice William Brennan observed in 1957, &quot;This protection{of the right to strike} is not so absolute as to denyself-help by employers when legitimate interests of employeesand employers collide.&quot;   At the same time, while the law allows a company to shielditself from the blows of an economic strike by trying tooperate with other employees, even this shield haslimitations. The law only permits the substitute employees tobe paid what the employer was offering the strikers. If thestrikers are saying, &quot;We won't work because you won't give uswhat we're worth,&quot; they run the risk that the employer mightfind others who will. Is this risk unfair? The Warren Courtdidn't think so when it wrote in 1965 that the &quot;right tobargain collectively does not entail any `right' to insist onone's position free from economic disadvantage.&quot; Further,even if replacements are hired, the employer cannot fire thestrikers, as proponents are fond of repeating. As openingsoccur after the strike ends, the company is mandated by lawto reinstate the strikers. It must also continue to bargainwith the union which may (and often does) result in anagreement reinstating all of the strikers. That's whathappened in the 1990 New York Daily News strike.   If Mackay seems harsh, so is the strike weapon. Harvardprofessor Archibald Cox has characterized in a 1958 lawreview article, the U.S. collective bargaining system as &quot;abrute contest of economic power somewhat masked by politemanners and voluminous statistics.&quot; The risks facing bothsides are what keeps the parties in check at the bargainingtable. If the risks are removed for one party -- as wouldoccur if Mackay were reversed -- it would be like tying acatcher's throwing arm behind his back. The base runner'sright to steal would be invigorated, but the game might beginto lack a certain balance.   ---   Mr. Yager, an attorney in Washington, D.C., is the authorof &quot;Loading the Scales: The Proposal to Overthrow the MackayDoctrine,&quot; for the Employment Policy Foundation, a researchgroup funded by large corporations.</TEXT></DOC>
