Box12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, had submittedpesticide petitions (PP 6F3366 and PP 7F3542 for potatoes and caneberries,respectively) to EPA proposing that 40 CFR Part 180 be amended by establishingtolerances for the combined residues of the fungicide iprodione [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-N-(1-methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboxamide],its isomer [3-(1-methylethyl)-N-(3,5-dischlorophenyl)-2,4-dioxol-imidazolidinecarboxamide],and its metabolite [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboxamide]in or on potatoes at 0.5 part per million (ppm) and in or on caneberriesat 25.0 ppm. There were no comments received in response to the notices of filing. The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The data considered include: 1. A three-generation rat reproduction study using dosage levels of 0,250, 500, and 2,000 ppm with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 500 ppm(25 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bwt/day)), areproductive lowest-effect level (LEL) of 2,000 ppm (100 mg/kg bwt/day),and a systemic NOEL equal to or greater than 2,000 ppm (100 mg/kg bwt/day);2. A rabbit teratology study in which the following doses were administeredby gavage: 0, 20, 60, and 200 mg/kg bwt, resulting in a teratogenic NOELequal to or greater than 60 mg/kg bwt; 3. A rat teratology study in which the following doses were administeredby gavage: 0, 40, 90, and 200 mg/kg bwt, resulting in a teratogenic NOELequal to 90 mg/kg bwt (considered supplementary under current guidelinesand may be upgraded to minimum with additional information); 4. A 24-month feeding/oncogenicity study in rats using dosage levels of125, 250, and 1,000 ppm (6.25, 12.5, and 50 mg/kg bwt/day), which showedno oncogenic effects under the conditions of the study; 5. An 18-month oncogenicity study in mice using dosage levels of 200, 500,and 1,250 ppm (28.6, 71.4, and 178.6 mg/kg bwt/day), which showed no oncogeniceffects under the conditions of the study. 6. A 1-year dog feeding study using dosage levels of 168, 600, and 3,600ppm (4.2, 15, and 90 mg/kg bwt/day) with a NOEL of 168 ppm (4.2 mg/kg bwt/day)and an LEL of 600 ppm (15 mg/kg bwt/day); and7. A 90-day dog feeding study using dosage levels of 800, 2,400, and 7,200ppm (20, 60, and 180 mg/kg bwt/day) with a NOEL of 2,400 ppm (60 mg/kgbwt/day) and an LEL of 7,200 ppm (180 mg/kg bwt/day).Data currently lacking include an appropriate toxicology laboratory animalmetabolism study and a potato processing study. The metabolism study iscurrently under review by Agency scientists. The Agency expects the potatoprocessing study to be submitted within 4 months.The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the NOEL of 4.2 mg/kg bwt/dayfrom the 1-year dog feeding study and using a hundredfold safety factor,is calculated to be 0.04 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residuecontribution from the proposed tolerances are 0.000835 mg/kg/day and utilizes2.09 percent of the ADI. These tolerances and the previously establishedtolerances utilize a total of 110.0 percent of the ADI for the U.S. populationaverage.Although the TMRC based on all established tolerances for iprodione exceedsthe ADI, the Agency believes that the actual residues to which the publicis likely to be exposed are considerably less than indicated by the TMRCfor the following reasons:1. Not all the planted crop for which a tolerance is established is normallytreated with the pesticide.2. Most treated crops have residue levels which are below the establishedtolerance level.3. Residues are frequently reduced when foods are processed or preparedfor human consumption.4. Not all crops contributing to the TMRC are likely to be consumed byan individual.There are no regulatory actions pending against the registration of iprodione.The metabolism of iprodione in plants and animals, except for general laboratoryanimal metabolism, is adequately understood for purposes of the tolerances.An analytical method, gas liquid chromatography using an electron capturedetector, is available in Volume II of the <T3>Pesticide Analytical Manual </T3>for enforcement purposes.The pesticide is useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought.Based on the data and information considered by the Agency, it is concludedthat the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.This tolerance for potatoes will expire 1 year after the date of publicationof this final rule. Based on the review of the potato processing data,the Agency will determine whether the issuance of a permanent toleranceis appropriate.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>file written objections with the Hearing Clerkat the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.If a hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for thehearing and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted ifthe objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify therelief sought.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="20">(Sec. 408(e), 68 Stat. 514 (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)))</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
