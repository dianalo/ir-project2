<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0362 </DOCNO><TEXT>Increasing interest in the use of high bandwidth optical diagnostic measurementsystems at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) has prompted the use of singlemode fiber (SMF). In an effort to improve the time response of experimentalsystems designed for use in the 800- to 900-m spectrum, SMF optimizedfor 850-nm operation has been obtained. Experimental systems to characterizethis fiber have been developed. Measurements to determine the fibers'bandwidth, material dispersion, mode field diameter (MFD), cut-off wavelength,numerical aperture (NA), and spectral attenuation have been completed.These experimental data are presented in the text.</TEXT></DOC>
