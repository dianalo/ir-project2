Bennett, said Monday that higher taxes may be needed ``down theroad'' to fight the war on drugs.   ``I'll go on record: crack is worse than taxes,'' Bennett toldreporters after a closed meeting with representatives of thenation's mayors, who want more federal anti-drug aid flowing tocities.   Bennett, after hearing the mayors' request, told reporters:   ``I don't think we immediately have to say, `Well, we're goingto have to raise taxes.' Maybe down the road we will. But I thinkthere are other choices. It's facing priorities.''   Bennett, the director of the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy, also said that crack _ a potent, highly addictive form ofcocaine _ is ``a hell of a lot worse than pork, too.''   Referring to unspecified ``pork barrel'' projects members ofCongress like to bring to their districts, he said, ``If we'regoing to spend more money on the war on drugs, we have got todecide where we're going to get the money to do it.''   Earlier, Bennett heard the mayors push a 16-point plan they wantincluded in the national drug control strategy he is to produce bySept. 5.   One point calls for increased aid for state and local anti-drugprograms ``with a significant portion of the funds going directlyto local governments,'' bypassing high-level bureaucracies.   Houston Mayor Kathryn Whitmire, president of the U.S. Conferenceof Mayors, commented after the meeting that ``most of us have hadto raise taxes in our local communities already to deal with thedrug problem, so we're not afraid to recommend that.''   Whitmire said Bennett made no commitment to back a tax increase.   New York City Mayor Ed Koch said, ``The people are ready toaccept an increase in taxes if they knew that the taxes were goingsolely to interdict drugs and not for some social program whichthey may or may not agree with.''   The slogan ``crack is worse than taxes,'' Koch said, ``meansthat people will pay to have this monster lifted from theirshoulders so their kids can be protected.''   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn called for $3 billion in federalfunds to be distributed to states and cities to fight the drug warand said, ``People will support tax dollars targeted to the war ondrugs.''   Flynn said he asked Bennett whether he would support anappropriation of $3 billion for the states and cities and was told,``It depends on what Congress does.''   Asked if Bush would support such a plan if Thomas S. Foley, thespeaker of the House, supports it, Flynn said:   ``I didn't get an answer out of Mr. Bennett. He said maybe wecould rearrange money someway from here to there.   ``That's not what we're talking about. We don't want to takemoney from the homeless or infant mortality or from child care ...or from affordable housing.''   Bennett acknowledged that fighting the war on drugs ``is goingto cost more money ... and I think we should look to the federalgovernment for some of that money.''   But he didn't say how much.   ``Mayors always ask for more,'' he said. ``That's what mayorsdo. I know that. They know that.''</TEXT></DOC>
