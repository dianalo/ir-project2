Lawyers and lobbyists who have been working for &quot;tortreform,&quot; changes in state and federal civil justice systemsto limit the liability of business for damages, virtuallydeclared victory over the decision. This despite the highcourt's refusal to set across-the-board standards and itsupholding of a $1,077,978 million verdict against PacificMutual Life Insurance Co.</LP><TEXT>   These lawyers said the decision was a victory because thecourt required state and federal courts to consider the&quot;reasonableness&quot; of punitive-damage awards in civil cases.   Consumer groups and plaintiffs' lawyers appeared to have amore legitimate claim to victory. The 7-1 decision, writtenby Justice Harry Blackmun, gave little hint of when, if ever,an award may be deemed unreasonable. The opinion said, forexample, that instructing a jury simply that punitive damagesare intended as punishment may be sufficient guidance from ajudge. That isn't exactly a precise standard.   Nevertheless, Martin Connor, president of one businesslobbying group, declared, &quot;This is the ruling the AmericanTort Reform Association has been waiting for.&quot; VictorSchwartz, counsel to another group, the Product LiabilityAlliance, said it was &quot;the first time in history&quot; that thecourt said the 14th Amendment guarantee of due process&quot;places some limits&quot; on punitive damages.   Some indication of whether there is any legitimacy to thebusiness lobby's claim of victory may come when the SupremeCourt decides what to do about nine other cases on its docketthat challenge punitive-damage awards. The justices have beenholding the nine cases in abeyance until after they decidedthe Pacific Mutual case. They are expected to announce soon,maybe even today, how they will handle the nine appeals.   If the high court denies review in all nine, that wouldlet stand punitive awards ranging from $400,000 to $2.5million. It would signal that the justices see no need tocontinue reviewing such challenges, since in their view theydidn't set any new standard that they must apply in othercases.   A different message would be sent if the justices followan alternate procedure of throwing out the nine earlierdecisions and ordering the lower courts to reconsider theawards applying the Pacific Mutual ruling. That would be readas a signal that the Pacific Mutual decision did set a newstandard that state and federal courts should now examine andbegin to apply.   There is another alternative, albeit an unlikely one. Thejustices might agree to hear another of the punitive-damagechallenges filed by corporations, suggesting that they wantto try again to limit the discretion of juries.   Two of the nine appeals are challenges by religious groupsarguing that the First Amendment guarantee of religiousfreedom should limit their liability for punitive damages. Ifthe court agrees to hear one of those cases, the issue wouldbe narrower than the concern with damages that has sopreoccupied business.   With the recent release of the final list of cases to beargued in the current term, the full picture of how theSupreme Court's docket has shrunk can be seen. If all of thecases that have been argued since October and that will beargued this month and next produce full decisions, the highcourt will issue 113 decisions in its current term.   That would be the smallest number of decisions, by far, in21 years. In the term that began in October 1970, there were109 decisions. Since then, the number hasn't dipped below123, has usually been more than 130, and hit 151 in the termthat began in October 1982. Last term, there were 129decisions.   The decrease doesn't mean the court is moving faster. Thejustices have 86 opinions to issue in the next 100 days.There were 94 to go at this time last year.   ---   The court's newest member, Justice David Souter, isreceiving high marks from his colleagues. Justice ByronWhite, at a reunion of his law clerks a few weeks ago inColorado, went out of his way, according to those present, topraise the new justice as bright, hardworking and verypleasant.</TEXT></DOC>
