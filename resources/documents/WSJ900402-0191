Analysts said that McDonnell Douglas had been planning arelatively simple variation on the wide-body, triple-enginejet for a couple of years, but that now it appears to bemoving toward a more radically modified aircraft, the MD-12X,which could involve a costly redesign of the wing.</LP><TEXT>   JAL's interest in the bigger plane, which would seatroughly 100 more passengers and compete with medium-rangeversions of Boeing Co.'s 747 jetliner, gives the MD-12X a&quot;significant lift,&quot; said a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas'scommercial aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif. &quot;We expect tohave a business plan ready for approval by the board aroundmid-year.&quot;   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas beat out AirbusIndustrie, the European aircraft consortium, for the JALcontract. &quot;After studying it (the two aircraft) from variousangles, we concluded that the MD-11 was the best buy,&quot; JALPresident Susumu Yamaji said at a press conference in Tokyoon Friday. He didn't say specifically what tipped thedecision in McDonnell Douglas's favor.   Mr. Yamaji denied that the decision to buy American ratherthan European airplanes was a political move to deflecttensions over Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with the U.S.But analysts said the political element could not becompletely discounted. &quot;(JAL's) reputation in the U.S. isvery important to them,&quot; one Tokyo analyst said.   JAL, Japan's largest domestic and international airline,said the MD-11s would be used to replace its current fleet of16 DC-10 models. The purchase is part of the airline's plansto add 20 medium-capacity jet aircraft to its fleet between1993 and 1998. A decision on which engines will be installedhasn't been reached. Delivery of the MD-11s is set to beginin late 1993, McDonnell Douglas said.   McDonnell Douglas said the JAL order brings to 340 thetotal of firm orders and &quot;other commitments&quot; for the MD-11.The jetliner, an updated version of the DC-10 model, made itsfirst flight test in January. &quot;We're shooting for (FederalAviation Administration) certification in October, withdeliveries to begin soon thereafter,&quot; the company spokesmansaid.   McDonnell Douglas said that JAL may convert some of itsMD-11 options to MD-12X orders if the company launches theproposed program by the end of the year. The MD-12X couldseat up to 441 passengers in a two-class configuration,compared with 323 passengers in the MD-11, the spokesmansaid. The MD-12X would have a range of about 5,600 miles,versus 8,000 miles for the MD-11. McDonnell Douglas declinedto disclose any cost estimates for the proposed MD-12X.   &quot;If it needs new wings, which is almost certain, it wouldbe a formidable cost factor,&quot; said Paul Nisbet, an aerospaceanalyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The developmentcost could be more than $2 billion, he estimates. That isroughly triple the $700 million the company has said it willspend on the MD-11, which uses essentially the same wings andfuselage as the DC-10.   Mr. Nisbet said the proposed MD-12X triple-engine jetcould be more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 747, which hasfour engines, on trans-Atlantic and other medium-rangeroutes. The MD-12X wouldn't be able to carry enough fuel tofly from the East Coast of the U.S. across the Pacific Ocean.However, he cautioned that the plane is &quot;more or less wishfulthinking&quot; until the company has firm orders, prices anddelivery dates.</TEXT></DOC>
