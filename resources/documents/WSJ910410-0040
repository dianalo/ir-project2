He said the conflict shows that Hong Kong'stransition to Chinese rule in 1997 &quot;will from time to timeprove a stony and an uphill road.&quot;   He indicated that he sees no choice but to continuenegotiations with China. During his weeklong trip, he waspreoccupied with the colony's so-called Port and AirportDevelopment Strategy. Estimated at one time to cost 127billion Hong Kong dollars (US$16.29 billion), the plan mustbe endorsed by China to secure private-sector financing. ButChina has refused to do so unless it gets some control overthe colony's fiscal policies.   Bilateral talks are continuing in Beijing. Chinese PremierLi Peng expressed confidence that a pact on the new airportmay be reached soon.   Other Chinese officials also met with Mr. Hurd. To thatextent, the visit marked a big step toward ending thediplomatic isolation in which China found itself aftercrushing pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989.                                                                                                          BRITONS OUTRAGED ABOUT ZOO                                                                                                          Private donations flooded the London Zoo, which says itwill close and some of its 8,000 animals will die withoutmore government cash. But officials, noting the zoo hasn'tspent its first and only government grant, said they won't beforced into a second bail-out in three years. Parliamentmembers sought a debate on what to do with the privatelyfinanced zoo in Regent's Park, set up in 1828 by the RoyalZoological Society of London and the brainchild of SirStamford Raffles, founder of Singapore.

JAPAN URGES INSURANCE LOOSENING                                                                                                          A liberalization of Japan's insurance industry was urgedby the Finance Ministry's insurance advisory committee. Thepanel called for easing significantly the barriers separatingJapanese life and nonlife insurers, relaxing restrictions onthe types of investments insurance companies can make andallowing them more flexibility in raising funds. Itrecommends life insurers introduce capital adequacy rules.But it said further study is needed on insurers' entering thebanking and securities sectors.                                                                                                          MORE RUBLES FOR MCDONALD'S                                                                                                          For the second time since a McDonald's Corp.Canadian-Soviet-owned outlet opened in Moscow in January1990, prices were raised. The restaurant, the largestMcDonald's in the world, serves 45,000 to 50,000 peopledaily. It boosted prices an average of 35%, six days afterthe Kremlin raised the tab 250% to 1,000% for food and otherconsumer goods. It also increased its employees' monthlysalaries to 800 rubles ($1,360) from 500 rubles ($850).Soviet workers are paid an average of 330 rubles a month.                                                                                                          BEIJING READS BETWEEN LINES                                                                                                          Chinese Premier Li Peng brushed aside a call for him tostep down that appeared as a hidden message in a poem in theoverseas edition of the Communist Party newspaper, thePeople's Daily. Dissidents, he said at his annualpost-legislative news conference, don't represent the publicwill. He said he expects to finish serving his five-yearterm, which ends in 1993. The Security Ministry has failed totrack down the poem's author.                                                                                                          INDONESIA PICKS MCDONNELL                                                                                                          Jakarta has chosen McDonnell Douglas Corp. to launchIndonesia's next communications satellite, ending a debatethat once had the government leaning toward a Chinesecompany.   The U.S company's Delta rocket was selected to launchIndonesia's Palapa B-4 satellite. McDonnell Douglas agreed tothe launch for $44 million, down from its initial bid lastAugust of $47.8 million. The other two offers Indonesiareceived, from China Great Wall Industries and the French-ledArianespace consortium, met all the technical requirements,but the U.S. bid provided a better return on Jakarta's launchinvestment.   Indonesia didn't specify the total cost, includinginsurance, but industry analysts estimate it at $115 million.   Delta rockets have launched most of Indonesia's pastsatellites. The bid by McDonnell Douglas was strengthened byits perceived ability to launch sooner and keep the B-4operating longer. If the B-4 doesn't go up soon, Jakartafears another country could threaten Indonesia's strategicdominance in regional satellite telecommunications.
