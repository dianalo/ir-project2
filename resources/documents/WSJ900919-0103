Many   Is Expected to Get   Nynex Belgian Job   ----   By Mary Lu Carnevale   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B12</SO><CO>   NYN WNEWS</CO><IN>TELEPHONE SYSTEMS (TLS)</IN><LP>   Nynex Corp., signaling a more aggressive posture overseas,is expected to name Charles J. Many to head a newinternational office in Brussels, Belgium.   Mr. Many, president of Nynex Mobile Communications, thecompany's cellular unit, has a reputation within the cellularindustry as a tenacious executive with a keen interest inmarketing. He has also been a driving force in Nynex Mobile'spush into emerging cellular technologies. Earlier thissummer, for instance, Nynex announced plans to build apersonal communications network in Manhattan based on atechnology called code division multiple access, or CDMA,which allows many more simultaneous conversations than othertechnologies.</LP><TEXT>   Like other Baby Bells, Nynex is playing catch-up with SanFrancisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, which teamed withEuropean partners to win an important contract to build andoperate a cellular system in Germany. Although Nynex and itsU.K. partners aggressively pursued cable televisionfranchises in the U.K., the company's European businesslargely consists of computer software sales and consulting.   A Nynex spokesman declined to comment on reports that Mr.Many would soon be transferred to Europe, and Mr. Many wasn'tavailable. The spokesman acknowledged that the company ispositioning itself to take advantage of twin forces at workin the global telecommunications market: privatization andderegulation. &quot;We're very serious about internationalmarkets,&quot; the spokesman said. Important parts of thatstrategy, he said, are cellular and data communications. InApril, Nynex set up a Worldwide Information andamp; CellularServices Group, headed by Ivan G. Seidenberg, a corporateexecutive vice president.   The company is expected to make other executive changes,including naming Mr. Many's successor at Nynex Mobile andreorganizing Materiel Enterprises Co., the purchasing arm forNew York Telephone and New England Telephone, people familiarwith the situation said.   Overseas operations last year accounted for only a smallfraction of Nynex's $13.2 billion in revenue. But the companyhas said that it is counting on foreign ventures to bring inas much as 20% of its revenue by the end of the decade.   &quot;The fact that Nynex has chosen a cellular guy is good,&quot;said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. &quot;The onlything that makes sense in Europe is cellular as opposed tobecoming some minority partner in a land-line network.&quot;   Mr. Many, a native of New York City, joined BellLaboratories in 1960 and held several management positionsbefore moving in 1975 to New York Telephone, where he heldjobs in management information systems, networking andmarketing. From there, he moved to Nynex Business InformationSystems Co., holding jobs as vice president of sales, vicepresident of new ventures and vice president of marketing. Hebecame president of Nynex Mobile in 1986, and has brieflybeen chairman of the Cellular Telecommunications IndustryAssociation, the main trade group for the cellular industry.</TEXT></DOC>
