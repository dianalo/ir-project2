The basic experiment was made by a heat resistant tubeand metal bath to study loading conditions, heating temperature (heatingrate), sample grain size, grain size distribution, packing density andthe blending difference. The basic conditions such as 15 weight % orless moisture, 50-60% of 200 mesh or less grain size, 25% of 60-100 meshand heating temperature accuracy of +- 1C were established from thisexperiment. An automatic measuring device was fabricated to install onthe practical operating line. Sampling from the conveyor line, drying,crushing, sample division and dilation measurement are carried out byusing a robot without manpower. The measuring time was about 1 hour whichwas substatially shortened compared with 22 hours of the JIS method andthe accuracy and precision were also evaluated as excellent.
