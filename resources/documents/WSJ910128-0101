Greenberger   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/28/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><GV>STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration has been using Swissemissaries since the early days of the Persian Gulf crisis tosend private assurances to Iran that U.S. actions againstIraq pose no threat to Tehran.   Now, it's clear that the communication is two-way. Overthe weekend, Secretary of State James Baker said the U.S. has&quot;been assured that Iran intends to remain totally neutral&quot;and that the more than three dozen Iraqi aircraft that havelanded in Iran will be impounded until hostilities end.</LP><TEXT>   Only a few years ago, Iran, not Iraq, was Washington'sdemon in the Gulf region. And it would still be extremelydifficult to begin rebuilding with Tehran the relations thatwere shattered more than a decade ago with the overthrow ofthe shah and the seizing of U.S. hostages by a vehementlyanti-American regime. Nevertheless, the current crisis mayoffer some opportunities.   For the U.S., even the prospect of establishing ties withTehran would be an immense psychological blow to IraqiPresident Saddam Hussein. An improved relationship also couldpave the way for a stable security arrangement in the Gulfonce hostilities end. At the same time, it would offer Iran,which remains deeply fearful of U.S. dominance, a role itcovets in postwar regional security talks.   &quot;I think it is in our long-term interest to be on betterterms with Iran,&quot; says Harold Brown, President Carter'sdefense secretary.   &quot;Can the U.S. and Iran work together?&quot; asks HowardTeicher, a Mideast specialist who worked in the Carter andReagan administrations. &quot;With its military potential, Irancould scare the Iraqis, which could help shorten the war. And(Iran could) participate in the post-war order. That suggeststo me it's worth thinking about.&quot;   Senior administration officials express concern, however,that moving to improve relations with Iran would stirdomestic political criticism. So at the outset, the WhiteHouse would have to win a clear commitment from Tehran toexert its influence to help free Americans held hostage byfundamentalist groups in Lebanon, and to end all links withterrorist groups.   So far, Tehran hasn't budged on these issues, and its owninternal politics may make such a move impossible.Nevertheless, Shaul Bakhash, a history professor at GeorgeMason University and an expert on Iran, says the Gulf warraises two major concerns for Tehran that could be exploitedby the U.S.   First, he says, Iran fears that an Iraqi defeat will leavethe U.S. with a permanent force in the region and a free handto shape post-war security arrangements along with U.S. allySaudi Arabia.   Second, Iran is worried that a major military defeat couldlead to the breakup of Iraq, with Turkey and Syria making agrab for territory. This redrawing of the map coulddestabilize the entire region. During the Iran-Iraq war,Tehran hoped that Iraq would be replaced by an Islamicrepublic heavily influenced by Iran. Lately, though, Iranianofficials are stressing that Iraq's territorial integrityshould be maintained.   Still, there are considerable obstacles to a betterrelationship. According to Prof. Bakhash, radicals in Iran,while hoping for Saddam Hussein's defeat, are competing forleadership in the Islamic world by increasing the intensityof their anti-American and anti-Zionist rhetoric. This couldinhibit more pragmatic forces in Iran from building ties withthe U.S.   He concludes that Iran's desire to participate in post-warsecurity discussions provide a big opportunity for the U.S.But he adds that U.S.-Iranian dialogue at least initiallywould have to be &quot;discreet, cautious and exploratory,&quot;probably carried out through an intermediary.   William Quandt, a Mideast expert at the BrookingsInstitution, believes that within a few years, Iran's tieswith the West will improve and &quot;people will again be sellingarms&quot; to Tehran. And Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former nationalsecurity adviser, predicted on CNN's &quot;Newsmaker Sunday&quot; thatIran will emerge from the crisis as &quot;the dominant power inthe Persian Gulf.&quot;   Mr. Teicher, who as a government analyst predicted Iraq's1980 invasion of Iran and subsequent aggressive behavior,adds that the U.S. could begin taking steps now &quot;to beginde-demonizing the Iranians.&quot; For instance, Operation Staunch,the Reagan administration's campaign to bar arms shipments toIran during the Iran-Iraq war, which still is technically ineffect, could be ended.   Ironically, the Reagan administration itself violatedOperation Staunch, covertly shipping arms to Tehran in whatbecame known as the Iran-Contra scandal. Mr. Teicher, whoworked at the National Security Council at the time, wasnever charged with any wrongdoing. He still believes thatstrengthening ties with Iran will pay big dividends.   &quot;It may take a little time,&quot; he concludes. &quot;But it maytake more time than people think to win this war.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
