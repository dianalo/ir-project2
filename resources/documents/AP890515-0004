Cedric Thornberry, a senior spokesman for the U.N. monitoringforce in Namibia, predicted Monday that South Africa would complywith a timetable calling for removal of all but 1,500 of itssoldiers by June 30.   The planned one-year transition to independence was disrupted onApril 1, the day it began, when an estimated 1,600 guerrillas ofthe South-West Africa People's Organization crossed into northernNamibia despite an arrangement for them to remain at their bases inAngola.   South African officials say 316 guerrillas and 27 members of thesecurity forces were killed in clashes that followed the incursion.SWAPO leaders subsequently instructed their men to withdraw toAngola.   On Monday, officials from South Africa, Cuba and Angola met atRuacana, an Angolan town near the Namibian border, to assess theextent of SWAPO's withdrawal. South Africa has said the entireindependence process could be in jeopardy if it determines thatsubstantial numbers of guerrillas have failed to move to bases atleast 100 miles inside Angola.   U.S., Soviet and United Nations officials attended the talks asobservers.   South African military units, which were supposed to be confinedto base under terms of the U.N. independence plan, emerged toassist territorial police in pursuing the guerrillas. The troopsreturned to base Saturday.   South Africa agreed to end its 74-year rule over Namibia as partof an agreement signed in December which also calls for a phasedwithdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola.</TEXT></DOC>
