The Food and Drug Administration plans to meet soon with severalpharmaceutical companies to ask them to stop marketing themedications to prevent breast engorgement after childbirth.   An FDA advisory council concluded earlier this month that mildpainkillers and breast-binding are as effective as these medicationsin easing the discomfort and carry none of the health risks.   ``Nature takes care of the problem very quickly,'' usually withintwo or three days after childbirth, said Susan McKay, a Wyomingpsychologist who is on the advisory panel. Yet, doctors are treatingthe condition with medications that have to be taken for two weeks,she said.   ``Why are we subjecting women to this if after a few days it willresolve itself anyway?'' she said.   Panel members also said evidence showed that only about 10percent of women who don't breast-feed have significant pain intheir breasts from the accumulation of milk. But, they said, eventhese women can be treated without drugs and hormones.   Philip A. Corfman, executive secretary of the advisory counciland FDA's supervisory medical officer for fertility and maternalhealth drugs, said voluntary compliance by the pharmaceuticalcompanies is the first and preferred step.   The FDA isn't seeking to ban the drugs and hormones. Themedications have other FDA-approved uses for which medicalspecialists agree they are valuable.   But the agency may meet resistance from the companies. Althoughsome of the companies said they have not been contacted by the FDAand would not comment on the impending request, their leaders defendthe safety and effectiveness of their products.   Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J., which makesbromocriptine, sold under the name Parlodel and the most widely usedof the medications, proposed to the FDA revised package inserts toinform physicians of alternative therapies and brochures to educatewomen.   ``We feel it should be a free choice by an informed patient andher physician,'' said David L. Winter, a spokesman for Sandoz.   About 40 percent of women who give birth don't breast-feed, andWinter said a company study found that 36 percent of these womenhave pain in their breasts after delivery.   Bromocriptine has been taken by more than 4 million women duringthe nine years it has been on the market, and though it has beenfound to cause minor side effects _ including nausea and dizziness _no serious adverse effects have been proven, he said.   Critics, however, note that there have been a small number ofreports of heart attacks, strokes and seizures associated with useof the drug.   Use of estrogen and androgen hormones and their combinations havebeen shown to raise the risk of blood clots, Corfman said.   But William Donaldson, a spokesman for Merrell DowPharmaceuticals Inc., defended the safety of TACE, an estrogenmarketed by the company. The company has had four reports ofblood-clotting problems, but none has been reported since 1975, hesaid.   ``If there are patients who are suffering that cannot be relievedin other ways, the drug works and it is safe and it is anotherproduct for physicians to prescribe,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
