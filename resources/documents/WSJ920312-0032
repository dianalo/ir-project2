Mr. Murdoch named long-time News Corp. executive JohnEvans president and chief executive officer of NewsElectronic Data division. Mr. Evans said in an interview thatNews Corp.'s various media properties -- magazines,newspapers, books -- would be transferred to digital form anddistributed electronically through telephone lines. He saidthe NED division would create electronic versions of theLondon Times, TV Guide, even personal ads from News Corp.newspapers, in the next 18 months to two years.</LP><TEXT>   The digital information that NED will create is for a newarray of machines that represent a convergence of theconsumer electronics and PC industries. A number ofcompanies, such as Apple Computer Inc., are busy creating newgadgets called &quot;personal digital assistants,&quot; which aresomething of cross between a cellular telephone and a Boss orWizard executive organizer. NED would only supply the datafor such machines, which will be able to send and retrievedata from larger computers.   Some companies, such as McGraw-Hill Inc., Knight-RidderInc. and Dow Jones andamp; Co., already provide digital informationthrough phone lines, though News Corp.'s plan also envisionssending data via cellular networks.   Mr. Evans said he is currently in negotiations withleaders in both the consumer electronics and computerindustry to form a &quot;series of alliances&quot; that would positionNews Corp.'s NED as a main supplier for the emergingtechnology.   Mr. Evans said an example of the new technology could be abusinessman calling up a city road map and weatherinformation, or a news service and sports news, via ahand-held &quot;personal communicator.&quot; Initially, News Corp.would be able to deliver full graphics, text and some soundto the new devices.   The first customers of the digital information areexpected to be PC operators with modems that can retrieveinformation through telephone lines or from a cellular phonenetwork. The data would later be available for the hand-heldmachines.   Mr. Evans in the 1980s was head of News Corp.'s consumerand trade magazines, where he also invested in developingelectronic publishing properties. Most recently, he oversawMr. Murdoch's U.K. newspaper operations.</TEXT></DOC>
