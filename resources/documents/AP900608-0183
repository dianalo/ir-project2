The African National Congress leader said the South Africaneconomy then would require massive international aid ``if we are tomove forward at a pace that recognized the urgency of the needs ofour people.''   Mandela, 71, on the second leg of a six-week, trans-Atlantictrip, canceled a morning meeting with Red Cross officials due tofatigue, a Red Cross spokeswoman said.   But he spoke later to the International Labor Organization, theWorld Council of Churches and Foreign Minister Rene Felber.   Mandela received a loud ovation from more than 2,000 delegates tothe U.N. labor organization.   He told the 150-nation assembly he was encouraged by Thursday'slifting of the state of emergency in most of South Africa as well asby the release of more political prisoners.   ``These steps constitute part of the process of implementing whatwas agreed (with President F.W. De Klerk) a month ago,'' he said.``Of course, more will have to be done to ensure that the agreementis implemented in full.''   He said he was convinced that de Klerk and his colleagues ``aremen and women of integrity,'' but ``until what was agreed has beendone, we cannot afford to lower our guard'' and relax economicsanctions.   Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, concludedhis speech by speaking of ``the glorious vision of a South Africafree of racism, free of racial antagonisms among our people, nolonger a threat to peace, no longer the skunk of the world.''   The U.N. agency, which sets international standards for laborconditions, expelled South Africa 25 years ago for its racialpolicies.   Under apartheid, the nation's 28 million blacks are deprived of asay in the government, while the 5 million whites control theeconomy and maintain separate services.   At the Geneva headquarters of the World Council of Churches,hundreds of supports gave Mandela the clenched-fist ANC salute.   He thanked the meeting for the support given him and fellowanti-apartheid fighters by the council, which has provided financialassistance to the ANC for more than a decade.   Speaking with a firm voice and without a text, he said``religions, Christian and non-Christian, have been the only sourceof hope for many years'' for him.   During talks with the foreign minister, Mandela urged Switzerlandto add to Western pressure on South Africa and impose its ownsanctions against the country, a government spokesman said.   Neutral Switzerland has never joined in the sanctions but hasrepeatedly condemned racial segregation.   Spokesman Michel Pache said that during the 90-minute meeting inBern, the capital, Felber said Switzerland was ready to promoteeconomic contacts with the ANC.   Mandela will stay in Switzerland this weekend before continuingto West Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, Ireland, Britainand several African countries. He is scheduled to meet with Swissanti-apartheid groups and U.N. refugee officials Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
