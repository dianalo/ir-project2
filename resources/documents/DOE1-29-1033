In order to achieve fiber pull-out, theremust be a weak interface between the matrix and the fiber. In this study,the interface formed at elevated temperatures between alumina and a zirconia-bearingglass-ceramic was characterized to determine its chemical and mechanicalproperties. The interface was analyzed in planar and cross-sectionalspecimens by SEM, TEM, optical microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. Itwas found that the diffusion of alumina into the glass-ceramic producesa dense layer of zirconia crystallization in the glass-ceramic within20 microns of the alumina. The strength of the interface is inverselyproportional to the thickness of this layer. Firing at longer times andhigher temperatures produces the weakest interface. Activation energies(Q) and diffusion coefficients of aluminum into the glass matrix werecalculated using a nonlinear regression analysis and data from ion microprobeprofiles. Q was calculated to be 538 kJ/mol and the preexponential diffusioncoefficient, D{sub 0}, was found to be 4.96 x 10{sup 7} cm{sup 2}/s.Some interfaces fractured spontaneously, possibly because of the martensitictransformation of zirconia. Although it is possible to achieve a weakinterface, a weak interface demands long firing times (greater than threehours) or high temperatures (greater than 1425{sup 0}C). Under such rigorousconditions, a 20 {mu}m diameter alumina fiber will totally dissolve.For this reason, the development of an in-situ ZrO{sub 2} crystallizationlayer is not a suitable method to produce tough alumina fiber reinforced/glassceramic composites. 18 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
