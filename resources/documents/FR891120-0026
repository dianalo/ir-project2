The licensing policies for these control programsare described in part 776 and 785 of the Export Administration Regulations.On January 19, 1989, the Secretary submitted a report to Congress extendingforeign policy controls for another year. All foreign policy export controlsin effect as of that date were extended. One new control since that datehas been promulgated, pertaining to chemical and biological agents (andSection;776.19). This control was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 28, 1989 (54 FR 8281).To assure maximum public participation in the review process, commentson the extension or revision of the existing foreign policy controls foranother year are solicited. BXA is particularly interested in the experienceof individual exporters in complying with these controls, with emphasison economic impact and specific instances of business lost to foreign competitors.BXA is also interested in comments relating to the effects of foreign policycontrols on exports of replacement and other parts.Parties submitting comments are asked to be as specific as possible. Allcomments received before the close of the comment period will be consideredby the Department in reviewing the controls and developing the report toCongress. Among the criteria the Department considers in determining whetherto continue or revise U.S. foreign policy export controls are the following:1. The probability that such controls will achieve the intended foreignpolicy purpose, in light of other factors, including the availability fromother countries of the goods or technology proposed for such controls,and that the foreign policy purpose cannot be achieved through negotiationsor other alternative means;2. The compatibility of the proposed controls with the foreign policy objectivesof the United States and with overall United States policy toward the countryto which exports are to be subject to the proposed controls;3. The likelihood that the reaction of other countries to the extensionof such controls by the United States will render the controls ineffectivein achieving the intended foreign policy purpose or be counterproductiveto United States foreign policy interests;4. Whether the effect of the proposed controls on the export performanceof the United States, the competitive position of the United States inthe international economy, the international reputation of the United Statesas a supplier of goods and technology, or on the economic well-being ofindividual United States companies and their employees and communitiesdoes not exceed the benefit to United States foreign policy objectives;5. The ability of the United States to enforce the proposed controls effectively;and6. The foreign policy consequences of not extending the export controls.The Department will accept comments or information accompanied by a requestthat part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of itsproprietary nature or for any other reason.
