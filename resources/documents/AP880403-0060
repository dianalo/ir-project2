A dozen surfers paired up with dogs, geese and even fish in anaquarium Saturday at the ``Wet Pet'' exhibition at the Rell SunnMenehune Surfing Championships. Riding tandem on longboards, humanand pet surfers competed before a crowd of 2,000 at Makaha Beach onOahu.   Professional surfer and lifeguard Brian Keaulana, 26, and3-month-old Chop Chop came in first with their perfect score.   ``It was a great ride,'' Keaulana said. ``I slapped the pig inthe behind and it went to the nose.   ``He did kind of a hang ten, but pigs have cloven hoofs, so Iguess it was more like a hang four,'' Keaulana said. ``He liked ita lot. He was jumping around and going crazy.''   The ``Wet Pet'' exhibition is part of the Rell Sunn Menehune, asurfing competition for children 15 and under.   Keaulana doubts he and Chop Chop will return to defend theirtitle in 1989.   ``He'll probably be 300 pounds next year,'' Keaulana said.``It'll be tough to get him on the board.''   Keaulana won a trophy and Chop Chop won a reprieve from becomingthe main course at a luau.   ``I guess we can't eat him, now that he's famous,'' Keaulanasaid.</TEXT></DOC>
