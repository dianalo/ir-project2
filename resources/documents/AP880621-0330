The agency's first effort to unload the loans failed when noneof the bids met the minimum price or other conditions it had set,FDIC officials said.   ``Anytime you put something up for sale and you don't sell it,it can be regarded as a disappointment,'' said Arthur LotrentzenJr., assistant director of credit at the FDIC in Washington.   But he said some bidders expressed interest in some of the loansand that the agency might be able to sell portions of them.   The FDIC had predicted that it would lose $1.7 billion of the$3.5 billion it paid for the loans from Continental when it savedthe bank from failure four years ago.   The attempted sale was the biggest ever by the FDIC and thefirst in which the agency revealed the minimum price it wouldaccept.   The agency announced it was seeking a minimum of $415.7 million,or 33 cents on the dollar, for the entire loan portfolio, whichincludes 520 loans in six industry categories.   ``None of the bids conformed to what we sent out,'' said ThomasBeshara, Chicago regional director of the FDIC's division ofliquidation.   Beshara refused to say how many bids were received. Nor would hesay if the bids received by the FDIC is an indication that theloans may be of poorer quality than the agency estimated.   Now, however, the agency will review the feasibility of holdingmore negotiations with bidders or discussing the sale of smallerparcels of loans.   ``The interest certainly is there in breakdowns'' of loancategories, Beshara added. ``We're looking with a positiveattitude'' toward any future negotiations.   The six loan categories are international, oil and gas,commercial, personal, maritime and real estate. The largest amountof loans, $624.9 million, is in the oil and gas field.</TEXT></DOC>
