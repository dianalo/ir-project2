(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A $1-million-a-year programhas relocated 62 sea otters to an island off Southern California,but 27 of the endangered beasts have vanished without a trace.   ``Sure we're concerned,'' said Jim Estes, who is monitoring theprogram for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``We wish we had 62 seaotters there. But we've only been at this six months. We need moretime with these animals.''   In addition to 27 otters missing since Aug. 8 after being movedto San Nicolas Island, about 60 miles off the coast, eight havedied and six are known to have left the area, the state CoastalCommission learned Tuesday.   ``We've lost most of the adults out there,'' Estes told thecommission, but added, ``we have only just begun to look foranimals that have dispersed from the island.''   ``You stand before us and tell us that you can't account foralmost one-half of the population you transferred out there,''Commissioner Dorrill Wright responded. He said he was ``veryunhappy'' about the report.   The otters were the first of several groups to be airlifted overfive years to the small, rocky island that was once a breedingground of the animals, which were hunted to near extinction beforethe turn of the century.   The California population of sea otters numbers about 1,400 andlives along a 300-mile stretch of the central California coast fromMorro Bay to Santa Cruz.   The airlift to San Nicolas was part of an effort to establishanother population center for the animals off Southern California.State and federal marine biologists say the California populationcould be threatened with extinction if their breeding grounds arehit with an oil spill or disease.   The population transfer was opposed by local fishermen, whofeared that the otters would wipe out abalone, lobsters and othermarketable marine life.   Of the eight otters that died, three perished from stressrelated to the transfer, three drowned in lobster traps and fishingnets, one was shot and one was found dead of unknown causes,according to the report.   Officials have acknowledged that at least six otters have eludedrecapture and managed to swim home to Monterey. Another was caughtoff the northern Los Angeles County coastline and returned to itsoriginal capture site, officials said.   Wildlife officials hope to continue relocating sea otters to SanNicolas Island.   ``We've learned a lot and we are guardedly optimistic,'' saidDavid Riley, an assistant regional director with the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service.   Carol Fulton, representing Friends of the Sea Otter, aCarmel-based group that claims 4,500 members nationwide, supportedthe project.   ``The issue has to be put in perspective,'' she said. ``We werelosing over 100 otters a year in fishermen's gill nets within theirpresent range.''</TEXT></DOC>
