Replacement offuel-grade light and medium fractions is not in progress and their useis rather expanding. Methanol looks promising because its propertiesare almost equal to petroleum and can be produced from natural gas orcoal, which is good from the viewpoint of resources. In this report of205 pages, the following items are described. Existence of resources.Production technology (Present, near future, distant future). Utilizationtechnology (Internal combustion engine, power generation, etc). Distributionand environmental protection. Economic calculation (cost calculationof fuel-grade methanol. Comparison with liquified natural gas. Economicassessment). Scale of demand (Internal combustion engine, Power generation).Natural gas, being hopeful of low cost production, will be used in thefirst development stage; the second stage will use coal when the gasificationtechnology develops. The development must be started as early as possible.(50 figs, 62 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
