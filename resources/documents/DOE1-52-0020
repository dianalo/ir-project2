Detection of nodule calcificationhas been a strong indicator of benign lesions to differentiate from malignancy.We performed CT nodule densitometry in 55 patients with pulmonary nodule,comparing with that of a lung phantom. The cases comprised 16 primarylung cancers, 24 metastases and 15 benign masses including 10 granulomas,3 tuberculomas and 2 hamartomas. They were verified by histologicallyor clinically diagnosed. The lung phantom was CIRS Model III DiagnosticPhantom, Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Norfolk, Virginia. TheCT scanner used was a TCT 60A-60 and CT images were taken with 2 mm slisethickness. The phantom was scanned immediately after the patient, withidentical technical factors, in a configuration simulating as closelyas possible the patient's anatomy at the position of the nodule. Therelative CT number (RCT) was calculated to facilitate standardized quantitativeanalysis of pulmonary nodule, dividing the attenuation value of pulmonarynodule by that of the phantom nodule. RCT of 40 malignant tumors wereless than 0.75. And there were no significant differences among the histologicaltypes of lung cancer cases. RCT of 13 benign lesions were more than 0.8.In 2 cases of hamartoma, one case demonstrated calcified foci and theRCT was 2.78. Remaining one case had no calcified focus, showing 0.39RCT value. CT numbers of pulmonary nodules significantly vary due toseveral factors such as position, environment, nodule size etc, whichcan be standardized by using lung phantom. In addition, thin slice scanningcan avoid the effect of partial volume phenomenon. In conclusion, usingthin slice scanning method, lung phantom facilitates quantitative analysisof pulmonary nodules.</TEXT></DOC>
