The Philippine Red Cross said reports Friday from isolated areasshowed that at least 75 people were killed by widespread floodingand landslides on Palawan Island, 250 miles southwest of Manila.   Floods and mudslides caused by Tropical Storm Tess swampedPalawan last weekend, and Typhoon Skip worsened the situation withmore rain early this week, said Lourdes Masing, Red Cross supervisorfor relief.   Before Tess and Skip, Typhoon Ruby battered most of the countryOct. 24-25.   Miss Masing said many areas on Palawan have not been heard frombecause of poor communications, and as many as 600 islanders arebelieved missing.   Tito Larrosa, civil defense coordinator on Palawan, said somelandslides and floods hit simultaneously Nov. 4-5.   In one area, timber piled up at a logging camp crashed down amountainside with flood waters and crushed an undetermined number ofhouses, a Red Cross report said.   ``In Rizal, when the water came from the mountains, it wasfollowed by the mud,'' Larrosa said in a telephone interview fromthe Palawan provincial capital of Puerto Princesa.   ``We heard about the floods on Nov. 6, but it was not only untilyesterday that the reports of the deaths started coming,'' he said.``We have not heard from the Calamian group,'' a cluster of islandsnorth of Palawan that is part of the province.   The mountainous, isolated, jungle-covered island is known as thePhilippines' ``last frontier.''   Larrosa said among the hardest hit towns was Rizal, where 23people were confirmed killed by the torrents of mud and water fromthe mountains.   Until the reports from Palawan came in, officials had reportedonly 11 deaths from Tropical Storm Tess.   Officials said 181 people were killed on land when Typhoon Rubystruck. At least 64 more people drowned when the ferry Dona Marilynsank at the height of its fury. Another 200 passengers are missingand presumed dead.   The death toll from Typhoon Skip, which hit the centralPhilippines Nov. 7, stood at 139 Friday. But officials said theyexpected it to rise further as more reports from remote areas camein.</TEXT></DOC>
