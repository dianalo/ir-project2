CEBA permits national agricultural banksto amortize losses on qualified agricultural loans. This final rule describesthe procedures and standards applicable to national banks desiring to amortizethose losses. It also describes the manner in which amortizations are tobe done. This final rule is intended to benefit small, agricultural banks by providinga form of capital relief and, thereby, added time to work out problemsbrought about by the extended downturn in the agricultural industry. This action is needed to make final the temporary rule issued on November2, 1987. After consideration of comments received, the OCC is making onesubstantive change and several technical changes to its temporary rule.The substantive change allows eligible national banks to amortize losseson the reappraisal or sale of real or personal property acquired in connectionwith a qualified agricultural loan and that the bank owned on January 1,1983, or acquires prior to January 1, 1992, whether or not that propertyis ``currently owned.'' Under the temporary rule, property had to be currentlyowned for the loss to qualify for deferral. The technical changes: (1)Amend the definition of ``qualified agricultural loan'' and ``qualifiedagricultural bank'' to clarify that the OCC intends to construe the phrasesbroadly; (2) add a definition of ``agriculturally related other property'';(3) clarify the relationship between 12 CFR Part 35 and the alternativelegal lending limit in 12 CFR 32.8; and (4) include various minor wordingchanges intended to enhance clarity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>James F.E.

CEBA also required that the federal banking agencies issue implementingregulations no later than November 9, 1987. The OCC initially publishedthis regulation as a temporary rule on November 2, 1987 (52 FR 41959),effective November 9, 1987, in order to comply with this statutory requirement.Interested parties had the opportunity to comment by January 4, 1988. TheBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, on November 3, 1987 (52FR 42087), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''), onNovember 2, 1987 (52 FR 41966), proposed substantially identical regulationscontaining only those variations necessary to accommodate their own regulatoryand organizational systems. The intent of CEBA was to provide agricultural banks with added time towork out problems brought about by the extended downturn in the agriculturalindustry. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments Received </ITAG>Eight comments were received on the temporary rule. Comments were receivedfrom three banks, three banks trade associations (two national and onestate-level), one law firm, and one Congressman. Comments were supportiveof agricultural loan loss amortization, while suggesting that the OCC liberalizecertain of the provisions in the temporary rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Comments </ITAG>The OCC received comments regarding the following specific items: <ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of ``Agricultural Bank'' </ITAG>Section 35.2(a) of the rule defines an agricultural bank as any bank: (1)With FDIC insured deposits; (2) located in an area of the country withan economy dependent on agriculture; (3) with total assets of $100 millionor less; and (4) with at least 25 per cent of its total loans in qualifiedagricultural loans and agriculturally related other property or with lessthan 25 per cent of its total loans in qualified agricultural loans andagriculturally related other property but which the OCC still recommendsto the FDIC as eligible. Identification of Agricultural Areas Some commenters urged that the OCC list specific criteria to identify agriculturalareas. The OCC believes that the normal means of identifying agriculturalareas_income levels, revenue flows, acreage in production_are abnormallydepressed due to the current state of the agricultural economy. Adoptinga list of acceptable counties or geographic regions could leave the erroneousimpression that a bank located outside such an area could not qualify eventhough it met the other requirements of an ``agricultural bank''. Additionally,the relatively low level of farm income compared to other income couldartificially mask local areas that traditionally are dependent upon agriculturebut currently have a depressed level of income from agriculture.Consequently, each application should include a description of the bank'slocation, dominant lines of commerce in its service area, and any otherinformation to support the bank's belief that it is located in an agriculturalarea. This information will be used to insure that no bank qualified forparticipation will be excluded due to arbitrary geographic demarcation.Bank SizeThe definition of an agricultural bank includes the statutory requirementthat the bank have total assets of $100 million or less. Comments werereceived by the other federal regulators asking for clarification as towhat happens if a bank is approved for loss deferral and subsequently exceedsthe size limitation. Congress did not intend for banks larger than $100million to defer loan losses. If size was unimportant, the law could haveeasily excluded it as a factor.At the same time, it is of little value for a bank to defer a loss oneyear if it must reverse that deferral the next year because it grew toover $100 million in assets. Therefore, the OCC expects a bank to meetthe definition of an agricultural bank, including the size limitation,upon initial application and as of every quarter that new agriculturallosses are to be deferred. Any loss that was properly deferred initially,will be allowed to be fully amortized according to the regulation, regardlessof a subsequent increase in the bank's size. However, if a bank exceedsthe size limitation, new losses experienced in each quarter that the bankexceeds the size limitation may not be amortized.MergersThe OCC does not intend to allow banks to bypass the application/reviewprocess via a merger with another bank which has already been approved.Such mergers are not expected to be frequent. Therefore, the permissibilityof loss deferral subsequent to a merger will be determined on a case-by-casebasis. This issue should be discussed with representatives of the appropriatesupervisory office and a determination made before a merger transactionis consummated.Percentage of Agricultural LoansTwo commenters urged that the OCC be liberal when determining whether abank meets the 25 per cent test. Prudent banks may have charged off substantialamounts of such loans but, due to the depressed agricultural economy, maynot have been able to replace such loans with new agricultural loans. Acommenter suggested that a bank should satisfy the test if, at any timesince December 31, 1983, it met the requirements.The OCC does not believe such a change is necessary since the 25 per centtest is not an absolute requirement, as it may be waived in some instances.Factors such as depressed collateral value or lack of prudent agriculturallending opportunities will be considered when applications for loan lossamortization are reviewed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of ``Qualified Agricultural Loan''</ITAG>Under section 801 of Title VIII of the CEBA,<ITAG tagnum="20">the term ``qualified agricultural loan'' means a loan made to financethe production of agricultural products or livestock in the United States,a loan secured by farmland or farm machinery, or such other category ofloans as the appropriate Federal banking agency may deem eligible.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 35.2(b) of the temporary rule defines a qualified agriculturalloan to include any loan qualifiying as ``loans to finance agriculturalproduction and other loans to farmers'' or as ``loans secured by farm land''for purposes of Schedule RC-C of the FFIEC Consolidated Reports of Conditionand Income (``Call Report''). The term also includes other loans and leasesthat the applying bank proves to be sufficiently related to agricultureto qualify in the opinion of the OCC. These Call Report definitions arevirtually identical to those contained in Title VIII of the CEBA but aremore comprehensive and permit the agencies to use the Call Reports as thepredominant monitoring device for the amortization program. Several commenterssuggested that the OCC specifically mention particular types of loans inthis definition.The OCC initially saw no reason to repeat the definition in the statutewhen the regulatory definition was of a more descriptive nature and referredto Call Report terms with which banks are familiar. Additionally, as suggestedby Title VIII of the CEBA, the OCC retained discretion to deem other typesof loans and leases to be ``qualified'' and to recommend them to the FDICas eligible if the requesting bank demonstrates those assets to be sufficientlyrelated to agriculture.To clarify that the regulatory definition of ``qualified agricultural loan''is as broad as the statutory definition and is not intended to limit thetypes of loans which a national bank may include in an application, thefinal rule includes farm machinery loans in the regulatory definition.Bankers should refer to the ``Line Item Instructions'' for Schedule RC-Cof the Call Report for an indication of the other types of loans that qualifyfor amortization. For example, qualified agricultural loans include loansreported under line item 1(b)_loans secured by farmland (land known tobe used or usable for agricultural purposes, such as crop and stock production,grazing or pasture land whether tillable or not and whether wooded or not).Similarly, loans reported under line item 3 qualify. These loans includeloans to finance agricultural production (such as for growing or sortingcrops, or breeding, raising, fattening, or marketing livestock), or forpurchases of farm machinery, equipment, or implements.The Call Report definitions are not exclusive descriptions of eligibleloans. If a bank believes that a loan was made for an agricultural purpose,it may apply to amortize a loss on it even though the loan was not reportedon the Call Report as an agricultural loan. The OCC will determine on acase-by-case basis whether a particular loan qualifies.Inclusion of Charge-offs in Loan Volume TestsA commenter suggested that banks be permitted to include charged-off agriculturalloans and agriculturally related other property acquired through foreclosurefor purposes of the loan volume tests. The temporary rule allowed the useof charged-off loans by virtue of including them in the definition of ``qualifiedagricultural loans''. These loans are still assets of the banks, even thoughoff the books, and represent part of the banks' total credit commitmentto agriculture. A similar argument applies to assets acquired through foreclosureon agricultural loans. Therefore, the OCC has included such assets in determiningcompliance with the loan volume tests in the rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amortization</ITAG>Section 35.3(b) of the rule provides that amortization of each qualifiedagricultural loan be computed over a period not to exceed seven years ona quarterly, straight-line basis commencing with the first quarter afterthe charge-off, so that each loan is fully amortized by December 31, 1998.Thus, loans written off in accounting periods ending prior to the adoptionof the rule can be amortized <T3>pro rata</T3> beginning with the Call Report for December 31, 1987.Several commenters suggested that the bank, rather than the OCC, decidewhether to use the full seven-year amortization period. One commenter alsobelieves that adopting the <T3>pro rata</T3> treatment of loans written down prior to adoption ofthe rule unfairly penalizes banks that were diligent in adjusting theirassets.Under the temporary and final rule, a bank that wishes to use an amortizationschedule shorter than the maximum seven years can apply to do so. The OCCanticipates that a seven-year schedule will be the normal schedule, buthas not required its use. The OCC's decision to permit the use of a shorteramortization period depends upon the applicant bank's financial positionand is not likely to require consideration of any extraordinary issues.With regard to adopting a <T3>pro rata</T3> treatment of loans written down prior to adoption ofthe rule, the OCC does not believe banks that were diligent in adjustingtheir assets are penalized. The technique prescribed reflects amortizationsas though the program had been in effect from the first year deferral wasallowed. Amortization in this manner does reduce the initial amount ofdeferred losses which can be established, but it also reduces the futureamortizations which must be absorbed. The OCC does not view this as a penalty.Furthermore, accepted banking practice and Call Report instructions requirebanks to record a loss in the period it becomes apparent. Banks which hadlosses, but declined to recognize them, would have been in contraventionof proper procedures. Therefore, differences in the actual occurrence ofan economic loss should be a much greater cause of different timing patternsin loan charge-offs than differences in how quickly management elects totake a loss.<ITAG tagnum="84">Losses Due to Agriculturally Related Real Estate Sales or Reappraisals</ITAG>Section 35.3(a)(2) of the temporary rule allows a bank to amortize anyloss reflected in its financial statements resulting from a reappraisalor sale of real or personal property it acquired in connection with a qualifiedagricultural loan owned on January 1, 1983, and still held on November9, 1987, and of any additional property acquired on or before December31, 1991.Several commenters objected to the requirement that such property had tobe held on November 9, 1987, in order for any losses to be eligible foramortizing. Commenters pointed out that neither the statute nor its legislativehistory explicitly calls for ownership of such property on the effectivedate of the regulation. The commenters suggested that better referencedates might be the date the loss was actually recognized or the date thelegislation was introduced, passed both houses of Congress, or signed.One commenter suggested that any loss on such property be treated in thesame manner as a loss on the loan it secured, that is, amortization shouldbe allowed at least beginning with the date the loss was recognized solong as the loss is otherwise an eligible loss.The OCC agrees that losses attributable to property, acquired as the resultof agricultural lending, are as much a part of the bank's agriculturalproblem as the original loan loss. The intent of the legislation is tomitigate the immediate effect of those losses. Therefore, the final ruleprovides that losses on holding or selling property will be treated inthe same manner as losses on agricultural loans. This change is the onlysubstantive change in the final rule.Furthermore, CEBA allows amortization for agricultural loan losses thatwould be reflected on annual financial statements for 1984-1991. It alsoallows amortization for losses resulting from reappraisals on agriculturallyrelated other property. To ensure that losses due to reappraisals are treatedcomparably to loan losses, the regulation requires that losses from reappraisalsthat the bank would be required to reflect on financial statements for1983-1991 be amortized within seven years in the same manner as agriculturalloan losses generally, <T3>i.e.,</T3> they must be fully amortized by 1998. For the same reason,the regulation provides that losses resulting from reappraisals after 1991are not eligible for amortization.<ITAG tagnum="84">``In need of Capital Restoration''</ITAG>The language in the statute and legislative history of the provision indicatethat Congress intended that only banks with capital in need of restorationbe permitted to amortize losses. Further, it intended that only banks withreasonable prospects for survival be permitted to amortize losses. Section35.5(b) provides that, (1) the current capital of a bank wishing to amortizequalifying losses must be in need of restoration, and (2) the bank mustalso be an economically viable, fundamentally sound institution. Theseare certainly not mutually exclusive conditions. A bank can have inadequatecapital due to a variety of temporary problems or conditions yet also haveenough underlying demand for banking services and earning capacity to restorecapital if given sufficient time.Several commenters suggested that this section is too restrictive and thatany bank qualifying as an agricultural bank which has qualifying agriculturallosses should be able to amortize those losses to restore capital to somehigher level even if it is not ``in need of'' capital restoration for regulatorypurposes. The OCC believes most agricultural banks have strong capital positionsand no need for loss deferral. The OCC further believes that Congress didnot intend for these techniques to be used to artificially maintain unnecessarilyhigh levels of capital. Congressional intent seems clear in that the statuterequired, as an essential condition of eligibility, the submission of ``aplan to restore its capital * * * to a level'' acceptable to the OCC. Ifcapital is to be restored to an acceptable level it must, by definition,not already be at an acceptable level. Nevertheless, whether a particular bank is ``in need of'' capital restorationdepends on its particular circumstances. Thus, a bank might be deemed ``inneed of'' capital restoration even though its capital ratio equals or exceedsthe minimum capital levels prescribed by 12 CFR Part 3. Because the OCCwill make the determination of need in each case, a bank applying to amortizeagricultural loans should include a statement as to why it is ``in needof'' capital restoration. Economically Viable and Fundamentally Sound A commenter suggested that the requirement that a bank must be economicallyviable and fundamentally sound to be eligible is unnecessary. The OCC believesthat no purpose would be served by allowing a non-viable and hopelesslyunsound institution to temporarily avoid insolvency through the use ofthis accounting adjustment. The legislative history of the statute supportsthis interpretation. A commenter also expressed concern over the conditions surrounding removalof a bank from the program once it has recovered financially. The OCC doesnot intend, as a matter of administrative practice, to remove a bank fromthe program so long as the bank continues to meet the Conditions on Acceptanceprescribed in the regulation. Therefore, once a loss has been deferreda bank may continue to amortize it. However, once the bank has recoveredsufficiently to no longer meet the eligibility requirements, because itis no longer ``in need of'' capital restoration, no new losses will bepermitted to be deferred. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Issues </ITAG>Evidence of Fraud Several commenters suggested that the regulation clarify what constitutesevidence of fraud that would disqualify a loss from amortization. The OCC decided not to list elements constituting fraud in the regulation.Some indicia might include criminal referral reports, for example, butthe lack of such a report will not preclude excluding a loan if evidenceof fraud exists. Normal sources of information used to determine whetherfraud is present should include information collected in the examinationprocess, as well. The OCC will use a case-by-case approach and will allowan applying bank an opportunity to explain ambiguous circumstances. CEO Certification The temporary rule required a certification by the bank's chief executiveofficer that there is no evidence that the losses resulted from fraud orcriminal abuse. One commenter expressed concern over this requirement,in that it is not generally possible to be absolutely certain of everycircumstance surrounding every loan. The OCC understands this reluctance and therefore a specific form of certificationwas not dictated in the temporary or final regulation. A certificationto the best of one's knowledge and belief was and is permissible. Reference to Enforcement Proceedings Several commenters suggested removing references to enforcement proceedingsfrom the regulation. The presence of such references affirms that preexistingconditions or problems typically requiring correction by an enforcementaction will be monitored and managed. Such references will not normallycreate information requirements or performance obligations not alreadyexisting. Accordingly, the references are retained in the final rule. Compensation Levels Several commenters also suggested removing references to compensation levelsfrom the regulation. Compensation levels are typically an integral partof a capital plan. As with enforcement actions, the presence of such referencesin the rule only affirms that the program will be managed and monitored.Legal Lending Limit A commenter expressed concern over the interrelationship between 12 CFR32.8 and the agricultural loan loss amortization program. Banks will bepermitted to use the restated capital under this regulation for purposesof computing their regular legal lending limit under andSection; 32.3. However,the OCC believes it would be inappropriate to permit a bank to includelosses recapitalized under the amortization program is computing its substitutelending limit under andSection; 32.8, because that would effectively givesuch losses double weight. In many cases, this would result in a legallending limit far greater than the bank would have had if it had not sufferedthe agricultural losses. Accordingly, while a bank participating in theloan loss deferral program may calculate its lending limit under eithersection, the calculation of capital and surplus for purposes of the alternativelending limit under andSection; 32.8 must be made without reference to therecapitalized unamortized losses permitted under this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3(g)(1) of Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981,it has been determined that this final rule does not constitute a ``majorrule'' within the meaning of the executive order. Consequently, no regulatoryimpact analysis is necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354,5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the OCC certifies that this final rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collection of information requirements contained in this final rulehave been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budgetunder section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act.
