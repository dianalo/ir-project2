Joint-custody agreements, in which divorced parents sharecustody of their children, became increasingly popularthroughout the 1980s. But many of these pacts are nowdissolving, and new studies suggest that early enthusiasm forsuch arrangements was misguided.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Joint custody was going to be a great panacea, theultimate solution,&quot; says Gary N. Skoloff, chairman of theAmerican Bar Association's family law section. &quot;Lawyers,mediators, judges -- everyone said this was the way to savethe children. But it turned out to be the world's worstsituation. It was an experiment that failed.&quot;   Robert Mnookin, director of the Stanford Center onConflict and Mediation, which conducted a child-custody studyof 1,100 families in California, says, &quot;Where parents arefighting and remain locked in conflict, joint physicalcustody can be like carrying out King Solomon's threat. Achild can be torn apart psychologically.&quot;   Few nationwide statistics on custody arrangements areavailable. Researchers estimate that the proportion ofdivorce cases settled with joint physical custody, in whichchildren alternate between the parents' residences, rangesfrom 3% in Massachusetts to 18% in California. Joint legalcustody -- in which children have a single home but, incontrast to sole custody, the parents share responsibilityfor making important decisions -- is granted in up to 80% ofdivorce cases.   But these numbers may represent a peak. &quot;Social-sciencedata in the past five years has started to question theapplicability of joint custody, especially when the parentsare battling,&quot; says Amy Koel, director of the MiddlesexDivorce Research Group in Cambridge, Mass., which studieddivorce cases in the area. &quot;It's too early to say whether thecourts will change, but they do seem responsive to thenational mood&quot; of skepticism toward joint custody.   The theory behind joint custody was simple: Judges wouldno longer have to choose between parents, families would nolonger have to endure bitter court battles, and childrenwould no longer feel that their non-custodial parents werevisitors in their lives. Experts believed joint-custodyarrangements would reduce litigation time and encourageparental cooperation.   But a study of 700 divorce cases in Cambridge by theMiddlesex Divorce Research Group found that couples withjoint legal custody were more than twice as likely torelitigate their child-care agreements as couples with solecustody.   Moreover, joint legal custody &quot;makes no difference interms of the amount of parents' contact with their kids, thequality of communication between parents, or the rate ofcompliance with child-support payments,&quot; says Stanford's Mr.Mnookin.   Researchers say joint custody hasn't lived up to itspromise because most parents haven't embraced the conceptwillingly. When joint custody was introduced, only the mostdedicated, cooperative parents requested it -- and they weredetermined to make the novel arrangement work. Initialsuccesses prompted lawyers, judges and mediators to pushother parents to try joint custody -- and even to impose iton unwilling couples.   Within a few years, many of these nonvoluntary settlementscollapsed. &quot;The willingness to share hasn't struck a chord inAmerica,&quot; says Judith S. Wallerstein, a psychologist anddirector of the Center for the Family in Transition in CorteMadera, Calif.   Imposed joint custody is common both in and out of court.The Cambridge study found that judges rejected more thanone-third of fathers' and one-fifth of mothers' requests forsole custody. In all these cases (which include situationswhere one parent requested joint and the other demandedsole), the court mandated joint custody.   In California, where most divorce cases are settled withmediators out of court, the Stanford study similarly foundthat 30% of the mothers and 38% of the fathers who requestedsole custody were denied it. Even when both parents agreed onwho should have sole custody, mediators pushed them intojoint custody in 5% of the cases, the study found.   &quot;Lawyers aren't trained to sit down with parents andevaluate what will be best for a child they've never seen,&quot;says Ms. Wallerstein. &quot;They're more likely to discusseconomic and legal issues, and they will make recommendationsto their clients based on what the court might favor&quot; --which often means joint custody.   Some states, including Minnesota and Missouri, haverecently passed laws advocating joint custody. But severalstates with joint-custody experience are moving the otherway. Massachusetts, Utah and California, a leader in thejoint-custody movement in the early 1980s, recently revokedstatutes favoring joint custody. Courts in Florida and SouthCarolina decided in 1989 that joint custody should only beconsidered under exceptional circumstances because it doesn'tprovide a stable home environment.   Even when both parents request joint custody, it can causebig problems. &quot;My daughter can't eat, sleep or get her workdone when she has to switch homes,&quot; says Anita Brazer, a40-year-old homemaker from Lake Forest, Ill., &quot;because she'sso worried about whether everything will be packed, whethershe'll remember to bring the English paper she's working on,whether she'll have the right supplies for her art project.&quot;   Joint decision making has proved difficult for theparents. Says Ms. Brazer: &quot;We fight about every littlenitpicky thing, from whether Chad should go to school for afull day or a half day to whether Erika should be allowed tochew gum.&quot;   The father, Skip Brazer, agrees that the currentarrangement, in which the two children spend four-dayweekends with him every other week plus dinner once or twicea week, is tough on them: &quot;It's hello, goodbye, hello,goodbye all the time,&quot; he says. A 42-year-old salesman inLibertyville, Ill., he has proposed that the children spendalternate weeks with each parent. &quot;With longer blocks oftime, they wouldn't bounce around so much,&quot; he says.   Ms. Brazer, however, wants to spend more time with herchildren, not less. The couple will go to mediation nextmonth in an attempt to modify the custody arrangement for thethird time in two years.   Some joint-custody arrangements survive, but with muchstress and strain. Carl Belcher, a 43-year-old engineer fromColumbia, Md., found joint custody worked best when he andhis former wife ignored &quot;nitty-gritty details&quot; outlined inlegal documents about such things as the exact times eachparent would pick up the children and who would pay forclothing. &quot;Instead, we worked hard to make sure the kidswouldn't suffer,&quot; he says.   Mr. Belcher's joint-custody pact has survived 10 years,largely because he and his ex-wife have remained flexibleabout visitation. His daughter, now 18, has had troubleadjusting to the joint parenting and attends counseling atthe Children of Separation and Divorce Center in Columbia.But overall, he says, the arrangement has worked: &quot;I wouldnot have left the marriage under any other circumstances.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
