The warning, from the department's Minerals Management Service, drew attention to possible logistical problems in reactivating the dozens of mammoth offshore drillings rigs that have been &quot;stacked,&quot; or placed in storage, along the Gulf Coast during the oil industry's severe drilling slump. Any shortage of active drilling rigs could increase long-depressed contract rates and provide some desperately needed relief for drilling contractors, industry analysts said.    Hard-pressed contractors have long hoped that oil producers will choose to drill on hundreds of unexplored leases in the Gulf of Mexico, thereby keeping the leases from expiring. About 75 unexplored leases are due to expire at the end of this year, and an additional 737 are to expire in 1988. While some of the leases already have been judged to be poor exploratory prospects, drilling contractors hope their business will swell as higher energy prices and imminent lease deadlines prod oil companies into action.    &quot;The arithmetic is there,&quot; said C.R. Palmer, chairman of Rowan Cos., a major offshore driller. &quot;They are going to have to move in a timely fashion to get all their leases tested.&quot;    William D. Bettenberg, director of the Minerals Management Service, bolstered the drillers' case in a recent letter to oil companies. In the letter, he insisted that the government will refuse to accept a shortage of drilling rigs as a valid reason to extend the terms of any offshore leases.    &quot;Unnecessary delays in drilling may result in expiration of leases,&quot; the letter said. &quot;The low number of available operating rigs, and the high number of undrilled leases, could result in a shortage of drilling rigs in the near future.&quot;    While current offshore drilling activity remains drastically below peak levels of a few years ago, utilization rates have begun to recover from last year's lows. Offshore Data Services Inc. said yesterday that 48.1% of the Gulf of Mexico fleet is at work, compared with only 25.4% a year ago. Bolstered by higher oil prices, onshore exploration is increasing, too; the Baker Hughes Inc. count of U.S. land rigs operating jumped by 56 rigs, to 973, last week, compared with 721 a year earlier.    Ripple effects of the offshore upturn have already reached some of the drillers' own suppliers. On Friday, Varco International Inc. of Orange, Calif., received seven orders for a $700,000 piece of drilling hardware from offshore contractors upgrading their rigs. The orders brought to 15 the number of the systems sold by Varco last month, nearly double the number of sales recorded by the company in the entire second quarter.    &quot;This thing is for real,&quot; said Kenneth S. Miller, an oil field services analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers. &quot;We think drilling activity is going to be higher than the Wall Street consensus.&quot; If oil companies heed the warnings about expiring oil leases, Mr. Miller says, the available Gulf of Mexico fleet could be almost fully contracted within the next six to 12 months. Less optimistic analysts still expect activity to increase close to 50% by the end of this year.    Even though they can't become active on a momnent's notice, the legion of rigs sitting idle in Gulf Coast waters continues to hang over the market. &quot;One of the main problems isn't the level of work -- it's the oversupply of rigs,&quot; said Michael Simmons, president of Loosbrock Offshore International, a Houston company that advises investors who want to purchase offshore drilling rigs. He noted that while contract rates have improved to slightly above break-even cash costs, they still remain about 75% below the rates of the early 1980s.    Mr. Palmer of Rowan Cos. said contract rates for jack-up type rigs have increased to between $8,000 and $15,000 a day -- still very low, but up from between $6,500 and $9,000 earlier this year. Despite the low day rates, Rowan has maintained a strategy of keeping its rigs active and doesn't have a rig available for six weeks, Mr. Palmer said.    A major uncertainty in the Gulf of Mexico is the future of natural gas prices, which haven't yet climbed as quickly as oil prices. However, Earl A. Stolz Jr., an oil field services analyst with Howard Weil Labouisee Friedrichs in New Orleans, noted that leases explored now won't be fully develped for another three to five years. &quot;Even by the most bearish estimates, gas prices ought to be up nicely by then,&quot; he said.    But after three years of depressed business, many offshore vendors remain hesitant to proclaim that a turnaround is at hand. Despite Varco's banner day for orders last Friday, Richard Kerston, vice president of finance, said that &quot;after what's happened in this industry, we're not eager to predict what the business will do in the future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
