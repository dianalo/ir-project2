 Mismanagement isusually the common denominator in such failures.andP;  The fact is thatsystems development projects are no different from any otherproject category.andP;  The same management principles apply to thedevelopment of an applications system that apply to the buildingof a bridge.andP;  The project plan should include precise andcomprehensive estimates, tasks should be scaled down to smallermodules of time and material if possible (the so-called 80-hourrule), project milestones should be utilized to assure phasecompletion, the overall project plan should be as complete aspossible and post implementation reviews should be instituted.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Project ManagementComputer IndustrySystem DevelopmentManagement ConsultingMismanagement.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Managing projects effectively: it's no easy taskandM;The computer industry is rife with stories of projects gone astray: systemsdevelopment projects being cancelled after millions have been spent; expectedproject completion dates being extended again and again, possibly due toinaccurate or incomplete estimating; and news of lawsuits resulting fromprojects which have spun out of control.andM;It has been noted that if we constructed highrise buildings the same way weconstruct applications systems, we would probably still live and work insingle level structures.andP;  In many cases, we can point to poor projectmanagement as a major reason why the project failed.andP;  While effective projectmanagement may not be the only answer to solving these problems, it iscertainly one of the most important components for completing projects onschedule and within budget.andM;All too frequently, systems development projects are incorrectly viewed asbeing different from other kinds of projects.andP;  For example, a project toconstruct a bridge has many similarities with a project to construct anapplications system -- both projects should have a project plan, designdocuments, testing criteria and certainly a project budget managed by aproject manager.andM;The primary difference is that you can touch and feel a bridge, while acomputer application is a little more esoteric.andM;Suggested techniquesandM;The point is, however, that all projects require project management, whetherthe result of the project is something tangible (like a bridge), or somethingintangible (like an applications system).andM;System development projects should not be treated differently than otherprojects: they should be subject to the same level of rigorous projectmanagement in order to ensure delivery of a functional product on time andwithin budget.andM;The following are some of the techniques to ensure effective projectmanagement:andM;* the Project Plan, including accurate and complete estimates;andM;* tasks designed with the '80-Hour Rule';andM;* project milestone':andM;* management against the project plan; and,andM;* post implementation reviews.andM;First and foremost, a project plan is a necessity.andP;  The foundation of allgood project plans is accurate and complete estimates of tasks.andP;  The projectplan should be devised in such a way that individual tasks take no longerthan 80 hours (this is known as the '80-Hour Rule'), and each phase shouldhave a least one deliverable.andP;  The reason for the 80-hour rule is thatprojects are much easier to manage in 'bite size' chunks.andM;In addition, it is much easier to back away from, or declare unsuccessful, an80-hour task than it is to walk away from a three-month task.andP;  Anotherbenefit to keeping tasks small, and providing deliverables, is the ease ofdetermining task completion -- it should be much easier to determine whetheran 80-hour task is complete, such as 'Design Aged Accounts ReceivableReport', rather than determine whether a 500-hour phase 'Design AccountsReceivable System' is complete.andM;The plan should be structured such that groups of individual tasks compriseproject phases, or sub-phases for larger projects.andP;  The larger the project,the more phases, sub-phases and tasks.andM;Another useful technique is to place project milestones, or formal reviewpoints, at logical points throughout the project.andP;  The purpose of thesemilestones is to ensure completion and user acceptance prior to beginning thenext phase.andM;For example, it is customary to place project milestones at the end of thedesign phase, and again just prior to implementation.andP;  Some larger projectswill have milestones upon design completion of sub-systems (e.g.andP;  completionof Accounts Payable design, completion of Accounts Receivable design, andcompletion of General Ledger design.)andM;Use milestonesandM;It is important to ensure that there is a corresponding deliverable (ordeliverables) for each project milestone.andP;  Since the primary purpose of themilestone is to ensure phase completion and user acceptance, it makes senseto have a deliverable to review.andM;Through placing milestones in the project, and through limiting the size ofindividual tasks, we will ensure that problems or areas of concern will bedetected during the course of the project (when they can be properly dealtwith), instead of being detected at the end of the failed project--if at all.andM;The best project plan conceivable will be of no use if it is not followedclosely.andP;  For this reason, strict adherence to the plan is recommended.andP;  Withthis in mind, it is important to ensure the project plan is complete,contains all the necessary tasks, and is accurately estimated.andM;A plan is not much use if, for example, the implementation phase ismistakenly omitted, or phases are grossly under-estimated.andM;In many cases, the project manager will be under pressure to revise theproject plan.andP;  It is the responsibility of the project manager to minimizeunnecessary changes; ensure that only critical changes are incorporated intoa revised plan, while understanding that revised plans also mean revisedbudgets and revised schedules.andM;One effective technique for controlling changes to approved plans is tointroduce a 'Change Control' document, which will formalize the process ofchanging plans.andP;  The 'Change Control' document should identify the changerequested, plus contain areas for estimated time and budget impacts of thechange, and whether the change is required or simply desired.andM;By simply formalizing the process of changing plans, the project manager caneliminate unnecessary or cosmetic changes to project plans.andM;An often overlooked task in effective project management is the postimplementation review.andP;  Too often, post implementation reviews are viewedwith some hostility as a finger-pointing or recriminations exercise.andM;But the major purpose of the post implementation review is simply to try andlearn from our mistakes: how could we have done this more effectively?andP;  Wasthere anything we did or could have done to complete this project with lesseffort or in a more timely manner?andM;By conducting the post implementation review, the effective project managerwill learn what to do (or what not to do) to make the next project run moreeasily.andM;Increased successandM;In summary, many failed systems projects suffer from a variety of poorproject management techniques, but most especially poor or incomplete projectestimating.andM;Some useful techniques in successful project management are: devise a projectplan, use tasks designed with the '80-Hour Rule', include project milestonesat key review points in the project, manage the project rigorously againstthe project plan, and always conduct post implementation reviews upon projectcompletion.andM;By applying these few simple rules, the project manager will vastly increasethe likelihood of successful project completion on time and within budget.andM;Tom Caldwell is a senior consultant with Price Waterhouse, managementconsultants.andP;  He has over 10 years of experience in managing projects.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
