Federal regulators closed, merged or otherwise &quot;resolved&quot;223 dead thrifts in 1988, many in last-gasp deals throwntogether in the final days of the year. However, largelybecause of regulators' own miscalculations and blunders, theydidn't give sufficient money in many cases. So far, three ofthe 1988 deals have collapsed because of the failure of theacquiring thrifts -- Southwest Savings andamp; Loan of Dallas,Merabank Federal Savings Bank, Phoenix, and Statesman Bankfor Savings, Des Moines, Iowa. Several others are tottering.</LP><TEXT>   These twice-failed thrifts make for one of the moreegregious aspects of the thrift debacle. While it appearsthat wily financiers may have fleeced the government in ahandful of deals, much more costly to taxpayers is the factthat many of the regulators' &quot;resolutions&quot; actually resolvednothing and will have to be bailed out anew, adding needlessbillions to the ultimate taxpayer tab.   Consider Pelican Homestead andamp; Savings Association, ofMetairie, La. When it acquired four dead thrifts in late1987, it was touted by Danny Wall, then chairman of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, as the model for the 1988 dealsthat would follow, in which &quot;strong&quot; institutions would takeover basket cases. The Bank Board projected that Pelicanwould become profitable in a few years.   Pelican was indeed a model -- for disaster. It wasinsolvent by at least $86 million before the deal, had lossesof $39.4 million in 1988 and $64.3 million in 1989, andcontinues to hemorrhage.   Robert Shofstahl, Pelican's president, says it didn't getsome of the federal guarantees later acquirers received, suchas an assured profit margin on bad assets of acquiredthrifts. Mr. Shofstahl says the institutions that Pelicanacquired were in far worse shape than he or regulatorsexpected. Pelican is seeking a new rescue package under aprogram offering aid to well-run institutions in economicallydepressed regions. A new Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.audit now pegs Pelican's cost to taxpayers at a minimum of$589 million over the next decade.   The Bank Board ignored warnings from its own regulatorsthat some of the deals were fatally flawed. For example,according to past and present regulators, James Cirona,president of the Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco, andhis staff repeatedly urged Mr. Wall not to proceed with aplan to permit gravely ill Merabank Federal Savings Bank toacquire several insolvent Texas thrifts. Mr. Wall may havebeen influenced by an agreement with Merabank's parent,Pinnacle West Capital Corp., under which the parent wassupposed to &quot;make good&quot; Merabank's losses.   The deal was completed, and Merabank soon collapsed frommassive losses in Arizona real estate. Pinnacle West, ineffect, reneged on the make-good agreement but later agreedto a settlement that only pared the government's huge loss,now estimated at $1.5 billion by the FDIC.   Similarly, the Bank Board folded four broke thrifts intoSouthwest Savings andamp; Loan, which was owned by a trust forCaroline Rose Hunt, of Dallas's once-rich Hunt family. Theboard provided $2 billion of notes and other assistance butrequired no new real capital, even though Southwest Savingsitself was going broke. Instead, in a move that baffled evensome regulators at the time, the board allowed Ms. Hunt toconvert $25 million of Southwest Savings' debt into stock andcount that as equity. But the debt was worthless to beginwith because of Southwest Savings' own losses.   Mr. Wall now says he wanted the thrift to convert the debtto equity because the debt was requiring payments that hesays were depleting Southwest Savings' capital. ThoughTexas's real estate problems were obvious by then to many inthe land and lending businesses, Mr. Wall maintains thatregulators didn't know how imperiled Southwest Savings reallywas at the time. &quot;In hindsight, we shouldn't have done thatconversion,&quot; he concedes.   Despite $541.6 million of government assistance through1989, Southwest Savings' net losses have roared on, to thetune of $238.5 million in 1988 and 1989. It has died twice:Regulators closed it in June and are looking for a buyer.Future projected costs of Southwest Savings: $5.6 billion.   Perhaps the most mysterious of the 1988 deals is SunbeltSavings Association of Dallas, which had failed spectacularlyamid allegations of fraud that led to the recent indictment,in Dallas federal court, of its former chairman, Ed McBirney.His trial is pending. In late 1988, regulators took theremains of Sunbelt, lumped them with the detritus of fourother blownout Texas thrifts and pronounced the resultingentity, rechristened Sunbelt Savings FSB, &quot;stabilized.&quot; Inreality, that meant unsaleable, so regulators installed a newmanagement team to cleanse Sunbelt of the high-cost depositsthat were scaring off prospective suitors. Regulators refusedto disclose how much this process would cost, although theamount was rumored to be $700 million.   To date, Sunbelt remains a spinster. And the FDIC auditshows that its losses are vastly larger than originallyanticipated. The government spent $891.7 million on Sunbeltthrough 1989 and estimates that it will spend $9.4 billionmore through 1998. Since that estimate, moreover, two othercollapsed Texas thrifts have been lobbed onto the Sunbeltpile. Their losses suggest Sunbelt ultimately will cost some$12 billion, a tad less than Peru's foreign debt.</TEXT></DOC>
