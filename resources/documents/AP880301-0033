The agency on Monday sent to Congress a report calling forstepped-up research, training and enforcement on the problems ofasbestos in non-school buildings, but no new regulatoryrequirements.   ``The successful implementation of the school program shouldremain our first concern, and we all have much to learn from it,''wrote EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas in his cover letter toCongress. ``I fear a major initiative in other buildings could domore harm that good.''   John A. Moore, assistant administrator for pesticides and toxicsubstances, said at a news conference that the agency is hamperedby limited resources.   The report dealt with so-called ``friable'' asbestos, which willcrumble under slight pressure and throw fibers into the air. Thefibers can cause lung cancer, cancer of the lining of the chest orabdominal cavity and asbestosis.   Asbestos-containing material that is damaged, such as insulatedpipe wrappings and tiles, can release the fibers.   The Service Employees International Union said EPA should bewriting regulations or seeking legislation to give those workersthe right to know what they're dealing with. The union has 150,000of its 850,000 members in building service jobs.   The agency's report contained new information about astill-unreleased survey of 43 federal buildings containing friableasbestos.   Despite the condition of the asbestos, the average concentrationin the air of the buildings was 560 fibers per cubic yard, about0.4 percent of the workplace concentration permitted by theOccupational Safety and Health Administration.   That concentration is about 10 times the typical outdoorbackground level, and EPA said such a difference from backgroundcould be the result of chance alone _ that the buildings might notbe significantly contaminated at all.   The report also contained old and new information from a 1984EPA survey of 231 buildings, a survey designed to be representativeof some 3.6 million buildings to which the public has access.Elementary and secondary schools, state and local governmentbuildings and apartments with fewer than 10 units were excluded.   The old information, reported in 1985, was that an estimated 20percent of buildings contained friable asbestos. The newinformation further broke down that estimate to show that 14percent of the buildings contain damaged friable asbestos. Thatcategory was further broken down to show that 9 percent of thebuildings had seriously damaged asbestos.   EPA said too few buildings were sampled for the figures to beprecise.   EPA said the 20 percent likely could be anywhere from 14 percentto 27 percent; the 14 percent could be anywhere from 6 percent to22 percent; and the 9 percent could be zero to 19 percent.   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., whose pressure has helped win passageof existing asbestos-in-schools programs, said in a statement,``Everything in this report points toward aggressive federalintervention except EPA's recommendations, which amount to nothingmore than sweeping this alarming problem under the rug.''   The agency has said about 35,000 school buildings, roughly 35percent of the total, contained friable asbestos in 1984. Under newEPA regulations required by Congress school districts must developasbestos management plans, with the advice of certified experts, byOctober 1988 and start carrying them out in July 1989.   EPA said the school program will cost $3 billion, and acomparable program for buildings to which the public has accesswould cost $51 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
