RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge's ruling in a divorce custody battleover frozen embryos is an aberration not likely to survive onappeal, legal experts say.   But at least for now, they say, the decision may have unforeseenconsequences for fetal research and the technology of fertilizationoutside the mother's womb.   Tennessee Judge W. Dale Young ruled Thursday that ``life beginsat conception'' in awarding temporary custody of seven frozenembryos to a woman who is divorcing her husband.   ``This is just a tragic case,'' said Professor Ellen WrightClayton of Vanderbilt University Law School, an authority onreproductive rights. ``But, yes, I'll say it's an aberration. Nojudge has said this before.''   She added that the Supreme Court, while showing increasinghostility to its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide, is notlikely to hold that life begins at conception.   ``I certainly think (Young's ruling) goes too far even for thisSupreme Court,'' Clayton said. The justices ``have never saidembryos are children.''   A deeply divided Supreme Court, ruling in July in a Missouricase, expanded state power to regulate abortions but stopped shortof overturning its 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade.   In the Tennessee case, Young awarded temporary custody of theembryos to Mary Sue Davis, who wants them implanted in her so shecan bear a child. The judge ruled against her estranged husband,Junior Lewis Davis, who opposed implanting the embryos.   Davis said he will ask the Tennessee Court of Appeals tooverturn Young's ruling.   Young relied heavily on testimony by a French geneticist whosaid each embryo bears the full genetic blueprint of an individual.The judge said the Davises ``have produced human beings ... to beknown as their child or children.''   Abortion opponents welcomed Young's ruling.   ``This ruling reflects what pro-lifers have been saying foryears,'' said Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-LifeCouncil of Connecticut. ``Life begins at conception and should beprotected by the laws of our land.''   But John Robertson, a professor at the University of Texas LawSchool, said Young reached out ``in an unprecedented andunwarranted manner'' to decide the dispute between the Davises onright-to-life grounds.   Clayton said the judge ``was completely bamboozled'' by thegeneticist's testimony. The embryos ``are unique genetically. Butthat doesn't decide the issue,'' she said.   Young could have reached the same result by deciding the case onmuch narrower grounds, the experts say. For example, he could haveruled for Mrs. Davis on grounds she had more to lose. She has saidthis might be her last chance to bear a child.   Young's ruling, hailed by abortion opponents and denounced byabortion rights activists, could mean trouble for the decade-oldtechnology of in-vitro fertilization in which eggs are removed fromthe mother's womb for fertilization and then reimplanted.   In Mrs. Davis' case, nine eggs were surgically removed andattempts to reimplant two of them failed. The remaining sevenfertilized eggs were placed in frozen storage.   That is the typical procedure, since the odds are againstsuccessful pregnancy for any one reimplanted embryo.   Legal experts said the Tennessee ruling raises the question howfrozen embryos are to be disposed of when the woman does becomepregnant and the couple does not wish to have additional children.   Young's ruling could discourage couples from trying in vitrosterilization for fear they would be forced by law to preserve _and implant _ all frozen embryos.   Ironically, Clayton said, the only solution for couples thathave more embryos than they want could be to implant them and thenhave an abortion if the woman becomes pregnant.   Legal authorities also noted that Young's ruling raises problemsfor researchers who use embryos for medical research.   Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights ActionLeague, said, ``Must all frozen embryos now be guaranteedimplantation,'' or will in-vitro fertilization be outlawed?</TEXT></DOC>
