BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Billionaire Harold C. Simmons, who may haveLockheed Corp. in his takeover sights, doesn't mind being called acorporate raider. After all, buying other companies has propelledthe son of two Texas public school teachers to billionaire status.   ``I think that's OK, because that's what I am,'' Simmons told aninterviewer last year. ``I think that term raider is verymisleading because it implies that somebody is taking something byforce without paying for it. Basically, corporate raiders arewilling to pay a price for a stock higher that anyone else iswilling to pay, or else they don't buy it.''   Simmons, 57, last week upped his stake in Lockheed to 5.3percent, but said in a letter to Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of thedefense contractor: ``We have no plans, or desire, to disruptmanagement. We expect to be a constructive, long-term shareholder.''   However, Simmons has made no secret of his plans to get backinto the acquisition game after he has ``digested'' his $1 billionpurchase last year of NL Industries Inc.   ``I'll be looking for an acquisition in the range of $2 billionand upwards,'' Simmons told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram last year.``My philosophy has always been that a big deal is as easy to do asa small deal, so you might as well do the biggest one you can do''_ a philosophy he has repeated several times to variousinterviewers.   Simmons, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Texaswith bachelor's and master's degrees in economics, worked for threeyears as an investigator for the U.S. Civil Service, and then ayear as an examiner at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   Then, in 1956, he moved to Republic National Bank, where heworked for four years before quitting, according to his officialbiography, because ``my bosses and I disagreed on who was thesmarter.''   Simmons, then 29, put down $5,000 of his own money and borrowed$95,000 to buy a drug store across from the Southern MethodistUniversity campus.   ``He has never worked for anyone else since,'' says hisbiography.   ``He made hamburgers, washed dishes, stocked shelves, kept booksand polished the floors,'' the bio says.   He also read financial statements; ``I only know how to do onething well, and that's read a financial statement,'' he said in aninterview in the current issue of Fortune magazine.   In 1966 he began acquiring drug store chains, eventually owning100 stores before selling them in 1973 to Jack Eckerd Corp. for $50million.   Fortune estimates his current holdings in chemical, timber andsugar to be worth about $1.5 billion. He told the magazine, ``Iexpect to be worth $5 billion to $10 billion before I die.''   Besides NL Industries, which he split into a chemical divisionwith $1 billion in 1988 sales and a petroleum services divisionwith $492 in sales, through his totally owned Contran Corp. hecontrols all or most of The Amalgamated Sugar Co., with 1988 salesof $401 million; Medford Corp., $127 million in forest products;Medite Corp., $86 million in fiberboard; Sybra Inc., a largefranchiser of Arby's fast food restaurants with $81 million insales; and the Hardware Division, which sold $59 million in locksand medical products.   Separately, through Contran, he owns 52 percent of KeystoneConsolidated Ind., a steel and wire products company.   In addition, Simmons has made $328.9 million over the pastdecade through the buying and selling of large chunks of companies_ from PSA Inc. to Sea-Land Corp to GAF Corp.   He has given some of it away, the largest chunk a $41 milliongift last year to the University of Texas Southwestern MedicalCenter at Dallas for cancer and arthritis research.   Along the way, he also has had brushes with the law. In the1970s, he was acquitted of mail and securities fraud charges andsettled a civil suit for $500,000.   In 1983, he was found to have violated pension fund managementrules, even though he had increased the value of the pension fund.   Although once described as working 80-hour weeks, Simmons nowspends only about six hours daily at his office on the 17th floorof a north Dallas office building. ``Can't let my job get in theway of my tennis game,'' he says.   ``I'm not a long-hours worker,'' he told a reporter last year.``Two hours of good thinking time a day beats 20 hours of hardwork. From my viewpoint, you've got to come up with the ideas.''   Simmons was born in Alba, Texas, east of Dallas, and grew up innearby Golden, where his father was superintendent of schools andhis mother a teacher in the town of about 200.   His official biography says Simmons was 16 before his parentsand two brothers lived in a house with indoor plumbing.   Now Simmons has two homes in Dallas, a duplex in Aspen and a24-acre villa in Santa Barbara, about 80 miles from Lockheed'sCalabasas, Calif., headquarters _ so near, Simmons told Lockheed'sTellep he would come by for a visit someday soon.</TEXT></DOC>
