Kevin Mitnick, who authorities had described as too dangerous tobe allowed near a telephone alone for fear he might accesscomputers, will be placed in the custody of Gateways Hospital'srehabilitation program, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer saidMonday.   The judge said she will decide today whether Mitnick should alsobe sentenced to prison. He was scheduled to be sentenced thisafternoon.   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in March to computer fraud andpossessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes.   He previously was convicted of using unauthorized MCI longdistance codes to tap into computers at Leeds University in Englandand the University of Southern California, and of causing million ofdollars in damage to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.   Both Harriet Rossetto, the rehabilitation program's director, andAssistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said Mitnick's case wasthe first they had heard of in which a person charged with computerhacking had been treated as an addict.   Ms. Rossetto testified that Mitnick has an ``impulse disorder,''and would benefit from treatment. She said his illegal computeractivity gives him a sense of self-esteem he is otherwise lacking.   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was nogreed involved. There was no sabotage involved.'   ``It's something like climbing Mt. Everest,'' Asperger said. ``Hedid it because it's there.''</TEXT></DOC>
