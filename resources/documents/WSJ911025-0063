What's theappeal of a 328-foot behemoth who can't cross town withoutsmashing it up?   &quot;He destroys famous buildings,&quot; explains Hidekichi Yamane,who is Godzilla's publicity man at Toho Co., Japan's biggestdomestic movie maker, and since 1954 the studio that hasbrought the world tales of Godzilla, the King of Monsters.&quot;Human beings want to destroy tall buildings, but they can't.Godzilla can destroy them easily.&quot; The films have somethingto say about human nature, and about living vicariouslythrough lizards.</LP><TEXT>   In his soon-to-be released No. 18, &quot;Godzilla vs. KingGhidora,&quot; Godzilla is, as usual, a very &quot;now&quot; reptile. TheSultan of Saurians levels Tokyo's new 160 billion yen cityhall, a 48-story marble-and-steel complex that for manyTokyoites symbolizes the excesses of Japan in the late '80s.   But that's only after he kills the Americans.   Toho is confident the Lizard King will recoup its 1.5billion yen ($11.5 million) investment in &quot;King Ghidora&quot; whenGodzilla is once more unleashed on Japan in December.Godzilla has sold 73 million tickets here over the past 37years. It has played in more than 50 countries. The latestGodzilla vehicle will probably make it to the U.S. bymid-1992.   In Japan, he is known as &quot;Gojira&quot;, an amalgam of gorillaand &quot;kujira&quot;, the word for whale. And his secret of successis in staying au courant. When he was first starting out, hemerely terrorized townspeople. Godzilla today seems to have asocial conscience -- attacking environmental pollution,energy dependence and genetic engineering. In the process, hehas won millions of Japanese fans -- and a small fan club,called Godzilla Freaks Clan. Some like him for what he doesto cities with his blue death ray, and some, appreciatingsubtext, like Godzilla as a guardian of Japan's deeperfeelings.   &quot;I've gone to Godzilla movies every New Year season sinceI was born,&quot; says Haruhiko Okiyama, a 27-year-old freelanceinterior designer. &quot;He is the symbol of justice.&quot;   In &quot;King Ghidora,&quot; the monster for all seasons stays up todate by playing to Japan's continuing obsession with WorldWar II and its irritation with growing pressure from abroadto open its markets.   The plot: People from the 23rd century (mostly white maleswho occasionally speak in exaggerated American accents) go toa Pacific island in 1944, where Godzilla saves Japanesetroops under siege by Americans. Godzilla kills the U.S.soldiers but is hauled off to the Bering Sea by the timetravelers.   The Future Folk unleash on modern Japan King Ghidora, athree-headed dragon. Emi, Japanese heroine of the future,defects from the ranks of the Caucasians and discloses theirfiendish mission: to force Japan to buy foreign computers,and deny Nippon its economic destiny.   There's a big fight. (Not to give away too much, butGodzilla is very much alive at the end of the picture.Somebody else isn't. Tokyo's governor needs new offices.)   According to Kazuki Omori, the film's writer-director, thedestruction of city hall expresses Japanese ambivalence aboutprosperity. &quot;I feel relieved when he destroys buildings. It'sas if Godzilla is destroying the city full of gaudiness,&quot;says Mr. Omori, who has directed the three most recentGodzillas.   Moviegoer Mr. Okiyama, who says he will be happy to spend1700 yen ($13) on a ticket to see Godzilla fight city hall,takes a more extreme personal view: &quot;I can't stand it thathe's smaller than the Tokyo metropolitan government. I wanthim to destroy it all.&quot;   To inspire such partisanship, such fanatical devotion,Godzilla must be played with strength but sensitivity. That'swhere Kenpachiro Satsuma comes in. He has known Godzilla fromthe inside since 1985.   The 159-pound actor in a 176-pound lizard suit is a studyin dedication. &quot;I've never talked with other actors whoplayed Godzilla, you have to learn it physically,&quot; says Mr.Satsuma, who had portrayed the Smog Monster earlier in hiscareer. &quot;Playing Godzilla is completely different fromplaying a normal monster. You have to figure out how to beviolent and gentle.&quot;   Originally a fictional byproduct of U.S. hydrogen bombtests, the first Godzilla (the original Japan basher)destroyed the old Toho Studios headquarters on his 1954maiden rampage. The movie sold 9.6 million tickets at home.For the film's U.S. release, Toho spliced in 20 minutes, ofRaymond Burr mostly. It's a camp classic.   But &quot;there is revenge at the bottom of the movie,&quot; saysYukio Akatsuka, a wellknown social commentator. &quot;Monstersborn from a threat in real society have become more popular.&quot;   By 1963, Japan had largely recovered from the warmaterially, it was booming economically, and it had nuclearpower plants of its own. Accordingly, Godzilla, ever a socialchameleon, turned soft on atomic energy and defended Japanagainst various scary beasts.   Japan's new and hard-won prosperity made audiences want tohave fun at the movies, Mr. Yamane says, &quot;so Godzilla startedfighting other monsters.&quot; In his heyday, he fought one ayear.   And he got to be adorable. &quot;Frightening creatures becomecute after seeing them often,&quot; says Mr. Akatsuka.   Today, the Reigning Reptile brings Toho more than 5billion yen a year in trinket sales. Products range from winedecanters to a battery-powered Godzilla toilet-paperdispenser that roars when it rolls.   By the mid-70s, with monster possibilities pretty muchplayed out, Toho worried that Godzilla's tale was dragon ontoo long and tried to retire the Hoary Gila. But populardemand brought him back. Godzilla was a family favorite. AsMr. Yamane, Godzilla's PR man, puts it: Godzilla &quot;makes forgood communication between fathers and sons.&quot;   His comeback movie &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot; reunited Himself withhis old nemesis Mr. Burr, who plays a United Nationsofficial.   The comeback flick played in 1,500 U.S. theaters,according to Mr. Yamane. &quot;That's a big booking for a Japanesemovie.&quot; The acclaimed films of Akira Kurosawa, on the otherhand, more commonly &quot;play in five or six theaters,&quot; he notes.A punk Godzilla doll in a blond Mohawk, beams down from anearby file cabinet in Mr. Yamane's office.   Given its anti-American overtones, the 1991 Godzilla maynot be boffo at the Peoria box office. But Toho still expectsto find a U.S. distributor, as it has with all the otherGodzilla movies.   Diehard fan Mr. Okiyama from his standpoint doesn'tforesee any problem, either. &quot;My American friends sayGodzilla is the only Japanese star that would make it inHollywood. I agree. When Americans talk about him, their eyesbecome like children's.&quot;   If the Saber-Toothed Salamander keeps filling theaters,Toho plans to make its new-look Godzilla movies every two orthree years. As 23rd century Emi says, &quot;of course I'll comeback. I really like this era.&quot;   But Mr. Satsuma, the man in the belly of the beast, willneed better ventilation in his lizard costume if he is toappear in a fourth Godzilla movie. The suit he wears has justa dozen tiny air holes around the neckline. Sometimes it getshard to breathe when he takes out a skyscraper.</TEXT></DOC>
