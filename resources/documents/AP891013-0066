ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's handling of flag legislationhe didn't want but didn't dare veto demonstrates anew hisunderstanding of the red, white and blue politics he used soeffectively against Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidentialcampaign.   Veto a bill that makes it a crime to desecrate the flag? Bushwas not about to fall into the legalistic trap that ensnaredDukakis when he vetoed legislation to require recitation of thePledge of Allegiance to the flag.   Then was Bush ready to sign the flag bill into law? Not exactly.   This president, who is raising the art of compromise to newlevels, took a different tack. He suggested he didn't dislike thelegislation enough to veto it; he didn't like it enough to sign it.   ``I will allow the bill to become law without my signature,''said Bush, who vowed to continue pressing for a constitutionalamendment.   It was a graphic reminder of Bush's 1988 campaign stand that hewould have found a way to require teachers to lead pupils in thePledge of Allegiance.   For Dukakis, there was no compromise when confronted withlegislation he believed violated the Constitution. He saw hischoice as sign or veto; his duty as veto.   Bush rarely sees things in such stark terms, even an issue thathe pursues with as much fervor as protecting the flag.   The bill sent to Bush would mandate up to a year in jail and a$1,000 fine for anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces,physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, ortramples upon any flag of the United States.''   Many critics believe the bill will not pass review by theSupreme Court. Bush never has publicly addressed the issue of itsconstitutionality.   It moved through Congress swiftly, completing its legislativejourney with a 317-to-34 vote Thursday in the House.   After the Supreme Court ruled last June that flag-burning was aconstitutionally protected form of free speech, Bush was among thefirst to call for amending the Constitution to permit Congress andthe states to make such behavior illegal.   He stood before the Iwo Jima memorial, a statue depictingMarines raising the flag on that bloody World War II battleground,to declare his support for an amendment and his belief it was anissue that ``transcends politics and patriotism.''   But the politics of the moment were unmistakable.   While congressional Democrats balked at amending theConstitution, they had learned the lessons of the 1988 presidentialcampaign.   ``Before we amend the Constitution we should approach thequestion with a statutory change,'' said House Speaker ThomasFoley, D-Wash. The Democrats rushed to draft legislation to protectthe flag without changing the Constitution.   Bush termed their efforts ``inadequate'' but he steered clear ofmaking the debate a partisan fight.   ``I don't have disrespect for those who want to find a differentanswer,'' was his response when asked to comment on the legislativeeffort.   While Foley echoed the president's statements about keeping thedebate above politics, the Democrats had to get some satisfactionout of putting Bush in the position of opposing their flagprotection bill.   But they had little hope Bush would react the way Dukakis did tothe Pledge of Allegiance bill passed by the Massachusettslegislature during his first term as governor.   Dukakis vetoed that bill because he believed it wasunconstitutional to require public school teachers to lead pupilsin daily recitation of the Pledge and he never seemed to comprehendwhy people didn't agree with his view of his clear duty in thatcase.   In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination,Bush put the issue this way:   ``Should public school teachers be required to lead our childrenin the Pledge of Allegiance? My opponent says no _ but I say yes.''   He closed that speech by asking ``everyone in this great hall tostand and join me'' as he recited the Pledge of Allegiance.</TEXT></DOC>
