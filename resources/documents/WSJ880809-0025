Files Claim Against Holder Alleging False Filings </HL><SO> </SO><CO> WNR </CO><DATELINE> NASHVILLE, Tenn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Winners Corp. filed a claim in federal court seeking $4.4 million in damages from Francis J. Spillman, a Dallas investor who launched an abortive bid early this year to take over the company.    In the claim, the Brentwood, Tenn., restaurant chain alleged that Mr. Spillman made false statements in a series of filings between January and July with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Among other things, Winners accuses Mr. Spillman of at one point falsely stating the number of Winners' shares he held.    Neither Mr. Spillman nor his attorneys could be reached for comment.    Formerly president of Pizza Inn Inc., Mr. Spillman proposed in a January filing with the SEC a buy-out of Winners by an investor group. Mr. Spillman and other members of the group held 9.7% of Winners' shares outstanding at the time but never made an offer for the rest of the shares. The group has since reduced its holdings in Winners and as of July 15 held only 4.24% of the shares outstanding.    Winners opposed the buy-out proposal and in April Mr. Spillman filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop Winners' annual shareholders meeting. But a federal judge denied his request.    Now, Winners is filing a counterclaim against Mr. Spillman and Larry G. Hood, a Dallas businessman and member of the investor group. Winners is seeking $4 million in punitive damages and $400,000 in compensatory damages.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Winners closed at $1.625, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
