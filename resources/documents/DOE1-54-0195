Aworldwide survey of nuclear power plants reveals that the average performanceof plants shows a trend towards improvement, as indicated by higher loadfactors and energy availability factors in 1985 compared with 1979. Resultsof an outage analysis for water cooled reactors are also presented -the number of outages due to the conventional systems was greater thanthat attributed to nuclear systems.
