A Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint filedMonday accused Stephen Wang Jr., a junior analyst in a trainingprogram at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., of giving secrets about impendingcorporate takeovers to Fred C. Lee, a Morgan Stanley client withhomes in Hong Kong and McLean, Va., a swank Washington suburb.   ``From at least July 1987 through at least April 1988, Leeplaced long-distance telephone calls from McLean, Va., Hong Kongand elsewhere to Wang at his home and office in New York,'' readthe SEC complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. ``During thesetelephone calls, Wang improperly disclosed to Lee the material,non-public information.''   Lee paid Wang at least $200,000 for the information, accordingto the complaint.   Thomas C. Newkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel, said aprobe into the activities of Wang and Lee was continuing and he didnot rule out the possibility that others may have been involved.   SEC sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, alsosaid they expected federal prosecutors to seek criminal indictmentsagainst Wang and Lee, the same pattern that emerged in the Boeskycase.   The SEC said Lee made $19 million by trading on the tips andshared at least $200,000 of the money with Wang. It demanded thepair return the money plus pay triple that amount in penalties, fora total of $76 million.   The amount is second only to the record $100 million in profitand fines paid in November 1986 by Boesky. The former, well-knownspeculator was at the center of a massive scandal in which WallStreeters illegally used confidential corporate information toprofit in stock transactions.   Boesky, who implicated a number of other Wall Streetprofessionals, was banished from the securities business for lifeand is serving a three-year federal prison term.   Morgan Stanley, which was an adviser in the proposed takeoverslisted in the complaint, moved quickly to distance itself from anysuggestion of wrongdoing. The firm said it suspended Wang lastFriday after the SEC subpoeanaed him.   The firm also said it had been cooperating with the SEC for sometime in its probe and was considering separate but unspecifiedlegal action against Wang and Lee.   The New York Times in today's editions quoted unidentifiedsources as saying that Morgan Stanley's compliance department hadpicked up suspicious trading in Lee's account as early as last year.   Newkirk said the SEC began investigating the matter in April butthe probe did not break until Friday, when Lee admitted details ofhis arrangement with Wang to commission officials interviewing Leein Hong Kong.   Morgan Stanley officials said Wang lived in New York but hiswhereabouts were unclear. Wang's lawyer, former SEC regionalcommissioner Ira L. Sorkin, declined to comment on the complaint orhis client.   Wang, 24, was only a few days away from the July 1 expiration ofhis two-year training period at Morgan Stanley, which like otherbig brokerages utilizes an extensive recruiting system. He hadspent the second year of the program in the firm's mergers andacquisitions unit.   Trainees are expected to leave at the end of the program. Mostusually go to graduate business school and some are invited toreturn.   An employee of Wang's rank generally made a salary and bonusthat totaled around $35,000 a year, sources at the firm said.   Lee, 38, was described by Morgan Stanley and SEC sources as awealthy member of a Taiwanese family who had a number of tradingand bank accounts, interests in real estate, import-exportoperations and public utilities.   SEC investigators also asked that Lee's bank accounts be frozen,alleging in the complaint that Lee had attempted to move money outof the United States.   Gary Lynch, the SEC enforcement chief, said investigators allegethe trading on inside information involved stock in about 25different companies, including E.F. Hutton Group Inc. Stop andamp; ShopCos., Utah Power andamp; Light Co. and Impact Systems.   The complaint said, for example, Lee made $3 million in profitby trading the stock of Stop and Shop; $1.2 million in profits on thestock of E.F. Hutton; and $840,000 in profits on Utah Power.</TEXT></DOC>
