The Japanese trade minister declared, however, that hisgovernment would refuse to take part in such talks under duress.   The administration singled out the three nations Thursday nightfor priority action under a 1988 trade law that calls for penaltiesagainst countries that are deemed to be especially protectionist.   ``Our goal is to open markets and to eliminate trade barriers.We oppose protectionism in any and all forms. Therefore, I urge thegovernments of Japan, India, and Brazil to work constructively withus to resolve these issues expeditiously,'' the president said in astatement announcing the negotiation date as he left on a trip toEurope.   The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act requires the administration to issuewhat amounts to a hit list that names the countries whose tradebarriers are most harmful to American producers. The governmentthen has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers.   Failure of the talks could lead to tariffs of up to 100 percenton selected exports from the offending countries.   Announcing the action, U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hillstold reporters, ``This exercise is not intended to be offensive. Ihope there is no backlash.''   However, Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga issued a statementcalling the decision to include his country ``extremelyregrettable.''   In Tokyo, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, minister of international trade andindustry, said in a statement: ``The government of Japan has nointention of entering into negotiations with the United Statesunder the conditions imposed (in the law).''   Taizo Watanabe, spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, wasless emphatic, saying that while Japan will not negotiate underterms of the law, it may propose ``quiet talks and jointcooperation'' that may ``coincide with'' the negotiationsWashington wants.   India joined Japan in criticizing the U.S. action. CommerceMinister Dinesh Singh said it was ``totally unjustified, irrationaland unfair.''   Hills also announced the United States would be watching closely25 countries suspected of failing to protect U.S. copyrights andpatents and said the Bush administration would reveal the status ofthe eight most flagrant ones in November.   The Japanese lobbied in recent weeks to stay off the list of toptrade violators. They were less successful, however, than theKoreans, who made a number of trade concessions in recent days anddid manage to avoid inclusion.   ``In light of the good faith efforts that have been made, thegovernment of Japan and the Japanese people are greatlydisappointed by this one-sided decision,'' Matsunaga said. ``Theremay well be some domestic backlash in Japan which will make theresolution of the various problemseven more difficult.''   Japan was cited for its refusal to buy U.S. supercomputers andsatellites as well as its barriers to purchase of U.S. woodproducts. The United States ran a trade deficit of $52 billion lastyear with Japan, or 44 percent of the $119.8 billion U.S. tradeimbalance.   India was cited for barriers that bar foreign investment and theclosing of its insurance market to foreign companies.   The administration cited Brazil for quotas on imports andlicensing restrictions.   Hills said the administration plans ``to immediately commencenegotiations on all of this that we have identified'' but addedthat there was no certainty that they could succeed.   ``I have no assurance,'' she said. ``I have only my own goodwill and I hope we can approach these negotiations with aconstructive dialogue.''   Besides citing Japan, Brazil and India for flagrant tradebarriers, the administration placed eight countries on a ``prioritywatch list'' of nations that have failed to protect U.S. copyrightsand patents. It declined, however, to target any countries forpriority action on that issue.   It did establish a lesser ``watch list'' of 17 other countriesthat have not established safeguards against infringement on U.S.copyrights and patents.   The president also has directed Cabinet officials to openseparate negotiations with the Japanese on eliminating ``structuralimpediments'' to sales of U.S. goods within their economy. Theimpediments range from pricing mechanisms to bid rigging.   In his statement today, Bush said U.S. officials looked at ``alarge number of practices'' that ultimately were not listed _including Japanese rice quotas and the subsidies given by theEuropean Community to the manufacturers of Airbus airliners. Hesaid it was felt they could be better addressed through existinginternational trade forums.   On Capitol Hill, Senate sponsors of the trade law reactedfavorably to the administration's action.   ``I expect we'll hear howls of outrage from both sides on this,claims the action was either rash or timid,'' Senate FinanceCommittee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said in a statement.   Bentsen called the move ``only a first step but an important onein establishing an effective trade policy. ... We've let the worldknow where our priorities lie when it comes to opening markets.''   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., called the action ``a verypositive first step,'' and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said ``I thinkthe administration deserves a passing grade. They are stepping upto the problem.''   Elsewhere in Congress, however, voices of dissent suggested thatthe administration had not gone far enough.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he was ``disappointed'' thatHills ``left off so many other unfair Japanese trade practices fromthe list, including auto parts and construction services.''   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said the decision ``is more acompromise among factions within the administration than a clearmessage to our trading partners and a clear policy for America.''   The president's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, andbudget director Richard Darman had argued strenuously thattargeting Japan would do more harm than good, while Hills andCommerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called for a tough crackdown.   Danforth told reporters, however, he saw nothing unusual aboutdisagreement within an administration before such a decision.   Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., said the targeting of Japan showedthat the trade law ``is beginning to produce important results.''   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,called the plan ``a positive first step toward dismantling foreigntrade barriers.''   Countries named to the priority watch list for patents andcopyrights were Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico, China, Saudi Arabia,Taiwan and Thailand.   Additional countries named to what the administration describedas a less urgent watch list were Argentina, Canada, Chile,Columbia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia,Pakistan, the Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Venezuela andYugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
