The increase comes despite sluggish early October sales and layoffs at General Motors Corp.    GM, in a previously announced move, laid off 2,300 workers Monday when it cut one of two shifts at its Buick City plant in Flint, Mich. The laid-off workers had been producing the Buick LeSabre model, which has suffered slow sales in recent months.    But GM said it stepped up production at some of its other plants, including the Lansing, Mich., plant that produces the Pontiac Grand Am. Overall, GM planned to boost production this week by 4.5% to 77,573 cars from 74,216 built a year ago.    Ford Motor Co. said it had scheduled weekday overtime at all but one of its assembly plants. The company expected to build 39,916 cars this week, up 23% from 32,582 in the year-ago week.    Chrysler Corp. expected its production to decline 11% this week to 25,300 cars from 28,564 a year ago. Chrysler's Belvidere, Ill., assembly plant reopened this week after a one-week shutdown caused by a parts shortage.    In the year to date, the seven major domestic automakers have built 5,669,578 cars. They built 6,284,519 cars in the same period last year.    ---            This    Last    Yr.
