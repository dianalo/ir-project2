RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group supporting the separation of church andstate today lost a Supreme Court challenge to a cancellation stampthat commemorated a 1987 visit to the United States by Pope JohnPaul II.   The court, without comment, refused to revive a lawsuit by theTexas-based Society of Separationists against the Postal Service.   The group's leader, Ralph B. Shirley of Austin, Texas, said thestamp improperly used taxpayer money to promote religion.   At the request of a customer, post offices in the nine cities thepope visited in 1987 would use a special rubber stamp bearing theemblem of the Vatican in Rome to cancel postcards and first-classletters.   The cancellation stamps were used only during the pope's visit.   Shirley said, ``The purpose of the Postal Service incommemorating the visit of the pope is clearly religious. The pope'svisit is in no way a secular event.''   A federal judge threw out the suit, and the dimisssal was upheldlast July by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The appeals court said the case is moot _ no longer posing a livecontroversy _ since the stamps were discontinued. Generally, courtsdo not consider cases without live issues.   Since the case is moot, a court would take it up only if theSociety of Separationists can show that the Postal Service couldrepeat the action in a way that would evade review by the courts,the appeals court said.   It said the group has ``not established a demonstratedprobability or a reasonable expectation that the current pope or hissuccessor will visit the U.S. and that the Postal Service willcommemorate the event with special cancellations.''   Shirley said the appeals court ignored the reality of whathappened during previous papal visits to the United States.   Similar cancellation stamps were used to honor Pope John Paul IIin 1979, 1981 and twice in 1984, Shirley said.   The Postal Service limits the time that the stamps can bechallenged in court by waiting until he is about to arrive beforeannouncing the stamps, Shirley said.   ``This is a sly trick of the Postal Service to attempt to blockreview of its unlawful acts'' by the courts, added the group'sappeal acted on today.   The case is Shirely vs. Schraer, 88-712.</TEXT></DOC>
