George Miranda, a Teamsters spokesman, called Pan Am's move &quot;the last straw by desperate people who are running the (Pan Am) board.&quot; If contract talks end, he said, &quot;we intend to strike.&quot; Neither Pan Am nor the mediation board would comment.    The Teamsters represent 4,500 Pan Am ticket agents, reservation agents and clerical workers. They have been working under a contract that was negotiated in 1978, was scheduled to be renegotiated in 1981 and continues to be in effect. The federal mediation board has rejected several earlier requests by the union to declare the negotiations deadlocked.    If the board declares an impasse, and either party refuses to submit to arbitration, the union would be free to strike Pan Am after a 30-day cooling-off period.    In February 1985, Pan Am's Transport Workers Union, representing about 5,700 mechanics, baggage handlers and food service workers, went on strike for a month. Pilots, flight engineers and flight attendants also stayed off the job for part of the strike, which largely caused Pan Am's $138.7 million loss in the first quarter of 1985.    Some securities analysts expect Pan Am to report a loss of as much as $90 million this year. Meanwhile, the company is trying to negotiate cost savings with its four non-Teamsters unions that would permit the merger of the airline with Dallas-based Braniff Inc.    Separately, former Secretary of Transportation William Coleman, the Pan Am director who is heading the company's effort to get wage concessions from its unions, met yesterday with leaders of the Transport Workers Union. Last week, he met with representatives of Pan Am's pilots and flight engineers. </TEXT></DOC>
