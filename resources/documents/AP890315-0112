For the first time in 41 years, the anniversary of themonths-long revolution was a legal public holiday, a symbol ofHungary's increasingly independent course and democratic reforms.   Many used the day off to go shopping in neighboring Austria forthe electronic gadgets and other goods that are in short supply inHungary.   But thousands more massed at Communist Party gatherings andindependent rallies. Calls for a neutral, independent Hungary andcriticism of the Soviet Union punctuated today's rallies.   About 50,000 people at a rally in Budapest applauded a call fromindependent groups for more rights and freedom.   ``Not only should March 15 be a day of freedom, but the 16th,17th 18th and all the other days of the year,'' declared DenesCsengey, a leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, one of thelargest of Hungary's new independent groups.   Shouts of ``We demand! We demand!'' rang out as speakers read aproposal for free elections, disbanding of paramilitary policeforces and the creation of a national holiday on Oct. 23 _ the startof the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt.   Today's ceremonies began with an official wreathlaying and aparty rally outside the National Museum.   For the first time, Communist Party speakers such as leadingCommunist reformer Reszoe Nyers shared the rostrum with leaders fromthe Social Democrats and the Smallholders' Party, two parties formedrecently.   Nyers won applause from the crowd of 60,000 when he said thatHungarian policy from 1948 to 1956 was largely steered by theKremlin.   He also charged that under the leadership of Soviet PresidentLeonid Brezhnev, an ``anti-reform spirit'' blew from Moscow acrosseastern Europe and choked Hungarian reforms.   After the official rally, about 40,000 people converged on amonument to Sandor Petoefi, the firebrand poet of the short-lived1848 revolt, to hear speakers from independent groups.   Although reforms have legalized the new independent groups, andthe Communist Party has agreed in principle to a multiparty system,Hungarian activists are pressing for more freedom and greaterindependence within the Soviet bloc.   During today's rally, a banner reading ``Independent Hungary,''fluttered on a nearby bridge. Another huge banner with the words,``56, 68, 81'' and the national flags of Hungary, Czechoslovakia andPoland recalled the violent suppression of reforms in thosecountries in those years.   The March 15 anniversary has been an occasion for anti-Communistrallies by dissidents and unofficial groups since the early 1970s.   In 1986, riot police brutally dispersed crowds who took part inthat year's rally, and last year eight leading dissidents weredetained on the anniversary and police broke up an evening march.   This year, the official dailies published the schedule of theindependent groups. Police helicopters occasionally buzzed overdemonstrators, but there was no police interference.</TEXT></DOC>
