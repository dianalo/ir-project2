Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, told the National Association ofMortgage Brokers that his first priority as chairman would be thesavings and loan crisis.   Gonzalez is the senior member of the committee and has thebacking of House leaders to take over from the current chairman,Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., who lost his bid for a 15thHouse term.   He told the mortgage brokers that he has asked to meet withTreasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to present the plan, and wouldalso seek a meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.   Under the proposal, the Treasury would open a $50 billion line ofcredit to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Money fromthe sale of loans and repossessed property from the failed Sandamp;Lscould then be funneled back to the Treasury.   Gonzalez said his recommendation could be accomplished withlittle or no legislation. He acknowledged that the administrationhas resisted any use of taxpayer funds in the crisis, but, he saidit might be more receptive now, after the presidential election.   ``Nobody wanted much to rock the boat before the election,'' hesaid.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures commercialbanks but has been tracking Sandamp;L losses, estimates it will cost $65billion to clean up the Sandamp;L mess. The most recent figures, for thesecond quarter of this year, show that the problem is growing by $15billion a year, FDIC spokesman Alan J. Whitney said Monday.   ``The FSLIC, it's broke. ... There's no other way to put it,''Gonzalez said. ``... Nobody wants a taxpayer bailout ... but thereare limits to what the industry can do and they've reached thoselimits.''   Later, speaking with reporters, he said, ``If it ever gets aroundthat there's nothing insuring those accounts and deposits, you couldhave chaos.''   After insolvent Sandamp;Ls are closed, Gonzalez said he would preservethe conventional Sandamp;L system, aided by a National Housing Trust tostabilize mortgage interest rates.   ``We've got to save some semblance of the system,'' he said.   He criticized the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's policy ofkeeping failed Sandamp;Ls open after merger with another institition and athin infusion of capital from private investors.   ``They stitch these dead corpses together. All that does is makea bigger stinking corpse,'' Gonzalez said.</TEXT></DOC>
