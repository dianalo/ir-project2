De Klerk met with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev.Allan Boesak and the Rev. Frank Chikane. The talks were the firstde Klerk has held with militant black leaders since he took powerin August.   De Klerk's announced Tuesday that the government would freeeight longtime prisoners, including seven leaders of the outlawedAfrican National Congress. A prison official said the release wouldbe within two weeks.   Anti-apartheid activists welcomed the announcement but calledthe move insufficent unless the government also frees AfricanNational Congress leader Nelson Mandela, legalizes bannedorganizations, and lifts restrictions on many black leaders not inprison.   ``What is the use of releasing them when we still have a stateof emergency and when our organizations are still banned?'' theRev. Allan Boesak asked 4,000 people at a rally at the Universityof the Western Cape Tuesday night.   ``Eight is not enough, with detainees and political prisoners,including Nelson Mandela, still being held hostage,'' said Boesak,president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.   The government has indicated Mandela may be released within thenext few months.   Also today, police used tear gas and batons to stop black youthsfrom entering a sports stadium in the mixed-race township ofAthlone, near Cape Town, where about 3,000 had gathered tocelebrate Mpetha's expected release.   Police forbade the crowd from marching out of the stadium, andthe youths sang freedom songs before dispersing quietly when theywere told Mpetha had not yet been freed.   State radio acknowledged in an editorial today that theprisoners have a constituency among South Africa's black majorityand need to be part of negotiations.   ``Where Walter Sisulu ... and others are recognized by somecommunities in South Africa as their authentic leaders _ and ifthey, too, subscribe to democratic and peaceful objectives _ thereis a need for them to be placed in a position where they can make acontribution to the debate on just how a future South Africa shouldlook,'' Radio South Africa said.   Sisulu is the country's most respected black leader afterMandela.   Mandela, told of the releases in advance, was with a group ofanti-apartheid leaders at his home on the Victor Verster prisonfarm north of Cape Town when state television made the announcement.   ``Mr. Mandela said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonightafter all his efforts to secure their release,'' said MurphyMorobe, a spokesman for the banned United Democratic Frontanti-apartheid alliance.   He quoted the 71-year-old Mandela as saying to South Africans:``The people are going to be greatly endowed by the leadership whoare coming out of jail.''   ``This unexpected turn of events will take the townships bystorm and thousands will welcome them home,'' the Sowetan, thenation's largest black daily newspaper, said today.   In Blackpool, England, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomedthe announcement of the releases, calling it ``a major step in theright direction.''   De Klerk said the men would be freed ``as soon as the necessaryformalities'' are handled. A prison official said privately theprocess can take from an hour to two weeks.   De Klerk took office in August and, unlike his predecessors,appears to be in earnest when he says he wants to allow eventualpower-sharing with the black majority.   Sisulu ran daily operations of the ANC as its secretary-generalin 1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign. He wassentenced to life in June 1964, along with Mandela and otherleaders of the ANC's internal military wing, for sabotage andplotting the overthrow of the goverment.   Mandela's other co-defendants to be freed are Ahmed Kathrada,60; Andrew Mlangeni, 63; Elias Motsoaledi, 65; and Raymond Mhlaba,69.   Wilton Mkwayi, 66, who took command of the ANC military wing,Spear of the Nation, after Mandela's co-defendants were arrested inJuly 1963, is to be released from a life term he received after aseparate trial in 1964.   De Klerk's announcement also named Oscar Mpetha, an 80-year-old,partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of hisfive-year prison term in the hospital and was due for release nextyear.   Mpetha, the country's oldest political prisoner, was the ANCleader in Cape province and, during the appeal of his terrorismsentence in 1983, was elected a co-president of the UnitedDemocratic Front.   The eighth man, Jafta Masemula, was a member of the outlawed PanAfricanist Congress guerrilla organization sentenced to life in1963 for sabotage.</TEXT></DOC>
