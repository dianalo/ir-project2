Police reportedwidespread violence.   Ten people were killed during the strike, South Africa's longestand biggest general strike.   Police said they dispersed unruly crowds with shotguns and teargas.   Black labor unions and anti-apartheid groups staged the boycottto protest a 2-year-old state of emergency, more recentrestrictions on their activities and proposed legislation torestrict the rights of unions to strike.   The death toll from violence reported by police since the strikebegan Monday rose to 10 with the shotgun death of a toddler and themachete-killing of a young man.   Overnight, a train engine and freight car were derailed nearJohannesburg; buses, private trucks, police vehicles, and homeswere firebombed and stoned in several townships in Natal andTransvaal province, police said.   They said 15 people were injured and 25 arrested.   The government has said the protest is illegal, and employerssaid Tuesday that workers were returning to their jobs in manyareas.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation's largestblack union group, said at least 2.5 million people had honored theboycott.   Independent analysts said those figures were probably high. Butbased on the low numbers of passengers riding buses and trains fromthe black townships to cities such as Johannesburg, Durban and PortElizabeth, the absentee rate among black workers nationwide easilycould exceed 1.5 million, they said.   Including the near-total boycott by urban black students, thefigure for each day would have surpassed 2 million, the estimatednumber of people who stayed home on June 16, 1986, during a protestagainst the beginning of the national state of emergency.   That strike was the longest staged over many different economicsectors.   The congress said it would consider meeting with thegovernment's manpower chief to discuss the labor bill that sparkedthe strike.   Police said a 22-year-old man was hacked to death with a machetein Hammarsdale, in Natal, and a 2-year-old child was found deadwith a shotgun wound to the chest in Ashdown, also in Natal.   They said a group of blacks killed the man after setting homeson fire, but they gave no details on the death of the child.   Police reported using shotgun fire, tear gas and rubber bulletsto disperse crowds in several cases of violence in Natal, wheregroups who oppose the strike have clashed with militant protestsupporters.   The black trade union group called on employers to participatein an independent inquiry into the effects of the labor bill, whichall black unions have opposed. It said it would also considermeeting with Manpower Minister Pieter du Plessis to discuss thelegislation, which is about to be passed in the white-dominatedParliament.   Congress leader Jay Naidoo said the strike reflected ``thewide-scale resentment and anger'' about orders issued in Februarythat barred his organization and other anti-apartheid groups frompolitical activity.   President P.W. Botha's government imposed the emergency June 12,1986, to combat a black uprising against apartheid, under whichSouth Africa's 5 million whites control the country and deny its 26million blacks a voice in national affairs.   Du Plessis has warned workers that they might be dismissed fromtheir jobs for participating in the strike.   Police have warned news media about reporting on the extent ofthe strike, and the government-run broadcasting services havecontinually given upbeat reports about percentages of workersreturning to their jobs since Monday.   Figures from government and private transport companies andemployers indicated that the black workforce attendance in most ofthe Johannesburg-Pretoria area was half of normal. In Durban, thenation's third largest city, about 90 percent of the workers werestaying home.   The private PUTCO bus company said ridership from blacktownships east of Johannesburg was 98 percent below normal.Ridership from Soweto however was 40 percent below average,representing a steady increase each day from the country's largestblack township.   Despite reports of the strike's success, the mining industry,which produces 80 percent of South Africa's export earnings, hasbeen only slightly affected by the protest.</TEXT></DOC>
