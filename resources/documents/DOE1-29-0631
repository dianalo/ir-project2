This information is basedon experience gathered in the course of about six years. So far a totalof more than 3,000 analog inputs and about 1,400 analog outputs havebeen performed by means of automation systems supplied by three differentsystem manufacturers. The intention has been to make use of the opportunitiesoffered by these systems in as efficient a way as possible to make boththe control and the operation of the processes more effective. The smoothcooperation between the company's internal engineering consultants andthe operating organizations has offered excellent opportunities for thiswork in the engineering and implementation phases of the projects. Theproject for modernization of the whole refinery automation may serveas an example. The backgrounds and objectives of the project, as wellas the results achieved with the microprocessor-based automation systemand aspects related to the operating personnel, are presented in thispaper. Likewise, engineering systems, the technical solutions used, andthe distribution of work between the process computers and the distributeddigital automation systems are shown.</TEXT></DOC>
