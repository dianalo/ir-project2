 The ability to capture,store distribute and present images of original documentation offers a numberof promises:andM;* Original paper, once captured, may be moved out of expensive real estatefor destruction or storage elsewhere to drastically reduce or eliminatestorage costs.andM;* Documentation will be instantly available to all workstations on thenetworks, improving service and reducing the cost of retrieval.andM;* Access to documents may be controlled to deny access to unauthorizedpersonnel.andM;* Operations may be decentralized to provide improved regional service withaccess to global information previously reserved solely to the head officetower.andM;* Updated documents may be made instantly available to all network userswithout the time and cost involved in paper revision and distribution.andM;To introduce the technology, workstations and printers can be compared withfamiliar objects such as television receivers and character cell terminals.andO;In the north american television system the receiver presents, at best, 500picture elements (pixels) across the screen -- no matter its size.andP;  This isgood enough for non-critical viewing, but it is hopelessly inadequate topresent a line of relatively crude - dot matrix characters.andM;A reasonably good character cell display unit must present at least 700pixels to avoid looking distinctly fuzzy.andP;  If we attempt to present an imageof a typed document, for example, we find that we need a resolution of atleast 100 dots per inch (dpi).andP;  On a 14-inch screen, this corresponds toroughly 1,100 pixels -- double the resolution of a 'good' television screen.andM;Even a resolution of 100 dpi is far from adequate to produce acceptableprinted copy.andP;  The best 24-pin impact printers can achieve about 180 dpi butthe 300 dpi laser printer has become the de facto standard for good qualitycommercial use.andP;  Professional printers would scorn such poor stuff in favorof 1,200 dpi machines but these are beyond the needs of mere commerce and areexpensive.andM;If a system is to store an image of a letter-sized page at a resolution of300 dpi then the system must store 8,415,000 pixels or bits of information.andO;This equates to about one MB of memory.andP;  Since a laser printer must acquirethe entire image before it can print it, such printers need at least one MBof internal memory to reproduce simple monochrome images.andM;If each pixel is to represent various shades of grey or color, then thestorage requirements increase accordingly.andP;  However, grey-scale imagereproduction presents a number of problems briefly noted later.andM;A densley typed standardsized letter, with a bit of word processing overhead,could be stored in about four KB of memory.andP;  To store this same document inraw, bit-mapped, image format would increase the storage requirement by some2,000 times.andP;  However, data compression techniques can reduce the requirementdown to some 40 KB.andP;  That's still an order of magnitude greater than simpletext characters but it's at least manageable and well within the capacity ofcurrently available disk storage devices.andM;However, this level of resolution and the corresponding data required tosupport it is quite beyond the capabilities of simple full duplex,host-to-terminal, asynchronous techniques.andP;  The load on the host machinewould be unbearable and the bandwidth of typical asynchronous channels wouldbe hopelessly inadequate.andP;  Add windowing techniques to the scene and the'workstation' with its own dedicate processor becomes mandatory.andM;Fortunately, there are some snazzy, high-speed processor chips which canprovide the power required to handle graphics and raster displays at aneconomic price.andP;  But the sheer volume of data exchanged in aworkstation/server network can be limited by readily available communicationslinks.andM;Only a few short years ago disk storage was an expensive chunk of hardwarethat resembled a laundry machine, but cost a lot more.andP;  Today, evenbattery-powered laptops can boast of 80 MB disks and five-inch devicestypically offer capacity in excess of 600 MB.andP;  Furthermore, these things arecheap.andM;The evolution of the audio compact disk into optical storage devices hasreached the point where 1.2 GB WORM (write once/read many) devices arecommon.andP;  Twenty-five of these cartridge disks in a 'juke box' can provide upto 30 GB of on-line storage -- enough to handle, 750,000 average documentswith access times measured in seconds rather than days, for example.andM;We have seen how images typically require 10 times the storage that wouldotherwise be required to store the same document in ASCII characters.andO;Clearly, transmission paths must be improved by the same order of magnitudeif response times are to be maintained.andM;Local-area networks (LANs) do not present much of a problem.andP;  Ethernet can beused with small systems and fibre optic LANs operating at 100 Mbps provide ameans of handling larger systems.andP;  The history of telecommunicationstechnology reflects a constant search for wide-band channels and techniquesto multiplex users to get the best possible use out of the availablebandwidth.andM;With the introduction of FibreWorld in October, 1989, by Northern Telecom andBell North Research, and search for bandwidth is over.andP;  For the first time inits history, the telecommunications industry is literally free of bandwidthconstraints and is building a single, homogenous facility to carry anythingfrom plain ordinary telephone service (POTS) to full-motion, high-definitionvideo.andP;  Furthermore, users will dial up bandwidth on demand.andM;The synchronous optical network (SONET) is a major technological breakthroughwhich provides the low-cost, highspeed service required for the free exchangeof electronic images.andM;Not to be outdone, software technology has also evolved: object-orientedtechniques are singularly appropriate to frame concepts (developed fordesktop publishing packagese and multimedia databases have been designed tocope with the special needs of imaging.andM;Evolving technologies in a number of different disciplines have converged tomake electronic document imaging technically feasible and economicallyviable.andP;  Office automation is no longer constrained to the exchange of keyeddocuments but may include facsimiles of originals be they handwritten memos,titles deeds or circuit diagrams.andM;The most obvious users are large organizations which must handle vastquantities of original documentation and are required to make thatdocumentation available on short notice over a wide geographic area.andO;Governments and insurance operations may achieve immediate and quitespectacular results from imaging techniques applied to their vast collectionsof original documents.andM;The automobile industry must produce manuals and illustrated parts lists tosupport its products in the field.andP;  Producing the supporting documentation inthe first instance is a non-trivial task to say the least.andP;  Updating it is anightmare at source and destination.andP;  There is no doubt that imagingtechniques could be employed to provide service centres with on-line, updatedproduct information.andM;Communications costs are likely to be prohibitive: nevertheless, thepotential of imaging techniques in this and like applications remainsimpressive.andM;Since history has a habit of repeating itself, it is probably a good idea torecall the evolution of digital computers as we now know them.andP;  These thingsstarted off a expensive monsters and have evolved through minicomputers todesktop machines.andP;  Each step in the evolution provided more power for lesscost and broadened the base of users.andM;There is energy reason to expect imaging technology will follow the sameevolutionary path.andP;  With any luck at all, the evolutionary process will beevery bit as exciting.andM;Imaging a $4.3-billionandM;(U.S.) industry: AIIMandM;SILVER SPRING, Md.andP;  -- Sales of electronic imaging systems and equipmentcatapulted over the billion-dollar mark last year, according a recent studyfrom the Association for Information Image Management (AIIM).andM;Called Information and Image Management: The State of the Industry, 1990, thestudy shows that AIIM trade member companies reported revenues of $1.2billion (U.S.) in the electronic imaging sector and $2.3 billion (U.S.) inmicrographics.andP;  With another $634 million (U.S.) in image management servicesand $112 million (U.S.) in miscellaneous sales, AIIM trade members brought intotal imaging revenues of $4.3 billion (U.S.) in 1989.andP;  The study expands onthe 1989 report.andP;  Both studies were conducted by the management consultingfirm Temple, Barker and Sloane Inc.andM;Two major empirical components formed the basis of research: a survey ofrevenues of 494 AIIM trade member companies, which represent the bulk of theimaging industry and a survey of 726 end-user organizations.andP;  The 1990 studyis the first to include the perspective of end-user organizations.andM;According to the AIIM, the end-user poll yielded some surprising results.andO;For example, while vendors were uniformly optimistic about the growth ofelectronic imaging users were even more sanguine, claiming that they plan tospend equally on micrographics and electronic imaging as early as the currentyear.andP;  Together the surveys led to forecast of steep growth rates for theindustry.andP;  Overall, the industry should grow at a compound annual rate of 34per cent over the next five years.andM;The 1990 industry study also polled users on what they felt were the greatestneeds in the marketplace today.andP;  Product-related improvements such asstandardization among vendors competed with service-related improvements suchas faster response time on service calls.andM;As far as price is concerned, the answer depended on the technology.andP;  Formicrographics, customers ranked price below features and benefits of a givensystem in importance.andP;  Cost is an issue, however, for electronic imaging.andO;Surprisingly, users do not view increased speed or increased reliability asan issue.andP;  Information and Image Management: The State of the Industry, 1990is available for $595 (U.S.) to members and $795 (U.S.) to non-members.andM;Lawrence Cragg is president of Information andamp; Control Systems based inToronto.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
