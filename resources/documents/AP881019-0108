Bush insisted he will ``fight like we're 10 points back''although public opinion surveys indicate a lead of that margin _not a deficit. The Dukakis campaign requested 30 minutes of paidtime on the television networks for an election-eve plea forsupport.   In Dearborn, Mich., the Republican nominee said the presidentand Congress should ``extend to each other the hand of partnership,not the finger of blame.'' He couldn't resist a shot at his rival,saying Dukakis' shortage of foreign policy experience has given him``a rather unrealistic view of American's role and the way in whichwe lead.''   Dukakis ``apparently believes that the Soviet economic problemshave left them too weak to make trouble,'' Bush said. ``The liberalMassachusetts governor seems to think that all we need to do isoffer Moscow economic inducements and a less agressive, lessthreatening Soviet Union will be the result.   ``He's wrong.''   Dukakis scorned Reagan-Bush administration agricultural policiesen route to a farm rally in Illinois. ``I don't remember any timein this campaign he's expressed any concern about family farmers.They (the Republicans) like corporate operators,'' he said.   Dukakis' ticket-mate, Lloyd Bentsen, accused the Republicanstoday of lowering the presidential race ``to the level of amud-wrestling'' contest.   ``They have viciously slandered the patriotism and record ofMichael Dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness andlight,'' he said in Palo Alto, Calif.   President Reagan continued to depict the Democrats as out oftouch. ``Where they want to take America, America doesn't want togo,'' Reagan said in Columbus, Ohio.   The map of today's campaigning looked like a strategy paper onkey battleground states. Michigan, Illinois, California and Ohiohold 114 electoral votes among them, a hefty chunk of the 270needed for election.   A Harris poll released today put the Bush-Dukakis gap nationwideat nine percentage points, with Bush ahead by 53 percent to 44percent. The survey, done Friday through Monday among 1,356 likelyvoters, had a margin of error of plus or minus three points. AHarris poll just a week ago indicated a race too close to call.   On Tuesday, Dukakis promised to erase the nation's $150 billiontrade deficit in four years. He also portrayed the election as achoice between a candidate for the wealthy and a nominee who iscommitted to working class Americans.   ``George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street. I careabout the people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on yourside,'' he said in Kalimazoo, Mich.   Dukakis also accused the Republican administration of failing tohalt the growing trade deficit and doing nothing to solve theproblems that led to the 1987 stock market crash, which occurredone year ago today.   The vice president, who traveled to Fulton, Mo., site of formerBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famed ``Iron Curtain''speech, focused on U.S.-Soviet relations in his address atWestminister College.   But in opening remarks to the students and comments toreporters, Bush sought to convince listeners he doesn't have thepresidential election in hand.   ``The worst thing to do would be to show a complacency I don'tfeel or an overconfidence that I do not feel,'' said the GOPnominee, who led by 17 points over in this week's NBC News-WallStreet Journal poll.   Bensten, who has hinted at dissatisfaction with his runningmate's limited response to GOP attacks, accused the Republicanticket of a ``vicious campaign that violates the public trust.''   ``They've said things about Mike Dukakis that in Texas wewouldn't say about a rattlesnake on a lawn at a church picnic,''Bentsen told about 2,000 students at the University of Californiaat Los Angeles.   For his part, Dukakis lashed out at Bush, charging that hisrival has ``no convictions, no ideas, no plans.''   ``We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red inkfor our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharpoperators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporateexecutives,'' Dukakis said.   The Massachusetts governor said his solution to the tradedeficit would be to reduce the budget deficit, increase foreigntrade, invest in education and training and place a greateremphasis on research and development.   While the candidate stepped up the offensive on the campaigntrail, Dukakis' ad chief said the campaign is releasing a networktelevision ad today criticizing Bush's plan to make Quayle thenation's drug czar.   ``If George Bush couldn't handle the job, how do you think DanQuayle is gonna do?'' the ad asks.   The vice president, expanding on his own campaign ad suggestingthat only the Republican nomine is experienced enough to negotiatewith the Soviets, told the Fulton audience he would remain wary ofSoviet intentions despite the reforms instituted under theleadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves theSoviet Union,'' Bush said.   Questioned about his claim that he will ``campaign like anunderdog,'' Bush said that his staff ``will not lighten up. We'regoing to stay right down to the wire. ... If I find anybody lettingup in my campaign, they're history.''   Quayle also was warning against overconfidence, but was upbeatafter greeting cheering college students in Illinois.   ``I'm beginning to feel what it's going to be like on electionnight,'' Quayle said.</TEXT></DOC>
