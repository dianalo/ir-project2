DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The former president of the failed GoldenPacific National Bank was sentenced to five years in prisonThursday for defrauding bank customers of $15 million through phonycertificates of deposit.   Kuang Hsung J. Chuang, 48, of Staten Island was convicted Jan.18 on 22 counts of making false statements to the Federal Reserve,misapplying bank funds and defrauding bank customers.   According to evidence at trial, Chuang, who was also chairman ofthe board, and the New York bank's former vice president andcashier, Theresa Shieh, 37, of Queens, sold tens of millions ofdollars in bogus certificates of deposit, called ``yellowcertificates,'' between 1980 and 1985.   Sales of the yellow certificates, so named because they wereprinted on yellow paper, were kept off the bank's books and hiddenfrom federal regulators.   The certificates were not federally insured and were used togenerate a multimillion dollar slush fund under Chaung and Ms.Shieh's control, unlike genuine certificates of deposit.   On June 21, 1985, the federal comptroller of the currencydeclared Golden Pacific insolvent and placed it in receivershipunder the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   About $15 million in yellow certificate funds were due customersat the time. After a court battle, the FDIC has been treating theyellow certificates as insured deposits and has been reimbursingcustomers.   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum is scheduled tosentence Ms. Shieh, who also was convicted, on June 12.</TEXT></DOC>
