The LHX program, estimated to cost more than $50 billion, consisted of two versions: a scout/attack helicopter for air-to-air combat and tank attacks, and a utility helicopter. Both would embody sophisticated features such as light composite materials and advanced aviation equipment. Amid the Pentagon's push to squeeze $33 billion out of its budget for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, the Army concluded that &quot;it's too expensive and we cannot afford it,&quot; said one officer.    Picking up the pieces from the project, the Army says it still wants to build a new scout/attack helicopter to replace the current aging fleet. Army officials are preparing a proposal on a substitute project for review by the Pentagon's Defense Acquisition Board.    One Pentagon official explained that the Army may call the new helicopter the LHX &quot;for its own internal reasons,&quot; but he added that the new aircraft will be much lighter and cheaper than the scout/attack helicopter planned under the costly program.    Two competing teams of contractors have been working on the LHX project: one is McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s helicopter unit and Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter subsidiary; the other consists of United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft division and Boeing Co.'s Boeing Vertol division. While the Army hasn't yet said what the successor scout/attack helicopter should look like, the four contractors would have a shot at working on the project.    In addition to developing a scaled-down scout/attack version, the Army will probably continue buying the McDonnell Douglas Apache attack helicopter. Under earlier plans, this project might have been halted to pay for the LHX. Pentagon officials also said the Army will probably refurbish its Vietnam-vintage utility helicopters to make up for the utility version of the LHX.    The LHX project has gone through many changes over the past three years, with the Army repeatedly shifting its cost estimates and design criteria. &quot;They just couldn't pin the tail on the donkey,&quot; said a Texas Instruments Corp. executive who had hoped his company could have a role in the project.    Meanwhile, as budget strains worsened, Army officials worried that the LHX would drain other programs. &quot;I worried that we wouldn't have been able to afford rifles for the Army,&quot; said one officer. Funding pressures have also forced the Army to chop 10,000 active-duty troops form its total force of 781,000. </TEXT></DOC>
