Prices of actively traded Treasury bonds, which were down about three-eighths of a point early in the day, finished with gains of one point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bonds dropped to 8.76% from 8.86% Tuesday.    But most short-term interest rates rose, and speculation is building that banks in coming weeks may raise their prime lending rate, which has stood at 8 1/2% since early February, to 8 3/4%. Analysts say part of the increase in short-term rates was caused by temporary technical factors. But many also agree that the Federal Reserve System is tightening credit slightly in an effort to bolster the dollar and emphasize its determination to keep inflation subdued.    &quot;I think the evidence is fairly convincing the Fed has tightened&quot; credit, said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor and now chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.    Fed officials haven't said explicitly whether they have changed policy. But conversations with Fed officials early this week suggest that the central bank is reversing the move toward lower interest rates that it made in January. Moreover, the federal funds rate, one of the most closely watched gauges of Fed policy, has increased in the past three days.    Now, the big question is how much of a move the Fed has made and where the funds rate will settle. Mr. Gramley and many other analysts contend that the Fed move is relatively small. They expect the federal funds rate to hover around 6 3/4%, up from an average of 6 1/2% to 6 5/8% in recent weeks.    The funds rate averaged 7.22% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up from 6.83% Tuesday and 6.71% Monday. But bankers noted that yesterday was the final day of a two-week period in which banks must settle their reserve positions. The funds rate often is especially volatile in the last few days of bank settlement periods. Thus, bankers say a truer test of the funds rate will come tomorrow when a new statement period begins.    &quot;I think it's too early&quot; to expect a prime rate increase, said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;The run-up in the interest rates that tend to enter into banks' calculations of whether to change the prime rate has been relatively recent.&quot; But he said that if the funds rate continues to hover close to 7%, speculation about a prime rate boost will intensify, especially because business loan demand &quot;seems stronger.&quot;    Two banks yesterday increased their broker-loan rates, the rate on loans backed by stock. Bankers Trust Co. raised its rate to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%, while U.S. Trust Co. increased its rate to 8% from 7 3/4%.    The bond rally illustrated once again the enormous influence of the foreign exchange markets on the U.S. bond market. Bond traders view a stronger dollar as good news because it could help keep inflation under control. A rising dollar also could encourage foreign investors to increase their holdings of dollar-denominated securities.    The dollar's rebound came after news reports that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will reaffirm a dollar stabilization pact. The Group of Seven, known as G-7, is scheduled to meet next week.    Nevertheless, many economists remain convinced the dollar is heading lower, mainly because they expect the U.S. trade deficit to remain enormous. The government is scheduled to release its trade deficit report for February one week from today.    The most actively traded long-term bonds, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017, were quoted late yesterday at 101 6/32, up from 100 6/32 Tuesday. That is exactly where the issue closed last Thursday. The credit markets were closed Friday.    Bond prices tumbled Monday as traders reacted to a Labor Department report released Friday showing unexpectedly large gains in employment last month. That report rekindled fears that inflation will accelerate, leading to higher interest rates. Some traders also expressed concern about protectionist trade legislation now making its way through Congress that could add to inflation pressures.    But the dollar's rally helped ease those fears yesterday. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 10.01 points, the largest one-day advance since Feb. 5, to 1272.53. It closed near its high for the day of 1273.21. The low was 1258.24.    &quot;Fears of an imminent run-up in the rate of inflation are misdirected,&quot; contended Mr. Kellner. He argues that recent increases in interest rates represent nothing more than a temporary blip. He also contends that investors have exaggerated the economy's strength. He argues that the economy already has slipped into a recession that will last throughout the year, leading to lower interest rates. For example, he predicts the yield on long-term Treasury bonds will drop about three-quarters of a percentage point by year end to 8%.    Mr. Kellner's recession forecast puts him at odds with the vast majority of economists in several recent surveys. Most contend the economy will continue expanding at least through the end of this year.    The Federal Reserve yesterday injected reserves into the banking system by arranging repurchase agreements. At the time, the funds rate was 7 1/16%. The move was widely expected and thus didn't have much effect on the markets. Separately, the Fed purchased Treasury notes and bonds in a maneuver known as a &quot;coupon pass&quot; that also had been expected by many traders.    The government's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 rose to 97 1/32 from 96 7/32. The yield dropped to 8.57% from 8.65%.    The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills rose to 6.03% bid from 5.96%. But the rate on the latest six-month bills fell to 6.16% from 6.21%. </TEXT></DOC>
