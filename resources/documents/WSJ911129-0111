Hobbs's Nov. 8 letter to the editor aboutair bags contained some errors. The most glaring is his claimthat air bags are &quot;not effective&quot; at speeds above 38 milesper hour. This is utterly false, as many motorists -- happily-- can attest. For example, in 1981, the dual air bags in a1975 Oldsmobile saved a woman and her 81-year-old mother(both unbelted) in a head-on crash with a loaded oil tanker.Both vehicles were going 50 mph upon impact. The Olds, beingsmaller and lighter, took the brunt of the force. The womenhad no life-threatening injuries. If that is not effective,what is?   Prof. Hobbs further asserts that the five-point racingharness is the &quot;ideal arrangement.&quot; But it would not preventthe &quot;third collision&quot; of the brain impacting the inside ofthe skull, when the torso is restrained and the head whipsviolently forward. Thus, the &quot;closed&quot; head injury -- anall-too-common occurrence in moderate- and higher-speedcrashes. Air bags cushion the head, slow the deceleration andprovide unique protection for the brain. Prof. Hobbs's&quot;either/or&quot; mentality is outmoded. The combination of seatbelt and air bag is best, a fact now widely accepted by boththe safety community and the auto industry.</LP><TEXT>   Finally, he says air bags work only in frontal crashes.True enough. But not for long. Auto companies in Europe, theU.S. and Japan are developing air bags that will inflate inside collisions.   On the subject of air bags, perhaps the good professorshould take a refresher course from his university's mostfamous alumnus -- Lee Iacocca.
