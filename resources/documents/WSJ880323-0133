Sen. Nunn made a similar proposal recently.    It is important to bring to the attention of the American people the fact that this badly needed protection cannot be obtained within the limits of the ABM treaty. According to the combined technical judgment of the members of the Marshall Institute Panel on Missile Defense, the reasons are:   1) A defense that complies with the ABM treaty must use ground-based interceptors -- heat-seeking missiles or &quot;smart bullets&quot; -- that are fired up at the nuclear warheads as they descend toward the U.S. The ERIS type of interceptor would do the job, and already is being developed. However, ERIS missiles cannot protect the entire continental U.S. unless they are used in combination with the network of early warning radars set up by the U.S. to warn of missile attacks. But the use of early warning radars for this purpose is explicitly forbidden by the ABM treaty.    2) The &quot;smart bullet&quot; interceptors must be located at multiple sites on or near the East and West coasts, in addition to inland locations, to protect against nuclear missiles launched from offshore submarines. (A different kind of &quot;smart bullet,&quot; such as HEDI, that can intercept warheads at low altitudes is also needed. Submarine-launched missiles on flat trajectories could fly under the ERIS defense.) A defense that leaves the populations of New York, Los Angeles and other coastal cities exposed to destruction is not acceptable. But interceptors at many sites are forbidden by the ABM treaty, which allows them at only one site.    3) Hundreds or thousands of ground-based interceptors are needed to protect against an accidental launch. An accidental launch is usually thought of as one or two missiles, but an accidental launch from one Soviet submarine could mean 180 warheads and a thousand decoys -- all headed for the U.S. But the ABM treaty limits the U.S. to 100 interceptors.    4) Even this robust accidental-launch defense (early warning radars, ERIS and HEDI, multiple sites and numerous interceptors) leaves America's allies unprotected. Full protection for the U.S. and its allies requires that the ground-based defenses be backed up by a global space-based defense -- smart bullets stored on satellites instead of on the ground, and available to intercept a missile launched anywhere in the world, toward any country, at any time.    The president made a very important reference to the need for a space-based layer in the accidental launch protection system in his March 14 speech on SDI. He said that a Phase I missile defense -- the defense already being developed by the Defense Department -- &quot;will protect the population of the U.S. and its allies against an accidental launch.&quot; The Phase I defense consists of a space-based layer and a ground-based layer. It is, as the president noted, the minimum defense that will protect all 50 states and the territories of our allies.    The space-based defense also is needed to protect America's allies from the deliberate launch of a number of medium-range nuclear missiles. This is a growing and fearsome threat to our friends in Europe, the Middle East and Asia as missile technology spreads to the Third World.    The problem of the accidental launch, or of a deliberate Third World launch, has been with us for several years. I think it is a tribute to the leadership of the president and Sen. Nunn that, although they differ on some defense matters, both have been willing to grasp this nettle.    James J. Frelk   Executive Director   George C. Marshall Institute   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
