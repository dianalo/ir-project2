Or do I just receive a snapshot of source files so thatediting won't affect data integrity? These questions haven't been decided.andM;Neither has the question of source file location.andP;  If the source file moves,is the new location relayed to each document that references it? Or does theold location have to indicate die new one? You might wonder why you can'tjust mail the entire compound document, complete with all referenceddocuments.andP;  It is an option, but not a very good one, because duplicatingfiles and thus wasting storage space is too demanding on system resources.andM;ELECTRONIC DATA EXCHANGE.andP;  Perhaps the most promising E-mail opportunity iselectronic data interchange (EDI).andP;  Ideally, two applications should be ableto use mail to communicate and exchange data.andP;  EDI is already heavily usedfor purchasing and financial transactions, but it's also an interestingprospect for the commercial market Consider, for instance, this automatedchain of events:andM;* I register via an E-mail form for a conference being sponsored by yourcompany.andM;* Your company has an application that fields electronic conferenceregistrations and routes a copy of my registration form to billing as well asto the conference administration.andM;A conference administration program extracts from the registration form theinformation it needs (such as name, tide, address, company, phone number,etc.), automatically updates the conference database, generates aregistration verification message, and sends the verification back to me.andM;Meanwhile, a billing application updates the accounts receivable file,generates an invoice, and sends the invoice out.andP;  Not a bad way to dobusiness, eh? In this case, EDI is the basis for a sophisticated proceduralautomation program.andP;  At each step of the procedure described above, mail canbe used to transport the necessary messages, data, and binaries.andP;  The basicbenefit of EDI is reducing the time needed to do business.andP;  In addition, EDIoffers a variety of internal management benefits.andP;  For example, amultidivisional company might build an EDI routing agent to fieldtransactions for all of its divisions, reducing the redundancy that resultswhen each division has its own order-entry point.andM;ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES.andP;  E-mail for distributed environments is, by nature, aclient/server-based, store-and-forward technology.andP;  To accommodate users onremote servers and long-distance workgroups, a server-to-server architectureis appropriate for E-mail.andP;  It's also the typical configuration you'll findin distributed architectures: Multiple servers, rather than some big,centralized machine, make up the computing engine.andP;  Server-to-serverenvironments have a lot going for them: They're easily expandable Oust addanother server), and they're dependable (a single server might crash, but itwon't affect the others).andM;Store-and-forward messaging is a foundation for E-mail in a server-to-serverarchitecture.andP;  If a connection is not established immediately, your mailserver stores your message and waits for the connection.andP;  This is areasonable solution for multiserver messaging, because users don't have tophysically retry a connection over and over again if the another serverhappens to be down.andP;  However, from an application communication perspective,we should note that store-and-forward is not appropriate for certainapplications, such as mission-critical applications, where a connection needsto be made immediately.andP;  Thus, E-mail is best for applications where theimmediacy of a connection is much less an issue than the time saved infinishing a procedure.andM;OTHER OPTIONS.andP;  There are other approaches for inter-applicationcommunication, and we should compare them to the Email approach.andM;Application-Integration Environments.andP;  Application-integration environmentshave a lot of momentum right now.andP;  Examples are the dynamic data interchange(DDE) protocol for Windows and Presentation Manager  PM), and Apple'sInterApplication Communication (IAC) protocol, which will be released withSystem 7.0.andP;  The Object Management Group (OMG) should soon have one, too; astandard application-integration environment is one of OMG's primary goals.andO;Such technologies let users create live links to different applications overthe network.andP;  In essence, integrated applications can ask each other if theycan share any information, and the protocol sets up the mechanism to pass thedata.andM;These environments have been designed for different platforms: DDE is a DOSand OS/2 facility (however, DOS DDE applications cannot exchange data withOS/2 DDE applications); IAC is only for the Macintosh.andP;  The OMG, however, islooking at DOS, OS/2, and Unix environments.andP;  Office Systems.andP;  You alreadyknow how proprietary office systems work; the applications come with theenvironment, and their level of integration varies from vendor to vendor.andO;Some office systems, such as the Alis system (from Applix for Unixplatforms), feature compound document architectures; others only let you cutE-Mail Pros.andP;  Application-integration environments and office systems at bestprovide a handshake among applications: A word processing document may borrowa spreadsheet; a spreadsheet ma borrow an image.andP;  Mail-enabled applicationshave a different purpose.andP;  They tend to be procedural, and they depend on themail service for a number of functions: routing capabilities, gateways toexternal mail systems, directory services, library services, access control,logging, and document translation.andP;  Since, conceptually, these services areleft up to the mail system, application developers don't have to incorporateadditional network services; they just have to write to the mail system'sAPIS.andP;  (For a look at the services E-mail needs to offer as an applicationenabler, see Illustration 1.)andM;And if developers are more comfortable with E-mail, consider how users andadministrators feel about it.andP;  They already use and administer E-mail all thetime.andP;  It's not some sophisticated, alien technology; it's good ol' E-mail.andO;And Cons.andP;  Before you get too excited about sending off messages to users andapplications, you have to consider the obstacles.andP;  We've already mentionedthat some applications are unsuitable for mail-enabling.andP;  But applicationincompatibilities are also in the way.andP;  Surely, gateways help by connectingto external messaging systems, but how do you deal with diverseapplications-and hardware, for that matter? And what about consistent routingand addressing? How are users to deal with addressing in very large,entangled networks? You might turn to ISO standards, and they will help ...andO;eventually.andP;  Those trying to implement an X.400 addressing solution arepulling their hair out trying to set it up.andP;  The standard is both complex andlimiting, and many feel that vendors have been premature in offering it.andP;  TheX.500 directory standard is promising, but very much in an embryonic state.andM;How MS Mail Stacks UpandM;We can't honestly say that MS Mail is the enabler we described above.andP;  On theother hand, it's a sophisticated product, and we're especially impressed withthe strides it has made in application integration and communication.andP;  MSMail provides the traditional electronic mail capabilities of sending andreceiving messages and file attachments.andP;  (See &quot;The MS Mail Environment.&quot;)andO;But, more to the point, MS Mail has been coupled with a few developmentenvironments to provide tools for building distributed mail-enabledapplications.andP;  Microsoft has released MS Mail extensions for HyperCard stacksand Excel macros.andP;  Another set of extensions is available from AciusCorporation for 4th Dimension 4D), a Macintosh database product.andP;  Microsoftrefers to these extensions as software development kits (SDKs), but theyconstitute only one of three SDK types that Microsoft offers.andP;  The other twoare sets of APIs for third-party integration: one for applications and onefor gateway development.andP;  Obviously, Microsoft assumes that, as long as itprovides the APIs-or SDKs, as the case may be-third parties will do the work.andO;While it can be risky if ISVs don't participate, we agree that SDKs are apractical approach to third-party integration.andM;But the product trips over interoperability.andP;  MS Mail is strapped toAppleTalk networks, and, although it has a PC client, it's definitely aMacintosh-conceived product Microsoft is positioning MS Mail as a solutionfor the enterprise, but its Mac focus can only limit the product, becauseApple products haven't exactly taken corporate environments by storm.andM;MARKETING STRATEGY.andP;  When you talk to Microsoft about its goals for MS Mail,you hear a bit more about its server-to-server architecture than you do aboutapplication communication.andP;  Microsoft is promoting MS Mail as a messagingsystem for multiserver workgroups.andP;  But the product is far more interestingas a basis for application communication and, as such, a means of exchangingdata and applications among these multi-server workgroups.andM;Educating the Market.andP;  Microsoft's focus may have to do with the difficultyof driving home die concept of mail as the communication architecture we'vebeen talking about.andP;  Again, most users think of E-mail as an application forsending text messages to co-workers on a LAN.andP;  Electronic mail as an enableris a hard thing for users to get their arms around, and manyorganizations-especially the smaller ones-believe that they don't need suchsophisticated technology.andP;  Talking about MS Mail's multiserver structure isprobably an easier sell.andM;In the meantime, Microsoft is strongly encouraging Macintosh ISVs tointegrate applications into mail by providing additional ISV support inaddition to the third-party application SDK.andP;  The more third parties thatintegrate into MS Mail, the easier marketing will be, because once usersactually see applications integrated into MS Mail, they get more excitedabout it.andP;  Applications can be integrated at various levels: anywhere fromthe ability to invoke MS Mail from within the application to an MS Mailextension of the development environment for creating mail-enabledapplications (a la Excel, HyperCard, and 4D).andP;  Most third parties fallsomewhere in between.andP;  Microsoft estimates that as many as 60 products and 35corporate applications have either integrated or are in the process ofintegrating with MS Mail.andM;Targeting Apple Customers.andP;  Since MS Mail is such a Macintosh-orientedproduct, Microsoft is marketing it exactly where you'd expect: big Mac usersites.andP;  Apple itself is one of the largest MS Mail customers, along withuniversities and Apple's corporate accounts.andP;  The cost of MS Mail iscomparable to most LAN E-mail systems.andP;  For $395, you can buy software for asingle server and one workstation (PC or Mac), and a 20-node system costs$1,495.andP;  Microsoft's AppleLink gateway costs $295.andP;  SDK prices can run ashigh as $445(for gateway and application SDKS).andM;ARCHITECTURAL UNDERPINNINGS.andP;  MS Mail had undergone a complete overhaul whenits second version was released last year.andP;  Architecturally, Microsoft zeroedin on three major issues that it felt were insufficiently addressed by otherelectronic mail vendors for distributed environments:andM;* Enhanced server-to-server communications and message-storingandM;* Gateways for connecting to external messaging systems, including commercialsystems such as MCI Mail or SprintMailandM;* Support for mixed hardwareandM;Transparent Server-to-Server Communication.andP;  Like other E-mail systems, MSMail is a store-and-forward service for server communications.andP;  Microsoftenhanced MS Mail's serverto-server implementation by making addressingtransparent via what Microsoft calls a global directory-exchange.andP;  Eachserver broadcasts its directory of usernames and addresses to other MS Mailservers as soon as it is brought up, or when users are added, deleted, ormoved.andP;  It's automade; administrators only need to maintain the directory ontheir own servers.andP;  (Gateway users must be added individually.andP;  See&quot;Gateways&quot; below.) Thus, a current global directory is compiled on eachserver.andM;While the directory-exchange helps administrators manage the mail system, inthe end, it benefits end users.andP;  Since addresses are included in the globaldirectory, the software looks up addresses and sends messages accordingly.andO;Users only have to supply a username.andP;  The directory-exchange spares usersfrom rummaging through system directories to find user locations (in somecases, you have to exit the mail environment to view directories-what ahassle!) that sometimes included a long, convoluted address.andO;Store-and-forward also helps users by retrying a message if need be until aconnection is made.andM;A problem with storing global directories on each server is that directoriestake up so much room on the system.andP;  Apparently, Microsoft feels that addresstransparency is worth the storage space.andP;  We agree-especially as networksbecome larger and more complicated.andM;Database Message-Storing.andP;  MS Mail has adopted a database scheme for storingmessages.andP;  Servers store only a single copy of each message in a special maildatabase-regardless of its number of recipients.andP;  An index in memory pointsto the messages stored on disk, and die database is automatically compressedas messages are deleted.andM;MS Mail is by no means the only mail system that uses a database rather thana traditional file system for storing messages.andP;  In fact, the file systemoption is rapidly becoming obsolete because it stores a copy per recipient ofeach message.andP;  This method, as Microsoft points out, not only wastes storagespace, it also ties up CPU time while copying messages.andP;  Furthermore, withthe database implementation, the operating system deals with only onefile-the mail database file-no matter how many messages may be in the system.andM;Gateways.andP;  Realizing the importance of connecting to other mail systems,Microsoft has made gateways an important aspect of its mail strategy.andP;  Thecompany has developed a gateway for AppleLink, Apple's public E-mail andbulletin board network.andP;  However, Microsoft thought it unreasonable to builda gateway for every messaging system out there, and so is relying on its SDKto encourage third parties to build consistent MS Mail gateways.andM;The SDK strategy seems to be working.andP;  SDKs started shipping just last March,and a number of vendors have announced MS Mail gateway products.andP;  Among themare:andM;* Alisa Systems (Pasadena, California) and Pacer Software Westboro,Massachusetts), both with VAX Mail servers that gateway to VMS-mail,All-In-1, and Digital's Message Router, which connects to X.400.andM;* StarNine Technologies (Berkeley, California), with a Message HandlingSystem (MHS) gateway (scheduled to ship by the year's end), and a gateway forSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is used by most Unix systems inTCP/IP environments.andP;  SNM, in turn, is supported by PROFS, VMSmail, All-In-1,Data General's AOS/VS, and Up DeskMate.andM;* Cayman Systems (Cambridge, Massachusetts), also with an SMTP gateway.andM;* Soft-Switch (Wayne, Pennsylvania), with a gateway to its Central networkbackbone, which exchanges mail with users of DISOSS, PROFS, AllIn-1, WangOffice, HP Desk, and X.400-compliant systems.andM;* Solutions Incorporated (Burlington, Vermont), with an MCI Mail gateway anda gateway to its FAXgate program.andM;* Touch Communications (Campbell, California), with an X.400 gateway that wasdeveloped jointly with Microsoft.andM;* Infosphere Incorporated (Portland, Oregon), with a gateway for Liaison, itsAppleTalk router.andM;From an administrator's perspective, communication between external mailsystems is not as transparent as it is between MS Mail servers-although it isfor users.andP;  The directory exchange is for MS Mail servers only.andP;  Generallyspeaking, gateway directories must be added by the administrator.andP;  (SDKgateways may make use of a gateway name utility for including gatewayaccounts on the global directory.) Once gateway accounts are added, though,an MS Mail user can send and receive messages without leaving the MS Mailenvironment, and distribution groups can be made up of both MS Mail andgateway accounts.andP;  Again, the addresses are included in the user directory,so, as long as a gateway account exists in MS Mail, the mailing processdoesn't require any additional address lines.andM;Peer-to-Peer Gateways.andP;  Microsoft claims its peer-to-peer gateway design isdifferent than most designs that use scripted bridges.andP;  It provides a fullseven-layer protocol connection between servers.andP;  Gateways as DistributedNetwork Links.andP;  Your organization may have very remote sites that useseparate networks.andP;  Ideally, you could be on a network in New Jersey andcommunicate transparently with someone on a site in Montana (or Belgium, forthat matter).andP;  The distance, though, can get in the way.andP;  However, if yourorganization also subscribes to an external commercial mail service (e.g.,andO;MCI Mail, Telenet), you could use it.andP;  to link the separate MS Mail networks.andO;The external mail service acts as a central exchange through which theseparate MS Mail networks transfer messages.andP;  (See Illustration 2.)andM;This scheme takes a bit of administrative work because the gateways need tobe configured for the different MS Mail networks and because accounts forevery user at both sites need to be established.andP;  Users, on the other hand,never need to be aware of the gateways; they send and receive messagesdirectly from within MS Mail.andM;Mixed Hardware Support.andP;  The advantage to supporting mixed hardwareenvironments is obvious.andP;  Even most traditionally proprietary vendorsrecognize that they won't get anywhere with a proprietary networkinfrastructure when the most critical aspect of the emerging market is theneed for multivendor interconnection and interoperability.andM;Microsoft is quick to point out that MS Mail supports both PC and Macclients.andP;  However, the fact that it runs on AppleTalk networks means that theserver will most likely be a Macintosh-either Plus, SE, or II.andP;  Frankly, mostcorporate environments don't use Mac servers (except perhaps for specialgroups that share Macintosh applications).andM;Another option is to use a third-party VAX MS Mail server.andP;  Two thirdparties-Pacer Software and Alisa Systems-have written MS Mail servers for theVAX.andP;  A VAX is a more appropriate server than a Mac because it has higherperformance and security, and more manageable message backup and serveradministration.andP;  Furthermore, administrators can pair user population andmessage volume with a properly-sized CPU.andP;  VAX MS Mail servers are completelycompatable with Mac MS Mail servers, providing all the necessary services andcooperating with other MS Mail servers on the network.andP;  VAX MS Mail serversparticipate in the global directory-exchange, so the connection istransparent and easy for the administrator.andM;MS Mail clients can be either Macs or PCs, yet Macs fit the product muchbetter.andP;  For instance, the MS Mail application APIs (see &quot;Third-PartyApplications&quot; below) are for Mac applications only.andP;  And you can't sendimages and voice to PCs as you can to other Macs.andP;  Microsoft blames suchlimitations on PC inadequacies-an ironic statement coming from the companythat invented the de facto PC operating system.andP;  We're disappointed thatMicrosoft hasn't figured out a way to better support the PC.andP;  FileConversion.andP;  A problem surfaces in tying together Mac and PC clients: fileconversion.andP;  And the problem becomes all the more menacing the morethird-party applications enter the picture.andP;  For the most part, MS Mailrecognizes file formats and transmits files from Macs to PCs with theirformatting intact.andP;  Take an Excel spreadsheet: You can have a WKS spreadsheetsent from a PC, open the file in Excel at your Macintosh, and you're on yourway.andP;  However, many applications that support Macs and PCs don't transfer sosmoothly, and many Mac applications don't have PC counterparts at all (andvice versa).andP;  These must be sent as ASCII files.andP;  Applications  both existingand future) that have been integrated with MS Mail at a very high level maylose their integration altogether on a different machine.andP;  Images and voicedon't transmit at all except Mac-toMac.andP;  Furthermore, it's up to the user tofigure out who has a PC, who has a Mac, and whether or not the applicationfiles are transferable.andP;  Likewise, when sending to a gateway account, theuser must designate how an attachment is to be sent.andP;  Microsoft is promotingMS Mail as a multiserver system that could contain thousands of users.andP;  Whatare users to do? Send a message to see how they should attach a file toanother message? Doubtful.andP;  It seems to us that there is great potential fora lot of plain old text-based message-passing.andP;  If mail systems are to evolveas Microsoft envisions, this issue needs to be addressed.andP;  STANDARDS.andP;  MSMail itself is not yet X.400 compliant.andP;  Instead, it offers an X.400 gateway.andO;This seems pragmatic enough.andP;  At the moment, most users want a standard wayto connect external mail systems-mainly public mail systems like MCI Mait-andthe gateway will buy them that.andP;  However, as X.400 develops, users will wantfull compliancy, and Microsoft is &quot;considering&quot; developing an X.400-compliantMS Mail server.andP;  However, it made no mention of providing X.500 support, norof an X.500 gateway product.andP;  While X.500 may be immature, it holds promise,and users are enthusiastic about it.andP;  It's certainly not a standard Microsoftcan ignore.andM;MESSAGE ROUTING.andP;  MS Mail depends almost entirely on AppleTalk services formessage routing.andP;  AppleTalk is datagram network, as opposed to avirtual-circuit network.andP;  The difference: A virtual circuit network keepscontinuous connections among servers; a datagram network sends packets to theappropriate server whenever it needs a connection.andP;  The impact:andM;The datagram network tends to be more flexible because it doesn't require apreestablished connection.andM;Last year, Apple extended AppleTalk's addressing to support up to 16 millionnodes.andP;  Also, AppleTalk now features an Internet router for larger networkingschemes.andP;  The router is a software package that runs in the background on anyMac and provides the internetworking between combinations of LocalTalk(Apple's low-end networking solution), EtherTalk (its Ethernet solution), andTokenTalk (its token-ring solution) networks.andP;  In addition, the routersupports redundant route topologies for rerouting traffic around failures.andO;It also provides Zone Multicast on EtherTalk and TokenTalk networks, whichallows a message to be sent to a particular (logical or physical) zone only,thereby reducing the overhead caused by broadcasts.andM;Microsoft itself hasn't really addressed routing.andP;  Aside from AppleTalkservices, MS Mail allows the creation of global group names that servers canuse to direct messages.andP;  Global group names are similar to network domains;they specify a group and its address on the network.andP;  The problem is that youcan't use existing network domains; new ones for MS Mail must be created.andO;For a large network, this is really not workable.andP;  Routing tables are anoption.andP;  They coordinate locations and addresses and let you know the mostefficient route between two locations.andP;  But Microsoft isn't gung ho aboutrouting tables, either, because the system winds up looking through routingtables even for local delivery.andP;  Microsoft hinted at plans to improve routingfor the next release of MS Mail.andP;  Ideally, the company would like to providemultihop routing (i.e.andP;  sending a message via a number of servers) and keepaddressing easy for users.andP;  We're anxious to see what Microsoft comes upwith.andM;Server-to-server communication, store-and-forward messaging, support for Macand VAX servers, gateways-these are all very well and good.andP;  But what sets MSMail apart from other mail packages is application integration.andP;  We'vealready mentioned that integration varies from application to application.andO;Perhaps Microsoft's own products best reflect these variations.andM;WAITING FOR COMPOUND DOCUMENT SUPPORT.andP;  Microsoft Word ties in nicely with MSMail.andP;  You can send and receive messages and documents while you're workingon a Word document by selecting Send Mail or Open Mail from the main menu.andM;However, the most likely role for E-mail in document processing is forcompound document exchange, and the current Mac environment prevents using MSMail in this context.andP;  With MS-Windows on the PC, Microsoft uses DDE tocombine data from Word and Excel and then transmit it electronically.andP;  InMS-Windows, you can, for instance, send a Word document that contains a chartgenerated from Excel and have your recipient update both the document and theExcel data.andM;However, there is still no equivalent for DDE on the Mac.andP;  Microsoft is,thus, anxiously awaiting the delayed arrival of Mac OS 7.0 and its IACcomponent, which will allow users to create live links to differentapplications over AppleTalk networks.andP;  System 7.0 is scheduled for release bythe year's end, and Microsoft intends to take advantage of it in much thesame way it has of DDE.andM;EXTENDING EXCEL.andP;  Excel integration goes much deeper.andP;  The Excel SDK extendsExcel's macro language to let users incorporate MS Mail functionality intomacro programs.andP;  This is actually pretty impressive.andP;  You can write Excelmacros to create small, distributed applications and automate proceduresacross the network.andM;To illustrate, Microsoft describes a daily report distribution applicationthat the company itself uses internally.andP;  Excel goes to MS Mail to retrievestock quotes from financial bulletin boards on public message systems,generates a chart of the figures it receives, and then routes it to an MSMail distribution list.andP;  The procedure has been programmed by Excel macrosand automatically runs every day.andM;Excel's macros offer a fair amount of intelligence.andP;  They let you setprespecified data values (i.e., to determine when a critical margin has beenreached) and can even incorporate rules to perform deductive reasoning.andO;(They can also do some if-then-else processing and can call on C processesfor more sophisticated functionality.) You can even add menus and dialogboxes to create an interactive macro.andP;  Most importantly, with the Excel SDK,you can add MS Mail functionality.andP;  In the end, what you have is anagent-like capability that end users can program to reach networkedinformation or to piece together networked tasks.andP;  Or, at least, eager userscan.andP;  Excel macros like most advanced macro languages, require learning asophisticated syntax and gaining an excellent understanding of theapplication involved.andM;Third-Party IntegrationandM;THE HYPERCARD CONNECTION.andP;  HyperCard applications also get a boost from MSMail.andP;  The HyperCard SDK lets HyperCard stacks send and receive messages andshare and interconnect pieces of information across AppleTalk networks.andP;  MSMail gives HyperCard applications the same kind of flexibility that it givesExcel macros-functionality for distributed applications-except thatHyperCard, of course, has the advantage of being an advanced and completeprogramming environment.andP;  In fact, Microsoft has implemented HyperCard todrive MS Mail's forms environment.andM;Forms.andP;  HyperCard makes MS Mail's forms environment very rich, becauseHyperCard developers can write scripts for extra forms processing.andP;  In otherwords, information on a form can be incorporated into HyperCard applications.andO;HyperCard fields may be linked to MS Mail fields, so that informationcontained in HyperCard applications can be updated via MS Mail.andP;  Form fieldscan also update Excel data.andP;  Of course, the processing would have to comefrom either Excel or HyperCard (through the SDKS); the forms environmentalone doesn't have this kind of functionality.andM;Aside from its HyperCard foundation, one of the things that impresses us mostabout MS Mail's forms environment is the very fact that it's included in thepackage.andP;  To us, it's always made sense to couple a forms-design tool withE-mail.andP;  Think about it: You're in control of the form; you can break itdown, and have it automatically routed so that the people in, say, themanufacturing department receive via E-mail the section that they mustspecifically deal with, and the product designers receive only the sectionthat pertains to them.andP;  MS Mail integration makes forms processingconsiderably more effective.andM;However, this tool isn't robust enough to take on full-fledged proceduralautomation capabilities itself.andP;  Yes, you might be able to break the formdown and route it to the correct departments, but you can't bring it backtogether.andP;  Nor can a purchase requisition form be dynamically routed so thatit would go to an accountant if the amount were less than  2,000 or to asupervisor for approval if it were more.andP;  HyperCard extensions might let youdo that with some tricky scripting, but die MS Mail forms tool won't.andP;  Thelack of database support also cripples the tool.andP;  You can link form fields toExcel fields to update Excel data.andP;  Or, again, you may be able to useHyperCard scripts as a go-between for corporate data stored in HyperCardapplications.andP;  However, so that forms can be used to update information andenter records, most forms packages have--connections to popular databases.andO;So should Microsoft's.andM;INTEGRATING ISV AND EXISTING APPLICATIONS.andP;  MS Mail's Macintosh ProgrammersWorkshop in C(MPW C) SDK allows third-party and existing home-grown Macintoshapplications to be integrated into MS Mail.andP;  This SDK supplies documentationand run-time libraries of MS Mail commands.andP;  Developers can modify MS Mail'sfront end, leaving the core communication engine intact (for routing, dataexchange, etc.).andP;  In other words, other applications can maintain theirfamiliar interface, but use MS Mail as a store-and-forward communicationengine.andM;At a minimum, any third-party application can integrate at the StandardIntegration with Microsoft Mail (SIMM) level.andP;  SIMM compliancy means MS Mailcan be invoked from within the application-like Word, for instance.andP;  However,most of Microsoft's ISV examples have gone beyond the SIMM level.andP;  AldusPageMaker, for one, includes a Place Mail command, which places an MS Mailmessage as an enclosure (or attachment) to a PageMaker document.andM;Although PageMaker is the best-known application to implement SIMM, it's byno means the only one.andP;  Pharos Technology (Cincinatti, Ohio), for example,has built a network monitoring tool that uses MS Mail as its engine.andP;  Theproduct, StatusMac, provides a network status report by taking a snapshot ofeach Mac on the network (e.g., the machine's system software, version number,etc.), compiling the results, and then forwarding a compiled report back tothe administrator.andP;  Another product, Syzygy, a task management program fromInformation Research (Charlottesville, Virginia), uses MS Mail toautomatically generate appropriate messages when a wrinkle occurs in a taskflow.andP;  Microsoft has a handful of other ISV examples, ranging fromvoice-trained macros that use MS Mail's voice messaging to forms packagesthat use MS Mail for routing capabilities.andM;While these applications are actual products, there is no reason why MS Mailcannot be similarly applied to transform existing applications intonetwork-aware applications.andM;WHAT ABOUT CORPORATE DATA? We're not sure that SDKs are the right method forlinking MS Mail to corporate data.andP;  At the very least, you'd like to be ableto access E-mail from the corporate database.andP;  But, ideally, you'd like touse E-mail to forward new information to the database, or as a means forcollecting and routing the results of complex queries.andM;These are the kinds of tasks that the 4D SDK from Acius Corporation allows.andO;As with the Excel and HyperCard SDKS, 4D developers can reach MS Mailfunctions while creating database applications.andP;  For example, they can writea daily query report that is automatically routed to a specific department-orto another database table (e.g., forwarding the results of, say, a customeraccount report to update records in a billing table).andM;The 4D SDK is certainly powerful.andP;  If only a similar tool were available forthe Oracles, Ingreses, and Sybases of the world.andP;  That's where most corporatedata is stored.andP;  We recommend that Microsoft develop relationships with themore popular RDBMSs out there, if not by providing an SDK itself, then byconvincing a third party to provide one.andP;  ConclusionsandM;FUTURES.andP;  Microsoft is tight when it comes to divulging specific plans for MSMail.andP;  The company intends to continue enhancing the architecture of MSMail-to make it more robust and scalable.andP;  We inferred that Microsoft mayincrease the number of gateway offerings and/or port the server to differentplatforms.andP;  Or at least motivate third parties to do so.andP;  The company istalking about an X.400 server.andP;  Other than that, we couldn't get any serverdetails.andM;Microsoft also plans to upgrade the MS Mail client MS Mail is currentlymissing a few features that you might expect it to include (see &quot;The MailEnvironment').andP;  However, the company promises to remedy many of itsshortcomings in the near future.andP;  Mail for LAN Manager? You may have heardreports that Microsoft and Consumers Software are gearing up for the jointrelease of a messaging system (based on Consumers' Network Courier, not MSMail) for LAN Manager.andP;  We have.andP;  Microsoft representatives, though, claimthat the press has been &quot;off base&quot; in its coverage.andP;  That's not to say thatMicrosoft is ignoring theandM;PC networking, because it isn't The company is indeed looking into E-mail forPC LAN technologies-but not necessarily just LAN Manager.andP;  Microsoft actuallypointed out its need to recognize NetWare's presence in the market before webroached the subject.andP;  In the end, all we know for sure is that a PC LANmessaging system is a direction for Microsoft.andP;  Whether or not the systemwill be an MS MAIL derivative, whether it will be based on LAN Manager orNetWare, or when it will be released, we don't know.andP;  We suspect, though,that Microsoft will be making some sort of announcement soon.andM;COMMENTS.andP;  When you see a demo of MS Mail interacting with Excel andHyperCard applications, you may start to look at MS Mail as anenvironment-the glue that binds together applications and users fromdifferent locations.andP;  While we wouldn't argue with you, we'd characterize itmore as an enabler.andP;  It can extend applications and make them more useful bygiving them communication.andP;  MS Mail has a lot of potential here, especiallyif ISVs continue to embrace it die way Microsoft hopes.andM;Yet, MS Mail could be more adaptable.andP;  One of Microsoft's goals with MS Mailwas to make it support multiple hardware platforms.andP;  It supports two clients:Macs and PCs.andP;  That seems reasonable, until you consider how Mac-centric theproduct is and how confined to AppleTalk networks.andP;  Microsoft is positioningMS Mail as an enterprise communication package.andP;  But that probably won't flyunless MS Mail moves quickly to PC LAN technologies and ensures complete,interoperable environments among all clients and servers on the network.andM;Aside from its Macintosh dependency, we consider MS Mail to be a generationahead of the E-mail you're probably using right now.andP;  Leveraging applicationswith electronic mail is quite a turning point, even if Microsoft isn't alonein this area.andP;  A few vendors are also positioning their MS Mail APIs toenable distributed applications (look at Banyan, for instance).andP;  Yet, we'reespecially encouraged by Microsoft's aggressive ISV campaign; the companyseems to be getting a good deal of attention from the Mac ISV sector.andP;  Andthe fact that users can make their own HyperCard applications network-awareis also promising.andP;  At the very least, MS Mail provides an example of thepotential of electronic mail in distributed computing environments.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
