For a cylindrical can of thickness dandless;andless;{delta} andradius Randless;andless;{lambda}, where {lambda} is the wavelength, it is shown thatthe critical thickness for effective screening is d/sub c/ = {delta}{sup2}/R. For a planar film with thickness dandless;andless;{delta}, d/sub c/ = c/2{pi}{sigma},where {sigma} is the conductivity. An exact analysis is also presentedof the screening for a cylinder of arbitrary thickness, as well as ananalogy between screening by normal metals and screening by superconductors.</TEXT></DOC>
