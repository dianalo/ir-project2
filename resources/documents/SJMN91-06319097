Are they for real? You could always findout against the Lakers and Magic Johnson.;   Life Without Magic comes to theColiseum Arena tonight, and the biggest test awaits the Lakers. Suddenly, theyare a mediocre team, playing in shock.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NEW RESPECT FOR WARRIORS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     And then there are the Warriors -- holding the NBA's best record (6-1) andgenerating the most entertaining of questions:;   Are they for real?;   Thereis nothing fluky about the Warriors' start. It is no quirk of scheduling,that's for sure. The Warriors have played five of their seven games on theroad, in such places as Chicago, Philadelphia and Milwaukee. Tough towns,tough teams. Tuesday, they played at home against Phoenix, a team that hasowned them for three years. The Warriors won 119-116.;   PHOENIX Coach CottonFitzsimmons was grudging in his respect, although he did concede that he likesthis Golden State team more than any of the previous three.;   Amore-intensive Warriors scouting report was advanced by Tom Chambers, theSuns' 10th-year forward. &quot;They're a lot more aggressive, a lot more physical.They've got a good front line. It's not all gimmicks anymore,&quot; he said.;  &quot;They're more solid. If their shots aren't going in, they can hang in now withtheir defense. . . . They don't have to be extremely hot (shooting) to winanymore. . . . I think, yeah, they are a team to be reckoned with.&quot;;   Therewas a telling sequence early in the Phoenix game, a startlingly unfamiliarscene for those who have followed the Warriors the last few seasons.;  Phoenix put up a shot that bounced high off the back of the rim. The Warriorscleared the rebound. The Warriors shot, and missed. The Warriors got therebound. The Warriors shot and missed again. The Warriors got another rebound.The Warriors, finally, scored.;   It was like that most of the night. It hasbeen like that most of the season. The Warriors have outrebounded the foe fivetimes in seven games. The Warriors' record in the battle of the boards thelast two seasons was 32-132.;   Billy Owens is the easy answer to what hasgotten into the Warriors, and that's mostly right.;   Owens has given theWarriors some inside scoring punch, some rebounding, some bulk and ultimatelyhe will give them some defense. Moreover, there is the ripple effect of Owens'presence. He has lengthened the Warriors' bench. A year ago, Tom Tolbert wasstarting games. Now, Tolbert is playing minutes and situations better suitedto his abilities.;   BESIDES OWENS, the Warriors are getting more than theyexpected from Vincent Askew, more than they could have expected from rookieVictor Alexander and about what they figured from Tyrone Hill. The differencein the Warriors is two rookies, a second-year player (Hill) and a guy (Askew)who will play his 35th NBA game tonight.;   Right now, those guys are playingwith free chips. The opposition doesn't know much about them. It's not unlikea rookie pitcher baffling veteran hitters, because there is no book on him.;  Soon, though, there will be a book on Owens and Alexander. Scouts will findtheir weaknesses and their tendencies, and teams will attempt to exploitthem.;   Owens and Alexander will need to adjust. They also will need to fightthrough the midseason rookie blues. After 40 games, these guys will befighting exhaustion -- and they'll be only halfway home.;   We weren't goingto learn everything about the Warriors tonight anyway, and now we'll learnless. They should beat the Magicless Lakers. And it won't be much fun.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bud Geracie column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911114  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  615  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 14, 199100319097,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
