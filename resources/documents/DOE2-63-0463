<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0463 </DOCNO><TEXT>As the result of reviewing the test series related to safety at EBR-2,it was revealed that the passive heat removal from EBR-2 during any shutdowncondition is effective, and the EBR-2 has the capability of inherentlysafe residual heat removal. Based on the observation and the data obtainedby these tests, the simulation code systems have been developed, andused widely for the design assessment of larger reactors. However, asa passive ultimate heat sink to discharge heat from a reactor, EBR-2is too small. Further, it became clear that the nuclear and thermal propertiesof metallic fuel play major part in realizing the advantageous reactivityfeedback characteristics for inherently safe shoutdown in the case ofloss of coolant type ATWS accidents. To acquire the inherently safe shutdowncapability for transient over power type of accidents will be the criticalpath to the complete inherent safety of metallic-fueled fast reactors.Taking core performance analyses to data into account, the reductionof control rod worth to compensate burnup reactivity depletion basedon the high breeding potential seems to be possible in the design ofthese reactors, and this may be the breakthrough. The advanced way ofreactor control by reactivity feedback characteristics without controlrods is feasible in these reactors. (Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
