The bankruptcy trustee, Martin R. Shugrue, met Friday afternoonwith U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney, according to a highly placedlaw enforcement source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Maloney did not return several calls and declined to comment onthe investigation earlier in the week.   But the source said Shugrue ``was just trying to convince him notto indict the airline.''   Shugrue reportedly fears any indictments against Eastern wouldscare away passengers and possibly torpedo his efforts to save theairline.   ``This is a meeting we've been trying to arrange for quite sometime and it's to present the facts in the case, said Robin Matell,an Eastern spokesman in Miami. ``I don't know the nature of thetalks.''   The Daily News reported Friday that the 10-month-old federalgrand jury investigation _ concerned with the airline's safety andmaintenance procedures at Kennedy and LaGuardia airports _ is nearlycomplete and that several indictments are expected.   The panel is looking into allegations that Eastern alteredmaintenance and safety records at the airports as well asquestionable practices at the Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, theairline's largest hub.   One former Eastern official at another airport said mechanicswere routinely certifying that they had tested for water in fueltanks when they had not done so. Large amounts of water in a fueltank could cause an engine to stall.   According to the News, federal investigators were looking intowhether top Eastern officials were aware that Eastern managers atKennedy and La Guardia allegedly ordered mechanics to disregardsafety guidelines and then falsified logbooks to show that properchecks were made.   Shugrue was appointed trustee to run Eastern as Frank Lorenzo'sreplacement as the airline tries to pull itself out bankruptcyproceedings. The Machinists union at Eastern has been on strikesince March 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
