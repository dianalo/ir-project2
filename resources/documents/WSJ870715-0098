SeibStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST LATAMMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)AEROSPACE (ARO)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan signaled that he is likely to ask Congress to give Nicaragua's Contra rebels more aid over a longer period of time than he previously sought -- an indication that he may be toughening his response to the Iran-Contra hearings.    On the same day Lt. Col. Oliver North repeated his plea for Contra aid at the congressional hearings, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration is considering asking Congress for more than the $105 million it already has requested in Contra aid for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The increase would be sought because the administration would like Congress to approve aid for an 18-month period, rather than for only a year, Mr. Fitzwater said.    Mr. Fitzwater didn't say exactly how much more aid the administration might seek. He said that a figure of $300 million, which some administration hard-liners have suggested, is &quot;pretty high.&quot; He suggested $130 million to $140 million might be &quot;more appropriate.&quot;    Administration officials said that Mr. Fitzwater made the announcement because the White House wants to indicate that it will fight for a longer American commitment to the Contras but that it won't seek as big an increase in the amount of aid as some reports have suggested. By indicating the size and duration of its likely request, the administration may be trying to test congressional reaction before President Reagan officially says how much aid he is seeking.    The announcement represents a partial victory for right-wing activists within the administration, who have been arguing in recent days that the favorable public response to Col. North's assertive testimony has created an opportunity for the administration to get more aid for the Contras.    Col. North, a former National Security Council staff member who spearheaded the White House effort to win private backing for the Contras during the period Congress prohibited government aid, has argued passionately for the Contra cause in his testimony. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted Sunday indicated he may have succeeded in generating more public support for the insurgents.    According to the poll, 40% of those questioned now approve of the administration's policy of aiding the Nicaraguan rebels, while 43% oppose it. In May, 32% of those questioned in a similar poll supported the policy, while 54% opposed it. The latest poll was a nationwide survey of 1,200 adults.    Mr. Fitzwater asserted that the White House was considering increasing its aid request for the Contras even before Col. North's testimony and the public response to it. But he agreed that the testimony has been &quot;helpful&quot; to the drive to get Contra aid.    If the administration convinces Congress to approve an 18-month aid package, it would guarantee American support for the Contras until the end of President Reagan's term in January 1989. That would please administration hard-liners, who have wanted a more vigorous campaign for the Contras in spite of the controversy generated by the congressional hearings.    But it isn't clear that even the increased public support for the Contras can be translated into more votes for aid. Despite the current rise in public support, most polls show that more Americans oppose aiding the Contras than favor aid. And the recent increase in support may fade after Col. North isn't on television supporting the policy.    The indication that the White House is preparing to increase its aid request for the Contras came amid other suggestions that President Reagan is preparing to become more aggressive in responding to charges of mismanagement that have emerged at the Iran-Contra hearings. Mr. Reagan, answering reporters at a photo session, said that he wouldn't comment on the hearings until they are over, but that reporters then &quot;won't be able to shut me up.&quot;    Mr. Reagan also asserted that &quot;the most decent thing this country can do is to continue to aid the freedom fighters,&quot; the term the president uses for the Contras. The president said he would &quot;stand on the roof and yell&quot; in an effort to win aid for the Contras. </TEXT></DOC>
