(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In an experiment that defies centuries ofcourtroom tradition, Dakota County District Court jurors have beenallowed to pose written questions of witnesses in a criminal trial.   ``It made me feel a part of what was going on,'' juror M. KathrynLease said. ``It was wonderful. If I had to do it over again, Iwould have asked more questions.''   Judge Gerald Kalina and lawyers on both sides also said they werepleased with the experiment in the case of a man accused of stealingfrom his employer, even though the jurors were unable to reach averdict and the trial ended with a hung jury. Prosecutors have notdecided whether to retry the case.   The experiment was part of a study being done by socialpsychologist Larry Heuer of Northwestern University in Evanston,Ill., and Steven Penrod, a psychologist and lawyer teaching at theUniversity of Minnesota Law School.   They said about 100 judges nationwide have agreed so far toparticipate.   Penrod, who has done extensive research on juries, was attractedto the issue of jury participation in the early 1980s when a judgein Madison, Wis., decided to allow jurors to ask questions.   Penrod and Heuer, then at the University of Wisconsin, didresearch that included 29 judges and 67 trials across Wisconsin.   They found none of the disadvantages that some lawyers and judgeshad predicted _ that the process would drag out trials or thatjurors would become involved to the point of taking sides. Instead,they found some evidence that jurors were more attentive and moreconfident of their verdicts.   In the Dakota County trial, M. Christine Misurek, an assistantDakota County attorney, and defense attorney Michael McDonald agreedto the experiment.   As each witness finished testifying in response to questions fromthe lawyers, Kalina asked the jurors if they had questions. If theydid, they passed their written questions to the judge. He and thelawyers discussed whether the questions were appropriate. If theywere, the judge read them to the witness.   The defendant, Allen Haram of Apple Valley, was charged withconspiring with his brother, George Potter, to steal from Haram'semployer, Brook's Superette in Lakeville.   According to testimony, Potter walked into the store Feb. 27wearing a mask. The clerk, Haram, gave him money from the safe. Twostore supervisors apprehended Potter as he was leaving. Potterallegedly told the supervisors that he and Haram had staged therobbery, and both men were charged.   The jurors asked six questions. Kalina decided two wereinappropriate but allowed the other four. Two of those involved thestore's alarm button, since there was some confusion over whetherHaram pushed it. The jurors asked about its position and whether itis tested periodically.   McDonald said not all defense attorneys would want the procedureused in every trial. In some cases, he said, the more informationthat comes into a trial, the likelier it is the defendant will beconvicted.   ``You want the jury to go into the jury room with a lot ofquestions because you want them to feel less comfortable in findinghim guilty. You want them to think the state had not met its burdenin proving him guilty,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
