The 6-foot-1, 205-pound officer has gotten by with nary ascratch until a militant, anti-abortion organization began wagingguerrilla warfare at women's clinics in Pittsburgh.   Now Chuderewicz is on disability leave for several weeks,recovering from surgery for a hernia he suffered during a Februaryprotest while trying to arrest the local leader of Operation Rescue.   ``It gets me a little bit ticked off,'' said Chuderewicz, 56,who hasn't suffered a job-related injury since 1966. ``At the firstprotest, I fell down and darn near rolled under a bus.''   He is one of six city officers on long-term disability and oneof 50 officers who have been injured since June, when OperationRescue added three of the city's women's clinics to itsanti-abortion protest targets around the country.   In less than a year, police Chief Ralph Pampena estimates morethan 1,330 abortion foes have been arrested, and the protests havecost the police department roughly $100,000, including $30,000 incompensation claims.   Officials have become so frustrated they're considering using aracketeering law against the protesters to recoup their costs.   In Pittsburgh, as elsewhere, the group has turned demonstrationsinto confrontations because protesters use whatever methodspossible _ including chaining themselves to doors _ to preventaccess to abortion clinics.   Such tactics have clouded the issue, critics say.   ``The tactics are becoming more important than the issueitself,'' said Pampena. ``The issue now is between the police andthe demonstrators. It's no longer focused on the issue ofabortion.''   But the Rev. Keith Tucci, the local leader of Operation Rescue,said the group's methods are necessary to save lives.   ``I genuinely feel bad that any police officer has been hurt.That bothers me and I wish I could undo it. But children are dying.That's the consequence,'' said Tucci, 32, of Penn Hills, whoresigned as pastor of his evangelical church to work full time forthe movement.   Tucci argued that police have ``drawn themselves into this crossfire'' by using excessive force with demonstrators. ``The treatmentis far rougher than needed.''   In a demonstration, protesters use passive resistance _ goinglimp and requiring police to carry them to paddy wagons _ in orderto delay their arrest and, in turn, delay possible abortions.   Most of the injured officers' ailments involve back and groinproblems caused by lifting dozens of protesters, Pampena said.   Hoping to save strain on his officers, the chief said he offereddemonstration leaders the option of having a person arrested every45 seconds, the time it would take to carry someone away; thosearrested would have to cooperate by walking.   ``That way they're still getting the same amount of time,nobody's being harassed, nobody's being accused of brutality,''Pampena said. ``But they refused. They said that's not in theirplan.''   Tucci argued that protesters originally asked police for such anagreement, but it was they who refused.   Now, he said, Operation Rescue members are not as conciliatorybecause many claim they've been victims of police brutality.   ``After people have been beaten up and molested, I don't knowwhat incentive they have to get up and walk away now,'' he said.   Once arrested, demonstrators often continue to use passiveresistance. On several occasions, they've tied up city courts forhours and days by refusing to give their names, calling themselves``Baby Does'' to identify with the children they say are beingmurdered by abortion.   Allegheny County Jail Warden Charles Kozakiewicz said thecounty's expenses following a March 11 demonstration totaled morethan $15,000 because the activists withheld their names for 33hours to protest assault charges lodged against one of theirmembers.   Due to overcrowding at the jail, 60 women were held overnight inthe jail's gymnasium and 62 men were kept in police holding cellsuntil an unused building at Mayview State Hospital could beprepared.   Kozakiewicz said the women continued to remain limp upon arrivalat the jail, forcing guards to hold their heads erect forphotographing and drag them up five flights of steps to thegymnasium.   ``The whole process was time-consuming,'' the warden said.``Some of the officers suffered injury. Some of these women _ howcan I say it? _ were large.''   Operation Rescue organizers claim the women were fondled andsexually harassed by jail guards and strip-searched by male guards.   Kozakiewicz said he is troubled by those charges, saying thewomen were treated with dignity and respect. He said femalecorrections officers strip-searched only a few women, and the onlytime male officers became involved was when women had to be draggedupstairs to the gym.   ``It's devastating because you put your best foot forward,'' hesaid. ``Lord knows, they may have a champion in me in their cause.But it's certainly frustrating to me to have to carry and dragpeople in the jail. The point is not to be proved here.''   Pampena said he has issued memos to police officers instructingthem to be as gentle as possible in dealing with protesters.   ``We know we're not dealing with the criminal element and I haveno animosity toward them or their cause,'' he said. ``My policeofficers are probably split 50-50 on the issue.''   Officials at the abortion clinics say they are pleased with thejob police have done.   Meanwhile, attorneys representing the building that houses theAllegheny Reproductive Health Center have sued Operation Rescue,Tucci and more than 40 other people, claiming they have harmed thebuilding's reputation among its 28 tenants and discouragedpotential tenants.   The suit says the protesters violated the federal RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act because their blockades``constitute extortion and the interference with commerce bythreats or violence.''   The county law department is investigating whether Pittsburghcan apply the RICO act to recoup its costs of overtime, medicaltreatment for police and housing prisoners arrested indemonstrations.   But Operation Rescue spokesman Nick Brough said neither lawsuitsnor restraining orders will stop the protests.   ``They want us to run away in fear, but we cannot,'' Broughsaid. ``We have made a promise to God that we won't be deterred,whether by police brutality, tyrannical judges or unjust laws.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, April 12</NOTE></DOC>
