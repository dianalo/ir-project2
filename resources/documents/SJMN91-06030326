The twins, wholove to cook, are driving their dad, Kenji, crazy arguing over whom he willchoose to help him in the kitchen.  In San Francisco, mom, Eileen, aninsurance executive, has just left work and is boarding BART to be home intime for supper at 7.;    Since he gets home from work before his wife, Kenjihas made the kitchen his dinnertime domain. &quot;It is ironic,&quot; said theFremont-based graphic artist and printer. &quot;When I was growing up in Japan, mymom threw me out of the kitchen if I walked in at dinnertime. She said it washer only private place in the house. The kitchen was her castle.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Weekly, Part 2  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GRAPHIC ARTIST MAKES KITCHEN HIS DOMAINFREMONT LEARNED COOKING AS SURVIVAL SKILLIN SCHOOL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Weekly Cook  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Men didn't cook in Japan when I was growing up,&quot; he explained. &quot;The motherdid all the cooking and served the men first before she ate.&quot;;    When Juancame to the United States in 1970 to complete his degree at San FranciscoState, he surprised himself in many ways. &quot;I intended to go to business schooland ended up in art,&quot; he said. &quot;I also discovered that I had to learn how tocook or I didn't eat. I was an only child and had never cooked anything.&quot;;   Fortunately, he shared a campus apartment with classmates who knew their wayaround the kitchen. &quot;Several of my roommates were Chinese and were sons ofrestaurant owners,&quot; he said. &quot;They knew how to cook and used to invite me toeat dinner with them. I appreciated eating their good food because I wasstarving, and learned a lot about cooking by watching them.&quot;;    Spurred on byhunger and necessity, he began to perfect his newfound talent. &quot;I learned toimprovise in the kitchen through observation and through the memory of mymother's cooking. If there was a restaurant counter where I could watchsomeone cooking, I would sit and absorb what they were doing. Sometimes I readcookbooks and tried to re-create what I saw in pictures. Mostly, I took achance by creating my own recipes for familiar foods.&quot;;    He likes to cook&quot;pseudo-Oriental food.&quot; &quot;That means it's part Japanese-style cooking and partChinese-style with a dash of Korean mixed in,&quot; Juan said. &quot;The advantage tocooking Oriental-style is its main staple, rice. When you are in a hurry toget a meal on the table, cooked rice solves half of your problem. Add a meator fish dish mixed with a vegetable and you have a nutritious meal.&quot;;    Hefeels it's important for everyone to know how to cook, so he encourages hischildren to help him in the kitchen. &quot;They might help me wash the rice beforeit is cooked, or assist me to stuff homemade won tons. I involve them inanything safe to get them familiarized with the kitchen.&quot;;    When Oriental isnot on the menu, Juan cooks American. On Saturday, Juan will be putting histalents to work at the annual Calison Day Home Crab Feed at Saint Joseph'sChurch. Working in the kitchen, he will assist a team of volunteers inpreparing spaghetti, mixed green salad, and garlic bread to accompanymountains of fresh cracked crab.
