Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> SCH </CO><IN> SCR </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Charles Schwab Corp. said it will take an unexpectedly large $2.4 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter, to cover refunds to customers of money it received through unauthorized use of their securities.    The nation's largest discount securities broker has since last month been investigating trading procedures on transactions dating back to January 1985. The current period's charge covers establishment of a $4 million reserve for repayment to customers -- with interest -- of $3.5 million in gains Schwab took that &quot;may not have been appropriate.&quot;    In a prepared statement, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Schwab said, &quot;We're taking responsibility for what happened, for fixing it, and for making sure that it doesn't happen again.&quot; He added that &quot;company policy was violated&quot; and promised to &quot;take disciplinary action if appropriate.&quot; A spokesman said that it was &quot;premature&quot; to discuss whether Schwab employees will be disciplined, or whether any had violated securities laws.    The reserve announced yesterday is bigger than the &quot;worst-case&quot; $1 million to $2 million Mr. Schwab had earlier predicted the investigation would uncover. The spokesman said the number grew as the company's internal investigation has proceeded. He added that the company, having reviewed &quot;substantially all&quot; of the customer accounts in question, is &quot;highly confident&quot; the current charge will be sufficient to cover all the refunds.    The charge seems likely to wipe out most, if not all, of the company's fourth-quarter earnings. In this year's third quarter Schwab, which has seen trading activity plummet in the wake of the market's year-ago collapse, had net income of $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $98 million.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Schwab closed at $6.75, off 37.5 cents.    The repayment relates to trades made by Schwab employees when customers' holdings were subject to partial tender offers, or conversions of preferred stock, debt or warrants to common stock. When customers in such often-complex transactions told Schwab to carry out trades that didn't maximize their return, the company in some cases chose an alternative execution that provided higher profits. That extra profit flowed to the brokerage concern.    Mr. Schwab has earlier said that, while some of the practices clearly violated company policy, others were less clear-cut. In all the cases, shareholders received the sum that would have accrued to them had their own investment decision been carried out.    Schwab also disclosed that it is &quot;cooperating with the New York Stock Exchange in its examination of the matter.&quot; A company spokesman said the SEC isn't conducting an inquiry at this time. &quot;This is a very technical area,&quot; he said, adding that some of the trades were in a &quot;murky&quot; regulatory area where &quot;the people involved in this thought they could benefit the firm, without hurting customers.&quot;    In an unusually frank corporate mea culpa, Mr. Schwab said yesterday that &quot;some of our people lost sight of our main commitment -- our relationship with our customers.&quot; The company's audit team is continuing its work, he said, adding, &quot;We won't rest until we know the right answers and have addressed all regulatory concerns and taken strong measures to ensure that these problems cannot recur.&quot;    Although the Schwab trades didn't come to light until a late October story appeared in Business Week, Schwab has said its investigation began Oct. 6. An earlier Business Week article included allegations of similar trades made by the Pershing clearinghouse unit of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. In that case, Pershing was said to have tendered uncommitted shares of customers, and to have kept any unclaimed funds.    A source close to Pershing has said the funds were put in a reserve account, and didn't flow to Donaldson Lufkin's bottom line. Donaldson Lufkin has said the Business Week story &quot;grossly distorts Pershing's procedures,&quot; which &quot;weren't designed to profit the firm or any individual employee.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
