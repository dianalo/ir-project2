Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.    Wang, a computer maker, said it had been exploring ways to make the plant and the 181 acres of land it owns at and around the site available for economic development, when Monarch, a Springfield, Mass., insurance company, approached it. Donald Binns, president of Monarch's Signature Development Corp. subsidiary said that Monarch may turn the site into a development-park office complex. &quot;An independent business may be formed using the local plant manager and labor force that exists there now,&quot; he said.    Currently, Wang employs 95 full-time workers, 30 temporary salespeople and 25 other temporary workers at the plant. </TEXT></DOC>
