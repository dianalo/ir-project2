Texas Instruments said the new Micro Explorer would have all thefunctions of a standard Macintosh II as well asartificial-intelligence features, such as the ability to manipulatesymbols instead of just numbers.   Most other artificial-intelligence (AI) workstations, includingTexas Instruments' own Explorer, cannot be used as general-purposecomputers.   Other AI companies are also moving to insert their technologyinto existing computers, including Texas Instruments' biggest rivalin the field, Symbolics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.   However, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple said it will have anespecially close relationship with Dallas-based Texas Instruments.In a first for both companies, Texas Instruments and Apple willboth put their logos on the Micro Explorer, which will be marketedonly by Texas Instruments.   Texas Instruments and Apple said the Micro Explorer could beused in such varied fields as tax advising, computer-aided designand assigning gates to airplanes at airports.   Although artificial intelligence encompasses the whole conceptof making computers think like people, most products on the markethave the more modest goal of augmenting human decision makers byconverting knowledge into a set of rules that can be applied by acomputer.   The price of the Micro Explorer ranges from about $15,000 to$30,000, compared to $50,000 to $70,000 for the Explorer, which isabout twice as powerful, Texas Instruments said. An AI package willalso be available for people who already own the Mac II. Shipmentsare scheduled to begin in the April-June period.   Symbolics, in a response to the Texas Instruments announcement,said its Ivory chip for artificial intelligence is superior toTexas Instruments' Explorer Lisp chip. It also said its chip willbe plugged into not only the Mac II, but also InternationalBusiness Machines Corp.'s Personal System-2 and PC AT, although itcould not give a timetable.   Texas Instruments said it had no timetable for putting itsartificial-intelligence chip into other personal computers besidesthe Mac II.</TEXT></DOC>
