The G(-H/sub 2/)-valueof H/sup 2/O/sub 2/-mixtures (H/sub 2/:O/sub 2/ =1:9-2:1) ranges from1 to 14 with only slight dependence on pressure, temperature, H/sub 2//O/sub2/-ratio, and surface/volume ratio (S/V). The temperature has littleinfluence (35-210/sup 0/C). Replacing most of the O/sub 2/ in the H/sub2/:O/sub 2/ (1:9)-mixtures with N/sub 2/, Ar or excess H/sub 2/ at highertemperature, causes the G(-H/sub 2/)-values to increase. The influenceof these matrix gases increases with increasing temperature (35-210/sup0/C) and decreasing S/V ratio (0.59 and 3.8 cm/sup -1/ of the reactionvessel; it depends also on the pretreatment of the wall surface. Varyingthe total pressure, the G(-H/sub 2/)-values show a temperature and gasmixture dependent maximum between about 20 and 200 mb. At higher temperature(210/sup 0/C) we observed an influence of dose for 50 mb H/sub 2//air-mixtures,whereas at 1 b and 35-90/sup 0/C no influence of the dose on the rateof reaction of such mixtures was found. The activation by N/sub 2/, Ar,H/sub 2/ is discussed on the base of the H/sub 2//O/sub 2/-reaction beinga radical-chain reaction, built up by a least 38 coupled elementary steps.O/sub 2/ reacts with H/sub 2/, at increased rates of conversion (andgt;25%),in the expected stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. Oxygen may however alsobe converted in non-stoichiometric amounts under certain conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
