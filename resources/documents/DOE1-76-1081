<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-1081 </DOCNO><TEXT>A technique for determination of the liquid volumes of solutions in holdingtanks and for their fissile material content has been developed and tested.It is independent of the size of the tank, the fraction of full capacityoccupied, and void volumes caused, for example, by build up of soliddeposits or gas bubbles. Because the amount of spike added to the tankis accurately known, the inventory is also independent of solution volumeand density. It involves use of isotope dilution mass spectrometry throughapplication of a double spiking technique using lutetium. A known amountof natural lutetium is added to the subject tank. After thorough mixing,an aliquot of solution is withdrawn from the tank. A known amount oflutetium enriched in the 176 isotope is added to the aliquot. Mass spectrometricanalysis and the technique of isotope dilution allow determination ofthe volume of liquid in the tank. The same aliquot used for volume determinationcan be used for assay of uraniuim and plutonium for both isotopic compositionand concentration. This allows determination of total fissile weightcontained in a given tank. 6 refs., 2 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
