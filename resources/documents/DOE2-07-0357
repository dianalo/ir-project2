Three groups of computer-naive subjects participated in fiveself-paced learning sessions; in each sessions, subjects solved a seriesof programming problems with immediate feedback. Twenty-four subjectslearned to solve BASIC programming problems (BASIC group) for all fivesessions, 23 subjects learned to solve corresponding Natural Languageprogramming problems for all five sessions (Natural Language group),and 23 subjects learned to solve Natural Language programming problemsfor three sessions and then transferred to BASIC for the two sessions(Transfer group). At the end of the fifth session, all subjects completeda post-test which required the subjects to use their programming knowledgein a new way. Results indicated that the Natural Language trained subjectshad complete transfer to BASIC, as indicated by no overall differencein comprehension time or accuracy for final BASIC sessions (i.e., sessionsfour and five) for the Transfer and BASIC groups. In addition, therewas an interaction between group and session on accuracy, in which theTransfer group increased its accuracy at a faster rate than the BASICgroup.</TEXT></DOC>
