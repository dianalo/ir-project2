Cyclotron radiation in cosmic plasma from the Sun activeregions is considered as well as radio-frequency radiation of magneticAp stars. Cyclotron absorption bands in optical spectra of magnetic whitedwarfs and cyclotron lines in X-ray pulsars and gamma bursters spectraare considered as well.</TEXT></DOC>
