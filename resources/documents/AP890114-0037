The newspaper Al-Nadwa quoted Subroto as saying in an interviewthat cooperation from non-OPEC oil producers along with dwindlingstockpiles as demand rises, partly because of winter, alsocontributed to the increase.   ``Solidarity of OPEC member states after the last OPEC conferenceis the most important reason (for the hike), but this strengthhinges primarily on the extent of adherence to the terms of the lastagreement,'' Subroto was quoted as saying.   Middle East oil prices have risen more than $3 a barrel from arange of $11-$15 a barrel since the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries introduced a Jan. 1 production quota of 18.5million barrels a day.   Because of a glut on the world market, oil prices plunged as lowas $10 a barrel in price swings over the past two years that rarelyreached OPEC's target of an $18 benchmark price.   Subroto told Al-Nadwa the price fluctuations were caused forreasons ``within and outside'' OPEC, in a reference toover-production by some cartel members in defiance of the quotasystem.   ``It is when OPEC is hit by weakness and confusion that thestockpiles are used (to aggravate the glut) and this affects theprice, but that rises the minute solidarity returns,'' he was quotedas saying.   Subroto admitted it was hard for OPEC to determine the quantitiesstockpiled in order to balance the market with its output, but saidall member nations were hopeful the $18 a barrel benchmark wouldprevail.   Subroto left the Sultanate of Oman today after holding talks withOil Minister Saeed Al-Shanfari in advance of a Jan. 26 meeting inLondon, where OPEC and non-OPEC producers will try to coordinatepolicy on stabilizing prices.   Subroto earlier had visited Egypt, which along with Oman is anon-OPEC producer that cooperates with the cartel.</TEXT></DOC>
