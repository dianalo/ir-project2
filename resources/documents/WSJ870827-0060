In California, garment makers import labor from the Philippines. Along the Northeastern corridor, from Boston to Washington, D.C., hotels, restaurants, department stores and supermarkets complain of a dearth of workers. One motorist drove into an Exxon station on New Jersey's busy Route 22 at midday not long ago only to find the place closed and plastered with &quot;Help Wanted&quot; signs.    In other words, the U.S. has a labor shortage, something it hasn't experienced in at least two decades. It results from several convergent trends: nearly five years of steady economic growth; the arrival of a &quot;baby-bust&quot; generation with fewer work-force entrants; a chronic problem with &quot;unemployables&quot;; and effects of the coercive immigration act Congress and the administration, in their combined wisdom, inflicted on the country last year.    If the shortage continues to spread, it could have economic consequences, raising the potential for inflation and reducing the potential for further economic growth, which has generated a phenomenal 12 million jobs over the past four years.    The nation's current 6% unemployment rate, while down sharply from the 10%-plus peaks of the 1982-83 recession, still sounds high by historical measures. But given geographical disparities in job availability, the economic cushions available to nonworkers and &quot;unemployables,&quot; some economists think the U.S. is about as close as it can get to &quot;full employment&quot; today.    While demand for labor has increased, the supply has not expanded accordingly. The supply of 16-to-24 year olds (the baby-bust generation) has diminished as a result of the declining birthrate in the early 1970s. That age cohort made up nearly a quarter of the work force in 1980, but now makes up only a fifth. Within 10 years, its share will decrease even more.    Yet another sad truth is that a certain segment of the population is chronically unemployed. We are referring to the inner city poor, most of whom are black or Hispanic. The problem is complex. Efforts to bring jobs to the inner cities have had only limited success and youths in those places aren't motivated to leave. Some who seem to be jobless are in fact employed, in petty and not-so-petty crime, a fact that itself discourages employers from moving in. Many of the chronically unemployed are simply unemployable; they are often illiterate, sometimes have anti-social pathologies (such as drug abuse) or, at the very least, lack the interpersonal skills and deportment necessary to secure and maintain even a low-skill entry-level job.    No matter how low the unemployment rate drops, or how many jobs are created, the unemployable will remain outside the work force. Much of this can be blamed on two and a half decades of well-meaning but misguided social policies that damaged inner city schools, fostered dependency among the poor and subsidized unproductivity.    Congress could hardly have picked a worse time than last year to pass the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which requires employers to screen job applicants' legal residence or face penalties. In its haste to deal with a &quot;problem&quot; that consisted of nothing more than poor people trying to earn a living, Congress has managed to diminish a source of temporary labor. The idea that these jobs now will be filled by welfare recipients makes sense if Congress now can invent some way to ship the folks on welfare in New York to Oregon's strawberry fields.    Right now, labor shortages are confined to certain regions of the country, mainly in some 30 major metropolitan areas, where unemployment is at 4% or lower. But the converging trends we cited have not nearly peaked yet: The baby bust will not bottom out until 1995, the explosive labor demand will continue with potential for some nine million new jobs over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the problem of the unemployables shows no sign of abating.    Congress has the power to ease the pinch. It can modify the immigration act, for example, to allow more imported labor. It can expedite welfare reform with a view toward creating greater incentives for work. It can reexamine unemployment compensation laws to reduce the incentives for idleness. Most of all, it can recognize, however belatedly, that it is faced not with recession but the consequences of something that should be welcomed and sustained, national economic growth. </TEXT></DOC>
