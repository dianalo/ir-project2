(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s offer to buyGreat Northern Nekoosa Corp. for $3.13 billion may attract bidsfrom other corporations interested in acquiring the paper productscompany, analysts say.   Great Northern's stock surged $20.12{ a share to close at$62.87{ Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, a jump of nearly 50percent that exceeded Georgia-Pacific's offering price of $58 ashare. That indicates investors believe a higher offer may emerge.   Georgia-Pacific's stock dropped $2.50 a share to close at$50.87{.   Analysts said bids may come from such forest and paper productscompanies as Jefferson Smurfit Corp., Champion International Co.,International Paper Corp., Weyerhaeuser Co. and Abitibi-Price Inc.   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, also could pursue a mergerwith Champion or Boise Cascade Corp., said Mark Kurland, an analystwith Nabon Nugent andamp; Co. in New York.   Industry spokesmen said the offer was the first unsolicitedtakeover bid in the U.S. paper industry, and confirmed marketrumors of the past few days that Georgia-Pacific would try to takeover Great Northern, which makes paper products, lumber and plywood.   The company, which has 3.5 million acres of timberland and20,000 employees, reported sales of $3.6 billion last year.   Georgia-Pacific, which is based in Atlanta, had $9.5 billion insales, making paper, other forest products and building materials.It owns 6.5 million acres of timberland and 380 plants and millsemploying 44,000 workers.   Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig said in a statementthat Georgia-Pacific's offer was uninvited but would be considered``in due course'' by the company's board of directors. Companyofficials declined further comment.   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. stressed the offerwas a friendly one that he and Laidig discussed Monday night on thetelephone.   ``I indicated that all terms are negotiable,'' he said Tuesdayin New York. ``Bill is a personal friend. I hold him and themanagement of Great Northern in the highest regard.''   Nevertheless, Georgia-Pacific filed a complaint Tuesday in U.S.District Court in Portland, Maine, challenging that state'syear-old anti-takeover statute. The law requires a hostile raiderto wait five years before completing a merger unless the deal winsprior approval from directors of the target company.   Great Northern is incorporated in Maine and is the state'slargest landowner. In a related suit, Georgia-Pacific asked thecourt to throw out several anti-takeover provisions in GreatNorthern's by-laws.   A top Georgia-Pacific executive on Tuesday briefed Maine Gov.John R. McKernan and other top state officials in Augusta about thebuyout proposal.   ``What we are stressing to the leaders of the state is that thisis a cash offer by an operating company. This is not an LBO(leveraged buyout). We are not breakup artists,'' said A.D.``Pete'' Correll, executive vice president in charge of pulp andpaper.   Hahn said the merged company would be more competitive globallyand would offer more job stability to Georgia-Pacific and GreatNorthern employees.   ``This is not like so many transactions you see today. We'reoperators, not liquidators. We see this as an opportunity time,''he said.   Under the tender offer, Georgia-Pacific would buy about 54million outstanding common shares for $58 a share, a deal thatvalues the company at $3.13 billion. The acquisition would total$4.5 billion including refinancing costs, fees and expenses.   Georgia-Pacific said its bid represented a 50 percent premiumover the market price of Great Northern before takeover speculationdrove up the stock's price starting Thursday.   The company said the deal was conditioned on, among otherthings, acquiring at least 75 percent of Great Northern'soutstanding shares by Nov. 29 and the dismantling by Great Northernof some of its takeover defenses.   The bid comes at the end of a period of strong expansion in thepaper industry that was sparked by the decline of the dollar andhealthy economic growth.   Lately, paper industry profits have slumped as the dollar hasrebounded, making imports cheaper and exports more expensive, andeconomic growth has slowed.</TEXT></DOC>
