Botha, at oddswith his own party, returns from an eight-week convalescenceWednesday to confront his Cabinet ministers after they joined incalling for a new head of state.   By late Tuesday, Botha has made no public response to theannouncement by the National Party parliamentary caucus _ includingthe entire Cabinet _ that it wanted Education Minister Frederik deKlerk to become president.   Botha, 73, resigned as party leader Feb. 2, two weeks aftersuffering a stroke, and was succeeded in the post by de Klerk.   The caucus has no formal means of forcing Botha out of thepresidency, barring evidence of misconduct or incapacity. But itsannouncement Monday night that it wanted the party leader to be headof state was viewed as a blunt message that Botha should drop plansto stay in office until next year.   The Star, the country's largest daily newspaper, referred to ``anominous silence'' at the presidential office in Cape Town andpredicted Botha would ``come out fighting after being cut adrift''by his party.   The power struggle between de Klerk and Botha reached a turningpoint Sunday, when Botha arranged an interview with state TV andannounced he would not call an early election this year.   The next election does not have to be held until March 1990, andBotha's declaration _ made without consulting party leaders _quashed hopes he would retire in the next few months in conjunctionwith an early election.   Beeld, an Afrikaans-language Johannesburg newspaper loyal to theNational Party, said in a biting editorial Tuesday: ``There is anunavoidable impression that the election is being delayed as long aspossible to extend the term of the state president as long aspossible.''   De Klerk indicated Botha should decide for himself whether toretire, telling reporters: ``There is nothing in the (caucus)decision that says he must step down now.''   The Argus, Cape Town's afternoon paper, said in an editorial thatBotha had two options:   ``He could take the undisguised hint and step down,'' thenewspaper said, or ``he could tough it out and cling to his job, ashe is constitutionally entitled to do. But he would be presidingover a grudging caucus and Cabinet, and the results of that forSouth Africa could be disastrous.''   Botha's spokesman, Jack Viviers, said the president was expectedto report for work at 8 a.m. Wednesday. He is to preside over aCabinet meeting, then go to Parliament for presentation of the newbudget.   Botha and his wife, Elize, were to have Cabinet members and otherguests at their home Tuesday night to celebrate their 46th weddinganniversary.   Throughout the National Party's 40 years in power, the head ofgovernment had always been party leader. After Botha quit the partypost, party members suddenly felt free to express simmeringopposition to his authoritarian style of leadership, and to the pacehe set for racial reform.   During 10 years as head of government, Botha has moved cautiouslyto remove or amend aspects of apartheid, the system ofrace-segregation that gives the white minority economic andpolitical control over the black majority. But Botha has held to theunderlying apartheid concept of separate racial groups, and has usedemergency powers to quell anti-apartheid uprisings in blackcommunities.   De Klerk, 52, is widely seen as more open-minded and flexiblethan Botha, and more in tune with a younger generation of whites whofavor early and far-reaching solutions to South Africa's socialproblems.   ``A new man ... would be forced to do new things,'' said TheSowetan, the country's largest black daily newspaper, urging Bothato retire.</TEXT></DOC>
