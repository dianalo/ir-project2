The newly declassified three-page stipulation summarizing theintelligence was released in censored form under an agreementreached between the Justice Department and The Associated Pressalong with nine other news organizations.   ``The intelligence ... provides information regarding thepricing and delivery of missiles and military material sold to Iranand the release of American hostages held in Lebanon,'' says thestipulation.   Still-classified reports on the intelligence were gathered by``various methods of surveillance'' and ``show individualsinvolved, including General Secord,'' the stipulation adds. ``Thereports contained information about pricing of this material andthose recipients of the reports at the Central Intelligence Agency,National Security Council, and Department of Defense who knew theactual cost of this material to the DOD could have known theIranians were being significantly overcharged.''   North enlisted Secord to run arms to the Contras and also hadthe former Air Force major general turned businessman assist armsshipments to Iran for the Reagan administration.   North and Secord diverted profits from the Iran arms sales intobank accounts controlled by Secord and some of the diverted moneywas funneled to the Contras for their fight to oust the Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua.   The intelligence reports on which the stipulation is based``generally range from two to several pages and are inchronological order commencing on September 1985 and ending inDecember 1986,'' the newly released document says.   The intelligence reports were sent to 17 people, the stipulationsays, including Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, CIAdirector William Casey and national security advisers RobertMcFarlane and John Poindexter.   The news organizations went to court April 21 seeking disclosureof the stipulation, which was given to the North jury duringdeliberations, but not released to the public.   The stipulation underscores testimony at North's trial that topadministration officials were given information about the prices ofweapons being sold to Iran. Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl testifiedthat in computing a mark-up on one proposed shipment in the springof 1986, he multiplied the cost of military spare parts by a factorof 3.7. Earl was an aide to North on the National Security Council.   The National Security Agency had insisted that the uncensoredversion of the stipulation submitted to the North jury be kept outof the public record. The highly secretive agency gathersintelligence through a worldwide communications network.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rejected the news media'smotion to release the stipulation, saying the document wasclassified. Today, Gesell signed an order authorizing the JusticeDepartment to release the censored version.   The sanitized version of the stipulation ``deletes solelyinformation that would disclose methods of intelligencecollection,'' according to a joint court filing by lawyers for thenews organizations and the Justice Department. The deletedinformation also includes data ``as to the precise time at whichinformation was received.''   ``It does not delete the names or titles of any governmentofficials who received the information and whose names already havebeen released in the public record,'' said the court filing.   North's lawyers referred to the stipulation in closing argumentsat his trial to show that Casey and Poindexter knew that Hawkmissiles were aboard a November 1985 shipment from Israel to Iranassisted by the CIA. North was found guilty Thursday of aiding andabetting the preparation of a false chronology for Congress statingthat no one in the government knew until January 1986 that Hawkmissiles were aboard the November 1985 shipment. The convictionalso covers shredding of documents in connection with thechronology. North's defense on the charge was that Casey andPoindexter knew at the time what was in the shipment, but arrangedto cover up that fact from Congress.

Inc.; National Public Radio; The New YorkTimes Co.; the Times Mirror Co.; and The Washington Post.</TEXT></DOC>
