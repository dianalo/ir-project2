Sandi Polaski, chief negotiator for the Washington-BaltimoreNewspaper Guild Local 31, said the guild's bargaining committee wasrecommending approval by the 1,420 newsroom and other white collaremployees covered by the pact.   ``It's not everything we wanted,'' Polaski said, but it contains``substantial improvements'' in wages and guild representation.   The tentative agreement was reached Friday following all-nighttalks. The previous contract expired three years ago and Postmanagement had declared an impasse two years ago. Post reportersresorted to two byline strikes on the anniversaries of the expiredpact.   In addition to newsroom workers, the contract covers employeesin the accounting, advertising, circulation and data-processing andother business departments of the Post's 3,000-member workforce.   The new contract would raise salaries between 4 percent and 6percent a year, with lower-paid workers receiving a higherpercentage increase along with improvements in minimum salaryscales.   Employees who make more than $50,000 a year, which includes mostof the paper's reporters, will get average raises of $42.50 a weekduring each of the first three years of the contract, with similarraises expected in the final two years.   The pact also calls for improvements in the Post's pension anddisability-insurance plans, and better medical and dental coverage,but at higher cost to employees.   The additional salary and pension provisions will cost thecompany about $15 million over the life of the contract, accordingto Frank Havlicek, the newspaper's chief negotiator.   The agreement also contains provisions for resolvingworker-management disputes and a no-strike, no-lockout clause.</TEXT></DOC>
