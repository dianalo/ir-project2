Products of inositol lipid turnover, suchas inositol trisphosphate (IP/sub 3/) and phosphatidic acid appear tomediate Ca/sup 2+/ levels by increasing the permeability of internalmembranes and the plasma membrane to Ca/sup 2+/. Hyperthermia increasesboth internal levels of Ca/sup 2+/ and Ca/sup 2+/ influx. Increase inintracellular free Ca/sup 2+/ concentration are immediately precededby an increase in IP/sub 3/. Agents which mimic effects of heat suchas arsenite and alcohols cause a similar, rapid increase in IP/sub 3/levels. Heating also causes a major increase in Ca/sup 2+/ flux acrossthe plasma membrane and this increased flux is closely correlated withmembrane accumulation of phosphatidic acid. Hyperthermia thus causesa major perturbation in inositol lipid metabolism and these changes areintimately correlated with heat-induced alterations in cell Ca/sup 2+/fluxes and levels. Heat-induced inositol lipid turnover may thus playa causal role in the increases in intracellular Ca/sup 2+/ observed inheated cells.</TEXT></DOC>
