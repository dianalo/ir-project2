Responding to press reports of alleged overproduction by theUnited Arab Emirates, Ginandjar Kartasasmita said OPEC has notconfirmed that the UAE is violating its quota even though he saidthe reports should be taken seriously.   ``Some members may have a reason for overproducing and (cutbacks)may have to be done gradually. This is permitted by OPEC. What isnot permitted is to put this (overproduction) on the market,''Kartasasmita told reporters.   He said a meeting of an eight-member subcommittee of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries charged withmonitoring compliance with the new quota system would be obligatoryif overproduction occurred, but he indicated a meeting would not beheld before February.   ``We are barely two weeks into the accord and we cannot know whatproduction will be for January,'' he said.   OPEC agreed last November to limit production to 18.5 millionbarrels a day starting Jan. 1.   A scheduled meeting of the subcommittee, to which Venezuela andIndonesia both belong, is set for March.   Kartasasmita said OPEC will seek cutbacks from a group ofindependent producers in a joint meeting Jan. 26 that need notamount to the 15 to 20 percent reduction OPEC is imposing on itsmembers.   ``We don't ask for that much. It's up to them to decide how muchthey want to cut. We are not demanding anything, but any cut willhelp,'' the minister said.   He said that OPEC would not be able to reach its price aim of $18per barrel without total member compliance and without cooperationfrom non-OPEC producers.   He said Indonesia is estimating its average price this year at$14 a barrel as part of a government policy to wean the islandnation from its dependence on oil income.   Kartasasmita arrived in Caracas Monday for a five-day officialvisit which has included talks with Venezuelan Energy Minister JulioCesar Gil and Venezuelan president-elect Carlos Andres Perez.   He said Indonesia supports Perez' proposal for a summit of OPECheads of state in 1990, the year of OPEC's 30th anniversary.   The two countries are exploring technical cooperation in oilbetween the Indonesian state oil company Pertamina and Petroleos deVenezuela S.A. and increasing bilateral trade in non-oil goods.   Kartasasmita plans to visit OPEC member Ecuador and independentproducers Colombia and Mexico following his scheduled Fridaydeparture from Venezuela.   Perez, who will be inaugurated Feb. 2, is scheduled to visitIran, Iraq and United Arab Emirates next week to drum up support foran OPEC summit.   </TEXT></DOC>
