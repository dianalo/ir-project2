Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this final rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 50 handlers of Washington potatoes under this marketingorder, and approximately 490 Washington potato producers. Small agriculturalproducers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR121.2) as those having annual gross revenues for the last three years ofless than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined asthose whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majorityof the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. The marketing order requires that the assessment rate for a particularfiscal year apply to all assessable potatoes handled from the beginningof such year. An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the committeeand submitted to the Department of Agriculture for approval. The membersof the committe are handlers and producers of potatoes. They are familiarwith the committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services and personnelin their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriatebudget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate andprovide input. The assessment rate recommended by the committee is derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of potatoes. Because that rateis applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate whichwill produce sufficient income to pay the committee's expected expenses.A recommended budget and rate of assessment is usually acted upon by thecommittee before the season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuousbasis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approval must be expeditedso that the committee will have funds to pay its expenses. The State of Washington Potato Committee met on February 17, 1989, andunanimously recommended a budget for the 1989-90 fiscal period of $35,000and an assessment rate of $.004 per hundredweight of potatoes. The budgetis $2,000 more than last year's reflecting increases of $1,000 for salaries,$100 for the committee's financial audit, and $900 for compliance audits.All other budget categories remain the same. The 1989-90 recommended assessment rate of $.004 per hundredweight of potatoesis the same as the rate of the previous fiscal period. This rate, whenapplied to anticipated fresh market shipments of seven million hundredweight,will yield $28,000 in assessment revenue. This, along with $7,000 fromthe reserve, would be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Reserves areexpected to amount to $10,000 at the end of the 1989-90 fiscal period andwill be carried over into the next fiscal period. This reserve amount iswithin the maximum authorized under the order of one fiscal year's expenses.While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costsare in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additionalcosts may be passed onto producers. However, these costs will be significantlyoffset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order.Therefore, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 10156, March 10, 1989). That documentcontained a proposal to add andSection; 946.242 to establish expenses andan assessment rate for the State of Washington Potato Committee. That ruleprovided that interested persons could file comments through March 20,1989. No comments were received. It is found that the specified expenses are reasonable and likely to beincurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to coversuch expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 946 </ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, potatoes (Washington).
