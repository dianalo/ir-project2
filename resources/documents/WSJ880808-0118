Jack Kemp told members of the National Urban League at their convention in Detroit last week -- the only prominent Republican making an appeal on his party's behalf. To his credit, Mr. Kemp performed admirably and won respect and warm applause from the black delegates.    The rest of the convention's rhetoric was more familiar. The Rev. Jesse Jackson branded Vice President Bush &quot;morally unfit to lead this nation,&quot; because he was a member of the Reagan administration that opposed the Civil Rights Restoration Act. Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis played on the absence of his opponent, &quot;I hope you will note who's here and who isn't here.&quot;    The Vice President, who did speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People four weeks ago, cited a scheduling conflict in declining the Urban League's invitation. It seems this was the week his campaign had scheduled to launch the foreign-policy issue, and Mr. Bush was off giving a well-conceived but stumblingly delivered foreign-policy speech in Texas. The Vice President should make every effort to make it clear that Rep. Kemp was speaking in his name when he promised &quot;George Bush is going to seek the votes of blacks.&quot;    Mr. Bush should make overtures to black voters for moral reasons; it is not good for the country that one party so completely dominates the vote of any minority. But there may be political benefits as well. For the first time in recent memory, the Republicans have a real chance to make inroads into the black vote. The polite, tepid response Mr. Dukakis received suggests that he should not count on monopolizing the black vote this fall, and many Urban League delegates said that they are willing to give the Republican nominee a fair hearing before the November election.    This is partly because of a lingering resentment among blacks that Rev. Jackson was passed over, and a bit rudely at that, in Mr. Dukakis's selection of a running mate. A Gallup Poll conducted shortly after the Democratic National Convention found that one-third of black voters were less likely to vote for Mr. Dukakis because of his handling of the Jackson matter.    But the opportunity is broader than that. Black leaders are starting to recognize that they do not profit when one party has nothing to lose and the other nothing to gain. Younger blacks, in particular, feel less emotionally committed to the Democratic Party. Blacks 18 to 29 years of age (the fastest-growing cohort of black voters) are twice as likely to vote Republican, according to a survey last year by the Washington-based Joint Center for Political Studies.    And as Mr. Kemp made clear, many Republican messages do go over well with blacks, especially the educated, upwardly mobile blacks like those who attended the Urban League convention. He spoke of the need to create safe neighborhoods, to nurture strong families, and to expand economic opportunity by bringing the private marketplace to bear, creating more jobs and more economic growth. These are themes that Mr. Bush would be wise to borrow in a specific approach to blacks.    Rep. Kemp and New Jersey Governor Tom Kean have been energetic in reaching out to blacks, but few others in the GOP have even asked for black votes. Forty years have passed since blacks became disaffected with the Republican Party, and now there are signs that a rapprochement might be possible. But no one will vote for a candidate unless he asks them to, and it's up to Mr. Bush to make the invitation clear and unmistakable. </TEXT></DOC>
