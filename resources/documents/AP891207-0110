Scorsese and Biennale Festival director Paolo Portoghesi werecleared of violating Italian laws on obscenity and blasphemy in theshowing of the movie at the Venice Film Festival.   Judges initially decided to take no action against Scorsese orthe festival organizer. But an appeals court in Rome ruled the caseshould be considered by a Venice criminal court, which foundScorsese and Portoghesi innocent.   The Rome court's upholding of the acquittal is final, becausethe Supreme Court has declined to accept the case.   Protesters who prompted the criminal case in fall 1988 said themovie was sacrilegious, particularly a scene in which Jesushallucinates on the cross about abandoning his role as redeemer,making love to Mary Magdalene and raising a family with her.</TEXT><DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge ruled that anair-conditioner repairman who believes his father is doo-wop singerDion DiMucci cannot bring a paternity lawsuit.   Dion Ambrogio, 32, is 10 years too late in suing, Palm BeachCircuit Judge Walter Colbath said Wednesday, citing a state lawthat bars a paternity action once the child reaches age 22.   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Ambrogio. ``Dion wantign contributions madeon a particular day, the agency'scomputer found nearly three dozen separate $1,000 donations fromKeating associates or family members to then-Sen. Chic Hecht,R-Nev. Keating himself was not on the list on the day checked, Nov.18, 1988.   The law prohibits anyone from making a donation on behalf ofsomeone else. For instance, Keating could not have his corporateofficers give $1,000 each under their names and reimburse themlater to skirt the donation limit.   Moxley said, however, the law is unclear on whether someonecould ask his associates to contribute without reimbursing them.   McCain said in his request to the FEC that representatives ofhis 1982 and 1984 House campaigns, and his Senate campaign of 1986,``assure me that on their face those contributions comply withfederal election law.''   ``If these contributions resulted from illegal activities of thecorporations who employed these contributors, it is not evident inthe committees' records or on publicly available information,'' hesaid.   But McCain expressed concern that any ``potentially illegalaction by corporations and contributors be reviewed as rapidly aspossible.''   McCain received $112,000 in campaign contributions from Keatingand associates, and promised to ``promptly refund'' any money givenimproperly. He previously announced he was reimbursing AmericanContinental $13,433 for flights he and his family took aboardKeating's corporate plane to and from the Bahamas in 1984-86.   DeConcini received $48,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign butannounced he was returning the money.   Cranston, the No. 2 Senate Democrat as majority whip, received$39,000 in campaign money. He solicited from Keating $850,000 forthree voter education projects in California and $85,000 for theCalifornia Democratic Party. The FEC has jurisdiction only overcontributions for federal campaigns.   Glenn received $34,000 in direct contributions and a politicalaction committee associated with him was given $200,000.   Riegle received $76,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign butannounced he was returning the money.</TEXT></DOC>
