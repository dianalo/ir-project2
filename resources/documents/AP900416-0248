(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nintendo of America said Monday it hasfiled lawsuits in several U.S. and Canadian courts to stop the saleof counterfeit copies of its popular video games, and the companypromised more suits.   ``What's happening here is an outrageous theft of Nintendo'svaluable intellectual property rights,'' said Howard Lincoln,company senior vice president. He said counterfeit cartridges werebeing manufactured in Taiwan.   Nintendo said lawsuits for copyright infringement have beenfiled in federal courts in Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Tampa,Fla., and in Canadian federal court in Ottawa against defendants inQuebec, Ontario and British Columbia.   The company said it would file additional suits within twoweeks. It said it was acting because counterfeit activity has grownmarkedly the past month.   A sting operation in Wilmington, N.C., led to the arrestThursday of four people and the seizure of 700 counterfeitcartridges after the company joined forces with undercover U.S.Customs agents, who allegedly were offered the cartridges for$60,000, Nintendo said.   The company said it was aiming its legal actions againstcounterfeiters, video rental outlets and other retailers,distributors and importers who rent or sell the cartridges.   A typical counterfeit cartridge contains many games, is abouthalf the size of Nintendo's cartridges and come with an adapter touse on Nintendo's system, the company said.   Lincoln said Nintendo does not sell ``multiple game cartridges.''   The lawsuits ask that defendants be stopped from distributing,advertising, promoting and selling counterfeit cartridges. Nintendoalso seeks monetary damages.   The four people arrested in North Carolina included a Taiwanesecouple, Sylvie and Paul Sun, said Nintendo. Also arrested were KennKetchum and Brad Ison of Tampa, Fla. Each was charged withtrafficking in counterfeit goods.   Ketchum and Ison were named, along with Gary Brinson, in thesuit filed in Tampa, said Lynne Gray, of the public relations firmof Hill and Knowlton Inc. in Los Angeles.   Named in the suit filed in Los Angeles was Herschel Naghi, doingbusiness as Space Video, said Gray.   Defendants in the Minneapolis suit included Bigelow Distributingand various Bigelow Video stores in several locations, RobertBigelow, Laurence Bigelow, Niles Bigelow, Sunshine Video, CenturyVideo andamp; Tanning, Rodney William Reif and Patricia Ann Reif, ValleyVideo, Chanhassen Video, Mr. Movies, The Video Library, UnitedStates Video, Video Update and Video Shuttle Network, as well asindividuals.   Nintendo said it has had to battle counterfeiters before. In theearly 1980s, the company initiated more than 30 lawsuits across thecountry to stop production of counterfeit copies of the game DonkeyKong.</TEXT></DOC>
