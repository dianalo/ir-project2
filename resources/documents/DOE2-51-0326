During the last years basic research has indicated thatnatural gas storage in man made caverns should be a good solution forgas storage in Scandinavia. This paper shows that it is technically andeconomically feasible to store gas in unlined rock caverns at a depthof about 900 m. Critical issues to be considered in ongoing researchprogram are: Gas behaviour in cracks and fissures; layout and miningtechnique; time estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
