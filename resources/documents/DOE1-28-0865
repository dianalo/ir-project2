Essentially, the 1995 objectives will continue the basicpolicies established by the two previous sets of objectives for 1985and 1990. Their main aspects are to: obtain a further energy efficiencyimprovement of at least 20%; limit oil consumption to around 40% of totalenergy consumption and maintain the EC's level of oil imports at no morethan one third of total energy consumption in 1995; maintain the marketshare of natural gas (currently 19% of our energy requirements); increasethe share of solid fuels in the Community's energy consumption (currently22%) and to improve the competitiveness of the Community's indigenoussolid-fuels production; limit the share of hydrocarbons in electricityproduction to less than 15%; and substantially increase the contributionfrom new and renewable energies.</TEXT></DOC>
