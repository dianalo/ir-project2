Boesky, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. and former Kidder Peabody executive Martin A. Siegel. The suits demand damages from insider trading in Carnation stock.    The lawsuits seek class-action status and each seeks more than $60 million in damages on behalf of individuals who sold Carnation common stock from July 3, 1984, to Sept. 4, 1984.    The suits -- filed against Mr. Boesky in federal court in Manhattan and against both Kidder Peabody and Mr. Siegel in federal court in Los Angeles -- name as plaintiffs Robert A. Comfort and Charles F. Taplin, who bought and sold Carnation stock during the 1984 period. Carnation, whose stock is no longer publicly traded, is a unit of Nestle S.A. of Switzerland. Kidder Peabody, a unit of General Electric Co., was Carnation's financial adviser in the 1984 takeover of Carnation by Nestle.    Drawing on information previously disclosed by the government, the suits allege that Kidder Peabody and Mr. Siegel each owed fiduciary duties to Carnation and Carnation stockholders, and that Mr. Siegel's alleged disclosure to Mr. Boesky of inside information about Nestle's plans to acquire Carnation violated that duty. The suits claim Carnation holders sold their stock at &quot;artificially depressed and stabilized&quot; prices while Mr. Boesky was holding onto his shares, knowing the value would rise.    According to Securities and Exchange Commission court papers, the Carnation transaction accounted for about 80% of Mr. Boesky's alleged profits from information provided by Mr. Siegel. &quot;The Carnation one was the big hit,&quot; said Roger W. Kirby of the law firm Kaufman Malchman Kaufmann andamp; Kirby in New York, attorneys for the plaintiffs. &quot;It was a once-in-a-lifetime deal, even for Boesky.&quot;    The government charged that Mr. Boesky made about $28.3 million in the Carnation transaction by buying 1.7 million shares before the takeover announcement and selling them afterward when the stock price shot up.    A Kidder Peabody lawyer said the complaint filed against the securities firm is &quot;under review&quot; but declined to comment. Messrs. Boesky and Siegel couldn't be reached for comment.    Six other shareholder lawsuits against Mr. Boesky are pending in federal court in Manhattan, resulting from the financier's allegedly illegal stock trading involving former investment banker Dennis Levine. </TEXT></DOC>
