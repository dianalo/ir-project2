For more than a century, Flat Mountain Pond was ahalf-forgotten back-country trout pond known only to hardysport fishermen and devout hikers who ventured seven miles upinto the vistas of New Hampshire's White Mountains. But todaythe pond is the focus of one of the most bitter environmentalstruggles in the nation, a collision of interests that pitsconservationists who want to preserve the wilderness againstdisabled people who want a whiff of it for themselves.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is a classic confrontation,&quot; says Kenneth Kimball,director of research for the Appalachian Mountain Club, &quot;buta sad one.&quot;   This week, as President Bush prepares to sign theAmericans with Disabilities Act to require increased accessand opportunities for the nation's disabled, a coalition ofenvironmental groups is pressing forward with its effort tostop the U.S. Forest Service from &quot;upgrading&quot; the FlatMountain Pond Trail and installing as many as 13 rusticbridges to permit vehicles to carry disabled people to theedge of the federal Sandwich Range Wilderness.   &quot;This is an issue we hate,&quot; says Emily Bateson, seniorscientist for the Conservation Law Foundation of New England,which is leading the effort to stop the trail upgrade. &quot;Butwe don't want to {put in} a road like this.&quot;   The debate has prompted high emotions among the disabledand among the legions of hikers who regard the WhiteMountains as something of a sanctuary, splitting thetranquility of a corner of New Hampshire that provided arefuge for politicians like Daniel Webster, an inspirationfor writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne, and a brilliantpanorama for landscape artists like Thomas Cole.   &quot;I don't feel we're fighting people in wheelchairs,&quot; saysMichael Kellett, New England regional director of theWilderness Society. &quot;We're fighting an ill-conceived planthat won't benefit many people in wheelchairs.&quot;   Republican state Rep. Raymond Conley, a paraplegic whoused a wheelchair for nearly four decades after beingdisabled as a Navy pilot in the Korean War, responds: &quot;Someof these folks are trying to tell handicapped people wherethey belong. They're saying there are other places that aremore appropriate for us. Who says so? People who can walk andcarry backpacks. There are a lot of well-meaning people whoare making decisions for the disabled.&quot;   The battle has skewed the usual alliances, both here inthe notches of the North Country and in the offices of thefederal bureaucracy. The disabled are siding with thegovernment. Environmentalists are finding themselves in theuncomfortable position of opposing the disabled at a timewhen the disability-rights movement is flush with triumph inCongress. A provision in the bill that Mr. Bush is expectedto sign today specifically permits the creation of access forthe disabled up to a wilderness boundary.   &quot;I'd rather vote against an environmentalist than a guy ina wheelchair,&quot; says GOP Rep. James Hansen of Utah, a HouseInterior Committee member who championed thewilderness-boundary provision in the disability bill. &quot;Mostof these environmentalists don't know one end of a pine treefrom another but they like the calendars they get.&quot;   The trail that is causing all the controversy hugs theboundary of the Sandwich Range Wilderness but doesn't pierceit. The changes call for 13 bridges as long as 46 feet andfor treated decks 10 feet wide, with about 140 feet of woodenraised deck near the end of the trail and a &quot;small, primitiveparking lot away from and out of sight of the pond.&quot;   The access plan would permit four vehicles a day of lessthan 4,000 pounds to follow the path from Sandwich Notch Roadto the summit of Carrigan Outlook, up the top of a highlandsknob, over the east fork of a spring brook, beyond theWonalancet River and on up to Flat Mountain Pond.   And though the trail won't be an upcountry version of theMerritt Parkway or even a rustic Route 66, the specter ofautomobiles plying the sylvan reaches of the Sandwich Rangetroubles environmentalists, who complain about &quot;disruption ofthe wilderness character of the area through noise, roaddevelopment, ruts, fumes and other conflicts.&quot; TheConservation Law Foundation's appeal argues that the upgradewould harm the wilderness by introducing &quot;the sounds, smellsand possibly sights of the internal-combustion engine --which symbolizes the very antithesis of wilderness.&quot;   Rep. Conley argues that the road is merely an improvementof an existing railroad bed (like many parts of the WhiteMountains, the area was heavily logged in the last century)and that environmentalists want to keep the wilderness tothemselves. &quot;The wilderness zealots don't want theinternal-combustion engine ruining their wildernessexperience,&quot; he says. &quot;That's the sum and substance of theirwhole argument.&quot;   The coalition of environmental groups against the planinclude the Sierra Club, the Sandwich Range ConservationAssociation and the Wonalancet Out Door Club; the AppalachianMountain Club, a major voice in the White Mountains, hasn'ttaken a position. The opponents emphasize, however, that theydon't want to exclude the disabled from the White Mountains.   &quot;We want all sorts of handicapped access,&quot; says Ms.Bateson of the Conservation Law Foundation. &quot;But it has to bedone with sensitivity to the resource and the other users. Wecan't carve up our wilderness in the name of thehandicapped.&quot;   Advocates of the Flat Mountain Pond plan are contendingthat the plan wouldn't substantially change the character ofthe area. &quot;The whole idea is to give the handicapped achallenge, not to provide a paved path that a two-wheel-drivecar can go down,&quot; says Douglas Eoute, chief of the bureau oftrails in the New Hampshire Division of Parks.   The Forest Service has a number of campgrounds around thecountry to accommodate the disabled, and it has built severalshort trails of about a hundred yards for wheelchairs. Onewheelchair path, the Sheepshead Trail of Deer Lodge NationalForest in Montana, is about a mile long. But no access pathfor the disabled is as ambitious as that contemplated forFlat Mountain Pond.   Some disabled activists, however, would rather not havesuch an ambitious project. &quot;There's a knee-jerk reaction thatpeople with disabilities need to have motors to get access towilderness areas,&quot; says Gregory Lais, executive director ofWilderness Inquiry, a Minneapolis-based adventure-travelorganization for the disabled. &quot;There needn't be a conflictbetween access for the disabled and preservation ofwilderness.&quot;   No one expects the question to be settled soon or thebitterness to disappear from two sides unwilling tocompromise. &quot;The whole goal of the disabled movement,&quot; saysMichael Jenkins, executive director of the Governor'sCommission on Disability in New Hampshire, &quot;is that 20 yearsfrom now there won't be any issues like this.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
