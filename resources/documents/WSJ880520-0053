The policy, whose announcement came as Brazil posted a record trade surplus in April of $1.91 billion, is part of a broad program to tame Brazil's 600% annual inflation and encourage new economic growth. It is to be followed late next week by details of a previously announced federal budget cut equal to 0.9% of economic output.    As reported, the policy includes removing government controls on 3,000 export items, reducing the ceiling for import tariffs to 85% from 105%, decreasing domestic-content requirements to augment price competitiveness, and establishing a framework for industrial planning by government and business. </TEXT></DOC>
