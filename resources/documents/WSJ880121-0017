Brown III (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AMR </CO><IN> ERN AIR </IN><DATELINE> FORT WORTH, Texas  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines' parent reported an unexpected fourth-quarter net loss of $805,000 despite sharply higher fares, compared with year-earlier profit of $6.6 million, or 11 cents a share.    AMR Corp. blamed the loss largely on a $23.1 million pretax charge from unrealized currency exchange losses on its Japanese yen-denominated debt. It also cited &quot;extraordinarily bad weather&quot; at some of its key cities and traffic lost because of a threatened Christmas strike by its flight attendants. (The strike was averted after American reached a last-minute settlement on a new contract.)    The company also said it had an &quot;unusually high&quot; tax rate during the quarter because it decided to lease several new jets that it originally intended to buy.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, AMR had pretax gains of $14.8 million from the sale of property rights and $2.3 million from foreign currency translations.    Revenue for the quarter rose 26% to $1.88 billion from $1.50 billion a year earlier, in part because of higher fares during the quarter. American said its yield, or average fare per passenger mile, rose 13% in the quarter from a year ago.    Although Wall Street analysts hadn't expected AMR to report a loss, many recently cut their optimistic earnings estimates to about break-even from earlier forecasts of sharply higher net income than a year ago, after AMR warned them to expect a poor quarter.    Analysts disagreed on whether the loss signals a weak quarter for other carriers who haven't reported their results yet. &quot;I'm looking for fairly weak comparisons in the fourth quarter from other carriers,&quot; compared with a year earlier, said Paul P. Karos, an airline analyst with L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co.    But Timothy Pettee, an analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. said American's strong fare increases bode well for other carriers' results. &quot;I think the AMR loss is somewhat of an aberration as far as the rest of the industry,&quot; which won't be affected as much by foreign currency fluctuations, he said. &quot;I'm expecting the yield numbers to be the real bright spot for fourth-quarter earnings.&quot;    Nevertheless, in the wake of AMR's announcement and the drop in the stock market, the stocks of most major airlines closed lower yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, AMR closed at $33 a share, down $1.25. Delta Air Lines closed at $38.875 a share, down 25 cents. Allegis Corp., parent of United Airlines, closed at $72.125 a share, down $1. And on the American Stock Exchange, Texas Air Corp., parent of Continental and Eastern airlines, closed at $10.625 a share, down 62.5 cents.    For the year, AMR said net income fell 29% to $198.4 million, or $3.28 a share, from $279.1 million, or $4.63 a share, in 1986.    Profit in 1987 included a pretax gain of $14.6 million from the sale of property rights and a pretax charge of $32.2 million from unrealized foreign currency exchange losses. Year-earlier profit included a pretax gain of $60.3 million from the sale of three units and a pretax charge of $20.5 million from unrealized foreign currency exchange losses.    Revenue for the year rose 20% to $7.2 billion from $6.02 billion.    Robert L. Crandall, AMR's chairman and president, called the company's 1987 results &quot;disappointing&quot; in a prepared statement. In addition to the fourth-quarter problems, he cited high start-up costs at the company's new hubs in Raleigh/Durham, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn., costs associated with its efforts to improve service, and expenses related to its acquisition last April of AirCal, a West Coast airline. </TEXT></DOC>
