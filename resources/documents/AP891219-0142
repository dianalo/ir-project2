Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 35 degrees below zeroat Bismarck, N.D., not a record.   By noon, temperatures over much of the upper Mississippi Valleyand northern Plains had not risen above zero.   In stark contrast, southern Florida had record warmth in theupper 80s.   Since Friday, at least 38 deaths have been blamed on theweather, including traffic deaths on slippery roads and hypothermia.   Michigan outreach centers pleaded for warm clothes to give tohelp the needy stave off the unusual cold. The average meantemperature in Michigan for the first 18 days of December was 14.1degrees, far below the month's norm of 23.5 degrees.   ``I don't recall a December being quite this cold,'' Detroitpolice Sgt. George Anthony said Tuesday as he leafed throughreports about victims of hypothermia. Two freezing deaths have beenconfirmed in Wayne County and at least three others are believed tobe hypothermia.   An inch or more of snow covered much of the nation north of aline from east-central Virginia across north-central Tennessee,northern Arkansas, southern Colorado and northwestern Utah tonorthwestern Idaho, the National Weather Service said.   At midday, snow fell over western New York state, much of thewestern half of Pennsylvania, eastern and northern Ohio, WestVirginia, much of Virginia, eastern Kentucky, Michigan, Montana,Idaho, western Wyoming and eastern Washington state.   There were no reports of measurable snowfall during the sixhours up to 1 p.m. EST, except in northwestern Indiana, whereWestville had 5 inches of new snow by noon, the weather servicesaid. Up to 4 inches fell early in the day in Illinois.   A winter storm warning, in effect into Wednesday, was postedover northwestern Montana.   Freezing rain fell from northeastern Texas across northernLouisiana and southern Arkansas, and over eastern Tennessee, muchof North and South Carolina and northeastern Georgia, where theaccumulating ice caused scattered power outages and glazed highways.   More than 100 motorists stranded overnight at Hope, Ark., by iceon Interstate 30 were able to get back on the road Tuesday.   ``We escorted about 104 people to the Community Center lastnight, starting around 9 p.m. and finishing at about one thismorning,'' Hope Police Chief Richard Thomas said.   In addition, officials said hotels in the area were full whileother motorists spent the night in their vehicles. ``Wal-Mart'sparking lot was full of 18-wheelers,'' Thomas said.   Some 70 school districts across Arkansas remained closed Tuesdaybecause of the inclement weather. State office workers were underthe state's inclement weather policy, which gives non-essentialadministrative workers until 10 a.m. to arrive without beingdeducted leave time.   Many northern Georgia counties kept their schools closed,although most Atlanta area schools reopened after being closedMonday.   Officials in Griffin, Ga., said ice brought tree limbs down onpower lines there, cutting electricity to large sections of thecity for as long as two hours.   Ice on roads was blamed for accidents around metropolitanAtlanta and Athens, and police blocked off several interstatehighway ramps that were littered with cars and trucks unable tocross slick spots.   Treacherous driving conditions in North Carolina caused at leastone death and scores of traffic accidents, and dozens of schoolsand business closed.   Rain fell from the remainder of Georgia into northern Floridaand northern Alabama, and was scattered along the Gulf of Mexicocoast.   In the mountains of southeastern Wyoming, wind blew at 50 to 60mph near Arlington and near Vedauwoo.   A 200-mile stretch of the Mississippi River, from St. Louis toCairo, Ill., was closed to barge traffic by ice and low water, theU.S. Coast Guard said.   About 60 percent of the 195 miles of Missouri River north ofOmaha, Neb., to the Gavins Point Dam was frozen over Tuesday,forming ice jams that reduced the amount of water flowingdownstream to towns and power plants.   The river level was within one foot of the level at which somepower plants would be unable to operate because their water intakesystems would no longer work, said Chet Worm, chief of thereservoir regulation section of the Corps Missouri River District.   Record low temperatures were 8 at Atlantic City, N.J.; 6 atBaltimore; 10 at Bridgeport, Conn.; 26 below zero at Dickinson,N.D.; 6 below at Elkins, W.Va.; 19 below at Grand Island, Neb.; 5at Harrisburg, Pa.; 20 below at Lincoln, Neb.; 24 below at Norfolk,Neb.; 7 below at Wheat Ridge, Colo.; and 3 below at Youngstown,Ohio.   But in Florida, Miami hit a record high of 85 and West PalmBeach reached a record 88.
