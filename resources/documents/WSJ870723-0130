TraversStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   If you missed the 90th anniversary of the introduction of chop suey to New York City last year, don't despair. There are plenty more milestones to mark.    &quot;Star Wars&quot; is 10 years old this year, Polaroid is 50, and Hollywood is 100. Celebrating such anniversaries has become the trendy way to promote everything from patriotism to canned ham. Over the July 4 weekend, while the nation marked its 211th birthday, the town of Austin, Minn., was celebrating the 50th year of Spam; events in Austin, where the first Spam was canned, included a &quot;hog jog,&quot; a Spam cook-off and a Spam parade.    The biggest celebration, though, is for this year's 200th birthday of the U.S. Constitution. Over 1,500 events are listed by the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, and more than 1,300 &quot;designated bicentennial communities&quot; are participating. &quot;It's hard to keep tabs on all the events that have been planned,&quot; says Steven Gould, a member of the commission.    The Constitution bash will run through 1990, making it a four-year fete. As a result, the celebrating may be stretched a bit thin. &quot;Liberty trees&quot; will be planted across the state of New Mexico. Wyoming is planning scratch-and-win Constitution quiz tickets. And Maryland plans a stirring tribute that includes the distribution of 60,000 lollipops imprinted with a 13-part snake and the words &quot;Unite or Die.&quot;    Why all the hoopla? &quot;Celebrating anniversaries provides us with a tie to the past while at the same time giving us an opportunity to re-experience,&quot; explains Michael Marsden, a professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. &quot;They allow us to share our cultural traditions with others and with our younger generations.&quot;    Cities racing to host Christopher Columbus celebrations have discovered another reason: &quot;There is no doubt that there is a great deal of revenue involved,&quot; says J. Stanley Heiusler II, president of Columbus 500 Baltimore, a group formed to seek and coordinate Columbus-anniversary celebrations for the city. Baltimore is one of eight cities competing for the Grand Columbus Regatta in 1992 -- 500 years after Columbus sailed the ocean blue and found America.    Jubilees are indeed good for both fun and profit. The people at Walt Disney Co. are whistling while they work because this year marks Snow White's 50th anniversary. She had a gala event in her honor at New York's Radio City Music Hall last Friday on the occasion of the re-release of the full-length animated film, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot; Snow White (actually, two Snow Whites) traveled to 40 U.S. cities visiting children's hospitals. The two Disney amusement parks have scheduled events through December.    Ms. White isn't the only movie star with an anniversary. Three changes in actors and 14 films after &quot;Dr. No,&quot; James Bond, that enduring British special agent, is reveling in a quarter of a century of celluloid popularity. Earlier this month, to mark 007's 25th, the New York Museum of Modern Art staged a film festival and an exhibit of props used in past films. &quot;The Faberge eggs smuggled in 'Octopussy' are very popular and so is the shoe with the blade in the heel used in &quot;From Russia With Love,'&quot; says the museum's Howard Feinstein.    Among commemorations planned for other big-name entertainers, Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tenn., will be the site of a week of activities starting Aug. 8 to mark the 10th anniversary of the singer's death. &quot;We are expecting about 50,000 people,&quot; a Graceland representative says.    Magazines are on the celebratory bandwagon, too. Ms. Magazine last month marked its 15th year with a special 230-page anniversary issue. And Rolling Stone magazine is celebrating its 20th year. The magazine is publishing four special issues noting, among other things, those rock 'n' rollers that have influenced &quot;style&quot; and the best 100 albums. A big party is also in the works, says Jann Wenner, the music magazine's founder, publisher and editor in chief.    The National Institutes of Health in Washington is celebrating its 100th anniversary with a yearlong observance. Events have thus far included a centenarians' birthday party sponsored by NIH's Institute on the Aging. Willard Scott, NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show's weatherman, was the host at the party, to which local centenarians were invited.    Also hitting the century mark is super-sleuth Sherlock Holmes. Fans know that means 100 years have passed since the publication of the first novel starring the detective, says Holmes authority John Bennett Shaw of Santa Fe, N.M. &quot;Holmes was born in 1854,&quot; Mr. Shaw explains to the uninitiated.    To mark the centennial, Mr. Shaw is preparing Holmes quizzes he will give at anniversary seminars beginning tomorrow at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., and, subsequently, at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. -- both of which, coincidentally, are involved in anniversary festivities of their own.    William and Mary is planning to celebrate next year not the tricentennial of its charter (which will take place in six years) but the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688 that put William III and Mary II on the throne of England.    &quot;Because of the names of the monarchs and their involvement in the establishment of this college, we are taking an interest in celebrating the event,&quot; says William Walker, a spokesman for the college. Congress last fall passed a bill making the College of William and Mary &quot;the official American representative&quot; to the international celebration. Both the Dutch and the British are also marking the anniversary.    Stanford this year is celebrating its centennial and, at the same time, is trying to raise a few dollars -- 1.1 billion of them, to be exact. Columbia University had its bicentennial in May. There were parades, speeches and a gala fund-raiser hosted by Walter Cronkite. Harvard University pointedly notes that its 350th anniversary last September was celebrated without any fund-raisers -- though it probably didn't give back any donations generated by such events as bringing Prince Charles to the Cambridge, Mass., campus.    Some folks can't wait 350 years to celebrate. This September, Gannett Co. will throw a big bash for USA Today. Thousands of invited guests will get commemorative buttons showing them pictured on the front page of the newspaper. The venerable publication will be five years old. </TEXT></DOC>
