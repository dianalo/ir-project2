Fitzwater said it is ``interesting that there should be thisseries of statements,'' but ``the clearest signal they could sendis to release the hostages.''   In New York, Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the UnitedNations, said: ``We have said that we will not make deals on thisparticular issue. We are very interested in getting them (thehostages) out. And if they want to talk, we will be prepared totalk, but that is a speculative question.''   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., told reporters Tuesday, ``I don'tthink we can ignore anything that comes our way. But I think weshould reject anything that smacks of ransom or blackmail and thissounds like both.''   State Department officials said Iranian officials had madeproposals similar to Rafsanjani's previously and the Reaganadministration had rejected them.   The officials said they assume Rafsanjani was referring tomilitary equipment which had been purchased by the Iraniangovernment during the reign of the Shah of Iran but had not beendelivered.   President Carter withheld all such deliveries after the hostagecrisis began. Carter also refused to return to Iran militaryequipment which Iranian authorities had sent back to the UnitedStates for repair.   The officials said they had no dollar figure on the militaryequipment on which Iran has a claim.</TEXT></DOC>
