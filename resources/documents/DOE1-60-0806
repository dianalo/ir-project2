To overcome the detrimentaleffect of DNA damage, cells developed a repair mechanism by which damagedDNA is repaired. In the absence of such repair, cell malfunction or celldeath can occur. Two most studied radiation-induced DNA damage are thyminedimer formation by UV irradiation and psoralen crosslink by combinationof psoralens and UV: In the former, two adjacent thymine bases on a strandof DNA are fused by forming cyclobutane ring, and in the latter, onepyrimidine on one DNA strand is crosslinked to another pyrimidine onthe other strand via a psoralen. The authors' objective is to deducethe structure of DNA segment which contains a psoralen crosslink or athymine dimer using the combination of results of X-ray crystallographicstudies, molecular model building, and energy minimization. These structuralfeatures may be important for understanding the biological effects ofsuch damages and for the recognition by the repair enzymes.</TEXT></DOC>
