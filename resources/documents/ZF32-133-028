Morris tossed into the Internet wentwild well over a year ago, but I wonder if anybody really rembmers itsimplications.andM;An independent study commissioned by Certus International Corp., a Clevelandsecurity software manufactuer, reveals chilling information.andM;As of January 1991, about 26 percent of U.S.andP;  enterprises had computerviruses on at least some of their IBM and compatible PCs.andP;  Certus presidentPeter S. Tippett (ironically, a physician) said the computer virus problem isworsening by about 160 percent per quarter.andM;&quot;By May or June of this year, an average organization of 400 PCs or more willhave a 50-50 chance of encountering a computer virus each month.&quot;andP;  Tippettsaid.andM;If the computer virus situation is left unchecked, most organizations willhave a 100 percent probability of monthly computer virus episodes, he said.andM;If you are tempted to discount Tippett's perspective as one generated mainlyby self-interest, remember he is not alone in his opinion.andM;Bill Murray, an IS security consultant for consulting firm Deloit Touche inNew York, said:  &quot;We are in the imminent stages of a computer virus epidemic.andO;Only pervasive, protective intervention can prevent virus disasters fromspreading at an alarming rate.&quot;andM;Most PCs in the government and other large organizations are linked in someway to each other or other kinds of computers.andP;  They may act as servers formultiple local area networks, or connect to mainframes that hold vitalinformation.andP;  They may communicate to other occassionally by moderm or faxcard.andM;In theory, at least, a virus program on a single contaminated PC could infector destroy all the data residing on a critical federal nationwide informationsystem.andM;Recent articles in GCN indicate that agencies in the federal government aretesting and using encryption devices that scramble sensitive but unclassifiedinformation sent over the FTS 2000 network.andM;In a GCN Buyers Guide that will appear in July, I report on other low-costencryption devices that can provide considerable data protection for federalcomputer installations.andM;Certainly, these devices are absolutely necessary.andP;  but the problem is, whileencryption is a requirement, by itself it can't do much to protect anetworked system against invasion of a computer's hard disk bya virus, worm,time bomb or logic bomb.andM;Although they are necessary, password programs, dial-back precautions, smartcards and even encryption devices are maily front-line devices -- they won'tdo much to stop a virus at the gate.andM;Fortunately there are some anti-virus network protections in the form ofrelatively inexpensive programs.andP;  Some work on a network server and send awarning if something in a program is amiss.andP;  Others can load into individualPCs to protect against a virus invasion coming from a contaminated floppydisk.andM;The only problem with these software protections is you have to use them.andO;They can delay your system's performance by a small amount, and generallysomebody has to monitor the system regularly to make sure that all is well.andO;but, this seems a small price topay, given the alternative.andM;J.B.andP;  Miles writes about networking and wide area communications from SanDiego.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
