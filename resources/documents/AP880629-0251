Also Wednesday, U.S.-backed Angolan rebels fighting the Marxistgovernment said they captured a town on the Benguela railroad, theprincipal route for transporting minerals from Zaire, Zambia andeastern Angola to the Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito.   South African military headquarters said Monday's clash at thedam was one of the biggest yet between South African and Cubanforces. It reported 12 South African deaths, including 11 soldierskilled by a stray bomb aimed at the dam during an air raid.   South Africa's losses represent its highest acknowledged deathtoll from a single engagement since its forces expanded their rolein Angola more than a year ago.   The South African government said the attack on the damjeopardized peace talks aimed at resolving the 13-year-old war.   The dam outside Calueque supplies water to South African-heldSouth-West Africa, also known as Namibia. It is about 30 milesnorth of the border.   South Africa protected the dam under an agreement with Portugal,which ruled Angola until independence in 1975. The attack damagedthe dam wall, the military said.   Angola's official news agency, ANGOP, said Angolan forces actedto check a northward South African advance. It said a heavyconcentration of South African troops close to the dam had become astaging point for attacks.   ANGOP said eight Angolan soldiers were killed and four wounded.It quoted unidentified military sources as saying 26 white SouthAfrican soldiers were killed.   The ANGOP report, monitored in Lisbon, Portugal, made no mentionof Cuban forces.   Foreign Minister R.F. ``Pik'' Botha said the attack ``confirmsCuba's aggressive intentions'' and said an ongoing peace initiativeis in jeopardy.   South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United States have held threerounds of talks since May, including discussions last weekend inCairo, Egypt. A fourth round is scheduled next month in the UnitedStates.   UNITA, or National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,said its guerrillas seized the town of Ganda in western Benguelaprovince Monday.
