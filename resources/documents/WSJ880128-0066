Bulkeley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> APCI </CO><IN> CEO </IN><DATELINE> CHELMSFORD, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Apollo Computer Inc. expects to report that fourth-quarter net income nearly doubled the $5.3 million, or 15 cents a share, it earned the year earlier, the company's chairman and chief executive officer said.    Thomas A. Vanderslice also said the company expects to report that sales were &quot;strongly higher&quot; than analysts' expectations of about $150 million for the quarter. In the year-ago quarter, sales were $120.9 million, indicating an increase of more than 25%.    Mr. Vanderslice said, &quot;We have renewed momentum. Our growth rate is really starting to pick up again.&quot; He added that sales have grown to the point where they easily cover the cost of Apollo's large manufacturing facilities and world-wide sales and service infrastructure. As a result, he said, profit margins in the future should be better than in the past.    &quot;I'd be very disappointed if 1988 results aren't records,&quot; he said, noting that there aren't any signs yet of an economic downturn that might hurt computer industry sales. He declined to be more specific.    The officer's comments on the fourth quarter suggest that earnings for the full year were about $21 million, or 59 cents a share, up sharply from $9.3 million, or 27 cents a share in 1986. He indicated Apollo would report sales of more than $550 million, up 40% from $391.7 million in 1986.    The earnings growth comes despite an embarrassing third-quarter loss of $6.5 million caused by unauthorized foreign currency trading by an employee.    Apollo makes engineering workstations -- high-powered personal computers for engineers -- that are linked together in networks. The company invented the workstation in 1980 and dominated the market until last year when it was surpassed by fast-growing Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.    Mr. Vanderslice said although the company has lost some major contract battles to Sun, it also is winning many. He said it won a $100 million contract from Siemens AG in October and has held onto its largest customer, Beaverton, Ore.-based Mentor Graphics Corp., which signed a $100 million, 18-month contract in June.    He also pointed to smaller awards such as a recent $12.4 million contract to supply workstations for California Department of Transportation highway engineers in which Apollo was said to have underbid Sun by $163,000.    Sun has grown faster than Apollo by cutting prices aggressively and by encouraging use of Unix, an American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.-designed operating system that runs on many different computers.    Apollo gradually has added Unix capabilities and analysts estimate that 60% of its workstations now are sold with the Unix operating system.    Mr. Vanderslice also said Apollo has better systems for networking many workstations together than competitors, so as customers link more workstations into networks, Apollo should do well.    Next week, the company is expected to announce a new generation of its Domain operating system, including a distributed operating system for Unix, simplifying operations on linked computers.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,the company's stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $13.50 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
