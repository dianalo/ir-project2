Laurans A. Mendelson, a longtime Florida real estate developer who heads Columbia Ventures, a closely held investment company, said his 19-year-old son, Victor, a political science major at Columbia University, researched Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger while working as an intern in his father's office last summer. Victor found Harnischfeger to be an undervalued company, and &quot;on the basis of his initial work, we bought it,&quot; Mr. Mendelson said.    An investment group headed by Columbia Ventures -- and including both of Mr. Mendelson's sons, among others -- disclosed last October that it had a 7.3% stake in Harnischfeger, a maker of mining and earth-moving equipment. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week, the group said it proposed to acquire the remaining 18.7 million Harnischfeger common shares for $19 each, or more than $356 million. A Harnischfeger spokesman said the company's board will meet to consider the bid, but declined to comment further.    The company behind the offer, Columbia Ventures, was formed about two years ago by Mr. Mendelson and another longtime Florida developer, Jerry A. Gross, Columbia Venture's president. The company takes its name from Columbia University, where Mr. Mendelson was an undergraduate and a business student. Mr. Mendelson said the two men, who are the company's sole owners, turned their attention to stocks after the south Florida real-estate market went soft around 1983.    The Harnischfeger bid isn't their first such effort. Last year, a group led by Columbia Ventures acquired a 6.1% interest in Akron, Ohio-based McNeil Corp. Mr. Mendelson said the group was discussing a possible takeover of McNeil, but instead sold its shares to Pentair Inc., which in the meantime had offered to acquire all McNeil's outstanding stock.    The year before, Columbia Enterprises Inc., another company owned by the two developers, led a group making an unsolicited takeover bid for Mohasco Corp. Mohasco's board rejected the proposal, and it eventually repurchased the 9.4% stake in its shares owned by the Columbia Enterprises group. Both sides said Mohasco didn't pay a premium for the shares, and that greenmail wasn't involved.    Both Mr. Mendelson and Mr. Gross seem to be well-regarded locally as investors. One prominent investment banker here who isn't directly involved with them -- Peter L. Bermont, first vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. -- calls the two &quot;very bright guys,&quot; adding that they &quot;have been pretty smart in the market.&quot;    Mr. Mendelson is a certified public accountant, and Mr. Gross is an attorney. But for most of the past 17 years, they've devoted their energies to real-estate development, which they've directed from the square marble-top desk they share in their office overlooking Biscayne Bay. Recently, they've curtailed those efforts. They built only two hotels in Florida last year, one in Jacksonville and the other in Key West, with a total value of $11 million.    Describing his son's activities last summer, Mr. Mendelson said that Victor researched at least fifty companies as investment possibilities before coming up with two names at the end of the summer, one of which was Harnischfeger. His son also accompanied him to meetings in Akron, where they met with McNeil's chairman, investment bankers and lawyers. &quot;We went to address the board, just myself and Victor,&quot; Mr. Mendelson said.    Mr. Mendelson declined to discuss the Harnischfeger bid, but in a letter to Harnischfeger's board he said the Columbia Ventures group intended to retain Harnischfeger's current management and run the company according to management's current plans. </TEXT></DOC>
