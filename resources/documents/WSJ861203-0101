Shrewd real estate investorisn't one of them. Though he bought thousands of acres in theWest, Mr. Hughes resisted pressures to sell or develop hisidle land. Yet for all his seeming obliviousness to the moneyto be made in development, time and urban sprawl have turneda number of his tracts into immensely valuable holdings.   The prime case is Playa Vista, a 957-acre swath of tidal marsh and fields along the California coast between Santa Monica and Los Angeles International Airport. Surrounded on three sides by burgeoning Los Angeles and Marina del Rey, Playa Vista is believed to be the largest -- and most valuable -- undeveloped urban land parcel in the country. Though Howard Hughes Properties declines to place a market value on the property, some local builders estimate its value at about $1 billion.    With the Hughes heirs clamoring to cash in the estate's value, Playa Vista, the place where Mr. Hughes built the legendary &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; plywood aircraft and where children today fly kites, is about to be developed. Los Angeles recently annexed most of Playa Vista, and a master plan for its development has been approved. In 1987, development will begin.    TO MANY OBSERVERS, the site will be a bonanza for whoever develops it. &quot;It's one of the finest pieces of land that you can find,&quot; says Sanford Goodkin, a Marina del Rey, Calif., housing consultant. &quot;You could build almost anything there -- housing, offices, retail -- and it would be a sure-fire success.&quot; Adds Rob Maguire of Maguire/Thomas Partners, a Los Angeles-based office developer: &quot;It's a terrific location.&quot;    The tract owes its appeal to the explosive growth of the west side of Los Angeles in recent years as affluent residents have sought respite from the smog and traffic congestion farther inland. Playa Vista is also close to the airport and the ocean.    Not surprisingly, some of the nation's biggest builders are jockeying for the first 150-acre parcel that Hughes Properties plans to sell. &quot;The interest is overwhelming,&quot; says N. David O'Malley, executive vice president of Hughes Properties, a subsidiary of Summa Corp.    However, Mr. O'Malley is just as concerned about how well the land is developed as how quickly it is developed. Playa Vista offers a rare opportunity to create a whole new community. As Mr. O'Malley says, &quot;It's not project development. It's city building.&quot;    Under the city-approved plan, Playa Vista can accommodate six million square feet of office space, 800,000 square feet of retail space, 2,400 hotel rooms, 8,800 residences, and a 40-acre marina. To ease concerns about the impact on the local environment, $10 million will be spent to restore 215 acres of degraded tidal marsh into a wildlife refuge that will be managed by the National Audubon Society. The costs of new streets -- including 22 new lanes of roadway -- and other services are expected to run $200 million.    CONSIDERING THE SIZE of the tract, the density of development envisioned is low: Only half a square foot of building is planned for every square foot of land. By contrast, areas like L.A.'s Century City have five square feet of building for every foot of land. The political realities of getting city approvals for development in the face of neighbors' opposition underlie the low density planned for Playa Vista.    Pat Russell, the City Council member for the area, says that Hughes Properties initially wanted Playa Vista to be all offices, retail establishments and hotels, and at much higher density. Hughes at first also offered to save only 75 acres of wetlands. &quot;I told them it could be a world-class development, but it had to be at a lower density,&quot; Ms. Russell says. &quot;In addition, I said it needs to be a balanced community, with housing for various income groups, and must protect more wetlands.&quot;    Hughes Properties finally agreed to the lower density because it has owned the property for 40 years and owes no money on it. &quot;At today's market prices, we couldn't afford to develop it economically at such a low density,&quot; says Mr. O'Malley.    UNLIKE MANY PROJECTS, there are no architectural drawings of what Playa Vista will look like in the year 2000, the expected completion date. However, there are drawings that show the streets and public spaces, including an 8,000-foot formal corridor of greenery that visually links the property's interior with the oceanfront.    The lack of building drawings has aroused suspicion among opponents of the project that Hughes Properties has a secret plan for high-rises. But Mr. O'Malley says the absence of such drawings reflects his emphasis on the public spaces rather than on an &quot;array of pretty buildings.&quot; He adds, &quot;Memorable places are created by public streets and open spaces.&quot;    Mr. O'Malley also resisted illustrative plans because he wants the flexibility to respond to market shifts and new technology in the years ahead. To reassure local interests about its stated interest in quality, Hughes relied on a concept team that included architect Henry Cobb, urban designer Allan Jacobs, landscape architect Laurie Olin and transportation consultant Warren Travers.    Mr. O'Malley sees Playa Vista as a special opportunity. For one thing, he says, &quot;There currently is no urban waterfront setting in L.A. Playa Vista will give it one. This is a unique asset, and we're under pressure to do it well.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
