DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's dominant long-distance telephonecompany, the American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., announced Tuesdaythat it will cut basic, daytime interstate rates an average of 1.3percent Jan. 1. Evening rates will drop an average of 2.0 percent.   ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the reductions were necessaryunder changes earlier this year in the Federal CommunicationsCommission's regulation of long-distance charges.   The FCC now imposes caps on ATandamp;T's long-distance rates based onthe company's long-distance expenses, as opposed to a preset rateof return.   ATandamp;T said the lowered rates reflect reduced expenses, mainlyfrom reduced fees that ATandamp;T will pay in 1990 to local telephonecompanies for access to local exchanges.   John Hauser, a spokesman for ATandamp;T's principal competitor, MCICommunications Corp., said MCI would also pass on savings in localtelephone company access charges. ``We will remain competitive withthem,'' he said.   Hauser's counterpart at US Sprint, Robin Pence, said, ``We arereviewing the filing and we intend to remain competitive.''   ATandamp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long-distance market,as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2with more than 10 percent. US Sprint claims 7 to 8 percent.   In filing notice with the FCC of its intent to lower rates, ATandamp;Testimated that the reductions would save customers $300 million ayear on interstate and international long-distance services usedprimarily by residential and small business customers.   A 10-minute ATandamp;T call during daytime hours on a weekday, toanywhere in the United States, will cost $2.50 or less, an averagedecrease of 1.3 percent.   Linnen said a 10-minute daytime call from Washington to NewYork, which now costs $2.30, would decline to $2.20, a drop of 4.3percent. An evening call from Washington to San Francisco, LosAngeles or Dallas, which now costs $1.67 for 10 minutes, would drop5.3 percent to $1.58. Many of the reductions would be less forother calls.   The Monday-Friday ``day'' calling period is 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.local time. The ``evening'' period is 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sundaythrough Friday.   The ``night'' calling period, for which rates will not change,is from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. Sunday through Friday. ``Weekend''calling rates, identical to the night rates and also unaffected,are in effect all day Saturday and until 5 p.m. Sunday.   International calls from the 48 contiguous states to 25 of themost frequently called countries will be slashed by $104 million.The reductions will vary from country to country; the countrieswill include Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, France,Italy, Israel, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
