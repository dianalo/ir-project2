DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Participants in an interfaith conference on theMiddle East said Wednesday the dialogue between the United Statesand the Palestine Liberation Organization is off to a slow start buthas given impetus to the idea of a Palestinian state.   ``It is self-evident that there hasn't been much of a dialogue,''said Rita Hauser, an international attorney who played a role inencouraging the United States to talk with PLO leaders.   She said none of the discussions between the United States andthe PLO have been ``substantive.''   ``This has given a great deal of concern to many of us becauseobviously the PLO is getting very frustrated as are other people,''she said.   The Bush administration has said that its policy on the MiddleEast is under review. In December, the Reagan administration decidedto drop a 13-year ban and open talks with the PLO. Five meetingshave been held in Tunisia with U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau.   Ms. Hauser said she believes the United States government has``signaled that it is not prepared to renounce the dialogue'' and isengaged in ``a fairly nuanced and sophisticated approach to thequestion in anticipation of a substantive dialogue.''   Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a professor of religion at DartmouthCollege, agreed that the contact with the PLO has been ``modest,''but declared, that ``no matter what may happen to it as diplomaticgames of one kind or another are played, once the United States hasmet with the PLO, a Palestinian state exists.''   ``When it will exist is a question of time, but the meeting withthe PLO has to be understood in historic context as accepting theproposition on the American side that there is a national movementcalled the Palestinians and that the PLO are the people to talkwith.''   The two-day conference, involving Christians, Jews and Moslems,is sponsored by the U.S. Interreligious Committee for Peace in theMiddle East.   In a statement, the committee said it supports ``the Palestinianpeople's right of self-determination, including the option of anindependent state in the West Bank and Gaza pledged to live in peacewith Israel.''   A rival group, the Jewish Committee on the Middle East, handedout a flier at the meeting saying that none of its members had beeninvited to participate although Hertzberg and others who it saidoppose its positions were among the speakers.   The Jewish Committee on the Middle East said it favors an end to``huge economic and military subsidies'' of Israel by the UnitedStates. It also said it is for ``mutual recognition between Israeland the new State of Palestine.''</TEXT></DOC>
