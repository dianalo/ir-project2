Sandamp;P, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., sued the CBOE inNovember, charging the options exchange with breach of aten-year licensing pact, signed in 1983, under which the CBOEwas granted exclusive right to use the Sandamp;P 100 and Sandamp;P 500indexes as the basis for exchange-traded options.</LP><TEXT>   The CBOE, however, had recently been asserting that itslicense to the indexes was broader.   The dispute began last summer, when the underwriterswithdrew what was to have been an offering of $110 million infive-year notes, at an interest rate linked to theappreciation of the Sandamp;P 500 index over the life of the bonds.Sandamp;P said at the time that the underwriters withdrew theoffering -- by the country of Denmark -- &quot;apparently due to alegal disagreement between Sandamp;P and the CBOE&quot; over whether theChicago exchange has the right to exclusively market anysecurity with a return based on movement of the indexes.   Sandamp;P and the CBOE said yesterday that they have &quot;signed anew agreement to extend CBOE's license to trade put and calloptions&quot; on the two stock indexes. In addition, they saidthey have &quot;agreed to terminate&quot; the litigation that began inNovember, under which Sandamp;P asked the court to terminate the1983 contract, or, alternatively, to rule that the pactdoesn't extend to financial instruments other than theoptions spelled out in the original agreement.   An Sandamp;P spokeswoman said the new agreement extends CBOE'srights to use the popular Sandamp;P 500 index through 1998. As tothe exchange's perception that its license was broader thanthat stated in the original pact, the &quot;mutually satisfactory&quot;new agreement &quot;did clarify&quot; the relationship, she said. Shedeclined to elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
