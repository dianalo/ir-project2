On a 62-38 vote, the Senate turned aside an amendment that wouldhave trimmed the funds earmarked for placing the existing 50 MXmissiles on railroad cars _ a budget-cutting step the House tooklast week.   ``If we have that kind of unraveling over here, we go toconference with a totally illogical, unsound program ... and Ibelieve that will be detrimental to both our national security andour arms control,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the ArmedServices Committee, said as the Senate resumed consideration of itsversion of the $295 billion fiscal 1990 defense bill.   The Senate also approved, 93-7, a non-binding resolutionexpressing the sense of the chamber that ``it is not presentlyprudent or possible to commit to the procurement of an operationalforce'' of B-2 stealth bombers.   Lawmakers have criticized the plan to build 132 of theradar-evading planes at a cost of $70 billion, or $530 million perplane.   The House last week voted to strictly limit the program infiscal 1990, pressing the Pentagon to come up with a cheaperprogram. But the Senate kept the administration's programrelatively intact, making a modest cut of $300 million.   Voting against the B-2 resolution today were Sens. Dan Coats,R-Ind.; Bob Dole, R-Kan.; Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.;James McClure, R-Idaho; Don Nickels, R-Okla., and Steve Symms,R-Idaho.   In floor debate on the MX amendment, Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.,argued against the cut, saying it would ``blow apart the carefullycrafted compromise'' reached by the White House and congressionalleaders on money for the MX and mobile Midgetman missiles.   Following the verbal pact, Bush proposed spending $1.1 billionto move multiple-warhead MX missiles from fixed silos to rail carsand $100 million on the single-warhead Midgetman missile in theyear beginning Oct. 1.   Last week, however, the House approved a $502 billion cut in theMX program and elimination of all of the money earmarked for theMidgetman.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., sponsor of the MX amendment, urged hiscolleagues to do the same.   ``We should not be writing a blank check on two mobilesystems,'' said Levin. He said spending on both missiles isinconsistent with the United States' position to ban mobilemissiles in strategic arms reduction talks.   The rejected amendment called for using the $502 million for theF-14D Tomcat jet fighter, the Navy's carrier aircraft that Bush hasslated for elimination; the Army's Apache helicopter and cleanup ofnuclear waste sites.   The Senate also planned to vote on burden-sharing measuresintroduced by Nunn, who argued that the United States should limitthe number of U.S. troops in Europe and negotiate with Japan onpaying for its own defense.   ``There can be no free lunches and no free rides,'' Nunn saidMonday in introducing the amendments.   One Senate burden-sharing amendment would impose a ceiling onthe ratio of U.S. forces stationed in Europe compared to other NATOforces in Europe. Nunn said U.S. forces comprise about 10 percentof the total NATO troop strength in Europe and under his amendment,any increase in the ratio could not exceed 1 percentage point.   Nunn argued that the measure would strengthen the NATO positionin conventional arms reduction talks with the Warsaw Pact nationsand dissuade U.S. allies from unilateral reductions before anagreement is reached.   ``This would put an arrow in President Bush's quiver,'' Nunnsaid, adding that the measure sends a message to U.S. allies: ``Ifyou cut unilaterally, we're not going to be left holding the bag.''   The second amendment calls on Japan to increase its security andforeign aid program and requires Bush to negotiate an agreement``providing for complete offset by Japan of the costs of deployingU.S. forces in defense of Japan.''   Japan spends a little more than 1 percent of its gross nationalproduct on defense, while the United States spends about 6 percent.Japan contributes about $2 billion _ 40 percent of the total U.S.cost _ for American troops stationed there, Nunn said.   The third measure was a non-binding resolution urging the UnitedStates and South Korea to discuss the possibility of somereductions of U.S. forces from the Asian country. The provisionalso asks Bush to prepare a five-year plan on U.S. militarypresence in South Korea.   On Monday, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendmentexpanding the liability of the B-2 manufacturer forcontractor-caused defects on the stealth bomber.   Levin, sponsor of the measure, had complained that repairs ofcostly defects would be paid by the Pentagon, not Northrop Corp.,and increase the price of the plane, which at $530 million a copyis the most expensive in history.   The House, meanwhile, voted 382-29 to approve a bill providing$8.7 billion for military construction projects and for maintenanceand construction of housing for service personnel.   The bill passed without controversy after a group of lawmakersbacked away from their plan to exempt some military bases scheduledto be closed under the government's overall base consolidation plan.   Although $262.7 million below the level approved for the currentfiscal year, the bill contains $500 million toward implementing therecommendations of the base closing commission in the yearbeginning Oct. 1.   The closings, which promise long-term savings, are expected tocost more than $4 billion over the next few years.</TEXT></DOC>
