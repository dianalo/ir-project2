Other refugees, out of money for bribes and payments, say theycan only wait and hope the U.S. crackdown that began Feb. 21 willease.   ``There's been a large increase in smuggling people,'' said JuanA. Garcia, assistant chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in McAllen,Texas. ``They've resorted to going through smugglers to see ifthey're able to get them farther into the United States.''   David Trevino, a supervisor of the Border Patrol's intelligenceunit, said there are 1,500 to 2,000 Central Americans on the Mexicanside of the border waiting to cross, up from 200 to 300 before thenew policy went into effect.   Until Feb. 21, refugees could enter the United States atBrownsville, Texas, the nearest U.S. point to Central America. Mostapplied for political asylum and lived in the United States untiltheir status was determined.   But the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said mostrefugees have experienced economic hardship and need not fearpolitical persecution. In an effort to stem the flow, the INS beganinterviewing refugees as soon as they crossed the border.   In the first week, the agency granted only 16 of 370 petitionsfor asylum, and detained the others pending deportation proceedings.   The result was a backup in this town just south of Brownsville onthe Rio Grande, as some Central Americans fled the threat ofdetention in the United States and others searched for a new, andillegal, way across the border.   Trevino said smuggling cases detected in the area have doubledfrom four to eight a day. Most of the refugees are trying to reachHouston, from which they can travel to other parts of the UnitedStates.   ``A lot them are transported to just before a checkpoint anddropped off. They walk around the checkpoint and are picked up onthe other side,'' Garcia said. The checkpoints are surrounded byfarmland, and Garcia said it's impossible to monitor all the rivercrossings.   Meanwhile, many Central Americans said that while crossing theriver has become tougher, paying smugglers to take them to othercrossing points or further into the United States is not an option.   ``We came and we've found that we can't get in, that there arenew laws and now we're trapped here without money and we can'tcross,'' said Margarita Saavedra, 45, a Nicaraguan at the Casa JuanDiego, a Roman Catholic-run shelter for the poor.   She said she had been waiting 13 days with her 80-year-oldmother. They tried paying a smuggler $30, but the ``coyote''abandoned them on a riverbank outside Matamoros.   ``If we can, we'll try again. If not, we'll go back toGuatemala,'' where they went after they first left Nicaragua, saidher mother, Angela Pena.   A Nicaraguan woman named Yolanda, who refused to give her lastname, said she fled for several reasons. She said she wasn't beingpaid enough for long hours at a child welfare center and was beingharassed because of her friendship with a rebel leader fightingNicaragua's leftist government.   She left her husband and two children behind, but took her12-year-old son along because he is close to draft age.   A shelter worker said the shelter's population had shot up to 60,all but three Central Americans, in recent days.   ``They are waiting for a better time to pass when there is lesssurveillance,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   He said 40 to 50 people also left the shelter this week, sayingthey were going home. Mexican immigration authorities were notbothering the Central Americans, he said.   At a small hotel in Matamoros, a 31-year-old Mexican whofrequently takes people across the border said he was finding it``very, very difficult.''   The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the group of adozen with him were all Mexicans; however, members of the groupspoke with Central American accents and a hotel worker said theywere Hondurans.   Many Central Americans identify themselves as Mexicans so theywill be returned to Mexico and not be deported to their homelands.   The group said it was down to its last $1.50. Asked about otherborder points, such as Tijuana, 2,000 miles away in Baja, Calif.,the Mexican said:   ``You know what it would cost to go to Tijuana? 110,000 pesos,''about $47. He said he prefers taking people across in Brownsvillebecause it's closer to jobs in the eastern United States.   ``We're going to wait to see if they go to sleep,'' he said ofthe Border Patrol. ``And if not we're going to cross and maybethey'll catch us.''</TEXT></DOC>
