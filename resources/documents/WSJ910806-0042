U.S.-built cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rateof 6,710,000 cars in the July 21-31 period, up slightly from6,650,000 in the mid-July period. For the entire month,domestic cars sold at an annual pace of 6.8 million, comparedwith a 6.7 million adjusted annual pace in June.</LP><TEXT>   The late-July selling rate is &quot;slightly below expectationsbut consistent with something that can be called a recovery,&quot;said Scott F. Merlis, analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;Youcan still look at the cup half full instead of half empty.&quot;   Auto makers said they are encouraged that the emergingrecovery will continue. &quot;Although the industry is not yet outof the woods, the pickup in annual selling rates during Julyhas been encouraging, signaling better sales days ahead,&quot;said James B. Fitzpatrick, General Motors Corp.'s vicepresident of communications and marketing staff.   Auto dealers said that showroom traffic fluctuates fromweek to week but that more of the shoppers now seem intent onbuying. &quot;Traffic is not as brisk as we like, but the peoplecoming are buyers,&quot; said Robert Fleisher, vice president ofFranklin Park Lincoln Mercury, Toledo, Ohio.   Still, vehicle sales are trailing year-earlier levels.Overall, Americans bought 408,304 North American-made carsand trucks in the July 21-31 period, down 10.4% from 455,913a year before. For all of July, sales of domestic andimported vehicles dropped 8.2% to 1,165,675 from 1,220,358.   Imported cars sold at an annual rate of 2.2 million inJuly, down from 2.4 million last July. That doesn't includesales of Japanese-brand cars made in the U.S., which are partof the domestic sales figure.   Among the Big Three U.S. auto makers, only GM managed toincrease its share of the car market, to 38.2% from 36.6% ayear earlier. GM sold 431,695 cars and trucks during themonth, down 8% from a year earlier.   Chrysler Corp., meanwhile, saw its share of the passengercar market tumble to 6.2% from 8.2% a year earlier.Chrysler's struggling car lines barely outsold those ofNissan Motor Corp., which had a 6% share of the U.S. carmarket last month. A year earlier, Nissan's share was 4.8% toChrysler's 8.2%. However, Chrysler's truck sales, led by itsminivans, continued to outperform the overall market.   Ford Motor Co.'s share of the car market slid in July to19.6% from 20.6% a year earlier. Ford said it sold 265,961cars and trucks in July, a drop of 13% from a year earlier.The company recently sweetened the discounts offered onseveral car lines to try to spur sales.   Aggressive discounting helped Toyota Motor Corp. boost itsshare of the market by two percentage points to 9.9% in July.Its July sales were up 12% to 103,798.   Honda Motor Co., however, saw its share of the U.S. carmarket skid to 8.6% from 10% a year earlier.   Japanese auto makers selling cars in the U.S. saw theircombined share grow two percentage points to 31%. ButEuropean auto makers, struggling against declining sales forluxury automobiles, saw their U.S. share drop to 4% from 5%in July 1990.   ---               Percentage of Total U.S. Car Market                                                                                                                                 Jul       Jul       7 mos    7 mos Make                     1991      1990       1991     1990                                                                                                        General Motors-a ....... 38.2      36.6       36.2     36.1 Chrysler-a .............  6.2       8.2        8.3      8.8 Toyota-a ...............  9.9       7.9        8.7      8.0 Honda-a ................  8.6      10.0        9.4      9.1 Nissan-a ...............  6.0       4.8        4.9      4.7 Mazda-a ................  2.9       3.2        3.5      2.9 Hyundai ................  1.5       1.3        1.4      1.4 Mitsubishi-a ...........  1.9       1.2        2.1      1.9 Subaru-a ...............  1.4       1.3        1.3      1.1 Suzuki-a ...............  0.1       0.1        0.1      0.1 Other Imports ..........  3.8       4.7        4.2      4.9 Totl.
