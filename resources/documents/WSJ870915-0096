Government Securities Inc. case, according to court officials and Grant attorneys.    When reached, the settlement would bring the total payments by Chicago-based Grant Thornton to $160 million in the slew of lawsuits that have been filed against the firm by parties that lost money as a result of E.S.M.'s collapse in early 1985. Grant Thornton, the 10th-largest U.S. accounting firm, was formerly known as Alexander Grant andamp; Co. and was E.S.M.'s auditor.    The collapse of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based E.S.M. triggered a run on thrift institutions in Ohio and caused investment losses for 17 municipalities around the country that had done business with E.S.M.    Judge Richard Niehaus of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in Cincinnati said in an interview that $65 million of the $80 million in the proposed settlement would go to the Depositors Assistance Corp. Depositors Assistance is an Ohio state agency that was set up to pay depositors of Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank, which had $147 million in losses from investments it made with E.S.M. The rest would go to 69 Ohio thrifts that supported a private guarantee fund for thrift depositors.    Alvin M. Stein, a New York attorney representing Grant, said several points still must be ironed out with plaintiffs in Ohio before the final settlement is made. &quot;We're actively working toward a settlement and are hopeful it will be consummated soon,&quot; Mr. Stein said. &quot;This is the final leg in putting all the problems of E.S.M. behind us.&quot;    Jose L. Gomez, formerly Grant's managing partner for southern Florida, has admitted taking $200,000 in bribes from E.S.M. officials for certifying false financial statements. Mr. Gomez pleaded guilty to fraud charges early last year and was sentenced to prison last January.    The $160 million in completed and potential settlements &quot;is an unprecedented amount to be paid in a malpractice suit against any accounting firm and is the biggest black eye suffered by any CPA firm in history,&quot; says Arthur Bowman, editor of a monthly accounting newsletter published in Atlanta.    In Chicago, Burt K. Fischer, Grant's executive partner, said, &quot;We are delighted to be on the verge of clearing up the claims against us in the E.S.M. case.&quot; Mr. Fischer said Grant's $195 million in malpractice insurance coverage was &quot;more than adequate to cover the claims.&quot; Grant partners had to pay for a $500,000 deductible under a policy underwritten by a Lloyds of London syndicate and other insurers.    Mr. Fischer said Grant has been able to obtain continued liability insurance with a new deductible of more than $3 million. The lead insurer continues to be Lloyds, with several other European insurance companies providing added coverage, he said.    The initial claims against Grant involving E.S.M. totaled more than $250 million, and some attorneys close to accounting firms initially feared that the E.S.M. suits might sink Grant. But Mr. Fischer said Grant &quot;is doing extremely well and is in no danger of going out of business.&quot;    He noted that Grant has obtained a number of new clients over the past year, including Herman's Sporting Goods Inc., Snelling andamp; Snelling Inc., and Integon Life Insurance Co. &quot;It's true that we lost about a half-dozen clients because of the E.S.M. scandal, but we've been able to keep the vast majority of all our other clients while gaining new business,&quot; Mr. Fischer said.    In the wake of the E.S.M. case, Grant has shrunk, selling 12 of its 67 offices over the past year. As a result of these sales and of retirements, the number of Grant partners has fallen to 374 from 414 a year ago, Mr. Fischer said. However, he added that Grant's revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31 rose 8% to $210 million for its remaining 55 offices. &quot;Those partners who are left are thriving,&quot; he declared. Average income per partner, he said, is up more than 18% from a year ago.    As malpractice suits have mounted against accounting firms since 1980, some attorneys have called for limits or restraints on settlements, which they feel threaten the existence of professional firms. &quot;This settlement (by Grant) shows why it's so important that liability exposure be reduced in the courts or by state legislators,&quot; said Kenneth Bialkin, a senior partner of Willkie, Farr andamp; Gallagher, a law firm that represents the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the leading professional group for CPAs.    Since 1980, major accounting firms have paid out more than $300 million in out-of-court settlements to settle malpractice suits following the collapse of client firms to which the CPA firms had given clean audits. Two years ago, the eight largest U.S. accounting firms organized their own offshore captive insurance company after malpractice insurance rates for accountants more than doubled and coverage levels were sharply reduced by Lloyds and other major insurers.    Separately, in Houston, a federal court jury hit Coopers andamp; Lybrand with a verdict of $5 million after finding that the accounting firm had knowingly approved false financial statements of Rapada Corp., a former oil and gas company in Houston.    In the litigation, four purchasers of Rapada preferred stock, including a unit of Security Pacific Bank, had blamed Coopers andamp; Lybrand for certifying that the oil company had had a 1980 profit of $55,000 when it actually had a deficit of $2.4 million, and for certifying that the company had a positive net worth of $1.6 million when it actually had a negative net worth of about $1 million.    After a five-week trial, the jury found that the accounting firm &quot;acted knowingly with intent to defraud, or with severe, reckless disregard to the truth,&quot; in certifying the company's financial statements.    Lawyers for Coopers andamp; Lybrand didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.    ---   Thomas Petzinger Jr. contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
