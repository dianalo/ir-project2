In the inlet line to the wheel cylinder an      inlet valve is provided which affords a change-over from an orifice      function into a flow limiting valve function at a predetermined wheel      cylinder pressure. Flow is initially through an orifice (6) in a control      slide valve piston (20), held in its initial position by a prestressing      spring (23) acting through an auxiliary piston in engagement with control      slide valve piston (20). An increase in pressure in the wheel cylinder      (13), also exerted in the wheel cylinder pressure chamber (9), to a      predetermined level, causes the auxiliary piston (27) to disengage from      the control slide valve piston (20), preventing the force of the      prestressing spring (23) from acting on the control slide valve piston      (20). As a result, the control slide valve piston (20) is free to reach an      equilibrium position corresponding to the magnitude of the remaining      forces acting upon the piston (20 ). A control edge (33) on the piston      (20) establishes a flow-cross-sectional area (34) which, upon the filling      of the wheel cylinder (13), leads to a constant nominal flow rate within      the lines (19, 11, 12) to the wheel cylinder (13). </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  This invention is related to a brake pressure control apparatus for      automotive vehicles, with an anti-locking control system (ABS) and/or with      a traction slip control system (TSS), which is operated by fluid pressure.      Such apparatus includes a master cylinder, one or more wheel cylinders,      each for a corresponding wheel brake, a pressure modulator for the      modulation of the hydraulic pressure within the wheel cylinders during the      brake pressure control mode, at least one motor-driven pump for the      generation of a fluid pressure, and an electronic controller. </PAR><PAR>  An example of brake systems of this type is described in published but      unexamined German patent application No. 3,731,603. </PAR><PAR>  Brake systems of this type are equipped with an anti-locking control system      and/or with a traction slip control system. They are furnished with one or      with two auxiliary pumps which deliver fluid under pressure into a      pressure modulator during the anti-locking control mode to reincrease the      pressure in the wheel cylinders in the anti-lock control mode. </PAR><PAR>  The pressure modulator is comprised of a plurality of hydraulic valves. In      particular, inlet and outlet valves are provided in said pressure      modulator which are connected to the associated wheel cylinder. </PAR><PAR>  The driver stage of the electronic controller pilots said inlet and outlet      valves in accordance with the control algorithm which is installed in the      controller. A pressure reduction phase is generated in the wheel cylinder      when the outlet valve is open and the inlet valve is closed. When the      inlet valve is closed and the outlet valve is open, a pressure      stabilization phase comes about. When the inlet valve is open and the      outlet valve is closed, a pressure rebuilding-up phase commences. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, hydraulic circuits have been described in which the inlet      valve has a restrictive effect. See the German patent application No.      3,919,842.1. in this respect. </PAR><PAR>  In that patent application, a hydraulic brake system for a vehicle is      described which is equipped with an anti-locking control system and which      is comprised of a master cylinder, a fluid pressure accumulator, at least      one wheel brake which is in communication with the master brake cylinder      through a brake line and is in communication with the fluid pressure      accumulator through a return line. An electromagnetically actuated outlet      valve is inserted in the return line which shuts off the return line in      its normal position and releases the return line in its switching      position. A restriction valve is also incorporated in the brake line and      which is furnished with two switching positions, in a first switching      position, an unrestricted connection exists between the wheel brake and      the master brake cylinder, and in a second switching position, a      restricted connection exists between the wheel brake and the master brake      cylinder. </PAR><PAR>  A motor driven pump aspirates fluid from the accumulator and delivers it      through a pressure line to the restriction valve. A sensor monitors the      angular velocity of the wheel to be braked, and an electronic evaluation      unit evaluates the sensor signal and generates switching signals for the      pump drive and for the energization of the outlet valve. </PAR><PAR>  It is proposed in the aforementioned German patent application that the      restriction valve is connected by means of a control line to the outlet of      the pump so that the pressure at said outlet of the pump shifts the      restriction valve from the first into the second switching position. </PAR><PAR>  In the system described in the German patent application no. P 3919842.1, a      restrictor becomes effective in the inlet line going to the wheel cylinder      during the control mode. In the course of the control mode, pressurized      fluid is conveyed by the pumps into the wheel cylinder through the      aforementioned restrictor. A pressure rebuild-up in the wheel cylinder      comes about. </PAR><PAR>  The pressure reduction is attained by the opening of an outlet valve. The      outlet valves in question are constituted by electromagnetically      actuatable valves, closed when de-energized (NC valves). According to the      teachings of the state of the art, the NC valves are piloted by an output      signal of the electronic controller included in the anti-locking control      system. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  According to the present invention, the wheel cylinder pressure is utilized      so that the transmission of fluid into the wheel cylinder initially      follows an orifice function but is changed over by increasing wheel      cylinder pressure into a type of flow transmission which follows a flow      limiting function. </PAR><PAR>  In the inlet line going to the wheel cylinder, an inlet valve is provided      which is configured and positioned in such a manner that during the      pressure increase phase in the normal braking mode or during the pressure      reincrease phase in the anti-locking control mode, upon the filling of the      wheel cylinder, a flow limitation for the wheel cylinder takes place. </PAR><PAR>  In the disclosed preferred embodiment, the inlet valve is comprised of a      flow limiting valve assembly which becomes effective after a predetermined      wheel cylinder pressure has been reached. </PAR><PAR>  In particular, the inlet valve is comprised of an orifice through which the      wheel cylinder is being filled and of a flow limiting valve assembly which      becomes effective after a predetermined wheel cylinder pressure has been      reached. </PAR><PAR>  For the purpose of determining the change-over point on the curve of the      orifice function which denotes the beginning of the flow limiting      function, it is proposed that in addition to being subject to the action      of a control spring, a control slide valve included in the flow limiting      valve assembly is subjected to a prestressing force, preferably to the      action of a prestressing spring. </PAR><PAR>  The force of the prestressing spring is exerted by an auxiliary piston      protruding into a wheel cylinder chamber defined in the valve, so that the      prestressing spring is compressible by the wheel cylinder pressure exerted      on the auxiliary piston in such a manner that the influence of the      prestressing spring on the control slide valve is neutralized at a      predetermined wheel cylinder pressure. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment, the control slide valve is configured as a      control valve piston with a control edge, the piston separating a master      cylinder pump pressure chamber, on one side, which chamber is in      communication with the master cylinder, and with the delivery side of the      pump, and the wheel cylinder pressure chamber on the other side, which      chamber is in communication with the wheel cylinder. On one side, the      piston is subjected to the action of the pressure within the master      cylinder pump pressure chamber and, on the other side, is engaged by the      auxiliary piston to be subjected to the opposing forces exerted by the      prestressing spring, as well as a control spring acting directly on the      primary piston, and the pressure within the wheel cylinder pressure      chamber. Due to the rising pressure within the wheel cylinder pressure      chamber, the control valve piston assumes an equilibrium position in      which, with the aid of the control edge, a flow cross-sectional area in      the line going to the wheel cylinder is controllably adjusted, causing a      constant nominal flow rate to the wheel cylinder which is independent of      any pressure increases within the master cylinder pump pressure chamber. </PAR><PAR>  The invention has the following advantages: </PAR><PAR>  A rapid filling of the wheel cylinder is achieved during the pressure      increase in the normal braking mode as well as in the anti-locking control      mode. In addition, an exactly defined pressure gradient during the      pressure rebuilding-up phase in the control mode is attained. </PAR><PAR>  In particular, the functions of a flow limiting valve are achieved by the      invention and are utilized for a precise definition of the pressure      gradient. </PAR><PAR>  On the whole, a better adaptation to the volume accommodating curve of the      wheel circuit is possible. Within the framework of the dimensioning of the      flow limiting valve, an optimum exploitation of the pump characteristic is      attained. The pedal feeling is improved. </PAR><PAR>  A reduction of costs with regard to the set-up and to the manufacture of      the described brake pressure control apparatuses is achieved. </PAR><PAR>  The conventional prior art inlet valve consists of a solenoid valve, open      when de-energized, which requires a sophisticated and expensive electric      control system, numerous cables, a particular driver stage within the      electronic controller, is replaced by a lower cost apparatus. The overall      set-up of the brake pressure control apparatus according to the present      invention is of a simpler design than the prior art apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  The following advantages are attained by the invention: a rapid filling of      the wheel cylinder during the pressure increase in the normal braking mode      and in the anti-locking control mode is achieved. Subsequently, a      precisely defined pressure gradient is realized, in particular during the      pressure rebuilding-up phase in the control mode. In this conjunction, the      properties of a flow limiting valve are made use of. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, a better adaptation to the volume accommodating curve of the      wheel circuit and an optimum exploitation of the pump characteristic are      attained. </PAR><PAR>  The conventional prior-art inlet valve is solenoid operated, open when      de-energized, which requires a sophisticated and expensive electric      control system, a multitude of electrical cables, a particular driver      stage within the electronic controller, all of which is eliminated by the      invention. </PAR><PAR>  Further details of the invention, of the objects set and of the advantages      attained will be revealed by the following detailed description of the      preferred embodiment of the invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a plot of the volume conveyed into the wheel cylinder per unit of      time versus the pressure differential acting across the inlet valve. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a hydraulic circuit diagram of the preferred embodiment of the      invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring to the brake system represented diagrammatically in FIG. 2, in      the normal braking mode, hydraulic fluid under pressure is conveyed by the      brake pedal operated master cylinder 1 through the line 2 into the master      cylinder pump pressure chamber 3. </PAR><PAR>  In the anti-locking control mode, the pump 4 delivers hydraulic      pressurizing through the lines 5, 21, 22 into a master cylinder-pump      pressure chamber 3 defined on one side of a control valve piston in a      valve housing 39 of an inlet valve 37 controlling communication of the      pump 4 and master cylinder 1 with the wheel cylinder 13. The fluid      pressure accumulators 36 described above are installed on the inlet and      delivery side of the pump 4, with interposed check valves 38. </PAR><PAR>  The pressurized hydraulic fluid is conveyed via the inlet valve 37 placed      in communication with the master cylinder 1 and pump 4 by a fluid circuit      including line 22, and also with the wheel cylinder 13 via lines 10, 11,      12 included in the fluid circuit. </PAR><PAR>  The flow is directed through the cross-sectional area of an orifice 6      defined in a flow passage through a control valve piston 28 slidably      mounted in a housing 39 of the inlet valve 37, through a central passage 7      of the auxiliary piston 27 aligned with the orifice 6 from there through      the radial bores 8 into a wheel cylinder pressure chamber 9 defined in the      valve housing 39 by the other side of the control valve piston 20. </PAR><PAR>  From there, the pressurized hydraulic fluid is delivered out through      control port 34 into the lines 10, 11, 12 to the wheel cylinder 13      associated with a vehicle brake. </PAR><PAR>  The wheel cylinder 13 is thus filled with pressurized hydraulic fluid. As a      result, the pressure will increase within the wheel cylinder 13 according      to the section 14 of the curve in the diagram of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a diagram on whose abscissa 15 the values denoting the      differentials of the pressures within the master cylinder pump pressure      chamber 3, on one hand, and within the wheel cylinder pressure chamber 9,      on the other hand, are plotted. The ordinate 16 denotes the values of the      flow volume which is conveyed into the wheel cylinder 13 per unit of time. </PAR><PAR>  The section 14 of the curve described above is a part of the total curve 17      which graphically illustrates the orifice function. &quot;Orifice function&quot;      means that the flow volume per unit of time depends on or upon in      proportioned to differential pressure across the orifice. In this context      this is the differential of the pressures within the master cylinder pump      pressure chamber 3 and within the wheel cylinder pressure chamber 9. </PAR><PAR>  When the pressure differential has reached the predetermined value 18, a      flow limiting control will start. A constant volume per unit of time whose      value is indicated by reference numeral 19 on the ordinate will be      adjusted for the wheel cylinder by a flow limiting valve assembly which      will be described in more detail below. </PAR><PAR>  The described function operates both for the normal braking mode and for      the pressure rebuilding-up phase during the control mode. </PAR><PAR>  The master cylinder pressure will act on the control valve piston 20, in      the normal mode and then the combined master cylinder pressure and the      pressure of the pump 4 will be exerted thereon during the control mode,      when the pump 4 is put into operation. </PAR><PAR>  As has been explained above, the pump 4 delivers pressurized hydraulic      fluid through the lines 5, 21, 22 into the master cylinder-pump pressure      chamber 3. </PAR><PAR>  The pressure within the master cylinder pump pressure chamber 3 acting on      piston 20 is counteracted by the a collectively exerted thereon by a      prestressing spring 23, a control spring 24, and the wheel cylinder      pressure which builds up within the wheel cylinder pressure chamber 9. In      the pressure rebuilding-up phase of the control mode the outlet valve 2 is      in the closed condition. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 2, the prestressing spring 23 is accommodated within a      bore 42 in the housing 39 which is vented at 43 to be of atmospheric      pressure. The prestressing spring 23 is interposed between the bottom 29      of bore 42 in the housing 39 and a stop plate 30. The stop plate 30 is      rigidly coupled to an auxiliary piston 27. Auxiliary piston 27 has its      right end extending into the chamber bore 42 containing the prestressing      spring 23 with seal 28 preventing any escape of fluid from the wheel      cylinder pressure chamber 9 by flowing past the piston 27. When tapered      the left end 31 of the auxiliary piston 27 is engaged against the internal      tapered bottom surface 32 of the central valve piston 20, the force of the      prestressing spring 23, acting through the auxiliary piston 27, will      likewise act on the piston 20, urging it to the left as viewed in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  The control spring 24 is interposed in between a housing endwall 45      defining in part the master cylinder pressure chamber 9 and the tapered      bottom surface 32 of an internal bore 44 in the other side piston 20, so      as to constantly urge the piston 20 to the left. </PAR><PAR>  The differential pressure at the change-over point 26, (FIG. 1), depends on      the force of the prestressing spring 23. By means of the prestressing      spring 23, in addition to the control spring 24, the control valve piston      20, is maintained in its basic position. </PAR><PAR>  Increasing wheel cylinder pressure slides the piston 20 to the right which      thereby compresses the prestressing spring 23. </PAR><PAR>  When the pressure within the wheel cylinder pressure chamber 9 has reached      a pre-determined value, the auxiliary piston 27 and the stop plate 30 will      be moved to the right by the pressure acting on the cross-sectional area      of the piston 27. The auxiliary piston 27 will disengage from control      slide valve piston 20, to negate the effect of prestressing spring 23 on      the control slide valve piston 20 after the lefthand end 31 of the      auxiliary piston 27 lifts off the internal bottom surface 32 of the      internal bore in the control slide valve piston 20. </PAR><PAR>  The control slide valve piston 20 will now be movable to the right under      the influence of the fluid pressure in the master cylinder-pump pressure      chamber 3 to be capable of performing a flow limiting function, in      conjunction with the control spring 24, with the orifice 6, and with a      control edge 33 defined by the right side of the piston 20. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, increasing wheel cylinder pressure to a predetermined level      cancels or neutralizes the effect of the prestressing spring 23, allowing      rightward sliding movement of the control valve piston 20 so that the flow      limiting control mode is initiated. </PAR><PAR>  Due to the pressure within the master cylinder pump pressure chamber 3, the      piston control valve 20 will be slid to the right, into an equilibrium      position. As a result, the control edge 33 of said piston will enter the      range of the cross-sectional area of the port 34 of the line 10 leading to      the wheel cylinder 13. In the equilibrium position, the control edge 33      will establish a predetermined flow cross-sectional area which leads to a      constant flow rate of the pressurized fluid (nominal flow rate) directed      into the wheel cylinder 13. In the diagram the change-over point 26 is      reached in this situation on the curve 17. </PAR><PAR>  The nominal flow rate will not be affected by any further pressure      increases within the master cylinder-pump pressure chamber 3. The desired      nominal flow rate may be defined by a proper selection of design      parameters. In this way, a precise definition of the pressure increase      gradient is made possible. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 1, the constant flow rate is represented by the straight line 35. </PAR><PAR>  The described brake pressure control apparatus according to the present      invention allows an adaptation to the volume accommodating curve of the      wheel circuit which is better than that according to the state of the      prior art. </PAR><PAR>  A sequential arrangement of a plurality of orifices may be provided instead      of the flow limiting valve assembly. </PAR><PAR>  It will, furthermore, be possible to realize a mixed arrangement composed      of orifices and flow limiting valve assemblies in order to achieve a still      more elaborated and exact adaptation to the volume accommodating curve. </PAR><PAR>  During the pressure reduction phase within the frame-work of the control      mode, the outlet valve 25 will be opened. This will lead to a pressure      reduction within the wheel cylinder 13. A one way check valve 41 also      allows a rapid pressure reduction in wheel cylinder 13 after pressure      ceases to be applied by the master cylinder 1 and/or pump 4. </PAR><PAR>  The described embodiment shows a so-called &quot;closed&quot; system in which the      suction side of the pump is hydraulically connected to the outlet valve      without a fluid reservoir which is open to the atmosphere being arranged      in between. Basically, the invention, in particular the embodiment      described, may as well be employed for &quot;open&quot; systems. These are systems      which are comprised of a fluid reservoir which is open to the atmosphere. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
