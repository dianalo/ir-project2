It's a risky stock-picking strategy, but one that may beespecially worth looking into if the buyers snapping up theshares are also the ones running the company -- officers,directors and other &quot;insiders.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;From our standpoint, insider buying is a good indicationthat this {bad news} was a one-time situation,&quot; said RonRohe, chief operating officer of Baxter Financial Corp., aBoca Raton, Fla., money-management firm. &quot;While the Streetmay get surprised, there's a pretty strong pattern of thestock coming back after you see insiders buy.&quot;   So where are the insiders bullish despite bad news?   Consider four firms where Securities and ExchangeCommission filings show recent clusters of insiders buyingjust as Wall Street was selling: United TelecommunicationsInc., a Westwood, Kan., communications company, GranadaBioSciences Inc., a Houston biotechnology concern, DiamondShamrock Inc., a Houston oil refiner, and James Madison Ltd.,a Washington, D.C., bank-holding company. At three of thefour companies, the top purchaser was the chairman orpresident.   United Telecommunications, parent of US Sprint, reported a55% earnings plunge on July 17, triggering a 23% drop in theprice of its stock and prompting several shareholderlawsuits. But two days later, Chairman William Esreypurchased $138,150 of stock, SEC filings show. He bought5,000 shares at $27.63 a share, increasing his total holdingsby 6%.   Five other United Telecommunications insiders followed hislead with modest purchases later in the month, buying between250 and 2,000 shares. The purchases increased their totalholdings by between 18% and 190%, SEC filings show.   Mr. Esrey was out of the country and couldn't be reached.But Art Krause, the company's chief financial officer, summedup the insiders' view: &quot;We all feel that the market probablyoverreacted, and we're very bullish.&quot; Mr. Krause increasedhis own holdings in the company 31% with a 2,000-sharepurchase on July 20.   The United Telecommunications insiders paid between $24.63and $29.50 a share. In New York Stock Exchange tradingyesterday, the stock closed at $26, up 12 1/2 cents.   Similarly, four insiders at Diamond Shamrock bought sharesafter the company reported July 18 that its second-quarterearnings fell sharply. Net income skidded to 45 cents ashare, after write-downs, from $1.02 a year earlier, it said.   On July 23 and July 30, the company's chairman, Roger R.Hemminghaus, purchased 1,250 shares, SEC filings show. Hesaid he &quot;got them at bargain prices&quot; of $22 a share or less.That compares with the stock's $25 level as recently as June.   Mr. Hemminghaus said he also purchased 1,500 sharesearlier this month that he hasn't yet reported to the SEC. Intotal, the shares cost about $60,000 and brought his holdingsto 55,828 shares.   Much of the company's earnings drop, according to Mr.Hemminghaus, was due to a devaluation of its oil inventoriesin light of falling crude-oil prices at the time. But thevalue of those inventories could be raised this quarter, hesaid.   The three other insiders at Diamond Shamrock bought 500 or1,000 shares each, SEC filings show. All of them paid pricesranging from $20 to $22 a share. In New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading yesterday, Diamond Shamrock closed at$20.50, up 25 cents.   Granada BioSciences went public early this year. Insidershave been on a buying spree ever since, SEC filings show,even though the company has been losing money and its GranadaCorp. affiliate is embroiled in lawsuits. Altogether, sixinsiders have purchased 89,900 shares since January at pricesranging from $4.88 to $7, according to the filings. And, atleast on paper, they've all made money.   Darold McCalla, the company's president, has spent about$200,000 on Granada BioSciences stock. &quot;The initial offeringof the stock {at $7} was very close to its book value, so wethought there was value the Street hasn't recognized,&quot; hesaid.   Now, it &quot;looks like the Street agrees with us,&quot; addedKevin Gannon, the company's finance director, who haspurchased 26,700 shares this year. In American Stock Exchangetrading yesterday, Granada BioSciences closed at $10.25, down25 cents.   Granada BioSciences reported a second-quarter loss of 26cents a share, although that was an improvement over theyear-earlier loss of 73 cents a share. As for the lawsuits,nearly 300 investors have sued Granada Corp. in connectionwith 11 limited partnerships. Late last year, Granada Corp.rolled those partnerships into two publicly heldcorporations, one of which is Granada BioSciences. Thetransaction made the former limited partners the holders ofabout 45% of Granada BioSciences stock.   Mr. Gannon said Granada BioSciences has no liability forthe partnerships. Mr. McCalla declined comment on the suits.   Insiders have also been buying at James Madison, parent ofMadison National Bank.
