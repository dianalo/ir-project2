Meanwhile, the prospects for launches of fixed-coupon Eurodollar issues are mixed, bankers said.    While some said European demand remains good for better-known borrowers issuing debt with short maturities, it isn't clear how much demand there would be for such paper in Japan, where the bulk of available capital now resides.    Japanese investors, bankers noted, are nearing the end of the fiscal half-year and are preoccupied by substantial declines in their home financial markets.    Daiwa Europe Ltd., a unit of Daiwa Securities Co. in Japan, announced the latest repackaging of Japanese ex-warrant bonds, or bonds stripped of equity-purchase warrants and assembled for asset-swap purposes.    The issue, made through Jewel II Ltd., totaled $100 million of five-year floating rate notes. They were priced at 100.1 to pay 23 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than the six-month London Interbank Offering Rate, or Libor.    Meanwhile, a flooded Swiss franc bond market and rising rates in most international markets continued to curb prices on foreign bonds.    Prices fell 1/2 point, with some issues down 3/4 point. The decline extended almost three weeks of continually falling prices in Switzerland.    &quot;All the markets are falling apart,&quot; a Zurich trader said. &quot;Investors are no longer willing to take paper at any price.&quot;    Since the bear market in Swiss franc issues began, some prices have dropped three points, traders said.    Meanwhile, West German mark governent bonds fell almost one point, bringing yields to their highest level since July 1985, as the market reacted belatedly to Friday's rise in the U.S. discount and prime rates. Mark-denominated Eurobond prices also weakened.    The U.S. Federal Reserve surprised the market by raising the official discount rate 0.5% to 6%. The jump prompted banks to raise their prime lending rates to 8 3/4% from 8 1/4%.    In addition, the dollar continues to be weak in spite of the discount-rate increase, and that also disappointed market participants, traders said. </TEXT></DOC>
