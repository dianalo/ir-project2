Vulcan, a maker and distributor of plastic and steel shipping containers, has 9.5 million shares outstanding.    Vulcan and Ropak officials weren't available to discuss the offer, but Vulcan said in a news release that 50% of the total would be paid in cash and the remainder in convertible Ropak securities. Ropak is a Fullerton, Calif.-based maker of shipping containers.    Vulcan said it retained Burns Fry Ltd. to advise it on Ropak's offer and &quot;other options available to the company.&quot; Two Vulcan senior managers proposed last month to acquire Vulcan. The company said it has asked the two managers to take a leave of absence until a decision is reached.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Vulcan closed at 3.20 dollars, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
