The soldiers sprinted from a five-story hotel annex whenSalvadoran security forces outside assured them the rebels were nolonger in the area.   The Green Berets ran crouched, carrying M-16s with grenades ontheir belts to waiting police pickup trucks that sped off with them.   Reports in El Salvador varied on the number of soldiers had beentrapped overnight in the building, but a U.S. official inWashington said there were 12.   President Bush said today that a unit of U.S. Army's elite DeltaForce commandos was sent to El Salvador and ``liberated'' the hotelfrom rebels without a shot. But it appeared the rebels had left thehotel before the U.S. special operations force arrived.   The 12 soldiers inside the hotel, normally stationed with the7th Special Forces Group in Fort Bragg, N.C., had been in thecountry at the end of a two-week training mission, said a Bushadministration official. They were scheduled to return to theUnited States Tuesday, when the hotel was beseiged by the rebels,the official said on condition of anonymity.   Most of the from 15 to 20 leftist guerrillas in the hotelapparently slipped away during the night, the Green Berets said.   ``We watched them and could have shot them if we wanted to, butthat's not our job,'' said one of the Green Berets.   The raid on the hotel by the guerrillas Tuesday was their latestaction in an offensive against government troops that began Nov.11. At least 1,000 people have been killed in the offensive, thebiggest in the rebels' decade-old war against a succession ofU.S.-backed governments.   The Green Berets had been holed up near a stairwell on thefourth floor of the five-story ``VIP Tower'' while governmenttroops conducted a house-to-house search in the wealthy SanSalvador neighborhood of Escalon.   Three bodies were lying in one street, dozens of telephone poleswere toppled and thousands of bullet holes were in the hotel. Rifleshots rang out in the area until just 30 minutes before the GreenBerets left the hotel.   Reporters who went through the third and fifth floors of thehotel where the rebels were on Tuesday found none this morning. Thehotel is known as the El Salvador Sheraton, although it is nolonger part of the U.S.-based hotel chain.   Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas had seizedthe hotel annex Tuesday, trapping the Americans, civilian guestsand the secretary-general of the Organization of American States,who was on a peace mission.   Salvadoran soldiers surrounded the building, and OAS chief JoaoBaena Soares and the civilians were evacuated later Tuesday.   Col. Carlos Avilas, a Salvadoran military spokesman, claimedBaena Soares, who returned to Washington late Tuesday, was thetarget and said two of the diplomat's Salvadoran bodyguards hadbeen killed.   But it was not clear if the rebels had intended to seize theannex.   The group of fighters was not large enough to seize thesprawling hotel complex, and the rebels denied trying to kidnap theOAS chief. One of the trapped U.S. soldiers said the guerrillasappeared surprised and confused when they entered the annex.   The attack on the western neighborhood turned the area into abattle zone and stunned a war-weary city that had just begun toreturn to a semblance of normality.   The attack provoked a strong reaction from President Bush, whohinted that U.S. military force might be used to assist the trappedAmericans. The United States also has said it would expeditemilitary aid to the Salvadorans, and a large U.S. military cargojet was seen landing at the international airport at 5 p.m. Tuesday.   The men were not part of the group of 55 advisers stationed inEl Salvador, a number set by congressional limitation. Thecongressional stricture allows, however, for the transitional typeof training teams that the men were part of, the U.S. official inWashington said.   The United States also has provided $3.5 billion in aid to ElSalvador during the 10-year-old guerrilla insurgency, which hasclaimed the lives of more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
