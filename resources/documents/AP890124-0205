(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A poaching ring that involved theslaughter of more than 400 black bears in the Northeast was brokenTuesday with the arrests of 11 people, officials said.   Officials said the bears were killed for their gall bladders,which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the Far East.   ``This is just the tip of this particular iceberg,'' said WalterBickford, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Fisheries,Wildlife and Environmental Law Enforcement. ``We're aware ofnumerous other operations like this in Massachusetts.''   The arrests were made in raids that began at 6 a.m. inMassachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Florida, wildlifeofficials announced at a news conference.   The raids were the culmination of a 2{-year investigation that``tracked approximately $50,000 in transactions involving everythingfrom endangered species to black bear gall bladders,'' officialssaid. Game officials from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York andU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service participated in the sting.   Dozens of pelts, including those of a mountain lion and severalbobcats, and gall bladders confiscated in the raids were displayedat the news conference.   The officials also showed photographs of 27 bear carcasses piledin a meadow in the Catskills.   The hides sold illegally in the course of the investigationincluded those of two tigers, two polar bears and one arctic fox,officials said.   Bickford said investigators bought at least 360 gall bladders inaddition to carcasses and skins.   The arresting officers also confiscated boxes of pills that weresaid to contain small amounts of rhinoceros horn, also considered anaphrodisiac.   ``This is a primitive superstition,'' said Bickford. ``There isno proof whatsoever to the claim'' involving either the bear organsor rhinoceros horns, he said.   Dried, powdered black bear gall bladders have a greater streetvalue in the Far East than heroin or cocaine does in the UnitedStates, Bickford said. The organs can sell for $540 an ounce or more.   Three of the arrested suspects were from Massachusetts, threewere from Connecticut, four from New Hampshire and one was arrestedin Florida. Wildlife officials said more arrests were expected inNew York and an undetermined number of suspects in other states werestill at large.   The arrested suspects together face more than 100 counts in theirstates, ranging from illegal hunting to practicing taxidermy withouta license. Penalties for each count range up to one year in prisonand $1,000 in fines.</TEXT></DOC>
