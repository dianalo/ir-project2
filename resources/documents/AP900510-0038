A World Bank spokesman said Wednesday that the institution hasinsufficient resources to handle the millions of dollars needed forsuch a project.   ``The spirit of (former Interior Secretary) James Watt has beenreincarnated in the bodies of (White House chief of staff) JohnSununu and (budget director) Richard Darman, the Tweedledum andTweedledee of environmentalism in the 1990s,'' said Sen. JosephLieberman, D-Conn.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said, ``It is incredible to me thatthe Bush administration would be unwilling to come up with the verymodest sums involved in the transition fund.''   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., began circulating a letter to thepresident among colleagues asking for a meeting with theadministration on the decision.   The establishment of such a fund was to be proposed at anongoing CFC conference in Geneva, which U.S. representatives areattending, The Washington Post reported. The European-initiatedproposal wants money to help Third World countries convert toalternative chemicals and identify ways to replace CFCs, the Postsaid.   Such a fund would be administered by an international lendingauthority, such as the World Bank, according to the newspaper.   CFCs are used widely for refrigeration and aerosol products, aswell as some production. Scientists say CFC emissions aresdepleting the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmfulultraviolet rays.   The United States has signed a treaty calling for cutting CFCsin half by the end of the century.</TEXT></DOC>
