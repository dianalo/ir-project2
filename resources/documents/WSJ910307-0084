Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/07/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration met labor's toppriority legislation head-on, threatening to veto a bill thatwould bar employers from permanently replacing strikers.   Lynn Martin, the new Labor Secretary, said that ifCongress passes the measure, &quot;senior advisers would recommenda veto&quot; to Mr. Bush. Testifying yesterday before the Houselabor-management relations subcommittee, Mrs. Martin arguedthat the legislation would &quot;upset or destroy the delicatebalance of collective bargaining&quot; set by a 1938 Supreme Courtdecision and later expanded in 1983 and 1989 rulings.</LP><TEXT>   Rep. William Ford (D., Mich.), chairman of the full HouseLabor Committee, criticized Mrs. Martin's testimony, sayinghe &quot;hates&quot; disagreements in which one side says it won'tcompromise. The legislation is given good prospects forwinning House approval, but it faces tough going in theSenate. In addition, it is unlikely that either house wouldhave the necessary votes to override a veto.   The 1938 high court ruling affirmed the right of anemployer to permanently replace strikers, though they stillcan't legally be fired outright. This is a distinctionwithout a difference, unions argue, noting that union membershave lately lost jobs by being replaced in bitter strikesinvolving Eastern Airlines, Greyhound Corp. and the New YorkDaily News, among others.   For years, employers took little notice of the 1938 courtdecision. Today, however, union leaders contend thatemployers are increasingly threatening to permanently replaceworkers who strike, putting a damper on union efforts toorganize workers and negotiate contracts effectively.   Unions argue that this practice has severely underminedthe effectiveness of the strike weapon, which was authorizedby the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, because workersknow that they may permanently lose their jobs if they walkout. But many employers contend that workers should face theconsequences of possibly losing their jobs when they exercisethe right to strike, or else the strike weapon is too potent.   Mrs. Martin and other opponents of the bill cited a studyof 1985 and 1989 strikes by the congressional GeneralAccounting Office that found that only 3% to 4% of allstrikers were permanently replaced and that only half of theemployers who announced that they would hire permanentreplacements actually did so.   The bill's opponents said its language suggests that evenif nonunion workers leave their jobs to protest grievances,for instance, they couldn't be permanently replaced. But Rep.Pat Williams (D., Mont.), the subcommittee chairman,repeatedly insisted that the measure applies only to strikesby unionized workers.</TEXT></DOC>
