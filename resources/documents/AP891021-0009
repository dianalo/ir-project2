(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The traumatic rescue of a 6-year-old boyfrom the rubble of Tuesday's earthquake has become a focal point ofsympathy and good will from his classmates, his city and hispresident.   Julio Berumen lost his right leg after doctors had to cutthrough the body of his dead mother to free him from the family cartrapped in a freeway collapse.   The Richmond boy was in serious but stable condition Friday. His8-year-old sister, Cathy, was in fair condition with head injuriessuffered in the crash.   While the children's father, Pastor, waited for further wordabout his children, news of Tuesday's rescue had spread.   By Friday, Children's Hospital officials said there was evensome discussion about a presidential bedside visit.   President Bush did meet Friday with Dr. Jim Betts, who performedthe surgery on the boy while lying on his stomach on a board whichhad been pushed into a narrow opening in the wreckage.   The hospital had received hundreds of calls by Friday fromaround the country expressing support for the family. Peoplestopped at the front desk to bring toys. Some of them were in tears.   Hospital officials said the elder Berumen was aware of theattention his family had attracted, but wanted to stay out of thespotlight.   ``He's vey much in touch with this, but in his grief, he hasasked everyone to leave,'' said hospital spokesman Dennis Green.   Green said Berumen had been at the hospital almost constantlysince the accident and was being supported by relatives, friendsand hospital counselors.   The rescue, to many people, brought the earthquake very close tohome.   ``It really brings it (the earthquake) to a personal level,''said Antonieta Franco, Cathy's teacher. ``The whole family was veryclose. The mother was devoted to her children. She dropped them offat school and picked them up in the morning.''   Now, the mother was dead after being killed instantly when apillar on the freeway sliced through her car.   Cathy was pried from the car soon after rescuers reached it, butJulio was pinned. The mother lay between the rescuers and the boy.Doctors decided they had no choice but to saw through the seat andthe body to get to Julio.   Then came the decision to amputate the boy's leg.   ``I'd do it again,'' Betts said afterwards. ``I knew if I was upthere or one of my family members were up there, I'd want them todo it.''   The story of the rescue, which took more than four hours, hasstirred neighbors and friends who have organized two funds to helpthe family.   And the memory of it will serve as a reminder for many of thechildren's classmates long after the last aftershock fades.   ``It's going to be hard for the kids in my class to forget aboutit (the earthquake) after something like this.'' Ms. Franco said.</TEXT></DOC>
