WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Democratic Party announced plans Tuesdayto target statehouse elections in 18 states next year in the hopeof controlling state legislatures when congressional districts areredrawn for the 1990s.   The Democrats hope to raise $3 million to help candidates forthe legislatures in those states next year, said Tim Dickson, whoheads the party's Project 500 program.   The program's aim is to expand Democratic control of statelegislatures before they begin congressional and state legislativereapportionment in 1992.   Democrats are particularly concerned with states likely to gainor lose congressional districts as a result of population shiftsthat will come to light in the 1990 census. They are also focusingon states where the majority's grip in the state legislature istenuous.   ``We believe fair lines will be drawn, but we prefer to be theones drawing them,'' Dickson told a news conference. ``Since 1980,individual elections have been battles, but control ofredistricting is the war.''   The targeted states are Arizona, California, Colorado,Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, NewJersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia,Washington and Wisconsin.   Democrats now control 36 state Houses and 32 state Senates,while Republicans control 12 Houses and 17 Senates. They sharepower in Indiana's House; Nebraska has a nonpartisan bicamerallegislature.   Dickson said that the $3 million would be more than three timeswhat the national party spent toward state legislative races in1988, and that his group has raised $650,000 toward the goal.   The party will give money to Democratic legislative campaignorganizations in each of the states, which will decide how todivide it among individual candidates. Some of the money may go togubernatorial candidates, although the party has another fund forthose campaigns.   Of the targeted states, five are exected to gain congressionalseats because of population shifts: one or two seats in Arizona;five or six seats in California; three or four seats in Florida andTexas, and one seat in Virginia.   Six other states are expected to lose seats due toreapportionment, with New York projected to lose three seats andOhio and Pennsylvania each expected to lose two and possibly three.Illinois is projected to lose two seats, according to theDemocrats; Iowa, one seat, and Wisconsin, perhaps one.   The Republican National Committee also has a program to targetstate legislative races and governors' races. Leslie Goodman, aspokeswoman for the Republicans, said the party would not revealits spending plans or list its targeted states.   ``It makes no sense to lay out a political game plan,'' she said.   But, Goodman said, the Republicans will be focusing on stateswhere redistricting will mean a gain or loss of congressionalseats, and what she said were 14 states where Republicans arewithin striking distance of winning control of at least onelegislative chamber now held by the Democrats.   ``Ultimately we have to do better in redistricting than we didin '81,'' she said. ``We consistently get gerrymandered out of ourfair share. ... We're never going to have a shot if we don't getthe lines drawn fairly and properly.''</TEXT></DOC>
