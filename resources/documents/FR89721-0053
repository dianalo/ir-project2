TheDEIS has been distributed to various federal, state and local agencies,local elected officials, interest groups, the media and local libraries.A limited number of copies of the DEIS to fill single copy requests areavailable from the Commanding Officer, Pacific Division, Naval FacilitiesEngineering Command, Pearl Harbor, HI 96860. Public hearings to inform the public of the DEIS findings and to solicitcomments will be held on: <ITAG tagnum="10">16 August 1989 <ITAG tagnum="14">2:00 pm in the Governor's Conference Room, Saipan, CNMI,</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">16 August 1989 <ITAG tagnum="14">7:00 pm at the Garapan Elementary School, Saipan, CNMI,</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">17 August 1989 <ITAG tagnum="14">1:00 pm in the Mayor's Office, San Jose Village, Tinian, CNMI,</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">18 August 1989 <ITAG tagnum="14">2:00 pm in the Governor's Conference Room, Guam, Marianas Islands,</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">18 August 1989 <ITAG tagnum="14">7:00 pm in the Governor's Conference Room, Guam, Marianas Islands.</ITAG>These hearings will be conducted by the U.S. Navy. All interested partiesare invited and urged to be present or represented at these hearings. Thisincludes representatives of federal and non-federal agencies; commercial,business, and civic groups; ecological and environmental groups, fish andwildlife organizations; concerned citizens and other interested groups.All parties will be afforded full opportunity to express their views; however,in order to allow all present an opportunity to speak, statements willbe limited to five (5) minutes. If longer statements are to be presented,they should be delivered in writing either at the hearing or mailed tothe Commanding Officer, Pacific Division, Naval Facilities EngineeringCommand, and summarized at the public hearing. All written statements mustbe postmarked by September 5, 1989 to become part of the official record.Oral statements will be heard and transcribed by a stenographer, to assureaccuracy of the record all statements should be submitted in writing. Allstatements, both oral and written, will become part of the public recordon this study. Equal weight shall be given to both oral and written statements.The public hearings will be reported verbatim. Copies of the transcriptof the proceedings may be purchased at the cost of reproduction and willbe available three weeks from the date of the hearings. In addition, copiesof the transcript will be made available for public review during normalworking hours at Pacific Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command.As discussed in the DEIS, the Navy proposes to construct and operate upto three electronic installations, which are Relocatable Over-the-HorizonRadar (ROTHR) systems, on Tinian, Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands,and on Guam, Marianas Islands. Each installation would include antennatowers and arrays, ground screens and support facilities sited on eachisland. Transmitter facilities would be located on Tinian, receiver andoperational control center facilities would be located on Guam. The proposed installations would be constructed over a period of yearswith the first to be funded in FY 89. Construction of the other two ROTHRsystems would depend on Congressional approval and funding. Each ROTHRsystem is a stand-alone project and would operate independently. Collocationof the systems is not an operational necessity; however, collocation wouldpermit sharing of some facilities. Each transmitter would consist of 34 vertical antenna towers, includingthe sounder antenna, and 24 vertical support poles. Maximum height aboveground level would be 125 feet, total length of the antenna array wouldbe 265.5 feet. Each transmitter system could produce up to 200 kilowattsof power, which will be radiated only in the direction of its orientation.The antenna array and ground screen would be fenced with a wire fence onfour sides. The fenced area, called the radiation hazard area or exclusionfence area, would extend a maximum of 1,058 feet in front and 200 feetbehind the antenna array. The fence would be posted with signs warningof radiation hazard from the antenna array. Beyond this fence, there wouldbe no hazard from radio frequency radiation from the transmitter. The transmitterwould be operated by civilian contractor personnel on a 24-hours per day,7 days per week basis. No military personnel will be permanently locatedat the transmitter site. A total of approximately 62 civilian personnelwill be required to operate the three transmitters, if collocated. Each receiver would consist of 372 pairs of aluminum monopole antennas(a total of 744 poles), each about 18 feet tall and 6 inches in diameter.These pairs would be sited about 23 feet apart. Total length of the receiverantenna array would be about 8,600 feet; width of the receiver antennaarray would be about 800 feet. Each receiver would require an operationcontrol center consisting of operational vans, equipment shelters, andother support facilities. The receivers would be operated by military andcivilian contractor personnel on a 24-hours per day, 7-days-per-week basis.A total of 216 military and 69 civilian personnel would be required tooperate three receivers.Surveillance of critical areas is required to detect aircraft and shipscoming from eastern Asia. To meet this operational siting requirement,ROTHR systems must be sited in the Marianas Islands. In addition, technicalsiting requirements necessitate that the transmitter and receiver be separatedby 50 to 100 miles to permit their concurrent operation. A site of about100 acres is necessary for the transmitter and about 200 acres for thereceiver; however, the transmitter can be accommodated on a site of 58acres and the receiver on a site of 172 acres.Based on these two primary criteria, a number of islands were evaluatedfor development of ROTHR systems, including island combinations involvingGuam, Tinian, Rota, Saipan, and Anatahan. Saipan and Anatahan do not possesssufficient land areas for ROTHR development. The convenant between theU.S. Government and the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands requiresmilitary facilities be sited on the military lease area of Tinian, if atall possible, before considering acquisition of rights to use of otherareas. Thus, only sites on Guam and Tinian were considered.Other active and passive surveillance systems were considered prior toinitiation of development of the ROTHR system, including radar satellitesystems and aircraft surveillance. Current technology will not permit thedevelopment of a radar satellite which can be launched into stationaryorbit where it could continuously monitor areas of interest. Aircraft surveillancewould not provide the same coverage as the proposed ROTHR system; moreover,the land area required to base sufficient surveillance aircraft would bemuch greater than the area required for the proposed ROTHR systems.The DEIS provides a comprehensive analysis of primary issues identifiedduring the scoping process, including endangered or threatened species,air pollution, historic resources, and the effect of high frequency radiationgenerated by the transmitters on the environment and human health.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to designate portions of Guamas critical habitat for four species of endangered birds. The Navy wouldinitiate a Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceto minimize impacts to this habitat should proposed receiver sites on Guambe included in the critical habitat area.Transmitters would require continuous on-site generation of electricalpower. Calculations of controlled air pollution emissions indicate operationof all three transmitters would create sufficient pollutants to be considereda major stationary source according to CNMI Air Quality Regulations, thusrequiring a permit from the CNMI Department of Public Health and EnvironmentalServices.One transmitter and some support facilities would be located in the NorthField National Historic Landmark, which is listed on the National Registerof Historic Places. The Navy would initiate a Memorandum of Agreement withthe CNMI Historic Preservation Officer and the President's Advisory Councilon Historic Preservation to identify measures to protect this historicsite.A series of detailed studies evaluating hazards from radio frequency radiationwere prepared by the Navy. Results of these studies indicate no restrictionsof access outside the fenced exclusionary zone would be necessary.Questions regarding this notice may be directed to Mr. Gordon Ishikawaat (808) 471-3088.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Sandra M.
