The company last week asked the 14 unions representing railroad workers to begin informal negotiations to change certain work rules. Burlington Northern Vice Chairman Thomas O'Leary told an investment conference Wednesday the railroad could cut as many as 5,000 jobs, a figure a spokesman later called the &quot;middle range&quot; of possible layoffs.    The railroad holding company, which last year trimmed its railroad work force by 2,800 employees, or 7%, to 35,100, contends restrictive union work rules result in &quot;certain non-productive practices&quot; that could be eliminated. Formal negotiations over new contracts and work rules were scheduled to begin next April. </TEXT></DOC>
