Even though hiring for the holidays is as depressed as ayear ago, when the recession was just beginning, Saks FifthAvenue is experiencing an &quot;exceptional&quot; year for applicationsat its 49 stores, says Phil Johnson, a senior vice president.The flow of job-hungry applicants, strong last year, is evenstronger now. Saks' New York store got 1,200 applications inOctober alone.                                                                                                          Saks waits longer to start hiring; and, for the first timeever, it won't advertise for Christmas help. The Kmart storeon Detroit's Outer Drive gets 100 applications during thefour hours each week it takes them; normally it hires 50 to100 holiday workers, but this year it will add less than halfthat many. Michigan welfare cuts help spur a rash ofapplications at Detroit's Target store.   Plymouth (Mich.) Yard Hobbies is still waiting for aChristmas-related business surge expected three months ago;it will hire only one part-timer, instead of the usual two.                                                                                                          EMPLOYER CAUTION may increase under the civil-rights law.   Companies will study hiring, promotion and other practiceseven more carefully; they'll also give managers more rigoroustraining, says law firm Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler andKrupman. Jury trials and stiffer damages may spur moresettlements, a partner adds. &quot;You're going to weigh everykind of employment decision more carefully,&quot; says aconstruction-equipment firm lobbyist.   He predicts many firms will set hiring quotas to avoidcostly lawsuits. Fearing charges of reverse discrimination,Dominguez Services, a water utility in Long Beach, Calif.,may do less minority hiring &quot;since non-minorities could sue.&quot;But Rohr Industries and Polaroid see little change; they dosay they'll fight bias lawsuits vigorously.                                                                                                          KEEPING KEY WORKERS has high priority for many employers.   Reebok seeks to retain managers by offering them trainingin skills they need to excel. &quot;Even in a recession, there isno shortage of job opportunities for highly skilled people,&quot;a Reebok official says. Firms involved in buy-outs andreorganizations offer long-term contracts to keep topperformers, says Cleveland recruiter Jeffrey Christian.   US Travel, Rockville, Md., uses a staff psychologist todevelop programs to motivate salespeople; it establishes anew unit to do their paperwork, freeing them of thatdrudgery. To reward loyalty during times of cost-cutting,Poughkeepsie (N.Y.) Savings Bank Chairman Christoph Schmidtmay extend stock options to the best employees at all levels,not just to executives.   Genzyme Corp., a Massachusetts biotechnology firm, usescash rewards and stock options to keep scientists; losingthem &quot;can be a disaster,&quot; it says.                                                                                                          PAYING COLLEGE expenses for workers helps Carl's Jr., a600-restaurant chain, keep employees longer. In a two-yeartest at 43 California restaurants, the chain saved $145,128in turnover costs, while spending $90,000 on workers' tuitionand other education fees.                                                                                                          FASTING JANITORS: Church, labor and other groups will holda rally today backing a fast by Apple Computer janitors toprotest alleged &quot;poverty wages and unfair workingconditions.&quot; An Apple spokeswoman says the charges againstits janitorial-service contractor are unwarranted.                                                                                                          FULL PAY: A ruling by a federal judge in Louisiana couldboost employers' liability for violating the 1988plant-closings law about 40%. The court held that if therequired 60-day notice isn't given, workers must receive backpay for that many days -- including weekends, even thoughwages wouldn't have covered those days.                                                                                                          CRACKING DOWN: The Labor Department fined 14 mining firmsor their contractors $976,000 on charges involving deaths of16 miners. The penalties included eight $50,000 fines, thehighest levies allowed for mine-safety violations.                                                                                                          THE AIDS VIRUS in health workers is a very minor risk forpatients.   A report by the congressional Office of TechnologyAssessment agrees with the federal Centers for DiseaseControl that the danger an infected health-care worker wouldtransmit the human immunodeficiency virus to patients isextremely small. But analysis is too tricky to support ordisprove the CDC's estimate that 13 to 128 patients may havebeen infected during dental and surgical procedures in thepast 10 years, the OTA says.   The five patients infected by a Florida dentist are theonly known cases of HIV transmission to patients, excludingtransfusions, the OTA says. It agrees that mandatory testingof health-care workers isn't justified.   CDC guidelines for precautions are helpful, but some maydeter workers from seeking counseling or testing, the OTAsays.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Fully 80% of the 50 largest industrial firmshave women directors and 56% have minority directors, a pollby Boardroom Consultants shows. . . . Delbert Spurlock, aformer army assistant secretary, is confirmed as deputysecretary of labor; he is one of the Bush administration'shighest ranking black officials. . . . OSHA creates ahotline, 1-800-321-OSHA, for people to report risks of fire,explosion, toxic-chemical release and other workplacehazards.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
