Unix, which was invented by ATandamp;T, has become popular with othercomputer makers because it allows programs to run on a wide varietyof computers without alteration. However, the software hassplintered into many versions.   The Open Software Foundation confirmed Friday it plans to baseits new version of Unix on IBM's version, AIX, but ATandamp;T is tryingto get the group to change its plans and use the ATandamp;T version.   Skalko denied a report Friday which said ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E.Allen told securities analysts the Open Software Foundation hadagreed to use ATandamp;T's version.   Skalko said the report was apparently based on amisinterpretation of Allen's speech Thursday in Boston in which hesaid, ``We see the computer industry moving towards agreement onsome version of our own Unix operating system as an industrystandard.''   Allen only meant to assert that Unix was originally developed byATandamp;T, Skalko said.</TEXT></DOC>
