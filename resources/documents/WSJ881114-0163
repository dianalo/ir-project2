Exciting words in Hollywood, but they make traditional Japanese businessmen jittery. This is still a society where harmony, consensus and self-sacrifice for the sake of the group is highly prized. But if Japanese companies are going to innovate, say some senior Japanese executives, it can't be done without more risk takers, more individualists, more people who stand out, more stars.    In short, more American-style managers. So we have this ironic development: Even while some U.S. companies are sweating to learn Japanese management methods, a lot of Japanese companies are moving closer to the American way of doing things.    --At Asahi Glass, a very old-style company, 20 managers in their 30s have been singled out to launch new products on the leading edges of technology. Asahi calls it the &quot;star leadership&quot; program. &quot;We need a more enterprising mind,&quot; says Junjiro Tomozawa, senior managing director for personnel. &quot;Young minds have to be exposed to strategic thinking.&quot;    --At Chichibu Cement, chief executive Ken Moroi is busy diversifying into high-technology ceramics with a $70 million investment and an emphasis on management by meritocracy. &quot;In the past, we sacrificed the small number of talented people for the high morale of the mass.&quot; says Mr. Moroi. &quot;In the future we won't sacrifice. In the 1990s, we have to go more to the Western style of management.&quot;    --Many other companies are sitting at the feet of American managers trying to learn how to develop new ideas. In the large auditorium of Keidanren, Japan's most influential big-business group, American consultant David Nadler lectured for two days before a group of 100 Japanese middle managers, from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Sanwa Bank, Hitachi Shipbuilding, Mazda Motor and several smaller companies. One topic: How one man can make a difference.    None of this means Japanese industrial management will be transformed overnight. Change will come slowly, because Japanese society still has a strong tendency to hammer down any nail that sticks up. There may be growing Japanese self confidence in Japan, but there are relatively few Japanese entrepreneurs. There may be scads of money in Japan, but there is precious little venture capital.    Clearly, however, the more Western-style Japanese companies, such as Honda Motor, increasingly are in vogue. Honda, like other younger postwar companies, has long rewarded talent over longevity of service, brilliance as much as loyalty, and youthful vigor as much as age and experience.    Most of these new-style companies tolerate strong individuals, and not only at the very top -- people like Kozo Ohsone, a senior general manager of Sony Corp. The abundantly self-confident Mr. Ohsone won his spurs when he oversaw development of the Sony Walkman cassette player; after that he was instrumental in developing the compact-disc player. And more recently, Mr. Ohsone has doubled Sony's market share in miniature-stereo systems -- to 15% of a crowded market.    Consensus building has no place in Mr. Ohsone's scheme of things. He sets the goals himself and pushes the staff to meet them. He opened the stereo project with a demand for a $775 stereo system, no ifs ands or buts. He draws his staff from the traditional departments, but he won't let the turf-conscious department heads get in his way.    This kind of hard-charging management is creating more tension and animosity inside Japanese corporations, which, despite all the emphasis placed on harmony, are often hotbeds of factionalism and turf battles. Now, with top management beginning to award pay and promotions based on performance more than seniority, the stress is only increased.    At Asahi Glass, executive bonuses today are based on performance, a controversial idea. But Mr. Tomozawa, the top personnel executive, says, &quot;If we don't have change, we can't internationalize.&quot;    For top managers, too, the role change from bureaucrat to visionary is a stressful one. Popular magazines here have noted the large number of company chief executives who have died in office over the past two years, often attributing it to the trauma of internal change.    They have abundant reasons to be wary, for several Japanese top executives who attempted strong American-style leadership have already been sacked by their boards of directors. Last year, for instance, the autocratic president of Komatsu Ltd. lost his job by trying to impose too much, too fast, from the top.    At Komatsu, an old-line maker of construction equipment, Shoji Nogawa brought a decisive, strong-willed style of management -- and also paid a price for it. For years, Mr. Nogawa had become increasingly alarmed by Komatsu's stagnating sales and dwindling profits. He kept pushing for an American plant, but his subordinates kept stalling, paralyzed by the risks involved. &quot;They were talking and talking, and still no decision,&quot; says Mr. Nogawa. &quot;That's the problem with executives. They don't want to do anything.&quot; Eventually, the company built a plant in Tennessee.    But after five years of increasing conflict, Mr. Nogawa was summarily removed as president.    Although Mr. Nogawa's boss, Komatsu Chairman Ryoichi Kawai declined to be interviewed by this newspaper, he told a Japanese magazine interviewer, &quot;I know (Mr. Nogawa) is a smarter businessman than I am. But even so, he is overconfident of his own views and won't listen to others. Removing him was the only way to recover the company's original human relations and operations.&quot;    ---             Japan's Management Style for the 1990s   Highlights of a study done by the Keizai Doyukai, an organization of younger Japanese business leaders    Present Management Style        New Management Style                        Strategic Action    -- Development research         -- Basic research    -- Emphasis on efficiency       -- Emphasis on                                       innovation    -- Emphasis on principal        -- Diversification in        line of business               related fields of                                       business    -- Emphasis on operation        -- Emphasis on strategy                          Organization    -- Power base in                -- Power base in Randamp;D       production division             division    -- Large head office            -- Small head office    -- Bureaucratic structure       -- Innovative structure    -- Centralization of authority  -- Decentralization                                       of authority    -- Bottom-up-type decision      -- Top-management-led       making                          decision making    -- Class pyramid                -- Horizontal division-                                       of-labor network                            Practices    -- Lifetime employment          -- (Retain)    -- Seniority system             -- Meritocracy    -- Company labor union          -- (Retain, but redefine)    -- In-house training/education  -- (Retain)    -- Welfare of employees         -- (Retain)                         Human Resoures   --  Homogeneous personnel        -- Heterogeneous                                      personnel    -- Collectivism                 -- Tolerance of                                      individualism    -- Loyalty to company          -- (Retain)    -- Equality                     -- Individuality</TEXT></DOC>
