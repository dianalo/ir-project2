If you're a womanyou want an exception for Playboy. If you're a Jew you want anexception for Nazis marching. Pretty soon, you don't have a FirstAmendment.''   The president's call for an amendment on Tuesday was sparked bythe Supreme Court's ruling last week that burning the flag is aconstitutionally protected form of political protest.   Bush didn't say just how his proposed amendment would read, buthe did call the flag a ``unique symbol'' of America, suggesting hebelieves the Constitution can be amended to outlaw flag burningwithout unduly threatening the right to protest.   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, underlined that idea Wednesday,saying, ``The president does not believe this amendment would causean unraveling of the Constitution.''   Burton Yale Pines of the Heritage Foundation supported Bush,saying, ``This is no frivolous exercise, no slippery slope downwhich a host of democratic guarantees may slide. The amendingprocess would permit a national debate and referendum on the flag.''   But the ACLU's Glasser disagrees.   ``I think it's impossible to draft limiting language,'' he said.``Would it say flag burning or flag desecration? Would desecrationinclude wearing the flag, or superimposing a dove on it, or failingto salute it?''   Flag amendments already pending in Congress generally would givethe federal government and the states authority to prohibitdesecration of the flag and to impose criminal penalties for suchactions.   One introduced by Sen. Strom Thurmond, ranking Republican on theSenate Judiciary Committee, does not mention criminal penalties, butsays:   ``The Congress of the United States and the states have the powerto prohibit the desecrating, mutilating, defacing, defiling orburning of the flag of the United States.''   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the courts still would havea role in interpreting any amendment.   ``If the constitutional amendment is passed, it will obviouslyrequire some implementing legislation at both the federal and statelevel if the Congress and state legislators want to follow throughon it effectively, and the terms of that legislation would then besubject to construction in the courts,'' Thornburgh said.   Amending the Constitution is no easy matter. An amendmentbeginning in Congress must be approved by two-thirds of the Houseand Senate, and by 38 state legislatures.   Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who has represented the news media innumerous free-speech cases, said, ``Never before in our history havewe limited what the Supreme Court has held to be the First Amendmentrights of Americans.''   He said President Bush's call for a constitutional amendmentrepresents ``a dangerous precedent,'' adding, ``I believe a goodpart of the impetus for it is demagogic in nature.''   The constitutional right to burn the American flag, as seen bythe court, is not absolute. It does not protect those who burnsomeone else's flag, or those who while burning a flag trespass,disturb the peace or create a safety hazard.   Abrams said, ``The Constitution was drafted for the ages. There'sno way a flag-desecration amendment could be drafted for the ages.''</TEXT></DOC>
