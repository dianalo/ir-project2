Unprepared To Handle Soviet Exodus</HEAD><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Emigres from Soviet Armenia are flocking toSouthern California, and local officials are scrambling to meettheir needs.   Since October, about 2,000 Soviet Armenians have arrived in theLos Angeles area, and 8,000 to 10,000 more are expected by the endof the year, along with as many as 3,000 Armenians from Iran,according to the State Department.   ``The whole city's not ready for this,'' said Arick Gevorkian ofthe Glendale office of the Armenian National Committee.   ``Right now, we're organizing with the school district, with thechurches, trying to facilitate these newcomers,'' Gevorkian said.``But we are racing against time and we are not very ready.''   The influx began when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev launchedhis campaign of ``glasnost,'' or openness, and officials wereinstructed to approve exit visas for Armenians wanting to joinrelatives in America.   Officials say the influx is not related to recent turmoil inSoviet Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan.   ```Going to Hollywood, going to Hollywood.' You hear it all thetime on the streets of Yerevan,'' Armenia's capital, said HarryDiramarian, a local Armenian leader.   Southern California's Armenian-American population numbers inthe tens of thousands. Prominent Armenian-Americans include Gov.George Deukmejian and the late author William Saroyan of Fresno.   Worried officials said absorbing the newcomers probably will behampered by the nearly 50 percent cutback in federal refugeeassistance funding since 1984.   However, with the increasing numbers of emigres entering publicschools and applying for public assistance, welfare offices inHollywood and Glendale have added nearly a dozen Armenian-speakingemployees.   Glendale schools hired five additional Armenian-speakingteachers or aides to complement the eight already on staff. Moreare planned.   Officials said it's essential to provide such services early onor risk the refugees becoming permanently dependent on thegovernment.   ``Every public and private agency is understaffed, and it meansthat the Armenians are confronting delays in getting their mostbasic services,'' said Bruce Whipple, director of the local officeof the International Rescue Committee, a private agency thatassists refugees during their first 30 days of resettlement.   ``Right now, we have no job training or ESL (English as a SecondLanguage) slots to put Armenian refugees in,'' said Joan Pinchuk,Los Angeles County's coordinator for refugee affairs.   Last year, 3,250 Soviet Armenians emigrated to the UnitedStates, more than 13 times the number who came in 1986.   Armenian community leaders said these numbers reflect only afraction of the potential emigres who would like to move toSouthern California.   Terry Rusch of the State Department's Bureau for ImmigrantPrograms said the relaxation of emigration restrictions has beenextended to Soviet Jews, but not to the same degree as forArmenians.   Some Armenian-Americans are dismayed by the influx, arguing thata mass exodus from the Soviet Union weakens the only homeland theArmenians know, as well as their claim to Armenian lands in Turkey.   ``Every Armenian who leaves Armenia not only diminishes ourcollective power there, but is also risking the eventual loss ofhis or her national heritage and identity,'' said Harut Sassounian,editor of the California Courier, an Armenian-American weeklypublished in Glendale.   ``Unlike Soviet Jews, Soviet Armenians are not emigrating totheir homeland. Instead, they are leaving it.''</TEXT></DOC>
