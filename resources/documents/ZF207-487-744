 I know that may seem a bit of anoutrageous statement, particularly since many of you probably missed theannouncement of Fileshare last month and don't even know wbat I'm talkingabout.andP;  Take my word for it for just a second, while I explain wbat I mean.andM;Truly important software is software tbat not only responds to a distinct andunmet need, but also serves as a demonstration of the true value of newtechnologies.andP;  Wordstar, Visicalc, 1-2-3, Pagemaker, Hypercard are examplesof truly important software.andP;  It's a small and exclusive club.andP;  Filesharebelongs in tbat club because I think iVs the first network software that hasreal value for users that is also industrial strength.andP;  It's the kind ofsoftware that isn't just valuable if you happen to have a network installed,but that can actually provide enough value to motivate even timidorganizations to install new networks.andM;More importantly, Fileshare could well be the Visicalc or the Pagemaker ofMicrosoft Windows.andP;  Windows (and/or Presentation Manager) has had troublefinding its place in tbe personal computing world.andP;  So far, the primaryjustification for Windows is to run new-generation (read graphical) software.andO;But that software is frequently ported from the Macintosh to DOS machinesand, since Windows is tacked onto DOS and not integrated the way the Finderis integrated into the Macintosh operating system, tbe applications tend torun more slowly and less easily than the Macintosh originals.andP;  Consequently,Windows bas been something of a tough sell for DOS users.andP;  Since theMacintosh already exists and is well-supported by Apple Computer, it shouldfollow that Windows needs a new technology to justify its adoption by users(as with the bit-mapped graphics in tbe Macintosh) and an application toexpress tbat value in a way that users can understand its value (as withPagemaker and the Laserwriter).andP;  That new technology would seem to be localnetworking, something that DOS is very nearly incapable of dealing with andthat the Macintosh deals with in a journeyman fasbion.andP;  Until now, though,Windows software has tended to ignore the network.andP;  Fileshare cbanges thatsituation dramatically.andM;Fileshare is generalized software that helps groups of users share files(read documents) in an organized and useful but not intrusive fashion.andO;Fileshare is composed of an OS/2 LAN Manager server and a DOS Windows client.andO;The server keeps track of the location of files over multiple servers (in away that Saros says cannot be done on Netware 286 or 386), provides groupsecurity, and serves as a distributed database of information about the filesit is managing.andP;  It provides several tools and approacbes to help networkadministrators optimize use of their networks (by tracking the use of filesso that heavily used files can be spread around multiple servers, forinstance).andP;  Tbe client provides an interface for tbe user to check files inand out ofthe network, set parameters for files under the user's control, andfind out about the status of existing files.andP;  Since the client is anapplication, tbere is a clear separation between local disk storage andnetwork storage: the user can store files locally or in Fileshare's sharedworkspace and use an export/import feature to move them in and out ofFileshare.andP;  Within that workspace, users bave to consciously check files outin order to get access to them, at whicb point Fileshare begins keeping trackof modifications.andM;When you're dealing with a file in Fileshare, though, you're not just dealingwith an eight-character file name with a three character extension plusinformation about the creation date and size of tbe file.andP;  Instead, Filesharecan track up to 46 different attributes about a file, including file names(still limited to tbe 8.3 format), author, type of document, version number,modification dates, how many copies are checked out, and up to 20 customattributes.andP;  Theserver software keeps track of where files are, according torules set up by the network administrator, but the user can use any of the 46attributes plus an unlimited number of pre-assigned keywords to retrieveand/or manage files or versions of files.andM;The whole thing is very simple and yet very sophisticated, particularlybecause it doesn't require the user to understand tbe underlying principlesof either distributed file management or of multi-user access but it stillgives him extensive filemanagement features.andP;  It's the first software I'veseen anywhere (including those big Unix networks) that really improves tbefundamental notion for how computer users can deal with networks.andP;  If all ofthe whizzy stuff - distributed database management, universal localnetworking, distinct network applications - tbat the industry has beentalking about comes true, even users in small networks with 6-10 people aregoing to have to navigate hundreds or thousands of files stored in hundredsof megabytes of disks.andP;  And working your way up and down sub-directories justain't the way to be productive, when those directories might be four or fivelevels deep and hundreds of levels wide, Fileshare gives you a way to filterall the stuff you don't care about, to organize files that do matter to youlogically, and to sort through and control the growth in your files logicallyand intuitively, all without giving up any of your own software or local diskspace.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
