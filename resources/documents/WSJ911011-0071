In an episode of high drama, Judge Clarence Thomas, whowas only hours away from winning a lifetime seat on theSupreme Court, and Anita Hill, who says he made her a victimof sexual harassment, begin to tell their versions of thestory this morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee andan audience of millions.</LP><TEXT>   The proceedings will be carried live on ABC, NBC, CBS,CNN, public television and cable outlets. Heightening thetension were allegations from a second accuser, a formerThomas aide named Angela Wright, that he engaged in what shetermed &quot;annoying and obnoxious&quot; behavior, includingpressuring her for dates and making inappropriate comments.   Given the focused, explosive nature of the hearing, thisis destined to be one of the most dramatic days in Washingtonin recent memory.   In the narrowest sense, Judge Thomas and Ms. Hill arestaking their own reputations, personal credibility andcareers on this session. But they are also surrogates in afar larger struggle. The outcome of this hearing will affectthe personal and political reputations of lawmakers, interestgroups, President Bush and the White House politicalapparatus -- as well as informal and heated conversationsthroughout a riveted nation.   &quot;Right now the emotions are running higher than I canremember, with the best-laid plans being upset everywhere,&quot;says Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at theBrookings Institution. &quot;Washington and Congress are undersiege, and the whole world is watching. Clarence Thomas andAnita Hill are not the only public figures on trial.&quot;   The players in today's drama could pursue a number ofstrategies, each with enormous risks:                                                                                                          Clarence Thomas                                                                                                          Judge Thomas has to answer whether he dated, or tried todate, Ms. Hill. He also must answer whether he continued topress her despite repeated refusals. The nominee told Senatesupporters as late as Wednesday night that he never evenasked her out. But his affidavit denying her general chargesdoesn't answer that conclusively.   Judge Thomas also has to convince the lawmakers -- and thepublic, watching at home or offices -- that he did nothing togive the appearance that he was harassing her on sexualmatters or was using his position as her boss to create anatmosphere of discomfort.   He and his supporters must decide if he'll be morecredible if he gives an inch or stands firm. He could arguethat he may have said something improper and he's sorry; thathe did approach Ms. Hill socially but did not persist; orthat he simply never did anything that could even bemisunderstood. He'll probably take the last course, arguingthat he made neither social nor sexual advances to Ms. Hill,and certainly did not press upon her either his sexualinterests or accounts of pornographic materials.   He and the witnesses called to support him will portrayhim as a man with a formal business style and an almostprudish approach to work-place relationships. He will facethe hearings with the brand of confidence that left those hespoke to this week, in the words of William Kristol, VicePresident Quayle's chief of staff, &quot;absolutely convinced heis telling the truth.&quot;   The key to Judge Thomas's success or failure largely restswith him alone, says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, the onlyRepublican woman in the Senate and a probable Thomassupporter. &quot;Clarence Thomas has to personally address theseissues with a conviction and purposefulness that will resolvethese questions,&quot; she says.                                                                                                          Anita Hill                                                                                                          The University of Oklahoma law professor began this withconfidential allegations that Judge Thomas had subjected herto sexual harassment when she served as his personalassistant at the Education Department. How will she explainwhy she continued to work for Judge Thomas after thepurported incidents -- and especially why she followed him tothe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from theirprevious jobs?   &quot;If you listen to her carefully, no one can believe thatwoman is attempting to smear this man,&quot; says Roger Wilkins, aThomas opponent and former Johnson administration officialwho now teaches at Virginia's George Mason University. &quot;Sheis a very credible human being.&quot;   She has also been instantly transformed into a symbol bywomen's groups and liberal activists who wanted to defeatJudge Thomas's nomination long before these charges wereaired.   The witnesses Judge Thomas has summoned on his behalf willseek to pick her story apart, citing telephone log commentsindicating that Ms. Hill &quot;just called to say hello&quot; or &quot;needsyour advice on getting research grants&quot; or &quot;wanted tocongratulate on marriage.&quot; Ms. Hill will need to convincinglyexplain or refute those messages, as well as reports thathave Judge Thomas, for example, helping her land a job on thelaw faculty at Oral Roberts University.   And Ms. Hill will also be asked why she didn't broach hersexual-harassment charges in confirmation hearings forearlier posts that Judge Thomas won.   Ms. Hill will have to defend her own credibilityforcefully. But if she appears strident, she may play intothe hands of those who claim she's simply trying to derailthe nomination.                                                                                                          President Bush                                                                                                          The president who nominated Judge Thomas has to battle forhis nominee, of course, but how does he do that withoutwading into the underlying issue of sexual harassment?   Although the president has selected a record number ofwomen for appointive federal posts, none of his mostimportant political or policy advisers are women. Only two ofhis 14 most senior White House officials are women.   Some argue that Mr. Bush would do better to lose thebattle -- the nomination of Thomas -- than win the battle andlose a much bigger war. In his zeal to defend his nominee, healready has opened himself to criticism that he lackssufficient sensitivity to the difficulties women face in thework force.   Presidential advisers are counseling Mr. Bush to stay awayfrom the dispute over whether Judge Thomas is guilty of thecharges of sexual harassment. But Mr. Bush, who is preparingfor his re-election campaign, doesn't want to lose perhapsthe most emotional confirmation battle in decades. He iswalking a thin line.   &quot;One fairly obvious consequence is that he is going tohave to, in some way and at some point, acknowledge thisissue,&quot; says Ruth Mandel, professor at the Eagleton Instituteof Politics at Rutgers University. &quot;If he doesn't acknowledgeit and address it, it's going to come up in the 1992campaign.&quot;                                                                                                          Sen. Joseph Biden                                                                                                          The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Biden isbeing accused of not treating these charges seriously enough.The Delaware Democrat has to perform a tremendous high-wireact: On the one hand, he has to be sensitive enough to Ms.Hill to show that he cares about the issue of sexualharassment. On the other hand -- as the chairman of acommittee that began the downfall of Reagan Supreme Courtnominee Robert Bork -- he must be tough enough on Ms. Hill toshow that he's being fair to the nominee.   Mr. Biden knows that members of the committee have had, aspolitical scientist Robert Starks puts it, &quot;egg on theirfaces&quot; for days, answering charges about why they didn'tinvestigate further when they had at least some informationabout Ms. Hill's charges as early as July. The criticismcomes in the wake of continuing dissatisfaction with theconfirmation process from both sides of the ideologicaldivide, with each side accusing the other of politicizing theprocess.   Mr. Biden has told associates that he regards this episodeas a &quot;terribly ugly chapter on Capitol Hill,&quot; and will seekin the televised hearings that begin this morning to reclaimthe high ground for Congress. But how can he do that in thisatmosphere of recrimination? He also faces the likelihood ofa Republican-generated investigation of how Ms. Hill'scharges leaked to the public. (The committee, which haddeadlocked 7-7 on the nomination, won't take a new vote; theSenate vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)                                                                                                          The Democratic questioners                                                                                                          The Democrats will have to look as if they're trying toget the truth -- not as if they're trying to get JudgeThomas. It won't be easy.   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont is a former prosecutor whoseemed to have disbelieved much of what Judge Thomas said inhis hearings. He is already on record as criticizing thenominee for fleeing from his record, arguing that JudgeThomas &quot;jettisoned one public statement after another like acaptain trying to keep his ship afloat.&quot; Mr. Leahy hascomplained that Judge Thomas's advisers counseled him to&quot;play it safe,&quot; and that the tactic &quot;did not fulfill JudgeThomas's responsibility to the nation.&quot;   Sen. Howell Heflin, a former chief justice of the AlabamaSupreme Court, is a conservative Democrat who waffled on theThomas nomination and then opposed it, criticizing thenominee's evasiveness and suggesting he might be a right-wingideologue. His role in today's hearing is likely to be thatof the elder jurist; he might be regarded as something of abarometer for other southern Democrats.                                                                                                          The Republican questioners                                                                                                          They want to support Judge Thomas without appearing to bewinking at sexual harassment.   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who in the earlier hearingsassumed the role of Thomas defender, will be an energeticchampion. And though questions of sexual propriety weighheavily on Mr. Hatch, who has a reputation for beingstrait-laced, he can be expected to question Ms. Hillaggressively and to be an assertive advocate of Judge Thomas.   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, like Mr. Leahy aformer prosecutor, has already spoken to Judge Thomas aboutMs. Hill's charges. The nominee denied all the charges tohim; Sen. Specter will want to be sure that Judge Thomasdidn't lie to him. Aggressive and combative, Mr. Specter willfollow the story wherever it leads him, and Republicans knowthat he is not necessarily a GOP team player. He votedagainst Judge Bork but for David Souter, and supported JudgeThomas in the committee vote.   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the seniorcommittee member, is an administration hard-liner. He islikely to deplore sexual harassment but ask why Ms. Hillwaited to come forward.                                                                                                          The Thomas handlers                                                                                                          Although the White House is arguing that Judge Thomas ispreparing his defense himself, the team that prepped thenominee for his hearings is under enormous pressure to redeemitself and salvage the situation.   The handlers, led by corporate lobbyist and former WhiteHouse chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, calculated that theharassment report could be kept confidential, and didn'tpress Judiciary Chairman Biden either to dismiss theallegations or to deal with them. The group's strategy was toportray Judge Thomas as a person of extraordinary character,playing down questions of his experience and scholarship, andthey didn't anticipate an attack on what they regarded hisstrongest flank.   Moreover, the group's strategy of having Judge Thomas beas general and evasive as possible during the hearings --insisting at one point that he had no opinion on the SupremeCourt's landmark abortion ruling -- created a credibilityproblem that has haunted the nomination. Concerns about JudgeThomas's forthrightness cost him some votes he mightotherwise have won -- and left him more vulnerable when thesexual-harassment issue erupted. Now, the handlers are payingthe price.   &quot;The horrible problem here is that there is no way tohandle this,&quot; says a Republican familiar with the nominationprocess.                                                                                                          The anti-Thomas groups                                                                                                          For now at least, the activists who opposed Judge Thomas'sconfirmation are riding high, having already scored a victoryby delaying the nomination.   A number of liberal activist groups, especially theAlliance for Justice, People for the American Way and theLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, have emerged as thestealth bombers of confirmation hearings, working morefeverishly than even members of the Judiciary Committeestaff. These groups' influence first was felt during thenomination of William Rehnquist to be chief justice andintensified during the Bork confirmation fight, as theydeveloped into a tightly knit network.   &quot;The public wants to have the full record placed before itand the U.S. Senate,&quot; says Nan Aron, director of the Alliancefor Justice.   The groups and their supporters argue that they provideinvaluable research assistance and are a magnet forinformation about nominees. But opponents of theorganizations believe, in the words of Alan Slobodin,president and general counsel of the Washington LegalFoundation's legal studies division, that they &quot;will stop atnothing to defeat a nominee.&quot;   If the effort against Judge Thomas fizzles and theorganizations are seen to have grossly overreached, theircredibility will be badly damaged in any future battles.   Civil-rights groups that have opposed Judge Thomas are inan especially awkward position. On the one hand, says RonaldWalters, chairman of the political science department atHoward University, their objectives &quot;are going to be servedby this hearing because regardless of the outcome it's goingto damage the credibility of the nominee.&quot; But the groupscould also lose by winning: They know that if Judge Thomasperforms poorly today and is defeated, it is unlikely thepresident will nominate another black jurist.   ---   Jeffrey H.
