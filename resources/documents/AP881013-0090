The grave and what remained of the men's 17-foot fiberglassboat, the Sarah Joe, were found on Sibylla Island last month by aU.S. National Marine Fisheries worker and an archaeologist studyinggreen turtles and sea birds, Coast Guard Capt. Jim Cushman saidWednesday.   Two forensics experts and a 27-member Coast Guard shore groupwere sent to the island, located 2,054 nautical miles from Hawaii,after officials in Honolulu were notified late last month, Cushmansaid.   ``It (the grave) was located some yards above the high watermark,'' he said. ``It was a cairn of rocks with a crude cross ontop of it.''   The partial remains, comprising about 60 percent of a skeleton,including a lower jawbone, were found in the shallow grave, Cushmansaid. A skull was not recovered, he said.   A 2{-day search of the island, measuring about three miles byless than half a mile, and nearby islands turned up no other humanartifacts, Cushman said.   The island was described as uninhabitable, with no water orvegetation, he said.   The remains were transported last week to the Army's CentralIdentification Laboratory in Honolulu, where an attempt to make apositive identification will be made once medical records of thefive men are obtained, said Capt. Paul Bethke. It is possible theremains might not be associated with the Sarah Joe, he said.   The Sarah Joe was reported missing Feb. 11, 1979, after itfailed to return from a one-day fishing trip off Hana, Maui.   A search for the boat was suspended after five days following a56,000-square-mile search involving aircraft from the Coast Guard,Navy, Marine Corps, civil air patrol and commercial and privateaircraft.   Registration numbers on the boat's hull and the boat'smanufacturer's number were used to identify the Sarah Joe, saidCoast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.</TEXT></DOC>
