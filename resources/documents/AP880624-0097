In a separate report, Tass said guerrillas today fired rocketsin the Afghan capital, Kabul, and at a nearby hydroelectricstation. It also said Afghan government soldiers killed 265insurgents in battles in southeastern Zabul province.   Tass said the French advisers infiltrated Afghanistan in earlyMay along with a group of American, Chinese, Pakistani, Iranian andArab advisers. It did not give any names.   It said the group was organizing command posts, coordinatingattacks by anti-government forces, teaching guerrillas how to useground-to-ground missiles, and paying bonuses for successfulattacks.   Tass did not say when the French advisers were killed. Accordingto the report, the Afghan air force raided the command post of aguerrilla group in Zabul province and killed 40 rebels.   ``Two French advisers also were killed,'' the report said.   The report also accused the Pakistani military of deployinglong-range artillery and anti-aircraft guns capable of helpinganti-Marxist guerrillas, who have been fighting the Afghangovernment for 10 years.   Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 to help the Marxistgovernment. They began withdrawing May 15 under an accord signed inGeneva.   In a second report today, Tass said rebels fired four rocketsinto Kabul, injuring one woman and destroying a house. One of therockets caused a fire at the Kabul airport that was put out byairport workers, it said.   It said a man was killed Thursday when a bomb he was trying tosmuggle into the Kabul bazaar exploded prematurely. Two people wereinjured, the report said.
