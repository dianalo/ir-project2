Terms weren't disclosed.    Minstar, a leisure products and moving concern, said it will retain an equity interest in Bekins, a moving and storage operation. It didn't elaborate on the stake.    Minstar said it will use proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes.    Late last month, managers of Glendale, Calif.-based Bekins offered to buy Bekins. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    At that time, Bekins had about $65 million in net assets. Its revenue last year was $298.1 million, or 34% of Minstar's total revenue; Bekins's operating profit was $2 million, or about 1.4% of the parent's total.    Minstar officials couldn't be reached to elaborate on the transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
