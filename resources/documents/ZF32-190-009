 ProWrite Plus also offers a front end for electronic-mailsystems that are compatible with the Message Handling Service fromNovell/Action Technologies.andP;  You get all this for a list price of just $249.andO;Current users of ProWrite and OfficeWriter can upgrade for $65.andM;The best part about ProWrite Plus is its relative ease of use.andP;  Based on&quot;core code&quot; licensed from Samna Corp. and revised by Software Publishing, theprogram takes full advantage of the Microsoft Windows 3.0 interface,displaying a title bar at the top of the screen that allows easy mouse-accessto file, editing, and formatting options.andP;  A column of icons representingfrequently used commands, such as printing, storing, spell-checking, andundoing errors, runs down the left side of the screen.andP;  The program alsooffers shortcut keystrokes, such as Control-B to switch to boldface, forthose who still prefer a keyboard to a mouse.andM;Of course, the beauty of Windows-based applications is their graphic-handlingabilities.andP;  With ProWrite Plus, you can peruse various fonts and styles andsee the results immediately on the screen.andP;  If you're not sure what aparticular typeface will look like, most of the option boxes include a smallpreview screen that provides a quick sample before you change your text.andP;  Youcan switch between the software's draft and layout text modes with a singlekeystroke.andM;ProWrite Plus's most powerful feature is its ability to import and exportmany of the leading graphics and text file formats.andP;  It works with moreapplications than Microsoft Word for Windows does, including 1-2-3, MicrosoftExcel, dBase, First Publisher, WordPerfect, Ami Professional, and SoftwarePublishing's own Harvard Graphics.andP;  ProWrite Plus also supports Dynamic DataExchange (DDE), letting you import tables and images from other applicationsand ensure that the information gets updated automatically if the source datachanges.andM;The program's E-mail component is particularly impressive.andP;  When E-mail isused with a network that includes the Message Handling Service (MHS), aProWrite Plus user can send and receive notes, documents that includegraphics, and other attached files.andP;  You can also set up an &quot;address book&quot; tosend messages to people on other MHS hosts or gateways.andP;  When mail isreceived, an envelope icon appears in the left corner of the title bar.andP;  Theprogram checks for new messages every minute.andM;Using a mouse for word processing will probably be new for those accustomedto DOS-based applications.andP;  But even skeptics will soon see that a mousesimplifies many common writing tasks.andP;  To move a block of text, for example,you press and hold the mouse button at the beginning of the block, drag untilthe end, and release.andP;  Simply click the scissor icon to &quot;cut&quot; the text, movethe cursor to the new location, and &quot;paste&quot; the text into place with anotherclick.andM;Moving within a document is even easier.andP;  ProWrite Plus providesmouse-clickable buttons that instantly move text up or down a line at a time,a page at a time, or in other user-definable increments.andP;  If you make amistake, an undo option reverses up to the last four changes.andP;  If you needhelp, click at the top of the screen to look through the help index or, forcontext-sensitive help, press the F1 key whenever a dialogue box isdisplayed.andM;ProWrite Plus also offers an impressive variety of default settings-all ofthem easily changeable by mouse-including the generous ability to turn offthe program's colorful logo at the beginning of a session.andP;  Theword-processing program includes the Grammatik for Windows style and grammarchecker, though this feature is not as well integrated into the program asthe spelling checker or thesaurus; the program stores the document andessentially exists to Grammatik.andP;  Even though Grammatik is one of the bettergrammar analyzers around, it can only do so much to improve one's writing.andM;Naturally, I had a few quibbles with ProWrite Plus.andP;  You can't move a blockof text in a single step, but must first cut it, watch it disappear from thescreen, and paste it.andP;  Wathing valuable text disappear, even for a moment,can be unnerving.andP;  There's also no way to get a quick word count withoutgoing through a complete spell-check.andP;  The thesaurus includes a dictionary,but it suggests some odd synonyms, such as fancy for nightmare.andP;  In addition,any spelling checker ought to know the words fax and laptop.andM;Overall, though, ProWrite Plus is a rarity among the current crop ofWindows-based applications: It's a bargain.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
