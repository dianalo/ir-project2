The move marks the final leg of the system introduced in April for policing Britain's financial-services industry.    Under rules established by the Securities and Investments Board, U.K. investment businesses would share the burden for compensation claims, with a maximum limit of #100 million pounds ($172 million) payable by the industry in any single year ending March 31. An individual investor would be able to claim compensation of as much as #48,000.    David Walker, securities-board chairman, said the compensation plan marks a &quot;major breakthrough&quot; intended to sustain the confidence of the private investor in conducting investment business. The plan, to go into effect Aug. 27 and to be reviewed after 18 months, applies to both domestic and overseas business conducted in Britain by board-authorized investment companies.    The payment of compensation would be apportioned among the &quot;self regulatory organizations&quot; to which investment businesses are required to belong, with the greatest burden shouldered by the regulatory organization of which the defaulting business was a member. The plan will be administered by a separate body, which will have the power to levy payments on regulatory organizations. </TEXT></DOC>
