Takeshita today named a political outsider, former Supreme CourtJudge Masami Takatsuji, 78, to replace Justice Minister TakashiHasegawa.   Hasegawa announced he was stepping down just three days afterTakeshita appointed him to a new Cabinet supposedly untainted by astock-dealing scandal that had already forced the resignation of 17politicians and business leaders.   Opposition parties and analysts say Takeshita should follow thelead of those leaders and resign.   Hasegawa's resignation, which occurred the day after Takeshitapublicly reaffirmed his support for him, was the second Cabinetcasualty. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa stepped down on Dec. 9.   Takeshita made no comment on the resignation of Hasegawa, 76.   Takatsuji, a constitutional expert and former bureaucrat, servedas a Supreme Court justice from 1973 to 1980. He is an unusualchoice as a Cabinet member because he is not a career politician,the background of nearly all Cabinet ministers.   Takeshita apparently decided it was necessary to go outsidepolitics to find someone without links to the Recruit Co., theinformation conglomerate at the heart of the scandal over charges itsold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary to scores of politicians andbusiness leaders at bargain prices.   Asked at a news conference today if he had any connection to theRecruit affair, the new justice minister said: ``None at all.''   ``I don't really have anything to say about Recruit,'' Takatsujisaid. ``My attitude toward it is no different from that of thepeople in general.''   His predecessor had been given a mandate to reform politicalethics and head the legal probe of the Recruit scandal. But one dayafter Hasegawa's appointment, it was disclosed that Recruit hadgiven money for 12 years to a group that financed his campaign andpolitical activities.   ``There is nothing wrong with politicians accepting donationsmade from the good will of their supporters,'' Hasegawa toldreporters earlier today.   ``However, as minister in charge of clearing up the Recruitproblem in the Takeshita administration, which is trying to heightentrust in government, it is regrettable that I received donationsfrom Recruit,'' he said.   ``I apologize deeply and resign from my post as justiceminister.''   The scandal has engulfed the Liberal Democrats, as several seniorparty lawmakers or their aides purchased shares in the subsidiarybefore the shares were offered publicly and later sold them at largetax-free profits.   The transactions were legal but have generated a storm ofcontroversy over business and political ethics. Prosecutors also areinvesigating possible bribery.   Leaders of the opposition Clean Government Party and theDemocratic Socialist Party said Hasegawa's resignation was onlynatural, while the Communist Party called for the entire Cabinet toresign and new parliamentary elections.   ``Takeshita should step down because he is connected to theRecruit affair himself and as long as he is appointing Cabinetministers, government won't be clean,'' said Masayuki Fukuoka, aprofessor of political science at Komazawa University in Tokyo.   ``There is no way for the Takeshita administration to regain itspublic support as more people will probably be arrested as theRecruit investigation advances next year,'' he said.   It is widely perceived that the premier should consider resigningwhen public support dips below 20 percent, Fukuoka said.   A newspaper poll this month found Takeshita's public support was18 percent, down from 30 percent when he took office 13 months ago.   An aide to Takeshita and one of his relatives also profited inthe stock transactions, but the prime minister has denied anypersonal involvement.   ``Takeshita cannot escape the responsibility of political reformthat he has pledged, and he should resign,'' said Jiro Kamijima,professor of government at Tokyo's Rissho University.   ``The entire parliament has been hijacked (by Recruit).''   Hasegawa confirmed Thursday that his political supportorganization received $46,000 from Recruit over the last 12 years,but Hasegawa said he had no knowledge of the donations.   Other new Cabinet members have received donations from Recruit,including the agriculture and economic planning agency chiefs andChief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, who has acknowledged hispolitical support group received monthly donations of $160 fromRecruit.</TEXT></DOC>
