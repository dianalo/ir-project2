Starting today, the Securities and Exchange Commission will enforce strict rules standardizing the numbers that funds can cite in ads, particularly the yields touted by income funds.    &quot;These rules, like mileage ratings for cars, are intended to provide investors with a means to compare a variety of funds&quot; by using uniform standards, says the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group.    The changes should make it easier for mutual-fund investors to shop around. &quot;I look for quick ways of making comparisons,&quot; says investor John Brandon, a retired consulting executive in Worthington, Ohio. &quot;This gives me a standard by which I can make them.&quot;    Many investors, though, aren't yet aware of the details of the new advertising rules. The following questions and answers explain some of the changes.    How will the income-fund yields that I see in ads become more uniform?    Before the new rules, income funds could advertise just about any yield they wanted. Usually they'd quote whatever figure looked most attractive -- sometimes basing the yield on the most recent seven-day period, sometimes on longer periods if that would make the yield higher. Now, income funds must advertise their most recent, annualized 30-day yield, so that investors will know they're comparing apples with apples.    Will the new rules necessarily lower the yields that are advertised? -   Many funds will show lower numbers, such as Ginnie Mae funds, which invest in government-backed pools of mortgages. Under the new SEC formula, the Ginnie Mae funds will have to reduce their advertised yields by any losses realized from homeowners' early repayment of mortgages.    I've noticed there's often a discrepancy between the yield quotation and the check I get in the mail. What's the difference, and will this disparity occur under the new rules?    The advertised yield shows the comparative &quot;earning power&quot; of a fund. The check in the mail, however, is the distribution, or what's actually paid to holders. The disparity, which won't be affected by the new rules, arises because yields are based only on dividends and interest earned by a fund over a recent 30-day period. Distributions can include other income, such as short-term capital gains from the sale of securities or income from selling options on the fund's portfolio securities. Also, dividends may be based on a slightly different 30-day period than is used when the yield is calculated.    Will the way funds advertise total return also be affected?    Yes. Funds used to be able to quote total-return figures for just about any time period. Now those ads that ballyhoo total return must disclose the average annual total return for the past one, five and 10 years -- or for the life of the fund if it hasn't been around that long. Ads also must now say whether a sales fee is charged -- and must disclose the amount.    If both yield and total return are cited, which is more important?    For most investors, the more critical number is total return, which reflects the value of the securities in a fund's portfolio. Many bond-fund investors learned the hard way last year that as interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Even though some investors enjoyed seeing the higher yields, they found that it came at a price: Because of the drop in bond prices, the value of the fund was lower, and total return shrank.    As a result, some bond-fund investors who were getting, say, a 12% yield, actually ended the year with a negative total return. &quot;Total return is what your worth is, compared to what it was (when the investment is first made) -- no matter what the yield is,&quot; says William Lippman, senior vice president of Franklin Advisors Inc.    If I call my fund group to ask about a yield, will that number differ from what I see in an ad?    It depends on whether you speak to a human or a recorded message. The SEC recently ruled that starting Sept. 1, the yield standards for advertising will apply to the automated telephone systems that fund groups use to dispense yield data.    But the restrictions don't apply if a person -- rather than a recording machine -- provides the information. So when speaking to a broker or fund representative, it will still be important to ask how the yield is calculated.    What other changes can I expect to see under the new rules?    When ads contain performance information, they must point out that the quoted performance represents historical data and that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The SEC also is requiring that all information in print ads be no smaller than eight-point type size -- the same size as the letters in this article.    Under the new rules, is there any useful information that funds won't be required to include in ads?    Not much. As a result, the SEC changes likely will result in far fewer funds touting yield and total return performance -- partly because many yields will be lower, but also because less space will be available after all the required disclosures and explanations are listed. &quot;I expect to see fewer small-space performance ads,&quot; says John Saunders, a vice president at Fidelity Investments. </TEXT></DOC>
