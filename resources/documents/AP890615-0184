The officials said it was not clear whether the action takenagainst Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, 58, was part of an anti-corruptioncrackdown or because Cuban authorities questioned his reliability.   The officials, insisting on anonymity, said they were cautiousabout drawing conclusions because of the absence of hard information.   Ochoa is a veteran of Angola and Ethiopia and also served ascommander of Cuban forces in Nicaragua. According to RafaelFermoselle, a Cuban exile and an expert on the Cuban military, Ochoawas awarded the title ``Hero of the Revolution'' in 1984 and wascited by the Council of State for a variety of virtues, including``honesty'' and ``purity.''   The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces said in astatement Wednesday that Ochoa is being investigated for ``graveacts of corruption and dishonest use of economic resources.''   According to one account, Ochoa had engaged in illicit sales ofCuban sugar to Angola.   Gen. Rafael del Pino, the highest ranking military officer everto defect from Cuba, said he believes there was a relationshipbetween the arrest of Ochoa and the sacking of TransportationMinister Diocles Torralba the day before.   Del Pino said that Defense Minister Raul Castro, brother ofPresident Fidel Castro, had said in a speech Wednesday that many ofOchoa's subordinates were arrested as well.   Del Pino, who defected two years ago, said he believes that thearrests were based on a high-level of discontent within Ochoa'scommand which ``could have led to an uprising'' against PresidentFidel Castro.   He also said Torralba, during his military career, was one of the``most beloved and intelligent'' officers and had become ``the bestprepared and most intelligent personality in the Cuban government.''   The Council of State resolution, approved on Jan. 1, 1984, saidthat Ochoa ``carried out several internationalist missions withparticular spirit of sacrifice (and) brilliant performance ascommander of Cuban troops in Ethiopia.'' He also was praised for``his honesty, unselfishness, spirit of sacrifice, purity, desire toexcel and heroism.''   Del Pino seemed to agree with that assessment, saying that Ochoawas not a member of the ``corrupt elite'' in Cuba.   In a telephone conversation from Havana before this week'sarrests, Elizardo Sanchez, a human rights activist in Havana, saidthere has been a deterioration of the rights situation in Cuba inrecent weeks which reflects government uneasiness.   As an example, Sanchez cited the case of Roberto Bahamonde, anoutspoken dissident who was arrested and sentenced to a six-monthjail term last April for trying to organize a demonstration forvisiting Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.   Sanchez said that last Friday, Cuban authorities added a year toBahamonde's jail term for engaging in illegal economic activities.Bahamonde had been self-employed as a free lance photographer beforehis arrest.   Self-employment generally is illegal in Cuba but Sanchez said thethousands of Cubans flout that law in order to improve their livingstandards. He said the crackdown on Bahamonde could only beinterpreted as additional retaliation for his dissident activities.</TEXT></DOC>
