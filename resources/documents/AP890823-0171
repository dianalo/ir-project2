According to ANGOP, rebels killed 24 government soldiers andcivilians in clashes around the country, including attacks on therebels' former central Angolan stronghold of Huambo.   Government forces killed 17 rebels and captured several caches ofarms, said the report, monitored in Lisbon.   The news agency also reported the death of former Philippine airforce Lt. Col. Jesus Baldonado, who was working as a securityofficer at an Angolan diamond mine when he was kidnapped Aug. 12 byfighters of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence ofAngola.   The Manila Foreign Ministry also Wednesday confirmed Baldonado'sdeath.   U.S.-backed rebels led by Jonas Savimbi have not confirmed any ofthe clashes.   The reports came as Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santosreturned from a meeting on the Angolan peace process with sevenother African leaders in Harare, Zimbabwe.   They asked Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to revitalizeAngolan peace efforts that began failing immediately after dosSantos sealed a truce with Savimbi on Jun. 22 at an African summitin Gbadolite, Zaire.   An ensuing cease-fire lasted one week and government and rebelsrepeatedly exchange accusations of truce violations.   Last week, the rebels killed six Cubans fighting with Angolansoldiers and accused government forces of launching a large-scaleattack in southern Angola.   Mobutu has mediated sporadic negotiations between the two sidessince the cease-fire, but the fighting has escalated over the pasttwo weeks.   In Washington, the State Department said national reconciliationin Angola only can be achieved by direct negotiations between theguerrillas and government.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said they expectanother round of talks in Kinshasa shortly and have urged bothparties to progress on the central issue of how to achievereconciliation.   The guerrillas have been fighting for a share in government sincePortuguse colonizers hastily withdraw in 1975, leaving rival groupsto fight for power. The U.S. government gives the rebels between $15million and $18 million aid a year.   Under international peace accords signed last year, South Africapledged to end aid to the rebels and give independence to Angola'ssouthern neighbor, Namibia, in exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000Cuban troops fighting with Angolan government troops.</TEXT></DOC>
