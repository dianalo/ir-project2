While the increase in the Labor Department's Producer PriceIndex was double what economists had been expecting, most of themstressed that they saw no reason for worries that inflationarypressures are threatening to get out of hand.   The 0.4 percent October rise was down from a giant 0.9 percentSeptember increase and many economists predicted that the news oninflation will continue to improve in coming months as a slowingeconomy takes more pressure off prices.   For the first 10 months of this year, prices at the wholesalelevel have been rising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, comparedto an increase of 4 percent in 1988.   Stacy Kottman, an economist at Georgia State University, saidthat he looked for wholesale inflation to return to an annual rateof 4 percent in 1990.   ``Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable,we expect further moderation in prices,'' he said. ``We don't seeany reason for prices to vault upward.''   Virtually all of the price pressure last month came from a sharp1.4 percent jump in food costs, reflecting a 18.9 percent surge invegetable prices that analysts blamed on weather problems inCalifornia and Florida. Fruit, pork and fish prices also took ajump upward.   The overall food advance was the biggest since a 1.5 percentspike in January 1988, but analysts noted that food costs hadactually dropped in three of the previous four months. They calledthe October increase a temporary aberration and not a signal ofspiraling food costs ahead.   Energy costs, which had soared 6.5 percent in September,moderated in October, posting a modest 0.2 percent advance.Gasoline prices rose 2.3 percent but the cost of natural gas fell2.5 percent while home heating oil prices edged down 0.5 percent.   Wholesale prices, excluding energy and food costs, were up atiny 0.1 percent in October. Many analysts consider this figure abetter gauge of underlying inflationary pressures because both foodand energy prices are volatile from month to month.   New car prices fell by 1.4 percent in October as the new modelswere introduced, reflecting efforts by automakers to overcomesluggish demand by keeping a lid on price increases.   Economists said the October wholesale price report providedsupport for the decision this week by the Federal Reserve to lowerinterest rates in an effort to spur the economy.   While the Bush administration has been pressuring the centralbank to lower rates in order to keep the country out of arecession, the Fed had been resisting those moves because of fearsthat inflationary pressures were still too high.   But many private economists said they believed the Fed's ratereduction this week was appropriate given widespread evidence ofeconomic weakness, particularly in the U.S. manufacturing sector,and reports showing that inflation is moderating.   However, Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell saidThursday that he believed that inflation needs to be reducedfurther, calling the current rate of increase in consumer prices``too high.''   He called for consumer price increases to be shaved to the rangeof 3 percent, saying this goal would be acheived in the first halfof 1990. So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at anannual rate of 4.4 percent.   Analysts said that Angell's comments indicated that the Fed maybe prepared to wait awhile before following this week's interestrate cut with further reductions.   The Producer Price Index reflects the cost of goods one stopshort of retail. Before adjusting for normal seasonal variation,the PPI stood at 114.8 in October, meaning that a marketbasket ofgoods costing $100 in the base year of 1982 would have cost $114.80last month, up from $109.40 a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
