It is a reasonably simple matter to establish thetheoretical basis for estimating the error/uncertainty of flow measurement.It is quite another thing to implement the theoretical expression ina manner which reflects actual errors/uncertainties. This paper presentsthe theoretical procedure for estimating uncertainties and discussesthe relationship of these uncertainties to measurement error. In theprocess, it is necessary to establish some definitions associated withthis general theme as misconceptions abound with respect to terms suchas error, uncertainty, reproducability, repeatability, precision andaccuracy.</TEXT></DOC>
