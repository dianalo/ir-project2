In the firstserious bid to halt the deterioration, President Bush hasdecided to send a senior State Department official to China.   Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Robert M.Kimmitt's trip to Beijing next week -- which marks thehighest-level U.S. visit there since Tiananmen -- may go someway to satisfy China's demand for top-level consultation. Butadministration sources say the dialogue won't be easy.</LP><TEXT>   As the June 3 deadline for renewal of China's tradeprivileges nears, congressional critics, angry over a wholerange of Chinese policies -- including the use of prisonlabor and clandestine nuclear exports -- are drawing uplegislation to remove China's most-favored-nation (MFN)status. The administration, discouraged by the lack ofChinese response to its gestures in the past two years, hasmade only subtle attempts to protect trade relations.   The administration is concerned that cutting off MFNstatus could irreparably damage the ties and remove theremaining U.S. leverage over Beijing. &quot;Our relations withChina,&quot; a senior administration official said in aninterview, &quot;are teetering on the edge of falling apart.&quot;   In recent weeks, the administration even seemed to jointhe chorus against China. The U.S. Trade Representative'soffice last week announced that it has launched aninvestigation of China's software piracy under section 301 ofthe trade act. Earlier this month, Mr. Bush met with theexiled Tibetan religious leader, the Dalai Lama, despite therepeated warnings of the Chinese.   And just yesterday, President Bush denied licenses for theexport to China of U.S.-made satellite parts as a gesture ofconcern about the possible sale of Chinese missiles tocountries in unstable regions. White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said the president took the action because &quot;certainactivities&quot; of Chinese companies associated with the plannedlaunching of a Chinese satellite &quot;raise serious proliferationconcerns.&quot; The companies weren't identified.   Although the moves show a tougher stance on the part ofthe administration, they were partly designed to relievecongressional pressure for ending MFN status for China, thesenior official said.   The trade investigation comes in the wake of a long,fruitless effort by the U.S. to stop widespread softwarepiracy in China that costs U.S. companies an estimated $400million a year. The administration hopes to spur China intoadopting tougher copyright protection laws by holding up thethreat of punitive tariff.   Roger Sullivan, a former National Security Council stafferand director of the U.S.-China Business Council, says thatwith the investigation, the administration is trying tosoothe the anger of trade protectionists in Congress and thusdivide them from human-rights activists lined up againstBeijing.   Administration officials worry that they may be unable tohold back congressional action against China.   Administration sources say that President Bush is bitterthat he has little to show for his initial conciliatoryapproach to Beijing. &quot;They promised several times to resolvethe issue of Tiananmen prisoners,&quot; says a senior official.&quot;Each time, they have done a little bit but never resolvedit.&quot; Recently, Beijing announced there will be no moretrials. This, says the official, leaves by China's ownaccount 270 people in detention without trial.   Despite U.S. protest, Beijing has continued to jam Voiceof America broadcasts, though officials note that the city ofShanghai has stopped the practice. An additional irritant hasbeen a growing campaign in Beijing-controlled media in HongKong that paints the U.S. as an enemy of China bent onhegemony.   These irritants could have been ignored had the Chinesecooperated in other areas of U.S. concern, such as nuclearand missile proliferation. The administration was surprisedto discover in January that China for the past four years hassecretly helped Algeria build a nuclear reactor. U.S.officials say the reactor is too large for research and toosmall for power generation, thus raising suspicion about itspossible military use.   Another alarm bell rang in late March when Chinese ForeignMinister Qian Qichen announced that China wasn't a foundingmember of the 15-member Missile Technology Control Regime and&quot;should not be called upon to assume correspondingobligations.&quot;   The MTCR guidelines drawn up in 1987 prohibit sales ofmissiles capable of delivering a 1,100-pound payload 186miles. Experts such as Leonard Spector, a nonproliferationexpert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,point out that China's M-9 missile, with its 312-mile range,clearly violates MTCR limits, while the supposedly shorterrange of the M-11 missile -- barely six miles less than theMTCR limit -- is a doubtful virtue.   A senior administration official said that Mr. Qian'sstatement seemed to lend credence to reports about China'srenewed plan to sell missiles in violation of MTCR.Meanwhile, Asia Watch, an independent human-rights group,reported that China is &quot;systematically exploiting the laborof prisoners to produce cheap products for export.&quot; U.S. lawprohibits importation of prison-made goods.   In 1990, China's trade surplus with the U.S. rose by $4.2billion to $10.4 billion, making it the third-largest amongU.S. trade partners, after Japan and Taiwan. Data for thefirst two months of 1991 show that the surplus has continuedto grow.   ---   Eduardo Lachica contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
