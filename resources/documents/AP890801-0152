(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anguished relatives of hostage JosephCicippio reacted to his two-day reprieve Tuesday with caution andhope that his captors would free him after three years.   ``I am mentally and physically worn out and now we must endurethis for another two days,'' said David Cicippio, 27. ``We arebeing held hostage, just like my father,'' he said, waiting out thecrisis at his uncle Thomas' home.   David Cicippio, an electronics technician from North Wales, Pa.,voiced frustration with the latest ordeal, which was provoked bythe Israeli abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul KarimObeid, last week.   Cicippio's Shiite captors on Monday set an 11 a.m. EDT deadlineTuesday for Obeid's release, but more than two hours later, at 1:15p.m. EDT, the extremists announced a 48-hour extension.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization announced Cicippio'sreprieve in a 13-line handwritten statement in Arabic delivered tothe independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.   The threat came shortly after another group said Monday it hadhanged hostage Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in retaliation forObeid's abduction.   Cicippio's brother Thomas, who earlier Tuesday told reporters hewas ``depressed and nervous'' as the deadline approached, calledthe extension ``good news for all of us.''   ``When I got up this morning, I really didn't think there wasmuch of a chance we would get a reprieve,'' Cicippio said. ``Forthe next two days, we want to see what kind of movements takeplace.''   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-heldhostage, agreed that the extension could improve the situation.   ``I think the longer they talk, the longer they delay, thegreater the chances that we may turn this around and get them allhome,'' said Ms. Say in Nashville, Tenn.   Anderson, 41, was the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press when he was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.   Former hostage David Jacobsen said the Israeli action thatapparently led to the reported hanging of Higgins may have spoiledplans for Anderson's release.   Jacobsen, speaking from his Colorado home, said sources inLondon told him that Anderson was to be freed last Saturday by thenew Iranian government as a gesture of good will.   Joseph Cicippio, 58, was acting comptroller at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut when he was kidnapped from the campus Sept.12, 1986.   Among those gathered at Thomas Cicippio's home were JosephCicippio's sons David and Joseph Jr., 34, whose mother and Cicippioare divorced, and his brother Anthony.   ``It's time we took some kind of action. Who knows what kind ofthreats are going to be made in the next 48 hours? I have PresidentBush in my prayers and I pray that he makes the right choice,''David Cicippio said.   He was asked if he meant military action and the possibilitythat it would endanger his father's life.   ``If my father's life was taken, it would be for a worthycause,'' he said. ``I feel whatever it takes to get them homeshould be done. It would be a message: No more hostages should betaken.'''   Thomas Cicippio on Tuesday, however, repeated his opposition tothe use of military action to rescue his brother.   ``This has to be solved by diplomacy,'' Cicippio said.   While the Cicippio family waited in Norristown, JosephCicippio's current wife, Elham, tearfully pleaded with his captorsat a news conference in Beirut.   ``Please don't execute him, please,'' said Mrs. Cicippio, whoworks at the American Embassy in east Beirut.   She read a message to her husband: ``Joe, I know the difficultyof the situation in which we are but all I ask you is to keep yourhopes high.''</TEXT></DOC>
