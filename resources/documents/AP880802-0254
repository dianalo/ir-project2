Federal banking authorities closed the holding company's 40Texas banks after the close of business Friday and turned them overto Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB Corp.   Following that action, First RepublicBank Corp. and IFRB Corp.its wholly owned subsidiary and intermediate holding company formedin last year's merger with InterFirst Corp., on Saturday each fileda voluntary petition for Chapter 11 court protection from creditors.   First RepublicBank Corp. was left with a single bank in Delawareand certain subsidiaries engaged in non-banking activities,according to a prepared release issued Monday.   ``The bankruptcy filings by the holding companies do not affecttheir former banking operations in Texas,'' the statement said.``First Republic understands that such banking locations will openfor business today as banking offices of a newly chartered banknamed NCNB Texas National Bank.''   Formerly Texas' largest bank holding company, First RepublicBankCorp. was declared insolvent by the U.S. comptroller of thecurrency. Furthermore, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whichloaned First Republic $1 billion in March, called for repayment ofits note.   When the flagship bank could not meet the obligation,authorities took over the bank and its subsidiaries across thestate and the FDIC awarded them to NCNB.   The petitions, filed in a U.S. bankruptcy court for the NorthernDistrict of Texas, listed estimated assets of $535.7 million andliabilities of $788.2 million for First RepublicBank.   IFRB Corp. had estimated assets of $279.2 million andliabilities of $638.9 million, papers filed with the court said.   FirstRepublic Bank officials said estimated assets reflected inthe petitions ``may ultimately prove worthless, including certainintercompany accounts and sums receivable from former subsidiarybanks.''   Liabilities of the holding companies exclude liability to theFDIC for repayment of its $1 billion loan to some subsidiary banksbefore closure.   Other First RepublicBank subsidiaries _ First RepublicBankDelaware, Republic Money Orders Inc. and First RepublicBankServices Corp. _ will continue in business and serve customerswithout interruption, the statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
