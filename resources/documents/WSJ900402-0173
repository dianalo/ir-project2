Digital is touting features of its new workstations otherthan speed. Donald Gaubatz, group manager for workstations,said that DEC's new products will have better graphics thanIBM and will fit on a desktop, unlike most rival workstationsthat sit in consoles beside the desk.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, &quot;This announcement is less than one mightwant,&quot; said Peter Kastner, an analyst with Aberdeen Group,Boston.   The workstation market has been a game of corporateleapfrog in recent years as Digital, Sun Microsystems Inc.and Hewlett-Packard Co. surpassed each other in producing thelatest &quot;hot box.&quot; Digital's expected failure to top IBM showswhat a dramatic speed improvement IBM achieved when itre-entered the market. The scientists, engineers andprogrammers who use workstations demand fast machines to runcomplex software and display detailed graphics.   Digital has had a hard time in the market for fastworkstations that use reduced-instruction-set-computing, orRISC, architecture and the UNIX operating system. Most ofDigital's workstation sales are VAXstations that run itsproprietary operating system.   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that Digital's newworkstations will be based on Mips Computer Systems Inc.'sR-3000 microprocessor. He said that Digital engineers havecoaxed performance of 24 million instructions per second, orMIPS, an industry measure of performance. That far outspeedsDigital's Decstation 2100 workstation, which processes 14MIPS. But it falls short of IBM's new Powerstation 320, whichruns at 27 MIPS, and its more expensive Powerstation 530,which runs at 34.5 MIPS.   Analysts generally expect Digital to price its newestmodel at less than $20,000, depending on features. Mr.Gaubatz said the workstation will be competitively priced.   Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, said thathe thinks Digital's new workstation will run faster thanIBM's workstations in commercial applications, although itwill be slower for many scientific jobs involving heavycomputation.   Digital entered the RISC-workstation market early lastyear, breaking with tradition by buying a microprocessordesign from another company, Mips Computer, rather thanbuilding its own design. Digital's goal was to get into themarket fast. However, analysts say that its entries, theDECstation family, have gotten off to a slow start. TerryShannon, who follows Digital for International Data Corp.,Framingham, Mass., estimates that Digital sold only about6,000 of the DECstations last year compared with about 60,000VAXstations.   Domenic J. LaCava, Digital's vice president in charge ofworkstations, noted that the DECstation sales are &quot;allincremental business,&quot; that otherwise would have gone to UNIXcompetitors such as Sun Microsystems. But Digital's versionof UNIX is sufficiently different from others that many UNIXprograms have yet to be translated, or &quot;ported&quot; in industryjargon, to the DECstations. Digital is pushing developers toport their software.   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that, &quot;the first year was asignal that Digital was serious about the UNIX market. Thefeatures in the new product make up for all the shortfalls ofthe current model.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
