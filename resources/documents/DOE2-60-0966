While covered conductors have been shown to increasereliability and save space, there has been an inherent danger of burn-downduring thunder storms. In one particular system this problem has beeneliminated with suspension and tension clamps which function as arc protectors.Theoretical examination also suggests that covered overhead lines canbe protected with arc protectors placed on the pole structure when lightningstrikes the span of the line. Practical experience is in keeping withtheoretical analysis. On older unprotected lines the arc damage causedby thunder storms has always occurred at poles. The way in which thesystem's conductors are hung also protects them from damage caused bywind-borne vibration which occured in previous installations becauseof the susceptibility of covered conductors to vibration.</TEXT></DOC>
