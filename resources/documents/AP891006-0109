Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified for three hours in closedsession with the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees.   The two panels planned to issue later today a factual analysisof issues that remain in dispute surrounding the events in Panamaand contacts between the rebel officers who organized the coup andU.S. officials.   ``There are a lot of things in dispute'' said Armed ServicesCommittee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., referring to media and otheraccounts which he said are ``all over the lot.'' He declinedfurther comment.   But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Cheney and Powell ``basically... would not have changed their decision and recommendations tothe president, based on what they know today.''   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairmanand a leading critic of administration handling of the crisis, saidhe had not changed his mind following the briefing. He againcriticized what he called ``a flawed policy'' in Panama.   ``We're going to get to the bottom of this,'' Boren said inadvance of the hearing. ``I am convinced the full facts have notbeen laid out to us or the American people.''   Among the mysteries surrounding the coup, Boren said in aninterview, is exactly what was said in a conversation Tuesdayafternoon between two mid-level rebel officers and an Americanofficer, Army Gen. Marc Cisneros, at a U.S. military base in Panama.   It is clear, the senator said, that the rebels asked the UnitedStates to provide logistical support by blocking roads and bridgesthat might be used by troops loyal to Noriega to approach thePanamanian Defense Forces headquarters where the dictator was thenbeing held by the dissidents.   But whether they also offered to turn over Noriega to the UnitedStates remains unclear, he said, adding it appears that differingversions of the conversation were given to the National SecurityCouncil, the CIA and the State Department.   One version reports that the rebels said they were unable todeliver Noriega to the U.S. base, but would cooperate if a U.S.helicopter were sent to remove him. The other version portrayed therebels as refusing to turn the dictator over to the United States,saying they wanted him to retire and remain in Panama.   ``I want to see those cables and compare them,'' Boren said. ``Ithink they've got a lot of explaining to do.'' He said he mayschedule hearings and ``put some people under oath.''   Despite Cheney's efforts to explain administration actions anddetail the uncertainty that pervaded Tuesday's situation, membersof Congress in both parties continued to criticize.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the administration's storya ``weak-kneed explanation for failure'' and said the United Stateshad ``botched'' the handling of the coup. ``It's an incrediblestain on us,'' he said.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he doubtedadministration assertions that Noriega was left weakened by thecoup attempt. ``It seems to me that he is emerging from this,perhaps, unfortunately strengthened,'' Foley said.   Cheney, in a round of media interviews and in meetings withmembers of Congress, defended the administration's caution as theonly responsible course in the face of incomplete intelligence andsuspicions about the identities and motives of the rebels.   He said the coup leaders had made only general requests forsupport and called ``hogwash'' any suggestion that there was adirect appeal for the United States to snatch Noriega away.   But in a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,contended the requests for help had been more extensive and morespecific.   ``They told the U.S. officers that they were holding Noriegacaptive, and requested U.S. assistance to take custody of Noriegaand remove him to the United States,'' Helms alleged.   Boren said Helms' information, which came from staff inquiries,had ``some basis to it.''   Helms made his comments during debate on an admittedly symbolicamendment to a drug bill that underscored Bush's authority to usemilitary force to apprehend Noriega and bring him to justice ondrug charges.   The amendment was later killed, 74-25, after Sen. Robert Byrd,D-W.Va., termed it ``the officially sanctioned snatchingprovision.''   The Senate then adopted, 99-1, an alternative proposed by Sen.Sam Nunn, D-Ga., expressing support for Bush's efforts todemocratize Panama through a ``full range of economic, diplomaticand military options.'' Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., was the lonedissenter.</TEXT></DOC>
