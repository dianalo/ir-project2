The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus, the 11thnamed storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, had sustained windsof 60 mph and could grow into a hurricane by Friday.   Hurricane warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands along anarc from the French and Dutch island of St. Martin-St. Maarten inthe north to the British colony of Montserrat in the south.Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for Martinique and itssister island of Guadeloupe.   ``The storm has been showing signs of getting stronger, andwe're forecasting the possibility of it becoming a hurricane withinthe next 24 hours,'' said forecaster Miles Lawrence at thehurricane center.   Klaus was expected to pass near the sparsely populated island ofBarbuda late Thursday or early Friday, the center reported.   Tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when their maximumsustained winds reach 74 mph.   The hurricane center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches waspossible for the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. That couldtrigger flash flooding and mudslides.   Stan Cieniewicz, administrative officer for the Pan-CaribbeanDisaster Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, saidcommercial airlines were flying to the region as scheduled.   He said authorities in Guadeloupe warned residents to movecattle to protected areas, to avoid long road trips and to keepaway from rivers that could overflow in heavy rains.   At 6 p.m. EDT, Klaus was centered near latitude 17.0 north andlongitude 61.0 west, or about 55 miles east of Antigua. It wasmoving northwest at 6 mph, with tropical storm-force windsextending 115 miles from its center.   Earlier, Klaus dumped torrential rain on Martinique, a Frenchoverseas department of 336,000 inhabitants, where six people werereported drowned in floodwaters that reached nearly 10 feet inplaces. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes as raincontinued for a second day Thursday.   Among the dead were two sisters, aged 8 and 14, who were sweptfrom a bridge Wednesday in St. Joseph, authorities said. Rescuersfound their bodies Thursday.   Four men were drowned in different parts of the island. Theyincluded a 56-year-old farmer who fell from his tractor into aflooded ditch.   Two fishermen - a father and son - were reported missingThursday in Riviere Pilote. Officials told Radio CaribbeanInternational that the local outdoor market and soccer stadium wereunder 5{ feet of water.   Jocelyne Van Elverdinghe, an aide to Prefect Jean-Claude Roure,the French government's representative on the island, said floodingforced 750 people from their homes in Lamentin.   Schools were closed throughout the island. Flooding disruptedtelephone and electrical service.   In Barbados, southeast of Martinique, floodwaters forced theevacuation of a few families overnight and temporarily blocked someroads, although the major tourist hotels on the western coast wereunaffected.   Lightning knocked out electricity across the island Wednesdaynight.   High wind downed utility poles and trees in Dominica to thenorth.   Islands covered by hurricane warnings included St. Martin-St.Maarten, St. Barthelemy, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua and Barbuda,Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and St.Kitts-Nevis.   Many of the same islands were battered by Hurricane Hugo, whichdevastated the region in September 1989 before hitting the Carolinacoast.   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Josephine, with winds near 70 mph, wasreported at 6 p.m. to be drifting north at 8 mph in themid-Atlantic about 1,050 miles southwest of the Azores.   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
