The sales were legal and even were encouraged by the U.S.government. The extent of the sales demonstrates how hard itwill be for the Bush administration to prevent future exportsof so-called &quot;dual-use&quot; items -- those that can have eithercivilian or military applications -- to potentialadversaries. The administration is expected soon to presentnew regulations to tighten restrictions on such exports.</LP><TEXT>   In some cases involving Iraq, German companies such asGildemeister Projecta, the principal contractor on Iraq'snotorious Saad 16 weapons-research complex, obtained exportlicenses from the Commerce Department to ship American-madeequipment to Iraq. In other cases, U.S. companies obtainedthe licenses themselves to ship directly or throughintermediaries to such Iraqi agencies as the Ministry ofDefense, the Ministry of Trade and the Atomic EnergyCommission.   From the mid-1980s until Saddam Hussein's invasion ofKuwait, the Commerce Department approved more than 600licenses for shipments of $1.5 billion in equipment andtechnology to Iraq. They involved large concerns such asDigital Equipment Corp., which said it sold computer systemsto Iraqi &quot;universities and industrial destinations,&quot; andsmaller companies such as Jorway Corp., which providedelectronic equipment that could be used in nuclear physicsresearch to a company in Switzerland for shipment to theIraqi Atomic Energy Commission.   In addition, Presray Corp., Pawling, N.Y., sold rubberdoor seals to an Iraqi agency, State Electrical Industries.Such seals could be used in nuclear or chemical facilities toprevent the spread of contaminants, Presray said. VarianAssociates Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., defense contractor,sold an Iraqi government agency testing equipment that couldbe used to jam aircraft electronic systems.   Canberra Industries, a privately held concern in Meriden,Conn., said it sold environmental-monitoring equipment to theIraqi Atomic Energy Commission. It said that only one sale,for $25,000, required an export license.   All the companies said they complied with U.S. laws andhadn't intended to help the Iraqi military. &quot;We don't makeforeign policy,&quot; said Mark Frederickson, a Digital EquipmentCo. spokesman. He said Digital Equipment's Iraqi sales,directly or through a London company, totaled 12 shipments,each under $100,000. He said his company had decided not toaggressively pursue the Iraqi market.   Gary Milhollin, a Washington-based expert on Iraq'sweapons programs, says many sales of dual-use goods wereencouraged by the U.S. government. &quot;Many of the exports wereinfluenced by our tilt toward Iraq&quot; during its war with Iran,he explained. &quot;We wanted to make Iraq happy and U.S.policymakers committed a drastic mistake.&quot;   Defense analysts said German companies took the lead inhelping Iraq obtain equipment that could be used in chemical,missile and nuclear-weapons research. Gildemeister, forinstance, linked up with major U.S. and European companies toprovide computers, sensitive electronic measuring devices,and specialized photographic equipment, among other items,that were used in Saad 16. The complex, reportedly used forballistic missile and chemical research, was an early targetof allied bombing.   Gildemeister Projecta, a unit of Gildemeister AG, saidAmerican suppliers it used on the Saad 16 project includedEastman Kodak Co., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Tektronix Inc.   In March 1987, Gildemeister obtained a U.S. license tosell Saad 16 $290,000 in computerized microfilm equipmentmade by Kodak. Kodak said that it didn't believe theequipment would have any real military use, except possiblyfor storing information.   Gildemeister said the equipment delivered to Saad 16 was&quot;not specifically designed or made for military use.&quot; It saidit stopped all deliveries to Iraq in mid-1989 after Germanauthorities revoked the unit's export license and undertookan investigation.   Separately, a U.S. subsidiary of Siemens AG obtainedlicenses to sell Iraqi government agencies sophisticatedelectronic devices -- including $372,000 in communicationsswitching equipment. Siemens said the company has adoptedcomprehensive controls to ensure that it adheres strictly toexport-control laws.   Another German company, Carl Zeiss, sold Iraq's defenseministry computer mapping equipment. Leybold AG obtained alicense for a $572,000 laser system, which could be used bythe Iraqi military to repair jet engines and rocket cases,according to an American official.   Not all German companies that sought U.S. export licensesgot approval. Mannesmann Demag, a contractor andmanufacturer, sought to ship two Digital Equipment computersystems to an Iraqi government agency last February, but U.S.officials rejected the application because of DefenseDepartment concerns about its possible military uses.</TEXT></DOC>
