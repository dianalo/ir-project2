Continued firmness in product markets kept refiningmargins at profitable levels, encouraging high refinery runs. Gasolineproduction in the United States has been low this year, partly due torefinery maintenance problems and partly due to the requirement to extracthigher octane unleaded gasoline from crude oil. However, high refineryoutput of non-gasoline products is expected to result in early buildingof fuel oil stocks. In the United States, the composite refiner acquisitioncost of crude oil rose 41 cents in May to $16.22 per barrel, an increaseof 2.6 percent. Despite a slight increase in motor gasoline sales, thecontinued seasonal decline in fuel oil sales resulted in a reductionof 2.3 percent compared to April in total refiner sales of the top tenpetroleum products. 12 figs., 53 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
