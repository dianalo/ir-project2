Premier Miklos Nemeth, a Communist reformer and a key engineerof the nation's conversion to democracy, declared before he votedthat he was relinquishing control ``head high and with a clearconscience.''   A report by the official news agency said Nemeth won aparliamentary seat as an independent in a district northeast ofBudapest. But his party appeared to have done poorly elsewhere.   East Germany held Eastern Europe's first free elections indecades on March 18, and the Communists were rejected there.   In Hungary, they competed with 11 other national parties for 386parliament seats. No party held a clear lead in the early returns.   Despite occasional showers, voter turnout appeared heavy inBudapest. Few irregularities were reported by 8 p.m., when pollingstations closed. Several international observers had monitored theelection.   About 7.8 million people were eligible to vote and Janos Nemeth,chairman of the Elections Committee, said preliminary figuresshowed turnout was more than 70 percent.   Premier Nemeth, who voted at a state-run kindergarten serving asone of 11,000 polling stations across the nation, declined topredict the chances of his Socialist Party, which has governedsince reform-oriented Communists formed it after defecting fromtheir party in October.   ``The only thing I hope for is that a strong government iscreated,'' Nemeth said, adding that only a government not hamstrungby the opposition can deal with the nation's ailing economy.   His comments reflected widespread acceptance, even amongSocialists, that his party would not do well despite its role,unique in Eastern Europe, in steering Hungary to democratic reform.   Instead of crediting the Socialists for volunteering to play bydemocratic rules, most voters remember the excesses of more thanfour decades of one-party rule that have made Communists unpopularthroughout the Soviet bloc.   ``I won't consider it an act of God if I don't make it intogovernment,'' Nemeth told reporters. ``I will hand over the reinshead high and with a clear conscience. I don't have bitterness inmy heart but satisfaction.''   The state MTI news agency reported that Nemeth won aparliamentary seat in Szerencs, a village about 70 miles northeastof Budapest, where he ran as an independent.   With voters able to vote separately for candidates and parties,Nemeth had one of two chances of election, as an individualcandidate or as a nominee of his party on the Budapest regionalslate. He would be struck from the party list if he won in Szerencs.   Election results trickled in at election commission headquartersin the gothic Parliament building and at the election studio ofstate television.   Officials decided to stay with the familiar method of countingballots by hand and using computers only to cross-check the tally.   In East Germany, by contrast, trends were established soon afterpolls closed, with West German computer technology quicklydelivering results in a system typical of Western election coverage.   But Hungarian officials in most districts had tallied less than25 percent of the vote by early Monday, and final results were notexpected before late in the day.   The centrist Democratic Forum got the most votes in fourdistricts and led in nine more. The liberal League of FreeDemocrats got the most votes in one district and led in eightothers. The Independent Smallholders, a rural party, led in twodistricts and the Socialists led in two others.   However, no candidate or party gained the absolute majority inany of the districts where counting was complete, and all of thoseParliament seats were subject to a second round of voting.   Hungary's last elections were in 1947, when the Communists won arelative majority, largely through fraud. A year later, theyconsolidated power and forced all other parties out of existence.   Throughout the monthlong campaign, Socialist candidatesattempted to convince the electorate of their commitment to amultiparty system.   But pre-election opinion polls indicated the Socialists wouldfinish no higher than fourth place, with a maximum 10 percent ofthe overall vote.   A poll of 5,000 people published by the state MTI news agencyless than one hour before polls closed indicated the center-rightHungarian Democratic Forum would finish strongest, with 31 seats.The poll predicted the liberal Free Democrats would win 30 seats,the Independent Smallholders 22; the activist liberal League ofYoung Democrats 18, and the Socialists eight seats.   While proposing a variety of solutions on how to complete thetransformation from an ossified command economy to one obeying freemarket rules, most of the parties competing in some or all of the176 districts espouse centrist ideas.   Election rules call for a second round in case no single partywins an absolute majority Sunday and expectations were high thatscattered voter loyalties would force a runoff _ tentativelyscheduled for April 8.   Even new elections, however, were not expected to determine aclear winner, making a coalition government the most likelyscenario.   The Socialists were unlikely to play a role much beyond Sunday.Leading parties such as the Democratic Forum and the Free Democratshave repeatedly stated they would reject them as governmentpartners.   But Democratic Forum Chairman Jozsef Antall refused to commentSunday when asked by reporters about possible coalition partners.   Asked about his thoughts during balloting, Antall, a medicalhistorian, said: ``We want a free Hungary. And I'm happy that we'vecome this far.''   Free Democrat leader Janos Kis said he expected his party to beone of the top two finishers.   As he waited for a polling booth to become free, Kis explainedthe ballot to his school-age son.   Many of more than a dozen voters questioned at random expressedoptimism about the future. But some appeared to carry the scars ofthe past.   ``This is a great day in our country's history,'' declaredDemocratic Forum supporter Bela Kiraly, 50. ``I'm sure it marks anew beginning.''   His wife, Irene, also 50, said she voted for the DemocraticForum on the national list of candidates and for the Free Democratson the local slate ``because the more diversity in Parliament, thebetter.   ``If any one party becomes too strong, we might return to thesame situation we've had for 40 years,'' she said, referring topast Communist rule.   A 77-year old woman refused to give her name and preference, butsuggested she was sceptical that democracy had arrived to stay inHungary.   ``I've survived too many systems to tell anybody who I votefor,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
