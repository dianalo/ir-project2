The goal of thehot gas cleanup systems analysis effort at METC is to determine the interactionof novel cleanup processes on the remainder of these energy systems andidentify areas where further research could improve efficiency, reducecosts, or increase a processes chances for development and implementationby the commercial sector. These interactions are determined through engineeringanalyses conducted using a variety of tools including computerized processmodels, engineering calculations, and literature studies. The more significantaccomplishments achieved during fiscal year 1987 are discussed: assessmentof systems and economic issues for in-bed desulfurization in fixed-bedgasifiers; analysis of performance aspects of tail-gas treatment optionsin gasification island systems; determination of sulfuric acid industrycapacity and production; update of estimated zinc ferrite capital andoperating costs; assessment of existing zinc ferrite modeling tools;and determination of applicability of hot gas cleanup for methanol production.</TEXT></DOC>
