One key to the success of any such program is winning thecooperation of hospital employees, who often are ashamed to reportthey have been attacked by a patient, said David J. Drummond, apsychologist at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland,Ore.   ``There's a strong tendency among staff members to feel like`Gee, I must have done something wrong if this patient hit me,'''Drummond said in a telephone interview.   Drummond developed a violence-reduction program at the VeteransAdministration Medical Center and Outpatient Clinic in Portland andhis account was published in Friday's Journal of the AmericanMedical Association.   In his study of 36 patients, the number of reported violentincidents per visit fell more than 85 percent in the 12 monthsfollowing the program's implementation compared with the previous12 months.   An editorial in the same issue of the medical journal said thePortland program seemed to place staff safety ahead of patientrights, a charge that Drummond denied.   The program required staff members to report all patient threatsor violence against people or hospital property, as well assituations requiring police or hospital security.   The incidents ranged from verbal threats to armed hostage-taking.   Drummond said it took 2{ years for the hospital's BehavioralEmergency Committee to develop the reporting forms and to persuadestaffers to use them.   The committee identified 48 patients _ all men, with an averageage of 44.9 years _ as high risks for violent behavior and``flagged'' their computerized medical files to alert staffers oftheir potential for violence.   The flags consisted of brief messages such as, ``Patient shouldbe searched for weapons'' or ``Hospital police should be asked tostand by until released by examining clinician.''   ``Because of the flag, a nurse or physician now has the benefitof others' experience with the patient and may arrange forappropriate measures before walking into an examination room,''Drummond wrote.   ``What we find with many patients tending to be disruptive isthat if you get enough folks together in an examining area, you endup communicating a message to the patient that we are not going totolerate any acting out or disruption while we give you medicalcare,'' he said.   The study period ran from 1986 through 1987, with the flaggingprogram implemented at the beginning of 1987. Six of the 48subjects were excluded from the study because they were flagged forincidents that occurred before 1986 and did not visit the hospitalduring the study period. Six others were excluded because theirmedical records were not available for review, Drummond said.   The number of hospital visits by the remaining 36 subjectsdecreased 42.2 percent in 1987, to 147 from 254 in 1986. The numberof violent incidents fell by 91.6 percent, to four from 47.   Dr. Burr Eichelman of Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh, N.C.,took issue with the program, writing in an editorial that it wasunclear whether the program contained safeguards to preventhospital staff members from entering false information into apatient's file, or to prevent the release to law-enforcementagencies of confidential information about patient behavior.   ``We cannot take lightly the potential for abuses of patientrights in this computer age, even in the name of patient and staffsafety,'' Eichelman wrote.   Drummond said he was the only person authorized to flag patientsfor disruptive behavior and that the confidentiality of patientfiles was closely guarded.</TEXT></DOC>
