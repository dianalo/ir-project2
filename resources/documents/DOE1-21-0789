Based on results of the former researchthe first full-scale biogas plants were installed. Increasing energyprices caused growing interest of farmers and constructors. Within afew years about 25 biogas plants have been built on piggeries and dairyfarms. Only few digesters for animal waste have been installed lately.This stagnation in building biogas plants is due to technical problemsand non-technical influences. In the Netherlands high investment costs,low process efficiency and a moderate price level of current energy arethe bottlenecks. (Refs. 6).</TEXT></DOC>
