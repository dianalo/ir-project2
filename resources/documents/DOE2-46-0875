Norway is now a leading oil-producingcountry equal to Kuwait. 20 % of the total amount discovered, however,has already been used. To avoid a quick production drop, Norway's oilexploration strategy is beginning to focus on the Barents Sea. To stabilizeoil prices, Norway is cooperating with OPEC. In 1986, Norway bravelychanged its oil exploration/development tax system greatly. The SpitsbergenIslands in the northern part of the Barents Sea have a special positionspecified by the Spitsbergen Treaty. There, Soviet Union and Norway areexcavating coal and surveying oil resources. However, these island havebeen the subject of dispute between the two countries since twenty yearsago. Norwegian natural gas accounts for 13 % of the total world naturalgas exports. In any case, the oil or natural gas from the Norwegian continentalshelf is scarcely likely to flow into Japan, due to their high costsand prices. (3 figs, 2 photos)</TEXT></DOC>
