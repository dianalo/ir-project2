Or so it was for bond-fund investors in the first threemonths of 1991.</LP><TEXT>   High-yielding junk bond funds and convertible securitiesfunds, which crowded last year's list of weakest performers,surged to the top of the fund performance charts. At the sametime, last year's leaders became this year's laggards, as theresurgent dollar knocked global bond funds to the bottom ofthe quarterly rankings.   For the average bond fund, first-quarter returns were nonetoo shabby, especially compared with last year's dismalperformance. The average taxable bond fund gained 4.38% inthe first quarter, outpacing 1990's full-year gain of 4.26%.But the average for the past three months is a littledeceptive: While junk funds posted double-digit gains, mosttaxable bond funds returned less than 3%.   Junk funds, which last year suffered average losses of11.1%, bounced back to gain 14.11% in the first quarter,including both share-price gains and reinvested dividends.That makes them the best performing bond-fund category in thefirst quarter, according to Lipper Analytical Services, amutual fund research firm.   The junk bond rebound came during a quarter when concernsabout credit quality eased, but long-term interest rates werestagnant. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bondfinished the first quarter at 8.24%, unchanged from the endof December.   &quot;Over the last quarter, we went up and down a lot, but wedidn't make a lot of progress&quot; toward lower interest rates,notes David Capurro, a portfolio manager with FranklinResources. &quot;With the mortgage funds and the Treasury bondfunds, most of the gains came from income.&quot;   The biggest bond-fund returns during the first quartertended to go to the riskier funds. Junk bond funds, forinstance, outpaced high-grade corporate bond funds, and thecorporate bond funds, in their turn, outstripped thegovernment bond funds.   Not all the news was good. Money-market funds, which wereone of the few safe havens during last year's turbulent stockand bond markets, offered skimpy returns, as short-terminterest rates dropped sharply.   And global bond funds, which were last year'stop-performing bond-fund category, posted small losses duringthe quarter. The dollar, after falling for much of last year,started rebounding in February, and that cut the value of theforeign securities owned by global bond funds.   Investors tend to buy funds based on past performance,which means they are often loading up on a particular type offund just as the good times are ending. That again provedtrue with the global bond funds. They were last year'sbest-selling bond funds, pulling in $5.6 billion. Half ofthat money poured in during the last four months of 1990, andthe heavy inflows continued in January and February.   The junk bond rebound also caught investors flat-footed.Junk funds suffered net outflows of $5.1 billion last year,according to the Investment Company Institute, the mutualfund industry's trade group. Only recently, after junk bondshad already started rebounding, did money start flowing intojunk funds once again.   Junk bond managers warn that last quarter's 14% gain isunlikely to be repeated. But some reckon that junk funds arestill a decent investment.   &quot;The question is, are you getting compensated for takingthe credit risk?&quot; asks Joan Batchelder, manager of the $440million Massachusetts Financial High Income Trust. &quot;Theaverage high-yield bond is trading at 76 cents on the dollar,and yielding 7.5 percentage points more than Treasurys. We'vecome a long way, but there's still good value for thosewilling to assume credit risk.&quot;   Convertible bond funds also tore up the track in the firstquarter, returning an average of 12.84%. These funds buycorporate bonds that can be swapped for stock.   Most convertible bonds are issued by smaller companies,and until recently small-company stocks were miserableperformers. That, in turn, meant skimpy returns forconvertible bond investors. Over the five years throughDecember, convertible funds returned just 32.7%, comparedwith 41.7% for the average money fund. But this year,convertibles have been on fire, buoyed by the surge insmall-company stocks.   Convertible bonds are &quot;a chicken way to play the revivalof small stocks,&quot; says Edward Petner, manager of LincolnNational Convertible Securities Fund, a publicly-tradedmutual fund. Small stocks, he argues, &quot;have underperformedfor eight years, and there's no reason why this briefthree-month period of outperformance should come to an end.&quot;   ---                    Bond Fund Barometer                                                                                                                                                  ---------------- FUND                                       FIRST    TWELVE CATEGORY                                  QUARTER   MONTHS                                                                                                        High Current Yield                         14.11%    5.72% Convertible Securities                     12.84     5.82 Flexible Income                             5.55     8.97 Corporate Bond-BBB Rated                    2.95    11.34 Corporate Bond-A Rated                      2.90    11.34 Intermediate Taxable                        2.62    10.52 GNMA                                        2.44    12.48 Short Term Taxable                          2.25     9.69 Intermediate Municipals                     2.08     8.19 Short Term U.S. Gov't                       2.04    10.70 Insured Municipals                          2.02     8.53 General Municipals                          2.02     8.28 U.S. Government                             1.97    11.12 Intermediate U.S. Gov't                     1.85    10.87 Short Term Municipals                       1.85     7.19 High Yield Municipals                       1.80     6.63 Institutional Money Market                  1.69     7.88 Money Market Funds                          1.61     7.47 Inst.
