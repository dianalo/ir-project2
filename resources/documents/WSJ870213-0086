The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits deposit-taking banks from being &quot;principally engaged&quot; in underwriting &quot;ineligible securities,&quot; thus separating commercial banks and investment banks.    The idea behind this New Deal legislation was to protect depositors by restricting the kinds of investments banks could make with funds in demand accounts. Some bank regulation is necessary, but the notion that the Depression was caused by too little regulation is a myth. Brookings senior fellow Robert E. Litan wrote recently that &quot;there was no evidence that the securities underwriting practices were a significant cause of the collapse of the banking system or that certain highly publicized abusive underwriting practices were widespread.&quot; In our view, the Depression was caused by protectionism, but showed up first in the financial markets because they correctly anticipated political actions and their economic effect.    Whatever the original value of the commercial/investment bank distinction, the markets have eroded it. For one thing, no industry is more international than banking. U.S. banks' foreign competitors are not hobbled by Glass-Steagall. Commercial banks discovered that the only way they could get into new financial services was to get passports for their employees. London and Tokyo have become beehives of American bank subsidiaries underwriting corporate debt and making other investments denied them in the U.S. On the other foot, when Goldman Sachs went looking for an infusion of capital, it found a commercial bank that wasn't bound by Glass-Steagall -- Japan's Sumitomo.    The big irony is that restricting the investments that banks can make increases the risk to depositors. The very key to bank soundness is a diversified loan portfolio. Restricting thrift institutions to fixed-rate mortgages was a blunder only regulators could make. Ditto the farm credit system. Commercial banks haven't been able to diversify their portfolios into new instruments like mortgage-backed securities; instead, they're stuck with Third World debt. Commercial banks are especially troubled by being frozen out of the commercial-paper market. This short-term corporate debt is now a $300 billion market, up from $15 billion only 20 years ago. By issuing this paper, the big investment banks have eaten away at the commercial banks' best, least risky clients.    Only about one-third of all assets held by financial institutions are now held by commercial banks, down from more than half in 1946. Thrifts, insurance companies, pension funds and investment banks now hold the bulk of financial assets. Bankers have responded to this loss of business in a healthy way. They don't want protection, they want freedom to compete.    Congress has been the stumbling block. Despite the slogan of &quot;American competitiveness,&quot; Democratic Reps. Fernand St Germain and Charles Schumer have sandbagged all efforts to reconsider Glass-Steagall. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker has also begged Congress for years to take up the issue, even urging that commercial banks be allowed into all kinds of underwriting, including corporate. Wearying of congressional inaction, the banks have come knocking at Mr. Volcker's door.    Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust have applied to the Fed for permission to have their holding companies begin underwriting commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and municipal revenue bonds. Brokers at the big investment banks now perform the bulk of these activities. The three banks pledged in their applications that the new activities would not exceed 15% of the business of the holding campanies. While Mr. Volcker doesn't think the Fed has the power to undo Glass-Steagall on its own, the 15% limitation puts the Fed on the spot since this seems within the &quot;principally engaged&quot; test.    The problem is that there are a handful of issues that have to be resolved before the barriers for commercial banks can be lowered. Chief among these is the role of explicit FDIC guarantees, and implicit Fed guarantees to prevent a string of bank failures. Commercial banks obviously get a benefit from federal insurance, which they shouldn't use for gambling with risky investments. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has published a long paper trying to sort out what kind of regulation will have to remain.    While details have to be worked out, the markets have already made a big step toward deregulation almost inevitable. And as usual, the markets are right; more competition among financial institutions will cut costs and promote efficiency. The only question is how deregulation will come -- through the Fed, by inducing banks to exchange federal charters for state ones, or by exporting the banks to London. By far the best solution would be for Congress to get to work moving the laws into the modern age. </TEXT></DOC>
