Federal District Court Judge Robert Keeton ruled that&quot;liability for infringement&quot; of Lotus's copyright wasestablished by Lotus in the three-year-old case.</LP><TEXT>   Software copyrights have been a contentious issue in thesoftware industry since Lotus filed its suit againstPaperback, which is based in Berkeley, Calif. Paperback's VPPlanner program used different computer code than Lotus's1-2-3, but its commands and user interface -- the screens andkeystrokes that the user sees and uses -- were so similar asto violate Lotus's copyright, Judge Keeton ruled. He calledthe copying &quot;overwhelming and pervasive.&quot;   Judge Keeton's 113-page ruling was issued late yesterdayafternoon in Boston. The ruling isn't likely to have muchfinancial impact on Lotus, which analysts say has maintainedits dominant 60% market share despite competition fromclonemakers such as Paperback and other software companies.   However, &quot;it's going to be a long hot summer for thedefendants in all the pending software copyright suits,&quot; saidRobert Therrien, an analyst with PaineWebber.   Apple Computer Inc. is suing Microsoft Corp. andHewlett-Packard Inc. over alleged violations of its copyrighton the Macintosh computer interface. &quot;There's a strongprobability that Apple has a good case,&quot; Mr. Therrien said.   Many computer law experts had predicted that Lotus wouldwin the case, based on the growing body of software copyrightlaw. &quot;This is going to re-emphasize that screen displays arecopyrightable subject matter even if the underlying code isdifferent in the two products,&quot; said John Yates, an Atlantacomputer law specialist who represented DigitalCommunications Associates Inc., Alpharetta, Ga. in itssuccessful copyright-infringement suit against SoftkloneDistributing Corp.   Thomas Lemberg, Lotus's vice president and generalcounsel, said the ruling &quot;is definitive. It is a majorvictory and we feel very good about it.&quot; Henry Gutman,Lotus's outside counsel on the case, added, &quot;It's a veryimportant decision.&quot;   Mr. Lemberg said that Lotus expects to request aninjunction prohibiting Paperback from continuing to sell VPPlanner at a conference that Judge Keeton scheduled for July19. The issue of damages in the case had been reserved for aseparate phase of the trial.   Attorneys for Paperback couldn't be reached for comment.   In his ruling, Judge Keeton said that he didn't find theconcept of a copyright on &quot;look and feel&quot; of a program to be&quot;significantly helpful.&quot; Many software lawyers, frustrated bythe difficulties of defining what elements make a programcreative and innovative have used the phrase &quot;look and feel,&quot;which is borrowed from copyright decisions on music, playsand novels. He said he preferred the concept of a userinterface.   Judge Keeton said that some aspects of the user interfaceweren't evidence of copyright violation. For example, what hecalled the &quot;rotated `L' &quot; arrangement of headings for rowsand columns and the use of the slash key to start commands,aren't copyrightable he said.   However, he said that the menu of commands that a user caninvoke, such as copy, move, file &quot;is capable of beingexpressed in many . . . ways.&quot; He noted that otherspreadsheets, including Microsoft's Excel have very differentcommand menus. And he concluded that the menu is a keyelement of 1-2-3's user interface, which &quot;is the aspect thathas made 1-2-3 so popular.&quot;   In a separate development, Lotus shifted responsibilityfor some jobs among vice presidents and hired a new vicepresident from Apple Computer Inc.   Lotus named Donald P. Casey, Apple's vice president ofnetworking and engineering, as its new vice president of thespreadsheet division, in charge of its key revenue source.   The departure of Mr. Casey, however, is a blow to Apple,whose research and development organization is still reelingfrom the ouster early this year of Jean-Louis Gassee. Sincethen, John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer, has beenoverseeing the company's research and development activities.Mr. Casey directly reported to Mr. Sculley and recently washanded responsibility for producing new products for thecompany's Apple II family as well as networking products.   Mr. Casey, 44 years old, said that the Lotus job &quot;is agreat opportunity.&quot; He said he wasn't leaving Apple in adispute over strategy, but declined to comment on Apple'soutlook.   Mr. Casey succeeds Frank Ingari who becomes vice presidentof the new Emerging Markets Business Group, which will seekmarkets in the home and small businesses. June Rokoff, vicepresident of graphics products will become vice president ofa new group in charge of communications and informationservices, including its CD-Rom products. David Roux who hadheaded some of those operations becomes vice president ofbusiness development.</TEXT></DOC>
