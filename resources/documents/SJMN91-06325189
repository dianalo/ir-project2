Hisreturn signaled Gorbachev's renewed commitment to the sweeping political andeconomic reforms that Shevardnadze has long favored.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHEVARDNADZE REAPPOINTED TO FORMER POST  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mercury News wire services contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The appointment also reflected the Soviet Union's widening search forforeign economic assistance, as Shevardnadze's ministry will now deal witheconomic as well as political matters.;   Shevardnadze was appointed on a daythat saw the seven industrial democracies, alarmed at a possible Sovietdefault on debts, offer a one-year moratorium on debt repayment and $1 billionin new credits. The relief package was proposed after eight Soviet republicsagreed to be responsible for the debts incurred by the Soviet Union before thefailed August coup.;   At a meeting directly between republic leaders andfinance officials from the so-called Group of Seven, all the republics exceptthe Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Georgia agreed to shoulder their shareof the Kremlin's estimated $80 billion debt.;   The Ukrainian prime minister,Vitold Fokin, said that his republic would help pay for the debt but wantedsome precise figures before making a commitment.;   Commenting on the foreignminister's appointment, Alexander Likhotal, a presidential spokesman, said:&quot;Shevardnadze has very good relations with our primary partners abroad. Hisbecoming foreign minister again will increase these countries' faith in theSoviet Union.&quot;;   In Washington, President Bush praised the announcement, andState Department officials were openly jubilant. During his previous tenure,Shevardnadze forged unprecedented, close links with Secretary of State JamesBaker and his predecessor, George Shultz -- ties that culminated inU.S.-Soviet cooperation during the Persian Gulf crisis last year.;   &quot;We knowhim well and have great respect for him,&quot; Bush told reporters at the WhiteHouse. &quot;This is a matter for the Soviet Union to determine, but he has manyfriends in this country.&quot;;   Shevardnadze replaces Boris Pankin, who had beenforeign minister since August. Pankin goes to Britain as ambassador, replacingLeonid Zamyatin, who had backed the coup. Gorbachev is replacing theambassadors to France, the European Community and five other countries in apost-coup shake-up, the Soviet news agency Tass said.;   In a televisioninterview that was recorded before his appointment but was shown after theannouncement Tuesday evening, Shevardnadze said that the main danger theSoviet Union now faces stems from its own internal problems.;   &quot;New threatshave emerged that are no less serious, and maybe even more serious anddangerous,&quot; he said, dismissing as history the Cold War rivalry with theUnited States, the long confrontation between East and West in Europe and theconflict with China.;   Shevardnadze, who first became foreign minister in1985, returns to a much changed foreign ministry. It is now largely purged ofKGB agents and conservatives, cut by more than 30 percent under budgetcrunches and preparing to close perhaps as many as 30 embassies. Also, itsheadquarters staff merged with that of the foreign trade ministry and is nowresponsible to the Soviet Union's constituent republics, not just theKremlin.;   In a dramatic move during the August coup, Shevardnadze went tothe Russian government headquarters when reports said the building was aboutto be stormed by troops loyal to the coup plotters. He stayed there throughthe crucial night of Aug. 20, alongside Russian President Boris Yeltsin.;  When the putsch proved his warnings to be correct, Shevardnadze was back inthe center of Soviet politics. The Democratic Reform Movement, founded by himand other liberals, gained support as a potential base for a social democraticparty; Shevardnadze was brought back into the Kremlin councils.;   &quot;Thepresident needs him -- not just his advice, not just his ability in foreignaffairs, but his political support,&quot; a Gorbachev aide said. &quot;He needs tobroaden his power base or the center will not hold. Shevardnadze is a majorfigure from an important part of the political spectrum.&quot;;   Gorbachev triedto lure Shevardnadze back into the government in September with a position ona new Security Council that the white-haired Georgian rejected as mere&quot;decoration.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911120  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  734  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 20, 199100325189,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
