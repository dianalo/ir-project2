Contrary to your assertion that the sole purpose ofthe Establishment Clause was to ensure that &quot;no particularreligion in this country can ever get favored treatment,&quot; theFramers also intended to prohibit the government fromfavoring religion over non-religion. To achieve this theysought to keep politics out of religion and religion out ofpolitics, and to ensure government neutrality.Government-sponsored religious displays patently infringeupon these policies.   Even your no-favoritism criterion is breached when cityofficials, acting under the pressure of powerful religiousgroups, display a scene of Jesus's birth holy to Christiansor a menorah commemorating the miracle of the oil to Jews.Apart from the sensibilities of tens of millions of Americannonbelievers, we do not see government displays promotingHinduism, Islam, Buddhism, animism, Shinto or otherpolitically weaker religions that our citizens embrace.</LP><TEXT>   Furthermore, as the distinguished scholar Paul Freund haspointed out, &quot;political division on religious lines is one ofthe principal evils that the First Amendment sought toforestall.&quot; Can anyone who looks outside the U.S. doubt thatinternal strife on matters of faith can destroy civic harmonyfor generations? The evil potential surely exists in ourpluralistic country. In 1984, the solicitor general assertedin the Supreme Court that a Sunday mass sponsored by a townon public property would be constitutional. Let us not godown that dangerous road in order to support religion, whichfrom every indication is doing very well in the U.S. withoutgovernment support.
