Corporate officers and executives can look for 5.5% merit salary increases in 1989, down from this year's 5.8% and the 9.5% raises of 1982, consultant Sibson andamp; Co. says. For all workers, merit raises next year will average 5.2%, little changed from 1988's 5.3% though down sharply from the 9.1% increases of 1982. But as salary boosts slow or stabilize, companies increasingly are shifting emphasis to bonuses and other incentive awards, Sibson's James Mitchell finds.    Jill Kanin-Lovers of Towers Perrin says more companies are funneling what might have been merit money into variable bonus programs to avoid the fixed expense of permanent salary boosts. And Philip Henderson of Mercer Meidinger Hansen expects bonuses paid next year for 1988 performance to top payments this year. Executives, he figures, could end up 1989 with bigger increases in total compensation.    More lower-level managers, even blue-collar workers, will share the incentive money, Hay Group says.    ALL STAFFED UP. That's the message from many employers.    After boosting employment the past few years, Aluminum Co. of America won't be doing any hiring this fall beyond replacing those who leave. &quot;There are no new programs to support new hiring,&quot; a spokesman says. Northrop Corp. and Mattel Inc., too, look for stable employment. Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. figures it might have trouble finding workers in some areas if it wanted them. &quot;Many of our locations are beginning to run smack into very low unemployment rates,&quot; it says.    Where workers are needed, often they're at opposite ends of the training spectrum. Ramada Inc. looks for janitors and maids. Altus Bank hires tellers and clerks because they leave so fast. Among experts in demand at Westinghouse Electric Corp. are electrical, mechanical and industrial engineers. But its doors are closed to one type of specialist: &quot;We don't hire M.B.A.s.&quot;    CHILD-LABOR ABUSE rises with the strong economy.    The Department of Labor found 17,800 minors working illegally in the nine months to June 30, up 11% from the year before. That was atop a 59% spurt in the full year to Sept. 30, 1987, from the year before that. Much of the increase came in the Northeast, where a strong economy propelled employment. &quot;Employers need kids and they're hiring them,&quot; says Nila Stovall, who runs the federal child labor program.    But, unlike the past, factories aren't the main culprits nowadays, says Susan Cowell of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. Demand, she says, comes largely from markets and fast-food outlets that illegally let 14- and 15-year-olds run meat slicers or work after 9 p.m. in the summer and 7 p.m. during the school year.    Much of the abuse comes in suburban areas where, Ms. Cowell says, &quot;many teen-agers want to work.&quot;    EMPLOYEE THEFT costs companies at least $15 billion to $25 billion a year, estimates a report from the Bureau of National Affairs, a business publisher. Many workers, says the report, consider pilfering a well-deserved perk.    PENSION FUNDS are likely to shift investment strategies over the next few years to de-emphasize equity portfolios in favor of index funds, fixed-income funds and bond portfolios, says the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a study group. Market volatility plus tougher laws and accounting standards are pushing the switch, it says.    VIDEO DISPLAY TERMINALS may cause eye strain and muscle-and-bone ache for some users. But there have been few worker compensation claims tied to VDT use, says the National Council on Compensation Insurance, which represents insurers.    BUREAUCRATS THINK BIG. Former government officials sit on 49% of the boards of companies with $5 billion or more assets, 37% of the over-$1 billion companies but a mere 15% of the under-$400 million industrials, according to a survey by recruiter Korn/Ferry International.    CONTINGENT EMPLOYEES aren't treated second class, firms insist.    At Budget Rent a Car Corp., contingent workers -- including temporary, part-time, free-lance, contract and leased employees -- receive few of the benefits extended regular workers. Still, hiring them performs a social good, the company asserts; contingent employment, it says, gives some workers the flexibility they need. &quot;Part-time employment accommodates special work needs,&quot; Home Group Inc. concurs.    To the complaint that contingents are given little training, Worthem Banking Corp. responds that nearly all its workers -- regular and contingent -- are trained on the job. &quot;There's no difference in treatment,&quot; it avers. International Business Machines Corp. says just being exposed to &quot;the high-tech nature of the business&quot; gives contingents &quot;a higher level of skill.&quot;    Says Miniscribe Corp., &quot;Our goal is not to exploit them but convert them to be part of the company.&quot;    THE CHECKOFF: Singing for sales, Performing Artists Diversified hires entertainers to sell office supplies while they pursue stage careers. . . . Discharged managers get 6.7 months of severance pay but need only 5.1 months to find a job, leaving them six weeks of extra pay, outplacement consultant Drake Beam Morin consoles. </TEXT></DOC>
