Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association, Vernon, Texas, was closed and nearly all of its assets and deposits were transferred to a newly chartered institution to be run by federal regulators. The Texas Sandamp;L commissioner closed Vernon after finding that the thrift was insolvent and had &quot;substantially dissipated its assets through unsafe and unsound practices.&quot;    Vernon was a state-chartered institution with nine offices in Texas and one office in Oklahoma. The new institution, of the same name, will be headquartered in Dallas and begin operations today under management appointed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which took over the failed thrift.    The Bank Board said that 96%, or $1.3 billion, of Vernon's loans were more than 60 days delinquent. The Bank Board said that Vernon dissipated its assets by paying excessive compensation and dividends to its major officers and shareholders, and purchasing a beach house and five airplanes for the use of executives.    In the past five years, Vernon's assets increased more than tenfold, the Bank Board said. The association's growth was fueled by solicitation of high-cost brokered deposits and so-called jumbo certificates of deposit. &quot;Most of the proceeds of the association's deposit solicitation campaign were used to fund large speculative acquisition, development and construction loans,&quot; the Bank Board said in a release.    Separately, the Bank Board closed First Federal of Maryland, Hagerstown, because of insolvency. It had assets of $115 million. The thrift's four offices will reopen today as branches of Columbia First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Washington, D.C., which took over its insured deposits.    First Southern Savings Association of Jackson County, Pascagoula, Miss., also was closed over the weekend because it was insolvent. First Southern was a state-chartered stock association with $50 million in assets and three offices. First Southern's insured deposit accounts were transferred to Magnolia Federal Bank for Savings, Hattiesburg, Miss.    The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. provided funds to assist in the acquisition of Bayou Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, New Orleans. First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, also of New Orleans, acquired Bayou Federal, which had $26 million in assets. It was the seventh FSLIC-assisted transaction this year.    Morocco State Bank, Morocco, Ind., was closed by state regulators and reopened on Saturday as a branch of DeMotte State Bank, DeMotte, Ind., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. Morocco had assets of $15 million and deposits of $14 million.    On Friday state banking authorities also closed Madill Bank andamp; Trust Co., Madill, Okla. Its two offices will reopen today as branches of First American National Bank of Tishomingo, Okla. Madill had total assets of $37 million when it was closed Friday by state banking authorities. First American will assume deposits of about $37 million in 7,200 accounts.    New City Bank, Orange, Calif., was closed Friday by state banking authorities. Its offices will reopen today as branches of Colonial Bank, a newly chartered national bank also in Orange. New City had assets of about $21 million.    The latest closures bring the number of banks to fail this year to 50. </TEXT></DOC>
