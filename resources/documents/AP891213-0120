Police said about 400people were arrested and 12 injured, including six officers.   The clash, one of the largest in South Africa this year,occurred when blacks began a march toward the courthouse in Ermelo,120 miles east of Johannesburg, despite having been deniedpermission for the protest.   Police headquarters said marchers began throwing stones afterofficers tried to disperse them with tear gas and stun grenades.Officers then fired birdshot, injuring at least six people,including a child, police said.   The five wounded adults were held in custody to face charges ofpublic violence, while 397 people arrested at the courthouse werereleased with a warning, police said.   While the clash was in progress, government offices in Ermelo'sblack township were firebombed, police said.   The marchers were protesting the start of court proceedingsagainst 88 residents of the township for not paying electric bills.   Earlier Wednesday, police reported three more deaths infactional fighting between rival black groups near Durban, bringingthe death toll around the port city this month to 71. Law and OrderMinister Adriaan Vlok said 380 police reinforcements were beningsent into the area's embattled shantytowns.   Several dozen other blacks have been killed elsewhere in NatalProvince this month in an escalation of a political power strugglethat has claimed about 2,500 lives in three years.   Police also reported more violence related to a six-week strikeby more than 20,000 black employees of the state transport company,which runs rail and harbor operations nationwide. Five coaches wereset afire and a constable was thrown to his death from a movingtrain near Kathlehong, east of Johannesburg.   South African Transport Services said it fired 2,477 morestrikers, raising to 15,094 the number dismissed during the strike.The strikers are demanding an increase of their minimum monthlywage from $225 to $560.   The main combatants in the Natal violence are the UnitedDemocratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition, andInkatha, 1.5 million-member political group headed by Zulu leaderMangosuthu Buthelezi.   Both groups oppose apartheid, but they have been battling eachother for supremacy in Natal since late 1986.   The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the outlawedAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement, favors protests,strikes and sanctions to pressure the white-run government.   The relatively conservative Buthelezi does not support suchmeasures and has been criticized by the front for participating inthe black homeland system. Both groups concede they do not havefull control of all their supporters.   Hundreds of residents in the townships have fled their homes,and some are living with white friends or employers in Durban.</TEXT></DOC>
