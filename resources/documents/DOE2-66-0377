A magnetic field of up to --180G may be applied along theaxis of the device. As a result of charge exchange collisions, the ionbeam is attenuated as it propagates into the target region. However,under certain conditions of magnetic field strength and neutral gas pressure,they have observed a &quot;reemergence&quot; of the beam on axis far downstreamin the target. This reemergence of the ion beam is attributed to a focusingof the ions by a self-consistently produced radial ambipolar electricfield. The effect may be expected to occur in other types of plasma devicesas well, whenever a sufficiently large radially inward electric fieldis present.</TEXT></DOC>
