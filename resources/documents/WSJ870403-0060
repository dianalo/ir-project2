The purchase was made from Centocor Inc. as part of a broad agreement that will give Centocor a major stake in the company.    The agreement provides for increased collaboration between the biotechnology concerns, which have complementary specialties. Repligen is developing products using gene-splicing techniques; Malvern, Pa.-based Centocor is developing products using monoclonal antibodies -- immune-system components used in diagnostic testing that have shown promise as anti-cancer drugs. The companies said they plan to enable the transfer of research projects between the concerns that fit their respective strengths.    Repligen said it will take a $17.3 million charge for its fourth quarter ended March 31 as a result of its agreement with Centocor. Other terms of the pact call for Centocor to receive 1,225,000, or 17%, of Repligen's common shares, and for Repligen to receive $2.9 million cash.    The two companies developed the experimental AIDS vaccine in an effort with Duke University Medical School and the National Institutes of Health. Last month Repligen said it plans to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration in midsummer to begin clinical tests on humans with the drug. The company has said it hopes to begin the tests in the fall. Repligen added that it plans to initiate discussions with potential marketing partners for the vaccine.    Under the agreement Repligen also will receive from Centocor the rights to an immune-system stimulant with potential as an anti-cancer drug and to a different immune-system agent that might boost the effectiveness of other vaccines.    Repligen, which went public in May 1986, estimated that it will report a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of about $18 million, including the $17.3 million charge connected with the Centocor pact. In the year-earlier quarter, the company had a loss of about $813,000.    Centocor's 17% stake will make it Repligen's largest holder. Under the agreement, Centocor also will receive options to purchase an additional 245,000 shares of Repligen common over the next five years. The options can be exercised at $27 a share for the first three years and $45 a share after that, Repligen said.    Separately, Centocor said it will record a one-time, after-tax, non-extraordinary gain of $7.2 million in the first quarter as a result of the agreement with Repligen. In the 1986 first quarter, Centocor earned $1.6 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $7.3 million.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Repligen shares closed at $19.75, up $1.25. Centocor finished at $44, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
