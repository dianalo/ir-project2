The event raised a record $44,172,186 in pledged donations,organizers said.   Weeping, the comedian narrated a tribute to Davis, who appearedat the Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon for 13 years,including last year while suffering from the cancer that killedhim. On Sunday, Lewis dedicated the telethon to his friend.   ``There is only one reason why he isn't here with us this year,and that is the only thing that could have kept him away,'' Lewissaid Monday. ``When you knew him, you knew that God made somethingspecial.''   The Labor Day telethon changed settings this year, moving toHollywood after 17 years in Las Vegas. Producers said they wantedto cut costs and update the telethon's image.   The Las Vegas shows raised millions in pledges, with last year'stally a record $42.2 million to fight 40 neuromuscular diseasesthat kill and cripple thousands of people annually, most of themyoung people.   In 17 years in Las Vegas, Lewis has raised more than half abillion dollars.   While donors phoned in pledges to the studio on SunsetBoulevard, about 40 protesters marched outside, demanding moreaccountability for the money.   ``We want them to open up and really show us what they haveachieved,'' said Sue Marston, secretary of a group called theAlliance for Research Accountability.   ``Every year they say they have a new break,'' she said. ``Theyalways say the cure is right around the corner. They always saythey're breathtakingly close.''   Gary Cifra, president of the activist group said, ``There's notreatment and there's no cure. Something's wrong.''   Telephone calls made about 30 minutes after the telethon wasover to the Los Angeles and New York offices of the MuscularDystrophy Association Inc. were unanswered. Calls made backstage toseek comment about the protesters' complaints also were unanswered.   John Neunzer, 25, sat in a wheelchair with a sign saying: ``OnceJerry's kid, now a forgotten adult.'' He said he was a poster childfor the 1975 Labor Day telethon.   This year's syndicated telethon, broadcast from the Star SearchTheater, where Ed McMahon presents his glitzy talent show, was seenon 200 stations nationwide.</TEXT></DOC>
