In some ways, this summer's spate of strikes has been reminiscentof the years before Mrs. Thatcher was elected prime minister in May1979 on a wave of anti-union sentiment.   But in crucial other ways, they reflect a recognition that theold days of militancy and unbridled power, which was partly to blamefor infecting the economy with the so-called ``British disease,''are over.   Strikes this summer in public transportation, city halls and theBritish Broadcasting Corp. ended with employers surrendering on allfronts: yielding near double-digit pay raises and abandoning demandsfor higher productivity and new bargaining procedures.   But dockworkers striking to preserve a 42-year-old system of jobguarantees were soundly defeated.   The longshoremen were the last of the once-mighty blue-collarbattalions of organized labor to be vanquished by a Conservativegovernment that had already emasculated the steel, coal-mining andnewspaper-production unions.   The public could see a case for giving railwaymen and town hallclerks pay increases that overtake resurging inflation. But it wouldnot buy the longshoremen's attempt to preserve what it saw as arelic of union featherbedding.   The unions have learned to play by the Thatcher rules, among thetoughest in any Western democracy, and even to turn them toadvantage.   ``It's been a very difficult 10 years for the trade unionmovement, but it hasn't been deadly,'' said Norman Willis, generalsecretary of the Trades Union Congress, the national laborfederation. ``Anyone who thought the unions could be written off waswrong.''   Laws passed since 1980 ban sympathy walkouts and force unions tohold secret ballots by members before calling strikes. Unions thatcall illegal strikes can be bankrupted by fines for contempt ofcourt and lawsuits by employers for strike-inflicted losses.   The rail unions won public sympathy partly because their leadersfollowed the rules and could not be accused of foisting their wisheson the rank-and-file.   ``Unions have learned to live within the law,'' said the TUC'sWillis.   Public opinion polls indicate that for the first time in 25years, most Britons no longer consider the unions too powerful.   Soundings in September by Gallup and by Market Opinion andResearch International also found majorities sympathizing with thissummer's wage strikes, despite the commuter misery, and blaming thegovernment, not the unions, for economic problems.   Fifty-four percent still think the unions are dominated by``extremists and militants,'' the poll showed. But overall, thechange is profound.   No longer disliked because they are no longer feared, the unionshave faded as an issue. And the union-bashing that helped Mrs.Thatcher to three successive election victories, no longer lookslike a vote-puller, now that the unions are being seen as underdogs.   ``None of this means that the unions are on the offensive,''cautions Martin Jacques, editor of the monthly Marxism Today. ``Whatis does mean is that ... the unions have got their heads above theparapet again. And for Thatcherism they no longer represent easypolitical pickings.''   The victorious summer strikes have encouraged others, likeambulance drivers who are citing the railwaymen's increase in anattempt to justify their demands for a raise above the 8.3 percentinflation rate.   With pay settlements averaging 9.5 percent, fears have arisenthat Britain is headed back into the inflationary spiral of the1970s.   Both in numbers and political clout, the unions have taken a longfall from their 1970s heyday, when striking miners helped topplePrime Minister Edward Heath's Conservative government and when Laborgovernments consulted union bosses almost as regularly as Cabinetministers.   The membership of the Trades Union Congress has slumped from 12.2million to 8.7 million, the lowest in 20 years. In 1979, 29.5million work days were lost through strikes. Last year, the totalwas 3.7 million.   A record 13 percent unemployment rate in the mid-1980s alsodampened union militancy. And with the 1985 collapse of a year-longstrike by the Marxist-led National Union of Mineworkers, whichdirectly challenged the Conservative government, the Thatchervictory seemed complete.   But while most analysts agree that things will never be the same,the unions are emerging from the 1980s in fair shape after somepainful adaptations.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
