With civil war raging in El Salvador, it seemed unlikely such ameeting could occur anytime soon.   Also Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said a U.S. StateDepartment videotape purporting to show leftist Salvadoranguerrillas training in Nicaragua was a fake and a ``cheappropaganda'' move by Washington.   Nine days of peace talks between the leftist Sandinistagovernment and the Contras, as the U.S.-backed rebels are known,ended Tuesday in stalemate at the Washington headquarters ofOrganization of American States.   The talks dealt with reinstating a 19-month cease-fire thatNicaragua President Daniel Ortega ended Nov. 1 and demobilizationof the Contra force, most of whom are in border camps in Honduras.   Victor Hugo Tinoco, the deputy foreign minister leading theNicaraguan delegation at the talks, said his government would callfor an emergency meeting of the presidents of Honduras, ElSalvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica.   Presidents of the four countries and Ortega agreed Aug. 7 thatthe Contras should dismantle by Dec. 5, a deadline the Sandinistadelegation offered to extend until Dec. 31.   The Contras were not part of the pact and have refused todemobilize before general elections scheduled for Feb. 25 inNicaragua.   ``This effort of peace proposed by President Daniel Ortega ...succumbed because of the intransigent attitude of thecounterrevolutionary delegation,'' said a communique from Ortega'soffice.   It blamed the United States for the failure of the talks, sayingWashington's continued funding of the rebels allowed them to remainin place, and it said Honduras was harboring the Contras.   ``There is no doubt that the principal responsibility for theexistence and permanence of the Contras in Honduras falls on theHonduran government, which is the one that should impede the use ofits territory as a base of aggression against a neighboringcounty,'' the communique said.   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras said Wednesday he wouldnot attend an emergency meeting. Azcona said the five presidents inthe Aug. 7 pact signed in Tela, Honduras, had agreed to a Dec. 8-9meeting, which he would attend.   ``Ortega is losing much prestige,'' Azcona told reporters at anairport news conference before leaving for vacation Wednesdaymorning. ``Ortega is being called upon to maintain a steady andserene position ... and not to be worrying the area with hisattitude.''   Honduras is holding general elections on Sunday and Azcona, whoby law cannot seek re-election after his four-year term, is to handover power to his successor Jan. 27.   Carlos Rivera, acting foreign minister of Costa Rica, toldreporters in San Jose on Wednesday that his country would notattend an emergency meeting.   ``We do not believe that an emergency meeting is necessary,''Rivera said after meeting with President Oscar Arias. ``We haveprogrammed a meeting of the presidents in Nicaragua for December,and there we can discuss the Contra demobilization.''   In El Salvador, fierce fighting now in its 12th day between theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas and therightist government made it unlikely that President AlfredoCristiani could attend an special summit soon.   There was no immediate response from Guatemalan PresidentVinicio Cerezo.   The fighting in El Salvador drew attention away from theSandinista-Contra talks.   But Nicaragua was back in the spotlight on Monday when the StateDepartment screened a video it said showed top leaders of theguerrillas taking part in training maneuvers at El Tempisquetraining center, north of Managua.   The United States regularly accuses the Sandinistas of training,supplying and supporting the Salvadoran guerrillas. The Nicaraguangovernment has said it hasn't done so since 1980.   ``This video does not contain definite proof,'' said ForeignMinistry spokeswoman Mercedes Borge. ``We consider it a montage.This is just cheap propaganda by the State Deparment.''   There is increased likelihood now of a Sandinista ``finaloffensive,'' such as the one in March 1988 that drove right intoHonduran territory.   That offensive, called ``Danto 88,'' took place shortly afterCongress refused to keep funding the Contras militarily, and forcedthe rebels to the negotiating table with the Sandinistas. Sincethen, Congress has been giving the Contras aid in the form of tentsand other non-lethal military supplies.   The Sandinistas, who in 1979 ousted the government of rightistPresident Anastasio Somoza, said that as of mid-1989 the 8-year-oldwar with the rebels left 57,000 dead, injured or missing.</TEXT></DOC>
