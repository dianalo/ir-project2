Douglas, commissioner of the Treasury Department's Financial ManagementService (FMS).andP;  &quot;But I'm a professional manager and a pretty damn good one,if I do say so myself.&quot;andM;Douglas, 59, had 20 years' experience with the Internal Revenue Servicebefore he was appointed to the commissioner's post in 1980.andP;  At the time,Douglas said, FMS was having problems.andM;&quot;They were getting some of the same attention the Housing and UrbanDevelopment Department is getting now,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;When I took the job, theyknew what they were getting.andM;&quot;I know how to get things done.andP;  People are going to make you successful ornot successful.andP;  My first commandment is, managers get paid to get results.andM;FMS handles the government's payments for contracts and procurements.andP;  Eachmonth, it sends 38 million Social Security payments, retirement benefits forrailroad and civil service retirees, civilian payroll, and veterans' anddisability payments.andM;&quot;We touch the lives of more than 115 million people,&quot; Douglas said.andM;FMS also sends out $80 million in tax refunds and collects $1 trillion inpayments to the government each year.andP;  &quot;We try to use all the best systemsand approaches that are used in financial management in the private sector,&quot;he said.andM;Douglas expects a contract award late this fiscal year for System 90, a $60million effort to modernize FMS payments, cash management, accounting andcredit administration.andM;Another major system under redesign is Star, a $10.1 million program forgovernmentwide accounting and reporting.andM;&quot;The old accounting and reporting system was 1960s software with a lot ofproblems in documentation,&quot; Douglas said.andM;Douglas expressed pride in FMS' work with the Office of Management and Budgetin developing the Unified Systems Approach, a series of models of highlyeffective financial activities.andM;&quot;You've got to hold program managers accountable,&quot; Douglas said.andP;  &quot;You cannotrun a multibillion-dollar business and not know what your financial conditionis.&quot;andM;Douglas' personnel philosophy is to make people work hard on interestingproblems.andP;  &quot;Give them an opportunity to fell good about themselves.andP;  Makethem as good as they can be.&quot;andM;He likes to challenge the status quo.andM;&quot;I always look for a better way to do things,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We welcome the ideaof change.andP;  We know we're going to have to plan for the future or somebodyelse will do it to us.&quot;andP;  Three times a year, Douglas takes his six assistantcommissioners off-site to discuss changes at FMS.andM;&quot;Management is getting people to focus on certain objectives and bedetermined they're going to accomplish those things, come hell or highwater,&quot; Douglas said.andP;  &quot;I get paid to provide vision and drive and leadershipto this organization.&quot;andM;Douglas majored in history at the Citadel in Charleston, S.C., and completedthree years of postgraduate study at the University of South Carolina.andO;Before college, he served four years in the Army.andM;His career in government was unplanned.andM;&quot;I was starving as a graduate teaching assistant and somebody mentioned atest,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Depending on the results, you were hired as either a GS-5or 7.&quot;andM;He entered the IRS structured training program.andP;  While teaching a revenueofficer training class, he was recruited as a manager.andM;Douglas said a unique FMS program gives cash awards to people in non-Treasuryagencies who make special contributions to cash management, credit and debtcollection.andP;  Last year, 96 awards were given.andM;Profit CenterandM;&quot;It makes the point that if we're going to be successful, we need a lot ofpeople in the agencies working toward that,&quot; Douglas said.andP;  &quot;It we look backat the earnings and savings we've brought about in the 1980s, the total is$23 billion.andP;  We are a profit center in government.andP;  Our earnings are far inexcess of our budget.&quot;andM;In spite of increased responsibilities, the FMS budget is no larger than in1980, adjusting for inflation, Douglas said.andP;  FMS finished the 1980s with 25percent fewer employees.andM;In 1984, Douglas received the Distinguished National Leadership Award fromthe Association of Government Accountants, and the Executive Excellence Awardfrom the Intergency Committee on Information Resources Management.andM;In 1985, he won the Senior Executive Association's Executive AchievementAward.andP;  In 1986, American University gave him the Roger W. Jones Award forExecutive Leadership, and in 1987 the Joint Financial Management ImprovementProgram presented him with the Donal L.
