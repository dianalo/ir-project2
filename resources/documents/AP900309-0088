Mandela, 71, was the world's best-known political prisoner untilSouth Africa freed him last month and legalized the ANC guerrillagroup as a step toward possible white-black negotiations.   The ANC estimates there are 15,000 political exiles livingthroughout Africa who may return to South Africa now that the ANCand several other anti-government groups are legal.   Mandela interrupted a visit to Tanzania to fly to Addis Ababafor the speech in the ornate Africa Hall of the Organization ofAfrican Unity.   Afterward, he returned to Tanzania to complete his scheduledsix-day visit with a tour of ANC guerrilla training camps in theEast Africa nation. He will leave for Sweden on Sunday.   Mandela said he had received military training in Ethiopiabefore he was arrested in 1962 for illegally leaving South Africa.He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison for sabotage andtreason. The government commuted that sentence last month.   Mandela plans to travel to Sweden next week.   A spokesman for Sweden's Foreign Ministry, Lars-Olof Lundberg,said today that Mandela has asked to cut two days off his plannedweeklong visit.   He gave no reason for Mandela's request, but the Swedish newsagency TT said Mandela was concerned with unrest in South Africa'sblack homelands and a warning from the white-led South Africangovernment that it might intervene with emergency powers to end theviolence.   More than 20 people were killed this week in clashes betweenhomeland authorities and groups demanding reincorporation intoSouth Africa, and in factional fights over local issues in blacktownships in South Africa.   The ANC named Mandela deputy president last week, making him theeffective leader of the organization. ANC President Oliver Tambo,once Mandela's law partner in South Africa, entered a Stockholmclinic in January after suffering a stroke. Mandela was expected tospend considerable time visiting Tambo.</TEXT></DOC>
