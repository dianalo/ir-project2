Cogan, a longtime Wall Streetplayer in the corporate takeover game with a string ofprofitable acquisitions, is raising money from institutionalinvestors for a new buy-out fund.   Having used his own money and that of a few partners inthe past, Mr. Cogan now is approaching pension funds,insurance companies and other big investors to form his firstbuy-out fund. His aim: to raise $250 million in equity,enough to finance six or seven deals with combined purchaseprices of about $1 billion.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I've never seen the investment opportunities that we havetoday,&quot; Mr. Cogan says, pointing to the many debt-ladenedU.S. companies needing restructuring and scores more foreigncompanies also starved for capital. One of his selling pointsto potential investors is a clean credit history that Mr.Cogan says will provide access to bank financing. &quot;We areable to borrow capital from the banks when most peoplecan't,&quot; he says.   Mr. Cogan's approach to potential buyouts was shaped bylessons from what became his most publicized failed bid. In1983, Mr. Cogan thought Sotheby Parke Bernet Group PLC lookedlike a bargain and he attempted a takeover. The Britishauction house resisted mightily; it delayed Mr. Cogan's offerand eventually outlasted him by turning to developer A.Alfred Taubman, who made a friendly bid supported bySotheby's board.   &quot;That taught me a lesson. I'll never do another hostile&quot;deal, says the 53-year-old Mr. Cogan. While he and hispartners made $10 million on their Sotheby's stock, Mr. Cogansays the episode also drove home the need for financialstaying power. &quot;We didn't have the resources&quot; then, he says.&quot;I want to make sure this time that we have the money tocarry out our ideas.&quot;   The first $25 million for the new fund, to be called NewPatriot Fund LP, will come from Mr. Cogan's umbrella company,21 International Holdings Inc. He hopes institutionalinvestors will kick in the rest, attracted by his average 43%annual return over his 17 years in the acquisition business.Because deals today need to be more conservatively financed,he says that investors in his new buy-out fund can expectmore returns of around 25% a year.   Mr. Cogan's roots are on Wall Street with the firm ofCogan, Berlind, Weill andamp; Levitt, a predecessor of what todayis Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. He left the firm in 1973after a falling out with then-partner Sanford Weill, nowchairman of Primerica Corp. (As a sign that there are no hardfeelings, Primerica's Smith Barney, Harris Upham unit ismarketing Mr. Cogan's new fund to investors.)   Mr. Cogan's first big acquisition was General FeltIndustries Inc. in 1974. That was followed by KnollInternational Inc. in 1977, New York's 21 Club restaurant in1984, and Sheller-Globe Corp. and Color Tile Inc. in 1986.Along the way there were smaller deals, and after Sotheby's,Mr. Cogan also struck out in a 1985 bid for L.F. Rothschild,Unterberg, Towbin, the securities firm.   Mr. Cogan started selling properties in 1987. By lastyear, he figures he and his partners had collected $900million on acquisitions for which they had invested about$220 million in equity (21 Club wasn't sold). While othersare suffering through the aftermath of the 1980s borrowingbinge, Mr. Cogan boasts, &quot;I never missed an obligation in mylife.&quot; He says lenders for his various deals received $1billion in interest payments and $1.3 billion in principalpayments, all on time and with all debt repaid at originalissue price or higher.   Mr. Cogan, meanwhile, also has attracted some controversy,including a 1989 lawsuit in which the buyers of ShellerGlobealleged they were misled on the auto-parts company'sfinancial condition. The buyers were United TechnologiesCorp. and the leveraged buy-out firm then known as GibbonsGreen van Amerongen.   To settle the dispute, Mr. Cogan in October agreed to paythe buyers a package of cash and securities that he values at$33 million; the buy-out firm, now called Gibbons Goodwin vanAmerongen, said in a letter to its investors that itsaccounting of the settlement values it at $50.3 million. Bothsides say that, as part of their agreement, they can'tcomment on the settlement.   Even though the matter was settled amicably, institutionalinvestors closely scrutinize such situations, particularlywhen they have a choice of investing in a variety of otherbuy-out funds. Former Treasury Secretary William Simon, forexample, currently is trying to raise a $500 million fund.Buy-out kings Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. as well asMinneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs also are soliciting money.   Mr. Cogan agrees that raising buy-out money &quot;is going tobe very tough to do.&quot; But the abundance of investmentopportunities makes him willing to spend the next nine monthstrying to put the fund together. &quot;I believe this is awatershed time in my life,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
