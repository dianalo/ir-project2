Newspapers urged state employees engaged in embezzling, briberyand speculation to take advantage of a grace period that runsthrough Oct. 31 to turn themselves in.   Those who turn over illicit earnings will be treated leniently,but those who try to conceal them will be severely punished, theChinese Communist Party Politburo has decided, major newspapers said.   It was the latest move in an anti-corruption campaign launchedthis summer to counter charges of rampant abuse of officialprivilege _ a rallying cry of the pro-democracy movement crushed onJune 3-4.   After a 10-month audit, the government ordered the companies,including one linked to snior leader Deng Xiaoping's son, to pay$13.8 million in back taxes, penalties and restitution of illegallyearned profits, Auditor-General Lu Peijian told the State Council,China's cabinet.   Among the audited companies were two conglomerates closed by thePolitburo last month in the crackdown on corruption _ the KanghuaDevelopment Corp. and the China Incomic Development Corp., theofficial Xinhua News Agency said.   Kanghua, under the auspices of the China Welfare Fund for theHandicapped, was one of China's largest foreign trade firms. Deng'sson, Deng Pufang, runs the China Welfare Fund.   The other audited companies were China International Trust andInvestment Corp., the nation's leading company for attractingforeign investment, the Everbright Industrial Co., which hassubsidiaries in Hong Kong, and the China Rural Trust and InvestmentCorp.   Lu said officials responsible for illegal activities would bepunished by state supervision and judicial action, according toXinhua. The report did not name the individuals and it was unclearwho would be held accountable.   All state industries will be subject to regular auditing andsupervision from now on, he said.   The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported that a Kanghuasubsidiary in June 1988 signed a contract with an agency in Jiangsuprovince to buy 34,990 barrels of crude oil for $23 a barrel. Thecompany earned about $74,000 when it resold the crude oil at aprofit, the paper said.   In another case, an Everbright subsidiary in Beijing purchased$7.2 million in the Shenzhen special economic zone, across theborder from Hong Kong, at a black market rate of about 6 yuan to thedollar, according to the paper.   It then resold the money to the Ningpo City Development Bank andother organizations at rates as high as 7.25 to $1, almost twice theofficial exchange rate, earning $516,000, the report said.   The official exchange rate is 3.72 yuan to the dollar, butcompanies will pay much more for U.S. Dollars, needed for foreigninvestment and to buy foreign technology and consumer goods.   Xinhua said four of the five companies were involved inunauthorized foreign currency dealings.   Meanwhile, the government announced Wednesday that Chinesestudents, who for decades have enjoyed free schooling, will have tofoot part of the bill for their college education.   The new regulation, which goes into effect this fall, followsseveral new education measures designed to avoid student movementssuch as the spring pro-democracy protests. Those ended with the Junemilitary crackdown.   The government has also cut this year's freshman class by 30,000,ordered the freshman class at Beijing University to undergo a yearof military training, and ordered graduates to get work experiencebefore starting graduate degree programs.</TEXT></DOC>
