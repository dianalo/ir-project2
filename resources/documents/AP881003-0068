Col. Oscar Florendo, chief military spokesman, said Air ForceLt. Col. Francisco Baula, Philippine Constabulary Capt. RoqueMaranon and trainee Inocencio Cuyuca were arrested around noon at abar along Manila Bay.   Baula was former operations officer of the 420th Supply Wing ofthe Philippine Air Force and led the takeover of Villamor Air Basein Manila during the Aug. 28, 1987, attempt to topple PresidentCorazon Aquino.   Maranon was among dissident officers who took over Camp Olivas,a constabulary garrison in central Luzon, during the failedattempt, in which at least 53 people were killed and more than 300wounded. He was formerly a member of the Presidential SecurityGroup during the administration of ousted President FerdinandMarcos.   Florendo said the three would be charged with mutiny. Hepresented the renegade soldiers to reporters, but they made nostatement.   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, Manila area commander, said $5,000 inpesos was found in Baula's car. Asked whether the money was tofinance a new coup attempt, Biazon replied ``it's for the boys,''meaning rebel recruits.   Last week, Biazon told reporters that unidentified businessmenand opposition politicians were under surveillance for possiblelinks to the mutineers.   The arrests bring to more than 70 the number of rightwingextremists captured in recent weeks. They include former soldierslinked to Marcos.   Florendo refused to speculate when the military would recapturethe leader of the 1987 coup attempt, former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan.   Honasan was arrested last December but escaped the followingApril from a prison ship in Manila Bay. Last Tuesday, securityforces arrested former Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano, another keyleader of the August 1987, uprising, during a raid on a hotel inQuezon City.   Matillano also escaped last April in a separate incident.   During today's news conference, Florendo also announced thearrests of eight New People's Army rebels operating in the capital.He said the eight, most of them teenagers, were apprehended inraids Saturday and Sunday near Fort Bonifacio, headquarters of thePhilippine Army.   He said the eight were believed to be members of urban guerrillaassassination teams, which have claimed responsibility for killingscores of soldiers and police in the Manila area.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told a congressional committeelast week that about 2,800 rebels and sympathizers were believed tobe hiding in Manila.   Florendo said the eight were working as sidewalk ice creamvendors.</TEXT></DOC>
