A Dade County circuit-court judge declared the guard incompetent to stand trial and sent him to a mental hospital. But the incident didn't end there. The widow of the slain guard filed suit in circuit court against the bank. Her allegation: The bank should have known of the man's propensity for crazy behavior.    Last month, the bank, privately held Totalbank, agreed to pay the widow $300,000 to settle the suit.    The suit was one of a growing number of cases in which companies are charged with &quot;negligently&quot; hiring or retaining employees who later commit crimes. Typically, the suits charge that the company failed to adequately check references, criminal records or general background that would have shown the employee's likelihood of aberrant behavior.    The suits worry companies because of the potential liability as well as the increased burden in screening applicants. &quot;I don't believe companies should have to speak to the kindergarten teacher to make a reasonably prudent investigation,&quot; says Mary Schuette, a labor lawyer for Consolidated Edison Co. in New York.    Thus far, most rulings suggest that jobs that pose the greatest risk to the public require the most extensive background checks. Companies complain, though, that obtaining even basic information about job applicants is difficult because many employers, fearing privacy and defamation suits, supply the skimpiest of references for former employees.    &quot;We're in a quandary, and we're not exactly sure what we can do about it,&quot; says Diana Belbruno, a lawyer for Hartford Insurance Group.    The suits are part of the trend of crime victims suing the closest available &quot;deep pocket&quot; to recover monetary damages. In these cases, they are seeking to stretch the legal theory that companies are liable for their employees' conduct when they are carrying out a job-related task. Under that theory, for instance, &quot;if a truck driver is reckless and has an accident the employer is responsible,&quot; says John A. McDonald, a Chicago lawyer who represents companies in labor issues.    &quot;Now, recent cases are saying when the worker commits a (crime), the employer may be responsible&quot; -- even if committed outside the scope of the worker's employment, Mr. McDonald says.    Thus, if a truck driver picks up a hitchhiker and rapes her, the victim might sue the company on grounds it failed to discover the driver's criminal record.    Corporate lawyers were dismayed by a 1984 Rhode Island Supreme Court ruling indicating that in sensitive jobs, employers must do an aggressive background search even when nothing negative turns up initially.    In this case, a security guard with Pinkerton's Inc. was found to be a co-conspirator in the theft of some $200,000 in gold from Welsh Manufacturing Co. Welsh sued Pinkerton's, claiming it failed to adequately research the guard's background.    Testimony showed that Pinkerton's had contacted the guard's high school principal, a supervisor at a hospital where he worked briefly and his superior officer in the Navy. Each gave the guard generally positive references, although none said anything about his honesty or trustworthiness. Pinkerton's also checked and found no criminal convictions in Rhode Island.    But in upholding a jury verdict, the court said Pinkerton's should have sought &quot;affirmative statements&quot; on the guard's honesty. &quot;Realizing that job applicants generally provide references who are certain to produce favorable reports, we think that background checks in these circumstances should seek relevant information that might not otherwise be uncovered,&quot; the court said.    The decision was &quot;kind of mind-boggling because they did a pretty good job&quot; of checking background, says Allen N. Shub, a management professor at Chicago's Northeastern Illinois University.    Companies are also confused over whether they should check an applicant's criminal records. In many states, inquiring about arrests is illegal, as is using a prior conviction to deny employment unless it bears on the prospective job.    In a 1983 case, however, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld a verdict that owners of an apartment complex were financially liable for hiring a manager who was convicted of raping a tenant. The court ruled that because a five-year gap existed in the man's employment history, &quot;reasonable care&quot; required the company to check for past crimes. In fact, the man had been in prison for armed robbery. The court said it was thus &quot;foreseeable&quot; he could commit another violent crime.    But the dissenting judge wondered what if the employer had searched the man's criminal record and decided to hire him anyway. &quot;Would the taking of a chance on such an employee have spelled out negligent hiring?&quot; the judge posed. He also worried that such rulings may deter some companies from hiring former convicts.    In other cases, companies are being sued because they fail to fire or reassign employees who later commit a crime.    For instance, Lawrence B. Rodgers, who represented the widow of the slain guard in Miami, says that, according to a deposition read in court, the killer told other employees that marks on his skin were the result of others practicing voodoo on him. He also told an employee that cockroaches were crawling on his skin. Contends Mr. Rodgers, &quot;Reasonably intelligent people might have cause to ask themselves, 'Should this man be walking around with a loaded gun in a bank?'&quot;    But to the bank, that reasoning smacks of &quot;Monday-morning-quarterbacking,&quot; says Robert Tacher, the lawyer who represented Totalbank. &quot;Even assuming that he may have done one or two things, which we don't, that doesn't necessarily mean he was homicidal.&quot;    The bank agreed to settle for $300,000 because it was a lot less than the $1.5 million the widow wanted, Mr. Tacher adds.    As the number of such suits rise, they also carry the potential of causing a clash between public safety and employee privacy. Last September, a woman sued American Airlines in U.S. District Court in northern Illinois for $12 million after she was bitten by a boarding agent trying to stop her from entering a plane in Chicago. The woman, who didn't have a boarding pass, requested that the agent be tested for the AIDS virus, and he tested positive. The woman charged in the suit that American Airlines had negligently kept the agent on the payroll when it &quot;knew or should have known that (the agent) had been exposed to a deadly virus and that he is a violent person and unfit for his job.&quot;    American Airlines declines comment on the case. Enrico J. Mirabelli, the woman's lawyer, acknowledges that if successful, the suit might force companies to test all employees and applicants for communicable diseases -- raising concerns about violation of privacy.    But he maintains, &quot;I'm advocating complete safety for the passengers. How the airline does it is up to them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
