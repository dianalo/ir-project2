STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of thousands of peoplechanting ``Resign! Resign!'' rallied in the nation's two biggestcities today to protest the new Communist-dominated government anddemand a new one be named by the weekend.   Waving red, white and blue national flags, a crowd in Prague'sWenceslas Square cheered opposition calls for a general strike Dec.11 if there is no new government by Sunday.   Boos and derisive whistles greeted the mention of old CommunistParty leaders responsible for 21 years of hard-line policy.   In the nation's second-largest city, Bratislava, tens ofthousands gathered in central Namestie Square despite the numbingcold to vent their anger. They chanted ``Resign!'' and ``Shame!Shame!'' as speaker after speaker accused Premier Ladislav Adamecof ignoring the will of the people.   Civic Forum, the largest opposition movement, demanded electionsby July. A group spokesman, Vaclav Maly, said the opposition hopedto field its own candidates.   ``Thanks for your help and support,'' Maly shouted to the crowdin Prague. ``We need it now more than ever.''   It was the first protest in Prague since Civic Forum staged ageneral strike a week ago. That strike, observed by millions, ledAdamec to agree to relinquish the Communists' 41-year monopoly onpower.   But the new 21-member Cabinet named Sunday contained only fivenon-Communists, and Communists retained all the key ministries.   ``We Want a Happy Christmas, Christmas with a new government,''read a poster near Civic Forum's Prague headquarters today. ``Anold play with a new cast,'' warned another poster on the samewindow.   The turnouts at the rallies were clear signals to the governmentthat the opposition can still draw popular support to back itsdemands for democracy.   ``Long live Havel!'' protesters shouted to welcome playwrightVaclav Havel, the country's most prominent dissident, to WenceslasSquare. The rally was reported live on state radio and television.   State radio estimated the crowd at 200,000, but Westernreporters put it at about 150,000.   ``We feel disappointed and cheated,'' said Michal Sedlacek, arepresentative of striking students who decided to prolong theirtwo-week sit-in at campuses across the country in protest of thenew government.   ``The government doesn't understand the situation fully,''Sedlacek told the cheering crowd. ``We want other changes.''   ``With this government, the leading role of the Communist partywas assured,'' said another speaker, director Miroslav Machocek.   ``In fact, the leading role has been abolished in theconstitution but with this government it exists again,'' he added.Machocek said artists, theaters and galleries will go on strikeuntil Dec. 11.   Actor Milan Knazko, a key Slovak republic figure in the popularuprising, said no rally had been planned in Bratislava, ``but thegovernment had sent us this invitation'' to demonstrate by ignoringthe people.   The new government appeared an attempt by the ruling Communiststo buy time and get reform going at a pace they dictate, ratherthan the hectic tempo forced by the mass demonstrations last month.   Wenceslas Square was the focal point of 11 days of masspro-democracy demonstrations that forced a number of concessionsfrom the Communists last week, including the promise of freeelections and the removal of the party's monopoly on power.   Adamec has so far made no specific mention of free elections.   One of the concessions was the lifting of travel restrictionstoday.   Czechoslovaks were still required, however, to have a visa frommost Western countries they wished to visit, with only Austrialifting visa requirements.   Border guards reported that fewer than 3,000 Czechoslovakscrossed today into Austria. Most were just visiting, lacking enoughmoney to stay permanently. Unlike East Germans going to WestGermany, Czechoslovaks did not receive any ``welcome money'' inAustria.   The relatively light turnout, compared with the flood thatpoured out of East Germany when its borders were opened Nov. 9, wasdue in part to the fact that today was a workday. Also, mostCzechoslovaks do not have much hard currency, and the country'stravel restrictions had not been as stringent as other East bloccountries'.   The opposition saw another of its demands met with theannouncement on the state news agency CTK that it would be given abuilding that had belonged to the Czechoslovak-Soviet FriendshipSociety to use as its Prague headquarters.   Until now, Civic Forum has been operating from the strikingLaterna Magika theater.   The new government includes three people without partyaffiliation and one each from the Socialist and People's parties,which have traditionally been docile Communist allies but havebecome more independent in recent months.   Deputy Defense Minister Col.-Gen. Miroslav Vacek moved up totake over the Defense Ministry, and Frantisek Pinc, a politicallyunknown Communist who last served as director of a nuclear powerstation, got the Interior Ministry.   The official CTK news agency said 11 of the 17 Cabinet ministersin the Czech republic had submitted their resignations, includingthe unpopular ministers of education and justice.</TEXT></DOC>
