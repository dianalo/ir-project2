The $350 million payment, which was expected, is part of the process of winding up Brazil's almost yearlong moratorium on an estimated $67 billion of foreign bank debt.    The payment, which came from Brazil's reserves, covers primarily interest due Jan. 15, 1988, on previously restructured debt.    Including yesterday's payment, Brazil has paid about $1.9 billion to creditor banks in a total of five separate installments the past five weeks to help cover interest arrears. </TEXT></DOC>
