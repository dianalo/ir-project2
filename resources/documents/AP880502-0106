SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Postal executives this week will be introducedto a new breed of postal clerk that may never smile, but which alsonever frowns or gets cranky or takes a break when there's a linewaiting.   It's the new face of postal technology _ automated postal clerks_ and they will begin ``greeting'' the American public later thissummer.   The clerks, Infopost and Autopost, will be on display at theU.S. Postal Service's Third Advanced Technology Conference inWashington this week.   Infopost, which answers customer questions, already is whirringaway in test form. It will be deployed to post offices in theWashington area this summer to see how it does in real-lifemeetings with the public.   Autopost, which weighs mail, takes money, makes change and sellspostage, is still being built, although a wooden mockup will be ondisplay. Field tests of a working model are expected in the fall.   These are but two of the developments that will be underdiscussion at the three-day international conference, wheretechnical managers will exchange ideas about speeding mail movement.   Improved mail-handling technology is critical to speeding upmovement of the increasing volume of mail while holding down costs,explained Kenneth Hunter, senior assistant postmaster general formanagement information and research technology.   Postal officials say the agency needs automation to avoid beingswamped by the 250 billion pieces of mail expected by the year 2000.   Other developments described by U.S. postal officials at apreconference briefing last week included machines that can arrangeletters and parcels so the addresses all face the same way, readZIP codes and handle a variety of other tasks.   Teaching machines to read handwriting, for example, is somethingtechnicians have struggled with in hopes of developing equipment tofind and read ZIP codes and then print a bar code on the letter _like those black lines used on supermarket items.   With the bar code, already widely used by business mailers,letters can be sorted more quickly.   Other items under discussion will include laser equipment tohelp sort mail, automatic truck loading equipment and robots tomove mail containers and do other jobs.   On hand to see the American work and discuss developments intheir own nations will be officials from 16 foreign countries,including Australia, Canada, West Germany, Britain, Japan, theSoviet Union, Switzerland and Uruguay.   While these executives may long for high-speed mail sorters andcargo handlers, the public face of technology will be embodied inInfopost and Autopost. People accustomed to automatic bankingmachines will likely find the new machinery familiar.   Infopost offers information on a television-type screen whichthe customer touches to enter questions. It can respond either withan answer or with more questions.   Asked about rates for overseas mail, for example, the machinecan ask the weight of the item, tell what types of things areallowed to be mailed to the country in question, and give the ratesand expected delivery time for various mail. It also will print theinformation on a slip of paper if asked.   While Infopost deals with just information, Autopost _ alsousing an interactive television screen _ is a mailing station.   It contains a scale which weighs the item to be mailed and asksfor the destination ZIP code. With that information it outlinesmailing options _ first class, priority mail, Express Mail orparcel post, for example _ and tells the cost of each option andhow long it is expected to take for delivery.   The customer can then feed coins, bills or a bank cash card intothe machine, and it will make change and issue a postage-meter-likestrip to be stuck on the letter or parcel. It will also give areceipt, if asked.   The item to be mailed can then be dropped into a mailbox.   While Infopost and Autopost are planned for tryouts in lobbiesof post offices, eventually they could be extended to shoppingmalls, supermarkets and other locations, according to postalmanagers.   Each will be connected to a central commuter, which will monitorthe supply of postage and change, and call for a technician ifproblems develop. The computer will sound an alert if someone triesto break into the machines.   The machines should be able to handle an estimated 68 percent ofpost office customer business, the Postal Service estimates,freeing clerks for more complex transactions.</TEXT></DOC>
