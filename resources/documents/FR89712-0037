Authority</ITAG>EPA is proposing this amendment pursuant to section 12(b) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C.2611(b).Section 12(b) of TSCA requires that any person who exports or intends toexport to a foreign country a chemical substance or mixture for which thesubmission of data is required under TSCA section 4 or 5(b), an order hasbeen issued under section 5, a rule has been proposed or promulgated undersection 5 or 6, or relief has been granted under section 5 or 7 to notifythe Administrator of EPA of such exportation or intent to export. Uponreceipt of such notification, section 12(b) of TSCA reqires EPA to furnishthe government of the importing country with:1. Notice of the availability of data received pursuant to action undersection 4 or 5(b), or2. Notice of such rule, order, action, or relief under section 5, 6, or7.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">EPA maintains a public record of all notices received and sent undersection 12(b), except for information that has been claimed as confidentialbusiness information under TSCA section 14.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of This Proposed Rule</ITAG>EPA is proposing to require persons who export or who intend to exportto a specific country a chemical for which notification is required undersection 12(b) of TSCA by virtue of section 4 test rules to submit a one-timenotice to EPA of that export for each such chemical and country. EPA isnot proposing a change in the current recurring annual export notificationrequirements triggered by a rule, order, action, or relief under sections5, 6, and 7 of TSCA. EPA is neither proposing any change in the requiredcontents of the notice (40 CFR 707.67) nor any revision with regard tothe time deadline for submission of an export notice to EPA, that is, within7 days of forming an intent to export or the date of export, whicheveris earlier, 40 CFR 707.65(a)(3). However, EPA is proposing to require thateach exporter provide only one notification, per chemical, for each countryof export after the issuance of a section 4 test rule. Currently, exportersare required to notify EPA annually of exports of chemicals subject tosection 4 test rules.EPA is also proposing to modify the process for notifying foreign governmentsof export of section 4 test rule chemicals by providing only one noticeper section 4 test rule chemical to each importing country. The contentof the information sent in the proposed one-time notification for section4 test rule chemicals would be identical to that provided under the currentannual notification scheme. Importing countries would get the same informationon section 4 test rule chemicals, but only once.EPA requests comments on this proposed amendment, particularly with regardto whether the proposed changes would provide adequate information to foreigngovernments about chemicals imported from the United States which are subjectto test rules, as well as whether the proposed changes would offer a burdenreduction for the regulated industry. The role of Non-Governmental Organizations(NGOs) in implementing the proposed amendmeants is not addressed becausethe export notification information that such NGOs can obtain is limitedby the provisions of section 14 of TSCA.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Reasons for Proposing This Rule</ITAG>A. BackgroundIn the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 16, 1980 (45 FR 82844), EPA promulgatedrules implementing section 12(b) of TSCA. Persons subject to the implementingrules are currently required to submit a written notice to EPA for thefirst export or intended export to a particular country in a calendar yearfor chemicals subject to a rule, order, action, or relief under sections4, 5, 6, and 7 of TSCA. Upon receipt of such notification from an exporter,the implementing rules require that EPA provide the importing country witha summary of the regulatory action taken or indicate the availability ofdata received pursuant to action under section 4 or 5(b), or notice ofa rule, order, action, or relief under section 5, 6, or 7 of TSCA.At the time EPA promulgated the section 12(b) rule at 40 CFR Part 707,EPA did not have the practical experience it now has in estimating theimpact of certain regulatory actions. At that time EPA did not believethat the rule would impose an excessive burden upon foreign governments,industry, or EPA resources. However, recent experience has demonstratedto EPA that an increasing number of section 12(b) notices are receivedby EPA each year.In 1983, EPA received 438 section 12(b) notices on 15 chemical substances;of this number, none were in response to section 4 test rules. That numberincreased to 524 notices on 37 substances in 1984 (31 in response to section4 actions), 819 notices on 115 substances in 1985 (283 in response to section4 actions), 2,056 notices on 166 substances in 1986 (1,506 in responseto section 4 actions), and 2,367 notices on 282 substances in 1987 (1,703in response to section 4 actions). Approximately 4,300 notices were receivedin 1988 on substances (3,350 in response to section 4 actions). EPA projectedtotals for 1989 are for approximately 4,700 notices (3,752 in responseto section 4 actions); for 1993, the number is expected to be greater than8,200 (6,950 in section 4 actions).The increase in section 12(b) notices received by EPA has led to a correspondingincrease in the number of notices EPA has sent to foreign governments.In 1984, EPA sent 406 notices to foreign governments. This number increasedto 533 in 1985, 869 in 1986, and 1,035 in 1987. Approximately 2,100 noticeswere sent in 1988. EPA projections for 1989 are for over 2,300 noticesto be sent to foreign governments (770 to 1,014 in response to section4 actions). This continually increasing volume of notification has createda situation in which the effectiveness of many foreign governments' importmonitoring programs may be hampered by the processing of more and morenotices.At the present time, a fourth to a half of the section 12(b) notices receivedby EPA from a particular company are other than first-time notices (i.e.,repeat notices for subsequent annual exports to the same country). EPAanticipates that the proportion of repeat notices will grow in relationto the total number of notices received because the regulatory actionsthat trigger section 12(b) reporting requirements either do not sunset(e.g., section 5 or 6 rules) or remain in place for relatively long periodsof time (e.g., section 4 rules). The continuous increase in section 12(b)reporting is making import monitoring more difficult for many foreign countries,is placing an increasing burden on industry, and is placing an increasingadministrative burden on EPA.EPA believes that part of this difficulty is based on the fact that a largenumber of notices sent to foreign governments pertain to section 12(b)reporting for TSCA section 4 test rule chemicals. In most cases, test rulesare issued because EPA does not have sufficient health and safety or environmentaldata on a particular chemical to make a fully informed decision regardingthe appropriateness of regulatory control for that chemical.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These test rules may be in effect for as long as 10 years before theend of the data reimbursement period when they cease to be in effect. EPAbelieves that continued annual reporting under section 12(b) for thesechemicals would be of only limited value to foreign governments. In mostcases, there exists insufficient health or environmental data on thesechemicals, such that EPA has not proposed or taken action to ban or restricttheir production or use, and foreign governments are likely to take noregulatory action either in the absence of data.Because the regulatory actions which trigger section 12(b) reporting requirementsare mandated by TSCA, it is not possible for EPA to change the triggeringactions. EPA believes that the most practical means of maintaining thequality of notification, of improving the scrutiny importing countriesgive to notices, and of reducing burden on both industry and EPA is toamend the section 12(b) reporting rules under 40 CFR Part 707 to reducethe volume of notices. The amendment that EPA believes will retain thegreatest utility to foreign governments while simultaneously resultingin a decreased burden on industry and EPA, would be rescinding the currentannual notice requirement for section 4 test rule chemicals and allowingpersons to submit a one-time notice to EPA for a particular country foreach section 4 test rule chemical.EPA believes these amendments would maintain, if not increase, the degreeof protection to human health and the environment afforded by the currentnotification system while reducing the reporting burden on exporters andthe administrative burden on EPA. Under the current annual notice requirement,a large increase in the volume of annual notices, due primarily to a significantincrease in the number of section 4 test rules promulgated by EPA, hasreduced EPA's ability to respond to requests for additional informationon a particular chemical or export notice. At the same time, the increasingvolume of notices makes it difficult for countries which receive a largenumber of notices to distinguish between chemicals for which EPA has takenaction to restrict based on a determination of unreasonable risk to humanhealth or the environment, and those chemicals for which EPA has requesteddata but not yet made a definitive risk determination. Although EPA providesa copy of the applicable rule, including a summary of the action takenby EPA, many importing country representatives have commented anecdotallythat all section 12(b) notices are considered by importing countries, particularlydeveloping countries, to be of equal concern.EPA believes that the purpose of the export notification requirements ofsection 12(b) of TSCA is to ensure that foreign governments are alertedwhen EPA knows that such governments are importing chemicals about whichEPA has expressed some degree of concern. EPA's responsibility is bothto alert the importing country, and to make information and data availableto the importing government so that government can assess the risks andbenefits of importing and using that chemical. While some countries mayuse the notices to monitor trends in imports from the United States ofchemicals subject to section 12(b), EPA believes the supply of data necessaryto control chemicals within the importing country would be substantiallyunchanged by this proposed rule as there would be little, if any, net lossor supportive data potentially useful in carrying out this function. By decreasing the volume of notices importing countries receive on section4 test rule chemicals for which additional data are being gathered, theproposed rule may actually increase the relative effectiveness of the notificationby allowing foreign governments to focus their efforts on notices for section5, 6, or 7 chemicals for which restrictive regulatory action has been proposedor promulgated. Internationally, the movement is toward differentiationbetween banned or severely restricted chemicals and chemicals for whichadditional data gathering is still ongoing. This proposed rule is a stepin that direction. The differentiation is commonly referred to as a system of Prior InformedConsent (PIC). The United States Government is participating in negotiationswith international organizations such as the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP) on the development of a PIC scheme. This proposed ruleis consistent with the international interest in developing a system ofPIC. EPA believes that by reducing the ever increasing volume of noticesreceived on section 4 test rule chemicals, importing countries can betterdifferentiate between chemicals for which EPA has taken restrictive actionand chemicals for which additional toxicological testing has been required.B. Alternatives Before proposing this rule, EPA considered a variety of other alternativeregulatory approaches to reducing the burden of section 12(b) export notificationand increasing its effectiveness. 1. One alternative would be to establish a new ``sunrise'' date for reportingunder section 12(b) triggered by a final section 4 test rule. One possiblesunrise date considered by EPA would be the date on which the first testdata are required to be submitted under the test rule. In this event, EPAwould have actual test data available when foreign governments were notified.Persons subject to the rule would still be required to submit export noticesto EPA annually thereafter, the EPA would notify such foreign governmentson an annual basis. Thus, importing countries would still receive a largenumber of notifications resulting from section 4 test rules. This new sunrisedate would provide some decrease in burden on industry and EPA, but thedecrease in burden in this instance would not be significant because inmany cases initial section 4 test data are required to be submitted toEPA within a 1-year time frame. EPA also considered another possible sunrise date which would require submissionof a TSCA section 12(b) notice upon the receipt of adverse test data undera section 4 test rule. In this instance, notices to foreign governmentswould be of maximum utility, because EPA would possess actual data regardingthe adverse health or environmental effects of a substance. This new sunrisedate could provide a modest decrease in reporting burden to industry. However,EPA would be required to make rapid, and potentially controversial case-by-casehazard determinations on test data. These determinations would then likelyneed to be made formal by <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices annnouncing EPA's conclusions. This approachwould provide a modest reduction in burden on industy but result in a many-foldincrease in burden on EPA. This approach also contradicts the statutorylanguage of TSCA section 12(b) because export notification is triggeredby a requirement for the submission of data under section 4, not just adversedata. Foreign countries may find knowledge of non-adverse data as usefulas adverse data.2. Another alternative would be to establish a new ``sunset'' date forreporting under section 12(b) triggered by a final TSCA section 4 testrule. One possible sunset date considered by EPA would be the date on whichthe final test data submission is required under the test rule. At thepresent time, persons are subject to test rules from the time of the effectivedate to the end of the data reimbursement period, which may be up to fiveyears after the final test data are required. This approach could cut asmany as 6 years of reporting by industry. This approach remains attractiveto EPA because it does offer a decrease in burden. However, persons subjectto section 12(b) would still be required to submit annual reports untilthe time of the last data submission, and the value of those additionalreports may not be significant over and above the one-time report thatwould be required by the proposed approach.3. EPA also considered establishing a ``percentage'' cutoff from section12(b) reporting triggered by section 4 test rules. In this case, if thesection 4 test rule chemical was present in an exported product at a lowlevel (e.g., 1.0 percent or 0.1 percent), export notification would notbe required. While this alternative may provide exporters of mixtures containingsection 4 chemicals with a modest reduction in reporting burden, EPA believesthat the one-time notification for section 4 chemicals will result in afar greater reduction in reporting burden to industry and in administrationto EPA.4. A final alternative considered by EPA would be to establish a one-timenotification requirement for all actions which trigger section 12(b) notification.Thus, exporters would be required to submit one notice per country foreach chemical subject to a rule, order, action, or relief under section4, 5, 6, or 7 of TSCA. Under this alternative, EPA would provide each importingcountry with one notice per chemical subject to section 12(b) notification.This approach would alleviate burden associated with all activities thattrigger section 12(b) export notification, and would also provide a reductionin reporting burden on industry and a reduction in the administrative burdenon EPA. However, this approach would reduce for all section 12(b) triggeringactivities the total number of notices received by foreign governments.Such a reduction could potentially hamper the ability of foreign governmentsto monitor imports of chemicals for which EPA has proposed or taken regulatoryaction on the basis that they present unreasonable risks.EPA requests comments on the alternatives discussed above. EPA also requeststhat commenters alert EPA to any reasonable alternatives not consideredhere. Before developing the final rule, EPA will consider all commentsand alternatives received with regard to this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Impact</ITAG>EPA has evaluated the potential costs of this proposed amendment to personssubject to section 12(b) reporting requirements. The amendment would reducethe number of submissions sent to EPA from companies exporting chemicalssubject to test rules under TSCA section 4, and would also reduce the numberof notifications sent by EPA to foreign governments. These reductions wouldsave both industry and EPA resources and will be referred to collectivelyas the ``reduction in reporting burden.''The procedure used to estimate the reduction in 1989 reporting burden forindustry is a several step process. First, an estimate of the reductionin industry submissions requires taking the estimated submissions whichwould still be required after promulgation of this proposed rule (2,319to 2,906) and subtracting those values from the base line estimation ofsubmissions under the current reporting scheme (4,667). This decrease isestimated at 1,761 to 2,348 submissions and based upon an estimated industrycost of $10 to $50 per submission, yields a 1989 industry savings of $18,000to $117,000. The net present value of this industry savings from 1989 to1993 is estimated at $114,000 to $759,000 using a 3 percent discount rate,and at $99,000 to $657,000 using a discount rate of 10 percent.EPA resource savings from this proposed rule would occur because the EPAOffice of Toxic Substances (OTS) would handle fewer submissions from industryand would send out fewer notifications to foreign governments. The estimated1989 EPA savings in handling submissions would be the cost of handlinga submission ($5) times the decrease in submissions (1,761 to 2,348), or$9,000 to $12,000. The estimated 1989 EPA savings for sending out fewernotices is the EPA cost per section 12(b) notification sent ($40) timesthe estimated decrease in notifications (770 to 1,014) or $31,000 to $41,000.Thus, by combining these estimates, the overall 1989 EPA savings that wouldbe generated by this proposed rule are estimated at $40,000 ($9,000 + $31,000)to $53,000 ($12,000 + $41,000). The net present value of this overall EPAsavings from 1989 to 1993 is estimated at $256,000 to $331,000 using a3 percent discount rate, and at $222,000 to $287,000 using a 10 percentdiscount rate.By combining the 1989 resource savings to industry ($18,000 to $117,000)with the 1989 resource savings to EPA ($40,000 to $53,000), the total 1989reduction in reporting burden generated by this proposed rule is estimatedat $58,000 to $170,000. The net present value of this total reduction inreporting burden from 1989 to 1993 is estimated at $370,000 to $1,090,000using a 3 percent discount rate, and at $321,000 to $944,000 using a 10percent discount rate.Persons are directed to the record for this rulemaking at the address listedin Unit V. below for the assumptions and detailed calculations used inthe economic analysis for this proposed rule. The analysis contained inthe record also analyzes the economic impacts of alternatives 2 and 4 discussedin Unit III.B. of this preamble.The 1989 industry savings is estimated at $17,000 to $85,000 for alternative2, and $22,000 to $147,000 for alternative 4. The net present value ofthis industry savings from 1989 to 1993 is estimated at $174,000 to $870,000(3 percent discount rate) and at $149,000 to $746,000 (10 percent discountrate) for alternative 2, and at $139,000 to $923,000 (3 percent discountrate) and at $121,000 to $801,000 (10 percent discount rate) for alternative4. The 1989 EPA savings is estimated at $38,000 for alternative 2, andat $49,000 to $66,000 for alternative 4. The net present value of EPA savingsfrom 1989 to 1993 is estimated at $384,000 (3 percent discount rate) and$328,000 (10 percent discount rate) for alternative 2, and at $309,000to $407,000 (3 percent discount rate) and $268,000 to $354,000 (10 percentdiscount rate) for alternative 4.By combining the 1989 resources savings to industry with the 1989 resourcesavings to EPA, the total 1989 reduction in reporting burden generatedby alternative 2 is estimated at $55,000 to $123,000, and at $71,000 to$213,000 for alternative 4. The net present value of this total reductionin reporting burden from 1989 to 1993 is estimated at $558,000 to $1,254,000(3 percent discount rate) and at $477,000 to $1,074,000 (10 percent discountrate) for alternative 2, and at $448,000 to $1,330,000 (3 percent discountrate) and $389,000 to $1,155,000 (10 percent discount rate) for alternative4.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore requires a regulatory impact analysis. EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule would not be a ``major'' rule because it wouldnot have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, and would nothave a significant effect on competition, costs, or prices.This proposed rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses. This rule would decrease the reporting burdenupon small businesses subject to the reporting requirements of TSCA section12(b). This proposed rule would not add any economic burden to small businesses.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisproposed rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and has assigned OMB Control Number 2070-0030.The proposed rule would reduce the number of notices required from thepublic by approximately 1700 to 2300 submissions. Public reporting burdenfor the collection of information under 40 CFR Part 717 is estimated toaverage .5 to 1.5 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Total publicreporting burden is expected to decrease as a result of this proposed ruleby approximately 850 to 3,450 hours (1,700 submissions andmultiply; .5 hoursto 2,300 submissions andmultiply; 1.5 hours).Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: DeskOfficer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public commentson the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 707</ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Exports, Hazardous substances, Imports,Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
