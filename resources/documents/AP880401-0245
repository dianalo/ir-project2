REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The leader of the August coup attemptthat almost toppled the government of President Corazon Aquinoescaped from his prison ship, the military announced Saturday.   A statement said Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan escaped about2:30 a.m. aboard two rubber boats along with 13 other people,including some of his guards.   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a massive search forthe 39-year-old Honasan and alerted subordinate commands nationwideto be on the lookout for him.   Honasan had been detained on a navy ship in Manila Bay since hisarrest last December in a Manila suburb.   One military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidofficers close to Honasan had been ordered to report to militaryChief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa to discuss the case.   The breakout followed rumors in the capital that Honasan wouldattempt to escape.   Honasan, former chief of security at the Defense Ministry,played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, mutiny which triggered thepopular uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.   But Honasan became disillusioned with Marcos' successor,President Corazon Aquino.   On Aug. 28, Honasan led a force of 2,000 men who attacked thepresidential palace and seized several media and militaryinstallations in the capital before they were driven off bypro-Aquino forces.   The coup attempt left 53 people dead and wounded hundreds, andMrs. Aquino said it was aimed at killing her and her family.   Honasan's effort was the most serious of several major plots tounseat Mrs. Aquino's government.   Honasan has accused Mrs. Aquino of ``weak and inept'' leadershipand says he tried to save the country from communism.</TEXT></DOC>
