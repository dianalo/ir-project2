One hundred sequentialpatients are being imaged before and after ESWL by KUB, CR, and DR. Examinationsare independently reviewed by three radiologists. Differences are elicitedby calculating sensitivity, specificity, and by receiver operating characteristicanalysis. Results in 35 patients show improved detection of calculi bytomography versus KUB, with greater differences noted in posttreatmentstudies when calculi are generally smaller. DR appears to be somewhatmore effective than CR.</TEXT></DOC>
