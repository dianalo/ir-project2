Col. Sanam Kajornklam of the Supreme Command's OperationsDivision said the Displaced Persons Protection Unit would beoperating on the Thai-Cambodian border by the end of June.   Sanan said international organizations and Western countriesthat contribute to the Thai refugee relief effort had voicedconcern about abuses by Task Force 80, which since 1980 has been incharge of security for a quarter million Cambodians in camps alongthe border.   The Cambodians fled brutal regimes, food shortages and aguerrilla war in their homeland.   The Western officials ``were concerned and said they would liketo see improvements,'' Sanan said. ``We also wanted to see changesand are responding to that.''   ``By improving our people and increasing our responsibilities,we will be able to provide better security to those inside thecamps,'' Sanan said.   He said the army chief, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and thearmed forces chief of staff, Gen. Sundhara Kongsompong, concludedin October that the paramilitary must be ``upgraded and staffedwith people with caliber.''   The new unit, comprising 560 defense volunteers, is to worktogether with the army and Task Force 80, Sanan said.   The United States, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,voluntary organizations, and the Lawyers' Committee for HumanRights were among those who complained about the task force.   In an influential report issued in February 1987, a delegationfrom the New York-based lawyers' committee said that its tour ofthe border area found ``an alarming incidence'' of abuse by thetask force rangers.   ``Rangers have robbed, beaten and raped the residents of somecamps, with apparent impunity,'' the report said. ``The rangers'conduct has generated an atmosphere of fear even among those whohave not been personally victimized.''   The rangers also have killed some refugees, the report said.   One of the most publicized incidents took place in March 1986,when three task force officers reportedly used a hot iron andburning firewood to torture three Cambodians in the Khao-I-Dangrefugee camp, which is aided by the United Nations. The Cambodianmen were suspected of an armed raid on the camp.   Thai government officials then denied there had been any torture.   Western aid officials working on the border say that there havebeen fewer reported abuses by task force rangers in recent months.</TEXT></DOC>
