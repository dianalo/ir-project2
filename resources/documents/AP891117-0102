Population Fund.   He said the slippage will accelerate following the militarycrackdown on pro-democracy dissent in June, and ``there will be asignificant slowing down in the program.''   Laquian said Chinese officials have become more bureaucratic andcautious since then, requesting documents in triplicate for mattersthat previously could be handled over the telephone.   He said the new government's stress on central planning has hadan effect, citing the case of a U.N.-funded contraceptive factoryin the coastal city of Tianjin that had to close down because ithadn't received a production target from Beijing.   ``They can't buy materials and can't hire,'' Laquian said, withthe result that more than $1 million in U.N.-supplied equipment wasstanding idle.   He said some contraceptive factories were working only threedays a week because the government austerity program has cut themoff from raw materials and foreign exchange needed for imports usedin production.   Laquian said the problems have not yet changed long-termprospects for China's population, which the U.N. predicts will growfrom more than 1.1 billion at present to 1.285 billion in the year2000.   He said the U.N. estimate could be low. Chinese officials, whooriginally hoped to hold the population to 1.2 billion, acknowledgeit could go as high as 1.3 billion in 2000 due to missteps in theplanning program.   Laquian said China's ability to reduce the natural growth ratefrom 2.4 percent to 1.4 percent in the past decade has been a``fantastic accomplishment.'' But he said the program, based on theone-child-per-family principle, has run into serious problems since1985.   A major factor in the rise in births in recent years is that the360 million people born between 1962 and 1976 have reachedchild-bearing age.   Among other problems were the success of economic reforms,giving peasants the money to pay fines for having extra children; a``floating population'' of up to 50 million migrant workers who aremore difficult to monitor; a more sexually active young population;and a breakdown in social and health services with the dismantlingof the communes.   The health system ``is in disarray and deteriorating'' since1985 because of the lack of a coordinated welfare system, Laquiansaid. ``Barefoot doctors are leaving the profession in droves. Theycan earn more raising chickens and pigs.''   Another shortcoming is the poor quality of contraceptivesproduced in China, he said. Intra-uterine devices used by 52million women in China have a 10 percent failure rate, one reasonwhy there were 12.68 million abortions last year, more than one forevery two live births.   Laquian also pointed to the relaxation of the one-child policysince 1985, with some 19 different kinds of exemptions, includingpermission for rural families whose first child is a girl to tryagain for a boy.   But he said that eight Chinese provinces experimenting withtwo-child policies rather than insisting on one child per couplehave received more cooperation and obtained better results.   Laquian said a five-year U.S. boycott on funding for the U.N.program because of concern the money would contribute to forcedabortions has affected the political image of the program but hasnot caused economic hardships.   The organization's budget has risen from $136 million in 1985,when the United States was the biggest donor with $36 million, to$180 million in 1990 as a result of increased contributions fromJapan and Europe.   About $10 million a year goes to China for contraceptiveproduction, maternal and child health care, population research andeducational programs.   Laquian said the Chinese government officially opposes forcedabortion, but with 190,000 family planning workers and 13 millionvolunteers and pressure from Beijing for good results, ``it's veryeasy for local party officials to be overzealous.''   He said female infanticide among peasants wanting sons appearedto be ``very negligible'' although there was a tendency for girlinfants, who are regarded as less important than males, to beneglected in breast-feeding and health care.   Laquian said China's ability to feed one-fifth of the world'spopulation has been a great contribution to mankind, but that Chinacould lose that ability if it has 1.3 billion mouths to feed at theend of the century, 100 million more than the original goal.   ``That would be the first dam to break,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
