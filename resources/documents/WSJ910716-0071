But when he hauls it in 2 1/2 hours later, it holds just350 pounds of fish-half of what he would have caught in theearly 1980s. As usual, the net has swallowed almost no largecodfish and flounder. Many fish have barely reached the legalminimum size for keeping. As for haddock, one of the mostprized species in these onceteeming waters, not a one is tobe found.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I used to catch a lot of haddock, thousands of pounds ayear of haddock,&quot; laments Mr. Mirarchi, 47 years old, acommercial fisherman for 28 years. &quot;Now I catch three or fourfish in a year -- 25 pounds.&quot;   Where have all the fish gone? Mostly, they have beencaught -- and over a period so ominously short that thefuture of one of America's oldest industries is threatened.   Only 14 years ago, the U.S. declared a 200-mile boundaryaround its shores, banning most foreign trawlers that hadplundered America's waters. It was, proponents said, the onlyway to save beleaguered New England fishermen.   It worked, until Americans themselves began overfishing.The region's fishermen went on a boat-building binge,encouraged in part by a federal loan program. They equippedthe new trawlers with powerful fish-finding electronics. Theylobbied hard to get timid bureaucrats to remove quotas oncatches. And, for a while, they caught a lot more fish.   But the trawler catch in New England peaked in 1983 andhas since fallen sharply. Stocks of flounder and haddock arenear record lows. The cod population is down. Bluefin tunaand swordfish have been depleted.   Many New England fishermen find themselves in direstraits, victims of a getit-while-you-can mentality thatcould exhaust stocks beyond recovery. There have been boomsand busts before, as ports such as New Bedford andGloucester, Mass., grew over the centuries from colonialtowns into bustling commercial centers. But scientists saythat this time is different, because the fleets are so bigand the technology so good that fish no longer have anywhereto hide.   &quot;It's greed, 90% of it is greed -- the future looks verydim,&quot; says Marty Manley, a scallop-boat owner in New Bedford,the fabled whaling town described in Melville's &quot;Moby Dick.&quot;   Fish stocks are under pressure elsewhere, too. Off thecoast of Alaska, where quotas already are in place, thegovernment may limit the take of a growing fleet of hugefactory trawlers. In the Gulf of Mexico, the once-abundantred snapper have been overfished. Swordfish, prized for theirhigh price, have been decimated in the Atlantic. In thePacific, some Asian boats fish illegally with vast driftnets, some 30 to 40 miles long, that snare millions of youngsalmon.   So a chorus for conservation is arising. &quot;With morepowerful boats and fish finders, we basically have thecapacity to wipe fish out, and we are,&quot; warns Douglas Foy,executive director of the Conservation Law Foundation, whichrecently sued to force the federal government to adopt a planto rebuild fish stocks in the Northeast. Even some fishermen,a hardy and independent lot suspicious of outsideinterference, have joined the call.   But the battle promises to be bitter, especially in NewEngland, where the problem is perhaps the most acute.Fishermen crowd public meetings, berating bureaucrats overproposed conservation measures. They also bombard electedofficials with letters opposing limits on their catches.Straining to pay off mortgages on expensive boats, manyfishermen say they don't have the luxury of not catching asmuch as they can as fast as they can.   &quot;What are you saving the fish for? For who?&quot; asks Ed Lima,director of a fishermen's group in Gloucester, Mass., whoworries about measures that might cost fishermen their jobs.&quot;Where does conservation stop? Where does it end?&quot;   Indeed, some fishermen deny that overfishing is theproblem. Some contend that the decline is part of a naturalcycle, and that stocks will rise again naturally. Othersblame pollution, even though that doesn't explain theswelling population of species like skate and dogfish thatAmericans don't eat and fishermen avoid catching. All saythat part of the drop in catches resulted from a World Courtdecision in 1984 awarding Canada a favored portion of thefertile Georges Bank fishing grounds.   Things weren't supposed to turn out this way. When theU.S. set the 200-mile boundary for foreigners in 1977, it washailed as the savior of the New England fishery. But U.S.fishermen quickly filled the vacuum. Accelerating the movewas a rise in prices as health-conscious Americans turnedless to beef and more to fish. From 590 vessels in 1976, theNew England groundfishing fleet -- trawlers that fish forspecies that live on the ocean floor -- grew by more thantwo-thirds, to more than 1,000, in the early 1980s.   At this point, critics say, fishery managers made a fatalmistake. The New England Fishery Management Council -- one ofseven regional bodies made up largely of fishing industryrepresentatives, appointed by the Department of Commerce --caved in to pressure from fishermen and lifted catch quotasand trip limits in 1982. A 1990 report by Massachusetts saysthe action &quot;received considerable criticism . . . that itwould lead to overfishing because it set no direct controlson fishing mortality. Those predictions of overfishing havenow been borne out.&quot;   In 1983, the trawler catch reached 410 million pounds(mostly groundfish such as cod, flounder and haddock), up 66%from 1976. In 1990, though, the haul declined to 282 millionpounds. While up from the low of 234 million pounds in 1989,marine scientists say the increase was achieved by catchinghuge numbers of juvenile fish that have just reached theminimum size. That bodes ill, because many of those fishhadn't yet had a chance to spawn.   A day fishing with Mr. Mirarchi, an inshore day fishermanwho stays within about 20 miles of his home harbor inScituate, Mass., underscores the problem.   &quot;We're fishing them out faster than they're reproducing,&quot;says Mr. Mirarchi, sorting the fish he has hauled up from theocean floor 300 feet below onto the deck of the Christopher andamp;Andrew (named after his sons). &quot;All the codfish we catch arethe same age. They're like peas in a pod; they're the samesize. There are practically no adult fish here.&quot;   He picks up a 22-inch gray sole (a type of flounder), andsays, &quot;Years ago, this is the kind that were relativelycommon, 40% to 50% of your catch.&quot; But most of the flounderare much smaller, many right around the 13- to 14-inchminimum, and Mr. Mirarchi explains: &quot;A big fish spawns fourtimes in its life. A 14-inch fish has a 50% chance of havingspawned once.&quot;   His boat, purchased in 1976, is rusting in spots andshowing its age. But he has plenty of electronics, includinga depth finder that displays an image of the sea bed inbrilliant colors on a video screen. Radio signals can guidethe boat to within 50 feet of a previous good catch, andenable him to fish near rocky bottoms or wrecks that he hadto avoid in the past for fear of tearing up expensive nets.   &quot;We used to set buoys {as landmarks}, five-gallon oilbuckets,&quot; Mr. Mirarchi says, recalling his early days infishing. &quot;Do we have better tools? Yes, and they're available24 hours a day, good weather or bad. Fish have no sanctuaryof space or time.&quot;   Until 18 months ago, Mr. Mirarchi went to sea with two mento help him fish. Because catches have declined so much, hedropped one crewman. There are barely enough fish to supporthim and a helper, he says. Mr. Mirarchi bought his boat 15years ago and has managed to pay off his mortgage but stillmakes only $25,000 fishing about 200 days a year, down 50%from the mid-1980s. &quot;If I had a mortgage, I'd be fishing dayand night,&quot; says Mr. Mirarchi, who recently was named to theNew England fishery council.   Others have been forced to bail out. Joseph Brancaleone,41, whose father and grandfather were fishermen, sold thefamily boat several years ago and became a manager at aBurger King restaurant in Gloucester. &quot;We were dipping intoour pockets to make ends meet,&quot; he says. After seeing hiscatch decline, Bruce Barnard of Falmouth, Mass., on Cape Cod,recently sold the 100-foot trawler that he bought in themid-1980s for $200,000 and had spent another $200,000refurbishing. His asking price: $300,000. His sale price?&quot;Less than half that,&quot; he says.   Foreclosure auctions have become fairly common. There hasalso been a series of suspicious sinkings of apparentlyseaworthy boats, whose owners collected insurance.   Richard Tobin, who has fished part-time for tuna for yearsout of Newburyport, Mass., is trying to sell his boat. On 20day-trips a year, he used to catch one tuna or better a day,many of 600 pounds or more. But as Japanese buyers bid up theprice in recent years, hundreds of tuna boats flooded NewEngland waters. Using spotter planes and electric harpoons,they chase tuna with deadly accuracy. &quot;The tuna are doomed,&quot;laments Mr. Tobin, who caught but a single tuna last year.&quot;They're too valuable to live. They'll {be fished} toextinction.&quot;   In New Bedford, home of the region's scalloping fleet, ahandful of trawlers have begun working almost round theclock. Returning to port after a 10- or 12-day trip, theyunload, resupply and head out to sea in as little as sixhours with a fresh crew. Why? &quot;To make more money,&quot; ArneIsaksen, a scallop boat owner, says flatly. &quot;Most bigbusinesses you invest your money in, you run 24 hours. Wedidn't see any reason to stay in&quot; the traditional six days torest.   While scallop stocks are relatively healthy, they won't befor long, critics say. &quot;These back-to-back trips are rapingthe resource,&quot; contends Howard Nickerson, head of theOffshore Mariners Association and a proponent of restrictionson scallop boats.   Likewise, Steven Murawski, a scientist for the NationalMarine Fisheries Service, says that many of the yellowtailflounder being caught now are part of an unusually strong&quot;year class&quot; born in 1987 but that few are left to spawnfuture generations. &quot;We flubbed it,&quot; by not having strictercatch limits, he says.   But many fishermen say they can't back off. &quot;I used tocatch 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of fish for a two- or three-daytrip. Now, the basic three-day trip is 15,000 pounds,&quot; saysRussell Wilkinson, a Point Judith, R.I., fisherman who isstruggling to keep up with payments on his $250,000, 76-foottrawler. &quot;We have to keep the boat going nonstop.&quot;   Mr. Mirarchi says: &quot;The majority of fishermen are caughtup in a rat race that tells them, `If you don't get it now,somebody else will.'&quot;   Joseph Testaverde, a Gloucester fisherman, complains that&quot;when the 200-mile limit came in, the government said,invest, capitalize, get bigger, get better. Now we're toobig, and they say go the other way.&quot;   But other fishermen and conservationists insist thatcurrent measures -- minimum net mesh sizes and occasionalclosures of overfished waters -- simply aren't enough. Strictcatch quotas, trip limits, even a moratorium on new boats,are needed, or more will be forced out of the business in thelong run. Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.) yesterday proposedlegislation to reduce the size of the New England fleet bybuying out vessels with money from a tax on diesel fuel thefishing boats use.   &quot;I used to be strongly opposed to any kind of limitedentry in fisheries,&quot; says Dick Allen, vice president of theAtlantic Offshore Fish Association in Newport, R.I. &quot;But I'vecome to feel we have to have some way of rationallyallocating fishery resources just as we do other resources.&quot;   That's fine, says Mr. Lima, of Gloucester, if thegovernment will aid ailing fishermen. &quot;Why can't thegovernment subsidize this fleet? You don't fish this amountof days, and we'll meet your mortgage,&quot; he says. &quot;They do itfor tobacco farmers and farmers all over the country -- whydon't they do it for us?&quot;   Whatever the solution, Mr. Mirarchi hopes something isdone: &quot;We're fiddling while Rome burns. . . . I'd like thereto be some fish if my son wants to fish.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
