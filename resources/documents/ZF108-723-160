FROM:  Stewart Alsop, P. C Letter RE:The Japanese market Dear Rod:andM;I see from articles in the Japanese business press that you are planning toopen a subsidiary in Tokyo next month and introduce computers into thatmarket in 1991.andP;  This is an interesting proposition, not least because Compaqseems to have a magic touch.andP;  You have built a $2 billion business in theU.S.andP;  in seven years without making any major boo-boos.andP;  More recently, youhave created a  1+ billion business in Europe in about three years, alsowithout making any major boo-boos.andP;  This year, you appear to have finallycracked the problem of the laptop and instantly taken leadership in themarket.andP;  And now you are going to tackle the toughest market in the world,one in which only three U.S.andP;  companies - IBM, Apple, and AST Research - haveeven tried to sell PCs.andP;  The notion that you might be able to export yourmagic touch to the very market that Americans fear the most is a very sexynotion indeed.andM;But before you cast your plans for Japan in stone, let me share with you aperspective that I think is instructive.andP;  I know that you have been unable tofathom most of my ramblings about Compaq's product strategy, particularlysince I believe that any major manufacturer should put more effort into thedesign of system software than into engineering the hardware.andP;  But on thesubject of the Japanese market, I think we might actually follow the samereasoning.andP;  Indeed, I believe that the Japanese market is ready made for theunique Compaq approach to customers and products.andM;You have been very, very successful in Europe by exporting the same basicstrategy you have employed in the U.S.andP;  - make IBM-compatible computers thatare faster, more functional, and more compatible than IBM's own computers andsell them exclusively through independent resellers.andP;  So the question arises:Should you export your U.S.andP;  strategy once again, or do you need afundamentally different strategy for Japan? To give you a quick answer, Ithink you should export the strategy, but modify it to recognize asignificant difference in the Japanese market - IBM did not set the standardin Japan, as it did in both the U.S.andP;  and Europe.andM;Two years ago, I wrote about how I thought that the Japanese marketrepresented a unique market opportunity for an American company.andP;  (See  JapanReport: Wanted: One Smart, Patient American Computer Company,&quot; Issue 4.03,02-12-88.) In that article, I proposed that - because of Japanese businesspractices - an opportunity existed for an American company to help expand theJapanese market for PCs by cloning the NEC 9800 architecture.andP;  Thefundamental notion was that customers had already chosen a standardarchitecture - the NEC 9800 series - and were buying more of thatarchitecture than any other.andP;  In other words, NEC had set the standard injapan in 1983, much as IBM had set the standard in the U.S.andP;  in 1981.andP;  (Itset a slightly different standard.andP;  The NEC 9800 uses Intel processors andMS-DOS, but has a different BIOS, graphics controller, 1/0 bus, andkeyboard.) But business practices have stopped the other Japanese computermanufacturers from cloning the NEC architecture (as Compaq and others clonedthe IBM architecture in the U.S.), primarily because NEC didn't want them tomake such machines.andP;  So every other computer manufacturer has introducedtheir own architecture (some based on the Intel-DOS combination, some not).andO;The opportunity was to bring American business practices (i.e.andP;  using thedefinition of 100% compatibility pioneered by your company in 1983) intojapan and apply them to the NEC architecture for the benefit of Japanesecustomers and software developers.andP;  The advantage that an American companyhas is precisely that it isn't constrained by the japanese custom of workingwith competitors to manage marketplaces.andM;Since 1988, the situation has not fundamentally changed.andP;  NEC still sellshalf of the personal computers sold in Japan.andP;  Both Fujitsu and IBM Japan,because of their substantial mainframe businesses, still have measurable PCbusinesses (with 10% and 8% of the total market respectively) but mostly byselling their own machines directly to their large customers.andP;  And the restof the business is chaos, as afl of the other manufacturers have tried tocompete for the remaining 30% of a relatively small market.andP;  Indeed, the sizeof the Japanese market for personal computers has not changed substantiallyeither.andP;  In 1987, about 1.1 million machines were sold, in 1988 about 1.2million, and in 1989 about 1.3 million, a growth rate of less than 10%.andP;  (Andthe Japanese market is only about 20% the size of the U.S.andP;  market eventhough the population is 75% and the economy is about 85% the size of theU.S.)andM;Based on the most recent market-share figures for 1989, the composition ofthe market is almost exactly the same as it was when I wrote that article in1988: Brand  Share  Units NEC  50.3  650,000 Fujitsu  13.7  178,000 Toshiba12.5  163,000 Epson  8  104,000 IBM Japan  7.8  101,000 Other  7.7  100,000Total  100  1,300,000andM;There have been two shifts in the market-share column, one of which issignificant to this article and supports my basic thesis.andP;  The first shift isthat laptops have become a much larger and more important segment of theJapanese market much faster than they have in the U.S., so that a third ofthe PCs sold in Japan are now laptops where only one in ten or one in eightsold in the U.S.andP;  are laptops.andP;  That shift is important for your productplanning in japan, since the japanese have a real space problem both at homeand at work.andP;  So big machines just don't sell as well.andP;  But it doesn't changethe fundamental dynamics about what customers are saying how they want theircomputers to work.andP;  The second, and more important, shift is that the marketshare of NEC-compatible computers has increased substantially.andP;  Epson is theone manufacturer in Japan that makes an NEC 9800-compatible computer.andP;  (Toexplain, Epson is historically not a computer manufacturer, but a watch andinstrument maker.andP;  So it wasn't constrained in its decision to confront NECwith a compatible by its membership in the computer industry andrelationships to NEC's other computer operations.) Since introducing itsfirst NEC, compatible computer in December, 1987, it has developed an entireproduct line of compatibles and has created a significant computer businessthat it now fourth only to NEC, Fujitsu, and Toshiba.andP;  And the NECarchitecture now accounts for 60% of the computers sold in the market.andP;  Inpolitics, 60% of the vote is called a landside.andP;  If the PC market were apolitical vote, then, it is clear that Japanese customers want NEC andNEC-compatible machines by a landslide margin.andP;  (Other notes: 1) I haven'texplained the Toshiba market share, primarily because I believe that themajority of these sales are of IBM-compatible laptops to japanese tradingcompanies for export to other Asian markets, which are largelyIBM-compatible.andP;  As such, they aren't relevant to the Japanese market.andP;  2)Apple is wildly successful in japan, according to a recent Business Weekarticle.andP;  That's stretching it.andP;  Apple is supposed to be selling about3,000-4,000 units a month in Japan, which is not much more than what it wasselling two years ago and still isn't enough to give it a significant shareof the market.)andM;What's ironic, in my mind, is that the very fact that the other manufacturershaven't been willing to sell NEC-compatible computers is actually holdingback growth of personal computing in japan.andP;  You and I know, Rod, that onceyou had proven in the U.S.andP;  that customers wanted 100% compatibility  definedin real terms as the ability to use any software or add-in cards developedfor the standard and to gain the assurance that if one manufacturer didn'tsupply the right kind of machine, another would), the market grew atpreviously unheard-of rates, in one year in excess of 100%.andP;  japanesecustomers have never been offered that kind of compatibility.andP;  Just go intoany Japanese computer store that carries software and try to figure out whichtitle works on which machines, even if you speak and read the language!)andO;Sure, Epson offers a product line that is compatible with NEC'S, but there isno inherent competition to make the market grow since there is clearly nomovement for other manufacturers to follow suit.andP;  And therein lies theopportunity in Japan - to segment the japanese market the way the U.S.andO;market has been segmented.andM;That's what I mean by saying that you should export your strategy.andP;  You builtyour business on the premise that you could offer a computer that used thesame software and hardware enhancements as the standard, but that performedbetter than the standard, and to sell that product through the indirectdistribution channel.andP;  So accept the standard in Japan - the NEC 9800 - butimprove on it.andP;  Implement your Flex architecture in an NEC-compatible machineso that you decouple the 1/0 bus from the processor and memory and can make aclear difference in performance.andP;  Then put one or two highperformance,NEC-compatible computers on the market, price it at about the same level asthe equivalent NEC machine, and sell it through the same channels that NECand Epson already use.andP;  That would give you a clearly differentiatedposition: faster than NEC and better quality than Epson (which has chosen togo head-to-head with NEC's product line, but price its own machines 15%lower).andP;  And I would be willing to bet that you will be surprised how fastJapanese retailers will take on an American product, if their customers wantit.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
