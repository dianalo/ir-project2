This report provides background excerpted from manyreferences used in the development of a multitier specification thatidentifies five levels of enhancement. (The multitier specification ispresented in a separate report.) The report describes the nuclear environmentfor surface and in-atmosphere bursts outside of the blast region, wherebuildings and personnel would be expected to survive. In the environment,the vulnerability of optical fiber waveguides to fallout radiation isa primary concern. An assessment of fiber darkening, based on a reviewof unclassified literature, is presented. For exo-atmospheric nuclearbursts, the fiber optic system is exposed to High Altitude electromagneticpulse (HEMP) radiation. Unclassified levels of these nuclear effectshave been obtained from published literature. The characteristics offuture generations of optical-fiber systems, as described in currentliterature, are outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
