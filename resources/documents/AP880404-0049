Caniff, the comic strip artist whopitted square-jawed Americans against treacherous dragon ladies in``Terry and the Pirates'' and ``Steve Canyon,'' died Sunday at age81.   He began his career drawing ``Dickie Dare'' and ``The GayThirties'' for The Associated Press. But it was with ``Terry andthe Pirates,'' which he started in 1934 for the New York DailyNews, that he made his mark on adventure cartooning.   By 1946, Caniff was making $75,000 per year and ``Terry and thePirates'' was in more than 300 newspapers.
