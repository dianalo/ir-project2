Barricada, mouthpiece of the leftist government party, based itsreport on unidentified sources ``in national political circles'' inHonduras.   The U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the Contras, as theguerrillas are known, in February 1988 but continued humanitarianaid, which runs out at the end of this month.   President Bush has said he will ask Congress to extend thenon-lethal assistance to the Contras, about 11,000 of which areliving in jungle camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border withthousands of relatives.   ``U.S. helicopters and pilots taking part in the `Ahuas Tara 89'joint military maneuvers in Honduran territory are supplying armsand ammunition to the Contra forces,'' Barricada said in afront-page article.   It said weapons shipments leave from the Tocontin, Palmerola andIsla del Cisne (Swan Island) air force bases to Contra camps inYamales and Mokoron.   According to Barricada, the operations involving five U.S.helicopters started in mid-February. It said the helicopters areUH-1H and Bell-212 models.   Barricada said shipments have been made also using DC-6 cargoplanes from private company whose stockholders, the paper said, areHonduran military officers.   The Honduran-U.S. maneuvers began in late January and arescheduled through July and involve about 3,000 U.S. and Honduranmilitary personnel. They are largely command and constructionexercises.</TEXT></DOC>
