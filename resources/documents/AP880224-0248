Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., ranking minority member of the SenateCommerce, Science and Transportation Committee, made the request inthe wake of an incident involving a TMI train in the St. Louis areaearlier this month.   Herrington took the senator's request under consideration, aDanforth aide said.   The Federal Railroad Administration confirmed on Wednesday it isinvestigating a rail car switching incident on Feb. 9 just before aTMI train passed through St. Louis. The agency is determiningwhether there were violations of rail regulations, which could drawcivil penalties of up to $10,000.   The train was carrying casks of radioactive wastes from thedamaged TMI plant in Pennsylvania to a government laboratory inIdaho.   Bill Loftus, an FRA spokesman, said the possible violationsinvolve mislabeling of a covered hopper car, which was added to theTMI train in a railyard in East St. Louis, Ill.   The car carried a placard stating that it contained a flammablematerial, but later was found not to be carrying the dangerouscargo.   Loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violationsby the rail switching yard, the Union Pacific Railroad whichoperated the train after it left the yard and a lime company thatwas shipping the car.   Federal rail regulations, Loftus said, require shippers toproperly label goods being moved by rail. Regulations also prohibitswitching yards from offering mislabeled cars for addition to atrain and railroads from transporting any improperly labeledfreight.   Herrington met on Wednesday with Danforth and several othersenators from states along the TMI rail route. The Missourian wantsthe Energy Department to halt the waste shipments until theTransportation Department can study the rail route used by theEnergy Department to move the materials to the laboratory in IdahoFalls, Idaho.   Since the shipments began in 1986, Missouri officials havecomplained that the government's route takes the radioactivematerials through densely populated cities such as St. Louis.</TEXT></DOC>
