(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gerald ``Jinks'' Parker just can'tunderstand how he could be facing a $5,000 fine and five years inprison on charges of selling parts of the black bears he killedlegally.   ``I'm selling m'guns,'' said Parker, 37. ``I'm selling m'dogs. Ijust can't afford it no more. ... This just don't make no sense.''   Parker, whose ancestors were Cherokee Indians, lives on theCherokee Indian Reservation, at the edge of the Great SmokyMountains National Park.   All animals in the park, including wild boar, birds and bears,are protected from hunting.   Parker and 34 others were arrested on federal charges of killingor selling black bear in North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia,culminating a three-year undercover investigation of poaching inthe Appalachians.   Some of those arrested are charged with shooting bears in theSmoky Mountains Park. Some are charged with hunting outside of theannual six-week season. Still others, like Parker, were charged notwith an illegal kill but violating a law that prohibits the sale ofany part of a black bear, even one killed legally.   That puzzles Parker.   ``If I shoot a bear, should I just let it rot in the woods?''Parker asked. ``Why can't I just sell it to feed my dogs, pay forgas?''   Parker and others with deep roots in the Appalachians have oftenfound themselves at odds with those who protect wildlife over anact that is second nature to them: hunting.   Independent mountain folk often distrust central authority,especially when laws conflict with family and community traditions,said Curtis W. Wood, a history professor at Western CarolinaUniversity in Cullowhee.   ``With some of them, I don't think you can talk of this as ageneral disregard'' for the law, Wood said. ``For some, it ishonest disagreement.''   Thomas L. Bennett, a special agent with the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, rode with a federal marshal in the unsuccessfulsearch for Parker, who surrendered the next day.   ``It's a passion for these people,'' Bennett said. ``It's amacho thing, too. Many of these guys like the thrill of killingsomething, anything. And, because their family did it on the landbefore them, it's their right, too.''   The black bear, the smallest in the bear family, typically is 5feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Its head and feet make forstartling trophies; its hide can be used as a rug or wall-hanging;claws can become part of a necklace.   Bear meat is a staple for many mountain residents and can bringa couple of dollars a pound. But in recent years, it is the bear'sgall bladder that has proved the most lucrative enticement forkilling the animal.   On the Oriental market, powdered bear bladder can bring $540 anounce or more. The powder, diluted with liquor, is believed to makean aphrodisiac.   Bennett said that following last week's poacher roundup he hasgotten calls from people who wanted to surrender rather than riskarrest.   ``We'll never stop it completely,'' he said. ``But we can put adent in it.''</TEXT></DOC>
