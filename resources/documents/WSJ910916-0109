Although demographic shifts slightly favor theRepublicans, the Democrats have sizable advantages in thelegislative bodies that in most cases perform the sensitivejob of redrawing the nation's political boundaries. TheDemocrats control both legislative houses in 30 states, withthe Republicans controlling both houses in only five states-- mostly small ones that together account for only 13 seatsin Congress.</LP><TEXT>   But the Republicans have taken the offensive in a processthat in the past often made them hapless victims. &quot;They'rehaving more successes,&quot; says Kim Brace, president of ElectionData Services, a political-consulting firm that specializesin redistricting issues. &quot;They've done a lot more planning.They're organized, while the Democrats are still kind offloundering around. And this time they know the rules of thegame and are using them for their advantage.&quot;   Clever maneuvers by Republican governors are revivingRepublican hopes in South Carolina and California, bothstates with Democratic-controlled legislatures. By the luckof the draw of names from a hand-blown crystal bowl earlierthis month, a Republican will head up the commission toredraw district lines in Illinoisthereby negating theDemocrats' dominance in the General Assembly. Democraticefforts to squeeze their nemesis, House Republican Whip NewtGingrich, out of Congress may have backfired, endangeringDemocratic lawmakers in Georgia. And Republicans are poisedto profit in Ohio and Michigan, both of which lose two seatsin the House next year.   &quot;Demographic changes and strict redistricting requirementshave helped the Republicans avoid overwhelming gerrymandersagainst them,&quot; says Earl Bender, a Democratic redistrictingconsultant. &quot;It is a big difference from the last time.&quot;   Of all these exercises in political cartography, the mostimportant is California, which is to add seven new Houseseats and to draw lines for 52 districts -- the biggestcongressional delegation in history. Though both statelegislative houses are controlled by the Democrats,Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has mounted a shrewdcounteroffensive that diminishes the Democrats' upper hand.   By appointing an independent redistricting panel, Mr.Wilson is positioned to take advantage of a legislativestalemate -- not out of the question -- or to react to a planthat he finds so unacceptable that he must veto it. TheRepublican governor could then go to the California SupremeCourt and ask it to take jurisdiction -- and unlike the past,the governor would have an alternative plan in hand thatwould have some political legitimacy.   &quot;It's absolutely a brilliant move on his part,&quot; saysMartin Fricks, assistant director of the Sacramento Center ofthe University of Southern California and the paneladministrator. &quot;The court will have this independent panel'splan as an alternative. We are putting together a plan freeof partisan interest that will be near ready to go.&quot;   But even before its plan is completed, the independentcommission is playing a role in the process. The mereknowledge that the governor this time has not only a veto butanother card to play has changed the political dynamic. &quot;Thecommission was a way of creating more political power {forGov. Wilson} than he would have had only with the formal useof the veto,&quot; says Alan Heslop, a professor of government atClaremont-McKenna College in California who has been activein GOP redistricting efforts in the past.   Experts on redistricting agree that the process isimmensely important, but they caution that the effects of theprocess each decade are seldom as great as the passions itgenerates. &quot;The new reality may be that partisanship doesn'tmatter that much,&quot; says William O'Hare, director ofpopulation and policy research at the University ofLouisville in Kentucky. &quot;It may be more important that thecountry is becoming more suburban than the idea thatRepublicans are doing well here and there.&quot;   The Democrats, to be sure, have had their successes aswell, particularly in Oklahoma, Indiana and Alabama. In Iowa,Democratic Rep. Dave Nagle and freshman GOP Rep. Jim Nusslehave been thrown together in one district, with Mr. Nagle, aformer state party chairman, the favorite. But Democraticsuccesses in North Carolina and Texas almost certainly willbe challenged in court.   &quot;Democrats can't comply with the Voting Rights Act andprotect their white incumbents, and when given the choicebetween enfranchising racial minority groups and protectingwhite incumbents, they've gone with the white incumbentsevery time,&quot; says Benjamin Ginsberg, chief counsel of theRepublican National Committee and architect of a strategy toally the GOP with groups citing the Voting Rights Act intheir drive to create minority districts.   Federal law now requires the creation of a majority blackor Hispanic district if possible in areas of raciallypolarized voting -- a development that has the ironic resultof increasing pressure on Democratic lawmakers.   &quot;The Democrats are in a hard place, because to draw theminority districts . . . they have to write out their own{incumbent} members,&quot; says Martha Farnsworth Riche, directorof policy studies at the Population Reference Bureau. &quot;TheRepublicans can just sit back and watch it happen.&quot;   The ethnic factor makes for ironic twists. In Colorado, aDemocratic redistricting plan slightly boosts the Hispaniccomponent of a Western Slope district, reshapes it into aneastern-plains district, makes it far more competitive forRepublicans -- and endangers the re-election of DemocraticRep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Cheyenne who is the onlyIndian in the House.   Courts are increasingly becoming an important forum in theredistricting battle. Besides challenges on the Voting RightsAct, court action will resolve one of the important disputesgrowing out of the 1990 census, the debate in California,Texas, New York and elsewhere over whether to adjust theheadcount for those who didn't file census forms or who weremissed by census takers.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher ruled in July that, inkeeping with Census Bureau tradition, the government wouldn'tadjust its figures in response to a widely acknowledgedundercount. But many areas are pressing to have the adjustedcensus numbers released for use in redistricting.   Using the adjusted figures would help Democrats becausethe new figures would boost the number of minorities -- mostof them Democrats -- and decrease the impact of Republicangains in the suburbs. &quot;If adjusted census numbers are used,&quot;says Prof. Heslop of Claremont-McKenna College, &quot;it's a wholenew ball game.&quot;   California lawmakers wanted to use the revised census datafor their redistricting, but the figures probably won't beavailable there until next year, if at all. The impact couldbe the addition of as many as a million people, andCalifornia Democrats are even contemplating using the figuresin 1994.   The dispute over the revised census figures underlines thetentative nature of solutions to redistricting disputes: Evenwhen lawmakers and governors have completed their work, theissue isn't completely resolved. &quot;There's going to be a lotmore hooting and hollering before we're done,&quot; says Ms.Riche.</TEXT></DOC>
