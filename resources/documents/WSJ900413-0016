During Mr. Cyert's 17-year tenure, the Pittsburgh schoolhas tapped Digital Equipment Corp., Eastman Kodak Co.,International Business Machines Corp., Westinghouse ElectricCorp. and many others. In the process, Carnegie Mellon'sresearch budget grew at one of the fastest rates of any U.S.university -- to $121 million in the 1988-89 academic yearfrom $13 million when Mr. Cyert became president in 1972.</LP><TEXT>   But lately, Mr. Cyert says, Carnegie Mellon has turnedmore to foreign companies -- even in projects originallymeant to give the U.S. a boost. In June, Mr. Cyert plans tostep down as president to return to Carnegie Mellon'sfaculty, as head of an institute to study internationalmanagement. In a recent interview with staff reporter GaryPutka, he faulted both business management and businessschools for some of the country's competitive ills. Here arehighlights:                                                                                                          How has U.S. competitiveness changed in the years thatyou've been leading Carnegie Mellon?   There have been two phases. Up to about the last fiveyears, there hasn't been any question but that Americancompetitiveness has been going downhill. Over the last fiveyears there are signs we're moving in a better direction.   Part of the blame goes to universities. Before World WarII, we had industrial-engineering departments. They taughtthings like time-and-motion studies and plant layout. Whilethey weren't strong academic departments, they turned out alot of people who thought of their job as improving themanufacturing process.   Business schools came along at the end of World War II andstarted using a lot of mathematical techniques, and theydrove these industrial engineering departments out ofexistence. Then business schools began to concentrate onmarketing and finance. So for a long time there were very fewpeople being turned out who viewed themselves asmanufacturing people. The Japanese, on the contrary, turn outscads of industrial engineers, and they don't have very manybusiness schools. As a former dean of a business school Idon't like to say that, but there's a big element there thathas hurt us.                                                                                                          What are the hopeful signs?   A lot of schools have gotten interested in manufacturing.Business schools are joining more closely with theengineering schools in trying to develop programs. Firms aregetting more interested in manufacturing. In the past, when afirm came around recruiting, {students} interested inmanufacturing would get much lower salaries. That's changing.   We see companies like Ford that are really interested inimproving quality and the cost of manufacturing automobiles.There's a larger amount of research dollars coming into theuniversities that has manufacturing implications.                                                                                                          Are foreign corporations ahead of U.S. companies inrecognizing the value of American university research?   I believe they are. They have a better feel for being ableto read something and transfer that knowledge toapplications. If you go into a Japanese operation, you'llfind as much as two to three hours a day is spent bysupervisors and others in production in reading the journalsand trying to get ideas that can be applied. Almost everyidea they have adopted has been in the academic literature.The same thing is true of the Germans.   The second point is that they are much more interested infinding out what is going on in academic institutions. Wehave many more representatives of foreign firms coming aroundto our robotics institute, wanting to talk to ourcomputer-science people and our electrical-engineeringpeople, than we do American firms. We go out and drag in someAmerican firms.                                                                                                          Weren't you persuaded recently to take on some foreigncorporate research partners instead of American ones?   We have a project where we're trying to develop theability to get a machine to translate language. We'reparticularly interested in being able to speak into themachine in Japanese, and have it translate in English andvice versa. We've had difficulty in getting real interestfrom American firms on it. I went to Japan, took along somepeople from this project, and we put on some seminars. We gotsignificant support from the Japanese. Hitachi was a majorcontributor. Matsushita also has gotten very interested. Wealso have some Japanese scientists working on the project.They're our Ph.D.s -- Japanese who got their Ph.D.s {atCarnegie Mellon}.   We started out in our robotics institute with the notionthat the Japanese would be excluded. It was my view in 1980that our robotics institute could contribute to the saving ofAmerican manufacturing. We got some support from Americanfirms, but we could not get the total support we needed. Ihave now been much more willing to listen to Japanese firms,and we're expecting some significant support from Japanesefirms. Siemens {of West Germany} has also been taken in. Ingeneral, American firms will not support basic research.                                                                                                          Haven't we seen more abuses in academic research sincebusiness has become more involved?   I wouldn't say the abuses have come from a relationshipbetween industries and universities. The abuses have comefrom the fact that in many areas, more faculty members havehad business opportunities, and university administrationshave been lax. So you have the question of: Will that personpublish his results of his research, or does he want to holdthem back for proprietary purposes for his firm? The amountof time spent on the firm may be shortchanging the students.   You do have to be careful, however, about the intertwiningof business and the universities in that it's extremelyimportant for universities to do basic research, because itisn't being done by the firms. The more businesses becomeinvolved and emphasize short-run results -- applied research-- you tend to divert the faculty from basic research.                                                                                                          Has the great post-World War II American business schoolexpansion been a failure?   I wouldn't say it's been a failure, but certainly its weakspots have been exposed. Our business schools have let downsociety by not doing a better job of truly studyingmanagement. Looking at human resources and human-resourcedevelopment, looking at questions of how you improveproductivity, how you involve your work force to do a betterjob -- these are the kinds of things we should have beendoing.                                                                                                          Yet places like Yale are de-emphasizing the organizationalapproach.   I think that's a serious error. What's happening there isthose whom I'll call more discipline-oriented are in largeenough numbers so that they've driven the others out. Anyonewho's looking at management has to really lament whathappened there. The whole organization area -- even if youcan't develop strong theorems in that area -- is a crucial,crucial area, and I think one abandons that at one's peril.</TEXT></DOC>
