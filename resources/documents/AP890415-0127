Her unborn child isincredibly at risk because of this battering.''   Nurses, a prosecutor and the operator of a battered women'sshelter joined Berkhemer-Credaire on Friday at a March of Dimesnews conference intended to increase awareness of abuse of pregnantwomen.   Also attending was 28-year-old Mary Siering, who choked backtears as she recounted how her boyfriend abused her while she waspregnant.   ``He slapped me in the face, he threw a sneaker at my stomachwhen I was five months pregnant, and he put me in a headlock,'' shesobbed. ``He held me hostage in the apartment against my will. WhenI tried to call 911, he ripped the cord out of the wall.''   Siering, a social worker for Los Angeles County, said herboyfriend fled to the East Coast without being prosecuted, and herchild, Rita Frances, now 2, ``trusts the world because her mothercares enough to protect her.''   Still, battered women are four times more likely to deliverbabies with low birth weights, and twice as likely to miscarrycompared with other mothers, Berkhemer-Credaire said.   ``Low-birth-weight babies are more likely to be born with birthdefects and more than 40 times more likely to die during the firstmonth of life,'' she added.   She and others urged doctors and nurses to watch for signs ofbattering in their pregnant patients, and to help document injuriesso the assailants can be prosecuted.   Battered women also should seek help and emergency shelter andleave those abusing them, said participants in the conference atKaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center.   Abuse against expectant mothers happens in all racial andsocioeconomic groups, said Anne Stewart Helton, a community healthnurse consultant at Texas Women's University.   Helton conducted a foundation-financed study of 290 pregnantwomen randomly selected from public and private prenatal clinics inHouston. She found 8 percent _ or one in 12 _ were beaten by theirmale partners during pregnancy, and another 15 percent reportedbeing battered earlier.   More research is needed to confirm her belief that thestatistics are valid nationwide, Helton said. But many expertsbelieve the one-in-12 figure is low because women tend to fearadmitting they have been abused, she said.   ``Only one in every five incidents of domestic violence isreported,'' said Mia Baker, a special assistant district attorneywho runs Los Angeles County's victim-witness assistance program.   She said 4,000 American women die at their partners' hands eachyear.   The March of Dimes said 3 million to 4 million American womenare battered each year, resulting in one-fifth of all hospitalemergency room visits by women. Their injuries account for annualcosts of $100 million for medical care and up to $5 million inabsenteeism.</TEXT></DOC>
