Kuwait, which owns a big piece of British Petroleum Corp., is represented at the local BP service station. Across the street sits an outlet of Texaco Inc., which currently buys more oil from Saudi Arabia than anyone else in the world.    Then there is Ray's Amoco, where Lenny Hohmann is shoving a heavy rubber hose from his gasoline truck into the underground storage tanks. For some two months the gasoline has been wending its way from Texas City, Texas, where it first hit U.S. soil as Mayan crude from Mexico. The oil might just as easily have come from Kuwait, Trinidad or any of a dozen other countries. Amoco Corp. doesn't care -- U.S. oil companies don't discriminate on the basis of national origin.    Intersections like Route 9 and Ernston Road dot America like needle marks on a junkie's arm. After struggling to kick the habit during the 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. is once again hooked on imported oil, and the addiction will only worsen.    That simple and alarming fact escapes most motorists, who have lately been paying less for gasoline than at any other time since the Iranian oil shock in the late 1970s. The world, we are told, is awash in oil. But the U.S. is running out of oil much faster than the rest of the world.    As motorists prepare for summer excursions, as Detroit introduces new, lower-mileage luxury cars and as utilities continue switching from more plentiful fuels, the U.S. is importing four of every 10 barrels it consumes, up from three of every 10 two years ago and edging relentlessly toward the high of almost 50% a decade ago.    Wall Street gyrates with fluctuations in the trade deficit, seemingly unaware that the biggest portion of the deficit -- imported oil -- can only rise.    &quot;There's no getting away from the fact,&quot; says Robert Stobaugh, a Harvard University energy expert. &quot;Even though there are a lot of oil producers in the world, the reserves are still in the Middle East.&quot;    These days, imported oil more than just drives cars. It also makes them. The plastic body of many Corvettes is made from foreign oil, not to mention the asphalt under the wheels. Petrochemicals refined from imported crude can end up as plastic parts in the Stealth fighter, as polyester in the shirt on your back and as fibers in the carpet under your feet. Chances are your two-liter plastic Pepsi bottle has some Trinidadian oil in it, and your Crest toothpaste comes in a container made partly from Persian Gulf crude. &quot;It's all oil-based,&quot; says Robert Sieron, an Amoco chemical specialist.    As the U.S. consumes more oil products, it has less oil from which to manufacture them. After giving birth to the oil industry more than a century ago, the U.S. is the first major country to experience the effects of running out.    Imports have been higher in the past, but never before has their upward course been irreversible, as it seems today. A decade ago, Jimmy Carter put on a sweater and asked Americans to turn down their thermostats. They did. And they bought high-mileage cars to replace gas-guzzlers, spurred in part by the rising cost of gasoline when oil-price controls were abolished. At the same time, a huge oil field in Alaska, the biggest ever discovered in North America, opened up. By 1986, oil imports fell to 31% of U.S. consumption, the lowest level since 1972. The energy crisis, it seemed, had passed.    But it hadn't. Not by a long shot. The 1986 oil-price crash not only cooled consumers' desire to conserve but also virtually killed the floundering efforts to develop alternative forms of energy. The nation's appetite for oil, which had declined for five years, grew almost 3% in 1986 and almost 2% in 1987. And it will probably increase again this year.    While the nation's need for oil increases, for the first time its supply of oil can only decline. Even in the drilling hysteria of the early 1980s, no big, new oil fields were found. Wildcatters everywhere have reached the sobering conclusion that except for the high-cost, hard-to-get exploration plays offshore and in Alaska, not a single major oil field is left to be discovered in the U.S. Thus, in their view, the need for foreign oil can only be slowed, and not reversed, by increased exploration here.    The U.S. is so pockmarked with wells -- two million have been drilled since World War II -- that reserves are depleted and companies are winding down their search. Phillips Petroleum Co. will spend more money this year looking for oil in the North Sea than in its home state of Oklahoma. In the past decade or so, Shell Oil Co. has spent $25 billion on exploration and production, but more than half of that was to squeeze out the last drops of oil from existing fields and for offshore projects in the Gulf of Mexico.    Iraq, despite its war with Iran, produces more oil a day than Louisiana and Oklahoma combined. It has three times as much oil in the ground as the U.S.    What is to be done about the growing dependence on foreign oil? Officials offer a few temporary remedies that would probably just prolong the inevitable. Many are pushing for tax incentives to encourage exploration in areas where they say it is now uneconomic to drill. A few seek an oil-import fee.    But many in the industry fear government's hand in their business more than they fear Saudi crude. And Washington finds such measures politically onerous anyway, particularly in an election year.    As a result, the U.S. more and more is locked in to dependence on foreign oil. It has sent an armada to protect oil shipments in the Persian Gulf -- at a cost to taxpayers that some estimates put at $200 a barrel, or about 13 times the current market price of oil. And the sprawling facilities built and maintained by the oil companies -- billions of dollars of ships, port facilities, refineries, pipelines, trucks and service stations -- increasingly are designed to use overseas supplies.    The crude going to Ray's Amoco begins its trip offshore from Mexico at a loading facility called Cayo Arcas. There, an Amoco-owned vessel, the Brisbane Sea, loads 450,000 barrels of it for passage across the Gulf to Texas City.    The long Texas City dock is like a home port for a United Nations meeting, with five of the world's seven continents represented. The Brisbane Sea, registered in Monrovia, Liberia, is piloted by an Italian. South Koreans man its sister ship, which is unloading oil from Trinidad across the dock. Taos Sotirelis, a Greek, runs the dock for Amoco.    &quot;We see 10 foreign-flagged vessels for one American-flagged vessel,&quot; says Mark Roth, superintendent of marine operations for Amoco's nearby Texas City refinery. &quot;It's cheaper.&quot;    The tanker lightens itself of its $7 million or so of cargo as its captain argues by walkie-talkie over a delivery of frozen-food provisions. Through a single 36-inch pipe on this single day passes 0.6% of the entire U.S. trade deficit for the month. No big deal to the people doing the moving. &quot;We think of carrying something from A to B,&quot; says Amoco's Mr. Sotirelis. &quot;How much it's worth is for somebody else to worry about.&quot;    The 214 million barrels of petroleum the U.S. imported that month, January, accounted for 29% of the trade deficit. And while the weak dollar is spurring U.S. exports of grain, steel and computers, it does little to affect the flow of oil.    While domestic oil needs rose gradually in the past two years, production fell by an average of 700,000 barrels a day, equivalent to the output of 50,000 wells. The average well in the U.S. trickles just 14 barrels a day, compared with 7,000 barrels a day for a well in Saudi Arabia.    The downward slope in production will only steepen over time, industry officials say. &quot;We will have to import large volumes of oil whether we like it or not,&quot; says Constantine Nicandros, chief executive of Conoco Inc., a unit of Du Pont Co.    Venezuela and Mexico, large exporters to the U.S., produce mainly heavy, high-sulfur oil. Nigerian oil is light and &quot;sweet,&quot; or low in sulfur. West Texas intermediate is just that -- intermediate. Canadian crude runs the gamut. Each variety requires a different process. Several years ago, refiners generally could handle only a few varieties of crude. But that was when the nearest U.S. oil field could keep the refinery primed. Lately, refineries have spent billions of dollars overhauling their units to handle crude from the greatest number of sources possible.    Amoco processed 15 types of foreign oil in Texas City last year. &quot;We placed investments in Texas City that give us the ability to process any crude in the world,&quot; says Jack Brinly, a refinery manager. &quot;That gives us a lot more choices to make.&quot; At the same time the refinery processes the Mexican oil, it changes crudes from Trinidad, Alaska, West Texas and Kuwait into gasoline.    The crude is so precious that companies find a use for every drop. &quot;A major undertaking is to make sure we track all the hydrocarbons in this refinery,&quot; Mr. Brinly says.    The Mexican crude bound for the Northeast moves from the docks to the Amoco refinery in Texas City, where it sits in storage tanks for 19 days. Then, over the course of about 11 days, it moves through a labyrinth of pipes and boilers, beginning with a distiller called Pipestill 3B. Thence it crawls through various paths in the refinery, depending on its ultimate destination and use.    About 13% of the load goes into chemical processing, where a &quot;reforming unit&quot; and an &quot;aromatic recovery unit&quot; transform the material into petrochemical feedstocks. Soon it reaches Amoco's Chocolate Bayou chemical plant, 25 miles away, where much is turned into long, spaghettilike strips of polypropylene. Machines chop the spaghetti into pellets and load them into railroad cars 180,000 pounds at a time.    The hopper cars form a moving pipeline, transporting the polypropylene to nine weaving plants in Alabama and Georgia, where Amoco -- one of the world's largest weavers -- spins it into more than 2.5 billion square yards of carpet-backing a year.    Back at the Texas City refinery, most of the Mexican load is being transformed molecule by molecule into gasoline. Soon it is shoved into the $1.4 billion Colonial Pipeline, the busiest of its kind in the nation.    Gasoline, fuel oil, kerosene and other products flow through the line in turn at three to five miles per hour, to be siphoned off at any of 260 terminals, from Opelousas, La., to Chattahoochee, Ga., and as far north as New Jersey. The pipeline each year moves enough gasoline alone to fuel every vehicle in New England -- for four years.    Amoco's New Jersey-bound gasoline takes about two weeks to reach a terminal in Carteret, N.J., where it finally leaves its spic-and-span world. Delivery trucks pull up beneath large hoses, flood their tanks and take off for nearby service stations. &quot;We're in the trenches here,&quot; says Gerald Maher, the terminal's manager.    Finally, two months after the Mayan crude passed U.S. customs, it is about to move into the hands of consumers. In a rote process he repeats several times a day, Mr. Hohmann, the truck driver, turns nobs and hooks up hoses, walks behind a safety screen and pushes the button that fills his truck.    The drive to Ray's Amoco in Sayreville is just 12 miles. When Mr. Hohmann arrives, he can't fill the station's tanks just yet. First, the dealer climbs a ladder on the back of the truck, looks down into the storage compartments and checks the levels to make sure he is getting what he paid for. When it comes to hydrocarbons, every drop counts.    ---                   Where Crude Comes From        1987 average in thousands of barrels per day    Canada                                          837    Venezuela                                       768    Saudi Arabia                                    747    Mexico                                          645    Nigeria                                         530    United Kingdom                                  349    Algeria                                         284   Source: Department of Energy</TEXT></DOC>
