On August 17, 1989, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 33918-33920, Docket No. 88-216) a proposedto amend the regulations by adding Chile to the list of countries declaredto be free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, and also to add Chileto the list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest andfoot-and-mouth disease, are subject to special restrictions of the importationof their meat and other animal products into the United States. Our proposalinvited the submission of written comments, which were required to be receivedon or before October 16, 1989. We have received requests from the United States Animal Health Association(USAHA), a milk producers federation, and three State departments of agricultureto extend the comment period until after the annual meeting of the USAHAin early November. We have also received a request from a law firm representingthe International Llama Association to extend the comment period untilNovember 27, 1989. In response to these requests, we are extending thecomment period for an additional 30 days. We believe this would allow participantsat the USAHA meeting, as well as other interested persons, to further discussthe proposed rule and formulate comments concerning it, including its impacton small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We will considerall written comments received on or before November 15, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>7 U.S.C. 147a, 150ee, 161, 162, 450; 19 U.S.C. 1306;21 U.S.C. 111, 114a, 134a, 134b, 134c, and 134f; 31 U.S.C. 9701; 42 U.S.C.4331, 4332; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 6th day of October 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
