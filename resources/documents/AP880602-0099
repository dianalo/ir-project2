(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker says he's looking for officespace near here to begin a new TV ministry, and he may ask for airtime on the PTL network.   ``We see Pat Robertson settling back into the `700 Club.' We seeJimmy Swaggart settling back,'' Bakker said Wednesday in front ofhis father's house on the grounds of Heritage USA, PTL's Christiantheme park.   ``The whole gospel message is a message of restoration, and ifit can't happen for the leadership then it can't happen for thelaymen.''   Bakker has several times in the past said that he and his wife,Tammy, should have a chance to salvage the failing ministry theybuilt before his downfall in a sex scandal last year, but PTLofficials have always ruled it out.   The ministry is up to $130 million in debt, and a reorganizationplan that calls for sale of much of its assets is up for approvalin Bankruptcy Court.   Bakker went to Heritage USA on Tuesday to talk with attorneysand PTL officials on behalf of developer Roe Messner, who claimsPTL owes him $14 million.   Some of Bakker's longtime supporters gave him a warm reception,and that energized his efforts to regain control of PTL, said JimToms, one of Bakker's lawyers.   ``He had not talked with some of these people for 15 months, andwas very encouraged,'' Toms said Wednesday.   On Tuesday, Bakker told reporters he might try to buy PTL'sassets when they are liquidated, but refused to say where he wouldget the money. On Wednesday, Bakker said he intended to open anoffice near Heritage USA and go on television to ask for money.   ``We need a very large space, especially because of the amountof mailing we'll have to do,'' said Bakker. He said a marketingfirm has told him he has 1 million willing financial supporters.   ``We'll start over again getting individual air stations,'' hesaid. ``We may offer to purchase time on the PTL Network. Westarted with one station and we'll start again.''   Bakker then left for his home in Gatlinburg, Tenn., in a blackLincoln borrowed from the leader of the Bring Bakkers Back movement.   Bakker left PTL after charges that Jessica Hahn, a churchsecretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter withhim. His departure was followed by revelations about a lavishlifestyle, and he was defrocked by the Assemblies of God.</TEXT></DOC>
