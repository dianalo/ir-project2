Wednesday's seizure was the largest such haul in a series ofraids across the country aimed at cable TV piracy, an industryofficial said.   B andamp; B Inc. in Eagan and Lake Sylvan Sales in Burnsville, whichwere selling the devices, are being investigated for possiblecopyright and wire fraud violations, the FBI said. No arrests weremade Wednesday.   The devices unscramble cable and satellite TV signals, allowingviewers to receive broadcasts without paying for them.   Dennis Sackreiter, Minneapolis FBI agent in charge ofwhite-collar crime investigations, said cable companies supplyconverters that unscramble channels such as HBO and ESPN to TVviewers who pay for those channels. The unscrambling is done bypatented and copyrighted computer chips.   He said cable companies sell outdated converters to companiessuch as Lake Sylvan and B andamp; B, which then update them, illegally.   Some 10,000 to 15,000 descramblers were taken from Lake SylvanSales and 2,000 to 3,000 were confiscated from B andamp; B, Sackreitersaid.   Both companies denied any wrongdoing.   ``We always have our customers sign a disclaimer waiver that saysthey will not use this in any illegal manner,'' Lake Sylvan ownerBill Donaldson said today. ``If it is used at all, they agree tonotify the cable companies and pay the fees.''   ``It's not illegal to sell or buy the decoders,'' said B andamp; BManager Bill Shultheis. ``It's what people do with them afterwardsthat may be illegal _ like a gun. We advertise in about 20magazines. We have nothing to hide.''   Cable TV operators have worked with the FBI for several years tocrack down on unauthorized suppliers of such equipment, and similarraids have been conducted across the nation.   Of those, Wednesday's haul was the largest, said Jim Allen,director of the National Cable Television Association's office ofcable signal theft.</TEXT></DOC>
