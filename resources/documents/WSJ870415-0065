The company said the increase reflected strong demand for forest products, a better product mix and the favorable results of major capital improvements.    Sales in the quarter were $1.86 billion, up 16% from $1.6 billion a year earlier.    Georgia-Pacific said its pulp and paper division had a particularly strong quarter, helped in part by favorable currency-exchange rates. Its building-products division was buoyed by growing demand for lumber and plywood, and by strong single-family housing starts.    First-quarter earnings included a pre-tax gain of $6 million from the redemption of the company's remaining holdings of preferred stock of Georgia Gulf Corp., which bought Georgia-Pacific's commodity-chemicals subsidiary in 1984. In last year's first quarter, a change in Georgia-Pacific's timber-capitalization policy increased net income by about $8 million.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Georgia-Pacific shares closed at $45, down $2.875. </TEXT></DOC>
