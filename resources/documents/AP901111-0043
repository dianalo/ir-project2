(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A shadowy trade in armaments abandoned bythe United States at the end of the Vietnam War will be illuminatedin a trial scheduled to begin this week in federal court.   Cenon Rey Avelino, a Canadian citizen of Filipino origin, isaccused of trying to smuggle two Cessna A-37 Dragonfly jets fromVietnam into the United States after selling the jets to undercoverU.S. Customs agents for $306,000.   The light attack planes, dismantled and crated, were seized ayear ago by Customs agents at Buffalo's international Peace Bridge.Avelino was later indicted on charges ranging from money-launderingto violating the Trading with the Enemy Act.   His trial begins Tuesday before U.S. District Judge John T.Elfvin and is expected to last about three weeks. Avelino, who hasbeen held without bail since his arrest, could face more than 10years in prison if convicted on all charges.   Avelino, 40, of suburban Toronto, is portrayed in court papersas a globe-trotting arms dealer who boasted he could obtain avariety of military hardware abandoned by the United States inVietnam.   The Pentagon has estimated that nearly 1,000 military planes,including 113 Dragonflys, were abandoned in Vietnam when the UnitedStates pulled out in 1975. Also abandoned were 940 naval ships andboats, 42,000 trucks, 791,000 M-16 rifles and a large amount ofother assorted weaponry.   Avelino told the agents he represented the government of Vietnamand could get $18 million worth of arms from that country,according to statements filed in court by U.S. Customs and RoyalCanadian Mounted Police officers.   Federal officials have said they are concerned that Vietnam maybe selling abandoned U.S. arms to Third World countries unfriendlyto the United States.   At a pretrial hearing last winter, the customs agent in chargeof the case, C.W. Moore, said agents had considered trying to getAvelino to work for them so the U.S. government could acquire moreof the abandoned arms and keep them from falling ``into the handsof madmen.''   That idea was scuttled when the Customs Service and the DefenseDepartment refused to pay for the scheme, Moore said.   U.S. Attorney Dennis C. Vacco has said the undercover agents whodealt with Avelino in Toronto and Jacksonville, Fla., portrayedAmerican businessmen. He refused to say what reasons the agentsgave for wanting the jets.   James Harrington, Avelino's lawyer, has said his client is alegitimate businessman who never concealed his ties to thegovernment of Vietnam.   The jets had been sitting idle for 15 years and were in no shapefor combat, Harrington said. He said Avelino understood the agentswanted them for parts.   The A-37, according to Air Force manuals, can carry variouscombinations of rockets and bombs under its wings. The planes alsocould be equipped with 7.62mm machine guns.   A-37s, which could fly more than 500 mph and higher than 40,000feet, originally cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1 million apiecewhen they were built in the 1950s and '60s.   Avelino told Customs agents at the border that his cargoincluded dismantled jets. But he misrepresented the type ofaircraft and declared their value to be only $36,000, authoritiessaid.</TEXT></DOC>
