The prediction method uses the one dimensionalfluidized bed model in connection to a solar concentrator-receiver model.An analytical study of the different design parameters such as the concentrationratio, concentrator aperture area and the size of the fluidized bed ispresented. The results are then used to obtain a correlation betweensome performance and design parameters, which can be used to optimizethe design of the fluidized bed-concentrator storage system.</TEXT></DOC>
