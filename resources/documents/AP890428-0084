Gorbachev, the party newspaperPravda said today.   The editorial followed by one day the newspaper's publication ofstartling admissions of failure made by party officials at ameeting of the policy-making Central Committee on Tuesday.   A senior Western diplomat today said the publication of theadmissions may have been a device used by Gorbachev to force theofficials to more solidly back his program of politicalrestructuring, known as perestroika.   Pravda said political activity has rapidly increased over thepast year and democratization is gaining ground.   ``In many cases, however, party organizations and functionarieshave proved unprepared for the rapid progress in extendingdemocracy,'' the newspaper said. ``A number of party committees andlocal governing councils are lagging behind the times in theirattitudes, styles, methods and interpretation of events.''   It said many officials were lapsing ``into old thinking,nostalgia for authoritarian leadership and panicky attempts tocheck grassroots initiatives under the pretext of protectingsocialism.''   Pravda called on all party members, committees and organizationsto follow the line of change initiated by Gorbachev, regardless ofcurrent difficulties facing the economy and society.   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some ofthe 20 speakers at the Central Committee meeting may have beentaken by surprise when Gorbachev suggested their comments bepublished for the public to read.   The speeches were sharply critical of the party. For example,Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin said, ``The people feeluncomfortable, alarmed, have lost their optismism, and variousgenerations of people, separate social levels and even regions arequarreling with themselves.''   As a result, said Saikin, who lost in the recent elections forthe new Congress of People's Deputies, party organizations ``havelost their vanguard role.''   Gorbachev, in closing remarks at the meeting Tuesday, agreedperestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages ofhousing, consumer goods and food. But, the 58-year-old leader said,people still have faith in the party.   Gorbachev gained strength to push for more extreme action atTuesday's meeting when 74 of the Central Committee's 301 membersretired.   Because of age, illness or political disgrace, those who steppeddown had lost the top government or party job that entitled them tomembership. The remarks of some of those who retired were publishedThursday.   Among them was Geidar A. Aliev, the 65-year-old former partychief in Azerbaijan and a close associate of former PresidentLeonid I. Brezhnev.   News reports have accused Aliev of corruption and falsifyingrecords to show he was a war veteran. But Aliev told the CentralCommittee the accusations were untrue and came from people he hadfired in Azerbaijan for wrongdoing.   Approximately three dozen party officials lost their bids forseats in the 2,250-seat parliament, or Congress of People'sDeputies.   Vladimir I. Melnikov, the party chief of the Komi region, toldthe committee that many officials are so afraid of the people'swrath that they are refusing to run in the next round of electionson May 14.   ``We are losing the workers,'' he said. The country is ``in areal crisis'' that Gorbachev is not fully aware of because theCentral Committee staff is ``safeguarding the general secretaryfrom the severity of the situation.''   Because of the failures of perestroika, ``the authority of theparty is falling in the eyes of the public,'' said Ivan K.Polozkov, a party leader in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia.</TEXT></DOC>
