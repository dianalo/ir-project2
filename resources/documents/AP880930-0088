The end of the 30-day season will give some a rest from stalkingor skinning.   ``We've been going pretty much straight out all month. Now we'regoing to add everything up and see if it was worth it,'' said GrantDunaway, whose processing plant near Immokalee received about 180alligators caught by some of the 238 hunters, mostly novices whowon their permits in a state lottery.   Dennis David, head of alligator monitoring for the state Gameand Fresh Water Fish Commission, said hide prices on theinternational market have remained stable at $40 to $44 a foot, butthe hunt dropped local gator meat prices about 25 percent to $4 to$5 a pound.   Wildlife officials aren't expected to have a final count on thehunt, in which each hunter had a limit of 15 gators, until laterthis year, but the original projection was of about 75 percent ofthe maximum 3,570 gators.   ``From what we can see so far, that seems to be a pretty goodguess,'' Dennis said.   The impact of the hunt on the state's estimated 1 millionalligators will be studied and new rules for next year's hunt couldbe adopted in January, Dennis said.   Some of the possible revisions could be selecting new sites forthe hunt and loosening regulations to allow people without permitsto transport gators to processing facilities, said Dennis.   The state established the hunt in response to a proliferation ofthe once-threatened species. State wildlife experts credit stronganti-poaching laws adopted in 1970 as the principal reason for atwofold population growth in the past 20 years.   The alligator was removed from the federal endangered specieslist in 1977, and since 1981 the state has conducted experimentalhunts in selected areas with heavy gator populations.   Several poachers were caught during the hunt, but mostinfractions by permit holders were minor, including hunting outsidedesignated boundaries and failing to properly tag their catch.   ``But for the most part we're quite pleased with the way thehunt was handled,'' said Dennis. ``We didn't have anyone bittenlike people feared.''   Most novice hunters hired experienced guides and only onehunt-related injury has been reported since the season opened Sept.1.   A hunter on Lake George in northeast Florida lost part of afinger when he accidentally discharged a bang-stick, a device thatfires a bullet on impact. Several airboats capsized, but no otherinjuries were reported, said commission spokesman John White.   In Louisiana, which opened its 17th annual 30-day season Sept.10, 23,800 gators were taken last year. Texas, which resumedalligator hunts in 1984, issued permits for 1,500 gators for the16-day season that ended Sept. 18.</TEXT></DOC>
