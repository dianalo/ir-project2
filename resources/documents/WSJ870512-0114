Thai officials, worried about possible market manipulation and insider trading in the rapidly rising market, recently introduced a series of regulatory changes.    They include raising margin requirements to 35% of the value of shares bought from 25%; establishing deadlines for payments and transfers of shares after stock sales; allowing brokers to sell shares bought for clients if the customers fail to settle their accounts within the specified time, and requiring investors to pay in cash for all transactions. Previously, a client could buy a stock and then sell it within three days without ever having to put up any money to cover the original buy order.    Because of these and other changes, many Thai market watchers now consider a rerun of the 1979 crash unlikely. At that time, speculators' ability to buy shares without any cash backing created an inflated market that collapsed easily, according to Maruey Phadoonsidhi, the Thai exchange's president. These days, the bulk of trading occurs on a cash basis, so leveraging isn't dangerously high, he says.    Other officials say brokers, many of whom took a beating eight years ago, have become tougher with wayward customers, and many have installed computer systems that keep better track of accounts.    In addition, officials are considering setting up an agency like the U.S.'s Securities and Exchange Commission to pursue cases of price manipulation and insider trading and to handle other regulatory duties that currently are the Thai stock exchange's responsibility. They say creating such an organization would allow exchange staff to devote more time to bringing new companies onto the exchange and improving its operations.    Some exchange officials also say having a Thai equivalent of the SEC would speed implementation of the exchange's rules.    &quot;Many of the exchange's other problems would disappear if there was a single body they could go to&quot; for regulatory matters, a U.S. executive here says.    Currently, proposed rule changes must wend their way through a maze of bureaucracy, sometimes languishing for months without receiving any attention.    The exchange also made some changes last month to try to enliven trading and encourage more companies to join. Currently, only 86 companies and three mutual funds, with total market capitalization of about $3.52 billion, are quoted on the exchange.    For instance, it relaxed the rule that at least 30% of a company's capital must be held by small shareholders for it to be listed. In addition, the Thai Finance Ministry has approved the exchange's plans for setting up a second trading board with less stringent listing criteria than the main one.    Another important difference between the current market and the one preceding the 1979 crash is that this one seems to have a substantial economic basis. Analysts say the Thai market's current rally is being fueled by a rebound in the country's economy, the less attractive returns available on other investments such as bank deposits and land speculation, and the attractive price-earnings ratios of listed companies.    The average P-E ratio of Thai listed companies is slightly above 12. That is higher than the ratio of eight to nine long prevailing on the local market but still comparatively low by Asian or other international standards.    In addition, &quot;most of the companies announcing their first-quarter results are showing major improvements in profit,&quot; Sivaporn Dardarananda, president of Thai Investment, a finance and brokerage concern, says. &quot;In 1978-79, people were worried whether the (listed) firms were even financially sound.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
