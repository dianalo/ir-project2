The Arabic-language statement was issued in Beirut and signed byMcCarthy's brother Terrence.   ``I plead with you in the name of mercy and justice for whichIslam is known, to fulfill the wish of an ailing woman to see herson before she dies,'' the statement said.   The Beirut office of the London-based Worldwide Television Newsnetwork distributed the appeal.   McCarthy, a journalist, was working for WTN when he was kidnappedApril 17, 1986, as he was being driven to Beirut airport to catch aflight to London.   It was the fourth such appeal in two weeks. McCarthy's father,Pat, pleaded for McCarthy's release on June 20, saying the captive'smother, Sheila, was ``gravely ill in hospital.''   ``She is dying in one of London's hospitals. Bring back John forher so that she departs this life peacefully,'' Terrence McCarthy'sappeal said.   ``Please bring back the smile to the face of the McCarthy familyat this critical period. Please release John,'' it concluded.   McCarthy, 32, is one of 14 foreigners held captive in Lebanon.   His brother's message did not name any of the Moslem extremistgroups holding hostages, because none has claimed to hold McCarthy.   Nine Americans are among those held. The hostage held longest isAmerican journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
