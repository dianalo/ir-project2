 These new technologies are, however, upsetting thetraditional equilibrium of the information economy.andM;The Main Changes in the Information EconomyandM;Information has become both a variegated set of activities and a raw materialwhich is essential at all levels of economic activity.andP;  The same informationmay be transmitted via different, coexistent generations of services.andO;Traditional press and book publishers are liable to find themselves competingwith unconventional publishers who communicate through radio, television andnew on-line information services.andM;At the same time, information is present at all levels of activity and in allsectors of the economy, whether it is used to seek out technologicalintelligence, to supply market information or to manage a production line.andM;Information is also being considered more and more as a tradable commoditywhich is subject to the economies of scale by reason of the increased cost ofcollecting, codifying, verifying, assimilating and stocking relevant data, ontop of a considerable initial investment.andM;Technical, legal, commercial and financial information is a commodity ofgreat value which is sold at high prices by specialized companies.andM;Business communications are assuming considerable importance and represent aninvestment which is greater than the budget of the cinema industry.andP;  It iscurrently estimated that information handling in the widest sense covers 55percent of jobs and two-thirds of the GNP in Europe.andM;With the progress of technology, the information and communicationsindustries and the policies related to them are exerting an ever-greaterinfluence on the economy.andM;In consequence, information constitutes now more than ever an element ofpower, in business, in society and between nations.andM;The Prospects: New Needs Which Will Bring About AandM;Rapid Growth Of Information ServicesandM;The growth of information needs has been accompanied by a change in the typeand quality of information required.andP;  Formerly only information specialistssearched databases.andP;  Now professionals in industry and trade need to havedirect access to information services which are more and more sophisticated.andO;These new users are looking for information which is tailored to theirspecific needs, is easily and quickly accessible and allows a high degree ofinteractivity.andM;Insofar as suppliers of equipment and services will be in a position torespond to these requirements, the prospects for the European informationmarket appear particularly encouraging:andM;* The 93,000 libraries in the European Community, with a total budget of theorder of 7 to 10,000 million (European Community Units) ECUs, represent animportant potential market for advanced information services.andP;  They areincreasingly playing an intermediary and advisory role in database searching.andM;* In-house or desk-top publishing of catalogs an technical documents could beresponsible for a turnover in the order of 5000 million ECU by 1990.andM;* Transactional services (electronic mail, electronic data transfer) areundergoing rapid growth and could reach a turnover on the order of 6000million ECU by 1990.andM;* Finally, the European electronic information services market will see itsturnover grow from 1 to more than 10,000 million ECU in 10 years.andP;  This wouldbe equivalent to an annual growth rate in the order of 20 to 30 percent peryear.andM;Moreover, the potential for employment represented by the growth ininformation activities cannot be ignored.andP;  It is estimated that 100,000people currently work in the sector of electronic information in Europe.andP;  Iflibraries, traditional publishing, telecommunications and manufacturers ofelectronic equipment are included, then several million people are involvedin the industry.andM;The Position of EuropeandM;As a result of these changes and prospects, Europe is faced with a challenge.andO;It possesses some notable advantages but its position on the worldinformation market has become relatively weaker since the advent ofelectronic services.andM;Europe is producing at the moment only half as many on-line databases as theUnited States.andP;  In 1986 the turnover of most of the European suppliers ofspecialized electronic information services was only half of that of theirAmerican counterparts.andP;  The Community market is fragmented by many technical,legal and linguistic barriers.andP;  This fragmentation hinders the free movementof information and services and therefore prevents the achievement of theeconomies of scale which are necessary in order to launch advancedinformation services.andM;Investment in the industry by the private sector is handicapped by the lackof relevant statistical data on market trends and also by uncertainty as topublic policies.andP;  Almost 70 percent of European databases are still beingproduced by the public sector or by non-profit-making organizations, whereasin the United States 75 percent belong to the private sector.andM;It appears difficult for member states individually to create the marketconditions which would enable European suppliers of information serviceseffectively to vie with the world competition in new services.andM;The Community as a whole possesses, however, some undeniable potentialadvantages which should be turned to account:andM;* a market of 320 million inhabitants which remains to be unified,andM;* an abundance of raw information material in science, technology andculture,andM;* a competitive industry and expertise in the field of telecommunications,andM;* a very real innovative capacity in the sector of information services, asevidenced by the exceptional success of consumer videotex services in Europe.andM;To these advantages may be added a political will which has caused since 1984the necessary foundations to be laid for a European policy which will aim atthe creation of a European telecommunications area and at improving Europeancompetitiveness in the domain of informatics and electronics.andM;It is not, however, sufficient to attend to the tools and infrastructurewhich enable information to be collected, stored, handled, identified andtransmitted.andP;  The conditions also have to be created which will favor thesetting up at a European level of a vast internal market and the developmentof a competitive information services industry.andM;TOWARD A COMMUNITY POLICYandM;Detailed consultations with representatives of the national administrationsof the member states, the industry and information service users have beenundertaken by the Commission during the last few months on the basis of thefirst ideas worked out in document COM(185) 658 final.andP;  These consultationshave enabled a consensus to be reached on the objectives and lines of actionof a Community policy which will favor the development of both informationservices and the information market.andM;The ObjectivesandM;The objectives of such a policy, which would take full advantage of thedimension of the Community and at the same time complement national privateand public efforts to the best effect, are the following:andM;1) To establish an internal information services market;andM;2) To stimulate and reinforce the competitive capability of Europeansuppliers of information services;andM;3) To promote the use of new advanced information services in the Community;andM;4) To reinforce the joint efforts to achieve the internal and externalcohesion of the Community with respect to information services.andM;Information services must be allowed to develop freely in a vast internalmarket which offers the economies of scale necessary to their growth andprogress, thereby creating the conditions in which information flows candevelop both inside and outside the Community.andM;In parallel, the strengthening of the competitive capability of Europeaninformation suppliers is necessary to secure the position of the Community onthe world market and to facilitate the arrival of a new generation ofservices needed by research, trade and industry.andM;Improving the awareness of users and stimulating demand in a Europe which isslower than its competitors to take full advantage of the opportunitiesoffered by new technology is a supplementary objective which is essential ifthe viability of modern information services is to be assured and investmentstimulated.andM;However, the construction of an internal information market cannot beachieved if certain regions of the Community are excluded.andP;  The Commissionmust be particularly attentive to any initiative which could contribute toreducing regional dispartieis in information supply and access, for examplein the setting down of the telecommunications infrastructure under the STARprogram.andP;  Account must also be taken of this objective when the initiativesdesigned to achieve the aims (listed earlier) are defined by the Commissionin a follow-up to the present document.andP;  The emphasis which will be given todeveloping information services for SMEs will also be of direct concern tothe less favored regions of the Community as a result of their structure andeconomy.andP;  This attention will be reinforced in the choice of pilot projectsand by the development of specific actions, notably in the domain oftraining.andM;Finally, the internal joint efforts to reinforce the cohesion of thedifferent regions of the Community must be backed up by an enhanced effort bythe whole Community to show a common front and speak with a single voice inany discussions in international fora on the subject of economic activityconnected with the supply and demand of information services.andM;The initiatives which the Commission considers necessary to undertake, usingthe Community dimension to achieve the objectives proposed, are detailedhere.andM;A Plan of Priority InitiativesandM;It is proposed to attain these objectives through two complementary lines ofapproach:andM;* making a continuous effort to improve market conditions and promote the useof modern information services.andM;* setting up pilot and demonstration projects which are capable of exerting acatalytic effect on the development of the market in key sectors.andM;These two lines of approach will guide the implementation of a plan ofpriority initiatives set out as follows:andM;The Setting Up of a European Information Market Observatory.andP;  There existcurrently very few reliable quantitative or qualitative data on theinformation services market, industry and trade, on the impact of informationservices on the rest of the economy and on the needs of users.andP;  TheCommission proposes to create a European information market observatory whichshould:andM;* identify, collect and evaluate the available data on the different segmentsof the information market,andM;* identify gaps, define priorities and methodologies for joint efforts tocollect data which would be comparable across Europe.andM;* make a synthesis, at European level, or the results of socio-economicstudies carried out on the information market,andM;in order to supply information necessary to program policies and to guideinvestments.andP;  The Commission will define, with the help of a group ofspecialized experts, the composition, mandate and working methods of such anobservatory within six months from the transmission of the presentCommunication to the Council.andM;The Elimination of Technical, Administrative and Legal Barriers to Setting Upan Information Market.andP;  There exist numerous technical, administrative andlegal barriers which are responsible for the fragmentation of the informationmarket.andP;  The actions which need to be undertaken to overcome these barriershave to do with standardization, the harmonization of certain regulations andthe improvement of the conditions of transmission of and access toinformation services.andM;Actions to Support StandardizationandM;The Commission will develop actions which will support standardization in thearea of database access.andP;  In this effort it will build on the progress madein the area of standards for telecommunications and the new informationtechnologies.andP;  The initiatives to be taken will be complementary to theactions already carried out by the Commission in close consultation with theSenior Official's Group on Telecommunications (SOGT) and the SeniorOfficials' Group on Information Technologies Standardization (SOGITS).andM;They will bear on the following matters:andM;* Harmonization of procedures for connection to networks and hosts,andM;* automatic identification by networks of the configuration parameters ofterminal equipment.andM;* harmonization of documentary search software commands,andM;* harmonization of formats for data transfer by diskette and by downloadingand harmonization of downloading commands,andM;* definition of a logical standard for structuring sound, image and textdata, independent of the medium,andM;* establishment of a protocol for transmitting requests for primary documentsbetween bibliographic database hosts and electronic primary document deliveryservices,andM;* harmonization of certain criteria for the description of databases in orderto facilitate the user's choice,andM;* harmonization of the names and codes of fields which are common todatabases of the same type in a given information area, so as to facilitatesearching by occasional users, the automatic transfer of a search strategyfrom one base to another and downloading,andM;* adaptation of the principles used for indexing and cataloging electronicproducts and services,andM;* active promotion of existing standards.andM;These efforts in support of standardization in the field of database accesswill also take into account the work undertaken in the context of otherCommunity programs such as DELTA and AIM.andM;The Elimination of Legal and Administrative ObstaclesandM;By virtue of the work of the Legal Observatory on the information market,created in 1985, the extent of the problems has become apparent, as has theurgency of taking Community action to prevent new obstacles from springing upas a result of divergent approaches to the adaptation of existinglegislations.andP;  The Commission will take account of work already carried outin certain international fora and specialized groups and will make proposalsbefore 1990 in a number of priority areas.andM;The Comission will initiate a wide-ranging discussion of the questions ofintellectual property, including that of software, through the publication ofthe Green Book on copyright.andP;  It will also intensify the examination of theproblems of authentication of electronic transactions, electronic fraud andthe liability of information services.andM;With regard to the protection of personal data and the confidentiality ofdatabase searches, the Commission will continue to see to it that theConvention of the Council of Europe is implemented uniformly in the memberstates and that, if any problems should arise, other measures are taken intime.andM;The Improvement of the Conditions for Transmitting and Accessing InformationServices.andP;  The improvement of the conditions of access to telecommunicationsservices is a part of telecommunications policy.andM;While awaiting the coordinated installation of the integrated servicesdigital network (ISDN) (1) the Commission will accord special priority to theimprovement of the quality of services and to the interworking of thepacket-switching networks.andP;  Moreover, in the framework of the debateinitiated by the publication on June 10, 1987 of its Green Book onTelecommunications, (2) the Commission will discuss, at the appropriate time,the question of conditions of access to the networks and possible ways tostimulate the accelerated and harmonious development of value-added services(Open Network Provision), particularly in respect of the principles governingtarification.andM;The Commission will not only concern itself with the conditions ofinformation distribution via telecommunications.andP;  It will also continue itsefforts to bring about a concentration between publishers and the post, inorder to obtain an improvement in the conditions under which the postalservices distribute specialized information products (technical andcommercial books and journals, but also information products on new mediasuch as optical compact disks).andP;  It will also examine the question of thecharges made for information services, and will use its best endeavors in theinterests of users to improve the transparency of tariffs.andM;Actions Intended to Increase the Synergy between the Public and PrivateSectors.andP;  The public sector has a dynamic influence in supply and use ofadvanced information services in the Community.andP;  If a Community policy topromote the information market is to be effectively carried out, a jointapproach must be sought, particularly in the following areas:andM;* Transnational access to non-confidential data held by the public sector, sothat it can be processed and marketed by the private sector.andM;* codes of practice for the supply of advanced information services by thepublic sector,andM;* the role of the public sector as a possible customer for the introductionof innovative services.andM;The Commission has already started, together with the authorities concerned,to define a joint approach in these areas, taking into account nationaldifferences.andP;  The Community guidelines which will be formulated as a resultof this work will serve as a basis for the initiatives which will besubmitted to the Council for approval in the course of 1988.andM;The Launching of Pilot Projects.andP;  Because users are now requiring facilitiesof a different quality, a new generation of information services is neededwhich will be much easier to use, will take greater account of the linguisticdiversity of Europe and will correspond more closely to the complex andvaried needs of the end user in business and industry.andM;In the current state of the information market in the Community, there islittle hope that such services will spring up unaided in the near future.andM;The Commission considers, however, that a useful stimulus to suchdevelopments could be created by Community support for a number of pilot ordemonstration projects, which would be defined in collaboration with usersand/or the industry.andM;The purpose of these pilot and demonstration projects would be:andM;* To identify genuine obstacles hindering the creation of European servicesand a common information market, and to try out different remedies;andM;* to encourage different operators in the market to pool their resources andexpertise necessary to set up innovative products:andM;* to test the market response to those products;andM;* to identify medium-term priorities as defined by the needs of the market.andM;The envisaged projects must be large enough to exert a catalytic effect onthe development of the information services industry and on the market ingeneral.andM;They should also match the following criteria, wholly or in part:andM;* To achieve an optimal combination of competence through collaborationacross different specializations and different countries;andM;* to encourage cooperation between SMEs and the large organizations active inthe market;andM;* to target well-defined groups of users, in several Member States of theCommunity and particularly including those in SMEs;andM;* to incorporate the necessary multilingual facets;andM;* to relate to those segments of the market which show potential for futuregrowth and pave the way for the introduction of potentially viableinformation products and services;andM;* to aim, at least in soem projects, at generating a high level of demand inthe public sector, in order to help open up an important ready market;andM;* to make an active cotnribution to simplifying the formalities of access toservices, to improving their user-friendliness and to reducing regionaldisparities in the supply of and access to information services;andM;* to make use, wherever possible, of existing technological infrastructureand involve the supply of electronic information products and servicesavailable on-line and/or via other machine-readable media;andM;* to include follow-up and evaluation mechanisms which enable the transfer offindings.andM;Obviously, few products, if any, will meet all of these criteria, so eachwill have to be assessed primarily on its overall strategic impact on themarket as a whole.andP;  The use of the most advanced tools and the scope fortransfer of experience with a view to the supply of more easily used advancedinformation services will be the main factor for granting Community support.andM;The size and conditions of Community support will be determined by the typeand requirements of the project, taking into account the imperativerequirement not to distort competition.andM;Projects corresponding to the above criteria and submitted by groups ofindustry operators will receive an initial assistance calculated by referenceto actual needs, and normally limited to 25 percent of the development costs.andO;Community support will not necessarily take the form of a subsidy.andP;  It couldbe used to marshal other financial instruments such as reduced-interestloans, guarantees or venture capital.andM;Other projects which are of general interest but which are unlikely toattract private sector investment (e.g., databases containing strategicallyuseful information for public policy decisions or common infrastructures foreasier access to databases) could benefit from confinancing, shared betweenthe Community, users and member states.andP;  In such cases the Communitycontribution would be limited to 50 percent of costs except in certain cases(such as exploratory and feasibility studies undertaken at the Commission'sinitiative).andM;In parallel with these pilot and demonstration projects, the Commission willkeep up its activities already under way, notably in the framework of thefive-year program for the development of the specialized information market,to remedy the lack of scientific and technical database services in priorityareas such as information for industry and research, patents, materials andimage databanks.andM;The present Communication does not cover access to the information resultingfrom those Commission's activities which are financed through other schemesfrom appropriate budgetary lines.andM;Action in Favor of Libraries.andP;  Public spending for the benefit of librariesin the Community makes up 0.5 percent of total public expenditure (excludingmilitary expenditure).andP;  In addition to its irreplaceable culturalsignificance recognized by the Council in its resolution of September 27,1985, the library sector is assuming an increasingly important role as anintermediary, helping firms gain access to the wide range of databases andother sources of scientific, technical and commercial information available.andM;In parallel with the pilot projects envisaged here, the Commission will inthe course of 1988 prepare the launch of a special action in favor oflibraries in the European Community to encourage their interconnection andthe use of the new information technologies.andM;Facilitating User Access to Existing Information Services.andP;  The user isconfronted with both multiplicity and complexity in using existing databaseservices.andP;  It is advisable therefore.andM;1) To supply him with clear and objective information about the range ofservices available in the Community.andP;  The Commission intends to extend thecoverage of multilingual electronic directories (e.g., the DIANE GUIDE)available on its host service ECHO by adding other information sources(information brokers, specialized consultancies, etc.) which could helprespond to user needs.andM;2) To set up in the Community a number of help desks to tackle the technicaldifficulties in accessing international services.andM;The Commission will reinforce the help services and user assistance providedby ECHO.andP;  It will also look at ways to encourage collaboration betweeninformation intermediaries, by setting up a network of franchised advisers,so as to secure access to the best information services to reply to users'questions.andM;3) To promote actions to alert users to the abundance and quality ofavailable European information.andP;  Experience with Euronet DIANE has shown thatCommunity awareness campaigns helped to multiply by a factor of 30 over fiveyears the number of expert users of European on-line services.andP;  Such actionsare considered by information services suppliers as crucial to the success oftheir marketing operations.andP;  They are considered essential, in the view ofusers in business, industry and research, as a means of diseminatinginformation about available databases.andP;  They assume a particular importancein the light of the objective to extend the market to the millions ofpotential users represented by the professionals who lack expertise in theuse of information services in business.andM;The Commission will propose to the member states a coordinated campaign topromote the abundance and quality of European information available on themarket.andM;4) To reinforce the existing training structures.andP;  The problems of educationand training are directly linked to the promotion of electronic informationservices.andP;  The Commission believes that certain forms of Community suport forthis activity are justified (e.g., schemes to promote the use of the CommonCommand Language installed by a number of hosts in the Community).andP;  TheCommission will reinforce its assistance to users by increasing thetravelling training workshops organized by ECHO, by developing new automatictraining aids on the ECHO host service and by taking advantage of thetransnationally oriented pilot activities concerning training in theframework of the SPRINT program, as well as the remote teaching techniquesdeveloped within the DELTA program.andM;5) To help the user cross the multilinguistic barrier.andP;  The diversity oflanguage in the Community is one of the facets of its rich cultural heritage,and third-generation services will have to take full account of thischaracteristic if they are to tie into the internal market.andP;  Newtechnologies, in particular machine-assisted translation, may help inconstructing such services.andP;  The Commission intends to undertake a completestudy of the entire question of multilingualism, with a view to takingfurther, and if necessary reinforcing the schemes already in operation(Eurotra and Systran) to facilitate the incorporation of multilingualism ininformation services.andM;6) To strengthen the role of the European institutions as providers ofinformation.andP;  A special effort should be made to facilitate access toCommunity information through user-friendly systems and tools such as thosewhich have been developed within the INSIS program.andM;IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANandM;OF PRIORITY ACTIONSandM;General ApproachandM;The launching of pilot projects which will exert a catalytic effect on thedevelopment of the information market is only one of the mechanisms which areenvisaged to attain the objectives of the Commission's action plan.andP;  Otherschemes corresponding to the priority objectives will be set in motion eitherdirectly or through related Community policies (such as the setting up of theinternal market, the policy on telecommunications, innovation policy, etc.).andM;The Introductory PhaseandM;Because a complex policy can only succeed if it is carried out withflexibility, the Commission proposes to commence the implementation of itspriority actions with an introductory phase of 24 months, for which an amountof 15 million ECU for 1 989 and 20 million ECU for 1990 is deemed necessary.andM;During this phase the Commission will go on with its current work to improvethe market conditions for electronic information services.andP;  This includessetting up the European information market observatory, promotingstandardization, undertaking the legal work which will result in draftrecommendations or directives to be submitted to the council and completingthe guidelines covering the role of the public sector in the informationmarket.andM;In parallel, the Commission will step up its user support activity and willpropose to the member states a coordinated campaign which will aim to promotethe wealth and the quality of information available in Europe.andM;Finally, the Commission will launch a limited number of pilot ordemonstration projects.andM;The objectives and basic principles underlying the selection of projects havebeen worked out in consultation with representatives of the informationservices industry in Information Services Providers Group, representatives ofusers in Information Services Users Group and the senior officials of SOAG.andO;Calls for Declarations of interest will be published in the Official Journalin order to obtain proposals for projects from users and from the industry.andO;The selection of projects will be carried out by the Commission inconsultation with SOAG.andM;At the conclusion of this two-year phase, the Commission will transmit to theCouncil and to the European Parliament an evaluation report on the resultsobtained and on the basis of those results put forward guidelines for thecontinuation of actions until the end of 1992.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;The Council is invited to indicate its approval of the general objectives andlines of action proposed by adopting the draft decision at annex.andM;(1) COM(86) 205andM;(2) COM(87) 296andM;This article is from the Communication from the Commission together with adraft decision concerning the Establishment at Community Level of a Policyand a Plan of Priority Actions for the Development of an Information ServiceMarket.andP;
