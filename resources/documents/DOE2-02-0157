The tests evaluatethe ability of the radioactivity monitoring system sample lines to transmitradioactive elemental iodine during transient conditions. The sampleline was tested initially with manufacturing contamination left in theline; then was cleaned and retested to evaluate the effect of cleaningon transient performance. The sample line tested was of sufficient sizeto have acceptable performance during a nuclear reactor accident. Thetests were conducted in a laboratory where radioactive iodine could begenerated safely, test variables closely controlled, and test data measured.5 refs., 11 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
