Klein, the former owner of Merritt Commercial Savings andamp; Loan Association, and three of his former business associates were indicted by a federal grand jury in connection with the 1985 collapse of the privately insured thrift.    Merritt was among the largest of several troubled Maryland thrifts that were closed by state authorities during a crisis of confidence in a private, state-regulated insurance system that failed to protect depositors.    As previously reported, investigators found that Merritt had lent more than $50 million to companies controlled by Mr. Klein, his associates and partners. Some of that money went toward the development of a real estate empire, controlled by Mr. Klein and his partners, that did everything from hauling dirt to marketing condominiums, and to a hog-farming operation with a grain farm and a mill.    Mr. Klein, 45 years old, was charged in the indictment with 40 criminal counts, including conspiring to defraud, mail fraud, transporting stolen property across state lines and conspiring to operate a racketeering-influenced enterprise.    Mr. Klein's attorney, Andrew Jay Graham, said his client would &quot;plead not guilty to all counts&quot; and &quot;looks forward to his day in court.&quot;    If convicted, Mr. Klein faces a maximum prison sentence of 265 years and &quot;millions of dollars in fines,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox. The exact total of the fines haven't been determined, Mr. Willcox said.    Also indicted on the same charges were Eugene Hettleman, 64, and Milton Sommers, 62, who had owned a 10% stake in Merritt until May 1982, when they sold it to Mr. Klein and Robert V. Gibbs, who was also indicted.    Messrs. Hettleman and Sommers served on Merritt's board until the thrift collapsed. Both face the same maximum prison term and fines as Mr. Klein.    Arnold M. Weiner, an attorney for Mr. Hettleman, called the indictment of his client a &quot;tragic mistake,&quot; adding that he &quot;looks forward . . . to vindication in the court.&quot; Mr. Sommer's attorney, William F. Pendergast, said his client was being &quot;falsely accused&quot; and &quot;denies all allegations&quot; of wrongdoing.    Mr. Gibbs, 44, who held a 50% stake in Merritt until selling it to Mr. Klein in November 1984, was charged with 23 criminal counts, including conspiring to defraud, mail fraud, transporting stolen property across state lines and conspiring to operate a racketeering-influenced enterprise. He could receive a maximum sentence of 180 years, plus undetermined fines.    Mr. Gibbs couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Willcox, the federal prosecutor, said he is seeking to confiscate all profits the men made in connection with Merritt. He said he is seeking to recoup $23 million from Mr. Klein, $21 million from Mr. Gibbs and $300,000 apiece from Messrs. Hettleman and Sommers.    According to the indictment, Mr. Hettleman served as legal counsel to Merritt and, in that capacity, &quot;knowingly rendered legal opinions and prepared false documents&quot; in order to allow Messrs. Klein and Gibbs to commit the alleged fraud.    The indictment also charges that Mr. Sommers, while president of Merritt, &quot;used his position to approve and execute transactions&quot; that harmed the thrift and its depositors in order to enrich Messrs. Klein and Gibbs.    In addition, federal investigators found that Messrs. Klein and Gibbs deliberately inflated the true net worth of Merritt so they could siphon millions of dollars from the thrift in the form of dividends.    The indictment further alleges that the defendants issued misleading financial statements that caused customers to deposit funds into Merritt that were used for &quot;tens of millions of insider loans.&quot; The loans were made to real estate projects and other entities controlled by Messrs. Klein and Gibbs &quot;without collateral, without accurate appraisals and without standard underwriting documentation.&quot;    Mr. Klein's attorney, Mr. Graham, has previously defended his client's actions, contending that the loans were made to subsidiaries of Merritt, not to Mr. Klein personally. In an interview last spring, Mr. Graham contended that all the loans were approved by state regulators and that his client &quot;has no reason to explain or apologize.&quot;    After Merritt collapsed, Maryland placed it in conservatorship. Chase Manhattan Corp. acquired Merritt in late 1985 as part of a rehabilitation program for the state's thrift industry. </TEXT></DOC>
