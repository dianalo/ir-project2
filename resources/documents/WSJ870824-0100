Dewey Warren Holdings PLC, the British insurance group effectively controlled by Mr. Holmes a Court's Bell Group International Ltd., said it plans to raise #64.6 million ($104.4 million) through a rights issue. Proceeds from the share offering will be used to make &quot;acquisitions complementary to the enlarged group's existing businesses,&quot; as well as to strengthen capital, the company said in a statement.    Officials declined to talk about possible acquisitions. &quot;If I had specific plans I would have to disclose them,&quot; said Simon Carrel, Dewey Warren's finance director and deputy managing director of Bell Group International, which will hold 41.47% of Dewey Warren after the rights issue. &quot;I haven't got any comment to make about it. I don't wish to expand on that.&quot;    Dewey Warren was a sleepy little insurance broker when Mr. Holmes a Court agreed to buy a stake in the company last February. Since then, it has become an important London investment vehicle for the Australian financier. Last month, Dewey Warren bought a 5.19% stake in Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the British merchant bank, acquiring the bulk of the holding from the Kuwait Investment Office for #33.5 million of Dewey Warren shares. The transaction and rights issue will leave the Kuwait Investment Office, the investment manager for the Kuwaiti government, the second-biggest shareholder in Dewey Warren, with a 25% stake.    Mr. Carrel declined to comment on whether Dewey Warren plans to increase its Morgan Grenfell holding, which Dewey Warren officials described as the company's single-biggest investment. Morgan Grenfell and the Kuwait Investment Office declined to comment Friday.    Dewey Warren officials said the rights issue will make the firm a bigger player here. &quot;This is really putting together some major building blocks to move forward,&quot; said Philip Long, Dewey Warren's deputy chairman. Dewey Warren said it also will use proceeds to develop its &quot;financial-services activities,&quot; although at the moment, Mr. Long conceded, the group's primary interest in the area is its investment in Morgan Grenfell. The rights issue &quot;isn't the end, it's the beginning,&quot; he added.    Dewey Warren shares have been suspended on London's unlisted securities market since July 17, pending the announcement of details of the rights issue. The shares last traded at 280 pence. Morgan Grenfell shares were unchanged Friday at 550 pence.    ---   Hanson Buys Grenfell Stake   LONDON -- Morgan Grenfell Group PLC said that Hanson Trust PLC has acquired a 3.3% stake in the British merchant bank.    But Hanson, a British industrial group that doesn't have any major interests in financial services, may have purchased the shares only as an investment, analysts said. Hanson officials couldn't be reached for comment. A Morgan Grenfell spokesman said officials of the two companies haven't met.    Hanson joins numerous other parties that have built up stakes in Morgan Grenfell in recent months. Morgan Grenfell has been the subject of persistent takeover speculation since the British government in December began investigating Guinness PLC's takeover of Distillers Co. last year. Morgan Grenfell was Guinness's financial adviser during the bid. </TEXT></DOC>
