Mr. Hartog is chairman of Hartog Foods International, adistributor of juice concentrates and processed foods. Whenone of its banks cut its credit lines a few months ago,Hartog Foods found 12 others interested in winning itsbusiness. That led the company, whose annual sales are in therange of $150 million, to increase its borrowings.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We were pleasantly surprised. The competition was active,very aggressive,&quot; says the 64-year-old chairman, who choseChase Manhattan Bank, Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co. and alongtime Hartog lender, Bank of New York Co.   Although few companies are being courted by 12 banks, Mr.Hartog's success does reflect a changed financial climate.With big-ticket banking in the doldrums, major banks aretrying harder to woo small and midsized local businesses.   Once the backwater of corporate banking, the middle marketis one of the few high-margin lending businesses left, nothaving been taken over by securities firms that arrangecommercial paper or other offerings. Midsized companiestraditionally pay relatively high interest rates, and notmany default.   Moreover, the middle market is one of the last bastions ofrelationship banking, the tradition of long-lasting, mutuallybeneficial ties between a corporate borrower and its lenders.In re-emphasizing relationships, banks have come a long wayfrom the 1980s, when they financed raids against clients andmany saw old ties as old hat.   But banks aren't chasing after middle-market companies theway they used to chase leveraged buy-outs and commercial realestate loans. While increasingly lending to the middlemarket, banks also are raising their standards in hopes ofweeding out shaky borrowers. &quot;Banks are scared to make badloans,&quot; says Steven Sklar, chief financial officer ofBiocraft Laboratories Inc., who recently arranged a loan witha new lender for the generic-drug maker in Fair Lawn, N.J.&quot;But once you convince them you're a good risk, it's verycompetitive.&quot;   A similar shift toward midsized businesses occurred in theearly 1980s, after Third World lending died out; banks suchas Citicorp set up far-flung loan-production offices totarget midsized businesses all around the country, only tolater retrench after local companies shunned them. Now,banks' renewed emphasis on customers in their own back yardsis part of a broader shift away from large corporate andinternational banking. Many lenders are building up branchnetworks in an attempt to become regional powerhouses ratherthan global players.   &quot;Banks are returning to their roots,&quot; says Robert Greene,chief credit officer at First Interstate and president ofRobert Morris Associates, a lenders' trade group. &quot;And thatmeans more competition in the middle market.&quot;   The competition is rising all across the country. BarnettBanks Inc., of Jacksonville, Fla., recently said it hopes toreduce its real-estate portfolio and target small-businesscustomers. In Chicago, First Chicago Corp. and ContinentalBank Corp. have shrunk their big-business operations andincreasingly are going after midsized businesses. In LosAngeles, First Interstate Bancorp has made a similar shift.   Nowhere is the competition hotter than in the New Yorkregion, home to the country's largest pool of midsizedcompanies. Those targeted are the roughly 11,000 firms withsales between $10 million and $250 million. Like HartogFoods, many are family-owned. The tens of thousands ofsmaller firms aren't being ignored, either. &quot;It's fertileground just by the sheer size alone,&quot; says Joseph Maloney, asenior vice president at Bank of New York.   So, the giant banks are on the march. On Feb. 11, ChemicalBanking Corp., which already has 51% of New York's middlemarket, blitzed the local business community, sending out 800officers to call on some 3,000 companies. The hawkersincluded Chairman John McGillicuddy and President WalterShipley, who usually aren't out pounding the pavement.   Chemical, which recently merged with Manufacturers HanoverCorp., preceded the blitz by giving out Nestle Crunch barsmocking the credit crunch. It also held an early-morningmeeting that was more like a pep rally than a bankers'meeting. &quot;We've softened up the targets with over 9,000ounces of chocolate,&quot; Frank Lourenso, Chemical's chief ofmiddle-market lending, told his staff. &quot;Now, let's hit thebeaches.&quot;   Greenberg's Bakery is the kind of business Chemical iswinning. The cake maker is going after the wholesale-dessertbusiness to balance out its holiday-dominated sales, and itwants to modernize and add capacity, says owner SethGreenberg. But Citicorp, his longtime bank, turned him downfor a $500,000 loan. Chemical came through.   Chemical's New York rivals are active, too. Bank of NewYork is beefing up its middle-market staff. Chase Manhattan,which got its foot in Hartog's door through blindsolicitations, has a new direct-mail campaign. After a periodof retrenchment, National Westminster Bancorp has set toughproduction quotas for officers. And in New Jersey, FirstFidelity Bancorp. sent out all its calling officers one dayin November after getting a jump on its rivals in cutting itsprime rate, the basic rate on business loans.   Even now, however, banks are underplaying the middlemarket in favor of big-ticket lending, in the view of WilliamLawrence, a Pace University economist and director ofManhattan's Small Business Development Corp. Given thelayoffs by many large employers, &quot;small business could be thebiggest potential growth area for the banking industry,&quot; headds.   With middle-market loans tied to the prime rate and theprime rate declining more slowly than many other rates,profit margins &quot;haven't been pinched&quot; despite the pickup incompetition, says Robert Burke, head of Midwest banking atFirst Chicago. Banks are eager to lend to the middle market,but also eager to maintain the profitability of the business.In fact, the average rate charged midsized companies widenedsignificantly last year to nearly a full percentage pointover prime, according to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York firmthat analyzes commercial loans. Now, such loans are yieldingmany banks three percentage points over their cost of funds.&quot;There's not much else that earns those returns,&quot; says StevenMiller, an analyst at Loan Pricing.   Middle-market profits are high even though the banks'costs are high; after all, it costs more to lend 100 clients$1 million each than to lend one client $100 million. On theother hand, the 100 clients reduce risk by diversifying theloan portfolio -- if the bank doesn't push into new marketswithout knowing much about them.   Right now, many bankers say, loan demand fromcredit-worthy borrowers is light -- and that's partly why NewYork banks are wooing each other's clients. &quot;We are bookingbusiness, but it's at the expense of our competitors,&quot;Chemical's Mr. Lourenso says. &quot;The overwhelming majority ofour customer base is in a `How do I survive the recession?'state of mind.&quot; Many companies have trimmed inventories andheld back on capital spending.   In a January survey, the National Federation ofIndependent Business found demand for credit at record lows.And only 4% of the business people surveyed called financingtheir main problem; in the 198082 credit crunch, that figuretopped 30%. &quot;Banks have the money to lend. They just don'thave the customers,&quot; says William Dunkelberg, the group'schief economist.   For some small and midsized companies, however, finding anew lender has become difficult. Most banks have tightenedlending standards and are demanding additional documentation.Many also prefer to make loans for the purchase of equipmentor hard assets that can serve as collateral and generaterevenue.   Even some borrowers understand why banks are tighteningup. James Roenitz, chairman of Landmark Group, a Plymouth,Wis., holding company for some midsized businesses, says hisbanks have raised their credit standards, but he doesn'tbelieve they are too conservative. In the past, he says,&quot;many were too damn liberal.&quot;   However, some companies need financing desperately. NormanSpector, chief executive of Norsal Corp., says EuropeanAmerican Bank pulled the plug on a $300,000 revolving creditline. That action, he adds, could have sunk the Long Island,N.Y., manufacturer of radar equipment, which has 25 employeesand annual sales of $2 million. Chemical came up with arevolving credit but refused an additional short-term loan tohelp meet seasonal cash-flow needs. However, Chemical letNorsal postpone payments on the principal of the revolvingcredit for three months.   Some borrowers are miffed by banks' delays. MarcoMarchetti, owner of a distributor of foreign publicationscalled Speedimpex Inc., wanted to buy a property afteroutgrowing a leased building in Long Island City. He needed a$1.2 million mortgage quickly. But Citicorp, his bank for 25years, resisted making a loan until the company's fiscal yearended, even though its sales were up 15%. Mr. Marchetti hadalready been approached by Chemical, and he called its loanofficer. Within a week, he had a mortgage there, and severedall ties with Citicorp.   &quot;Citicorp thought I was bluffing,&quot; Mr. Marchetti says.&quot;They were shocked.&quot;   Although he suspects Citicorp isn't much interested inlending to midsized companies, the bank denies that. In anycase, Citicorp is one of New York's chief lenders to smallcompanies, those with $1 million to $10 million in sales. Itis starting an ad campaign directed at them.   A problem much like Mr. Marchetti's faced Walter Williams,chief financial officer of Zilog Inc., a fast-growingsemiconductor maker in California's Silicon Valley. WhenZilog wanted a $20 million credit line, &quot;our prior bankwasn't that aggressive.&quot; But after he sought out other banks,he quickly had about half a dozen pursuing his business. Hegave it to First Interstate and Bank of Boston.   In making loans, many banks are hoping for much more thanjust collecting interest payments. When Weiss, Peck andamp; Greer,a New York investment firm, was seeking $17 million to helpfinance its acquisition of a Fort Wayne, Ind., processor ofhealth-care claims, four banks &quot;were aggressively going afterthe business,&quot; says Peter Pfister, a partner in the New Yorkfirm. Still, some wanted up-front fees of 2% of the loan andrates one to 1.5 points over prime-terms associated withhighly leveraged loans, which this was not. Harris Trust andamp;Savings in Chicago bid aggressively at prime plus 0.25 pointwith upfront fees under one point. It won the business.   But Harris knew that the cash-management needs of the firmbeing acquired ran to $1.2 billion annually. And Harris isnudging customers to use it for a range of services.Moreover, corporate business often leads into a customer'spersonal business, such as credit cards, certificates ofdeposit and money management.   By cross-selling other businesses that don't require a lotof capital, lending can be made more profitable &quot;as you getyour tentacles into the company,&quot; says Diane Grossman,banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. First ManhattanConsulting Group, a financial-consulting firm, estimates thatlending alone earns a return on equity of about 10%, butadding the deposits, cash management and other fees can raisereturns above 20%.   &quot;We don't want just the loan,&quot; Chemical's Mr. Lourensosays. &quot;We want the whole relationship.&quot;   Although lending banks usually don't demand business suchas a company's checking account, most customers willinglygrant it. &quot;There's no reason to have two banks,&quot; Mr. Spectorof Norsal says. After his firm got its loan from Chemical, hegave Chemical his payroll account, checking account andvirtually all the company's banking business.   Aside from convenience, medium-sized companies considerthe relationship with their banks worth more than saving afew dollars on a fee. Margaret Johnson, chief financialofficer of Peer International Corp., a New York musicpublisher, says she wouldn't play one bank against another --a tactic common in large-scale deals -- because it might sourthe relationship, even though Chase and Chemical are vyingfor her business. &quot;For the long pull, I don't believe it'swise,&quot; she says. &quot;We want to form strong bonds.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
