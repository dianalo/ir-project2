(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis today ridiculedRepublican rival George Bush's pledge to be an ``educationpresident,'' telling a Kentucky rally the nation needs a presidentwho will focus on education ``not just during election years.''   Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, was wrapping up a seven-statecampaign swing today with appearances in Louisville and Raleigh,N.C. He has stressed his message of economic opportunity throughoutthe trip, and today focused on education as a vital part of his``good jobs at good wages'' formula.   ``We need a president who will be out nation's No. 1 advocatefor educational excellence, not just for some of our children, butfor all of our children,'' the Massachusetts governor told anoutdoor breakfast rally along the banks of the Ohio River.   ``Not just during election years, but every year,'' he said.   Dukakis repeated his pledge to sponsor loan-forgiveness andother programs to encourage college students to become teachers andhis pledge to provide student loans to any high school graduate whois accepted by a college or university.   ``No youngster who completes high school and is qualified to docollege work should ever be denied that opportunity because offinancial need,'' Dukakis told the rally.   Dukakis brought his campaign to Kentucky after criticizingBush's day care plan and the Reagan administration's handling ofthe Pentagon scandal and slumping regional economies.   Bush, in turn, challenged the Democratic nominee's contention inhis acceptance speech last week that the race is about competencerather than ideology. The vice president and certain Republicannominee called such talk a ruse that ``just masks over his far-leftphilosophy.''   Bush also planned to hit hard on the issues where Republicansconsider Dukakis the weakest _ foreign policy and defense _ when hegoes on the road next week, his campaign said.   Dukakis was to take part of his time today to meet withcandidates for state director posts in several Southern states andalso with supporters of vanquished rivals Jesse Jackson andTennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.   Another former rival, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, stood byDukakis' side Friday as the nominee addressed a rally in theIllinois capital of Springfield.   ``You need a partner in the White House, a federal partner whowill work with you, who will not accept second best or secondrate,'' said Dukakis, accusing Reagan of ignoring regions of thecountry whose economies are struggling.   Dukakis joked about finishing behind Simon and Jackson in theIllinois primary and urged those at the rally to vote Democratic inNovember.   ``We've got to join together around some very fundamental valuesthat unite all Democrats, unite all Americans.''   As he had earlier in the day in Flint, Mich., and Sturtevant,Wis., Dukakis said laissez-faire management by the Reagan DefenseDepartment had contributed to the Pentagon procurement scandal.   ``My friends, in a Dukakis administration we're not going tosurrender our national security to greed and corruption,'' Dukakistold the Springfield rally. ``We're not going to use our defensedollars to line the pockets of Washington consultants. We're goingto pay for the tanks and equipment and training the men and womenof our armed forces need and deserve.''   Earlier, at a Wisconsin news conference, Dukakis said Bush'splan to give a $1,000 tax credit to families who need day care wasinferior to a Democratic-sponsored plan before the Congress.   ``I don't know anyone who is serious about child care who thinksthat makes sense,'' Dukakis said of the Bush plan.   But he refused to endorse the $2.5 billion price tag thecongressional bill carries.   Bush, appearing Friday at a day care center in a Washingtonsuburb, touted his program, saying the problem is too diverse andcomplicated for a centralized agency to handle. ``You have to havechoice, parental choice, family choice, and you have to havediversity,'' he said.   Bush also told reporters the issues in the presidential campaignare still ``all blurred out there right now.''   ``The Democrats had a good convention, but offered nospecifics,'' Bush said. ``My opponent's suggestion that ideologydoesn't matter just masks over his far-left philosophy.''   Bush planned to go on the offensive next week with speeches inChicago on Tuesday and Corpus Christi, Texas, on Thursday.   ``He will keep discussing issues. And when the issues come infocus, the polls will start closing,'' Campaign manager Lee Atwatersaid, referring to the 18-point lead Dukakis has had over Bush inpolling since the Democratic National Convention.   At the White House, meanwhile, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater accused Dukakis of being ``for a weaker defense,'' acontention that the Dukakis campaign quickly challenged.   Also on Friday, President Reagan approved a 30-day extension ofSecret Service protection for Jackson, at a cost Reagan estimatedat $600,000. Fitzwater said the extension addressed Jackson'sconcerns about threats against his life but would not last throughthe fall campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
