The latest victim, Ames Department Stores, was yesterday's volume leader, plunging 3 3/8 to 18 1/2 on more than 3.8 million shares. Ames has its own particular problems, namely mysterious inventory shortages it's been unable to resolve in the past six months.    But sharp declines also have beset such highfliers as Gap Inc., down 19% since Aug. 7 amid reports of flat same-store sales at its trendy Banana Republic unit, and Limited Inc., down 23% since Aug. 14, due partly to slow growth in its large-size division.    Other straws in the wind:   Last week Goldman Sachs analyst Stephen Mandel took Wal-Mart Stores, another growth favorite, off Goldman's &quot;Focus List&quot; of stock picks because of its lofty price-earnings ratio. He urged caution on retailers because of &quot;slow real wage growth, our best lead indicator of consumer spending, and the relative strength in the production sector of the economy.&quot;    In the past few weeks, analysts at Merrill Lynch have lowered their earnings estimates for several retailers and apparel makers, including Bernard Chaus, Consolidated Stores, U.S. Shoe, Family Dollar Stores, Super Valu Stores and Zayre.    Retail analyst Bob Buchanan of L.F. Rothschild yesterday downgraded J.C. Penney based on slowing growth prospects. He said high installment debt and recent declines in real disposable personal income have put the brakes on consumer spending.    &quot;Generally, what's happening in retail stocks is that sluggishness on the part of the consumer is making it very difficult for retailers to post sizable sales and earnings increases,&quot; Mr. Buchanan said. Nineteen retail stocks he tracks declined 8.6% from Aug. 6 to Sept. 8 while the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.7%.    Weakness among retailers is potentially worrisome to some money managers such as William Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff Associates. &quot;I'm watching this like a hawk,&quot; he said. &quot;If retailing rolls, it's going to take out the rest of the economy. And that's where the hook is in this market. If you lose momentum in this economy, you've wiped out the reason to own stocks.&quot;    Mr. Harnisch was a seller of Limited before its Aug. 11 second-quarter earnings report disclosed sales growth of 18%, continuing a slowing trend.    But the stock really got pounded last week after the company said August sales rose 14%, and only 2% on a same-store basis. To make matters worse, one of its buyers was quoted on the front page of this newspaper saying the company missed the boat this season on short skirts, a big fashion trend.    A Limited spokesman noted that August sales suffered because the Labor Day weekend fell unusually far into September this year.    Marion Schultheis, a retail analyst at IDS Financial Services, raised the question: &quot;If a company as strong as the Limited had weak August sales, is that indicative of all retailers or a sign of something to come?&quot;    Ms. Schultheis believes the answer is no, that investors have overreacted and stocks of leading retailers such as Limited, Gap and Wal-Mart are cheap at these levels. However, Gap has reportedly dropped hints that its August same-store sales may also have fallen below the 10% growth some expected.    Gap doesn't report quarterly sales and wouldn't comment. But its Aug. 13 earnings release said it doesn't expect &quot;maturing&quot; Banana Republic stores to exceed their first-year sales, partly due to the opening of additional stores in the same markets.    Robert Raiff of C.J. Lawrence asserted that retailing stocks historically hit their low points in the fall. Because their results are always skewed toward the year-end Christmas season, he explained, analysts can maintain typically optimistic estimates for most of the year. &quot;But as they get toward the moment of truth, they have to start adjusting&quot; downward, he said.    Robert Roth, who follows retailers for Merrill Lynch, noted that the stocks were big beneficiaries of disinflation because it helped both their profit margins and their customers' spending power. Now, he said, the falling dollar and rising interest rates could signal an end to disinflation and reverse those favorable trends.    Mr. Roth believes that such large retailers as Sears, Roebuck, K mart, and Penney are experiencing &quot;lackluster&quot; sales. But he believes tight cost controls will fatten their profit margins.    Another analyst believes Ames and other regional discount chains such as Jamesway and Zayre were helped in the past by failures of discounters such as E.J. Korvettes and W.T. Grant and are now being hurt by tougher competition from K mart.    Mr. Harnisch covered half of his short position in Limited earlier this week. But he believes the burden of proof remains on the company to demonstrate that it can meet its goal of 30% to 50% annual earnings growth as sales growth declines with each passing quarter.    So far, few brokerage analysts have dropped their per-share earnings estimates on Limited. Some, such as Margart Gilliam of First Boston, remain at $1.75 for 1987 and $2.40 for 1988. But another analyst thinks this year's number looks more like $1.60, on the low end of the company's growth target, compared with $1.21 in 1986.    Mr. Buchanan of Rothschild said, &quot;There's a lot of negative news out there on retailers, and it probably gets worse before it gets better.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
