Some girlsdon't understand they have a right to say &quot;no&quot; to sex. Some boys don'tunderstand they have no right to ignore &quot;no.&quot;;    It's up to adults --parents, teachers, school administrators -- to communicate clearly that when agirl asks her boyfriend to stop and says &quot;I want to go home. . . . Please takeme home,&quot; the acceptable response is not, &quot;If you love me, you will,&quot; followedby rape.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'NO' MEANS EXACTLY THATSANTA TERESA RAPE CASESHOWS THAT SCHOOLS NEEDTO TEACH ABOUT SEX ABUSE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     That didn't happen at Santa Teresa High School, when a 17-year-old studentwrote in an English class assignment that she'd been raped by her boyfriend.;   Her teacher reported the girl's charges to Children's Protective Services,as required by law, and urged her to report the rape to the police. Thedistrict attorney's office is investigating, and police have recommendedprosecuting the boy for striking the girl after she made the rape charge.;   But the lesson Santa Teresa students have learned is that if you believe youwere raped by a varsity football player, you'd better shut up about it; ifyou're accused of rape, say the girl's a slut.;    School administrators tookno action to protect &quot;Amy Walker&quot; from on-campus harassment by her formerboyfriend except to move her out of a class they were both assigned to, and,on Monday, keeping him away from her summer school class.;    &quot;There are twosides to every story,&quot; Principal Mike Welch told a reporter.;    It seemsstrange that a girl would continue to date the boy who'd raped her, but thishappens even with adult victims, who accept abuse as their due. And this was achild.;    When school officials take a neutral stand -- or one tilted towardthe alleged rapist -- it sends students a message that sexual abuse is thevictim's fault.;    In the future, a rape crisis counselor will be called into help a victim, the principal says; the Rape Crisis Center's 24-hour phonenumber (408-287-3000) will be published in the school paper.;    That's notenough. High schools need to teach about sexual abuse, and to decide how toprotect students from attackers who are also classmates.;    Young people needto learn: It's not OK if you've been dating for a long time; it's not OK ifyou're drunk. It's never OK to force sex on a partner. It's rape.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910716  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  402  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 16, 199100198009,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
