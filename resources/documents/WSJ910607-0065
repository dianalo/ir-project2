Hisclients, the press, his traders -- all wondered if he knewabout any talk of merger between Chemical Banking Corp. andChase Manhattan Corp., or any other big New York banks forthat matter.   Merger of banks serving the same market has become a hottopic. And nowhere is it seen as more needed than among thebig &quot;money center&quot; banks of New York City, where the costsavings from reducing overlapping branches and departmentscould be enormous. Though the Chase-Chemical talk wasdismissed by Mr. Smith and most others as just marketspeculation, Wall Street is convinced mergers are coming.</LP><TEXT>   That prospect, Morgan Stanley bank analyst Arthur Soter isreported to have said Wednesday, makes it sensible toconsider the stocks of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chemical,Chase and Bank of New York Corp., even though he isn'trecommending them on earnings outlook. (Mr. Soter won'tcomment on this account of his conversations with moneymanagers.) First Boston's Mr. Smith sent clients a memosaying talks with bank executives convince him that theannouncement of a consolidation &quot;is inevitable, and may evenbe imminent,&quot; imminent meaning in the next 12 months.   And banks themselves seem more ready now. &quot;A year ago itwould have been a demoralizing loss of face to go to theboard to merge with the guy across the street,&quot; says RobertHedges of the MAC Group, a consulting firm. Now, &quot;it'sconsidered the bold, exciting thing to do. It's in the air.&quot;   But it's not on paper. The speculation in banking circlesis rapidly becoming a matter of, Will they or won't they? Thebanks on Mr. Soter's list all decline to comment on the talk.But a look at some of the elements weighing in banks'decisions shows how they are being simultaneously tuggedtoward a merger move even as other forces lead them to resistone.   The most compelling argument for taking the plunge is costsavings. Past bank mergers within the same market, such asWells Fargo andamp; Co.'s acquisition of Crocker National Corp. in1986, suggest that savings of between 10% and 20% of thecombined banks' non-interest expenses are possible. For MannyHanny and Chemical, which are close in size, that could mean$800 million or so of savings, without much loss in revenue.   This would have big effects on the banks' financialstrength, and thus on their stock-market values. Taken to thebottom line, after taxes, the $500 million extra net incomemight be given a stock-market multiple of nine, estimatesLarry Frieder, a professor at Florida Aandamp;M University. On thatbasis, it would more than double the current $4 billion valueof the combined companies' stocks. &quot;It's so compelling thatstaying independent probably won't be allowed to continue,&quot;Mr. Frieder says.   The stock market no longer ranks most money center banksas high as it used to, note investment bankers-who are, ofcourse, eager to put deals on the books. One notes thatChemical and Manny Hanny are now 24th and 26th largest in theU.S. by a market-value measure, compared with 15th andseventh in 1980.   The stock-market valuation is important because a highstock price can become the currency for acquiring a healthybank. It also opens the way for raising more equity cheaplyand thus boosting the equity-to-assets ratio, whichregulators consider in allowing expansion. Then there is the&quot;opportunity cost&quot; of not having the capital to compete forgovernment-assisted bank and thrift mergers. In January,Citicorp chairman John S. Reed noted to securities analyststhat if his bank weren't grappling with so many problems, itcould be taking advantage of a number of growthpossibilities.   Mr. Smith of First Boston adds that banks are facing anera of sluggish loan growth, and &quot;internal cost cutting isnot seen as being as effective in building profits&quot; asconsolidations are.   What's going on in banking today is a case of the stronggetting stronger. After Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.won the bidding for the failed Bank of New England Corp. withcapital from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., it floated a newissue of stock. Because of the capital infusion and winningbid, Fleet's stock doubled from the time it began planning anew stock offering to when it brought it to market, saysRichard Barrett, a Salomon Brothers managing director. &quot;Thedifference was an extra $120 million.&quot;   Bankers are under pressure either to show markedly betteroperating results or get involved in merger talks. &quot;If not byJuly 4, Labor Day or at least sometime this year, regulatorsare going to increase the pitch of their comments privatelyto the banks,&quot; says a lawyer who works closely withregulators. E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the FederalReserve Bank of New York, said in January that &quot;I will bevery surprised -- perhaps disappointed&quot; if within 12 months&quot;one or two more mergers among the largest banks in the U.S.are not already a reality.&quot;   Not least of banks' concerns these days is fear of beingleft at the starting gate. &quot;All the CEOs say let me know ifothers are getting close,&quot; says a Wall Street firm's head ofbank mergers. &quot;Their nightmare is waking up one morning andreading in the paper that two competitors are close to adeal.&quot; He says big banks' boards of directors are tellingtheir chief executives to keep them posted on even informaldiscussions.   Yet weighed against all these reasons for merger arevarious deterrents, some more tangible than others. One isbanks' wariness of each other's loan portfolios. At Chase andChemical, nonperforming real estate loans have continued torise, firstquarter results showed. At Manny Hanny,credit-card delinquencies rose. Bank of New York's reportshowed a jump in nonperforming loans for highly leveragedtransactions.   Also imparting trepidation is the haunting reminder of the1987 merger of RepublicBank Corp. and InterFirst Corp. inTexas. Republic's loan problems soared and ultimately broughtthe merged company, First RepublicBank Corp., to its kneesfor a government bailout.   Since none of the big New York banks appear to be indanger of failing, there also isn't the pressure for any toimmediately abandon their game plan. When loan problemssurfaced last year, &quot;several of these banks took someexcruciating cost cutting steps,&quot; says Charles Peabody, aKidder, Peabody andamp; Co. analyst. &quot;They want some time to see ifthose steps will bear fruit.&quot;   Besides this, all four of what are considered the mostlikely merger candidates in New York -- Chase, Chemical,Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Bank of New York -- have CEOsor heirs apparent who are years away from retirement. And,&quot;There's still that element of wishful thinking that they canscrape through and manna will fall from heaven,&quot; contends oneinvestment banker. He figures it will take another quarter ortwo for the air to clear on loan quality.   Despite all the reasons to pause, Chemical and Manny Hanny-- the deal most expected -- &quot;are closer than they were sixmonths ago and especially closer than they were a year ago,&quot;says one analyst, who adds that &quot;both chairmen are talkingmore openly to me now about the possibility.&quot;   Citicorp, the country's largest banking company, is notconsidered a likely merger candidate now. The quality of itshuge real estate loan portfolio remains a question mark,analysts say. And, midway through a big cost-cutting program,it may be too internally focused to map out a merger.   J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp. alsoare unlikely candidates. Analysts say their strategies aremore clearly defined, and as wholesale banks they would notbenefit from the reductions of retail overlap. Republic NewYork Corp., the other large New York City banking company, isalready quite profitable on its own and has been growing byacquiring thrift-institution deposits.   Putting any of the other four big banks together would befar from painless. Thousands would lose their jobs; it'sestimated that up to 20% of the 45,000-person work force of aChemical/MHT combination would be eliminated, for instance.And in terms of costs, paying for branch closings, severanceand such could eat up as much as 75% of one year's expensesavings.   Outside capital would probably be needed to get such adeal approved by regulators. Mr. Hedges of MAC Group figures$300 million to $500 million of added capital would be neededto carry out a Chemical/MHT merger.   The money is available. Investment bankers who have testedthe waters say attracting even as much as $1 billion for adeal is clearly possible. &quot;Capital would come out of thewoodwork for the right deal,&quot; says Jeffrey Peek, managingdirector at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.   Virtually any combination of the four likely candidateswould create the second largest bank in the U.S., supplantingBankAmerica Corp. Even without improved profits or a capitalinfusion, Chemical merged with either Manufacturers Hanoveror Bank of New York would rank eighth in stock-marketvaluation among bank holding companies, according to SNLSecurities. A Chemical/Chase union would be sixth. Thepossible addition of up to $500 million in after-tax earningsthrough cost reductions would have a huge impact; Chemicallast year earned $291 million and Manny Hanny, $139 million.   The retail banking market in New York would no longer beso dominated by Citicorp. A Chemical/MHT combination wouldhave 9.9% of the New York area deposits, according to PSI, aTampa, Fla., bank statistics firm. That would be close toCitibank's 11.1% and nearly twice Chase's current share. Inconsumer loans, other than credit cards, the two would hold a7.9% share, again well ahead of Chase but several percentagepoints behind Citibank.   At the same time, the corporate finance presence of aunion of any two of the four would make the resultinginstitution a formidable competitor. &quot;J.P. Morgan is eatingeveryone's lunch,&quot; says one investment banker. &quot;If you puttwo of the other New York banks together and add $1 billionin capital, you've got someone who can compete with Morgan.&quot;   While the banks have had little to say publicly about themerger talk, one executive was unusually open about it thisweek. At a Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. institutional investorconference, the audience was all ears on Wednesday whenThomas Johnson, president of Manufacturers, laid out a cogentargument for within-the-city mergers -- one of his reasonsbeing the &quot;bestial competition.&quot; But when asked what mighttrigger a merger, he shrugged and said he didn't know.   The spark could come from Bank of New York, suggestsanalyst Thomas Hanley of Salomon Brothers. Having alreadydemonstrated the art of the unfriendly takeover in thebanking industry through its 1988 acquisition of Irving BankCorp., BNY &quot;could put a bear hug around either Manny orChemical that would send those two flying towards eachother,&quot; he says. An official of Bank of New York declines tocomment other than to say that it is in the mood foracquisitions, hasn't ruled anything out, and set the stage inthe first quarter to get its problems behind it and build astrong balance sheet.   William Gregor of MAC Group believes that &quot;the thingthat's holding {banks} back is weighing the potential benefitfrom a combination with the pain of bringing the institutionstogether.&quot; Others surmise that the banks would like either toraise some more capital or to show stronger earnings beforethey sit down to figure whose shareholders get the betterdeal.   In any event, it will be more difficult to wring out costsavings in a merger of banks of near-equal size. Keefe,Bruyuette andamp; Woods and Arthur Young andamp; Co. jointly studied theissue and found that, while past mergers have wrought savingsequal to 35% of costs of the acquired institution, the figuredropped markedly for combinations of equals in the samemarket. Then the savings were more like 12% of one bank'scosts, unless one of them clearly was emerging as dominant.   It is for that reason that some consultants expect thatoutside investors could play a pivotal role, forcing thetough decisions that the merged banks themselves might beslow in taking. While that outside capital would presumablybe there as a long-term investment, its owners would wanttheir bank to be able to benefit quickly from furtherconsolidation in the banking and thrift industries.   As Prof. Frieder puts it, &quot;They're missing opportunitiesin the marketplace. If Manny Hanny and Chemical had gottentogether three years ago, think what they could be buyingnow.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
