 It is widely criticized for its slowness, andit is sneered at for its handling of color screens at certain angles.andP;  Buteveryone uses it, and no one dares ignore it.andP;  Every vendor that doesn'talready use PostScript has plans for incorporating PostScript into itsproduct line (though some vendors are still not ready to announce theirplans).andP;  Alternative page description languages like Interpress and PCL,although they might once have looked like challengers, are now relegated tolow-end or niche markets.andP;  To all appearances, PostScript has becomefundamental technology for the publishing industry.andM;Or has it?andP;  Although the publishing industry has gone for PostScript in a bigway, the computer industry is still debating the question.andP;  Everyone is nowcoming to realize that you really want to use the same imaging model (and thesame fonts!) for screen display and for output.andP;  If you do not do this, youwill inevitably have disparities between what you see on the screen and whatyou get on hard-copy output.andP;  You will also pay a price in the extraprocessing overhead involved in converting one imaging model into another.andM;Screen imaging models.andP;  There are two ways that you can get the same imagingmodel for screen and output: you can drive the output imaging model back tothe screen, or you can drive the screen imaging model out to the printer.andO;Adobe has done the former with Display PostScript.andP;  As we have beenpredicting for some time, Microsoft and Apple are doing the latter by turningtheir respective screen imaging models into output printer languages.andM;PCL Level 5.andP;  The other factor that must be considered is, of course, thelong-awaited Level 5 extension to Hewlett-Packard's PCL LaserJet commandlanguage.andP;  As important as PostScript is for publishing, PCL printers (mostof which are used for relatively straightforward office tasks) greatlyoutsell PostScript printers.andP;  And, largely for cost/performance reasons, alot of users publish on PCL printers.andM;When PCL finally gets scalable fonts and support for HPGL graphics it willbecome a much more credible language for less demanding publishingapplications.andP;  The installed base will make it impossible to ignore.andM;Driven from the desktop.andP;  Cal Bauer, president of Bauer Enterprises, createda storm of controversy among the high-end publishing crowd attending theSeminars when he challenged the publishing industry to recognize thathigh-end publishing, although a specialized application in its own right, isdriven by what people are doing on their desktops.andP;  The standards of theoffice become the standards of the publishing industry, not the other wayaround.andP;  The reasons are simple.andM;* Cost.andP;  For the foreseeable future, the lowest-cost publishing systems (atevery level of quality) will be developed using mass-marketcomponents--desktop computers designed for office use.andP;  These systems willalso use specialized equipment where there are no good mass-market solutions,but that will be less and less necessary.andP;  System vendors (and theircustomers) who ignore this reality face a competitive disadvantage.andM;* Customers.andP;  Those segments of the publishing industry that take in workfrom customers must accept the data formats that their customers are using.andO;If a customer has proofed his work on a low-cost laser printer, the high-endsystem must match that result--nor because it is &quot;correct,&quot; but because it iswhat the customer expects.andM;The playing field for this contest is the entire desktop computer industry;publishing is only one small corner of it.andP;  The major players will beMicrosoft, Apple, Sun and (we think) Next.andM;The publishing industry is perhaps not yet accustomed to seeing itself as asegment of the larger computer industry.andP;  There are still many who seepublishing as a separate industry, even as a craft all its own.andM;We agree with Bauer that this no longer is the true state of affairs.andM;But publishing does have a critical role to play in the computer industry,because it is a demanding application that pushes the limits of thetechnology.andP;  In the coming contest, the industry will need to assure that theimaging models that ultimately win are adequate to the requirements ofhigh-quality publishing.andM;Apple QuickDrawandM;We believe that it was Steve Jobs who first convinced Adobe to go into thepage description language business.andP;  It was certainly Apple that madePostScript a publishing standard; it became one because Apple introduced areasonably priced laser printer that had text and graphics capabilities thatalmost no high-end typesetter or imagesetter could match.andM;Linotype wisely decided to make a high-resolution version of the LaserWriterfor applications needing higher quality, which meant that people could relyon the LaserWriter as a proofer.andP;  This established a set of expectations thatcould only be met by using PostScript applications and PostScript printers.andM;However, since Jobs left, Apple has become increasingly less single-minded inits support for PostScript.andP;  it has concentrated instead on enhancing its ownQuickDraw screen imaging software.andP;  It has already indicated that it will beadding support for 24-bit color to QuickDraw this spring.andP;  At the Seminar,Apple indicated that it will also add (at a later date) support for scalableoutline fonts.andP;  This will make QuickDraw much more attractive for output aswell as screen display.andM;Apple has already released a QuickDraw laser printer.andP;  Unfortunately, all theLaserWriter IISC has done in the publishing arena is point up how limitedQuickDraw now is.andP;  But as QuickDraw gets better, it will become more viableas an alternative to PostScript.andP;  By next year, we expect that users who liveentirely within an Apple world will find QuickDraw output devicesincreasingly attractive alternatives to PostScript.andP;  This could, in fact, getrather messy.andP;  Apple users may have to pay close attention to what fonts(PostScript or QuickDraw) were used to produce which documents.andP;  (More onthis--and the likely way out--later.)andM;Microsoft GPIandM;When Microsoft designed OS/2 and Presentation Manager, it assumed that itwould have to cope with a wide variety of display screens and output devices.andO;It therefore took pains to isolate the application software developer fromspecific display devices.andP;  The application software developer writes to thePresentation Manager Graphic Presentation Interface (GPI).andP;  &quot;Device drivers&quot;written by the manufacturers of the various devices (screens, printers, etc.)andO;translate GPI commands into the specific commands required to drive theirdevices.andP;  (Microsoft Windows for MS-DOS has a similar approach, but it uses asimpler Graphic Device Interface [GDI] graphic language.)andM;Writing good device drivers turned out to be a lot more difficult thanMicrosoft had anticipated, so it has enlisted the help of Bauer Enterprises.andO;Bauer has developed a toolkit that makes it far easier to write MicrosoftWindows (MS-DOS) and Presentation Manager (OS/2) device drivers.andP;  It willsell this toolkit to people who want to prepare device drivers to supportspecific devices.andP;  Then Bauer will test and certify the results.andP;  Driversthat pass Bauer certification will be distributed by Microsoft.andM;Existing devices.andP;  GPI is necessarily independent of any particularresolution, since it must support Hercules, CGA, VGA, Moniterm Viking and ahost of other PC displays, as well as all the printer types that anyone mighttry to hook up.andP;  In fact, Presentation Manager makes no assumptions about anycapabilities of the device it is driving.andP;  Rather, it can query the printeror screen (through its driver software) about its capabilities and thenrender images accordingly.andM;This provides an interesting contrast with Adobe's position on PostScript,which is that every PostScript device must implement the full PostScriptlanguage.andP;  This stance virtually guarantees that PostScript will be reservedfor top-of-the-line products, while microsoft's approach spans all marketlevels.andM;Scalable fonts, dumb devices.andP;  In order to provide greater functionality forlow-end raster devices (dot-matrix printers and inexpensive laser printers),Bauer will build into its toolkit support for outline-to-bitmap font scalingroutines and the ability to print the font bit maps generated by theseroutines in graphic mode on a dot-matrix or laser printer, or to downloadcharacter bit maps to a laser printer that supports this.andM;GPI native mode.andP;  In addition, Microsoft is currently working with severalprinter manufacturers who are developing printers that can interpret nativeGPI format data.andP;  If OS/2--Presentation Manager does become as important inthe office and publishing markets as we expect, native-mode GPI printers arealmost inevitable.andM;GPI shortcomings.andP;  At the moment, GPI has several shortcomings as a printerlanguage (and as a truly flexible screen imaging language).andP;  The most seriousof these is that, like the current implementation of Apple QuickDraw, itrequires presized bit-mapped fonts.andP;  It has no means of dealing withresolution-independent outline fonts and/or scaling fonts.andP;  It is also waybehind PostScript in such crucial areas as support for halftoning ofcontinuous-tone images and color images.andM;These shortcomings, combined with the fact that the Microsoft managersresponsible for OS/2 and Presentation Manager clearly do not understandeither the font or the graphic issues, led many Seminar attendees to concludethat GPI is hopelessly behind PostScript as an imaging language for seriouspublishing applications.andM;We think that it would be terribly short-sighted to write GPI off socavalierly.andP;  Microsoft is rapidly becoming aware of what it needs to do, andit is now moving rapidly to address the font issues in particular.andP;  At theconference, it issued what amounted to an open &quot;let's talk&quot; invitation to allcompanies with font technology.andP;  One font technology vendor commented to us:&quot;at this Seminar, scalable fonts moved from 'this is a problem we have toaddress some time' to 'this is an urgent priority' on Microsoft's prioritylist.&quot;andM;GPI printers.andP;  Since Microsoft has not yet selected any font technology, theinitial GPI laser printers will have to solve this problem on their own.andP;  QMSis expected to have one of the first such devices (see p. 27).andP;  Since QMSowns Imagen, we expect that QMS will use the Imagen font technology in itsprinter.andP;  (Imagen, by the way, holds license rights to use the Linotype fontlibrary.)andM;Hewlett-Packard PCL Level 5andM;HP admitted at the Desktop Publishing Conference in September 1987 that itwas working on a &quot;Level 5&quot; extension to its Printer Command Language (PCL).andO;This will include support for HPGL vector graphics and Compugraphic fontscaling technology.andM;PCL Level 5 is still not available.andP;  When it is, it will offer a relativelystraightforward upgrade path for the hundreds of thousands of LaserJet users.andO;Compugraphic has also said that it will offer compatible PCL Level 5typesetters.andP;  Since it now offers Adobe PostScript as well, CG is banking onthe expectation that service operations who process input from desktopsystems will need to be compatible with both the LaserWriter (PostScript) andthe LaserJet (PCL Level 5).andM;However, the additional capabilities of PCL Level 5 may well require moreprocessing power and/or more memory (and hence higher cost) in a PCLcontroller.andP;  Until the language and the upgrade path are announced, it willbe unclear exactly how much impact PCL Level 5 will have on the market.andM;PostScriptandM;Adobe, of course, is not sitting still.andP;  It continues to enhance PostScript.andO;And it continues to add licensees.andP;  At the Seminars it announced:andM;1.andP;  Linotype's Saturn.andP;  Linotype announced the RIP III Postscript controller(also called the Saturn controller) for L200P, L300 and L500 imagesetters.andO;It is not exactly a quantum leap upward in speed, since it is based on a68020, as is the current Atlas design.andP;  But it will roughly double (in somecases, even triple) the processing speed for halftones, due tobetter-optimized algorithms and larger working memory.andP;  Linotype points outthat halftoning speed is especially critical in processing color separationfilms.andM;The Adobe algorithms for processing text and line graphics had already beenfairly well optimized in the Atlas controller, so little improvement will befound there.andM;2.andP;  RISC processors.andP;  Adobe does have high-speed PostScript controllers basedon several different RISC processors.andP;  (Only Weitek wa mentioned by name.)andM;We consider this to be very significant.andP;  Adobe implementations running onhigh-speed processors such as the Weitek chips would significantly undercutthe position of clones that are relying on Weitek (or other RISC chipimplementations) for their competitive advantage.andM;3.andP;  Font library.andP;  Adobe announced that it has licensed Monotype,Compugraphic and Varityper to prepare fonts in PostScript format.andP;  Thisshould open up the Adobe font library considerably and address an oft-voiceuser request.andM;We will discuss this in more detail shortly when we turn our attention totype fonts.andM;4.andP;  Font character sets.andP;  Adobe also announced that two new Adobe Originaltype fonts will be available in a much larger &quot;professional&quot; character setthat will include fractions, small caps, old style numbers and ligatures.andM;5.andP;  Color improvements.andP;  In the color session, Adobe announced substantialimprovements to its color screening algorithms and hinted at discussions withHell on the crucial Hell patents in this area.andP;  (See &quot;Color&quot; later in thisarticle.)andM;6.andP;  Canon joins the fold.andP;  Canon has licensed Adobe PostScript and will bringout a family of Adobe PostScript printers.andP;  This is of particular interestbecause Canon makes a wide range of printers, from the ubiquitous 8-ppm SXengine (used in both the LaserWriter II and LaserJet II) up to 50-ppmmachines--including color as well as monochrome printers.andM;Canon has also licensed the Phoenix PostScript implementation.andP;  Our initialassumption was that Canon had dumped Phoenix in favor of Adobe.andP;  But it soonbecame clear that Canon will probably offer both Adobe PostScript and PhoenixPostScript implementations and let the market decide which one wins.andM;Sun Microsystems.andP;  As we have mentioned several times in the past, weconsider Sun Microsystems to be the most important PostScript &quot;clone&quot; vendor.andO;Sun has implemented its own version of Display PostScript as the basis forits News windowing system.andP;  The major piece of the puzzle Sun has beenmissing is scalable font technology.andP;  This piece fell into place when itacquired Folio this past summer (see &quot;Font Wars&quot;).andM;At the Desktop Publishing Conference in September, Sun's president, ScottMcNeally, allowed as how it would be natural for Sun to offer printers thatcould be driven directly from its workstations and file servers (a la Next).andO;In March, Sun and Folio announced open licensing of the Folio technology,which threatens to undercut Adobe (see below).andM;Yet at the Seminar, Sun's Bill Joy was surprisingly conciliatory towardsAdobe.andP;  We think that it should be clear to both that they are really in thePostscript boat together.andP;  They both face a challenge from OS/2--PresentationManager--GPI, and from X Window in the unix world.andP;  It would be interestingto see the two most important PostScript implementors find a way to worktogether for the common good.andM;Font warsandM;If things are moving rapidly on the page description language front, theyhave been moving at breakneck speed in the closely related arena of fonts andfont technology.andM;Six months ago at the Desktop Publishing Conference in September:andM;* PostScript was the fact of life for anyone needing more sophistication thanPCL provides.andM;* The Adobe font library and the Adobe font technology represented the mostimportant barrier to would-be PostScript clones.andP;  A complete, fullyLaserWriter-compatible implementation of PostScript is no trivialaccomplishment.andP;  Relatively few companies have truly succeeded in pulling itoff.andP;  But having accomplished this, clone vendors found that it was notenough.andM;Full Adobe compatibility (the ability to output a file prepared for an AdobePostScript printer) means full font compatibility as well as PostScriptlanguage compatibility.andP;  But Adobe fonts are encrypted.andP;  They cannot be usedon non-Adobe controllers.andP;  And, without knowledge of the proprietary Adobeencryption and hinting schemes, neither could other vendors prepare fontsthat could be read into Adobe controllers and treated as if they were Adobefonts.andP;  The only way of getting non-Adobe fonts into an Adobe controller wasto encode them as normal PostScript graphics.andP;  These &quot;Type Three&quot; fonts takeup appreciably more storage, are filled by the Adobe controller usingdifferent routines (which can make them look very different), and do notcontain the &quot;hints&quot; required to render text sizes well at modest resolutions.andM;* Adobe announced that it would hire on the spot any programmer who couldbreak the encryption routine.andP;  This, it turned out, was not a good bet.andM;Six months later, the picture has changed completely.andM;Bitstream writes Adobe format fonts.andP;  At the Seybold European Conference inDecember (less than three months after the &quot;we'll hire anyone who can breakthe encryption? boast), Bitstream announced that it had broken the encryptionand would sell all of its fonts in encrypted (but un-hinted) Adobe format.andM;At the March Seminars it showed the first 300 faces converted to encryptedAdobe (Type One) format.andP;  This allows users to read Bitstream Adobe-formatfonts into Adobe controllers.andM;RIPS reads Adobe fonts.andP;  In the product demonstration area, PostScriptclone-maker Raster Image Processing Systems (RIPS) gave impressivedemonstrations of its ability to use Adobe's encrypted Type One fonts in itsnewest clone product.andP;  It had a large number of Adobe faces, including Stoneand Sonata, and was printing with them in response to visitors' requests.andM;We imagine that the rest of the PostScript cloners are watching to see whatAdobe's reaction will be.andP;  For the past several years, Adobe's officialposition has been that its fonts are only licensed for use in Adobecontrollers.andP;  If Adobe does not attack RIPS with a lawsuit promptly, everycloner will feel free to follow RIPS' pathway.andP;  If Adobe does sue, it invitesyears of litigation and might lose in the end.andP;  (We should note, however,that Adobe has a great many more resources than does RIPS--a real asset whenit gets down to lawyer talk.)andM;Folio's F3.andP;  Sun formally introduced its TypeMaker outline-generation andTypeScaler font-scaling technology.andP;  We reported the details last month (Vol.andO;3, No.andP;  7).andP;  There are two essential components to the Folio technology:andM;* TypeMaker is a program that automatically converts font outlines fromexisting formats into the Folio F3 format, automatically inserting thescaling hints as it goes.andM;TypeMaker will be licensed to any type foundry that wishes to convert itsfonts to F3 format.andP;  Thus far, Monotype, Linotype, Berthold, Bigelow andamp; Holmesand ITC have signed licenses.andP;  Other vendors will almost certainly followsuit.andM;* TypeScaler.andP;  The second program will accept F3 format fonts from anysource, scale them and generate the bit maps required for screen display orprinter output.andP;  The routine appears to be relatively fast and to producegood output.andM;As mentioned earlier, Sun will use the TypeScaler technology as part of itsNews windowing system in its own workstations.andP;  In typical Sun fashion, thetechnology will be freely licensed to anyone else who wants it.andP;  The F3 fontformat will be published, so that font foundries can create F3 format fontson their own even if they do not license TypeMaker.andM;F3 font libraries.andP;  It appears that a significant number of the major typefoundries (including those that represent the core of the Adobe font library)are licensing TypeMaker.andP;  (The fee is reportedly $200,000 plus royalties onall F3 format fonts sold.)andM;Because the process is automatic, the foundries say that they will beconverting their entire libraries to F3 format in relatively short order.andP;  Weexpect that within a year, more faces will be available in F3 than in Adobe'sformat.andP;  To avoid chaos, Linotype has promised that it will retain the samecharacter sets and the same font metrics for F3 format fonts and for AdobePostScript fonts.andM;Using the fonts.andP;  TypeScaler will also be licensed freely to anyone who wantsto use the technology for screen display or output.andP;  This means, for example,that a PostScript clone vendor could build the TypeScaler technology into hisproduct, then tell his customers to buy F3 format fonts on the open market.andM;In response to our question on the subject, Linotype agreed that there isnothing to stop a user who has a PostScript clone printer or typesetter thatcan read F3 format fonts from going to the computer store and buying LinotypeF3 format fonts to run in his machine.andM;As far as we can tell, this means that if clone vendors adopt the Foliotechnology, their customers should be able to buy ITC, Linotype or Monotypefaces that match the Adobe versions of the same faces.andM;Font technologiesandM;Other developments on the font scene:andM;* Bitstream became the third vendor to show a fast, compact screenrasterizing algorithm (following The Company's Nimbus-Q [see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  6]and Sun's F3 TypeScaler).andP;  It calls its program Speedo.andP;  The Speedo demos wesaw were not quite as polished as Nimbus-Q and TypeScaler, nor as fast, butBitstream is still optimizing its code.andM;It is really a four-horse race.andP;  Agfa Compugraphic's Intellifont software hasbeen used for screen rendering in G.O.andP;  Graphics' and Archetype's productsfor some time.andP;  We believe it is neither as fast nor as compact as Speedo orNimbus-Q, but CG is surely hard at work remedying that.andM;* Letraset announced that it will market a font design program developed byA.B.andP;  Vista under the code name Fred Font Machine.andP;  Running on any Macintoshwith 1 MB of memory, it can autotrace the edges of scanned logos, inerthints, screen fonts and downloadable PostScript fonts.andM;Among its features are the ability to tie several weights of type into asingle Mac font family and to produce colorized type.andP;  It can also exportletterforms in EPS and PICT formats, so they can be further manipulated byprograms like Illustrator 88.andP;  Before its final release, the program willalso support the LetraStudio format, naturally.andM;It is not as sophisticated a program as, say, Ikarus.andP;  But based on our lookat the pre-release version, it will be fairly easy to use.andP;  Letraset willprobably release it at the August Macworld Expo.andP;  Pricing has not been set,but it is likely to be near the $500 mark.andM;Sorting it outandM;All in all, the world looks remarkably different after the Seminar than itdid after the Desktop Conference in September.andP;  The closed world of AdobePostScript and Adobe fonts is rapidly giving way to an open world.andP;  It looksas if things will shake out as follows.andM;1.andP;  There will probably be several important screen imaging models/outputdescription languages:andM;* PostScriptandM;* QuickDrawandM;* GPIandM;* PCL Level 5 (output printers only, not screen display)andM;At the moment, PostScript still looks like the only system-independentlanguage.andP;  It will be supported by both Microsoft and Apple.andP;  It is unlikelythat Apple will support GPI printers or Microsoft will support QuickDrawprinters.andM;2.andP;  Fonts will be decoupled from imaging and output technologies.andP;  Most userswill have access to fonts from a variety of sources.andP;  Most font foundrieswill sell their fonts in more than one format.andP;  They will try to make surethat all versions of a font are compatible with each other.andM;3.andP;  A few font formats and font technologies will prevail.andP;  The likelyfavorites are:andM;* Adobe PostScript formatandM;* Sun/Folio F3 formatandM;* Apple QuickDraw format (which we believe has been determined, but not yetannounced).andM;* Microsoft GPI format (which we believe has not yet been determined and willprobably be licensed from someone else).andM;* (Prossibly) Compugraphic Intellifont format as used in PCL Level 5LaserJets.andM;The open question at this point is Microsoft.andP;  As we mentioned earlier,everyone will be courting Microsoft.andP;  Everyone, we believe (with the possibleexception of Apple), will eventually try to open up their font formats to getas broad acceptance as possible.andP;  Although both Bitstream and The Companyhave licensed their technologies broadly, we are still unclear as to how theywill fare as the font market is reshaped and redefined over the next year orso.andM;Implications.andP;  In short, we are heading towards a world in which there willbe a modest number of font formats, each used with one or more graphicimaging technologies.andP;  Font vendors will most likely &quot;publish&quot; their fonts inmany (or all of these formats, and will undertake to ensure that these fontsare compatible--same character sets, same character shapes, same fontmetrics--from format to format.andP;  Users will be able to buy fonts in theformat of their choice from a wide variety of sources.andM;This is not the &quot;universal vendor-independent font format&quot; that many peoplehave dreamed of, but it is a lot better than what we have had!andM;Intellectual propertyandM;But implicit in this dream is a problem most users treat far too lightly.andP;  Ithas become increasingly evident over the past year that digitized type fontsenjoy very little legal protection--especially in the U.S.andP;  Typesettermanufacturers have always stolen each other's font designs by having a typeshop set a sample alphabet on film (complete with separator characters whichmark character baselines and side-bearings), then redrawing or redigitizingthe character outlines.andP;  (A time-honored technique that Bill Garth, thefounder of Compugraphic, once referred to as &quot;the traditional method.&quot;)andM;Digitized type has made the task a lot easier.andP;  Professor Michael Harrison ofBerkeley described a program he had worked out which reads Adobe characteroutlines from an Adobe controller and redigitizes them.andP;  Harrison, who hastaught cryptography at Berkeley, says that he could have broken the Adobeencryption in a week.andP;  He chose the digital equivalent of &quot;the traditionalmethod&quot; after Adobe refused to licenses its fonts to him.andM;The program is available on tape distribution to anyone who wants to use itfor research purposes.andP;  It is available for $10,000 to anyone who wants toput it to commercial use.andM;Another attendee told us that he has broken the Adobe encryption and is ableto read Adobe font outlines at will.andM;Shaky ground.andP;  In general, the legal status of digitized fonts is not clear.andO;The current U.S.andP;  copyright law provides that unless a design can existindependently of its utilitarian aspects, it cannot be copyrighted.andP;  It alsosays that &quot;mere lettering&quot; is explicitly not eligible for protection.andM;Shrink-wrap license agreements may give some protection.andP;  But then again,they may not.andP;  Shrink-wrap software license agreements have been ruledinvalid in a few jurisdictions, and legal theorists are divided on whether a&quot;take it or leave it&quot; license printed on a mass-market product constitutes avalid contrast.andM;Why worry?andP;  Not all of the users at the Seminars appeared very worried by allof this.andP;  But unless font designers and font foundries can get paid for theirwork, there will not likely be many new faces--or many high-quality faces.andM;A bill to change this situation failed to pass in the last session ofCongress, partly due to opposition from users of type designs--that is,typographers--who feared that infringement lawsuits would be brought againstthem for using the widely copied designs based on Times Roman and Helvetica.andM;The British model.andP;  There is some hope that a special copyright act for typedesigns, based on the British model, might be able to pass.andP;  The British lawprovides that purchasers and users of stolen designs cannot be prosecuted,but that sellers and importers are fully liable.andP;  The protection lasts onlyten years and carries a mandatory-licensing proviso.andP;  It also specifies ajury-of-peers approach to determining whether a design is original or copied,and it has a grandfather clause that exempts all designs that existed at thetime the law was passed.andM;Still, Congress may not be sympathetic.andP;  (It is estimated that roughly 20,000Roman-alphabet font designs have been created since Gutenberg's time.andP;  Shoulda Congressman understand why we need more?)andP;  In that case, what should a fonthouse do to recover its investment in a new design?andM;Bitstream takes the position that its font designs are intertwined withexecutable code, which is copyrightable.andP;  We have our doubts about how usefulthat approach is.andP;  It surely marks bit-for-bit copying as piracy.andP;  But it isstill vulnerable to the &quot;traditional method.&quot;andM;We think that the ultimate answer will have to lie in the domain ofmarketing, not law.andP;  Good designs that are aimed at the mass market--pricedlow, packaged conveniently, distributed widely and compatible with lots ofscreens and printers--will generate more revenue than equally good expensive,encrypted, narrowly marketed fonts that only work with one brand of printer.andM;The stakes.andP;  This is the time when the future of both page descriptionlanguages and digitized type is being determined.andP;  Things are moving rapidly,and many of the important players have a less-than-perfect understanding ofthe issues.andM;The publishing industry will simply have to cope with this situation, sincethe standard-setting process is being driven by the much wider officecomputing market.andP;  in Cal Bauer's view, the best thing for publishers to dois let Apple and Microsoft (and HP, IBM, OSF, etc.) know what functions andfeatures are needed for publishing work, so that the standards we get will begood ones.andM;Output and FontsandM;In the world of output and fonts, PostScript remains the most magical word.andO;The selection of fonts available for PostScript recorders is exploding, asare the number of PostScript-capable output devices and the array of tasksthat they can perform.andP;  It seems that everyone is running PostScript faster,or cheaper, or with a greater selection of options; but most important, justabout everyone is doing it.andP;  PostScript products appeared in profusion on theexhibit floor.andP;  Still, man cannot live by  PostScript alone.andP;  As Seminarsattendees saw in several booths, even the relatively slowly LaserJet ismoving up, thanks to software developers who continually find new ways topush it beyond its original limits.andM;AutologicandM;Determined to offer PostScript to its users, but not to give up thetypesetting speed for which it is famous, Autologic has come up with aninteresting solution.andP;  It will support both an ICL RIP and a PostScript RIPon the same imagesetter, switching between them on the fly, to produce outputup to the size of a broadsheet newspaper page.andM;Adobe licensee.andP;  The PostScript RIP is an Adobe Atlas design, packaged into apair of PC-style cases and named the APS-PS PIP.andP;  Inside are an 80-MB diskfor font storage, a floppy drive for loading in software, interfaces toRS232,  Centronics and LocalTalk (Ethernet is an extra-cost option) and aninterface to the APS-6 imager.andP;  The Atlas controller is configured with 12 MBof memory, enough to form a 1016-dpi page bitmap for an 8.5&quot; X 11&quot; page.andP;  Youcan stuff more memory in if you want to push bigger PostScript imagesthrough, up to 18&quot; X 21&quot; with 48 MB.andM;With the basic 12-MB memory complement, the APS-PS costs $25,000.andP;  Maxed outat 48-MB, the price rises to $37,500.andM;Mixed pages.andP;  As the system now stands, when you sent a rasterized PostScriptimage to the APS-6, the APS will store it until the entire image has beenreceived, then record it onto film at the full speed of the typesetter, withno start-stop operation.andP;  Using a multiplexer, you can switch betweenPostScript pages and ICL pages.andP;  This means that inserting a PostScript jobinto the stream does not force all the ICL jobs to wait on the Adobecontroller; imaging always proceeds at full speed.andM;Autologic is working on another approach, too.andP;  When the Autologic GraphicsIntegrator (AGI) is ready, it will be able to take in bitmaps from the Adobecontroller and integrate them with GICL bitmaps onto the same page.andP;  The AGIwill be able to switch between bitmaps on the fly; the APS imagesetter willsee only a continuous stream of bits and will never know whether they camefrom a PostScript controller or a GICL controller.andM;Fonts.andP;  Autologic has begun converting some of its fonts into PostScriptoutlines.andP;  These are the open-format Type Three fonts (the same kind youcould generate with Fontographer).andP;  The firm &quot;has no announcement at thistime&quot; regarding a licensing agreement with Adobe to begin producing Type One(encrypted and hinted) fonts.andP;  Translation: they're still negotiating.andM;Birmy GrpahicsandM;Although the largest attraction at Birmy's table was the hefty GraphicEnterprises PageScan 2 printer, Birmy was also basking in the glory of RIPS'sannouncement that it could read Adobe fonts (see page 34).andP;  Birmy hasinstalled about 30  Birmy-Setter systems, we were told, even though the finalrelease of RIPS software has not been delivered to the customers.andM;The Graphic Enterprises engine is based on the laser optics from an Ultrerecorder, modified to image onto an electrostatic drum.andP;  Thus the engine canrecord on large sheets of plain paper, up to full 18&quot; X 24&quot; newspaperbroadsheet size.andP;  (The PageScan 2 comes with 18&quot; X 24&quot; and 11&quot; X 17&quot; papertrays; other sizes can be fed by hand.)andP;  It is rated up to 800 X 800-dpiresolution, but at the show was being run at a more conservative figure of600x600 dpi.andP;  It runs faster at lower resolutions, and the difference inquality between 600 and 800 dpi would not be perceptible in most textapplications.andP;  It might be worth the tradeoff for halftones, though.andP;  Thesamples we saw had crisp type and line graphics, but no halftones.andM;Although several of its users think the quality is good enough for finaloutput, Graphic Enterprises is advertising the engine only as a proofingdevice, to be on the safe side.andP;  It can be driven either by the RIPSPostScript controller sold by Birmy (the same one used in the BirmySetter) orby LaserMaster's CAPcard.andP;  The CAPcard uses a proprietary command language,rather than PostScript.andM;What price plain paper?andP;  Birmy is charging $47,500 for a completeprinter/controller PageScan 2 installation.andP;  Upgrading the controller'smemory from 8 MB to 12 MB adds $4,500; substituting a 330-MB SCSI drive forthe standard 145-MB one tacks on an extra $1,500.andP;  To put these prices inperspective, Birmy charges $34,600 for a 2400-dpi typesetter based on the72-pica Ultre film recorder ($49,500 if you need the 94-pica version of theUltre).andP;  However, since the PageScan 2 is a plain-paper device, there wouldbe no costs for film-processing equipment if you used it as your final outputdevice; a Graphic Enterprises official estimated the cost of consumables at4-5 cents per page.andM;BitstreamandM;In addition to showing Speedo, the fast screen-font scaling program,Bitstream showed the latest version of its Fontware Installation Kit.andP;  Thisversion is noticeably friendlier than previous ones, uniting most fontinstallation operations under a single menu-based interface.andP;  The firstapplication that will use Fontware Version 3.0 is WordPerfect 5.0.andM;ChelgraphandM;Chelgraph has licensed the Hyphen PostScript software and runs it side byside with its own ACE language interpreter in the Chelgraph Modular RIP.andO;However, that's old news (we covered it at IPEX); the new news concernsChelgraph's graphics front end.andM;LCGS.andP;  Chelgraph unveiled its Low Cost Graphics System (based on a Microtekscanner and a Sun workstation with gray-scale display) at IPEX last fall.andO;Since then, it has continued to develop the graphics editing functionality.andM;The LCGS always stores the full-resolution scanned image on disk, bringing alower-res subsampled version to the screen.andP;  Any adjustments to an image madeon the screen have no effect on the underlying database until the image isstored.andP;  You can always go back to your original data.andM;In addition to the cropping, scaling and tone-range adjustments shown atIPEX, Chelgraph has added several other image-editing functions:andM;* paintbrushes.andP;  Four brushes, of adjustable size and shape, are available.andO;In addition to painting with fixed values of gray paint, a brush can be setto pick up pixels from one area of the screen and copy them to another,allowing you to replicate objects or blend backgrounds.andP;  As you paint, boththe detailed blowup window and the main viewing window are updated.andM;* one-level undo.andP;  You can undo the effect of the most recent operation.andM;* rotation.andP;  You can rotate an image in 1 [deg.] increments.andP;  If you haveapplied several rotate commands, the undo function will take you back by onecommand.andP;  A cancel-rotation command is available to restore the original,unrotated version.andM;* global sharpening.andP;  Unsharp masking can be applied to the entire image.andO;The percentage of sharpening to apply can be specified.andM;Line work.andP;  The LCGS handles line art with much the same approach.andP;  It offersthe standard line, arc, polygon and free-hand-curve drawing tools one wouldexpect of a drawing program.andP;  In addition, it uses four levels of gray foranti-aliasing a scanned line drawing, which is particularly useful whenenlarging the drawing.andM;Outputformat.andP;  The system's output is in the correct format for input to theChelgraph GIM (Graphics Integration Module).andP;  In particular, the output isformatted for a particular output resolution and screening frequency.andP;  It isnot rasterized (that's what the GIM does), but the data that is passed to theGIM has the optimum amount of contone dat for the screening process.andP;  Whenthe image is to be reduced in size, the LCGS throws away any excessinformation; for enlargements, the LCGS will interpolate new data points sothat the GIM always sees exactly what it needs.andM;GIM.andP;  The GIM is a fast dot-generation subsystem for the Chelgraph ModularRIP.andP;  In addition to screening contone image data, it can merge bitmaps fromother sources--such as RIPped text--and output the combined page image to afilm recorder.andP;  Alternatively, it can be used to pre-rasterize images andstore them on disk for later output.andP;  While on the disk, these images can bebrought to a screen for previewing or pulled back into the GIM for additionalprocessing.andM;In order to get the speed it wanted, Chelgraph was forced to write its owndisk operating system software.andP;  But it does not want to face charges ofrunning on a proprietary operating system, so Chelgraph has stated that itwill give the source code for the operating system to any OEM that wants it.andM;Compugraphic Font TechnologiesandM;Although CG mainly wanted to trumpet its Type Director (a program to generatesoft fonts for HP LaserJets, and to manage the bitmaps on your PC's disk [seethe Report on Desktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  6]), it also reported thatversion 2.1 of the Intellifont scaling algorithm has been adopted by IBM forits DisplayWrite 5/2 Composer product.andP;  This is a high-end word processingprogram for the PC that was written for IBM by Beyond Words.andM;The Font CompanyandM;The Font Company offers the URW type library as unhinted, downloadablePostScript type for the Macintosh.andP;  It currently has more than 300 families(out of about 1,500) available and claims to be adding roughly 150 eachmonth.andM;Instead of using the PostScript &quot;set line&quot; command as an approximation ofcurves and adding hints, as Adobe does, The Font Company uses the &quot;set curve&quot;command.andP;  This approach makes a difference at resolutions greater than 300dpi; small but significant design elements such as curved serif ends arepreserved.andP;  The price for this greater faithfulness to the original is diskspace: The Font Company's font files are about 50% larger than thecorresponding Adobe ones.andM;The Font Company also sells its fonts in Encapsulated PostScript form formodification in Adobe Illustrator or Aldus FreeHand.andP;  Each family of fourweights costs $149.95, or $129.95 for the EPS outlines; families of twoweights generally run $129.95, or $99.95 for the EPS.andM;The Font Company, 12629 N. Tatum Blvd., Suite 210, Phoenix, AZ 85032; phone(602) 996-6606andM;FX UnlimitedandM;FX is the U.S.andP;  marketing arm of Thermoteknix Systems, of Cambridge, England.andO;It offers two complementary products: the LazaGram laser printer controllerand the LazaGram Reporter, a video-capture system.andM;LazaGram.andP;  Thermoteknix has devised a way to increase the apparent halftoningresolution of a Canon CX or SX laser printer engine.andP;  Like the Intel VisualEdge board, which is based on the DP-Tek technology, FX micro-modulates thescanning laser (by increasing the data rate to 1500 dpi) when it is layingdown a halftone.andP;  At such a high dot rate, the xerographic drum in theprinter cannot resolve individual dots, so the effect is that the electriccharge on the drum is varied in a continuous fashion.andP;  As a result, toner islaid down on the paper more smoothly, with more intermediate gray values.andM;Combined with original screening algorithms, the result can be very smoothhalftones.andP;  When printing text or line art, the FX controller leaves theoutput signal alone.andP;  We were impressed with the image quality that FX canput out.andP;  It is at least the equal of the Intel product.andM;However, our experience has been that, while a micro-modulated image (fromeither FX or Intel) looks great on the original laser printer output, anoffset-printed reproduction does not come out quite as well.andP;  The offsetcamera and printing press cannot keep those tiny micro-modulated dotsseparate, so that the shadow areas tend to turn solid black.andP;  The highlightsget bleached out.andM;We have no hesitation recommending this technique wherever the laser printerwill be used to generate final output: demand printing, presentations and soon.andP;  We do not think it is effective for generating camera-ready art,however.andM;LazaGram can process images in TIFF, GEM or PC Paint-brush formats.andP;  Sincethe special processing is done as part of printer output, there should be nocompatibility problems with any PC applications.andP;  FX Unlimited has priced theprinter controller and software at $695.andP;  (The LazaGram also requires a TallTrees J-Laser or a LaserMaster CapCard to generate the printer bitmap.)andP;  Inaddition, there is a programmer's tooklit, to help developers integrate theLazaGram into their applications, for $99.andM;LazaGram Reporter.andP;  The complementary product from FX is a monochrome imageinput system.andP;  The Reporter uses a standard video camera (or VCR orstill-video camera) and frame grabber.andP;  It then performs pixel interpolationto boost the image resolution--it fakes new data between video raster linesby averaging the data on either side.andP;  Coupled with variouscontrast-enhancing calculations (such as an unsharp masking convolution), theresult is a fairly usable image that can be output to the LazaGram printercontroller.andM;The Reporter also offers standards global brightness and contrast controls.andO;It does not, however, let you the highlight, midtone and shadow valuesindependently.andP;  Nonetheless, the image quality of the LazaGram Reporterdriving a LazaGram-enhanced printer is quite usable for many purposes.andM;The software and frame grabber card for the Reporter are priced at $4,495.andM;High SkyandM;High Sky has now brought to the U.S.andP;  market the same design station that itfirst introduced at the Seybold European Publishing Conference (see Vol.andP;  18,No.andP;  7).andP;  The product goes by the resounding moniker of The Master and theOctopus.andM;* The Master is a massive worktable, elegantly designed so that either one ortwo artists can use it.andP;  It houses both a Mac II (with full 8 MB memory and a32-bit-color nuVista display) and a 386 PC (also with 8 MB of memory and a32-bit Vista display) with graphics tablet.andP;  However, both computers are wellhidden behind woodwork--this product tries to accommodate computerphobicartists.andM;Although a variety of graphic design software can run in the Master'scomputers, High Sky is especially fond of Lumena, a high-end paint programfrom Time Arts that runs on the PC.andP;  On the Mac, the system comes withPageMaker and Illustrator 88.andM;* The Octopus is a multiport input/output waystation.andP;  It can take input fromhigh-end color scanners, from Aesthedes systems, Quantel Paintboxes, Iris 4Dworkstations, or from applications running in the Master's computers.andP;  It cansend output to Scitex recorders (via Handshake), to Iris ink-jet printers, toDupont's 4Cast proofer or, via the OctoRIP, to an Ultre recorder.andM;Octopus is actually a '386-based computer equipped with 8-16 MB of workingmemory (it needs the full 16 MB to support the 4Cast), a 350-MB SCSI disk anda Vista 32-bit color controller driving a 21&quot; Mitsubishi display.andP;  It has itsown image positioning, sizing and tiling software, controlled by a mouse andkeyboard.andP;  It also has color balancing software, designed to equalize thecharacteristics of the various devices it sends output to.andP;  However, it isnot intended to be a color production system; it is part of an advertisingdesign tool.andM;* The OctoRIP is the Hyphen software RIP running in the Mac II.andP;  It is intwo-way communication with the Octopus (through a Tops network connection)and so can rasterize a PostScript file from any source that talks to theOctopus, and can in turn deliver it to any output device on the Octopus.andP;  Ina typical configuration, though, it will deliver output directly to an Ultrefilm recorder at 3000 dpi.andP;  We were told that the software could rasterize anA4 page at 2500 dpi in about 4 minutes.andM;So far, High Sky has installed six systems in Holland.andM;U.S.andP;  pricing.andP;  The Master, configured as described above, will be priced at$55,000.andP;  The Octopus, with a Cipher tape drive for interfacing to colorsystems, TCP/IP Ethernet and Tops networks, a SCSI interface for the Iris andthe 4Cast, is an even $100,000.andP;  This price includes the OctoRIP software.andO;If you want Barco Calibrator monitors on any of the computers, just add$5,000 per monitor.andM;LinotypeandM;The Seybold Seminars marked the first showing of Linotype's Concert Seriesfont bundle, the announcement of a faster PostScript RIP, and a number ofenhancements to the Series 2000 composition system.andM;RIP III.andP;  A faster PostScript controller is always welcome news, and Linotypeplayed the announcement of its RIP III to the hilt.andP;  The machine uses afaster 68020 chip and new interpreter code, and is claimed to triple thespeed of processing certain halftone images.andP;  Average improvements over arange of jobs containing text and line art will be on the order of 30% fasterthan the RIP II.andP;  The RIP III will sell for the same price as the current RIPII, and will be packaged in the same way.andP;  That is, for the Linotronic 300and 500 imagesetters it will fit into the outboard tower cabinet, and it willbe inboard in the 200P.andM;RIP III, also known as the Saturn controller, was developed and built byLinotype itself, in contrast to the previous Redstone and Atlas controllersthat were Adobe board designs.andP;  It uses a 25-MHz 68020 central processor.andP;  Onthe L300 and L500 machines, it has 8 MB of RAM and a 135-MB disk as standardequipment, allowing much greater font bitmap caching.andP;  (It also allows muchgreater font storage, but right now all of Linotype's PostScript fonts wouldfit on a 20-MB disk.)andP;  The L200 model will have 4 MB of RAM and either a40-MB or 80-MB disk, depending on whether it is in the 1200-dpi A version orthe 1700-dpi B model.andM;The largest improvement in speed is due to various optimizations in thegraphics-handling code, particularly for screening halftones.andP;  However, thedifference in the speed of handling text and line art will be modest, sincethose routines were already highly optimized.andM;Upgrades.andP;  For current owners of L200P, L300 and L500 imagesetters, Linotypeis offering a generous upgrade option.andP;  The L300/500 controller can beupgraded for $9,950; this includes the new controller and a new 90-daywarranty.andP;  Users who have a Linotype service contract on their RIP II willget a $1,000 discount on the upgrade price.andM;Linotype also wants to protect users who bought a RIP just before the RIP IIIannouncement.andP;  If the 90-day warranty on the RIP II has not yet expired,Linotype will grant a $5,000 discount, bringing the upgrade price down to$4,950.andM;The policy for owners of the L200P is similar, but the prices areproportionately lower.andP;  The basic upgrade of the inboard controller is$5,950.andP;  The discount for service contract work is $1,000, while thein-warranty discount is $3,000.andM;PostSaturn.andP;  We wonder how long the Saturn design will last.andP;  Adobe is widelyrumored to be working on its own RISC-based successor to the 68020 RIPs.andO;(What will the successor be called? There are no rockets bigger than aSaturn.)andM;Concert Series.andP;  As PostScript service bureau operators and their customershave long known, the Macintosh is prone to especially severe font-numberingincompatibilities.andP;  For years, the Mac operating system supported only 128fonts.andP;  (The latest Mac software has overcome this problem and supports32,000 fonts, but much of the software on the market still relies on theoriginal font scheme.) To allow users to make the most of their limitedallotment of fonts, the Mac font installer program would renumber fonts if itdetected a conflict with an already-installed font.andP;  The upshot: no twosystems would assign font names and numbers the same way.andP;  Alas, mostapplications called fonts by number, not by name, which meant that a filecomposed on one system might not print with the correct fonts on anothersystem.andP;  Service bureau operators coped, to a degree, by instructingcustomers to bring along a copy of their system when typesetting a job.andM;Linotype has come up with a better solution, which it calls the ConcertSeries.andP;  The product is a disk or tape containing Linotype's entire libraryof PostScript fonts, plus three additional features.andM;* Reserved numbers.andP;  Linotype has claimed a specific subset of the 32,000font numbers allowed in the new system architecture for its own PostScriptfonts.andP;  Other font houses will do likewise, and Apple Computer has agreed toserve as a clearinghouse for reserved number ranges.andM;* Suitcase II and Font Harmony.andP;  These are low-cost Mac programs that supportlarge numbers of fonts and rationalize their numbering within each Macintoshto prevent conflict.andP;  The fonts that are delivered in the Concert Series havealready been harmonized.andM;* Baby Grande.andP;  Since rationalizing font numbers is no use unless all of aservice bureau's customers use the same numbering scheme, Baby Grande is acomplete set of Mac screen fonts corresponding to the PostScript printerfonts in Concert Series.andP;  The service bureau operator buying the printerfonts will be licensed to resell these screen fonts to his customers at arelatively low price.andP;  (They can't be free, since some of them--e.g., Bigelowandamp; Holmes' Lucida series--require royalties.)andP;  It is greatly to the operator'sinterest to do this; not only does he eliminate the numbering headache, buthe encourages use of a wide range of Linotype fonts.andP;  This will be animportant competitive advantage now that Compugraphic and Varityper areshipping PostScript typesetters.andM;Concert ticket.andP;  The Concert Series (including printer fonts, the Baby Grandepackage, and the Mac software) is priced at $8,600.andP;  That price assumes thatyou want the package on Apple tape cartridges and that you have sufficientdisk space to install the fonts in your Mac.andM;If you don't have a tape drive, Linotype will bundle one with Concert Seriesfor $9,600.andP;  If you prefer, Linotype will prepackage the information onto an80-MB SCSI disk, also for $9,600.andP;  For $10,500 you can get both tape anddisk.andM;Most service bureau operators already own a fair number of PostScript fonts.andO;They will receive full credit for their fonts toward the purchase of ConcertSeries.andM;Series 2000.andP;  There are a few small enhancements to Series 2000, but most ofthe product announcements were made at earlier shows.andP;  Three megabytes ofmemory is now the standard complement.andP;  TIFF and EPS formats, unsharpmasking, and mouse operation are now supported.andP;  The command to compose andpreview a file is now a single keystroke, and you can select which page tobegin previewing instead of having to start at the top of the document.andM;There have been some refinements in the translator routines for CRTronic andMCS files, and output queuing of PostScript files is now in place.andM;More significant, a fair number of Series 2000 systems have been installed bynow.andP;  For Linotype, that has meant that it must turn from designing newfeatures to accommodate the inevitable demands from the field formodifications to existing features.andM;While that doesn't generate much publishable news, it does strengthen theproduct.andM;OptronicsandM;Many announcements made at events such as the Seybold Seminars come as nosurprise to industry insiders.andP;  A case in point: Optronics's revelation thatits ColorSetter 2000 PostScript color imagesetter (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  3, p.andO;25 and the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  2, p. 42) usesa Custom Applications Inc. (CAI) interpreter, which, though never officiallyannounced, was widely assumed.andP;  Optronics (a division of Intergraph) saidthat it would announce other RIP options beginning around the end of April.andM;However, there the firm did release some news of immediate interest: it hassigned a multimillion-dollar OEM agreement to provide the ColorSetter 2000 toPre-Press Technologies.andP;   Pre-Press will use the ColorSetter as part of a newcolor separation product, the SpectreSetter, an adjunct to its Spectre seriesof color production systems.andM;No live performance.andP;  The operating requirements of a device such as theColorSetter 2000 don't match up well with the exhibit atmosphere at theSeminars.andP;  Since the imagesetter needs to be run in a darkroom and no suchfacility was available, Optronics could not show live output; the best itcould do was provide samples created earlier.andP;  Few shows offer the option ofa darkroom in one's booth, so we don't know when we will see the ColorSetter2000 actually producing color films.andM;Perhaps we can see it soon at a customer site: alpha units were shipped inMarch, and volume shipments were planned to begin in April and May.andM;In its present form, the ColorSetter 2000 system starts at about $110,000.andO;Depending on such options as memory and storage, it can reach roughly$160,000.andP;  Optronics claimed to have $10 million worth of back orders at thetime of the Seminars.andM;Modular design.andP;  Reliability and ease of maintenance are always in questionuntil a product has spent time in the field, but the ColorSetter 2000'smodular design looks to be a plus.andP;   Online diagnostics are provided; bydialing a remote number, the operator can have Optronics troubleshoot anydifficulties.andP;  The vendor claims that the laser component can be replacedwithin 10 minutes.andP;  Overheating should be an infrequent problem because theair used to cool the device is fully recirculated every three seconds.andM;Rumor has it that a cassette-based film-handling system is being developedfor the ColorSetter 2000, but Optronics officials would not confirm thisreport.andM;RIPSandM;RIPS showed several interesting developments at the Seybold Seminars: a new,faster controller, higher resolution on Canon laser printers, and the abilityto download Adobe fonts.andM;* Fonts.andP;  The most significant development for the entire PostScript marketwas a demonstration of downloading and printing encrypted Type One Adobefonts.andP;  Adobe has managed to keep its font format secret for several years inorder to protect its controller business, but that era has now ended.andP;  (Thetrouble with trade secrets is that they cannot be protected by patent orcopyright, since those legal rights require disclosure.andP;  Once a trade secretgets out, there is no protection.)andP;  The samples we saw, which were run on a400-dpi engine, looked quite good.andM;* Speed.andP;  RIPS has redesigned its controller board to use a faster processor.andO;The old design (which was no sluggard itself) used the Weitek 8100 chip set;the new board will use the Intel 80960KB chip.andP;  The 80960 is a family of RISCprocessors designed to be used, not as general-purpose microcomputers, but asdedicated embedded controllers.andP;  The KB version includes on-chipfloating-point math support.andP;  The first generation of 80960's is rated at 10Vax MIPS (that is, relative to a Vax 11/780, which runs at 1 MIPS).andP;  Thisshould make the new RIPS board 50% faster than its old design.andP;  Moreover,Intel has promised faster parts in the future.andM;At the same time, RIPS has moved the PostScript interpreter code into ROMs,which means that it will no longer be necessary to load code from your PC'sdisk each time you boot the computer.andP;  It also means that more of thecontroller RAM memory is available for fonts, page description files andpage-image bitmaps.andM;RIPS said that the new controller would be deliverable in May.andM;* Resolution.andP;  RIPS is now supporting the 400-dpi version of the Canon SXprinter, and is offering resolution-doubling for both 300- and 400-dpiengines.andP;  That is, it can drive a 300-dpi laser printer at either 300x300 dpior, by doubling the rate at which it switches the printer's laser diode, at600x300 dpi.andP;  A 400-dpi engine can be run at 400x400 dpi or 800x400 dpi.andP;  Theonly catch is that the controller needs more memory to form the page bitmapat the higher resolutions: three megabytes are provided on the basic 300x300board, but that must be increased to 4 MB for 600x300 or 400x400, and to 6 MBfor 800x400 operation.andM;We expect that 400-dpi printers will become much more common in the nearfuture, and that the falling prices of memory and processing power will maketheir controllers quite affordable.andP;  The improvement in quality isnoticeable.andM;Ultre hosts Hyphen, PandaandM;Hyphen RIP.andP;  Three exhibitors showed Hyphen's fast PostScript RIP at theSeminars: Chelgraph, High Sky and Ultre.andP;  Chelgraph runs the Hyphen softwarein its own bit-slice computer, as an alternative to its Ace-languageinterpreter.andP;  High Sky runs the Mac II version of the Hyphen software in itsMaster/Octopus product.andP;  We have covered these products separately in thisissue.andM;Ultre, which makes a film recording engine for the OEM trade, does not itselfsell a Hyphen-based product.andP;  But its UltreSetter is driven by the Hyphen RIPin Digital Technology's SpeedSetter product line as the output engine for 72-and 94-pica widths.andP;  (The 108-pica version of the SpeedSetter uses the ECRMPelBox recorder.)andP;  So it was quite happy to host Hyphen's presence.andM;Hyphen says that its Mac II version of the software, rasterizing at 600x1200dpi, can keep pace with the imaging speed of the Ultre if given a 35-secondhead start.andP;  (Well, it can keep up if the Mac is equipped with a fast 68030accelerator card.)andP;   Since most other PostScript RIPs on the market mustbuild a page file on disk before recording, or must periodically stop thefilm recorder, this is an impressive claim.andM;Purdy and Associates.andP;  Although the official U.S.andP;  launch of Purdy andAssociates' Panda product was scheduled to take place in April at the Type-Xshow, Peter Purdy came to the Seminars to give attendees a sneak preview ofhis system, Panda Designer.andP;  It is based on the Archetype display-adsoftware, but adds some special font management hardware as well as anediting program with an Archetypical user interface and network/filemanagement features.andM;The Panda font board plugs into any AT-class computer.andP;  On the board are a68000 processor, two megabytes of memory and a programmable-array chip.andP;  Theboard does two jobs: First, it scales fonts stored in the Purdy-MacintoshSpiral format, transforming the data into Ace run-length-coded format in theprocess.andP;  (Ace is the native language of the Chelgraph RIP.)andP;  The Ace formatis very efficient, and can be rendered on display screens, laser printers andtypesetters with good speed.andP;  Thus the font board establishes a common fontdatabase for all of the system's imaging devices.andM;Second, because each board has a serial number encoded into the PAL chip, itimplements copy protection for the fonts.andP;  Because Panda is able to guaranteethat fonts cannot be transferred from one font board to another, it hasnegotiated licensing agreements with Varityper, Monotype, ITC and Neufvillethat allow it to sell the fonts at very low prices.andP;  By &quot;very low,&quot; Pandameans $10-25 per font.andM;Purdy plans to sell a complete Designer system--an AT clone with 2MB memory,LaserView screen, mouse, a 72-pica Ultre film recorder, the font board with100 fonts, Ace RIP and Archetype Designer software--for $50,500.andP;  We'll havedetails on the optional networking capabiloities in our report from Type-X.andM;Panda also will throw its own GenEdit text editor (which follows theArchetype user interface conventions) into the bargain.andP;  Extra-cost optionswill include a 600x300-dpi laser printer, a scanner, and the wider 94-picaUltre recorder.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
