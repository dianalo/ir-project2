In designating the theme, Pope John Paul II pointed out that theVirgin Mary's ``earthly life was marked by a continual pilgrimagefrom one place to another'' _ from Nazareth to Bethlehem and then inflight to Egypt to save the child Jesus and later back again toNazareth.   ``She shines as a sign of certain hope and comfort to the pilgrimpeople of God,'' the pope said.

It found that religious bodies led the field in charitable workfor others, surpassing foundations and corporations.   Brian O`Connell, president of Independent Sector, a coalition of660 corporate, foundation and voluntary philanthrophic organizationswhich sponsored the study, said:   ``We realize more than we had expected how much the organizedneighborliness of religious organizations means to the kind ofcaring society we are.''   The study found that almost half of the $4l.4 billion contributedin 1986 to religion was used to support services to others, the restspent on internal activities such as worship and religious education.   Pollster George Gallup, whose organization gathered the data,said it showed churches are ``among our most cost-effectiveinstitutions'' in philanthropic work, with minimal administrativeoverhead.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Jan. 13.</NOTE></DOC>
