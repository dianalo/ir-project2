The current wave of protests, which began Monday, continued tospread as dissidents and radical students prepared to mark theprotests on May 18, 1980, in which 200 people died in the city ofKwangju, 165 miles south of Seoul.   On Tuesday, about 22,000 college students in Seoul and theprovincial cities of Kwangju, Taejon, Chongju, Pusan and Chonjutook part in anti-government and anti-U.S. protests, according tothe South Korean news agency Yonhap.   About 2,000 students fought with police on 17 campuses in Seoul.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Yankee go home!''the students shouted as they clashed with riot police. About 40,000U.S. troops are based in South Korea, whose government the UnitedStates has supported.   Armored police vans fired salvos of tear gas bombs into thecrowds, while martial arts squads charged the protesters. At leasttwo students were injured in the fighting and several policeofficers were hit by firebombs.   The nation's 130,000-member police force was on full alert, withsecurity squads deployed around government buildings and foreigndiploamtic missions in Seoul.   About 4,000 students also hurled rocks and firebombs at policein Kwangju. The protesters marched with a large sign showing abroken American flag.   ``Go home Yankees who supported the chief culprits in theKwangju massacre!'' the students chanted.   They also burned effigies of President Roh Tae-woo, who tookpower Feb. 25 after winning the elections in December. He haspromised to introduce democracy and has ended many of theauthoritarian polices of former President Chun Doo-hwan.   Many Koreans are distrustful of Roh, a former general, and theydemand a full accounting of the Kwangju revolt.   Radical students and dissidents hold him and other top leaderswho were military commanders at the time responsible forsuppressing the 1980 rebellion.   ``Punish culprit Roh Tae-woo!'' the students shouted.   Anti-government demonstrations marking the Kwangju anniversaryhave been routine, but this year's protests, riding on anopposition victory in last month's legislative elections, seem tobe more widespread.   Also contributing to the bold mood of the anniversary was theritual suicide of a dissident student at Seoul's MyongdongCathedral on Sunday.   Cho Sung-man, 24, a chemistry major at Seoul NationalUniversity, demanded the release of all political prisoners beforestabbing himself in the stomach and jumping from a building.   Dissident leaders said Cho, although not a native of Kwangju,will be buried there Thursday, near the victims of the 1980protests. They said they plan to make his burial site a``sanctuary'' for their democratic movement.</TEXT></DOC>
