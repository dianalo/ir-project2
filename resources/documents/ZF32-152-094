SullivanandM;Targeting the 1.6 million users of 286-based PS/2s in the United States,Intel Corp. this week is expected to announce a 386SX processor upgrade forIBM's Models 50 and 60.andM;In a separate announcement last week, Intel also beefed up its memory-boardline with a new Micro Channel architecture card and introduced its firstmemory add-on products for Hewlett-Packard Co.'s (HP's) LaserJet printers.andM;Intel's SnapIn 386, a module that plugs into the 286 motherboard socket,transforms PS/2 Model 50 and 60 PCs into 386SX-based machines, said officialsat the Hillsboro, Ore., firm.andP;  Priced at $495 and available immediatelythrough resellers, SnapIn 386 allows users to run 32-bit softwareapplications with a performance improvement of as much as 100 percent, theofficials explained.andM;The new module includes 16K bytes of cache memory and a DOS device driver.andP;  Adevice driver for OS/2 will be available by the end of August, officialssaid.andM;With its competitive price and strong name recognition, Intel is likely to besuccessful with the 386SX upgrade, said Mark Levitt, a PC analyst with marketresearcher International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.andP;  The large installedbase of Model 50 and 60 users are &quot;looking to leverage their initialinvestment and accommodate software such as Windows, which is growing inpopularity and works better on a 32-bit system,&quot; he said.andM;Intel's upgrade entry may force competitors such as Kingston Technology Corp.andO;and Sota Technology Inc., who offer 386SX coprocessor upgrades priced around$600, &quot;to lower their prices to remain competitive,&quot; Levitt added.andM;Intel is also taking a competitive stance in the add-in memory market with anew version of its AboveBoard.andM;The new version, called AboveBoard MC, replaces the firm's AboveBoard MC32, a32-bit Micro Channel memory card.andP;  The new card, which can be used with both16- and 32-bit Micro Channel PCs, uses 256K-, 1M- and 4M-byte single in-linememory modules to provide as much as 32M bytes of memory.andM;Available now, the AboveBoard MC is priced at $399 with no memory, $599 with1M byte of memory and $999 with 4M bytes of memory.andM;Intel's new add-on products for HP printers, called Matched Memory modules,come in 1M- and 2M-byte versions.andP;  Both boards are expandable to 4M bytesusing DRAM chips and are compatible with the LaserJet IIP, III, IIID and IIIPprinters.andM;Due in June, a 1M-byte version will cost $195, while a 2M-byte model willcost $295.andM;Intel was the first company to introduce a processor-upgrade board, with its1986 debut of the Inboard 386.andP;  The company can be reached at (800) 538-3373.andM;--------------------Additional reporting by KelleyandM;Damore</TEXT></DOC>
