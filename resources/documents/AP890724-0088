Net income fell 87 percent to $160 million, or 13 cents a share,from $1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the comparable 1988quarter, Exxon said.   Revenue for the oil giant rose 9 percent to $23.6 billion from$21.63 billion.   Exxon said the special second-quarter provision for expenses andlegal claims stemming from the March 24 spill in Alaska's PrinceWilliam Sound reduced earnings by $850 million, or 67 cents a share.   Exxon said the provision includes amounts already paid out aswell as estimated future outlays.   The nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from thetanker Exxon Valdez fouled hundreds of miles of water and coastline.   ``Clean-up of the Alaskan oil spill was Exxon's top priority inthe quarter,'' said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl. ``Themagnitude of the required effort is huge and therefore costly.''   But Rawl said Exxon's financial position remains strong.   For the first half of 1989, Exxon's provision for the Alaska oilspill totaled $880 million, including $30 million charged in thefirst quarter. Including the provision, Exxon's earnings totaled$1.4 billion, or $1.12 a share, for the first six months, down 46percent from $2.66 billion, or $1.96 a share, in the first half of1988.   Without the provision, Exxon's first half earnings were $2.3billion, or $1.81 a share, down 13 percent.   Revenue for the first half of 1989 rose to $45.86 billion from$43.63 billion a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
