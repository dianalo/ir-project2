The banks had been expected to provide the short-term loanto a new state agency, the Depositors Economic ProtectionCorp., created last month to take over and liquidate banksand credit unions still closed following the bank holidaydeclared Jan. 1 by Gov. Bruce Sundlun. His order froze $1.3billion of deposits in 45 institutions after the failure of aprivate deposit insurer. While many smaller institutions havereopened, the largest and most troubled remain closed,bleeding the state's already recession-ravaged economy.</LP><TEXT>   The apparent unraveling of the loan agreement is a setbackto the state's effort to return depositors' money. Aspokesman for the governor acknowledged the banks' concernsbut insisted that the bailout plan will go forward. &quot;It's nota question of whether we get there, but how, and all that isstill being worked out,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether we go with theloan or a quick asset sale, we should still be able toachieve the goal&quot; of paying off most depositors.   A bank executive said the planned loan, while &quot;notcompletely dead,&quot; is now unlikely. The bankers arequestioning the value of assets that would be used to backthe loan -- the portfolios of the closed institutions -- andsay that regulators have questioned the proposed transaction.The bankers also cite unspecified legal problems.   Instead, the banks are proposing a plan to directlyacquire the marketable assets of the closed banks, mostlyresidential mortgage portfolios. Proceeds from those saleswould go into the state agency and be used for the firstround of payouts to depositors. The banks aren't interestedin commercial loans held by the institutions, loans that arealmost entirely substandard, say federal regulators.   While asset purchases by the banks would cover the firstround of payouts, it leaves in doubt the fate of customerswith larger deposits who were to have been paid back over thenext four years.   Also in doubt is a plan for a Providence savings bank toacquire four of the closed institutions. Federal regulatorshave insisted that the state guarantee the bad assets beforeallowing the sale.   Separately, Michael A. Lolicata, 39 year old, of Lincoln,R.I., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Providence tosecurities fraud in a business failure that played a role inthe wrenching collapse of much of the state's banking system.Sentencing was set for May 29.   Under the plea agreement, the government recommended thatMr. Lolicata be sentenced to serve 30 to 37 months in prison.He could also be fined twice the $13 million he allegedlyswindled from 280 people who invested in twoequipment-leasing companies from 1985 until 1989, when thefirms filed for bankruptcy court protection. Prosecutorsalleged he never bought the equipment to secure investors'high-interest notes and that the securities weren't properlyregistered. State-chartered Jefferson Loan andamp; Investment Bankinvested nearly a third of its assets in the notes, and whenthe firms folded, Jefferson followed.   Jefferson was one of two small banks whose failuresdrained the Rhode Island Share andamp; Deposit Indemnity Corp., theprivate insurer.</TEXT></DOC>
