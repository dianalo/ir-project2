It is a story related by Professor William O. Dunkelberg, who isalso dean of Temple University's School of Business and Management,in an effort to make clear that taxes and mandated benefits carrysimilar burdens.   The term ``mandated benefits'' is one of those euphemisms used toavoid the stigma of the terrible ``T'' word, and that suggests itcould get a workout during an administration pledged to no taxincreases.   The partners scrape together $20,000 and enough other financingto get into operation. They employ 20 people the first year andmanage to take home $15,000 each, enough to stay in business ratherthan working for someone else.   Since there are a large number of pizza places, it soon becomesclear they cannot make much more than $15,000 each because of thecompetition. So, each year they settle for $15,000 each.   Then, suddenly, they are required to provide health insurance forthe 20 workers, most of whom are young and already covered by familyinsurance. This costs $500 a year for each employee, or a total of$10,000 a year.   At the end of the year, therefore, the two partners have earnedonly $10,000 each to support their families. Something must be done;a conference is held.   They consider closing shop and working for someone else, but thatwould mean firing 20 employees. They could be content with $10,000each, though they could make $15,000 elsewhere. They could cutwages. They could raise prices.   They decide to raise prices. So do their competitors, who arefaced with the same situation. However, it becomes clear that athigher prices people buy less pizza. They are forced to fire anemployee. Their competitors do likewise.   As a result, at the end of the year they are nearly able torestore their $15,000 salaries. In effect, their customers and theemployees who lost their jobs paid for the mandated benefits.Somebody had to.   Ultimately, it might have worked out differently. As analternative, the market might have reduced the cash pay of all pizzaworkers so that the cash, plus the new health benefits, would haveequaled the old wages.   If that were the eventuality, those receiving the benefits wouldhave paid directly. But they might have rebelled, especially sincemost did not want the coverage. Even worse, those that did, mighthave gotten them cheaper elsewhere.   Now, says Dunkelberg, substitute ``profit tax'' or ``minimumwage'' or ``mandatory child care'' or any other mandated governmentprogram. You would get the same results as were obtained from themandated medical insurance.   Now, the professor suggests, consider this: Many people receiveso-called benefits they do not want. Many who receive benefits arenot members of the target groups that government is trying to help.   In such ways, says Dunkelberg, we lay waste our tax money. Andthe waste is worsened by the medium of distribution, which is thesmall company. Small companies, he observes, are not efficientadministrators of social programs.   What small companies do well _ and 90 percent of all U.S.employers have 20 or fewer employees _ is produce goods andservices. When we divert them from what they do well, saysDunkelberg, the entire economy suffers.   He says these programs can mean higher prices for poor and richalike, maybe lower wages, inefficient distribution of services,layoffs, and perhaps fewer businesses.   Many people will be forced to pay for and receive services theydo not want. Even worse, most of the benefits will be received byconsumers who do not belong to the target groups that Congressdesires to help.   Mandated benefits? ``It's a terrible idea, and it is time werecognized it as such,'' Dunkelberg said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Fri, Dec. 2</NOTE></DOC>
