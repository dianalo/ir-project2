L. 98-620, 42 U.S.C. 10701 <T3>et seq., </T3>as amended, the Institute is authorized to award grants,cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts, nonprofitorganizations, and others for the purpose of improving the administrationof justice in the State courts of the United States. Approximately $10million will be available for award in FY 1989. The guideline published for comment below establishes the Institute's fundingschedule, procedures, and priorities for FY 1989. As in previous years,the guideline sets forth ``special interest'' categories of Institute funding.A number of administrative changes are also proposed and summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="84">FY 1989 Funding Schedule </ITAG>The FY 1989 concept paper deadline is February 2, 1989. In a departurefrom previous practice, papers must be postmarked, rather than receivedby SJI, by that date. The Board of Directors will meet in late March toinvite formal applications based on the most promising concept papers.Applications will be due in late May, and awards approved by the Boardin July. This will be the only round of funding in FY 1989; the FY 1990funding cycle is expected to begin with the submission of concept papersin November, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Interest Categories </ITAG>A number of the FY 1988 special interest categories have been retainedwithout change for FY 1989. Several others have been amended, and six newcategories have been added. See section II.B for the complete list of specialinterest categories.The amended special interest categories are: Judicial career enhancement;judicial education; alternative dispute resolution; the future and thecourts; litigation expense and delay; enforcement of fines and orders topay; victim/witness procedures; courthouse security; State/Federal relations;and the special needs of the largest urban courts. (A description of theproposed changes in the judicial education category is set forth below.)The six new special interest categories are: The impact of user fees; improvedenforcement and management of probation; review and enforcement of continuingcourt orders; substance abuse; the court-related needs of elderly and disabledpersons; and public education about the courts. In addition, the general description of ``special interest'' projects hasbeen modified to clarify the meaning of the terms ``replicability'' and``transferability.'' <T3>Judicial education. </T3>The proposed changes in the ``judicial education''special interest category are specifically noted for public comment. In May, 1988, the Board of Directors selected a panel of six individualsto examine judicial education from different perspectives in order to givethe Board a clearer direction about how the Institute should use its fundsin the area. The panelists were: Thomas Hodson, an attorney in privatepractice and former judge who facilitated the panel's work; Justice ChristineDurham of the Utah Supreme Court; Dennis Catlin, Executive Director ofthe Michigan Judicial Institute; David Schultz, Associate Dean and Professorof Law at the University of Wisconsin Law School; Professor Charles Claxtonof the Memphis State University College of Education; and Professor FrederickLawrence of the Boston College Department of Theology and School of Law.The panelists have prepared independent, preliminary draft papers thatwere circulated to State and national judicial education providers forcomment. In early October, 1988, representatives of those organizationswere invited to comment on the papers at a public forum before the Board.Based on the panel's observations, the educators' response to their papers,and the discussions of the Board, the Institute invites comment on a numberof issues. First, comment is specifically invited on the following types of possibleSJI funding in the judicial education area in FY 1989: (1) <T3>Technical assistance. </T3>The Board will consider awarding a contractfor the provision of technical assistance to State judicial educators andnational judicial education organizations for the purpose of State-to-State,State-to-national, and national-to-State transfer of educational curricula,delivery techniques, services and resource materials. The project couldalso assist State judicial educators and other State court officials inthe preparation of grant applications. (2) <T3>Money for States lackinq well developed judicial education programs.</T3>Due to the disparity which exists in State judicial education programs,the Board is considering whether the Institute should provide seed moneyto assist interested States in developing minimum standards for judicialeducation and training; creating an on-going entity responsible for planningand implementing judicial education programs; and developing basic in-Statejudicial education programs for judges and other court personnel. (3) <T3>Formula grants to each State for judicial education. </T3>The Instituterequests comment on whether it should award formula grants to States forcertain educational purposes, e.g., developing and improving in-State judicialeducation programs, or supporting ``scholarships'' for judges and othercourt personnel to attend out-of-State training? Commenters should identifythe bases on which such funds might be distributed among the States, e.g.,population, number of judges, size of the States' judicial education budgets,as well as the criteria States might be required to meet to receive suchfunding, e.g., the demonstration of the State's commitment to providingjudicial education. The second broad issue on which SJI seeks comment is the specific criteriaon which education and training proposals should be evaluated. The Instituteis considering evaluating the following elements in order to determinewhether a project is likely to result in effective training for judgesand other court personnel: The description of how the need for the programhas been determined; the methods by which faculty will be recruited, selected,and trained; the objectives of the training; the adult education practicesand teaching methods to be employed; and the methods by which the programwill be evaluated to determine the impact of the training as well as thereaction of the participants. Third, SJI asks for comment on whether it should give priority to certaintypes of judicial education projects. Which, if any, of the following typesof education and training should be given priority by SJI: Training programsdeveloped for an individual when he or she first becomes a judge; continuingjudicial education projects which inform judges of new developments inthe law or enhance judicial skills; or personal development projects whichfocus on human enrichment?Finally, the Board is interested in continuing to develop a long-rangestrategic plan for SJI support of judicial education programs at the Stateand national level. Specific comment on issues and ideas that the planshould address is also invited. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Changes </ITAG>The proposed FY 1989 SJI grant procedures will be substantially similarto the FY 1988 program. The Board considered changing the two-tiered (conceptpaper/application) funding process in order to reduce the burdens the processmay impose on applicants, particularly those applicants who are invitedto apply formal applications that are disapproved by the Board. However,after reviewing the Institute's FY 1988 experience, when approximately85% of the formal applications were approved (in contrast to FY 1987, whenonly about half of the applications were approved), the Board concludedthat the present procedures were not unduly burdensome. Comment is specificallyinvited, however, on possible changes in the application process, includingways to relieve organizations submitting multiple concept papers or applicationsfrom the burden of submitting repetitive information in each paper or application.Some changes in the funding process have been made on the basis of theexperience of the Institute, applicants, and grantees, and several technicalamendments to the SJI enabling legislation that were recently passed byCongress. The most significant of these changes are: <T3>Renewal funding. </T3>The guideline establishes two types of renewalfunding: Continuation grants and on-going support grants. A ``continuation''grant is one that extends an existing project for an additional periodof time in order to enhance its benefits; an ``on-going support'' grantwould support a program or service for which there is a continuing, importantnational need. With respect to continuation grants, the guideline seeks to clarify andreduce the information that applicants for continuation funding must provideabout their projects and organizations. In addition, applicants for continuationgrants would be permitted to apply for funding outside of the normal fundingcycle for FY 1989 awards. See section IX. A. ``On-going support'' grants would be reserved for SJI-supported projectsthat the Board determines are especially unique and valuable to the Statecourts. Funding for the second and third years of such projects would becontingent on satisfactory performance and the availability of appropriations.An evaluation report regarding the effectiveness and operation of the projectwill be required during the final year of an ``on-going support'' project.See section IX.B. <T3>Match. </T3>Pursuant to a statutory amendment, all units of State orlocal government (not just courts) must provide a match equal to 50% ofthe amount of funding requested from SJI. See section X.B. <T3>Interim funding. </T3>The previous statutory requirement that fundingto an applicant seeking continuation funding be continued until such timeas a formal hearing has been held terminating its funds has been eliminatedby an amendment to the SJI statute. <T3>Confidentiality of information/human subjects protection. </T3>Theconfidentiality provision in the FY 1988 guideline has been incorporatedinto the Institute's enabling legislation, and a new clause protectinghuman research subjects has been added to the guideline. See section VII.C.<T3>Budget information. </T3>Applicants will be asked to provide more informationin support of some budget items. See section VII.D. The Institute also invites comment on the following specific issue: Should``maintenance'' funding be provided to certain <T3>organizations </T3>that provide important services to the State courts,without requiring those organizations to submit proposals seeking fundsfor specific projects? Commenters should also indicate which organizationsthey believe should receive such funding, and the criteria on which suchfunds should be awarded. <ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendations to Grantwriters </ITAG>Over the past two years, Institute staff have reviewed approximately 550concept papers and 200 applications. On the basis of those reviews, inquiriesfrom applicants, and the views of the Board, the Institute offers the followingrecommendations to help potential applicants present workable, understandableproposals that can meet the funding criteria set forth in this guideline.The Institute suggests that applicants make certain that they answer thefollowing questions when preparing a concept paper or application: 1. <T3>What is the subject or problem you wish to address? </T3>Describe the subject or problem and how it affects the courts and the public.Discuss how your approach will improve the situation or advance the stateof the art or knowledge, and explain why it is the most appropriate approachto take. When statistics or research findings are cited to support a statementor position, the source of the citation should be referenced in a footnote.2. <T3>What do you want to do? </T3>Explain the goal(s) of the project in simple, straightforward terms. Tothe greatest extent possible, an applicant should avoid a specialized vocabularythat is not readily understood by the general public. Technical jargondoes not enhance a paper.3. <T3>How will you do it?</T3>All proposed tasks should be set forth so that a reviewer can see a logicalprogression of tasks and relate those tasks directly to the accomplishmentof the project's goal(s). When in doubt about whether to provide a moredetailed explanation or to assume a particular level of knowledge or expertiseon the part of the reviewers, err on the side of caution and provide theadditional information. A description of project tasks will also help identifynecessary budget items. All staff positions and project costs should relatedirectly to the tasks described. The Institute encourages concept paperapplicants to attach letters of cooperation and support from the courtsand related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by theproposed project. 4. <T3>How will you know it works? </T3>Every project design must include an evaluation component to determinewhether the proposed training, procedure, service, or technology accomplishedthe objectives it was designed to meet. Concept papers and applicationsshould describe the criteria that will be used to evaluate the project'seffectiveness and identify program elements which will require furthermodification. The description in the application should include how theevaluation will be conducted, when it will occur during the project period,who will conduct it, and what specific measures will be used. In most instances,the evaluation should be conducted by persons not connected with the implementationof the procedure, training, service, or technique, or the administrationof the project. 5. <T3>How will others find out about it?</T3> Every project design must include a plan to disseminate the results ofthe training, research, or demonstration beyond the jurisdictions and individualsdirectly affected by the project. The plan should identify the specificmethods which will be used to inform the field about the project, suchas the publication of law review or journal articles, presentations atappropriate conferences, or the distribution of key materials. A statementthat a report or research findings ``will be made available to'' the fieldis not sufficient. The specific means of distribution or disseminationshould be identified. Reproduction and dissemination costs are allowablebudget items. 6. What are the specific costs involved? The budget in both concept papers and applications should be clearly presented.Major budget categories such as personnel, benefits, travel, supplies,equipment, and indirect costs should be clearly identified. In applications,the budgeted figures should relate directly to the specific project tasksincluded in the workplan. If match is offered, the nature of the match(cash or in-kind) should be explained and, at the application stage, thetasks and line items for which the costs will be covered wholly or in partby the match should be specified. 7. <T3>What, if any, match is being offered?</T3>All units of State and local government, including courts, are requiredby the State Justice Institute Act, as amended, to contribute a match (cash,non-cash, or both) of not less than 50 percent of the grant funds requestedfrom the Institute; all other applicants are also encouraged to providea matching contribution to assist in meeting the costs of a project. Thematch requirement works as follows in practice: If the total cost of aproject is anticipated to be $150,000, a State court or executive branchagency may request up to $100,000 from the Institute to implement the project.The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000 requested from SJI) must beprovided as match. Cash match includes funds directly contributed to the project by the applicant,or by other public or private sources. Non-cash match refers to in-kindcontributions by the applicant, or other public private sources. When matchis offered, the nature of the match (cash or in-kind) should be explainedand, at the application stage, the tasks and line items for which costswill be covered wholly or in part by match should be specified.<ITAG tagnum="85">Contact Persons for State Agencies Administering Institute Grantsto State and Local Courts </ITAG>The Institute would appreciate receiving updated information regardingthe name, title, address, and telephone number of the person designatedby the State Supreme Court to be responsible for overseeing the administrationof Institute grants awarded to the courts of the State. A list of the personscurrently so designated is appended to the guideline. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed State Justice Institute Grant Guideline </ITAG>The following FY 1989 Grant Guideline is proposed for public comment:<ITAG tagnum="74">State Justice Institute Grant Guideline Table of Contents </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Summary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I.

The Institute, a private nonprofit corporationestablished by an Act of Congress, is authorized to award grants, cooperativeagreements and contracts to State and local courts and their agencies;national nonprofit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunctionwith, and serving the judicial branch of State governments; and nationalnonprofit organizations for the education and training of judges and supportpersonnel of the judicial branch of State governments. The Institute may also award funds to other nonprofit organizations withexpertise in judicial administration; institutions of higher education;individuals, partnerships, firms, or corporations; and private agencieswith expertise in judicial administration if the objectives of the fundedprogram can be better served by such an entity. Funds may also be awardedto Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courtsfor services that cannot be provided for adequately through nongovernmentalarrangements. Approximately $10 million is available for grants, contracts, and cooperativeagreements from FY 1989, appropriations. The Institute may also providefinancial assistance in the form of interagency agreements with other grantors.The Institute will consider applications for funding support that addressany of the areas specified in its enabling legislation; however, the Boardof Directors of the Institute has designated certain program categoriesas being of special interest. The Institute has established one round of competition for FY 1989 funds,with a concept paper submission deadline of February 2, 1989. This guidelineapplies to concept papers and formal applications submitted for FY 1989funding. The awards made by the State Justice Institute are governed by the requirementsof this guideline and the authority conferred by Pub. L. 98-620, TitleII, 42 U.S.C. 10701, <T3>et seq. </T3><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>The State Justice Institute (``Institute'') was established by Pub. L.98-620 to improve the administration of justice in the State courts inthe United States. Incorporated in the State of Virginia as a private,nonprofit corporation, the Institute is charged, by statute, with the responsibilityto: A. Direct a national program of financial assistance designed to assurethat each citizen of the United States is provided ready access to a fairand effective system of justice; B. Foster coordination and cooperation with the Federal judiciary; C. Promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers doctrineto an independent judiciary; and D. Encourage education for judges and support personnel of State courtsystems through national and State organizations, including universities.To accomplish these broad objectives, the Institute is authorized to providefunds to State courts, national organizations which support and are supportedby State courts, national judicial education organizations, and other organizationsthat can assist in improving the quality of justice in the State courts.The Institute is supervised by an eleven-member Board of Directors appointedby the President, by and with the consent of the Senate. The Board is statutorilycomposed of six judges, a state court administrator and four members ofthe public, no more than two of whom can be of the same political party.The Institute's program budget for Fiscal Year 1989 is approximately $10million. Through the award of grants, contracts and cooperative agreements,the Institute is authorized to perform the following activities: 1. Support research, demonstrations, special projects, technical assistance,and training to improve the administration of justice in the State courts;2. Provide for the preparation, publication, and dissemination of informationregarding State judicial systems; 3. Participate in joint projects with Federal agencies and other privategrantors; 4. Evaluate or provide for the evaluation of programs and projects fundedby the Institute to determine their impact upon the quality of criminal,civil, and juvenile justice and the extent to which they have contributedto improving the quality of justice in the State courts; 5. Encourage and assist in furthering judicial education; 6. Encourage, assist, and serve in a consulting capacity to State and localjustice system agencies in the development, maintenance, and coordinationof criminal, civil, and juvenile justice programs and services; and 7. Be responsible for the certification of national programs that are intendedto aid and improve State judicial systems.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Scope of the Program </ITAG>During FY 1989, the Institute will consider applications for funding supportthat address any of the areas specified in its enabling legislation. TheBoard, however, has designated certain program categories as being of ``specialinterest.'' See section II.B. A. Authorized Program Areas The State Justice Institute Act authorizes the Institute to fund projectsaddressing one or more of the following program areas: 1. Assistance to State and local court systems in establishing appropriateprocedures for the selection and removal of judges and other court personneland in determining appropriate levels of compensation; 2. Education and training programs for judges and other court personnelfor the performance of their general duties and for specialized functions,and national and regional conferences and seminars for the disseminationof information on new developments and innovative techniques; 3. Research on alternative means for using judicial and nonjudicial personnelin court decisionmaking activities, implementation of demonstration programsto test such innovative approaches, and evaluations of their effectiveness;4. Studies of the appropriateness and efficacy of court organizations andfinancing structures in particular States, and support to States to implementplans for improved court organization and financing; 5. Support for State court planning and budgeting staffs and the provisionof technical assistance in resource allocation and service forecastingtechniques; 6. Studies of the adequacy of court management systems in State and localcourts, and implementation and evaluation of innovative responses to recordsmanagement, data processing, court personnel management, reporting andtranscription of court proceedings, and juror utilization and management;7. Collection and compilation of statistical data and other informationon the work of the courts and on the work of other agencies which relateto and affect the work of courts; 8. Studies of the causes of trial and appellate court delay in resolvingcases, and establishing and evaluating experimental programs for reducingcase processing time; 9. Development and testing of methods for measuring the performance ofjudges and courts and experiments in the use of such measures to improvethe functioning of judges and the courts; 10. Studies of court rules and procedures, discovery devices, and evidentiarystandards to identify problems with the operation of such rules, procedures,devices, and standards; and the development of alternative approaches tobetter reconcile the requirements of due process with the need for swiftand certain justice, and testing of the utility of those alternative approaches;11. Studies of the outcomes of cases in selected areas to identify instancesin which the substance of justice meted out by the courts diverges frompublic expectations of fairness, consistency, or equity; and the development,testing and evaluation of alternative approaches to resolving cases insuch problem areas; 12. Support for programs to increase court responsiveness to the needsof citizens through citizen education, improvement of court treatment ofwitnesses, victims, and jurors, and development of procedures for obtainingand using measures of public satisfaction with court processes to improvecourt performance; 13. Testing and evaluating experimental approaches to provide increasedcitizen access to justice, including processes which reduce the cost oflitigating common grievances and alternative techniques and mechanismsfor resolving disputes between citizens; and 14. Other programs, consistent with the purposes of the Act, as may bedeemed appropriate by the Institute, including projects dealing with therelationship between Federal and State court systems in areas where thereis concurrent State-Federal jurisdiction and where Federal courts, directlyor indirectly, review State court proceedings. Funds will not be made available for the ordinary, routine operation ofcourt systems in any of these areas. B. Special Interest Program Categories <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Description </ITAG>The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programsof proven merit that can be replicated in other jurisdictions. Althoughapplications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for fundingin FY 1989, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projectsthat: a. Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existingarrangements to improve the courts; b. Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special needof serious attention; c. Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicabilityin that they develop products, services and techniques that may be usedin other States; d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the informationand ideas developed to relevant audiences in State and local judicial systemsor provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effectiveprograms and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions.A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meetsthe four criteria set forth above and (1) it falls within the scope ofthe ``special interest'' program areas designated below or (2) informationcoming to the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliatedorganizations, the research literature, or other sources demonstrates thatthe project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts.Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' categorywill be accorded a preference in the rating process. (See the selectioncriteria listed in sections VI. B, ``Concept Paper Submission Requirementsfor New Projects'' and VIII. B, ``Application Review Procedures.'') <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific Categories </ITAG>The Board has designated the areas set forth below as ``Special Interest''program categories. The order of listing does not imply any ordering ofpriorities among the categories. a. <T3>Judicial and court personnel career enhancement. </T3>This categoryincludes the development and testing of innovative measures to encourageand enhance judicial and court personnel careers, other than direct increasesin salary. These methods could include approaches that emphasize the intrinsicrewards of the profession such as job enrichment and participative managementstrategies, use of ``quality circles'', judicial and nonjudicial personnelexchange programs, innovative programs or techniques for reducing judicialstress or ``burnout'', judicial sabbatical programs, or mentoring programs.This category also includes efforts to prepare lawyers for judicial careersand to encourage qualified persons to seek and accept positions as judgesand court professionals. b. <T3>Education and training for judges and other key court personnel. </T3>Thiscategory includes: i. The development of minimum standards for judicial education at the Statelevel; ii. The preparation of State plans to ensure a comprehensive training programand the effective allocation of limited court education resources; iii. For those States with a limited court education capacity, the developmentof an organization to plan and implement education programs for judgesand court personnel; iv. The establishment of in-State pre-bench orientation programs and newjudge training programs; and v. The development of innovative continuing education and career developmentprograms for all court personnel, including but not limited to programsthat emphasize ``team'' training. Court education programs should assure that faculty understand and applyadult education techniques and teaching methods; provide opportunitiesfor structured interaction among participants; develop tangible productsand materials for use by the faculty and participants; employ a processfor the recruitment of qualified and effective faculty; and develop soundmethods for evaluating the impact of the training. Court education programs also should develop new or revised curricula onkey topics of concern to the judiciary, such as those identified in theSJI Special Interest categories and other topics that judges and courtpersonnel have identified as important. The Board also is interested in awarding a contract for the provision oftechnical assistance to State judicial educators and national judicialeducation organizations for the purpose of State-to-State, State-to-national,and national-to-State transfer of educational curricula, delivery techniques,services and resources. This project could also assist State judicial educatorsand other State court officials in preparation of grant applications. c. <T3>Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). </T3>This category includes theevaluation of new and existing dispute resolution procedures and programsthat have a substantial likelihood of resolving civil, criminal, domesticrelations, juvenile and other types of disputes more fairly, more expeditiouslyand less expensively than the traditional court process, with particularemphasis on the impact of those procedures and programs on the qualityof justice provided, litigant and court costs, and court workload. Amongthe possible issues that may be addressed are the effects that ADR programsthat focus on domestic relations cases have on case processing; the effectivenessof ADR techniques in complex civil litigation; and the judicial role insettling cases, including the effectiveness of various settlement techniques,the most appropriate point(s) in the litigation process to convene a settlementconference, and the ethical questions that may confront a judge seekingto settle a case. d. <T3>The future and the courts. </T3>This category includes research onthe changing demands and circumstances that will face the courts in the21st century, and the planning and implementation of modifications thatmay be needed in court organization, financing, procedures, services, personnel,and facilities to respond to those demands and circumstances. A proposedproject could focus on such issues as:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The impact that demographic changes in the American population overthe next generation will have on the State courts; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_How developments in chemistry, disease and disease control, engineering,computer design, and other sciences are likely to affect the courts; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The possible changes in court structure, court administration, orlegal authority that might help the State courts more effectively administerjustice. </ITAG>e. <T3>The impact of user fees on court revenues and the access to justice.</T3>This category includes research examining the various forms of userfees that are imposed on parties in civil, criminal, domestic relations,juvenile and other types of cases in order to assess their impact on courtuse, policies, services, revenues, and costs. f. <T3>Application of technology. </T3>This category includes the testingof innovative applications of technology to improve the operation of courtmanagement systems and judicial practices at both the trial and appellatecourt levels, including, e.g., the publication of a court technology bulletinto assist judges and court managers in selecting technology appropriateto a court's needs; assessment of the usefulness of on-bench computer terminals;and local experiments with promising but untested applications of technologyin the courts. (See paragraph XI.H.2.b. regarding the limits on the useof grant funds to purchase equipment and software.)g. <T3>Jury system management. </T3>This category includes the development,implementation and evaluation of legal and administrative procedures relatingto jurors to ensure the representativeness of the juror pool, clarify juryinstructions, expedite the jury selection and empanelment process withoutaffecting fairness, and otherwise reduce the cost and enhance the fairnessof the jury process. h. <T3>Reduction of litigation expense and delay. </T3>This category includesthe implementation and evaluation of innovative programs and proceduresdesigned to reduce substantially the expense and delay in civil, criminal,domestic relations, juvenile, or other types of litigation at the trialor appellate level (or both), and the examination of effective methodsof limiting the expense and delay arising from the use of discovery procedures.i. <T3>Enforcement of fines and orders to pay. </T3>This category includesthe implementation and evaluation of procedures for effectively imposing,collecting, and enforcing orders to pay fines, restitution, and other obligations.j. <T3>Improved enforcement and management of probation. </T3>This categoryincludes the implementation and evaluation of innovative procedures forenforcing compliance with conditions of probation, and methods throughwhich courts responsible for managing the probation function can carryout this responsibility more effectively and efficiently. k. <T3>Review and enforcement of continuing court orders. </T3>This categoryincludes the development, implementation and evaluation of effective andefficient procedures for monitoring and enforcing on-going court orderssuch as those issued in civil commitment, guardianship, neglect and abuse,child support, and institutional reform cases. Examples of these proceduresinclude but are not limited to periodic review hearings; the required submissionand review of periodic reports and financial accountings; the use of citizenreview panels; and the appointment of special masters. Proposed projectsshould seek to provide fair, current, and thorough review of continuingcourt orders within realistic financial constraints and without overburdeningthe agencies, organizations, or individuals responsible for implementingthe continuing order. l. <T3>Substance abuse. </T3>The Board is interested in sponsoring (or co-sponsoring)conferences, seminars, or other forums for judges, probation officers,caseworkers and other court personnel to examine court-related issues concerningdrug and alcohol abuse and to discuss the appropriate role of the courtsin addressing the problem of substance abuse. m. <T3>Implications of AIDS for the courts. </T3>This category includes researchregarding the implications of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome for courtdecisions, procedures, and policies, including but not limited to suchmatters as pretrial release, sentencing, child custody, termination ofparental rights, and the right to and termination of medical treatment.n. <T3>Programs and procedures for victims and witnesses. </T3>This categoryincludes the implementation and evaluation of innovative court-based programsand procedures for providing fair treatment for victims of crimes and witnesses.``Court-based'' programs include those programs that are administered directlyby the courts or through contracts negotiated between service providersand the courts.

Eligibility for Award </ITAG>In awarding funds to accomplish these objectives and purposes, the Institutehas been directed by Congress to give priority to State and local courtsand their agencies (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(A)); national nonprofit organizationscontrolled by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicialbranches of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(B)); and nationalnonprofit organizations for the education and training of judges and supportpersonnel of the judicial branch of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(C)).An applicant will be considered a ``priority'' education and training applicantunder section 10705(b)(1)(C) if: (1) The principal purpose or activityof the applicant is to provide education and training to State and localjudges and court personnel; and (2) the applicant demonstrates a recordof substantial experience in the field of judicial education and training.The Institute also is authorized to make awards to other nonprofit organizationswith expertise in judicial administration, institutions of higher education,individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, and private agencies withexpertise in judicial administration, provided that the objectives of therelevant program area(s) can be served better. In making this judgment,the Institute will consider the likely replicability of the projects' methodologyand results in other jurisdictions. For-profit organizations are also eligiblefor grants and cooperative agreements; however, they must waive their fees.Finally, the Institute is authorized to make awards to Federal, State orlocal agencies and institutions other than courts for services that cannotbe adequately provided through nongovernmental arrangements. Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved,consistent with State law, by the State's Supreme Court or its designatedagency or council. The latter shall receive all Institute funds awardedto such courts and be responsible for assuring proper administration ofInstitute funds, in accordance with section XI.B.2 of this guideline. Alist of persons to contact in each State regarding approval of applicationsfrom State and local courts and administration of Institute grants to thosecourts is contained in the Appendix. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Types of Projects and Amounts of Awards </ITAG>A. Types of Projects Except as expressly provided in sections II.B.2.s. and II.C.1. above, theInstitute has placed no limitation on the overall number of awards or thenumber of awards in each special interest category.

Concept papers and applications for new projects and applications forcontinuation grants may request funding in amounts up to $300,000; a projectaddressing the needs of the largest urban courts under Special Interestcategory s. may, however, receive support of up to $500,000. For othernew and continuation projects, awards in excess of $200,000 are likelyto be rare and to be made, if at all, only for highly promising proposalsthat will have a significant impact nationally. 2. Applications for on-going support grants may request funding in amountsup to $600,000. The funds to support the first year of the project willbe drawn from the Institute's appropriations for the Fiscal Year of theaward. Funds to support each subsequent year will be made available subjectto the availability of appropriations for that Fiscal Year, the satisfactoryperformance of the project as reflected in the quarterly Progress Reportsrequired to be filed and routine grant monitoring, and the submission forInstitute approval of a detailed annual task schedule within 30 days ofthe end of each project year. C. Length of Grant Periods 1. Grant periods for all new and continuation projects ordinarily willnot exceed 24 months. 2. Grant periods for on-going support grants ordinarily will not exceed36 months.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects </ITAG>Concept papers are an extremely important part of the application processbecause they enable the Institute to learn the program areas of primaryinterest to the courts and to explore innovative ideas, without imposingheavy burdens on prospective applicants. The use of concept papers alsopermits the Institute to better project the nature and amount of grantawards. Because of their importance, the Institute requires all partiesrequesting financial assistance from the Institute (except those seekingrenewal funding pursuant to section IX.) to submit concept papers priorto submitting a formal grant application. This requirement may be waivedby the Board only if it determines that extraordinary circumstances existto justify the waiver. A. Format and Content Concept papers must include a cover sheet and a narrative. 1. The cover sheet must contain: a. A title describing the proposed project; b. The name and address of the court, organization or individual submittingthe paper; and c. The name, title, address (if different from that in b.), and telephonenumber of a contact person who can provide further information about thepaper. 2. The narrative must be no more than 10 doublespaced pages on 8\1/2\ by11 inch paper. Margins should not be less than 1 inch. The narrative shouldcontain: a. A statement listing the statutory program area(s), and ``special interest''category(ies), if any, addressed by the paper; b. An explanation of the need for the project; c.

A description of the products that will result, the degree to whichthey will be applicable to courts across the nation, and the manner inwhich the products and results of the project will be disseminated; f. An explanation of the expected benefits to be derived from the project;g. The identity of the key staff (if known) and a summary description oftheir qualifications; h. A preliminary budget estimate including the anticipated costs for personnel,fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, contracts, indirect costs,and other anticipated major expenditure categories; i. The amount, nature (cash or non-cash), and source of match to be provided(see section X.B.); and j. A statement of whether financial assistance for the project has beenor will be sought from other sources. The Institute encourages concept paper applicants to attach letters ofcooperation and support from the courts and related agencies that willbe involved in or directly affected by the proposed project. The Institute will not accept concept papers exceeding 10 pages. The pagelimit does not include letters of cooperation or endorsements. Additionalmaterial should not be attached unless it is essential to impart a clearunderstanding of the project. B. Selection Criteria 1. All concept papers will be evaluated by the staff on the basis of thefollowing criteria: a. The demonstration of need for the project; b. The soundness and innovativeness of the approach described; c. The benefits to be derived from the project; and d. The reasonableness of the proposed budget. 2. ``Special Interest'' category concept papers submitted  pursuant tosection II.B will also be rated on the proposed project's relationshipto one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in that section,and the degree to which the findings, procedures, training, technology,or other results of the project can be transferred to other jurisdictions.3. ``Single jurisdiction'' concept papers submitted pursuant to sectionII.C will be rated on the proposed project's relation to one of the ``SpecialInterest'' categories set forth in section II.B, and on the special requirementslisted in section II.C.2. 4. In determining which concept papers will be selected for developmentinto full applications, the Institute will also consider the availabilityof financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amountand nature (cash or in-kind) of the submitter's anticipated match; whetherthe submitter is a ``priority applicant'' under the Institute's enablinglegislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1) and section IV above); and the extentto which the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts orhelp the State courts enforce Federal constitutional and legislative requirements.C. Review Process Concept papers will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors.Institute staff will prepare a narrative summary of each paper, and a ratingsheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion. Committeesof the Board will review concept papers within assigned program areas andprepare recommendations for the full Board. The full Board of Directorswill then decide which concept paper applicants should be invited to submitformal applications for funding. The decision to invite an applicationis solely that of the Board of Directors. D. Submission Requirements An original and three copies of all concept papers submitted for considerationin Fiscal Year 1989 must be sent by first class or overnight mail, or bycourier no later than February 2, 1989.

Receipt of each concept paper will be acknowledged in writing. Extensionsof the deadline for receipt of concept papers will not be granted. The Board expects to meet in late March 1989 to review the concept papersand invite applications. The Institute will send written notice to allpersons submitting concept papers of the Board's decisions regarding theirpapers and of the key issues and questions that arose during the reviewprocess. A decision by the Board not to invite an application may not beappealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of the concept paper or arevision thereof in a subsequent round of funding. The State Chief Justiceand State Court Administrator will be notified when the Board invites applicationsthat are based on concept papers submitted by courts within their Stateor which include a participating site within their State.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.

A decision bythe Board to deny an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibitresubmission of a concept paper based on that application in a subsequentround of funding. The State Chief Justice and State Court Administratorwill be notified when grants are approved by the Board to support projectsthat will be conducted by or involve courts in their State.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Renewal Funding Procedures and Requirements </ITAG>The Institute recognizes two types of renewal funding. The first, a ``continuationgrant,'' is to permit completion of activities initiated under an existingInstitute grant or to enhance the knowledge, programs or services producedor established during the prior grant period. Continuation grants are intendedto support projects with a limited duration. They may be used, for example,when a project is divided into two or more sequential phases, for secondaryanalysis of data obtained in an Institute-supported research project, orfor more extensive testing of an innovative technology, procedure, or programdeveloped with SJI grant support. Continuation grants are subject to thelimits on size and duration set forth in sections V.B.1 and V.C.1. The second, an on-going support grant, is to support a project that isnational in scope and that provides the State courts with services, programsor products for which there is a continuing important need. On-going supportgrants are subject to the limits on size and duration set forth in sectionsV.B.2. and V.C.2. A. Continuation Grants 1. In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking a continuation grant mustinform the Institute, by letter, of its intent to submit an applicationfor such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparentbut no less than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. a. A letter of intent must be no more than 3 single-spaced pages on 8\1/2\by 11 inch paper and must contain an estimate of the funds to be requestedand a brief description of anticipated changes in scope, focus or audienceof the project. b. Letters of intent will not be reviewed competitively. Within 30 daysof receiving a letter of intent, the Institute will inform the granteefiling of the date by which an application for a continuation grant mustbe submitted. 2. An application for a continuation grant must include an applicationform, budget forms (with appropriate documentation), a project abstractconforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative,a budget narrative, and certain certifications and assurances. The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirementsset forth in section VII.C. However, rather than the topics listed in sectionVII.C., the program narrative of an application for a continuation grantshould: a. Explain why continuation of the project is necessary to achieve thegoals of the project, and how the continuation will benefit the participatingcourts or the courts community generally. That is, to what extent willthe goals and objectives of the project be unfulfilled if the project isnot continued, and conversely, how will the findings or results of theproject be enhanced by continuing the project? b. Discuss the status of all activities conducted during the previous projectperiod, identify any activities that were not completed, and explain why;c. Present a detailed task schedule for the next project period; d. Specify the key findings or recommendations resulting from the evaluationof the project, if they are available, and explain how they will be addressedduring the proposed continuation; e. Describe fully any other changes to the tasks to be performed, the methodsto be used, the products of the project, the assigned staff, or the grantee'sorganizational capacity; f. Indicate why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriateor unavailable; and g. Provide a complete budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirementsset forth in paragraph VII.D. Changes in the funding level requested shouldbe discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scopeof activities or services to be rendered. 3. An application for a continuation grant should not repeat informationcontained in a previously approved application. 4. The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E., other thanthe deadline for mailing, apply to applications for a continuation grant.Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth insection VIII.B. The key findings and recommendations resulting from anevaluation of the project and the proposed response to those findings andrecommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process,return policy, and notification procedures are the same as those for newprojects set forth in sections VIII.C.-VIII.E. B. On-going Support Grants 1. A project is eligible for consideration for an on-going support grantif: a. The project is supported by and has been evaluated under a grant fromthe Institute; b. The project is national in scope and provides a significant benefitto the State courts; c. There is a continuing important need for the services, programs or productsprovided by the project as indicated by the level of use and support bymembers of the court community; d. The project is accomplishing its objectives in an effective and efficientmanner; and e. It is likely that the service or program provided by the project wouldbe curtailed or significantly reduced without Institute support. 2. The Board will consider awarding an on-going support grant for a periodof up to 36 months. The total amount of the grant will be fixed at thetime of the initial award. Funds will be made available in annual incrementsas specified in section V.B.2. Each project supported by an on-going support grant must include an evaluationcomponent assessing its effectiveness and operation throughout the grantperiod. A comprehensive evaluation report must be completed not less than90 days before the end of the grant period.3. In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking an on-going support grantmust inform the Institute by letter of its intent to submit an applicationfor such funding no less than 120 days before the end of the current grantperiod. The letter of intent should be in the same format as that prescribedfor continuation grants in section IX. A.1.a. 4. An application for an on-going support grant must include an applicationform, budget forms (with appropriate documentation), a project abstractconforming to the format set forth in section VII.B, a program narrative,a budget narrative, and certain certifications and assurances. The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirementsset forth in section VII.C. However, rather than the topics listed in sectionVII.C, the program narrative of applications for an on-going support grantshould: a. Provide a detailed discussion of the benefits provided by the projectto the State courts around the country, including the degree to which Statecourts, State court judges, or State court managers and personnel are usingthe services or programs provided by the project; b. Demonstrate support for the continuation of the project from the courtscommunity; c. Discuss the extent to which the project has met its goals and objectives,identify any activities that have not been completed, and explain why;d. Present a general schedule for the full proposed project period anda detailed task schedule for the first year of the proposed new projectperiod; e. Attach a copy of the final evaluation report regarding the effectivenessand operation of the project, specify the key findings or recommendationsresulting from the evaluation, and explain how they will be addressed duringthe proposed renewal period; f. Describe fully any other changes to the tasks to be performed, the methodsto be used, the products of the project, the assigned staff, or the grantee'sorganizational capacity; g. Indicate why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriateor unavailable; and h. Provide a complete budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirementsset forth in paragraph VII.D. Changes in the funding level requested shouldbe discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scopeof activities or services to be rendered. 5. An application for an on-going support grant should not repeat informationcontained in a previously approved application. 6. The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E other than thedeadline for mailing apply to applications for an on-going support grant.Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth insection VIII.B. The extent to which the project has met its goals and objectives,the key findings and recommendations resulting from an evaluation of theproject, and the proposed response to those findings and recommendationswill also be considered. The review and approval process, return policy,and notification procedures are the same as those for new applicationsset forth in sections VII.C-VII.E.<ITAG tagnum="84">X.

B. Supervision and Monitoring Responsibilities <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Grantee Responsibilities </ITAG>All grantees receiving direct awards from the Institute are responsiblefor the management and fiscal control of all funds. Responsibilities includethe accounting of receipts and expenditures, the maintaining of adequatefinancial records and the refunding of expenditures disallowed by audits.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Responsibilities of State Supreme Court </ITAG>Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved,consistent with State law, by the State's Supreme Court, or its designatedagency or council. The State Supreme Court shall receive all Institute funds awarded to suchcourts and shall be responsible for assuring proper administration of Institutefunds. The State Supreme Court is responsible for all aspects of the projectincluding proper accounting and financial recordkeeping by the subgrantee.The responsibilities include: a. <T3>Reviewing financial operations. </T3>The State Supreme Court shouldbe familiar with, and periodically monitor, its subgrantees' financialoperations, records system and procedures.

C. Accounting System The grantee is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequatesystem of accounting and internal controls for itself and for ensuringthat an adequate system exists for each of its subgrantees and contractors.An acceptable and adequate accounting system is considered to be one which:1. Properly accounts for receipt of funds under each grant awarded andthe expenditure of funds for each grant by category of expenditure (includingmatching contributions and project income); 2. Assures that expended funds are applied to the appropriate budget categoryincluded within the approved grant; 3. Presents and classifies historical costs of the grant as required forbudgetary and evaluation purposes; 4. Provides cost and property controls to assure optimal use of grant funds;5. Is integrated with a system of internal controls adequate to safeguardthe funds and assets covered, check the accuracy and reliability of theaccounting data, promote operational efficiency, and assure conformancewith any general or special conditions of the grant; 6. Meets the prescribed requirements for periodic financial reporting ofoperations; and 7. Provides financial data for planning, control, measurement, and evaluationof direct and indirect costs.D. Total Cost Budgeting and Accounting Accounting for all funds awarded by the Institute shall be structured andexecuted on a ``total project cost'' basis. That is, total project costs,including Institute funds, State and local matching shares, and any otherfund sources included in the approved project budget shall be the foundationfor fiscal administration and accounting. Grant applications and financialreports require budget and cost estimates on the basis of total costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Timing of Matching Contributions </ITAG>Matching contributions need not be applied at the exact time of the obligationof Institute funds. However, the full matching share must be obligatedby the end of the period for which the Institute funds have been made availablefor obligation under an approved project. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Records for Match </ITAG>All grantees must maintain records which clearly show the source, amount,and timing of all matching contributions. In addition, if a project hasincluded, within its approved budget, contributions which exceed the requiredmatching portion, the grantee must maintain records of those contributionsin the same manner as it does the Institute funds and required matchingshares. For all grants made to State and local courts, the State SupremeCourt has primary responsibility for grantee/subgrantee compliance withthe requirements of this section. (See XI.B.2.) E. Maintenance and Retention of Records All financial records, supporting documents, statistical records and allother records pertinent to grants, subgrants, cooperative agreements orcontracts under grants shall be retained by each organization participatingin a project for at least three years for purposes of examination and audit.State Supreme Courts may impose record retention and maintenance requirementsin addition to those prescribed in this chapter. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Coverage </ITAG>The retention requirement extends to books of original entry, source documentssupporting accounting transactions, the general ledger, subsidiary ledgers,personnel and payroll records, cancelled checks, and related documentsand records. Source documents include copies of all grant and subgrantawards, applications, and required grantee/subgrantee financial and narrativereports. Personnel and payroll records shall include the time and attendancereports for all individuals reimbursed under a grant, subgrant or contract,whether they are employed full-time or part-time. Time and effort reportswill be required for consultants. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Retention Period </ITAG>The three-year retention period starts from the date of the submissionof the final expenditure report or, for grants which are renewed annually,from the date of submission of the annual expenditure report. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Maintenance </ITAG>Grantees and subgrantees are expected to see that records of differentfiscal years are separately identified and maintained so that requestedinformation can be readily located. Grantees and subgrantees are also obligatedto protect records adequately against fire or other damage. When recordsare stored away from the grantee's/subgrantee's principal office, a writtenindex of the location of stored records should be on hand, and ready accessshould be assured. F. Project-Related Income Records of the receipt and disposition of project-related income must bemaintained by the grantee in the same manner as required for the projectfunds that gave rise to the income. The policies governing the dispositionof the various types of project-related income are listed below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Interest </ITAG>A State and any agency or instrumentality of a State including State institutionsof higher education and State hospitals, shall not be held accountablefor interest earned on advances of project funds. When funds are awardedto subgrantees through a State, the subgrantees are not held accountablefor interest earned on advances of project funds. Local units of governmentthat are direct grantees and nonprofit organizations must refund any interestearned. Grantees shall so order their affairs to ensure minimum balancesin their respective grant cash accounts. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Other Project Income </ITAG>a. <T3>Royalties. </T3>The grantee/subgrantee may retain all royalties receivedfrom copyrights or other works developed under projects or from patentsand inventions, unless the terms and conditions of the project provideotherwise. b. <T3>Registration/tuition fees and other. </T3>These types of project income shall be treated in accordance with dispositioninstructions set forth in the project's terms and conditions. G. Payments and Financial Reporting Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Payment of Grant Funds </ITAG>The procedures and regulations set forth below are applicable to all Institutegrant funds and grantees. a. <T3>Request for advance or reimbursement of funds. </T3>Grantees will receivefunds on a ``Check-Issued'' basis. Upon receipt, review, and approval ofa Request for Advance or Reimbursement by the Institute, a check will beissued directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent. A requestmust be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs. The Request forAdvance or Reimbursement, along with the instructions for its preparation,will be included in the official Institute award package.b. <T3>Termination of advance funding. </T3>When a grantee organization receivingcash advances from the Institute_ i. Demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to attain program or projectgoals, or to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsingbetween cash advances and disbursements, or cannot adhere to guidelinerequirements or special conditions; ii. Engages in the improper award and administration of subgrants or contracts;or iii. Is unable to submit reliable and/or timely reports,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Institute may terminate advance financing and require the granteeorganization to finance its operations with its own working capital. Paymentsto the grantee shall then be made by the use of the Institute check methodto reimburse the grantee for actual cash disbursements. In the event thegrantee continues to be deficient, the Institute reserves the right tosuspend payments until the deficiencies are corrected. c. <T3>Principle of minimum cash on hand. </T3>Recipient organizations shouldrequest funds based upon immediate disbursement requirements. Granteesshould time their requests to ensure that cash on hand is the minimum neededfor disbursements to be made immediately or within a few days. Idle fundsin the hands of subgrantees will impair the goals of good cash management.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Financial Reporting </ITAG>In order to obtain financial information concerning the use of funds, theInstitute requires that grantees/subgrantees of these funds submit timelyreports for review. The Financial Status Report is required from all grantees for each activequarter on a calendar-quarter basis. This report is due within 30 daysafter the close of the calendar quarter. It is designed to provide financialinformation relating to Institute funds, State and local matching shares,and any other fund sources included in the approved project budget. Thereport contains information on obligations as well as outlays. A copy ofthe Financial Status Report, along with instructions for its preparation,will be included in the official Institute Award package. In circumstanceswhere an organization requests substantial payments for a project priorto the completion of a given quarter, the Institute may request a briefsummary of the amount requested, by object class, in support of the Requestfor Advance or Reimbursement. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Consequences of Non-Compliance with Submission Requirements </ITAG>Failure of the grantee organization to submit required financial and programreports may result in a suspension of grant payments. H. Allowability of Costs <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General </ITAG>Except as may be otherwise provided in the conditions of a particular grant,cost allowability shall be determined in accordance with the principlesset forth in <T3>OMB Circulars A-87, </T3>Cost Principles for State and Local Governments;<T3>A-21, </T3>Cost Principles Applicable to Grants and Contracts withEducational Institutions; and <T3>A-122, </T3>Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Costs Requiring Prior Approval </ITAG>a. <T3>Preagreement costs. </T3>The written prior approval of the Instituteis required for costs which are considered necessary to the project butoccur prior to the starting date of the grant period. b. <T3>Equipment. </T3>Grant funds may be used to purchase or lease only thatequipment which is essential to accomplishing the goals and objectivesof the project. The written prior approval of the Institute is requiredwhen the amount of automated data processing (ADP) equipment to be purchasedor leased exceeds $10,000 or the software to be purchased exceeds $3,000.c. <T3>Consultants. </T3>The written prior approval of the Institute is requiredwhen the rate of compensation to be paid a consultant exceeds $200 a day.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Indirect Costs </ITAG>These are costs of an organization that are not readily assignable to aparticular project, but are necessary to the operation of the organizationand the performance of the project. The cost of operating and maintainingfacilities, depreciation, and administrative salaries are examples of thetypes of costs that are usually treated as indirect costs. It is the policyof the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, ifa recipient has an indirect cost rate approved by a Federal agency as setforth below, the Institute will accept that rate. a. <T3>Approved Plan Available. </T3>(1) The Institute will accept an indirectcost rate or allocation plan approved for a grantee during the precedingtwo years by any Federal granting agency on the basis of allocation methodssubstantially in accord with those set forth in the applicable cost circulars.A copy of the approved rate agreement must be submitted to the Institute.(2) Where flat rates are accepted in lieu of actual indirect costs, granteesmay not also charge expenses normally included in overhead pools, e.g.,accounting services, legal services, building occupancy and maintenance,etc., as direct costs. (3) Organizations with an approved indirect cost rate, utilizing totaldirect costs as the base, usually exclude contracts under grants from anyoverhead recovery. The negotiation agreement will stipulate that contractsare excluded from the base for overhead recovery. b. <T3>Establishment of indirect cost rates. </T3>In order to be reimbursedfor indirect costs, a grantee or organization must first establish an appropriateindirect cost rate. To do this, the grantee must prepare an indirect costrate proposal and submit it to the Institute. The proposal must be submittedin a timely manner (within three months after the start of the grant period)to assure recovery of the full amount of allowable indirect costs, andit must be developed in accordance with principles and procedures appropriateto the type of grantee institution involved. c. <T3>No approved plan. </T3>If an indirect cost proposal for recovery ofactual indirect costs is not submitted to the Institute within three monthsafter the start of the grant period, indirect costs will be irrevocablydisallowed for all months prior to the month that the indirect cost proposalis received. This policy is effective for all grant awards.I. Procurement and Property Management Standards <ITAG tagnum="81">1.
