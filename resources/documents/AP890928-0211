The 72-year-old former president died Thursday in a Honoluluhospital of cardiac arrest.   ``I know he was a strongman,'' recalled Primitivo Lovina, anassociate of Marcos when the two served in the House ofRepresentatives. ``But his greatest weakness was he had a softheart for friends. I think that caused his downfall.''   Conversations with former associates of Marcos reveal a complexfigure _ magnanimous and petty; heroic and shallow.   ``Apo was very, very cordial and warm to us regardless of whoyou are,'' recalled former Marcos bodyguard Romeo Amansec,referring to the former president by a Filipino honorific fordistinguished man.   Amansec said Marcos always told his employees that if they hadany problems, they were to go to his military chief of staff, Gen.Fabian Ver.   ``If he cannot help you, I will,'' Amansec quoted Marcos assaying.   Marcos was a study in contrast.   He was a brilliant student who topped the national barexaminations in 1939. But as president, he flouted and manipulatedthe law to amass power and wealth.   Marcos drafted grandiose plans for a ``New Society'' to propelhis impoverished nation into social justice and prosperity. Butunder his ``New Society,'' his family and friends prospered at theexpense of millions of his countrymen whose living standardsplummeted.   The man who would in 1972 impose martial law and imprisonthousands was also remembered as a passionate youth who courtedwomen with roses and poems.   ``When it comes to women, he's a gentleman. He is like a SirWalter Raleigh. He uses poetic language.'' said Lovina.   Marcos' charm was tempered with a passionate jealousy. After hewooed and wed Imelda Romualdez in an 11-day courtship in 1954,Lovina, a former Imelda suitor, ran into the newlyweds in a Manilatheater.   ``I was with my girlfriend then and we said `congratulations andbest wishes,''' Lovina said. ``I told Meldy, `You didn't even tellme were getting married. I just read it in the papers.' She said,`I also didn't expect it.' Then you know what happened? Marcospulled Imelda's hand and dragged her away from us. We were reallysurprised,'' Lovina said.   Lovina, who knew Imelda before she met Marcos, never got intouch with her again for fear of offending her husband. At a golfcourse several weeks later, Lovina and Imelda stood beside eachother like strangers in front of Marcos. But after Marcos left forthe clubhouse, Imelda turned to Lovina and apologized.   More than 30 years later, Lovina visited the Marcos family intheir Hawaiian exile. He joked about the chilly reception hereceived during their meeting at the theater.   According to Lovina, Marcos told him, ``You had a reputation ofbeing a playboy. I was very young then.''   Friends recall Marcos as a master political tactician, who usedImelda as one of his ``aces'' when all else failed. Duringpolitical campaigns, Imelda was always there to charm the crowds.   ``Marcos always worked using three OPLANS (operations plans),''said Jesus Quevenco, a Marcos look-alike who served as a``stand-in'' for Marcos during the runup to his 1965 election aspresident.   ``Imelda was always the last resort,'' Quevenco said. ``And thatnever fails.''   In the final years of his presidency, Marcos faced severalassassination attempts, always _ according to former aides _ withaplomb.   Amansec, a former navy explosives expert, recalls disarmingseveral bombs, including one at the Manila Folk Arts Center in1985, which he says could have leveled the building.   Amansec, now a hotel security guard, said that when thepresident was told of the attempt, Marcos replied calmly: ``Is thatso?''   ``He got the brains, the personality, the leadership but Ibelieve that he did not use them really properly,'' Lovina said.``Had he done it, we would have been the greatest nation in theworld.''</TEXT></DOC>
