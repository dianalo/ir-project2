The court had rejected the interpretation of Illinois law advanced by the state's own officials and had done so, he felt, without giving an adequate explanation. This breach wasn't to be taken lightly, and last year Judge Easterbrook, appointed by President Reagan in 1985, urged the full, 11-member court in writing to rehear the case together and overrule the three-judge panel.    &quot;This is no way to treat state governments,&quot; wrote Judge Easterbrook, a forceful, 39-year-old former University of Chicago Law School professor and disciple of former Judge Robert Bork.    The procedure suggested by Judge Easterbrook for a full-court rehearing is called &quot;en banc&quot; review, and it has become a weapon for some Reagan appointees seeking to steer federal courts in a more conservative direction. To many judges, it is among the most cumbersome, time-consuming and divisive procedures that exist in the federal courts. The rules for the 12 regional federal appeals courts say, &quot;Such a . . . rehearing is not favored,&quot; and should be held only on matters of &quot;exceptional importance&quot; or when there is a need for &quot;uniformity.&quot;    But federal appeals court judges appointed by President Reagan are making greater use of this device in some parts of the country, where they are in the majority, to overturn precedents that they don't like. Moreover, full-court review, or the threat of it, sends a potent message to recalcitrant liberal judges appointed by President Carter, or even by President Johnson, who are out-of-step with the increasingly conservative federal courts.    &quot;There is increasing resort to en bancs to overrule venerable, heretofore respected . . . precedents,&quot; said Chief Judge Patricia Wald of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a Carter appointee, in a 1986 speech at Cleveland State University Law School. &quot;The shift is plainly a symptom of the rapidly changing makeup of the court,&quot; Judge Wald said.    The changing makeup of the federal appellate and district courts is part of President Reagan's legacy of 343 judicial appointments, or 46% of the total at latest count. This includes 78 appeals court judges out of 168. These judges are changing the role of the federal courts from active guardians of civil liberties to more reserved referees of disputes.    One effect of en banc cases, Judge Wald said, is to &quot;heighten tensions&quot; among the judges. An appeals court judge in the Midwest, appointed by Mr. Reagan but skeptical of increased en banc hearings, labels his colleagues who push for more full-court reviews the &quot;truth squad.&quot; On another court, a liberal judge calls the Reagan appointees &quot;thought police.&quot;    As the number of judges appointed by Mr. Reagan increases, en banc hearings in the appeals courts grow as well. In the last four years, as Reagan appointees have begun flexing their muscles, the number of en banc decisions increased 33%, to a total of 88 last year, according to the Adminstrative Office of the U.S. Courts. But from 1976 through 1983, as Carter appointees joined the bench, the number of en banc hearings grew only 5% to 66, after a one-year high of 74 in 1982. During the Carter period, en banc review grew more slowly than the number of judges, but during the Reagan years, the en banc increase was faster than the growth in judges.    The number is small next to the more than 18,000 decisions by the appeals courts each year. But en banc cases use up judges' time, delay decisions by a year or more, and divide courts, producing multiple concurring and dissenting opinions.    Explanations for the increased use vary. &quot;Newer judges are requesting en banc procedures in routine cases that are not of great importance,&quot; says Chief Judge Donald Lay of the appeals court in St. Louis. Says Chief Judge Harrison Winter of the appeals court in Richmond, Va., &quot;The notion has gotten around, not limited to Reagan appointees, that whenever you don't agree with a panel opinion, you try to review and overturn it.&quot;    But conservatives see a clearer purpose. &quot;The greater prevalence of en banc review,&quot; says Bruce Fein, a courtswatcher at the conservative Heritage Foundation, &quot;is because Reagan appointees are more aggressive about pursuing a philosophical agenda to put some coherence into the law of their circuits.&quot;    Divided courts in en banc cases have been noticeable in the appeals courts in Washington, Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where judges appointed by President Reagan hold a majority.    In Washington, tension emerged publicly last summer when the court changed course and decided against holding en banc hearings in four cases on which such hearings had been planned. Reagan appointees on the court had voted to rehear the cases, but one of them, Judge Laurence Silberman, changed his mind and a majority no longer favored rehearing.    Announcement of this switch was accompanied by six separate opinions, totaling 27 pages, on whether such rehearings should be held.    Judge Harry Edwards, a Carter appointee, wrote that the Reagan appointees were trying to transform the standard of &quot;exceptional importance&quot; into a &quot;self-serving and result-oriented criterion.&quot; Five Reagan appointees, led by Judge Bork, wrote that the three-judge panel decisions were &quot;at the very least, highly dubious.&quot;    When a majority can't be persuaded to vote for en banc review, a judge can turn to a technique employed by Judge Bork and others: issuing an opinion aimed at persuading the Supreme Court to take the case, if it is appealed there, and to reverse the three-judge panel's ruling. In the racetrack case, Illinois officials appealed to the Supreme Court and Judge Easterbrook's opinion was included in the record, but the high court recently denied review.    In Chicago, court sources say Judge Easterbrook, a conservative intellectual force, has urged a Reagan-appointed majority to make greater use of en banc review. Defending the use of such rehearings, Judge Easterbrook said in a recent interview, &quot;It's a stabilizing process that makes sure the majority's voice is heard.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
