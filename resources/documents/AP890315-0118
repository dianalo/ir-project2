The chancery is said to be riddled with eavesdropping devices andhas not been used.   Among the options, said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, were:   _ Razing the chancery and building a new one. That could cost anestimated $500 million.   _ Dismantling and rebuilding three stories and constructing anannex for the most sensitive work, as suggested in a study by formerDefense Secretary James R. Schlesinger.   _ Clearing the new embassy of eavesdropping devices, asrecommended by Anne Armstrong, head of former President Reagan'sForeign Intelligence Advisory Board.   In the meantime, Nicholas M. Salgo, a former ambassador toHungary, was appointed last week to develop plans for facilities inMoscow that meet U.S. security requirements.   Salgo made similar studies in China, East Germany and Bulgaria.</TEXT></DOC>
