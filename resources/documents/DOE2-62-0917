These techniques form an importantcompliment to laboratory experiments for providing a better understandingof spectroscopic properties, as well as the energetics of the solid systems.For ideal metallic and semiconducting crystal lattice with translationalsymmetry, the conventional energy band structure approaches are capableto provide a good degree of precision in both electronic structure andsystem energies. On the other hand the molecular-cluster model representsa convenient method of studying those properties that are primarily afunction of the local environment of the system, such as vacancy, substitutionaland interstitial defects. In this paper, the authors present some preliminaryresults of electronic structure of substitutional defects and vacancyin binary and ternary cubic zirconium oxides obtained by the embeddedmolecular-cluster model calculation. The importance of electronic chargeredistribution in the solids where the defect is introduced into theperfect lattice is highlighted and the effect of electron polarizationof the surrounding ions of the defect is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
