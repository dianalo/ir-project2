PAUL, Minn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   NWA Inc. said a combination of rising fares and increased traffic helped double second quarter net income to a record $70.8 million, or $2.38 a share.    Analysts said NWA's airline unit, Northwest Airlines, benefited from the machinists' strike at Eastern Airlines, which forced such other carriers as American Airlines to shift some of their fleets into Miami and farther away from direct competition with Northwest.    What's more, Northwest wasn't hurt significantly by Eastern's slow rebuilding of its service this summer, offering discount fares to woo passengers. Many other major U.S. carriers are expected to report second quarter results this week.    Meanwhile, investor Alfred Checchi extended his $121-a-share tender offer for NWA through yesterday as he cleared up financing paperwork and waited for regulatory clearance for the $3.65 billion transaction.    Analysts said the extension doesn't signal any problems with the tender offer, even though Mr. Checchi had expected to wrap up the acquisition as early as Friday, which is when the tender offer was originally slated to expire. By that time, more than 99% of NWA common shares outstanding had been tendered under the offer, a spokeswoman for Mr. Checchi said.    According to the spokeswoman, Mr. Checchi extended the offer until 5 p.m. EST yesterday, and would probably extend it until he gets regulatory clearance for the purchase.    Mr. Checchi can't complete the purchase until the Federal Trade Commission gives him antitrust clearance. Mr. Checchi is asking the agency to end early the waiting period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, which is slated to expire tomorrow.    Also, the Department of Transportation hasn't completed its review of the transaction. While the department can't block the purchase outright, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has expressed concern about the debt the transaction would impose on NWA.    The potential for labor unrest is also clouding the pact. While two groups of Northwest pilots said last week that they will support Mr. Checchi's acquisition, the pilots' union is on the brink of a confrontation with Northwest Airlines management over contract negotiations, which have been conducted under the supervision of a federal mediator since December.    The two sides appear far from agreement. Talks broke off on Friday, then resumed yesterday.    NWA attributed the rise in earnings to a 16% jump in traffic and a 3.2% increase in yield, or revenue passenger miles, from a year earlier. In the 1988 quarter, NWA earned $28.4 million, or 97 cents a share.    NWA said second quarter operating revenues climbed 19.3% to $1.65 billion from $1.38 billion for the 1988 quarter.    In the first six months, net was $83.3 million, or $2.82 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $15.1 million. Operating revenue rose 19.3% to $3.13 billion from $2.62 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
