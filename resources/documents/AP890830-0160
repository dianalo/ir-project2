A major outbreak of black unrest in South Africa in 1984 was apivotal event in that nation's financial affairs, prompting manyU.S. banks and corporations to dissolve their investments in SouthAfrica.   In 1985, New York City passed an ordinance specifying that banksproviding city services could not extend new loans to Pretoria.   But a report by the U.N. Commission on TransnationalCorporations, released Wednesday, said that ``although a number ofcountries have reduced their trade with South Africa, there isevidence that other corporations have filled some of this gap.''   It said Japan increased its imports from South Africa by $455million in 1987, compared with the average annual level of importsfrom 1983-85.   In the same period, Taiwan's imports increased by $242 million,Turkey's by $268 million, and West German imports increased $187million.   U.S. imports dropped $557 million in 1987, Danish imports fell$92 million and British imports were off by $91 million.   West Germany increased its exports to South Africa by $357million in 1987, compared with the annual average in 1983-85, thereport said. Taiwan's exports were up $171 million, and Japaneseexports rose by $130 million.   At the same time, U.S. exports to South Africa fell by $349million, it said.   The report concluded, ``International pressures may be appliedthrough foreign trade, disinvestment, and foreign finance.''   ``Disinvestment is perhaps the area with the least significantimmediate impact,'' partly because most disinvesting companies selloff their plants or create other non-equity relationships.   ``These relationships allow for transfers of technology to theSouth African economy which are essential to the functioning of thateconomy,'' the U.N. report noted.   It said the electronics and automotive industries in South Africaparticularly benefited from technology transfer through ``equitylinks, licensing, trade, purchase of know-how and through the flowof human resources.''   The report cited a news release from Ford after its disinvestmentfrom South Africa as an example of the irrelevance of equityrelationships to the transfer of vital technology.   Ford passed along its equity in SAMCOR, the South African localFord plant, to the local work force.   The U.N. report quotes Ford as saying afterward, ``Ford willcontinue to provide SAMCOR with necessary components, licensed useof the Ford trademark and management and technical assistance asneeded.''</TEXT></DOC>
