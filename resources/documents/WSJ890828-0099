The market value of OTC stocks held by foreign investors rose 64% from the end of 1985 through the first quarter of this year, according to the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq system for trading OTC issues. In the same period, the number of positions, or stakes in individual OTC stocks, rose 9.6%.    &quot;Foreign institutions are now learning that to have a totally representative portfolio in U.S. stocks, they really should be participating in the small and medium-capitalized stocks,&quot; says Joseph R. Hardiman, president of NASD.    But the Nasdaq market hasn't completely conquered its foreign-relations challenge. Some investors still consider OTC stocks too obscure, and many turn their noses up at small-company issues.    Alain Adam, a managing director of Furman Selz Mayer Dietz andamp; Birney in London, says New York and American stock exchange issues remain the first choice of foreign investors. &quot;The broader averages {of large stocks} have performed so well there hasn't been a need to go into a smaller sphere&quot; of small-capitalization issues, Mr. Adam says.    Still, says Jack Conlon, executive vice president in charge of the equity division for Nikko Securities Co. in New York, even a small increase in overseas investment in OTC stocks is significant. &quot;The fact that it's occurring at all is telling, because historically the interest wasn't in OTC stocks,&quot; he says.    A reduction of international barriers to investment in the U.S.'s OTC stocks has helped boost such activity.    Canada recently dropped restrictions on how much its pension funds could invest in stocks not traded on a formal exchange. West Germany is expected to take similar steps in October, Mr. Hardiman says.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's largest exchange, recently announced it would list qualifying U.S. OTC stocks. Previously, OTC stocks were barred because they weren't listed on a formal exchange in the U.S.    Even though the majority of Japanese trading in OTC stocks occurs in the U.S., the Tokyo listing is important, Mr. Hardiman says. &quot;It is a recognition of the quality of the NASD market,&quot; he says. &quot;They are saying NASD will be treated on a parity basis with the New York Stock Exchange.&quot;    But it wasn't so much demand from foreign investors as requests from U.S. companies that caused the Tokyo exchange's action. U.S. companies can't raise capital in Japan unless they are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The inability to gain that listing was one of the reasons cited by two banking corporations, First Union and National City, for leaving Nasdaq within the past two years and moving to the New York Stock Exchange, an NASD official says.    While trade restrictions are decreasing, the flow of information about OTC stocks is increasing, making it easier to track the stocks.    The NASD holds seminars in Europe and Asia for investors who might be interested in the stocks. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. recently sent a team on a tour of European capitals to promote OTC issues. Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, says investors were very receptive.    Foreign investors remain most interested in Nasdaq's biggest and most popular stocks, such as MCI Communications, Apple Computer and Intel. That's because it's easier to find news and investment analysis on them, says Tom Callahan, executive vice president of U.S. equities for Yamaichi Securities Co.    &quot;If they get into second or third-tier stocks,&quot; there may be few if any securities analysts following the issues, Mr. Callahan says, and this &quot;makes {the stocks} difficult to follow from a long way off.&quot;    Foreign investors also may shy away from OTC stocks, especially smaller ones, because of concern that the issues might not be as liquid -- or easy to buy and sell readily -- as the bigger stocks.    &quot;If they stay liquid, they can quickly buy and sell 100,000 shares, which isn't the case with some of the OTC stocks,&quot; Mr. Callahan says.    Recognizing that foreign investors might like professionals in the U.S. to do their stock-picking for them, T. Rowe Price Associates started its New Frontier Fund in 1985. The fund is 85%-invested in OTC issues, specializes in small companies with strong growth potential and is owned primarily by foreign investors.    &quot;These people just can't be in the flow of information that we can over here,&quot; says fund manager Debra J. Diamond, &quot;which is why they are interested in this fund.&quot;    Other money managers say foreign investors will embrace smaller OTC stocks with more fervor than they do now when the smaller issues start to outperform the larger ones.    &quot;I don't think they are any different than anyone who invests money,&quot; says Richard A. Bruno, managing director of over-the-counter trading at PaineWebber. &quot;They are looking for a business they can understand, where there is growth opportunity and the stock is well priced.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity    The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.87 to 466.75 on skimpy volume of 126.7 million shares. For the week, the composite rose 1%. The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 1.45 to 463.13, while the Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest non-financial issues improved 0.85 to 441.64.    Two takeover stocks had big jumps. Syracuse Supply surged 2 1/8 to 15 1/2 after a management group offered $16.25 a share for the company.    Bel Fuse was the biggest percentage gainer, rising 1 1/2 to 6 1/4. Santa Monica Partners and Initio have proposed a joint purchase of the maker of electronic parts for $7.50 a share.    Several bank stocks were higher. Merchants Bank of New York got a boost when it raised its quarterly dividend to 40 cents a share from 25 cents. The issue was the second biggest point gainer in OTC trading, jumping 5 to 136.    Hibernia gained 1 to 23 1/4 after the banking company said it acquired all the deposits and certain assets of First State Bank. Terms weren't disclosed.    One Valley Bancorp of West Virginia slipped 1/2 to 22 after it signed a letter of intent to acquire Farmers andamp; Citizens State Bank, Clendenin, W.Va., for $160 a share, or an indicated $2.4 million.    Meanwhile, Colorocs improved 1/2 to 10 after it said it expects to break even on an operating basis in the third quarter because of heavy demand for its new color copier. Net income for the quarter is expected to be 55 cents a share after a special gain.    The developer and distributor of color copiers and printers also said that in the fourth quarter, it expects to report its first after-tax operating profit ever. The company forecasts operating earnings for the quarter of $800,000 to $1.1 million, or six cents to eight cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
