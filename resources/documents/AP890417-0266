(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. marketing firm said Monday itwill sell 1,500 laptop computers made in Hong Kong to the SovietUnion for use by reporters for Tass News Service.   Holographic Systems Inc. said the Defense Department tried toblock the $2.1 million sale of computers with Cyrillic keyboardsbut received Commerce Department approval.   The computers, made by Bondwell International of Hong Kong andFremont, Calif., use Intel Corp.'s 80286 chip and are more powerfulthan the laptops most commonly used by American reporters.   The Defense Department initially objected to the sale, citingthe quantity of computers and complaining they were ``ruggedized''for possible use in military situations.   Glenn G. Smith, president of Holographic Systems, denied thecharge. He said the deal went through recently after the DefenseDepartment failed to file a further objection following arecommendation for approval by Commerce.   Smith, who also is negotiating a joint venture with the SovietMinistry of Railways for a $20 million executive center and healthfitness club for foreign executives, said the laptop sale tookthree months to get an export license.   ``The government ought to find a way to expedite the licensingand get the Defense Department out of some of these non-strategicitems, like (personal computers),'' Smith said. ``The Soviets cango to Singapore and get a license in seven days.''</TEXT></DOC>
