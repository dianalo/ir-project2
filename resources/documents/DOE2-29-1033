Thispaper presents an outline of the acid rain issue from the Canadian perspective.Acid rain formation is briefly described, and the most important pollutantsfor acififying rain are identified as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.Sources of these pollutants in North America are identified as beingmainly from the transportation and electric power generation sectors.Considerations affecting the acid-forming potential of these pollutantsare also discussed, and the increase in emissions from tall stacks ismentioned as a factor in deposition patterns and loadings. Environmentaleffects of acid rain are summarized in the light of current knowledge.These include mortality effects on fish, damage to plants, effects onthe human respiratory system, and corrosion of man-made structures. Areasof Canada most affected by acid rain are identified as those having lowacid-buffering capacity, primarily in Ontario, Quebec and Labrador. Canadianparliamentary action on the acid rain problem has consisted in establishinga Subcommittee on Acid Rain in the House of Commons Standing Committeeon Fisheries and Forestry, and in amending the Clean Air Act to harmonizeit with comparable laws in the USA that deal with transboundary air pollution.A chronology is presented of the actions of Canada and the USA towardthe transboundary acid rain problem. 11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
