(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who a prosecutor said had an``obsession to have a child'' was found guilty but mentally illTuesday of first-degree murder in the death of a pregnant woman whowas strangled and her baby crudely cut from her womb.   The state district court jury also found Darci Pierce guilty butmentally ill of kidnapping and child abuse charges. The seven-man,five-woman jury returned the verdicts after about six hours ofdeliberations over two days.   Mrs. Pierce, 20, had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity inthe July 23, 1987, death of Cindy Lynn Ray, 23, who was 8{ monthspregnant.   Authorities said Mrs. Ray was abducted from the parking lot of aKirtland Air Force Base health clinic and was driven to the ManzanoMountains east of Albuquerque, where she was strangled and a keywas used to cut her unborn bay from her body. The baby survived.   Mrs. Pierce was arrested after she went to an Albuquerquehospital with a newborn girl and doctors determined she had notgiven birth.   Both Mrs. Pierce and the victim were married to airmen at theKirtland base.   District Judge Richard Traub set sentencing for April 29. Mrs.Pierce could receive life imprisonment on the murder conviction, anadditional 18 years on the kidnapping charge and 18 months on thechild-abuse charge.   In his closing arguments Monday, Assistant District AttorneyHarry Zimmerman said the evidence showed Mrs. Pierce had plannedher actions and knew what she was doing.   Zimmerman said Mrs. Pierce elected to take a baby ``to satisfyher obsession to have a child and, perhaps more important, to saveher marriage.''   But defense attorney John Bogren, a public defender, told jurorsthat witnesses during the trial testified Mrs. Pierce suffered froma mental illness and multiple personality disorder.   ``It is a bizarre crime. It deserves a bizarre explanation,''Bogren said.   Under state law, a jury finding of guilty but mentally ill meansthe person does not meet the legal tests for insanity but had asubstantial mental disorder that impaired judgment at the time ofthe crime.   The defendant is subject to standard sentences but the stateCorrections Department is required to provide counseling andtreatment ``as it deems necessary.''   Bogren said an appeal will be filed.   Mrs. Ray's husband, Samuel, returned to his home state of Utahwith the infant girl, named Amelia, and her 2-year-old brother.</TEXT></DOC>
