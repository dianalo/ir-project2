(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This fast-growing city next door to Denverhas set up a volunteer network of translators to help officialscommunicate with the Asian, Hispanic and other immigrants arrivinghere.   Estimates are that 8,000 residents _ or 3 percent _ of Aurora'spopulation don't speak English, causing problems for police ataccident and crime scenes. They include speakers of Pushto, Dari,Chippewa, Spanish, Czech, Farsi, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian,Urdu, Polish, Russian, Tagalog, Ukranian and sign language.   Aurora has drafted an emergency handbook for police and fireofficers to communicate with speakers of Korean, Vietnamese,Cambodian, Laotian and Chinese.   The city is also publishing a monthly newsletter for Asian- andSpanish-speaking residents in four languages, including informationabout cultural differences.   Some of the volunteer translators recall how it was to adjust tothe language and the culture.   ``Seven years ago when I came here _ it's just so difficult _you don't know what people are talking about,'' said Sun Meeks, whoemigrated from Hong Kong and now helps translate Chinese languages.   Anwar Necko emigrated from Afghanistan after the Sovietinvasion, arriving in Denver in 1982. He has volunteered to helpAurora speakers of Pushto and Dari, the official languages of hishomeland, as well as the Iranian language of Farsi.   Yves Genty, who moved to the United States from France 35 yearsago, now works for the city. He has volunteered to translateSpanish and French.   Genty got his first taste of the new volunteer program last week.   ``A young lady from Juarez, Mexico, was given a traffic ticketfor making an illegal turn and had no idea what it was all about,''he said. He translated for her in court.</TEXT></DOC>
