Mr. Levy, 61 years, also was ordered to pay a $200,000 fine while Mr. Canterino, 58, was ordered to pay $50,000. The sentencing took place in federal district court here Friday. Both men were released on $3 million bail each pending appeal of their convictions earlier this year.    The extortion attempt followed a 1985 dispute between a Darby, Pa.-record dealer, John LaMonte, and Mr. Levy's distributing company, Roulette Records, over payment for $1.3 million in records and tapes from MCA Inc.'s record division. Roulette had been billed by MCA for a shipment to Mr. LaMonte's company. Mr. LaMonte, who said he was unhappy with what he received from MCA, balked at paying Roulette. A dispute ensued and, the government alleged, Mr. LaMonte was threatened. According to the government, Mr. Canterino presided over the meetings of the extortion conspirators.    MCA, Universal City, Calif., hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing.    John Barry, an attorney for Mr. Levy, said he was sure his client would be &quot;vindicated&quot; on appeal.    Neither Mr. Canterino nor his attorney could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
