Many new technologies arebeing developed to lower engine fuel consumption, but a 10-15% reductionin fuel costs is now achievable using Rankine Bottoming Cycle (RBC) technology.System economics require integration of state of the art technology inthe turbine, heat exchangers, and automatic controls. This paper describesthe design and initial test results of a project to demonstrate a dieselengine-RBC power plant. The system was done for a Caterpillar 3500 series16-cylinder (3516) engine with a combined output of 1415 kW. Initialtest results have demonstrated a 10.4% fuel savings at a thermal efficiencyof 44.5%. The RBC module is a steam based, stand alone unit featuringunattended operation through the use of on-board water treatment, a oncethrough boiler, automatic control system, and a unique design 3 stage-dualpressure steam turbine. The modular concept allows the system to be adaptedto other engines and alternate heat sources.</TEXT></DOC>
