Bush, addessing nearly 200 natural gas suppliers, also appealedfor support for his clean air bill, which he said had emerged``relatively intact'' from a House Energy subcommittee last week.   The president, noting he once ``had a tiny interest in gaswells'' during his years as a Texas oilman, said he remains worriedabout growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, despite brighterprospects for world peace.   ``I don't like the ever increasing dependency on foreign sourcesof energy,'' he said.   He said Energy Secretary James Watkins is preparing a nationalenergy strategy that will point the way toward bolstering U.S.production.   ``That means not only more hydrocarbons, but it also means asafe, sound use of other energy sources,'' sad Bush.   Bush recently signed the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, along sought industry goal. Lifting the last government controls onprices will both spur production and help consumers over the longrun, said the president.   ``Natural gas is going to be ... vital to our domestic energysecurity,'' said Bush. ``With growing difficulties in oil and gasleasing, and difficulties in siting nuclear plants, we're going todepend more than ever ... on balanced energy sources.''   With both Watkins and Environmental Protection AgencyAdministrator William Reilly beside him, Bush said his clean airbill is ``good news for clean burning fuels'' such as natural gas.   There is ``no question your industry is going to be in theforefront, a vital part of this picture,'' said Bush.   The United States imported nearly 50 percent of its oil thispast summer, the highest level since the late 1970s. One of themain concerns is that most of the increase is coming from MiddleEastern countries, where political unrest could play havoc with theflow of oil.   Bush addressed the gas suppliers at a briefing in the OldExecutive Office Building.</TEXT></DOC>
