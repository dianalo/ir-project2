People who got an average of 12 radiation treatments for acnewere five times more likely than others to develop malignant cancerof the parotid gland, said Susan Preston-Martin, an associateprofessor of preventive medicine at the University of SouthernCalifornia. The risk of cancer was eight times normal in people whogot 15 or more treatments.   Radiation was commonly used to treat acne during the 1930s and1940s.   ``Treatment of acne with radiation is no longer common,''Preston-Martin said. ``But our findings suggest that persons whohave received this therapy should be checked periodically forparotid gland tumors.''   She and colleagues studied 139 Los Angeles County residents withmalignant parotid gland tumors and 269 with benign tumors. All werediagnosed between 1976 and 1984. Nineteen had received radiationtreatment for acne. Their tumors were diagnosed as early as sixyears and as late as 49 years after treatment.   The study found radiation's link with malignant parotid glandtumors was much stronger than with benign tumors.   In another study, Preston-Martin concluded last year thatexcessive exposure to dental X-rays correlated with parotid glandcancers. She also identified full-mouth dental X-rays given before1955 _ when doses were higher _ as the cause of meningioma, a tumorof the membrane covering the brain.</TEXT><HEAD>Middle-Age Fathers Feel Better Prepared For Parenthood</HEAD><DATELINE>OXFORD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Men who became fathers when they aremiddle-aged feel better prepared for parenthood, but those who werebetter off financially said they were less satisfied with theexperience, according to a new study.   ``I think the reason is because men at the higher socioeconomicstatus ... have had good jobs, probably traveled and had the betterthings in life,'' said Deborah Ulrich, a researcher who studied 210Ohio fathers. ``When they compare parenthood to those experiences,it just doesn't rate as high.''   Ms. Ulrich, an associate professor of nursing at MiamiUniversity, chose her study subjects from among 5,000 men betweenages 40 and 55 after examining birth certificates to find those whobecame fathers in 1986. Nearly 71 percent said they had at leastone year of college, and average annual income was about $25,000 to$30,000.   ``The advantages of being a father at mid-life were that theyfelt they were more responsible, more ready to father a child andto be an important part of the child's life,'' Ms. Ulrich said.   Nearly 90 percent of the men in the study reported being asfulfilled with fatherhood as they had anticipated. The same numbersaid they had more money to spend on a child and had reached apoint in their professional lives where they could spend less timeat work and more with the baby.   Two factors influencing satisfaction the most were the lengthand strength of a marriage, she said. Fifty-two percent of thefathers were on their second marriage. Those with shorter secondmarriages said they were happier fathers.   ``It could be that they wanted their wives _ being that newwives are usually younger _ to think that they were still youngenough to be a father and enjoy it,'' she said.   Disadvantages of parenthood reported by the fathers werephysical exhaustion and the knowledge they might not live to seetheir child grow up and have children, she said.   The study asked fathers to rate 17 factors associated withhaving a baby, including having it cry at night, not having time tospend with their wives and financial concerns. Questions onsatisfaction asked how much pleasure the fathers received from suchthings as watching the child grow.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Oct. 16</NOTE></DOC>
