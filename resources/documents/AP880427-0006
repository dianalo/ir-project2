A high-ranking Canadian official who was not identified by thePost said U.S. diplomats told Canadian officials Tuesday that theywould not accept an alternative proposal offered by Canada earlierthis month.   Under that compromise proposal, Canada agreed to a provisionthat would have resulted in smaller increases in U.S. discharges ofnitrogen oxides as long as they did not result in increases of thepollutant moving into Canada, the paper reported.   Instead, the U.S. diplomats said they would press a demand forprovisions that would increase nitrogen oxide emissions by 4million tons annually, the Post quoted the Canadian official assaying.   ``It was a total rejection,'' the Canadian was quoted as saying.``We were hoping for some progress and there's no progress at all.The main problem is it could result in a significant increase'' inthe flow of nitrogen oxides across the border into Canada.   The United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and Western andEastern European nations have been negotiating since 1983 to try tosolve air pollution problems that cross national borders.   The United States has insisted that it should get credit for thesteps it took before other countries got involved in air pollutioncontrol, such as controls on auto tailpipes and smokestackemissions that have resulted in a 14 percent reduction in nitrogenoxide pollution in the past 10 years.   The new U.S. position came on the eve of a visit to Washingtonby Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.   The two countries, in addition to participating in theinternational negotiations, have been working on a bilateralagreement on ways to reduce acid rain emissions. A senioradministration official predicted Tuesday that the two countrieswill not reach agreement on that before the Reagan administrationleaves office.</TEXT></DOC>
