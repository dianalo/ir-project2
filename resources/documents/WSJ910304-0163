Signaling the high stakes of the partisan clash, SenateJudiciary Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.) said the committeewould meet March 19 for the sole purpose of consideringPresident Bush's nomination of Judge Kenneth Ryskamp to aseat on the federal appeals court in Atlanta. Normally, thecommittee acts on three or four judicial appointees at atime.</LP><TEXT>   Amid the growing battle, People for the American Way, aleft-leaning lobbying group active in judicial politics,retracted one of its central charges against Judge Ryskamp, aReagan appointee to the federal trial bench in Miami. Thegroup conceded in a letter to Mr. Biden that it relied onfaulty numbers when it had charged that Mr. Ryskamp ruledagainst civil rights plaintiffs 90% of the time, a percentagesignificantly higher than the norm for federal judges.   The admission came after the nonpartisan AdministrativeOffice of the U.S. Courts analyzed the Ryskamp record at thejudge's request and concluded the correct figure was 73%. Theadministrative office called that proportion &quot;right in linewith&quot; those of Judge Ryskamp's colleagues nationally and insouthern Florida.   People for the American Way and its liberal allies nowinsist that the statistical comparison wasn't all thatimportant in the first place. And the liberals say theadministrative office's analysis still has technical flaws.   Conservatives are luxuriating in their opponents' blunder.The case against Judge Ryskamp &quot;has been exposed as nothingbut innuendo and outright lies,&quot; declares Thomas Jipping ofCoalitions for America, a conservative lobby group. (Thejudge himself has declined to comment.)   Given the inherently malleable nature of such statisticalanalysis, especially when only three or four dozen cases arein question, the scuttling of the debate over percentagesshould allow the Senate to focus on Judge Ryskamp's treatmentof specific disputes and real people.   Few question the nominee's general competence. Beforebecoming a judge, he was an accomplished appellate lawyer. Amajority of the American Bar Association's judicialevaluation committee rated him &quot;well qualified,&quot; the panel'shighest grade. Even Elliot Mincberg, the legal analyst forPeople for the American Way, admits that in most areas, he&quot;isn't a bad judge.&quot;   But when civil rights are the issue, Judge Ryskamp tendsto say and do provocative things.   In one of several cases in which he reversed jury verdictsfor plaintiffs, Judge Ryskamp ruled in favor of the city ofWest Palm Beach, Fla., and its police chief after they weresued by black men who had been attacked by police dogs.Liberal activists have protested that the judge asserted inone court session that robbers get their hands lopped off insome countries and that &quot;it might not be inappropriate tocarry around a few scars to remind you of your wrongdoing inthe past.&quot; Judge Ryskamp's ruling was reversed by the sameappeals court he now aspires to join.   In a job discrimination case, the nominee expressed doubtthat an employer would find offensive a white employee's useof the term &quot;colored town&quot; to describe a minority community.&quot;I can't believe people are so thin-skinned that the termcolored town is going to be highly offensive,&quot; the judgesaid.   &quot;This goes beyond statistics,&quot; says Nan Aron, executivedirector of the liberal Alliance for Justice. &quot;It'soutrageous.&quot; Moreover, in his longtime membership in thepurportedly discriminatory Riviera Country Club in CoralGables, Fla., Judge Ryskamp &quot;has demonstrated anunconscionable indifference to bias,&quot; an Alliance for Justicereport charges.   Mr. Jipping insists that the nominee has been falselyaccused. In the police dog case, despite musing onpunishment-by-amputation, Judge Ryskamp reassured theplaintiffs that &quot;they do have civil rights.&quot; Mr. Jippingcontends that the judge didn't mean to say that theplaintiffs should have been scarred.   Despite the seemingly plain meaning of Judge Ryskamp'swords in the job discrimination case, Mr. Jipping suggests,the judge wasn't approving of the term &quot;colored town.&quot;Instead, says the conservative analyst, the nominee wasexpressing skepticism that the employer in question had foundthe term offensive enough to be the basis of firing theplaintiff.   As to Judge Ryskamp's membership in the Riviera club, thenominee is expected to say that if the club everdiscriminated it doesn't any longer.   In any event, the nominee's ability to defend his actions,statements and associations, rather than naked numbers, willnow properly receive the full attention of the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
