Dole's prediction was borne out moments later _ the final votewas four votes short of the margin that would be required to enactthe bill over a Bush veto.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole joined her husband in accusingDemocrats of picking a political fight with Bush instead ofaccepting the president's proposal and assuring nearly 4 millionminimum-wage workers a pay raise.   ``Congress just frittered away another, and the last chance toincrease the minimum wage this year,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``Thepresident will be forced to veto their unacceptable package andeveryone loses.''   Democrats pushing the measure vowed nonetheless to press theircase with the president and, while refusing to concede defeat inadvance, said they would advance another bill if Bush's first vetois sustained.   ``We want to make it very clear this fight is not going to goaway and we are going to continue the battle until we get a fairand justified increase in the minimum wage,'' Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass., said after the vote.   Moments later, Bush, who before the vote had said a veto was``going to be inevitable,'' made clear he meant it.   When the bill reaches the White House, Bush will veto it``instantly faster than the eye can see,'' presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said.   The president apparently won't get that chance until afterCongress returns from a 10-day recess that begins Friday.   The Democratic leadership does not want to send the bill to theWhite House immediately, which would allow Bush to veto it whilemost members of Congress are away from Washington. The delay alsowill allow time for what the Democrats hope will emerge _widespread public opposition to Bush's position.   The showdown over the minimum wage has been looming sinceCongress convened in January and has taken on symbolic significanceas the determinant in whether congressional Democrats or Bush willhold the upper hand in setting domestic policy.   Democrats have seemed as eager as Bush for the confrontation,but Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, insistedWednesday that the minimum wage was the wrong issue for that fight.   ``He really isn't standing up to Congress, he's standing on thenecks and backs of the working poor of this country,'' Mitchellsaid. ``The president has a perceived political need to look tough,to veto a bill. We hope the American people will persuade him thisis not the issue.''   The 63-37 Senate vote approved a plan to boost the hourlyminimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991. It alsowould allow employers to pay a subminimum wage to workers with lessthan 60 days total work experience.   Bush, following through on a campaign promise, had proposedraising the floor wage to $4.25 by January 1992 but only ifemployers could pay a subminimum to all new employees for sixmonths regardless of their prior work experience. The president hassaid that provision is necessary to offset potential job losses,but Democrats have assailed it as a means of allowing employers toavoid paying the higher minimum wage.   Even though it appears Bush will win the veto battle, justgetting a minimum-wage bill out of Congress was a symbolic victoryfor its sponsors, who for the past eight years could not move theirproposal even that far because of then-President Reagan's vehementopposition.</TEXT></DOC>
