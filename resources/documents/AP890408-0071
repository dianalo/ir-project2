SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Just a year from now, more than 100 millioncensus forms will cascade into American homes in the 21st nationalhead count. Most folks will find the questions familiar, but thereare some changes from the past.   The Constitution requires that the census be taken every yearending in a zero, and that the count then be used to decide howmany seats in the House of Representatives belong to each state.   Practically from the nation's beginning, however, the governmenthas asked for more information than just how many people there are.   The additional questions provide data used to assess whoAmericans are, their economic and social condition, and to helpdesign programs to deal with problems.   While some people complain that the requests for informationinvade their privacy, the Census Bureau refuses to ask things itconsiders too intrusive. For example, requests that it ask peopleabout their religion, sexual preference, pets or handedness, wereturned down.   The questions to be asked in 1990 were developed during a seriesof public hearings in all 50 states over several years. The plannedquestions were also submitted to Congress for review.   While printing of the 1990 census forms has only just gottenunderway, preliminary copies were obtained by The Associated Pressand American Demographics magazine, which specializes in populationissues.   Essentially there are two forms, short and long. The short formcontains seven population questions and seven housing questions,which officials want answered by every household in the country.Those questions are also the first part of the long form, whichwill go to 17 percent of households and asks for considerably moredetail.   American Demographics noted that a major change from 1980 willdistinguish between natural-born children and stepchildren in thisera of increasingly common divorce and remarriage.   New questions about pension will allow statisticians to get abetter idea about the economic well-being of the elderly, and forthe first time the agency will ask about condominium fees, secondmortgages and mobile homes.   Here is a question-by-question rundown on the 1990 censusshortform:   1. Name of each person living in the household.   2. How is this person related to the first person listed.
