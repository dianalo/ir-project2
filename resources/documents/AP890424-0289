MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Exxon Corp.'s first-quarter earnings fell 13percent, the company said Monday, as rising crude oil prices took abite out of refining margins and the Alaskan oil spill took a tollmostly on the company's image.   For the three months ended March 31, earnings at the nation'sbiggest oil company declined to $1.3 billion, or 99 cents a share,from $1.5 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the first quarter of lastyear. Revenue rose 1 percent to $22.2 billion compared with $22billion in the 1988 period.   Exxon, based in New York, said expenses grew fourfold from the1988 first quarter _ to $5.4 billion from $1.3 billion _ due mainlyto special one-time costs, including the acquisition of TexacoCanada Inc.   Exxon said the March 24 spill that tarnished the reputation ofthe nation's largest oil company had only a negligible financialimpact in the first period. Exxon said it charged $30 million for``salvage expense, vessel repair and partial loss of cargo.''   The huge Exxon Valdez oil tanker crashed into an underwater reefoff the Alaskan coast on March 24, spewing about 250,000 barrels ofoil into Prince William Sound.   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said the company doesn't yetknow the full cost of the disaster.   ``Exxon and Exxon Shipping Company carry insurance insubstantial amounts to deal with cleanups, damage claims andliabilities resulting from oil spills,'' the company said. ``Basedon information to date, we cannot reasonably estimate the netexpense to be borne by Exxon and Exxon Shipping Company.''   Rising world oil prices hurt Exxon's refining and marketingearnings but helped its exploration and production income in thefirst quarter, Rawl said.   ``Contrary to some public perceptions, prices for motor gasolineand other products did not increase as rapidly as crude oilcosts,'' the chairman said.   World crude prices have risen about $10 a barrel in the last sixmonths and although gasoline retail prices have jumped in recentweeks, analysts said they have not risen by a comparable amount pergallon.   ``That's the reason we're continuing to have a price rise inApril as they play catchup to crude,'' said Bruce Lazier, analystwith Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc.   Lazier said Exxon's earnings were good considering the cruderise.   Earnings from domestic exploration and production rose 22percent to $343 million, compared with $281 million in the 1988first period. Income from foreign exploration and production,however, slid 20 percent to $513 million from $642 million.   Refining profits, meanwhile, were down nearly 43 percent to $147million from $431 million in last year's first quarter.   Stephen Smith, an analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co., said heexpects a reversal in the second quarter as the rise in crudeprices is passed through to product prices, including gasoline.   ``At some point, gasoline will take over as demand increaseswith the driving season,'' Smith said.   Exxon said first-quarter results reflected a $3.9 billionexpense for the acquisition of Texaco Canada Inc. by its Canadiansubsidiary, Imperial Oil Ltd. Texaco Inc. sold its 78 percent stakein Texaco Canada in January.   Exxon also purchased more than 15 million shares of its ownstock at a cost of $676 million.</TEXT></DOC>
