A rod of molten steel is drawn froma bath by applying the vacuum to a vertical tube dipping into the moltenbath. An electrical coil surrounding the tube applies an intense magneticfield to the steel rod by passage of high frequency alternating currentthrough the coil. The rod is compressed radially inwardly by the magneticfield exposing the whole of the external surface of the rod to vacuum.At the same time, the induced eddy currents superheat the steel rod.The large surface area of application of vacuum, combined with the narrowdimension through which the gas must travel, ensure rapid and efficientremoval of the gases. The procedure is repeated until all the steel inthe bath has been treated. Lack of contact of the steel rod with thetube surface eliminates loss of heat by convection, and the superheatingof the steel rod by the eddy currents ensures that the overall heat lossesare minimal during processing of the molten metal bath.</TEXT></DOC>
