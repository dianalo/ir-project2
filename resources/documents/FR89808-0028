The rule will affect NHPRC applicantsand grantees.NARA also proposes in this rule to require applicants to submit a NARA-developedbudget form in place of Standard Form 424A, Budget Information_Non-ConstructionPrograms. The proposed collection of information requirements have beensubmitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct.

The Archivist of the United States awards grantsrecommended by the NHPRC. The publications program grants are made forthe preparation (compiling, edition and publishing) of printed and microfilmpublications. Subvention program grants are made to nonprofit presses tohelp support publication costs of sponsored editions. The records programgrants are made for the preservation, arrangement and description of historicalrecords. Education programs sponsored by NHPRC include an institute totrain scholars in documentary editing and fellowships in the fields ofdocumentary editing and archival administration. <ITAG tagnum="84">Collection of Information</ITAG>NARA is proposing that applicants for NHPRC grants submit a NARA-developedform, NA Form 17001, Budget Form, instead of the Standard Form 424A, BudgetInformation_Non-Construction Programs, used in many other Federal grantprograms. The form is completed once at the time of submission of the grantapplication. Use of the NARA form will allow NARA to evaluate competingapplications equitably.NARA estimates that approximately 200 NHPRC grant applicants each yearwould submit the form. The public reporting burden for this collectionof information is estimated to average 3 hours per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to NARA at the address indicated in the ADDRESSES sectionof the preamble and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for NARA, Washington,DC 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">Provisions of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>The proposed rule updates, clarifies and reorganizes the procedures governingthe operations of the programs of the NHPRC. Some of the procedures formerlycovered in 36 CFR part 1206 are now contained in 36 CFR parts 1207 and1209 which over the common rules governing uniform administrative proceduresand suspension and debarment procedures. In addition stylistic changeshave been made throughout. Following is a discussion of significant changesmade by the proposed rule. Definitions of ``State projects,'' ``regional projects,'' and ``nationalprojects'' have been added to andSection; 1206.2, and the definition of ``State''has been clarified. Section 1206.4 reflects two changes in NHPRC grant authority made by Pub.L. 100-365: Federal agencies are deleted and individuals added as a categoryof grantees. Reference to adivsory committees have been deleted in andSection;andSection;1206.14 and 1206.34. Authorization to appoint committees is given in 44U.S.C. 2505 and is superfluous in this Part. Section 1206.16 has been changed to include the provisions of publicationprojects of papers and documents as well as microform. Section 1206.18 has been rewritten and the amount of subvention has beenchanged from $10,000 to $12,000 per volume. In andSection; 1206.36, a procedure is added for designating and/or continuingthe term of the State historical records coordinator when the governorhas not made a timely appointment. A new andSection; 1206.37 is added toauthorize the designation of a deputy State historical records coordinatorto assist in carrying out the coordinator's responsibilities. Experience in administration of government records has been added to andSection;1206.38 in order to broaden State historical records advisory board membershipto include custodians of government records and government records managers.A reference is also added to establish procedures for continuation of Stateboard members' terms and other membership matters. Commission policy onappointment of state boards has changed in andSection; 1206.54. Governorsappoint board members with no requirement for NHPRC approval of nominations.Section 1206.56 has been modified to include the frequency with which theNHPRC meets to consider grant applications and to note that some Statehistorical advisory boards have established pre-submission review deadlinesfor proposals under the records program. Section 1206.58, ``How to apply,'' gives some specific NHPRC guidelinesto potential applicants for the publication and records programs. Theseinclude contact with NHPRC staff, application forms, assurances and certifications,and lists the program guideline pamphlets. Section 1206.66, ``Review and evaluation of grant proposals,'' is now dividedinto records grant proposals, publications grant proposals and subventiongrant applications. The new format allows each type of grant request tobe discussed in more specific terms. This rule is not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12291of February 17, 1981. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, itis hereby certified that this proposed rule will not have a significantimpact on small business entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 1206 </ITAG>Grant programs-Archives and records, Grant administration.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, NARA proposes to amend Part1206 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">PART 1206_NATIONAL HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS COMMISSION</ITAG>1.

The maximum possible cost sharing is encouragedin every proposal, and the level of cost sharing will be an important factorin the Commission's recommendation of most types of proposals.(c) <T3>Matching grants.</T3> An application for a matching grant should bemade when an applicant has prospects of securing financial support froma third party or, in the case of a State or local government agency, newfunds from the institution's own appropriation source are provided expresslyfor the project proposed in the application. Upon NARA approval of a matchinggrant request, the applicant shall present written documentation certifyingthat matching funds have been provided for the project by the non-Federalsource. In the case of a State or local government agency, the matchingrequirement may also be met through matching funds from the State or localgovernment provided that it can be demonstrated to the Commission's satisfactionthat the matching amount has been provided above and beyond funds previouslyallocated or planned for the agency's budget and that the funds are setaside exclusively to support the project proposed for an NHPRC grant. Applicantsneed not, however, have money in hand to make a matching grant request;they need only assure the Commission that they have reasonable prospectsof obtaining the needed amounts. Federal matching funds may be releasedonly after the proposal is recommended by the Commission and approved byNARA and after documentation has been submitted to the Commission demonstratingthat the matching funds have been obtained from the non-Federal source.(d) <T3>Combined grants.</T3> A combined grant comprises both outright fundsand matching funds. When the funds an applicant can raise plus the equivalentamount of an NHPRC grant do not equal the required budget, the differenceis requested in outright funds. For example, if the applicant needs $75,000and is able to raise $25,000 in gifts or in a new appropriation for theproject, a combined grant of $25,000 outright and $25,000 in matching fundsfor a total of $50,000 should be requested from the Commision.
