The ministry's general director of marketing, Tore Tonne, willmonitor the conference and hold bilateral talks withrepresentatives of some of the 12 or 13 countries expected toparticipate, said ministry spokesman Egil Helle.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'price-monitoring committee _ comprised of the oil ministers ofSaudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria and Indonesia _ decidedearlier this month to invite at least seven non-OPEC oil producersto meet for discussions on ways of cooperating to stabilize worldoil prices.   The conference is expected to consider joint cuts in oilproduction.   A spokesman at OPEC headquarters in Vienna, James Audu, saidWednesday that he had no information on which non-OPEC countrieshad agreed to attend the meeting, which begins next Tuesday. Hesaid Mexico, Egypt, China, Colombia, Angola, Malaysia, Brunei andOman had been invited.   Helle, the oil ministry spokesman, said Norway was not invitedto participate in the Vienna meeting, mainly because it made itclear to OPEC officials through informal contacts that it did notwant to attend.   Helle said Norway's policy was not to participate in formalagreements or multilateral talks with OPEC or other oil-producingnations but to assist in stabilizing oil markets by takingunilateral measures.   Helle said Norway nonetheless was pleased that the Viennameeting had been arranged.   ``We regard it as very positive that more exporting countriesoutside OPEC are showing a willingness to contribute to stabilizingoil prices,'' he said in a telephone interview.   Norway has been holding its oil production 7.5 percent belowcapacity since February 1987 as a unilateral measure designed tohelp OPEC support prices. Helle said Norway was not considering anyadditional measures.</TEXT></DOC>
