Koppers did not disclose the options it was studying, butinvestor Brian Beazer, who has joined with Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. in making the $45 a share, or $1.3 billion, takeover offer,criticized the company's disclosure.   Beazer said that if Koppers decided to undertake arecapitalization, the case the company essentially was bidding foritself. As such, Koppers was obligated to give Beazer's groupaccess to the same confidential corporate information Koppers woulduse to formulate such a plan.   ``You now have a duty to provide us with a `level playingfield,' to meet with us, and to furnish us with the sameinformation you would provide to potential lenders or investors inany recapitalization or asset sale program that Koppers isconsidering,'' Beazer said in a public letter issued Wednesday.   In addition to disclosing possible alternatives to thwartBeazer, Koppers likely will launch a publicity campaign criticizingShearson, according to one securities analyst.   ``I would expect the first thing you'll see ... will be somenewspaper advertising that'll peel the hide off Shearson,'' saidDonald A. Pattison of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. of New York.   Pattison said Shearson is vulnerable to criticism for owning 46percent of BNS Inc., the company formed with Beazer to attempt thetakeover of the Pittsburgh building materials and chemical company.   Shearson's equity participation is a more aggressive variationof investment bankers' traditional role as adviser and financier inhostile takeovers.   Koppers alleged in a federal lawsuit filed March 11 thatShearson violated disclosure requirements of securities laws andthat it offered to sell Koppers its services defending the companyagainst hostile takeovers after laying plans with Beazer to raidthe company.   Pittsburgh filed suit in federal court Wednesday alleging thatShearson, as underwriter of city bonds, violated its duty not to doanything to hurt the Pittsburgh economy, said David Welty,spokesman for Mayor Richard Caliguiri.   Under Beazer's plan to sell Koppers' chemical business, about1,100 jobs could disappear in Pittsburgh, city officials contend.   Caliguiri also ordered city department heads to exclude Shearsonfrom consideration as an underwriter of future financing, Weltysaid.   A Koppers spokesman said the board set no timetable for settlingdetails of any recapitalization offer.   ``The question is what's it worth'' to shareholders, saidsecurities analyst Gregory Drahuschak of Butcher andamp; Singer ofPittsburgh. ``Until that happens you wait around.   Pattison said he expects Koppers to defeat the tender offerthrough the lawsuit and an offer to common shareholders of cash andsecurities worth up to $60.   ``I don't see a third party out there that would be a competitorto Beazer,'' said Drahuschak. ``I tried to find one and couldn'teven scare up a good rumor.''   Pattison, however, said aggregates, the crushed stone used inroadbeds and mixed with cement to make concrete, are tightlycontrolled in Britain, enhancing interest in U.S. producers likeKoppers. The weak U.S. dollar and accounting rule differences inBritain and the United States might also attract other bidders forKoppers.   ``Koppers' board believes that the company remaining independentwould, over the long term, be a superior alternative to acceptingthe BNS offer,'' which is inadequate, the company said.   Koppers common stock jumped $2.75 a share Tuesday to $54.50 onthe New York Stock Exchange, apparently in anticipation ofWednesday's deadline for the company to respond to the tenderoffer. The announcement sent the stock down 87{ cents to $53.62{Wednesday in heavy trading.   Koppers Chairman Charles R. Pullin said management will explorethe possible sale of an equity interest in all or part of theconstruction materials and services business or portions of thebusiness and the proceeds used to sweeten the payments to commonshareholders.   Beazer has said it probably would sell Koppers' chemicalsbusiness if it gained control.   The BNS offer of $107 for each preferred share is adequate,Koppers said, while declining to advise holders whether to tendertheir stock.   Koppers said it is being advised by The First Boston Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
