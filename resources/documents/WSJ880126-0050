The plant, which employs 160 workers in Murfreesboro, a Nashville suburb, makes Toaster Strudel and Totino's brand pizza. Pizza production will be moved to another plant, but the company said the future of the strudel is uncertain. Designed to be heated in a toaster, the item never caught on as a breakfast mainstay.    A spokesman for the consumer foods and restaurant concern said 70 of 500 technicians, research scientists and engineers in the U.S. Foods group's Randamp;D area will be laid off. &quot;We've asked every function (in the group) to look at how it can operate more efficiently and competitively,&quot; he said.    Significant additional employee reductions are anticipated in other sectors as the company seeks to achieve a streamlining that, as previously reported, will result in $91 million in charges. </TEXT></DOC>
