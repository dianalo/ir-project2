The Department's reasons for using the proposed regulationare set forth below, followed by a discussion of the provisions of theproposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Background</ITAG>Section 406(a) of the Act generally prohibits a fiduciary\1\<NOTE/> with respect to an employee benefit plan from causing theplan to engage in certain types of transactions with a party in interest.\2\<NOTE/> Specifically, section 406(a)(1)(B) prohibits a fiduciarywith respect to a plan from causing the plan to engage in the direct orindirect lending of money or other extension of credit with a party ininterest. In addition, section 406(b) of the act generally prohibits afiduciary with respect to a plan from engaging in transactions in whichthe fiduciary has a conflict of interest. All of these prohibitions applyin the absence of either a statutory or administrative exemption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 3(21)(A) of the Act provides in part that a personis a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent: (i) He exercises anydiscretionary authority or discretionary control respecting managementof such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting managementor disposition of its assets; (ii) he renders investment advice for a feeor other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any monies orother property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility todo so; or (iii) he has any discretionary responsibility in the administrationof such plan.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The term ``party in interest'' is defined in section 3(14)of the Act to include persons providing services to the plan; employersany of whose employees are covered by the plan; an employee organizationany of whose members are covered by the plan; persons or other entitieshaving specified relationships with the plan; and employees, officers ordirectors of any of the foregoing. The term ``party in interest'' alsoincludes fiduciaries.One such statutory exemption is contained in section 408(b)(1) of the Act.Section 408(b)(1) states that the prohibitions contained in section 406of the act shall not apply to any loans made by a plan to parties in interestwho are participants and beneficiaries of the plan if such loans (A) areavailable to all such participants and beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalentbasis; (B) are not made available to highly compensated employees, officers,or shareholders in an amount greater than the amount made available toother employees; \3\<NOTE/> (C) are made in accordance with specific provisions regardingsuch loans set forth in the plan; (D) bear a reasonable rate of interest;and (E) are adequately secured. Congress indicated that it had adoptedthis provision ``[f]ollowing current practice'' under the Code precedingthe enactment of the Act. H.R. Rep. No. 1280, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 311(1974) [hereinafter Conf. Rpt.]<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Section 1114(b)(15)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub.L. 99-514) amends section 408(b)(1)(B) by deleting the phrase ``highlycompensated employees, officers, or shareholders'' and substituting thephrase ``highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)'' for years beginning after December31, 1988.Despite both the availability of information regarding the pre-ERISA statusof participant loans, and the specificity of the terms of section 408(b)(1)itself, the Department has received numerous requests for advisory opinionswhich have indicated uncertainty with respect to the scope of relief providedby section 408(b)(1) and the meaning of the terms used therein.\4\<NOTE/> Upon consideration of the degree of public interest in utilizingappropriately designed and administered participant loan programs, theDepartment has decided to propose a regulation under section 408(b)(1)to provide guidance to fiduciaries of employee benefit plans.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In response to most of these inquiries, the Departmenthas declined to issue the requested advisory opinions because the applicationspresented issues which were inherently factual in nature or which couldnot reasonably be resolved prior to the issuance of a regulation. Section5 of ERISA Procedure 76-1 (41 FR 36281, August 27, 1976) provides, amongother things, that the Department will generally not issue advisory opinionsunder such circumstances. See, <T3>e.g., </T3>letter to William G. Dallavo (No. F-1400) (November 28,1979); letter to James R. Fei (No. F-1496) (June 12, 1980); letter to ThomasR. Hoecher, Esq. (No. F-1767) (February 6, 1981, Washington Service BureauFile No. 91-027). The primary exception to this policy is Advisory Opinion81-12A (letter to Robert Georgine, January 15, 1981) regarding the ``reasonablerate of interest'' requirement in section 408(b)(1)(D) of the Act. Thisrequirement will be discussed, <T3>infra.</T3>Proposed regulation 29 CFR 2550.408b-1, discussed in detail below, addressesthe scope of the coverage of section 408(b)(1). If the proposed regulationis adopted, the Department will not regard transactions as coming withinthe term of section 408(b)(1) unless such transactions come within theterms of regulation andSection; 2550.408b-1. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Discussion of Proposed Regulation</ITAG>1.<T3> Scope.</T3> Proposed regulation andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(1) containsa general rule which is substantially identical to the terms of section408(b)(1) of the act. Thus, the proposed regulation states that the reliefprovided under section 408(b)(1) is available if loans made by a plan toparticipants and beneficiaries who are parties in interest with respectto the plan; (A) Are available to all such participants and beneficiarieson a reasonably equivalent basis; (B) are not made available to highlycompensated employees, officers, or shareholders in an amount greater thanthe amount made available to other employees; \5\<NOTE/> (C) are made in accordance with specific provisions regardingsuch loans set forth in the plan; (D) bear a reasonable rate of interest;and (E) are adequately secured.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See note 3, supra.The proposal indicates that, if these conditions are met, section 408(b)(1)will provide relief, with regard to the loans to participants, from theprohibitions of section 406(a) of the act (which prohibits a fiduciaryfrom causing a plan to engage in certain transactions with a party in interest),section 406(b)(1) of the act (which prohibits a fiduciary from dealingwith plan assets in his own interest or for his own account) and section406(b)(2) (which prohibits fiduciaries in their individual or in any othercapacity from acting in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of,or representing a party whose interests are adverse to those of the plan,its participants, or its beneficiaries). Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(2)states, however, that section 408(b)(1) does not provide relief from section406(b)(3) of the act (which prohibits fiduciaries from receiving considerationfor their own personal account from any party dealing with a plan in connectionwith a transaction involving plan assets).If adopted, proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(a) (1) and (2) would have severaleffects. By stating that section 408(b)(1) of the act contains relief fromthe prohibitions of sections 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2), a fiduciary who isalso a plan participant would be permitted to receive a loan under theparticipant loan program. In this regard, the Department notes that section408(b)(1) was designed to provide relief on a nondiscriminatory and equitablebasis to all plan participants who are parties in interest with respectto the plan.\6\<NOTE/> Section 3(14)(A) of the act includes fiduciaries within thedefinition of the term ``party in interest''. Nothing contained in section408(b)(1) or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended tolimit the availability of such loans because of a participant's fiduciarystatus. Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(3) recognizes such Congressionalintent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Department particularly notes that section 408(b)(1)(A),discussed in more detail,<T3> infra,</T3> provides that loans must be made available to ``<T3>all</T3> such participants and beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalentbasis.'' (Emphasis added.)<T3> See also</T3> Senate Comm. on Finance, Private Pension Plan Reform,S. Rep. No. 383, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 98 (1973),<T3> reprinted in</T3> Subcomm. on Labor, Senate Comm. on Labor and Pub.Welfare, Legislative History of the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct of 1974, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 1166 (Comm. Print 1976).The exemption under section 408(b)(1) includes within its coverage certaintransactions in which the potential for self-dealing by fiduciaries existsand in which the interests of fiduciaries may conflict with the interestsof participants. To guard against potential abuses, the Department willsubject these transactions to special scrutiny to ensure that the conditionsof section 408(b)(1) have been met in connection with a fiduciary receivinga loan under a participant loan program. The regulations, and accompanyingexamples, make it clear that a fiduciary may only receive a loan from aplan if: (1) The program is administered under strict objective criteriawhich assure the equitable availability of the assets committed to theprogram among qualified participants, and (2) the borrowing fiduciary doesnot receive more favorable consideration or terms than other plan participantsrequesting a loan.In the event of default upon an exempt loan by a plan fiduciary, the Departmentexpects that appropriate action will be taken in accordance with the strictobjective criteria developed under the loan program to assure the preservationof plan assets.Fiduciaries are cautioned to scrupulously exercise their discretion inapproving loans to themselves or other fiduciaries and should be preparedto demonstrate that the borrowing fiduciary received the same considerationor terms as other plan participants seeking a loan. In order to avoid potentialconflicts of interest and appearances of impropriety, the Department stronglyencourages those programs under which loans to fiduciaries are grantedand administered by fiduciaries or loan committees who are independentof the borrowing fiduciary.Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(3) further provides that a loan willnot be exempt under section 408(b)(1) unless it is arranged and approvedby the fiduciary administering the loan program primarily in the interestof the participants and othewise satisfies the conditions set forth insection 408(b)(1) of the act. In the Department's view, Congress did notintend to sanction a participant loan program that was established andoperated for the benefit of parties in interest other than participantsand their beneficiaries. Thus, no relief would be available under section408(b)(1) for a loan program which in form or in operation limits loansto those participants who agree or acknowledge to the fiduciary administeringthe program that their loan proceeds will be used in furtherance of anemployer's or other party in interest's business enterprise. Similarly,consideration by a plan fiduciary of factors which are not related to themerits of the loan as an investment, such as a potential borrower's prioragreement with the fiduciary to reloan the proceeds to a party in interest,would also fail to comply with the proposed regulations. In this regard,a participant loan program will not fall outside the scope of the regulationsmerely because the program, by its express terms, limits loans to certainstated purposes, e.g. hardship, medical or college education, which arenot inconsistent with the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries.    Moreover, a participant loan program which limits the availability of loansto those participants who agree to apply the loan proceeds for the benefitof other parties in interest, such as the employer, calls into questionwhether loans made under such program satisfy the exclusive purpose requirementsof section 403(c) and 404(a) of the Act.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Section 403(c) provides, in part, that the assets of aplan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be heldfor the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in theplan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administeringthe plan. Section 404(a) requires, among other things, that a fiduciarydischarge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of planparticipants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providingbenefits to participants and their beneficiaries. Conversely, in the absence of any inappropriate precondition or other factsand circumstances indicating that the loan program is not administeredprimarily for the benefit of participants, the proposed regulation containsno restrictions on the uses that plan participants may make of the borrowedmoney. Nothing in this regulation should be interpreted as limiting thesubsequent use by the borrowing plan participant of the proceeds of a bonafide loan. In the Department's view, the subsequent use by or transferto non-participant parties in interest at the unfettered discretion ofthe borrower is destinguishable from a precondition established by thefudiciaries administering the loan program which requires the plan participantto use the loan proceeds to benefit a party in interest. In addition, under the proposal, no relief will be available for transactionswhich, although formally executed as loans, are made with the understandingthat the borrower has no intention to repay. Such a transaction would notconstitute a participant loan, but merely a transfer of plan assets toor for the benefit of a party in interest in violation of section 406(a)(1)(D)of the act. All the surrounding facts and circumstances will be consideredin determining whether a loan satisfies the requirements under the proposal.Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(4) contains examples designed to illustratethese requirements. Similarly, the Department recognizes that fiduciaries may find it necessaryon occasion to dispose of property securing a participant loan in the eventof default on the loan. Under those circumstances, the Department believesthat the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) encompasses the sale, foreclosureor other disposal of the plan's security interest to satisfy a participant'soutstanding obligation in the event of default. However, section 408(b)(1)does not provide an exemption for the sale or other disposal of the plan'ssecurity interest to a party in interest in the event of default. The Departmentfurther cautions that, in circumstances other than default, the transferof property by a party in interest in repayment of a participant loan willbe viewed as a prohibited sale or exchange of property between a plan anda party in interest under section 406 of the act. 2. <T3>Reasonably Equivalent Basis. </T3>Section 408(b)(1)(A) of the act statesthat the relief contained in section 408(b)(1) applies only if the loansare available on a reasonably equivalent basis to all participants andbeneficiaries who are parties in interest with respect to the plan. Proposedregulation andSection; 2550.408b-1(b) is designed to explain this provision.In accordance with applicable legislative history, the proposal first indicatesthat such loans must be made available to all plan participants and beneficiarieswithout regard to an individual's race, color, religion, age, sex or nationalorigin.\8\<NOTE/> Further, the proposal would require that, in making a loan,the plan may consider only those factors which would be considered in anormal commercial setting by an entity in the business of making similarloans. Such factors could include, among others, the applicant's creditworthinessor financial need.\9\<NOTE/> Both the form and operation of the participant loan programwill determine whether loans are actually made on a reasonably equivalentbasis. Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(b)(2) contains examples designedto illustrate these considerations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 120 CONG. REC. 4726 (Feb. 28, 1974) <T3>as reprinted in </T3>Subcomm. on Labor, U.S. Senate Comm. on Laborand Pub. Welfare, 94th CONG., 2d SESS., Legislative History of the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 3518 (Remarks of Rep. Abzug andRep. Dent) Comm. Print 1976); Conf.

Rpt., <T3>supra, </T3>at 311. 3. <T3>Highly Compensated Employees. </T3>Section 408(b)(1)(B) states thatthe relief provided in section 408(b)(1) is available only if participantloans are not made available to highly compensated employees, officers,or shareholders in an amount greater than the amount made available toother employees. With regard to this provision, Congress stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The conferees intend that this will allow a plan to lend the samepercentage of a person's vested benefits to participants with both largeand small amounts of accrued vested benefits. (However, the percentageis to be consistent with the requirements of adequate security.) The confereesalso intend that a plan may provide that the same dollar amounts may beloaned to participants and beneficiaries without regard to the amount oftheir vested benefits if adequate security is otherwise provided. For example,a plan could provide for loans to participants and beneficiaries in anamount up to, e.g., $30,000 to buy a house (even if the $30,000 is greaterthan the amount of the participant's or beneficiary's vested benefits)if the loan is adequately secured by, e.g., a first mortgage on the house.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Conf. Rpt., <T3>supra,</T3> at 312. In light of this, proposed regulation andSection;2550.408b-1(c)(2) states that a participant loan program will not failto meet this requirement if the plan documents specifically governing theparticipant loan program set forth either: (1) A maximum dollar limitation,or (2) a maximum percentage of vested accrued benefit which no loan mayexceed. Section 2550.408b-1(c)(3) of the proposal goes on to state thatif the second alternative (maximum percentage of vested accrued benefit)is chosen, a loan program will not fail to meet this requirement solelybecause maximum loan amounts will vary directly with the size of the participant'svested accrued benefit.\1\\0\<NOTE/> However, no loan program will satisfy this requirement ifthe program operates to exclude large numbers of plan participants fromreceiving loans.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Proposed section 2550.408-1(c)(4) contains examples of theapplication of these provisions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The Department notes that the Tax Equity and FiscalResponsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (Pub. L. 97-428) places a number ofrestrictions on participant loans for certain tax purposes. In addition,the Department notes that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514) placesfurther restrictions on participant loans. For example, section 236 ofTEFRA and section 1134 of the Tax Reform Act amend section 72 of the Codeto state that a participant loan will be treated as a distribution underthe plan unless such loan does not exceed the lesser of: (i) $50,000 (whichamount must be reduced by the outstanding balances for any previous participantloans from the plan in accordance with section 72(p)(2)(A)); or (ii) one-halfof the present value of the nonforfeitable accrued benefit of the employeeunder the plan (but not less than $10,000). In the Department's view, aparticipant loan program administered pursuant to plan provisions whichhave been amended to preclude the making of loans which would be considereddistributions under section 72(p) of the Code will not fail to satisfythe condition in section 408(b)(1)(B) of the Act and proposed andSection;2550.408-1(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ The Department notes the amendment to section 408(b)(1)(B)contained in section 1114(b)(15)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, discussedin note 3, supra. In the Department's view, this amendment merely clarifiesthe categories of persons in whose favor a loan program may not discriminatewhile not affecting the requirement contained in section 408(b)(1)(B) thata loan program must be operated in a nondiscriminatory manner so as notto exclude large numbers of plan participants. Accordingly, the Departmenthas decided not to propose a special effective date for proposed andSection;2550.408b-1(c).4. <T3>Specific Plan Provisions.</T3> Section 408(b)(1)(C) of the Act statesthat the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) will be available only forloans made in accordance with specific provisions regarding such loansset forth in the plan. In the Department's view, this requirement seeksto assure that the safeguards otherwise afforded by section 408(b)(1) tothe plan and those participants seeking loans are not compromised by informalarrangements which could serve as a basis for improper discrimination orarbitrarily determined terms. The Department believes that a formal decisionmakingprocess based on detailed loan provisions contained in the plan or in awritten document forming part of the plan is necessary to accomplish thisunderlying purpose. However, the Department is aware that participant loan programs may alreadybe operating pursuant to a variety of provisions in plan documents. TheDepartment does not intend to call into question the validity of such programswhere the plan provisions governing participant loans are reasonably calculatedto apprise potential borrowers of the existence and scope of the loan program.As a result, proposed regulation andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(1) states that,in the case of a participant loan granted or renewed at any time priorto the last day of the first plan year beginning on or after January 1,1989, the Department will consider the loans are made in accordance withspecific provisions regarding such loans set forth in the plan if the plancontains an explicit authorization for the establishment of a participantloan program. In the case of a participant loan granted or renewed on or after the lastday of the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1989, proposedregulation andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2) states that the participant loansmust be governed by provisions in the plan or in a written document formingpart of the plan which include, but need not be limited to: (1) The identityof the person or position authorized to administer the participant loanprogram; (2) a procedure for applying for loans; (3) the basis on whichloans will be approved or denied; (4) limitations (if any) on the typesand amounts of loans offered; (5) the procedure under the program for determininga reasonable rate of interest; (6) the types of collateral which may securea participant loan; and (7) the events constituting default and the stepsthat will be taken to preserve plan assets in the event of such default.The Department does not intend this to be an exhaustive list. Rather, theprovisions in the plan documents should be sufficiently complete so asto apprise all possible borrowers of the scope and procedures of the loanprogram. If the plan fails either to contain such specific provisions orto administer participant loans in accordance with a written program, loansmade under such a program will fail to qualify for the refief extendedin section 408(b)(1). In this regard, the Department intends that loansto fiduciaries will be administered in accordance with objective criteriadeveloped in conjunction with a written participant loan program. 5. <T3>Reasonable Rate of Interest. </T3>Section 408(b)(1)(D) of the Act statesthat, in order for a loan to be covered by the relief provided by section408(b)(1), such loan must bear a reasonable rate of interest. Since itis the view of the Department that a participant loan is a plan investment,the Department believes this statutory exemption contemplates that loansinvolving parties in interest, which otherwise would be prohibited underERISA, would be permitted only if plans receive the rate of interest thatprofessional lenders exercising sound investment practices would chargeon similar arms-length loans. Thus, under proposed regulation andSection;2550.408b-1(e), a ``reasonable rate of interest'' is one which providesthe plan with a return commensurate with the prevailing interest rate chargedby persons in the business of lending money for loans which would be madeunder similar circumstances. This objective prevailing rate standard wasdescribed in Advisory Opinion 81-12A, <T3>supra, </T3>after an examination of the relevant legislative historyand the practice under the Code prior to enactment of ERISA. In that letter,the Department stated that the prevailing rate standard permits a fiduciaryto consider those factors pertaining to the opportunity for gain and therisk of loss that professional lenders would consider in setting the rateof interest on a similar arm's-length loan.\12\<NOTE/> The prevailing rate, of course may vary with the creditworthinessof the borrower and the security given for the loan. Moreover, the prevailingrate will ordinarily represent a narrow range of rates offered by similarlysituated lenders making similar loans in the marketplace. Although theDepartment views the prevailing rate concept as a flexible standard, theadvisory opinion emphasizes that a participant loan or program of loans,as a plan investment, would not be prudent if the investment provided aplan with less return, relative to risk, than comparable investments availableto the plan, or if it involved a greater risk to the security of plan assetsthan other investments offering a similar return.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The Department acknowledges that the approach taken inA. O. 81-12A was not adopted by the court in <T3>Brock v. Walton, </T3>No. 85-5641 (11th Cir., July 21, 1986). Loansunder the participant loan program in <T3>Walton </T3>were made on the average at interest rates 2\1/8\ perentagepoints lower than prevailing rates in the community. Loans made on theseterms, however, provided the plan with returns higher than those of otherplan assets and in excess of the plan's actuarial and funding requirements.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Department contended that by making below prevailing rate loans,the trustees had violated the fiduciary duty provisions of section 404(a)(1)(A) and (B). Further, the Department argued that loans made below the prevailingrate would fail to bear a reasonable rate of interest and would thereforebe ineligible for the statutory exemption provided in section 408(b)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">In rejecting the Department's position, the court in </ITAG><T3>Walton </T3>held the interest rate differential was not alone sufficientto show that the trustees had acted imprudently, or that the loans failedto bear a reasonable rate of interest. However, the court did state thatthere could be cases in which the rate of interest could depart so farfrom the prevailing rate that a loan could not be justified as prudentor in the best interest of plan participants.<ITAG tagnum="28">After a careful review of the court's opinion, it continues to bethe Department's position that the law of trusts establishes an objectivestandard of fiduciary conduct which has been incorporated by Congress inERISA and applied in numerous cases thereunder. </ITAG><T3>See, e.g., Donovan v. Cunningham, </T3>716 F.2d 1455, 1467-68 (5thCir. 1983), <T3>cert. denied </T3>104 S. Ct. 3533 (1984); <T3>Donovan v. Mazzola, </T3>716 F.2d 1226, 1231-32 (9th Cir. 1983), <T3>cert. denied </T3>464 U.S. 1040 (1984); <T3>Freund v. Marshall andamp; Ilsley Bank, </T3>485 F. Supp. 629, 635 (W.D.Wisc. 1979). Further, the legislative history clearly indicates that Congressprovided an exemption from the prohibited transaction rules for participantloans in section 408(b)(1) ``following current practice.'' Conf. Rpt.,<T3>supra, </T3>at 311. In discussing the state of the law prior to thepassage ERISA, Congress noted:<ITAG tagnum="28">Under the Internal Revenue Code, qualified retirement plans must befor the exclusive benefit of the employees and their beneficiaries. Followingthis requirement, the Internal Revenue Service has developed general rulesthat govern the investment of plan assets, including a requirement thatcost must not exceed fair market value at the time of purchase, </ITAG><T3>there must be a fair return commensurate with the prevailing rate,</T3>sufficient liquidity must be maintained to permit distributions, andthe safeguards and diversity that a prudent investor would adhere to mustbe present.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>Id. </T3>302. [Emphasis added.] <T3>See </T3>26 U.S.C. 503(b)(1) [1970], Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.503(b)-1(c)[1960].<ITAG tagnum="28">In view of this, the Department believes there is sufficient basisto conclude that both sections 404 and 408(b)(1) require participant loansto provide the plan with a fair return commensurate with the prevailingrate. As a result, the Department has determined to include its longstandinginterpretation of the reasonable rate of interest standard in section 408(b)(1)(D)in this proposal.</ITAG>While the Department believes, as stated above, that the prevailing ratestandard is the appropriate interpretation of the ``reasonable rate ofinterest'' requirement of section 408(b)(1)(D), it also believes that suchan interpretation is also necessary to further the primary policy objectiveof ERISA_to protect and enhance the retirement income of participants andbeneficiaries. Accordingly, the Department views a participant loan asan investment subject to the same standards of ERISA as any other investment,<T3>e.g., </T3>the prudence and exclusive benefit rules. Thus, where aplan is acting, in effect, as a lender, there is no rationale under ERISAfor permitting the plan to assume a risk at a lesser return than the returnthat market forces would have set for assuming such a risk.The prevailing rate standard is also supported by another strong policyconsideration. By defining ``reasonable rate'' as the ``prevailing rate'',the regulation is also consistent with the Department's objective of providingguidance to plan fiduciaries that will facilitate the establishment andoperation of participant loan programs.Proposed regulation andSection; 2550.408b-1(e) contains examples of the applicationof these provisions.6. <T3>Adequate Security. </T3>Section 408(b)(1)(E) of the Act states thatthe relief provided by section 408(b)(1)( will apply only to loans thatare adequately secured. Prior to the enactment of ERISA, section 503(a)of the Code provided that certain organizations would lose their tax exemptstatus if they engaged in a prohibited transaction. Section 503(b) of theCode listed as one such prohibited transaction certain loans made withoutreceipt of adequate security or a reasonable rate of interest. Pursuantto this requirement, the Internal Revenue Service adopted regulation 26CFR 1.503b-1(b)(1) to define the term ``adequate security''. The Departmentproposes to adopt a similar approach in proposed regulation 2550.408b-1(f),which states that a loan will be considered to be adequately secured ifthe security posted for such loan is something in addition to and supportinga promise to pay, which is so pledged to the plan that it may be sold,foreclosed upon, or otherwise disposed of in default of the loan, the valueand liquidity of which security is such that it may be anticipated thatloss of principal or interest will not result from the loan. To the extentthat there are restrictions under applicable Code provisions against reductionor disposal of a participant's vested accrued benefit to satisfy a participant'soutstanding obligation in the event of a default, such security may notbe adequate for purposes of section 408(b)(1)(E) of the act. Under suchcircumstances, additonal security must be pledged.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ In this regard, the Department notes that participantloans are generally subject to the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (Pub.L. 98-397). Specifically, a reduction in an accrued benefit to satisfya participant's loan obligation to the plan is treated as a distributionfrom the plan and is generally subject to the applicable consent requirementof ERISA section 205 and Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417(e) (see 26 CFR1.417(e)-1T(d)). If the plan does not obtain the required consent priorto the making a loan secured by the participant's accrued benefit, theplan may not be able to execute on the security by reducing the participant'saccrued benefit without violating Code section 417(e). Thus, under theabove circumstances, the plan may have made a loan that is not adequatelysecured within the meaning of this proposed regulation.The proposal also states that a determination as to the adequacy of securitywill be made in light of the type and amount of security which would berequired in the case of a comparable transaction in a normal commercial(arm's-length) setting between unrelated parties.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 Statement</ITAG>The final rule in this document is not classified as a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291 on Federal Regulations, because it is not likelyto result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers; individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The action will impose some costs on employee benefit plans. These costshave been estimated to be one-time costs of just under $18 million andsubsequent annual costs of less than $150,000.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement</ITAG>The Department does not believe that this regulation would have a significanteconomic effect on small plans. In conducting the analysis required underthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, it was estimated that the one-timecost to each pension plan of implementing the regulation would be approximately$100. The only burden attributable to this regulation is the one-time burdenof amending the plan documents to include the specific plan provisionsdescribing the participant loan program which are required by the regulationand amending the summary plan description in order to apprise participantsof the required provisions. Further, it should be noted that the Tax ReformAct of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-154) requires that plan amendments be made generallywithin the same time frame as that proposed in these regulations. Thisregulation would not increase reporting requirements for private pensionplans, and would not affect competition wihin any particular industry.The number of small entities estimated to be affected by this regulationis substantial. An estimated 163,000 small plans may have to be amendedto incorporate the specific plan provisions required by these regulations.Annually, the number of new loan programs instituted by small plans thatwill require specific provisions to be included in the plan is estimatedto be 8,000. The Department chose not to make any distinction between requirements forsmall and large plans. The requirements imposed by ERISA and this regulationare designed to insure that participant loan programs are administeredfairly and do not favor those individuals who have control over the plans.There are no characteristics of small plans that would make their loanprograms less susceptible to abuse than loan programs of large plans. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>Section 2550.408b-1(d) of the proposed regulation contains a paperworkrequirement.

Effective, December 31, 1978, section102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978)transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgateregulations of the type proposed herein to the Secretary of Labor. Therefore,all references herein to section 408(b)(1) of the Act should be read toinclude reference to the parallel provisions of section 4975(d)(1) of theCode. (2) <T3>Scope. </T3>Section 408(b)(1) of the Act does not contain an exemptionfrom acts described in section 406(b)(3) of the Act (prohibiting fiduciariesfrom receiving consideration for their own personal account from any partydealing with a plan in connection with a transaction involving plan assets).If a loan from a plan to a participant who is a party in interest withrespect to that plan involves an act described in section 406(b)(3), suchan act constitutes a separate transaction which is not exempt under section408(b)(1) of the Act. The provisions of section 408(b)(1) are further limitedby section 408(d) of the Act (relating to transactions with owner-employeesand related persons). (3) <T3>Loans. </T3>(i) Section 408(b)(1) of the Act provides relief from theprohibitions of section 406(a), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) for the makingof a participant loan. The term ``participant loan'' refers to a loan whichis arranged and approved by the fiduciary administering the loan programprimarily in the interest of the participant and which otherwise satisfiesthe criteria set forth in section 408(b)(1) of the Act. The existence ofa participant loan or participant loan program will be determined uponconsideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. Thus, for example,the mere presence of a loan document appearing to satisfy the requirementsof section 408(b)(1) will not be dispositive of whether a participant loanexists where the subsequent administration of the loan indicates that theparties to the loan agreement did not intend the loan to be repaid. Moreover,a loan program containing a precondition designed to benefit a party ininterest (other than the participant) is not afforded relief by section408(b)(1) or this regulation. In this regard, section 408(b)(1) recognizesthat a program of participant loans, like other plan investments, mustbe prudently established and administered for the exclusive purpose ofproviding benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the plan. (ii) For the purpose of this regulation, the term ``loan'' will includeany renewal or modification of an existing loan agreement, provided that,at the time of each such renewal or modification, the requirements of section408(b)(1) and this regulation are met. (4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the provisions of<T3> 2550.408b-1(a).</T3><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>T, a trustee of plan P, has exclusive discretionover the management and disposition of plan assets. As a result, T is afiduciary with respect to P under section 3(21)(A) of the Act and a partyin interest with respect to P pursuant to section 3(14)(A) of the Act.T is also a participant in P. Among T's duties as fiduciary is the administrationof a participant loan program which meets the requirements of section 408(b)(1)of the Act. Pursuant to strict objective criteria stated under the program,T, who participates in all loan decisions, receives a loan on the sameterms as other participants. Although the exercise of T's discretion onbehalf of himself may constitute an act of self-dealing described in section406(b)(1), section 408(b)(1) provides an exemption from section 406(b)(1).As a result, the loan from P to T would be exempt under section 408(b)(1),provided the conditions of that section are otherwise satisfied. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>P is a plan covering all the employees of E, theemployer who established and maintained P. F is a fiduciary with respectto P and an officer of E. The plan documents governing P give F the authorityto establish a participant loan program in accordance with section 408(b)(1)of the Act. Pursuant to an arrangement with E, F establishes such a programbut limits the use of loan funds to investments in a limited partnershipwhich is established and maintained by E as general partner. Under thesefacts, the loan program and any loans made pursuant to this program areoutside the scope of relief provided by section 408(b)(1) because the loanprogram is designed to operate for the benefit of E. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Assume the same facts as in Example 2, above, exceptthat F does not limit the use of loan funds. However, E pressures his employeesto borrow funds under P's participant loan program and then reloan theloan proceeds to E. F, unaware of E's activities, arranges and approvesthe loans. If the loans meet all the conditions of section 408(b)(1), suchloans will be exempt under that section. However, E's activities wouldcause the entire transaction to be viewed as an indirect transfer of planassets between P and E, who is a party in interest with respect to P, butnot the participant borrowing from P. By coercing the employees to engagein loan transactions for its benefit, E, has engaged in separate transactionsthat are not exempt under section 408(b)(1). Accordingly, E would be liablefor the payment of excise taxes under section 4975 of the Code. Under thecircumstances described, the diversion of plan assets for E's benefit wouldalso violate sections 403(c)(1) and 404(a) of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Assume the same facts as in Example 2, above, exceptthat, in return for structuring and administering the loan program as indicated,E, agrees to pay F an amount (in addition to F's normal fiduciary fee)equal to 10 percent of the funds loaned under the program. Such a paymentwould result in a separate transaction not covered by section 408(b)(1).This transaction would be prohibited under section 406(b)(3) since F wouldbe receiving consideration from a party in connection with a transactioninvolving plan assets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>F is a fiduciary with respect to plan P. D is a partyin interest with respect to plan P. Section 406(a)(1)(B) of the act wouldprohibit F from causing P to lend money to D. However, F enters into anagreement with Z, a plan participant, whereby F will cause P to make aparticipant loan to Z with the express understanding that Z will subsequentlylend the loan proceeds to D. An examination of Z's credit standing indicatesthat he is not credit worthy and would not, under normal circumstances,receive a loan under the conditions established by the participant program.F's decision to approve the participant loan to Z on the basis of Z's prioragreement to lend the money to D violates the exclusive purpose requirementsof sections 403(c) and 404(a). In effect, the entire transaction is viewedas an indirect transfer of plan assets between P and D, and not a loanto a participant exempt under section 408(b)(1). Z's lack of credit standingwould also cause the transaction to fail under section 408(b)(1)(A) ofthe act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>F is fiduciary with respect to Plan P. Z is a planparticipant. Z and D are both parties in interest with respect to P. Fapproves a participant loan to Z in accordance with the conditions establishedunder the participant loan program. Upon receipt of the loan, Z intendsto lend the money to D. If F has approved this loan solely upon considerationof those factors which would be considered in a normal commercial settingby an entity in the business of making comparable loans, Z's subsequentuse of the loan proceeds will not affect the determination of whether loansunder P's program satisfy the conditions of section 408(b)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (7). </T3>A is the trustee of a small individual account plan.D, the president of the plan sponsor, is also a participant in the plan.Pursuant to a participant loan program meeting the requirements of section408(b)(1), D applies for a loan to be secured by a parcel of real property.D does not intend to repay the loan; rather, upon eventual default, hewill permit the property to be foreclosed upon and transferred to the planin discharge of his legal obligation to repay the loan. A, aware of D'sintention, approves the loan. D fails to make two consecutive quarterlypayments of principal and interest under the note evidencing the loan therebyplacing the loan in default. The plan then acquires the real property uponforeclosure. Such facts and circumstances indicate that the payment ofmoney from the plan to D was not a participant loan eligible for the reliefafforded by section 408(b)(1). In effect, this transaction is a prohibitedsale or exchange of property between a plan and a party in interest fromthe time D receives the money.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (8).</T3> Plan P establishes a participant loan program. Allloans are subject to the condition that the borrowed funds must be usedto finance home purchases. Interest rates on the loans are the same asthose charged by a local savings and loan association under similar circumstances.A loan by P to a participant to finance a home purchase would be subjectto the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) provided that the conditionsof 408(b)(1) are met. A participant loan program which is established tomake loans for certain stated purposes (e.g., hardship, college tuition,home purchases, etc.) but which is not otherwise designed to benefit partiesin interest (other than plan participants) would not, in itself, causesuch program to be ineligible for the relief provided by section 408(b)(1).However, fiduciaries are cautioned that operation of a loan program withlimitations may result in loans not being made available to all participantsand beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalent basis.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Reasonably Equivalent Basis.</T3> (1) Loans will not be consideredto have been made available to participants and beneficiaries on a reasonablyequivalent basis unless:(i) Such loans are available to all plan participants and beneficiarieswithout regard to any individual's race, color, religion, sex, age or nationalorigin;(ii) In making such loans, consideration has been given only to those factorswhich would be considered in a normal commercial setting by an entity inthe business of making similar types of loans. Such factors may includethe applicant's creditworthiness and financial need; and(iii) An evaluation of all relevent facts and circumstances indicates that,in actual practice, loans are not unreasonably withheld from any applicant.(2) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the provisions ofandSection; 2550.408b-1(b)(1):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>T, a trustee of plan P, has exclusive discretionover the management and disposition of plan assets. T's duties includethe administration of a participant loan program which meets the requirementsof section 408(b)(1) of the Act. T receives a participant loan at a lowerinterest rate than the rate made available to other plan participants ofsimilar financial condition or creditworthiness. The loan by P to T wouldnot be covered by the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) because loansunder P's program are not available to all plan participants on a reasonablyequivalent basis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Same facts as in example 1, except that T is a memberof a committee of trustees responsible for approving participant loans.T pressures the committee to refuse loans to other qualified participantsin order to assure that the assets allocated to the participant loan programwould be available for a loan by P to T. The loan by P to T would not becovered by the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) since participant loanshave not been made available to all participants and beneficiaries on areasonably equivalent basis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>T is the trustee of plan P, which covers the employeesof E. A, B and C are employees of E, participants in P, and friends ofT. The documents governing P provide that T, in his discretion, may establisha participant loan program meeting certain specified criteria. T institutessuch a program and tells A, B, and C of his decision. Before T is ableto notify P's other participants and beneficiaries of the loan program,A, B, and C file loan applications which, if approved, will use up substantiallyall of the funds set aside for the loan program. Approval of these applicationsby T would represent facts and circumstances showing that loans under P'sprogram are not available to all participants and beneficiaries on a reasonablyequivalent basis.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Highly Compensated Employees. </T3>(1) Loans will not be consideredto be made available to highly compensated employees, officers or shareholdersin an amount greater than the amount made available to other employeesif, upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the programdoes not operate to exclude large numbers of plan participants from receivingloans under the program.(2) A participant loan program will not fail to meet the requirement inparagraph (1), above, merely because the plan documents specifically governingsuch loans set forth either: (i) A maximum dollar limitation, or (ii) amaximum percentage of vested accrued benefit which no loan may exceed.(3) If the second alternative in paragraph (2) above (maximum percentageof vested accrued benefit) is chosen, a loan program will not fail to meetthis requirement solely because maximum loan amounts will vary directlywith the size of the participant's accrued benefit.(4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the provisions ofandSection; 2550.408b-1(c).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>The documents governing plan P provide for the establishmentof a participant loan program in which the amount of any loan under theprogram (when added to the outstanding balances of any other loans underthe program to the same participant) does not exceed the lesser of (i)$50,000, or (ii) one-half of the present value of that participant's vestedaccrued benefit under the plan (but not less than $10,000). P's participantloan program does not fail to meet the requirement in section 408(b)(1)of the Act, provided the other conditions of that section are met.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>The documents governing plan T provide for the establishmentof a participant loan program in which the minimum loan amount would be$25,000. The documents also require that the only security acceptable underthe program would be the participant's vested accrued benefit. A, the planfiduciary administering the loan program, finds that because of the restrictionsin the plan documents only 20 percent of the plan participants, all ofwhom earn in excess of $75,000 a year, would meet the threshold qualificationsfor a loan. Most of these participants are high-level supervisors or corporateofficers. Based on these facts, it appears that loans under the programwould be made available to highly compensated employees in an amount greaterthan the amount made available to other employees. As a result, the loanprogram would fail to meet the requirement in section 408(b)(1)(B) of theAct and would not be covered by the relief provided in section 408(b)(1).</ITAG>(d) <T3>Specific Plan Provisions. </T3>For the purposes of section 408(b)(1)and this regulation, the Department will consider that participant loansgranted or renewed at any time prior to the last day of the first planyear beginning on or after January 1, 1989, are made in accordance withspecific provisions regarding such loans set forth in the plan if:(1) The plan provisions regarding such loans contain (at a minimum) anexplicit authorization for the plan fiduciary responsible for investingplan assets to establish a participant loan program; and(2) For participant loans granted or renewed on or after the last day ofthe first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1989, the participantloan program which is contained in the plan or in a written document formingpart of the plan includes, but need not be limited to, the following:(i) The identity of the person or positions authorized to administer theparticipant loan program;(ii) A procedure for applying for loans;(iii) the basis on which loans will be approved or denied;(iv) Limitations (if any) on the types and amounts of loans offered;(v) The procedure under the program for determining a reasonable rate ofinterest;(vi) The types of collateral which may secure a participant loan; and(vii) The events constituting default and the steps that will be takento preserve plan assets in the event of such default.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Plan P authorizes the trustee to establish a participantloan program in accordance with section 408(b)(1) of the Act. Pursuantto this explicit authority, the trustee establishes a written program whichcontains all of the information required by andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2).Loans made pursuant to this authorization and the written loan programwill not fail under section 408(b)(1)(C) of the Act merely because thespecific provisions regarding such loans are contained in a separate documentforming part of the plan. The specific provisions describing the loan program,whether contained in the plan or in a written document forming part ofa plan, do affect the rights and obligations of the participants and beneficiariesunder the plan and, therefore, must in accordance with section 102(a)(1),be disclosed in the plan's summary plan description.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Reasonable Rate of Interest. </T3>A loan will be considered to beara reasonable rate of interest if such loan provides the plan with a returncommensurate with the interest rates charged by persons in the businessof lending money for loans which would be made under similar circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Plan P makes a participant loan to A at the fixedinterest rate of 8% for 5 years. The trustees, prior to making the loan,contacted two local banks to determine under what terms the banks wouldmake a similar loan taking into account A's creditworthiness and the collateraloffered. One bank would charge a variable rate of 10% adjusted monthlyfor a similar loan. The other bank would charge a fixed rate of 12% undersimilar circumstances. Under these facts, the loan to A would not beara reasonable rate of interest because the loan did not provide P with areturn commensurate with interest rates charged by persons in the businessof lending money for loans which would be made under similar circumstances.As a result, the loan would fail to meet the requirements of section 408(b)(1)(D)and would not be covered by the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) ofthe Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Pursuant to the provisions of plan P's participantloan program, T, the trustee of P, approves a loan to M, a participantand party in interest with respect to P. At the time of execution, theloan meets all of the requirements of section 408(b)(1) of the Act. Theloan agreement provides that at the end of two years M must pay the remainingbalance in full or the parties may renew for an additional two year period.At the end of the initial two year period, the parties agree to renew theloan for an additional two years. At the time of renewal, however, A failsto adjust the interest rate charged on the loan in order to reflect currenteconomic conditions. As a result, the interest rate on the renewal failsto provide a ``reasonable rate of interest'' as required by section 408(b)(1)(D)of the Act. Under such circumstances, the loan would not be exempt undersection 408(b)(1) of the Act from the time of renewal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>The documents governing plan P's participant loanprogram provide that loans must bear an interest rate no higher than themaximum interest rate permitted under State X's usury law. Pursuant tothe loan program, P makes a participant loan to A, a plan participant,at a time when the interest rates charged by financial institutions inthe community (not subject to the usury limit) for similar loans are higherthan the usury limit. Under these circumstances, the loan would not beara reasonable rate of interest because the loan does not provide P witha return commensurate with the interest rates charged by persons in thebusiness of lending money under similar circumstances. In addition, participantloans that are artificially limited to the maximum usury ceiling then prevailingcall into question the status of such loans under sections 403(c) and 404(a)where higher yielding comparable investment opportunities are availableto the plan.</ITAG>(f) <T3>Adequate Security. </T3>A loan will be considered to be adequatelysecured if the security posted for such loan is something in addition toand supporting a promise to pay, which is so pledged to the plan that itmay be sold, foreclosed upon, or otherwise disposed of in default of repaymentof the loan, the value and liquidity of which security is such that itmay reasonably be anticipated that loss of principal or interest will notresult from the loan. The adequacy of such security will be determinedin light of the type and amount of security which would be required inthe case of an otherwise identical transaction in a normal commercial settingbetween unrelated parties on arm's-length terms. A participant's vestedaccrued benefit under a plan may be used as security for a participantloan to the extent of the plan's ability to satisfy the participant's outstandingobligation in the event of default.(g) <T3>Effective date. </T3>This section is effective January 1, 1975, exceptwith respect to paragraph (d)(2) relating to specific plan provisions.Paragraph (d)(2) is effective for participant loans granted or renewedon or after the last day of the first plan year beginning on or after January1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date signed: January 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David M.
