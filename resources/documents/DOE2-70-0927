The results of epidemiologicalstudies are presented. The radiation-induced increment of the age-specificlung cancer rate can be interpreted in terms of a proportional hazardmodel. On the basis of this model, the relative fraction of total lungcancer frequency which might be initiated by the radon-daughter exposurein homes is estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
