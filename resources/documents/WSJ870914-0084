A bank spokesman said yesterday that Chairman Sir Kit McMahon met &quot;about 10 days ago&quot; with Maurice Saatchi, co-founder and chairman of Saatchi, a London-based advertising and business-services group. The spokesman said Mr. Saatchi offered &quot;some ideas that might lead effectively to a merger&quot; of Saatchi and Midland, the fourth-largest British bank.    The Midland spokesman said Sir Kit responded a couple of days later that Midland didn't want to pursue the idea. The spokesman cited a &quot;lack of commercial or strategic logic.&quot;    A Saatchi spokesman declined comment on the talks, citing their &quot;informal and private&quot; nature. But he acknowledged that Saatchi's expansion interests include financial services, partly because it believes its experience in working with blue-chip clients on a global scale would be relevant to that business as well as advertising and other services. &quot;We don't have blinkers on&quot; about the particular avenues for future growth in services, he said.    For Midland, Saatchi's approach is the latest sign that the bank ultimately might lose sole control of its destiny. Midland has insisted that it intends to remain independent, but some of its assets, including a 2,000-branch domestic network, are drawing interest. Analysts say Midland may have to merge with another group in order to compete on global markets.    Midland's previous international expansion efforts have foundered -- most notably its purchase in 1980 of a 57% stake in Crocker National Corp. Midland bought the remaining 43% soon thereafter, but last year it sold the California bank holding company to Wells Fargo Corp. In addition, despite recently boosting provisions for troubled Third World loans to #1.19 billion ($1.96 billion), the bank may again have to raise its loss reserves for the estimated #4.2 billion of such debt on its books.    The meeting with Mr. Saatchi took place before Hanson Trust PLC last week announced a stake of about 5.8% in the bank, the Midland spokesman said. The Hanson disclosure was seen as confirming that the bank is a possible takeover target.    While Midland's management continues to insist that the bank will remain independent, the Hanson disclosure followed by the Saatchi inquiry suggests the bank soon will have to move to take control of the situation, rather than continue responding to others' overtures.    Some insiders expect Sir Kit to become more willing to consider mergers. Disclosure of the Saatchi approach, along with Hanson's stake, have increased pressure on Sir Kit to resolve the questions over Midland's strategy.    The likelihood of government opposition to a hostile bid makes it important for any suitor to have Midland's agreement for any proposal. Other British concerns such as B.A.IT Industries PLC and General Electric Co. of Britain, which isn't related to the U.S. company of the same name, have long been rumored as possible bidders. Earlier this month, both indicated they aren't discussing a Midland bid.    Saatchi's interest in Midland indicates the far-reaching breadth of its ambitions. Following a string of takeovers of U.S. ad agencies that culminated with last year's purchase of Ted Bates Worldwide Inc., Saatchi today is the world's largest advertising group. Its drive for size in advertising has been questioned by some big advertisers who worry about conflicts outweighing the advantages of working with a much larger agency.    Saatchi, a firm believer in the importance of size, recently began pursuing service companies outside the advertising business. Company executives say their broad strategy is to position Saatchi as a supplier of all sorts of services, such as management consulting, to multinational corporate clients. Banking might fit within that definition, but the acquisition of a major bank like Midland also would involve Saatchi with a host of other activities unrelated to its current focus.    So far most of Saatchi's purchases in the service sector have involved marketing-support activities, such as public relations and design, that seem more closely related to advertising. It hasn't made a major move in management or technology consulting, two areas where its interests are clear. Saatchi also is exploring future investments in satellite broadcasting ventures.    The specific nature of Mr. Saatchi's &quot;idea&quot; for a combination with Midland isn't known. A straightforward takeover of the bank -- which has a market value roughly double Saatchi's value of just over #1 billion -- would face uncertain investor support. Some London analysts are skeptical of Saatchi's expansion strategy, and occasional rumors of impending acquisitions drive down Saatchi's share price, suggesting its ability to finance a bid with new equity might be limited. </TEXT></DOC>
