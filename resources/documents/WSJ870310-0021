The travel-guide offshoot of the tire company decided not to promote any restaurants in France to its highest rating. It took away one star from the former three-star establishment Pyramide in Vienne, which food critics said long had been resting on the reputation of its former chef, Fernand Point, who died in 1955. His widow died last year.    Michelin elevated eight restaurants to two stars from one. This year there are 19 three-star restaurants, 92 two-stars and 545 with one star.    Mr. Loiseau's restaurant, La Cote d'Or in Saulieu, was the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article on the importance of the Michelin ratings to French restaurateurs. </TEXT></DOC>
