Five of the firms, all so-called arbitrage boutiques, capitalized most on the profusion of corporate mergers and acquisitions, capturing 65% of the aggregate profits last year and more than 50% in each of the two prior years. And 23 firms engaged in risk arbitrage were found to have investment banking departments or affiliates working on mergers and acquisitions.    The findings indicate &quot;a billion-dollar potential conflict of interest,&quot; said Wisconsin Sen. William Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who requested the survey. He and other lawmakers will use the report this fall to buttress their efforts to tighten regulation of risk arbitrage.    Although a few of the firms lost money last year, the SEC survey shows that risk arbitrage has become increasingly lucrative. Aggregate profits for the 31 hit $566.6 million in 1986, up from $386.8 million in 1985 and $180.2 million in 1984. The identities of the firms in the survey were kept confidential at the request of the New York Stock Exchange, which gathered the financial data for the SEC staff.    &quot;The very companies engineering the current tidal wave of takeovers are involved in the deals, sometimes before the public finds out about them,&quot; the Wisconsin Democrat asserted. &quot;Something's amiss when the jockey bets on the race.&quot;    Sen. Proxmire expressed concern that a &quot;clique of securities firms&quot; may be &quot;playing roles which put them into possession of inside information that could be the key&quot; to their risk-arbitrage profits.    In the survey, 25 firms acknowledged investing in the stock of companies they expected to become takeover targets before any public announcement of a merger or acquisition. But SEC staff members pointed out that arbitragers routinely take such positions in the stock of undervalued companies they believe are ripe for takeover, or in the stock of companies in which a corporate raider is known to have quietly invested.    One objective of risk arbitrage is to take advantage of a run-up in price before a bid. But some arbitragers are suspected of spreading takeover rumors and acting in concert to put companies into play, thus creating more opportunities for profit. Sen. Proxmire maintains that arbitragers are &quot;systematically involved in corporate takeover abuses.&quot;    He said the survey, coupled with recent insider-trading scandals on Wall Street, shows that regulatory oversight of risk arbitrage is inadequate. Mr. Proxmire enlisted the SEC's help in collecting data after the arrests last February of three prominent arbitragers on conspiracy charges in connection with an alleged insider-trading scheme.    As part of a comprehensive takeover bill, he has proposed requiring any entity engaged in &quot;tender offer arbitrage&quot; to register with the SEC. Currently, most firms that employ risk arbitragers are registered as broker-dealers, but the SEC can't readily identify the arbitragers.    &quot;By first identifying all of the parties involved in this practice, the SEC can gain better insights into the business,&quot; Sen. Proxmire said. &quot;From there, we can draft more precise law.&quot;    The SEC survey's three-year profit total of $1.13 billion is probably understated, according to a memo from Annette Poulsen, the SEC's acting chief economist. Not included in the tally were the profits of Ivan Boesky's investment firms, including Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. L.P., the nearly $1 billion arbitrage fund he set up in March 1986, before he was charged with insider trading. And other arbitragers may have been left out of the survey, Ms. Poulsen said.    One arbitrage boutique in the survey earned $108.1 million last year, while another earned $107.2 million. But the profits they and other firms accrued made up only a small part of the total profits earned by all stockholders from corporate takeovers, according to the SEC memo. W.T. Grimm andamp; Co., a Chicago concern that tracks takeover activity, estimates that the 1984-86 profits of stockholders from mergers, leveraged buyouts and other transactions amounted to $118.4 billion, Ms. Poulsen said in the memo.    Assuming that the Grimm estimate is correct and the firms' figures are accurate, arbitrage profits amounted to only 1.4% of the three-year total, she said. </TEXT></DOC>
