The development should make it possible to detect this kind ofcancer early, when it can still be removed surgically, and tobetter determine how far it has progressed, Dr. David D. Stark andcolleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital reported in the Augustissue of the journal Radiology.   Doctors using the technique administer the iron oxide then takea cross-sectional picture with a standard magnetic resonanceimaging, or MRI, scanner. The iron oxide is absorbed by healthycells but not by cancerous ones, making the cancers clearly standout on magnetic pictures.   Tests on 60 people showed that the technique could spot tumorsas tiny as 3 millimeters, three times smaller can be found withother scanning methods.   Whether liver cancer is treated with surgery, chemotherapy orradiation depends on the stage of the disease.   ``Our purpose is to reduce some of the anguish of misdiagnosisand unnecessary surgery, as well as their cost, by accuratedetection of metastases (spread) in the liver, which before nowwere too small to be visible early enough to appropriately stagethe patient's disease prior to treatment,'' said Stark.</TEXT><HEAD>Altered Superconductor May Be Useful In Frictionless Bearings</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Superconductors usually repel magnets, but newexperiments show that with slight alterations they'll attract andhang suspended from magnets, raising the prospect of their use infrictionless bearings.   The researchers added silver oxide to the traditionalsuperconductor mixture of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen inpellets that they chilled in liquid nigrogen to make themsuperconducting. When they lowered a magnet toward a pellet, a``supercurrent'' appeared on the pellet's surface that repelled themagnet. But when the magnet was pulled back, the weakening of themagnetic field affecting the pellet triggered another supercurrentthat led to attraction toward the magnet.   The attraction was strong enough to suspend the superconductorabout half an inch below the magnet. It weakened if the magnet camecloser than the half-inch and strengthened farther away, so thepellet hung at the half-inch gap.   The suspension effect was reported by C.Y. Huang of LockheedMissiles andamp; Space Co.; M.K. Wu of the University of Alabama atHuntsville; and P.N. Peters and colleagues at the NASA MarshallSpace Flight Center in Huntsville, in the June 13 issue of AppliedPhysics Letters. Further work has involved Brian Schwartz ofBrooklyn College in New York, and others.   They suggest that the work could lead to development offrictionless bearings. Experts unconnected with the studies saidthe effect may help in understanding superconductivity, but theydoubted it had important practical applications.   Superconductors can carry electricity with no resistance.Scientists hope they will help in developing more powerfulcomputers, high-speed trains and other uses.</TEXT><HEAD>Sneezing After Sex Probably Not An Allergy, Doctor Says</HEAD><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   What sounds like an allergy to sex is more likelya reaction to a common nasal inflammation, a doctor says of apatient who sneezes repeatedly after intercourse.   ``This is the most unusual problem I have ever been presentedwith by a patient,'' Dr. William H. Hunter of Clemson, S.C., wrotein the question-and-answer section of last week's Journal of theAmerican Medical Association.   The problem is probably due to vasomotor rhinitis, ``a fairlycommon syndrome'' in which the nasal passages are chronicallyinflamed, responded Dr. Jeffrey A. Wald of San Diego, Calif.   The condition is characterized by ``hyperactive'' or``imbalanced'' control of certain nervous-system responses, Waldsaid. Some nasal tissue is similar to that in the penis, so sexualarousal thus may cause swelling of the mucous membranes inside thenose, and an increase in nasal secretions, he said.   Those symptoms likely trigger the sneezing attacks in Hunter'spatient _ a 60-year-old man with a history of allergies _ becauseof the nervous system impairment brought on by the rhinitis, Waldwrote.   Those suffering from rhinitis frequently don't respond totraditional treatment _ antihistimines and decongestants _ orcomplain of side effects, he wrote, suggesting intranasal use of adrug called ipratropium bromide if traditional treatment doesn'twork.</TEXT><HEAD>New Corn Variety Packs Better Nutrition, Panel Says</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new variety of corn provides higher qualityprotein than common types and could greatly help many of theworld's undernourished people, a National Research Councilcommittee says.   The ``quality-protein maize'' looks and tastes like common cornbut is nearly as good a protein source as skim milk, the committeesaid.   Corn is a dietary staple for some 200 million people, includingmaybe half the world's undernourished population. In some parts ofLatin America and Africa, it is the primary or sole protein sourcefor young children.   But protein in traditional corn does not contain enough of twoessential amino acids, lysine and tryptophan. So corn itself is notenough for acceptable growth and health, especially in children,the sick, and pregnant and lactating women, the council said in astatement.   The new corn variety was developed at Mexico's InternationalCenter for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat. The committee reportexpressed confidence that it will be grown worldwide before theturn of the century.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 28</NOTE></DOC>
