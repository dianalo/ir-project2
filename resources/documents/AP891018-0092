Mrs. Thatcher said South African President F.W. de Klerk hadmade a ``major step forward'' by releasing eight black nationalistleaders, allowing peaceful demonstrations and being willing to``consult all shades of opinion.''   ``We are most likely to achieve our aim by giving encouragement,not by trying to behave as if nothing significant had happened,''an aide, who asked not to be identified, quoted her as saying.   Mrs. Thatcher, the sole opponent in the Commonwealth ofsanctions against South Africa, spoke during a closed session soonshortly after the weeklong biennial summit opened.   Her aide said the prime minister ``thought sanctions at thisstage would be utterly irresponsible.''   Gongs, cymbals and Malaysian dancers greeted the leaders of theassociation of Britain and its former colonies as they filed intoKuala Lumpur's Putra World Trade Center.   In another development, the Commonwealth leaders elected ChiefEmeka Anyaoku of Nigeria as the new secretary-general over formerAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Malayasian Prime MinisterMahathir Mohamad, the summit host, refused to disclose the votingbreakdown after what had been a closely fought contest.   Anyaoku, 56, has been deputy secretary-general at theCommonwealth Secretariat in London since 1975. He will replaceGuyuanan Sir Shridath Ramphal, whose third five-year term expiresnext June.   Earlier, in opening speeches before the summit went into closedsession, Mahathir called for stronger sanctions against SouthAfrica, while Canada's Prime Minister Mulroney urged themaintenance of existing measures.   The opening speeches reflected differences on whether to pressfor tougher sanctions against South Africa now, or give de Klerksix months to implement promised reforms.   British officials said Mrs. Thatcher will oppose any move to seta six-month deadline as well as any tougher measures.   Debates on the deterioration of the global environment andinternational drug trafficking were also scheduled to dominate theinformal agenda. Mahathir, in a speech, blamed developed countriesfor the world's environmental problems on the developing countries.   Pakistan returned to the Commonwealth this month after a 17-yearabsence, and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto headed the delegation.   The leaders will spend the weekend in retreat at Langkawi Islandoff West Malaysia.</TEXT></DOC>
