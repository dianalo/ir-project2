In connection with Diamond Shamrock/Oxy, Mr. Stewart'stiming is off. Friday morning began with an initialannouncement, prior to the opening of the market, that Mr.Stewart fails to mention -- that Diamond and Oxy wererequesting that trading in their securities be closed pendingan announcement. The merger announcement did indeed finallycome at 10:23 a.m., but that was Pacific Time; in New York itwas already 1:23 p.m. Trading in Diamond didn't open until2:39 p.m., and Oxy at 2:41 p.m., well after the mergerannouncement.   2. Peter Ackerman could not have passed confidentialinformation about Diamond/Oxy to Mr. Milken. According to theSEC, Mr. Ackerman was not told of the merger until Friday.</LP><TEXT>   3. Mr. Stewart has concocted the story that Mr. Dahloverheard any phone conversation about Oxy on Friday betweenMessrs. Milken and Boesky. Mr. Dahl's lawyer has confirmedthat Mr. Dahl never told Mr. Stewart or anyone, at any time,that he ever overheard such a conversation. Had Mr. Dahl saidotherwise, surely the government would have used suchtestimony to prove insider-trading at the sentencing hearing,where Mr. Dahl was a government witness.   4. It is untrue that the government did not choose anyBoesky-related activities to present at the hearing. Thegovernment presented the Wickes deal as an example of Mr.Milken's alleged participation in criminal activity with Mr.Boesky, but Judge Wood did not buy it. Indeed, Mr. Stewart'sown book contradicts his assertion, for he writes in anendnote on the last page: &quot;Boesky wasn't called as a witness{because} the prosecutors had been dismayed by hisperformance at the Mulheren trial. . . .&quot;   5. If Mr. Stewart did indeed review &quot;every sentencingletter,&quot; he could not have written that Mr. Milken wasungenerous in general and indifferent to the welfare of hisemployees in particular.   6. My &quot;explanation&quot; of Mr. Milken's comment about &quot;buyingevery building from here to the ocean&quot; is not &quot;fanciful&quot; forI quoted the exact text of his speech.   7. Mr. Milken gave $86 million to charity before theinvestigation started. His contributions continued, yearafter year, in proportion to his income. He also gavegenerously of his time. Judge Wood stated at sentencing: &quot;Ihave taken into account that long before your current legalproblems you took a significant amount of your own personaltime to serve the community by working with disadvantagedchildren rather, for example, than using all your personaltime to acquire possessions.&quot;   (See related articles: &quot;In Defense of Michael Milken,&quot;&quot;`Mr. Dershowitz Draws the False Conclusion...'&quot; and &quot;`ATextbook Case of Insider Trading'&quot; -- WSJ Oct. 16, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
