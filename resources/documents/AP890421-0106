Thousands of Shiite Moslem worshipers chanted ``American spiesmust be executed!'' after they listened to Hashemi Rafsanjani'sallegations during a sermon at Tehran University.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, reporting on thespeaker's statements, said Rafsanjani alleged the rings wereinvolved in plots to overthrow Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini'sfundamentalist government and had been operating as far back as the1979 Islamic Revolution.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he had noinformation on the allegations. ``My information is we don't reallyknow what they're talking about. They make similar claims everyonce in a while about American spies when they need a littleattention.''   But there is little doubt U.S. intelligence agencies haveoperatives in Iran, given the Islamic Republic's deep hostility for``the Great Satan.''   Rafsanjani's statements appeared designed to stir upanti-Western sentiment to deflect attention from political problemsat home.   The Parliament speaker himself apparently has fallen from favorsince persuading Khomeini to accept an August cease-fire in theIran-Iraq war after a number of Iranian military defeats.   He said the agents included ``big American spies'' who werebeing interrogated, and he said the arrests had exposed the entireCentral Intelligence Agency in the Middle East.   Some spies were navy personnel who transmitted intelligence onIranian naval deployments to the U.S. Navy ``when they werefighting us in the Persian Gulf,'' Rafsanjani said.   He said the Iranian ship Iran Ajr, shot up and boarded by U.S.forces in the gulf on Sept. 21, 1987, while it was planting mines,was ``betrayed by these very people.''   Iranian security agents seized ``sophisticated equipment,''including radio transmitters, code books and even invisible inkused ``to send messages to the CIA,'' he claimed.   Rafsanjani did not say how many people had been arrested because``the Americans should not know how many of them have been trapped.There are too many.'' He also did not identify any of the accusednaval officers.   There have been reports three senior naval commanders wereexecuted in early April for plotting to overthrow the government.They were identified as Adm. Kianoosh Hakimi, commander of navalcommunications and joint operations with the air force; Adm.Ghahreman Malekzadeh, naval representative at the chief of staff'soffice; and Adm. Farhad Riahi, commander of the airborne units.   Dissident Iranian sources said about 20 other pro-Western navyofficers had been arrested for alleged spying.   The sources have reported that several commanders of theRevolutionary Guards have been executed or arrested in recent weeksfor plotting to assassinate Iranian leaders.   Rafsanjani said ``God's decree will be carried out'' and thealleged spies would be punished. He did not elaborate. He also said```we have suffered some catastrophes and some damage'' because ofthe spies.   He said the alleged spies would appear on state-run television``to explain their activities.'' Rafsanjani did not say when thatwould happen, but added: ``You will see that the arrest of so manyspies is unprecedented in contemporary history.''   Hardliners led by Interior Ministry Ali Akbar Mohtashemi andProsecutor-General Mohhamad Musavi Khoeiniha have tightened theirgrip on power at the expense of so-called pragmatists likeRafsanjani, who favor building bridges with the West to end Iran'sisolation.   That isolation has been enhanced by Khomeini's call for thedeath of British author Salman Rushdie, whose latest novel, ``TheSatanic Verses,'' is seen by many as insulting to Islam.   Even most Moslem countries have refused to support the deathcall.   The political casualties in Iran have included Khomeini'sdesignated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri. He wasdismissed last month after voicing increasing criticism ofKhomeini's policies and the revolution's shortcomings.   Rafsanjani has sought to ride out the turmoil and has recentlybeen touring military bases exhorting support for Khomeini.</TEXT></DOC>
