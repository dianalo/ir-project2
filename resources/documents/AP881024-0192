The news media and other sources reported at least 18 peoplekilled, scores missing and about 47,000 homeless.   A shipping company executive said a missing passenger ferry withnearly 500 people aboard was reported safe at a small island in thestorm-swept Visayan Sea.   Edgar Go, vice president of Sulpicio Lines, said another vesselradioed that it had seen the passenger ship Dona Marilyn nearMasbate island, 300 miles southeast of Manila, and all of thepassengers and crew were safe.   But Carlos Go, general manager of the Sulpicio Lines thatoperates the Dona Marilyn, said later that a vessel sent to thearea to confirm the report radioed that it had been unable tolocate the passenger craft. He said the search was continuing.   The Dona Marilyn crew reported engine trouble Monday while enroute from Manila to Tacloban City and said the ship was listing instormy seas.   Rodrigo Roldan, civil defense director on Panay Island, said atleast five people were killed Monday when a wind-blown bus careenedoff a bridge and plunged into a river.   He said 18 people, including the driver, were rescued but asmany as 38 passengers were missing.   Simeon Licayan, executive secretary of Cagayan de Oro, saidseven people were killed Sunday when tornados spawned by theadvancing typhoon struck remote villages near the city 500 milessouth of Manila.   The Philippines News Agency reported six people perished whenfloods washed away their homes near Pagadian City, 500 miles southof Manila. The Philippine Red Cross confirmed one death there.   The government weather service said Ruby's center passed about50 miles east of Manila early Tuesday and slashed into the farmingprovinces of Tarlac and Nueva Ecija.   Tuesday morning the storm weakened slightly but still had windsof 102 mph as it moved about 20 miles east of the huge U.S.-runClark Air Base 50 miles north of Manila, according to the weatherservice.   U.S. Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at the air base, said thestorm blew down a number of large trees as it passed.   He said the extent of damage to the base facilities had not beendetermined, but aircraft that could not be sheltered had been movedto an undisclosed ``safe location.''   Schools were closed at Clark and the U.S.-operated Subic NavyBase and the American armed forces television network said only``mission-essential personnel'' were on duty at U.S. militaryfacilities.   In Manila all mayor banks and the city's two stock marketssuspended operations Tuesday.   There were power outages and scattered flooding throughout thecapital.   Some commercial flights were canceled and schools were closed inManila.   ``This is one of the worst typhoons this year,'' said JuanitoLirios, deputy weather service director, just before the stormswept by Manila. ``If we do not take care there could be a greatloss of lives.''   Ruby is the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to hit thePhilippines this year and the second in four days.
