(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Teen-age AIDS victim Ryan White sat athis kitchen table back in Indiana with a couple of Hollywood filmmakers, eating pizza and reading a new movie script about hiscelebrated fight to return to school.   At one point, Ryan recalled, director John Herzfeld asked him toread the part of another young AIDS victim who had befriended himwhile they were in the hospital.   Ryan didn't know it, but he was auditioning for the role. He gotit.   ``He's a natural,'' said Linda Otto, co-executive producer of``The Ryan White Story,'' an ABC movie starring George C. Scottwhich is being filmed in Statesville through Sept. 9.   To Ryan, his small role in the film reinforces the message thatAIDS cannot be transmitted through casual contact. ``It tells thestory, plus it helps educate people about AIDS and the hardshipspeople go through,'' he said in an interview Friday.   Ryan will appear as an older hemophiliac who, like Ryan,contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion.   ``He didn't have a very positive outlook,'' Ryan said about hisfriend who died from the disease. The film will not depict Chad'sdeath.   The role of Ryan is being played by Lucas Haas, who starredopposite Harrison Ford in ``Witness.'' Judith Light of ``Who's theBoss?'' stars as Ryan's mother, Jeanne. Scott plays the part of thefamily's attorney, Charles Vaughn.   The softspoken Ryan said it hasn't been difficult to work on amovie about his struggle with a deadly disease and the anguish hisfamily went through in 1985 when residents of his native Kokomo,Ind., wanted to keep him from entering school.   ``It's kind of weird seeing someone else playing my life,'' hesaid with a smile Friday at the Iredell County Courthouse, wherethe court scenes depicting the Whites' legal battles were beingfilmed.   Ryan is 16 now but looks younger because of his small size.Slouched back in his chair, he looks like any other teen-ager withhis untied high-top sneakers and close-cropped haircut.   He is, however, far from typical.   ``He never feels sorry for himself,'' Ms. Otto said. ``And hedoesn't want anyone else to feel sorry for him. I've learned somuch from being around him.''   The movie will describe some of the legal and other battles thefamily went through since Ryan contracted AIDS in 1984. It followshis attempts to return to school, a controversy that divided theresidents of Kokomo and forced the Whites to eventually leave town.   The film ends with Ryan's first day of classes at HamiltonHeights High School in Arcadia, Ind. Ryan was scheduled to fly backhome to Cicero early in the week so he can be ready for the startof school.   Until then, he will continue to hang around the set.   ``The crew is in love with him,'' Ms. Otto said.   While the movie's focus is a young boy with a fatal disease, italso is a testimony to his vigor and spirit.   ``This is not a story about a boy dying of AIDS,'' Ms. Ottosaid. ``It's the story of a boy living with AIDS and how a town waspolarized by it. It's a microcosm of what it was like in thiscountry three years ago, and, to some extent, what it's still likenow.   ``This is not a movie about a family's tragedy,'' she said.``It's a family miracle. I'm totally inspired by having known theWhites.''</TEXT></DOC>
