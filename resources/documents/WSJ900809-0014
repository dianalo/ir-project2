Pretax profit was aided by a net reduction in totaldeveloping-country provisions to #775 million from #876.1million a year earlier. Pretax earnings before theseprovisions fell 8% to #192 million from #208.2 million. Butpretax profit growth was held in check by tighter interestmargins, Third World loan sales, and relatively flatoperating results from African and Middle East operations, aswell as provisions against British corporate loans and sometroubles with advances in Australia and Hong Kong. The bankhad issued a series of profit warnings this year, largelybecause of its exposure to some troubled British corporateborrowers.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
