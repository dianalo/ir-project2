Ford offered to negotiate improved job security and toboost pensions for its UAW workers. Meanwhile, Chrysler askedits UAW-represented employees to accept substantialconcessions in benefits. The offer virtually ensures that theunion will not select Chrysler to set the pattern for itsnegotiations with the Big Three auto makers. Among the offerssubmitted, General Motors Corp. was the only one to propose abase wage increase.</LP><TEXT>   Ford's offer includes unspecified lump-sum payments, butno base wage increases. The auto maker also wants the unionto allow it to offer incentives to employees to move intohealth maintenance organizations or preferred provider plans.   Chrysler made its initial offer to the UAW Friday, whileFord and GM submitted their proposals Thursday. The UAW isbargaining separately with each of them, and is set to selectby tomorrow one of the three as its target for negotiating apattern-setting pact. The union will work to reach agreementwith the target company by Sept. 14, when contracts with allthree companies expire. After reaching agreement, the unionwill then press the two other companies to agree to virtuallyidentical terms.   Traditionally, the UAW chooses as its target the companythat best suits its objectives and strategies for thenegotiations. The union has said that obtaining job securityfor its 450,000 members who work for the Big Three automakers will be its top objective in talks this year. It'sbeen widely speculated that GM will be the target this yearbecause the company has nearly twice as many UAW members asFord and Chrysler combined, and the No. 1 auto maker hascontinually crossed swords with the UAW over job security.Perhaps more important, the union's strongest personality isStephen Yokich, who heads the union's GM department.   GM's offer last week included increased base wages, andexpanded benefits for workers it lays off, but didn't includebroader job guarantees for UAW members. In contrast, Fordsaid it is willing to tackle the issue of job security, butdidn't provide any definitive proposal.   Chrysler's offer drew sharp criticism from UAW officialsbecause, unlike the offers of GM and Ford, Chrysler's offerseeks &quot;givebacks.&quot; The No. 3 auto maker asked UAW bargainersto move their workers out of their traditional Blue Cross andBlue Shield healthcare coverage and into health maintenanceorganizations and preferred provider plans.   The auto maker also asked the union to drop therequirement that Chrysler hire one worker for every two itloses through attrition. Stan Marshall, the UAW's topChrysler bargainer, signaled his disappointment by walkingout of the bargaining room without discussion almostimmediately after Chrysler presented the offer.   Chrysler's offer &quot;more or less left (Mr. Marshall)speechless,&quot; a UAW official said.</TEXT></DOC>
