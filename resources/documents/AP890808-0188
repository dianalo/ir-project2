(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American executives spend too much time onunproductive or unnecessary phone calls, according to a survey oftop corporate managers. Motivational Systems, amanagement-development consultant that preaches time management andefficiency, surveyed the phone habits of 200 top executives at thelargest 1,000 U.S. corporations.   The results, according to company President Roger Flax, show anundisciplined approach to the telephone that costs money and hurtsproductivity.   Flax said the 200 executives responding to the survey were chiefexecutive officers, chief financial officers and managing partnersof major companies. They were questioned about the amount of timethey spent on the phone, the results they achieved and the numberof follow-up calls needed.   Overall, the executives said they spend about 28 percent oftheir working days on the phone. Based on a nine-hour work day,Flax said, that means 13 hours a week _ or 14.5 weeks a year _ arespent on the phone.   Flax estimates that about four of those weeks _ or hundreds ofhours a year _ are wasted calling people back, reaching the wrongperson or simply not being organized enough to get the job donewith one call.   Flax said he tells clients of his West Orange-based company thattheir servitude to the telephone is unneccesary. He said phone timecan be cut dramatically by making phone calls in clusters ratherthan interrupting the day's routine, by never leaving vaguemessages because they invite the same and by having a secretaryscreen incoming calls.   Larry Baker, president of Time Management Center Inc. of St.Louis, said many executives are needlessly interrupted becausetheir secretaries have not been taught which calls to let throughand which can be better handled elsewhere.   He suggests keeping track of a week's worth of incoming calls,then going over the calls and classifying them so the secretarysees the principles behind the decisions he or she has to make.   Baker uses four basic classifications: calls that need to be putthrough directly, those that should be referred elsewhere, thosethe secretary can handle and calls that need returning. Each groupcan be broken into efficient subgroups, he said.   ``The key is basing the system on the real world experience ofcalls that actually came in one week,'' he said.   Flax also suggests writing an informal agenda before importantcalls and learning the fine art of cutting the call short when theconversation gets sidetracked.   ``Let the caller know that you have a meeting to attend, aletter to dictate or a project that needs your attention,'' hesaid. ``Some people need a gentle reminder that others may bepressed for time.''   Baker agrees.   ``When two people get on a telephone, they're really having atwo-person meeting,'' he said. ``The person who receives the callusually doesn't know it's coming and so having an agenda gives theother person a great advantage.''   David Blake, dean of Rutgers University's graduate school ofmanagement, warns against going too far for the sake of efficiency.He said executives must keep in mind that business is essentially anetwork of personal relationships.   ``The development of inter-personal skills and the ability torelate to people are both important components of a successfulbusinessman,'' he said. ``We all seek efficiency, but we're makinga mistake if we forsake social graces.''   But Blake agreed that an organized, well-balanced phone strategyproduces superior results.   At American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. _ where one would notexpect to find a passion for shorter telephone calls _ a range ofcourses is available to counsel executives and other clients ontelephone technique.   Jim Taylor, the district manager for client education trainingat the company's divisional headquarters in Bridgewater, said timemanagement goes hand in hand with good communications.   ``If you manage your time efficiently as an executive, forinstance, setting aside a time period to make most of your calls,you get more done,'' he said.   He stopped short of recommending brevity, however.</TEXT></DOC>
