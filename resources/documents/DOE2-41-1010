The primary objective to generate data onengineering index properties and laboratory strength deformation characteristicsof the immediate floor strata associated with coal seams in Illinois.The data are required for effective design of mine workings (mine openingsand coal pillars) for optimum mine stability and resource extractionunder planned and unplanned subsidence options. An additional objectivewas to develop a computerized data base of the available and projectgenerated index properties and strength-deformation characteristics ofimmediate floor strata on a IBM-PC/XT microcomputer. 24 refs., 34 figs.,17 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
