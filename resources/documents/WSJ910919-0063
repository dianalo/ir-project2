Phone customers up and down the East Coast and as far awayas California were unable to complete calls that passedthrough Manhattan late Tuesday afternoon and evening. Theswitch cutoff also shut transmission through more than 200ultra-high-capacity communications lines that carry phonecalls, computer data, financial transactions and air-trafficcontrol information. ATandamp;T systems were running normallyyesterday.</LP><TEXT>   Government officials who demanded an explanation foryesterday's outage from ATandamp;T's top executives were told thatthe company had gone over to its own power generators becauseof an interruptible service discount plan ATandamp;T has with thelocal utility Consolidated Edison Corp. Under the plan, ATandamp;Tshifted Tuesday to its own generator at Con Ed's request, aprocedure that ATandamp;T must follow to qualify for the lowerelectric rate.   When ATandamp;T switched to its own generators, rectifiers inthe power supplies that feed its switching center blew,sending the center to emergency batteries, ATandamp;T said. (Therectifiers convert AC power to DC.) Then ATandamp;T experienced asecond failure: Employees in its switching center failed torespond to alarms that warned that emergency batteries hadkicked in. After six hours the batteries lost juice.   ATandamp;T, which has slashed hundreds of millions of dollarsout of its costs in the last year, said the contractualarrangement with Con Ed wasn't driven by penny pinching. &quot;Thecost savings is inconsequential,&quot; said a spokesman in aninterview last night. &quot;We're motivated by the fact that we'rea big corporate user and we have to behave responsibly as agood corporate citizen.&quot;   Initially, ATandamp;T wouldn't comment on whether it had signedup for Con Ed's interruptible rate discount. The companyblamed Tuesday's outage on a &quot;routine power-sharing&quot;agreement with Con Ed that went awry. Joseph Nacchio, vicepresident of the company's Business Communications Services,said ATandamp;T was asked by Con Ed to switch over to its own powergenerating equipment when New York experienced a poweroverload during unusually hot weather.   Mr. Nacchio said ATandamp;T agreed to go to its own powergeneration because of ATandamp;T's &quot;operating agreements {with ConEd} that have been in place for years,&quot; and ATandamp;T's &quot;socialresponsibility to the New York power grid.&quot;   But Charles Donaldson, chief of the New York AttorneyGeneral's Energy and Utilities Unit, said ATandamp;T has no choicebut to get off Con Ed's system during a power emergency. &quot;Italked to Victor Pelson {group executive of ATandamp;T'slong-distance business}, and he had just gotten off the phonewith {New York City} Mayor David Dinkins,&quot; said Mr.Donaldson. He said that Mr. Pelson &quot;confirmed they were onthe discount plan, which is called an `interruptible rate.'Con Ed also confirmed it for me.&quot;   A Con Edison spokeswoman said, &quot;We call it `curtailableelectric service.' ATandamp;T and about 70 other companies are onthe plan.&quot; ATandamp;T went on the plan last year, said a Con Edspokesman. Under the plan, a big company such as ATandamp;T, whichhas its own backup power generators, can opt for a discountor &quot;interruptible rate.&quot; In return, ATandamp;T would agree to gooff-line to its own generators if Con Ed needed the power foran emergency such as a heat wave.   When power to ATandamp;T's huge tandem switching center in lowerManhattan blew, so did ATandamp;T communications service.   Calling for an investigation in the communicationsbreakdown, New York State Attorney General Robert Abramsyesterday said he questioned &quot;ATandamp;T's decision to useinterruptible power to save money. Not only does ATandamp;T forfeitintegral reliability with this false economy, but thecompany's cost-cutting decision has major safety and economicconsequences when there is a power failure.&quot;   In Washington, Rep. Robert E. Wise (D., W.Va.), who chairsa panel of the House Government Operations Committee, askedAlfred E. Sikes, chairman of the Federal CommunicationsCommission, to assist his committee in an investigation ofTuesday's outage. &quot;So far,&quot; wrote Mr. Wise in a letter to Mr.Sikes, &quot;the impact of {past} outages has been measured inhours wasted and dollars lost; I want to take every stepnecessary to make sure that future outages are not measuredin terms of property destroyed and lives lost.&quot;   ATandamp;T's second major outage this year and the third sinceJanuary 1990 may be the best thing that has ever happened toits rivals in the cutthroat long-distance phone business.   While MCI Communications Corp. has not tried to publiclycapitalize on ATandamp;T's predicament in the past, the latestoutage prompted the company to take a very tough stance.Daniel Akerson, MCI executive vice president and groupexecutive, said the phone failure &quot;has public safetyimplications for the country. . . . God forbid if you had achild flying around yesterday. It could have been reallyugly.&quot;   A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman insisted thatsafety wasn't compromised Tuesday. &quot;We have procedures todeal with such an emergency situation, both for pilots andcontrollers, and they were put into effect,&quot; said DuncanPardue, a spokesman for the FAA's Eastern Region.   &quot;We're not going to comment on MCI statements,&quot; saidATandamp;T's spokesman. &quot;We expect our competitors to compete.&quot;   ATandamp;T's spokesman said the company has spent $18 billionmodernizing its network in the last seven years and is&quot;already investing $200 million to improve power supplies andother critical backup so that the risk in the future isgreatly diminished.&quot;   Mr. Akerson said big customers such as the FAA, whoseair-traffic control lines provided by ATandamp;T went down Tuesday,must build redundant networks that include another carrier'slines for emergency backup.   Mr. Nacchio said ATandamp;T has been working on a plan &quot;forseveral months&quot; to come up with alternate communicationsroutes for the FAA air traffic control system. By next month,he said, multiple backup routes will be in operation, makingit less likely that such a disruption in service will occur.   However, the FAA still wouldn't be able to switch over tothe lines of another carrier such as MCI because its onlycarrier is ATandamp;T. And the agency's attempts to line upalternate carriers that would make its network fullyredundant were stymied earlier this summer when the GeneralServices Administration suspended the FAA's authority to letthe contract.   Jack B. Grubman, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebberInc., said that ATandamp;T had a huge network outage in January1990 and another one this year, but &quot;their market sharehasn't changed any. This will casue no changes in thecompetitive landscape.&quot;   But MCI's Mr. Akerson says Tuesday's event was strikethree. &quot;We're not gloating here,&quot; said Mr. Akerson. &quot;ATandamp;Tadvertises a self-healing network and they didn't deliver . .. They're not infallible.&quot;   Mr. Nacchio said that &quot;when we talk about our self-healingnetwork, we're talking about implementing it over time. Thesesystems worked pretty well yesterday. The network didcomplete a high percentage of calls.&quot; However, he declined tocomment on how many calls the ATandamp;T network put through.   A spokesman at the nation's No. 3 carrier, US SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.,said the company didn't plan to run ads pointing out the ATandamp;Toutage. &quot;But we will take the opportunity to point out to ourcustomers that ATandamp;T's ad claims of having the most reliablenetwork don't ring true.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
