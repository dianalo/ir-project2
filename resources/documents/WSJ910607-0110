The trade group, which represents 140 major food, drug andpackaging companies, accused the agency of &quot;short-circuiting&quot;a plan enacted by Congress last year for bringing uniformityand clarity to food labeling by May 1993. Similar, butmilder, criticism was voiced by the National Food ProcessorsAssociation, another trade group.</LP><TEXT>   The Grocery Manufacturers argued that the agency shouldhave adopted new rules under a 1990 nutrition labeling lawbefore cracking down on specific freshness and no-cholesterolclaims. &quot;The FDA is `cherry picking' in an enormously broadfield, picking off one claim after another, where Congresshas already established policies and principles,&quot; complainedSherwin Gardner, spokesman for the group.   &quot;The sooner FDA gets on with the job of drafting its rules. . . the quicker industry can go about the massive job ofrevising the existing food label,&quot; said Roger Coleman,spokesman for the food processors group.   David Kessler, the new FDA commissioner, has taken theposition that the agency has authority to take enforcementaction immediately, rather than wait two years for the newrules to take effect. Yesterday, he announced that KraftGeneral Foods Inc., a Philip Morris Cos. unit, had agreed todrop percentage fat-free claims on its cottage cheeseproducts. He said such claims for products whose caloriescome largely from its fat content are &quot;nothing more than amarketing gimmick.&quot; Other food companies are expected tofollow Kraft's example and discard such claims on many oftheir products.   Several companies stopped making freshness claims fortheir orange juice and pasta sauce in April after the FDA hadU.S. marshals seize a shipment of Procter andamp; Gamble Co. orangejuice because of misleading freshness claims. Twentycompanies dropped their no-cholesterol claims in recent weeksafter the FDA challenged such claims for corn and canola oil,which, though lacking cholesterol, are loaded with fat.   Consumer and health advocates applauded the FDA forshowing new aggressiveness after years of taking alaissez-faire approach. &quot;The American Health Associationwants people to be free to make healthier dietary choiceswithout the burden of misleading and unsubstantiated claims,&quot;said Virgil Brown, president-elect of the association.</TEXT></DOC>
