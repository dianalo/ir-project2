This effect seems to be particularly sensitive to threeexperimental parameters: the accelerating voltage, the dose and the specimentemperature. It is shown that the density of defects becomes greaterwhen the accelerating voltage is raised. Due to thermal effects, thesize of the loops increases and their number decreases when the specimentemperature is increased. When the irradiation time is long enough, anotherkind of defects due to vacancies can be observed.</TEXT></DOC>
