At a hearing Feb. 2, immigration judge Bernard Hornbach grantedpolitical asylum to Yun Pan Lee, 26, who had argued he would bepunished if returned to China because of that country's strictpopulation controls, which limit most families to one child.   Lee and his wife have two children, and a third was ``forciblyaborted'' in the fifth month by government order, said John Wu,Lee's lawyer. The wife and two children are still in China.   The case could have ``staggering'' impact, said immigrationlawyer David Mainland. It could encourage would-be Chineseimmigrants to risk illegal entry to the United States by offeringthem new possibilities of asylum, he said.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is appealing the grantof asylum, saying Lee offered scant proof of persecution by theChinese government.   It could take more than two years for Lee's case to come up for ahearing with the Board of Immigration Appeals in Washington, Wu said.   Lee, who is living in New York, is determined to remain in thiscountry and is seeking a work permit, Wu said.   Lee claimed during the immigration hearing that after his wifegave birth to their second son in June 1982, Chinese authoritiesparaded him through the streets as a ``counterrevolutionary,'' cutoff electricity and water at his home and imposed a heavy school tax.   Lee said he obtained a phony passport in Singapore and wasarrested Oct. 11 when he tried to enter the country through SanFrancisco International Airport.   INS attorney Alberto Gonzalez said Lee's testimony was madeunbelievable by his ``implausible and inconsistent stories,'' andthat he had failed to establish possible persecution by the Chinesegovernment.   Gonzalez said that Lee could return to China and escapepersecution by appealing to higher government officials or moving toa district where birth control policy was not so vigorously enforced.   Aggressive birth control policies are pursued in most areas ofChina.   Wu acknowledged that Lee had made conflicting statements toimmigration officials and later changed his story in court. Heattributed the lapses to Lee's fear of deportation.</TEXT></DOC>
