Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., one of the Sandamp;L industry'sstaunchest defenders as chairman of the House financialinstitutions subcommittee, complained in a letter to FDIC ChairmanL. William Seidman that his agency has been turning over too manyof its duties to state bank examiners.   ``I do not intend to stand by and allow your agency to create anexamination crisis in which the taxpayers will have to pay hundredsof billions of dollars to solve a commercial bank crisis,''Annunzio said. ``Congress cannot afford to permit any additionalslackening of bank examination and supervision.''   Since Feb. 6 when Bush announced his Sandamp;L bailout plan, the FDIChas diverted more than one-fourth of staff of 2,029 bank examinersto seize supervisory control of 220 insolvent or nearly insolventSandamp;Ls.   In the interim, Annunzio said, the FDIC has told state bankingcommissioners of ``significant reductions'' in its examinations ofmost banks and has canceled training programs for state examiners.   ``You testified that `we are confident we can handle both ...long-term and short-term (savings and loan supervisory) roleswithout undermining our bank supervisory activities,''' Annunziosaid in his letter to Seidman. ``These statements were made at thesame time you were abdicating your supervisory responsibilities.''   Under Sandamp;L legislation approved by the Senate and two Housecommittees, the FDIC would be given expanded powers to regulatethrift institutions formerly under the authority of the FederalHome Loan Bank Board.   Annunzio said he was going to hold hearings ``to reconsider''that new authority in the wake of what the FDIC has told statebanking officials about limiting its examinations to only the``most critical bank cases.''   Alan Whitney, an FDIC spokesman, said a response to Annunzio'sletter had not yet been prepared but added, ``We're confident thatwe can demonstrate that our statements were accurate.''   Whitney conceded that examination schedules have been delayedand that some training sessions for state examiners were postponed.   ``We never denied this assignment that the president asked us toundertake in February is putting a strain on our people and wouldhave some effect on our operations,'' he said.   ``But we're confident that the examination of commercial bankshas not suffered because of it,'' added. ``No problem bank has hadits examination delayed by as much as a day.''   The FDIC already has shifted back to bank examinations some ofthe 550 examiners it had devoted to the most troubled Sandamp;Ls in Marchand through most of April, Whitney said.   Prior to assuming its new role in the Sandamp;L crisis, the FDIC hadplanned to expand its examination staff by 200 people this year.With the increased powers it is being given under the newlegislation, it plans to add another 450 to 600, Whitney said.</TEXT></DOC>
