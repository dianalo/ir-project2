It was, I suppose, the very common sort of rape that oftengoes unreported. I was a student traveling through Europe whohitchhiked to save money. The man did not, by any stretch ofthe imagination, resemble a &quot;rapist&quot; (if there is a generic,scary face conjured up by that phrase). He was middle-agedand slightly balding. He wore a sports jacket. He had afriendly dog in the back seat. The car was either a Renaultor Peugeot, I can't remember, but it was what automanufacturers call &quot;sporty&quot; and well kept up.   As he drove he spoke about the music of Liszt, and hisfavorite paintings, and the kinds of things I guess hethought would charm a young student. I didn't listen reallybut instead watched the passing countryside, my head restingsleepily against the window. It was only when my headsuddenly knocked hard against the glass as the car veered offthe road into a thicket, and when I reached for a door handlethat -- why had I not noticed this before? -- had beenremoved, my hand grasping for a severed metal knob, that Irealized what was about to happen.   An hour later my body lay in a field where he had pushedme from the car. I was not badly damaged. He had hit me onlywhen I resisted and then not hard enough to cause bruises.This did not prevent me from believing through most of itthat he was going to kill me.   Still, I did not report this rape because I couldn't. Hehad obviously raped many women in the same way because --like an accomplished mugger or bank robber -- each aspect ofthe crime had been thought out in advance and modified withpractice until it had been perfected, from the missing doorhandle to the way he was able to drive away without hisheadlights on so I wouldn't be able to read his licenseplate.   What I remembered of him would not be helpful to thepolice: a curling lip, a sneering voice, a physicaldescription -- balding, plumpish, middle-aged, moustache --that could fit a thousand traveling salesmen. I don't evenrecall the color of the car. Had I been able to take him tocourt, I would have done so unhesitatingly, encouraged by thefact I could have done so with relative anonymity. As it is,he has probably raped a hundred women since me, maybe more.   I'm not in the habit of recalling this story, certainlynever for the titillation of newspaper readers. I would nothave spoken of it again had there not arisen a movement thatseeks to unmask women like myself and force us into thepublic arena baring our sordid little stories. This movementis led by feminists and endorsed by newspaper editors whoclaim it is in our best interest, and the public's bestinterest, to have the shield of anonymity that hastraditionally protected us snatched away.   Admittedly, in a society in which transsexuals,adulterers, mass-murderers, child molesters, etc. feelcompelled to share their personal problems with the viewersof &quot;Oprah,&quot; and a society in which the most ordinary ofpersons who finds himself in a bit of a spot may wake up to700 cameras on his lawn, it does seem &quot;quaint andold-fashioned&quot; (as one editor put it) to protect the identityof a victim of sexual assault.   But this is not, I'm afraid, the main reason behind therecent campaign for publishing victims' names in the press.Well before William Kennedy Smith went drinking at Au Bar inPalm Beach and before the Central Park jogger had been rapedand beaten to a pulp by a gang of teenagers, groups offeminists gave editors the moral authority to publish thenames of victims in order to further the feminists'ideological cause. Rape is not simply a violent crime or asexual crime, they insisted, but must be regarded as apolitical crime as well.   The most prominent example of this attitude -- and theevent that initiated the controversy over whether to namevictims -- appeared in the Des Moines Register last year. Thenewspaper published a series in which a rape victim told herstory and allowed her name to be printed. The series won aPulitzer Prize this year. In explaining why she had chosen toprint the articles, the paper's editor, Geneva Overholser,offered reasoning that had become conventional wisdom in themost current feminist circles: that sheltering a rapevictim's identity compounds her feelings of shame and guilt-- that it perpetuates the so-called stigma of rape -- andthat by bringing victims out into the open, the public ismade aware of the true extent of the crime.   &quot;There are feminist arguments why it might not be a badidea to name the victim,&quot; a director of the Women's RightsProject of the American Civil Liberties Union told Sunday'sNew York Times. &quot;It might be a step toward destigmatizingand, by making rape less of a faceless crime, it brings homethe horror.&quot;   Thus, those victims of rape who don't want to spill theirstories to reporters are being told that their attitude isnot politically correct -- that they are, by implication,being cowardly and selfish for not wanting to sacrifice theirprivacy for a larger cause.   Some years after my own incident, I had an urge tovolunteer for work at a Rape Crisis Center. Since I had beenunable to bring the man who raped me to justice, I thought Icould at least help other victims through their ordeal. Icalled two centers, one based at a university inMassachusetts, another connected to a large city hospital. Iinterviewed with both and read their counseling manuals,which they told me were standard among such centers.   With horror I realized that the purpose of theseorganizations was not to help a rape victim overcome herexperience, and to go on to lead a life that would involvenormal relations with men. It was, as the manuals succinctlydescribed it, to gently prod the victim into realizing thetrue nature of the crime committed against her: that she hadnot been attacked by one man, but was the victim of animpulse common to all men. A victim &quot;recovered&quot; by becomingpoliticized by her experience, by finding &quot;empowerment&quot; inher new victim status -- in grasping the idea that withinevery man, including husbands and fathers, lurks a potentialrapist.   The feminists' desire to thrust rape victims into thelimelight results from this ideological approach to thecrime. They want to show that rape is common, that it happensto all types of women. This may be true enough, but they wanta specific conclusion drawn: that rape forms the basis ofrelations between all men and women. Until these relationsare acknowledged and changed, rape will continue to happen.   This explains a little bit why rape has become anaccusation so casually flung around on college campusesrecently. The phenomenon of &quot;date rape&quot; -- which I've heard asophomore use to describe an unwanted, and rebuffed, attemptat a kiss -- underscores the violent tensions currentfeminists insist underlie even the most innocent ofmale-female relations.   Yet in their zeal to expose rape as common and to advancetheir own agenda, these feminists are prepared to sacrificethe privilege of anonymity given to rape victims, regardlessof the opinions or wishes of the victims themselves. Thisflies in the face of the admirable efforts of a previousgeneration of feminists who lobbied to prevent trials ofrapists from becoming trials of the victims' sexual pasts.Those feminists, including representatives of the NationalOrganization for Women, have argued against the release ofvictims' names in both the Central Park jogger and WilliamKennedy Smith cases.   But their work will all be undone if the new sentimentprevails -- if the public comes to agree with those likeGeneva Overholser who wonder &quot;whether something that grew outof genuine feminist concerns in the '70s is in the long haulserving women and society well.&quot;   Because rape has become so politically charged -- an&quot;issue&quot; -- it is almost impossible to confront it from themere perspective of human decency. Men, and news editors, canbe easily seduced by feminist argument when it suits theirown interests: Why, in this age of equality, should womenhave special protection? Why should the man's name be draggedthrough the mud? If women want to be sexually liberated, thenwhy don't they accept the sometimes nasty consequences ofthat liberation?   The reason, simply, is this: Rape remains the mostprofound of assaults because it violates a woman's verybeing, her sexual identity. Publishing a rape victim's nameis tantamount to raping her again -- because publishing hername means also publishing her life story, her photograph,her sexual proclivities, and the incident of the rape in asmuch lurid detail as possible.   Instead of living through her ordeal again just once at atrial, and then being allowed to retreat back into herprivate life, a victim will live through her ordeal everymorning in the newspapers and every evening on the news, andeverytime she steps outside when someone asks, &quot;Aren't you .. . ?&quot; Her sexual trauma will be the subject of dinner-timediscussions among her relatives and the subway reading ofrush-hour commuters. It will be difficult, if not impossible,for her to have any future relationship with a man that isn'tmarred by the public reputation of the rape. The rape becomesthe animating or relevant aspect of her personality toothers. She is not allowed to escape it.   Those of us who have suffered the common, smutty,anonymous type of rape -- the rapes that occur by thethousands -- may at least recover in privacy. No one, so far,is interested in publishing our stories. We may put theincident behind us if we can and never, if we wish, have tothink of it again, nor let it intrude upon our relationshipswith others. It is only the victims of sensational,newsmaking rapes -- those who need privacy most desperately-- whose identities the media toy with releasing in the nameof the public good.   Anonymity for these victims, like others, is indeed aprivilege, and a woman bears the responsibility not to abuseit -- not to use it to make spurious charges. In return forthis, society acknowledges the unique horror of the crimecommitted against victims of rape, and respects their requestfor privacy. Unfortunately, in a world of shrinking privacy,the power to decide who gets it, and who deserves it, isincreasingly in the hands of feminist activists andassignment editors. And to these people, the victim and herwishes are inevitably their last consideration.</TEXT></DOC>
