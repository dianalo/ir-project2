(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jerry Falwell denounced a group ofabortion rights activists as skinheads, Nazis and homosexuals whodeserved one another. Falwell, speaking to worshipers Sunday at theRehoboth Baptist Church, also called the National Organization forWomen ``the National Order of Witches'' and the American CivilLiberties Union the ``Anti-Christian Liberties Union.''   The television preacher from Lynchburg, Va., was invited by thechurch's pastor, who is a trustee at Falwell's Liberty University.   About 70 sign-carrying pro-choice advocates shouted ``don't goin'' to the congregation and spoke out against Falwell's support forOperation Rescue, an anti-abortion organization.   Falwell told his audience he had heard that the protestersincluded ``skinheads, Nazis, pro-abortionists and gays. ... Theyprobably deserve each other.''   He also criticized Congress for including AIDS victims inlegislation aiding the handicapped.   Protester Jack Pelham, founder of the Coalition Against OperationRescue, said he was protesting Falwell's visit because ``he standsagainst reproductive rights. Every time we hear about his being intown, we go out and protest.''   William Adams said he came because ``I am really put off by hisstatements on AIDS being a curse from God. I also happen to be veryreligious. Everything I hear him say comes off as being hate. TheGod I know is about love.''   Falwell said Operation Rescue's adherents ``demonstrate on thebasis of love for unborn children and little mothers-to-be who areabout to do something that will kill their baby and injure thememotionally.''   After the service in this eastern Atlanta suburb, Falwell said hedoes not oppose homosexuals. ``I'm opposed to what they do. I leadgays to Christ every day. Then they change their lifestyle.''</TEXT></DOC>
