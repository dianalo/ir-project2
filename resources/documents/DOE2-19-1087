The primary energy consumptionin the Federal Republic of Germany trebled since 1950 and the share ofimports rose form 6 to 67%. In the same period the world primary energyconsumption quadrupled. In the future the needs will be determined bystagnant consumption in the industrial countries and a rising demandfor energy in the state-trading and in the developing countries.
