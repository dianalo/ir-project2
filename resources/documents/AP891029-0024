The guerrillas claimed 19 people at a wedding party died whenthe government shelled a guerrilla-held area of western Afghanistan.   A spokesman for the Soviet-backed government accused theU.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas of ``cutting supply lines toimpose starvation on the people.''   In the late afternoon, air force planes bombed guerrilla-heldareas in the Paghman mountains, about 15 miles northwest of thecity. The guerrillas fire rockets from these mountains at a Scudmissile base.   The government acknowledged firing Soviet-made Scuds at theSalang highway to drive out guerrillas. The route is the mainsupply road from the Soviet Union to Kabul.   At least 13 rockets hit Kabul on Sunday. One hit the grainmarket in the old section of town, injuring one man. Several otherrockets crashed into residential areas, killing four people, thegovernment said. At least 13 other people were injured.   It was the second straight day of heavy bombardment. More than22 rockets hit the city Saturday.   In Pakistan, where the guerrillas are based, the rebels' MIDIAnews agency said the bride and groom survived the shelling at thewedding Friday but that 19 people, including six children, werekilled.   The agency said the attack occurred near the Shindand air basein Farah province.   Soldiers and doctors at two hospitals said the Scud base was hitnumerous times but they had no reports of casualties. Rockets alsohit the international airport, forcing cancellation of one flightto New Delhi.   On Saturday, the airport was closed because of heavy shelling.   Government soldiers with knowledge of the Salang fighting saidguerrillas were still holding large stretches of the highway on thenorthern slope of the Hindu Kush mountains. Fighting has alsobroken out on the southern slope, they said.   More than 2,000 trucks carrying commodities such as flour andgas for Kabul were said to be stuck on the highway, north of thebattles.   Soldiers also said government troops had been forced to returnto Kabul from a southern road after a convoy of 200 trucks headedfor the embattled southeastern city of Khost was stopped justoutside the capital.   A government official speaking on condition of anonymity saidguerrilla forces captured military positions near Khost, 25 milesfrom the Pakistani border. The government was parachuting insupplies, he said.   In Kabul, streets were nearly empty at times and the usuallybustling bazaars had smaller crowds.   ``I told my family to stay in bed today,'' said one man who wentshopping because there was no food in his house. ``The safest thingto do is sleep.''   Government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said the guerrillas'policy to cut the city's food supplies was ``anti-human andterroristic.''   The guerrillas have said they want to cut off all food and fuelsupplies to Kabul, forcing the people to flee the city. Then, theysay, they will increase their attacks.   Moscow, which sent in troops to back the Marxist government inDecember 1979, finished pulling its troops out in February.</TEXT></DOC>
