Interestedpersons were invited to submit written comments concerning the proposedregulations by September 7, 1988. The Postal Service received one commentfrom the public. The commenter was concerned that the proposed language authorizing inspectionof ``containers'' would permit the examination of items brought onto postalpremises for mailing. That was not the intent of the proposal. Accordingly,to make the intention specific, a sentence is being added to andSection;232.1(b)(1) saying that items brought directly to a postal facility's customermailing acceptance area and deposited in the mail are not subject to inspection,except as provided in section 115 of the Domestic Mail Manual. Section115 of the Domestic Mail Manual, which deals with mail security, generallyprohibits opening and inspection of mail, with certain well-defined exceptions.To clarify the final rule, we are also adopting certain minor and editorialchanges as follows: (1) Proposed andSection; 232.1(b)(1) provided that ``a full search of a personmay accompany an arrest.'' In order to show the reason for the search andthe order in which the events occur, the sentence is revised to read asfollows: ``A person arrested for violation of this section may be searchedincident to the arrest.'' (2) Proposed andSection; 232.1(b)(2) provided (as did preexisting andSection;232.1(b)) that properties must be closed to the public after normal ``working''hours. Working hours in most postal facilities extend beyond normal businesshours. Accordingly, the word ``working'' is changed to ``business'', sothat properties are closed to the public after normal business hours, whichwas the original intent of the regulation. (3) Proposed andSection; 232.1(g) would have prohibited the possession, sale,or use on postal premises of any ``controlled substance'' (except one thatis medically approved). The exception for ``medically approved'' controlledsubstances, which was also in preexisting andSection; 232.1(g), was intendedto permit the possession, sale, or use of such substances when permittedby law. Accordingly, to clarify this provision and extend it to its originalintended application, controlled substances will be prohibited ``exceptwhen permitted by law''. In addition to continuing the exception for substanceswhich are ``medically approved'', this language would apply to other situationsfor which an exception would apply, such as when, for law enforcement purposes,postal inspectors may have controlled substances in their possession whileon postal premises. (4) Proposed andSection; 232.1(g) also carried forward the preexisting absoluteprohibition on the sale or use of any alcoholic beverage on postal premises.The Postal Service is changing this prohibition to allow exceptions forofficial functions. This change will conform the regulation with existingpractice, which permits exceptions to the rule for official functions ifauthorized by the Postmaster General. This exception is also consistentwith the procedure followed by the General Services Administration withregard to the use of intoxicants on United States Government-owned or leasedpremises. See 41 CFR 105-735.219 (1988).(5) Proposed andSection; 232.1(m) added the words ``age (at least 40 yearsof age)'' to the list of prohibited bases for discrimination. The languageis being changed to read: ``age (persons 40 years of age or older are protected)''.This is to clarify that only persons who are age 40 or older are in theprotected class, that is, only such persons could claim that their agewas the reason they were excluded from using or discriminated against intheir use of a public facility. Proposed andSection; 232.1(m) also added the word ``reprisal'' to the listof prohibitions. In order to define the intended meaning of the word, weare adding the following parenthetical phrase after the word reprisal:``(discrimination against a person for having filed or for having participatedin the processing of an EEO complaint_29 CFR 1613.261-.262)''. Except as explained above, the changes are being adopted as proposed. Accordingly,39 CFR Part 232 is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 232 </ITAG>Law enforcement, Postal Service. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 232_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
