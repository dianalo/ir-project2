Sakharov to the ballot for separate elections tothe chamber, official reports said today.   The balloting around the nation Sunday was the second stage ofthe Soviet Union's first multicandidate national elections in 71years.   In the first round March 26, voters rejected at least 45government and Communist Party leaders in their bids for seats inthe new Congress of People's Deputies.   The official news agency Tass said Sakharov, the human rightsactivist who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, was among thosenominated during a meeting of the Academy of Sciences.   Tass said 168 members were proposed as candidates for 12 seatsstill available from the academy and that today's session hadwhittled that number down to 28, including Sakharov and spacescientist Roald Sagdeev.   The nominees will be presented to academy membership forballoting on April 19-21 to choose the 12 deputies, Tass said.   Of 2,250 seats in the congress, 750 were assigned to theCommunist Party and its affiliates as well as social andprofessional organizations like the Academy of Sciences.   Sakharov was previously proposed as a candidate, but anelectoral commission cut him and other well-known reformers fromthe final list in favor of old-guard academy managers. Sakharovsupporters successfully blocked about two-thirds of that slate andforced a second election.   Historian Medvedev, unlike Sakharov, ran in one of the 1,500geographical electoral districts.   Medvedev, whose studies of Stalinism were unpublishable in theSoviet Union until recently, won 52.3 percent of the vote Sunday inhis race in Moscow's Voroshilov district against Ksenya Razumova,head of an atomic research laboratory, district election officialssaid.   The official Tass news agency said writer Yuri Chernichenko alsowon election in his race against philosophy professor Gennady K.Ashin in another Moscow district. It did not give figures.   Chernichenko was a supporter of former Moscow Communist Partyboss Boris N. Yeltsin's successful maverick candidacy and ran on aplatform urging wide-ranging agricultural reform. At an electionrally a week before the election, he said the Soviet Union mustturn from an importer to an exporter of grain.   Tass said 67.1 percent of the voters took part in balloting inMoscow, far below the level of about 90 percent who participatedMarch 26 in the first contested national elections in the SovietUnion in 71 years.   Among the other winners Sunday were Yuri Skokov, director of theKvant scientific conglomerate, who defeated Pyotr Surov in a thirdMoscow district.   The elections in eight Moscow districts were among 64 run-offelections held Sunday throughout the country where more than twocandidates had run March 26 and no one received a majority.   Tass said new elections would be held in 199 of the districts onMay 14. In 195 of them, only one or two candidates ran, but no onereceived a majority.   Among those who lost in uncontested races in the initialballoting were candidate Politburo member Yuri Solovyev inLeningrad and a host of top party officials in Moscow, Leningrad,Kiev and other big cities. More than half the voters in those racesvoted ``no.''</TEXT></DOC>
