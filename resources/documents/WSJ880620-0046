Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corp. He predicts &quot;a series of small credit-tightening moves&quot; by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in coming months.    Unexpectedly strong growth in Japan and West Germany has fueled widespread speculation about credit-tightening moves in those countries soon. U.S. interest rates, which fell sharply earlier this month, lurched back up again late last week.    Rumors that the Federal Reserve is tightening its credit clamp another notch circulated late last week as the federal funds rate climbed to around 7 1/2% from its previous range of around 7 3/8%. The Fed has indicated it's making no significant changes in policy. But the higher rate on funds, or overnight loans between banks, suggests the Fed is willing to err slightly on the side of a tighter policy.    The Fed continues to be reluctant to boost its discount rate, which is the rate it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions. Officials believe that if further tightening is necessary, they can push the federal funds rate higher without taking the bolder step of moving the discount rate. An increase in the discount rate is only likely if the Fed concludes that it is needed to stop a sharp drop in the dollar, or if the central bank decides there is no chance that interest rates will fall in the coming months.    Still, &quot;It's just a matter of time before we see additional steps&quot; by the Federal Reserve and several other central banks to tighten credit, contends Paul W. Boltz, vice president and financial economist at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., a Baltimore-based investment management firm. He predicts that the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, now about 9 1/8%, will climb to 9 1/4% to 9 1/2% over the next month or two.    Investor gloom deepened late last week for several other reasons. Several bond traders blamed part of Friday's bond market slump on a report that a 5% withholding tax on portfolio interest paid to foreigners was on a laundry list of potential revenue-raising tax changes circulated by House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). Although there's no indication that Congress will enact that idea, &quot;that's got to worry foreigners a lot,&quot; says Alan Reynolds, chief economist at Polyconomics Inc., a Morristown, N.J., consulting firm.    Bond prices fell sharply both Thursday and Friday, wiping out all their gains achieved last Tuesday. Prices of some actively traded Treasury bonds, which jumped more than two points Tuesday, finished the week with declines of about 5/8 of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount, compared with June 10. The yield on the Treasury's latest 30-year bonds climbed to 9.10% from 8.98% Thursday and 8.82% as recently as last Tuesday.    &quot;We continue to believe that the cycle peak in interest rates is ahead of us,&quot; said Paul Kasriel, vice president and monetary economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.    &quot;We hate to be repetitious, but our old friends, industrial commodity prices, continue to rise,&quot; Mr. Kasriel wrote in a recent report. Another factor contributing to pressures for higher rates: &quot;We are in the midst of a strong global economic expansion which will put upward pressure on resource prices.&quot;    The recent increase in the federal funds rate &quot;may just be a temporary phenomenon,&quot; Mr. Kasriel continued. &quot;However, with all the talk of central bank tightening abroad, we cannot rule out the possibility that a coordinated rate increase is in the works.&quot;    In Japan, economic growth in the quarter ended March 31 accelerated to the fastest rate in a decade. Gross national product in the fiscal fourth quarter grew at an inflation-adjusted 2.7% from the previous quarter, or at an annualized rate of 11.3%. Meanwhile, speculation also is growing that Britain's base rates will rise again soon.    Central bankers are likely to conclude that working together is easier than taking separate moves, some analysts say. &quot;I would expect to see more cooperation and coordination among central banks because that would give them the courage to take steps together that they individually might not want to risk,&quot; said Mr. Soss of First Boston.    But any credit-tightening moves are likely to be small, Mr. Soss predicts. Fed officials and other central bankers &quot;are more likely to use firecrackers than dynamite,&quot; he says, because &quot;they feel restrained by a sense that the financial system is fragile.&quot;    Central bankers &quot;are very worried about the possibility of another crash,&quot; Mr. Soss says. He adds that the Fed is especially unlikely to take a large credit-tightening step when the presidential campaign is heating up.    Some analysts, such as Mr. Reynolds of Polyconomics, contend that investor fears about inflation are overblown. They say the Commodity Research Bureau futures price index isn't a good indicator of inflation pressures and that the Midwest drought doesn't necessarily spell higher inflation.    &quot;I certainly don't think the Fed should tighten because of soybeans,&quot; Mr. Reynolds says. &quot;We've had a lot of droughts in the past in this country that were not inflationary. The Fed shouldn't target the weather. That's absurd.&quot;    But he and numerous bond traders are increasingly worried about the specter of protectionism and the possibility that this could frighten foreign investors. Protectionist proposals are &quot;very dangerous,&quot; Mr. Reynolds says.    &quot;The bond market has reacted adversely to every move toward protectionism,&quot; Mr. Reynolds continues. &quot;The question is, how many times does Congress have to stick its hands in the meat grinder before it notices it hurts?&quot;    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   For the second day in a row, prices fell sharply. Some long-term Treasury issues dropped about 1 1/2 points, or $15 for each $1,000 face amount.    Traders cited fears that a coordinated round of world-wide interest rate increases may come soon. They also were concerned by the federal funds rate, which averaged 7 1/2% both Thursday and Friday after having hovered around 7 3/8% in previous weeks.    Higher commodity prices contributed to the bond slump. Adding to the market's woes were news reports that House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) circulated a list of potential revenue-raising options that includes a 5% withholding tax on portfolio interest paid to foreign investors. Bond traders fear this, if enacted, would reduce foreign investor participation.    Also, analysts say Congress may take steps soon to increase the Treasury's authority to issue new long-term bonds. If so, that would allow the Treasury to sell its usual amount of 30-year bonds as part of its August financing operation.    The Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 fell to 100 8/32 from 101 15/32 Thursday, 103 2/32 Wednesday and 103 7/32 Tuesday. The government's 9% notes due 1998 declined to 99 30/32 Friday from 100 23/32 Thursday. The yield rose to 9.01% from 8.89%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds dropped 13.38 points to 1229.93. It ranged between 1224.90 and 1240.34. A week earlier, it stood at 1239.43.    Rates rose on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month bill rate rose to 6.37% bid from 6.29% Thursday, while the latest six-month bill rate climbed to 6.68% bid fom 6.59%. </TEXT></DOC>
