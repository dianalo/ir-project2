(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Force on Thursday deniedthat a safety officer mistakenly destroyed a Navy Trident 2submarine missile as a Wisconsin congressman charged.   ``The range safety officer acted within the parameters of themission flight rules by destroying the missile when he did,'' theAir Force said in a statement issued at its Eastern Space andMissile Center here. ``The missile was off course and continued toveer off farther.''   Pentagon sources in Washington indicated the test team mighthave deliberately built an off-course maneuver into the flight pathto see how well the missile's guidance system reacted and that suchinformation may never have been transmitted to the range safetyofficer.   U.S. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee, said in Washington Wednesday, ``There's alwayssomeone who doesn't get the word, and in this incident, it was theman with his finger on the button.''   The Trident 2 was launched Sept. 19 from Cape Canaveral as the15th of 19 test flights planned from a land launch pad before theweapon begins submarine test firings. The missile exploded about 60seconds after liftoff.   Aspin said the safety officer sent a radio signal to blow up themissile when he mistakenly believed it was about to leave the rangesafety corridor.   ``It's the range safety officer's job to allow the missile tofly as long as it can to achieve its test objective, but he alsomust protect the public,'' the Air Force statement said. The AirForce is responsible for safety on the missile test range.   Aspin said in testing thus far, the Trident 2 series shows twooutright failures and one partial success. He said the destructionof the 15th missile was counted as a ``no test'' because themissile did not malfunction.   ``Overall, test results indicate the missile is still meetingits objectives,'' the congressman said.   The Trident 2, capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads todifferent targets, will be the most powerful weapon in the Navyarsenal when it becomes operational late next year. Each Tridentsubmarine carries 24 missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
