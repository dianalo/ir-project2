(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LOOK FOR RELATIONAL TO BE 1990s DATA MODELandM;Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, database management systems were in the&quot;pre-paradigm&quot; phase.andP;  That is, the solutions proposed to data managementproblems were ad hoc, based on a variety of different insights andimplementations.andM;IMS from IBM, IDMS from Cullinet Software, Total from Cincom of Cincinnati,Adabas from Software AG of Reston, Va., and Model 204 from ComputerCorporation of America, Cambridge, Mass., were all different, all with somegood features, all appropriate to some applications.andP;  None, however,sufficiently resonated with user requirements to become a standard acceptedapproach.andP;  Even the attempts of the Codasyl committee to promulgate astandard met with limited success.andM;E.F.andP;  Codd's development of the relational model established a way ofthinking about data management and building DBMSs that became a standardapproach for many.andP;  The past u0 years have moved the relational model fromabstract, academic, and experimental to accepted and basic.andP;  It is today'sparadigm; it is accepted dogma.andM;The industry consensus is that the next five to 10 years will see therefinement of this paradigm--better implementations, faster performance, newfunctionality, extensions to address new problems.andP;  (For the non-consensusview, see related story on page 61.)andM;SQL SPURRED STANDARDS MOVEMENTandM;The overwhelming commercial success of relational DBMSs and SQL as a languagefor database use has resulted in a robust standards movement.andP;  RelationalDBMSs supplied a common data model, which the majority of today's vendorssupport.andP;  The older vendors have for the most part either re-engineered theirDBMSs, moved to smaller niches than general-purpose DBMSs, or simply ceasedto exist as independent vendors.andM;SQL similarly dominates the relational language market.andP;  Ingres' Quel was alanguage that some believed to be technically superior to SQL, but it has allbut disappeared.andP;  Ingres is now SQL-based.andP;  Even Cullinet offered a versionof SQL as part of On-Line Query to use with the Codasyl IDMS.andM;IBM's DB2 has become a de facto standard.andP;  To many independent softwarevendors it is more important to be compatible with IBM than with the Ansistandard.andP;  IBM's oft-repeated statement that it will comply with stnadardsmakes this easier to do, although it has some way to go.andP;  In fact.andP;  IBM isahead of the standard with its implementation of referential integrity.andM;In 1986, the American National Standards Institute gave us Ansi86 SQL, andmodified it in 1989 to the current specification, Ansi89.andP;  All the relationalvendors today support SQL, and profess a commitment to it.andP;  Yet all SQLs aredifferent.andP;  Will the standards movement change that?andM;Ken Jacobs, director of RDBMS marketing for Oracle Corp. in Belmont, Calif.,andO;is a member of the Ansi SQL committee.andP;  He points out that standards areextremely important to provide interoperability in heterogeneousenvironments.andP;  He adds that no DBMS today is in conformity with Ansi86 orAnsi89.andM;TEST SUITE DUE IN SPRINGandM;However, in the spring the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST, formerly the National Bureau of Standards) will issue a test suite forSQL compliance with the Ansi89 standard that will flag all non-standard SQLwith warning messages.andM;By making the claim of standards conformity verifiable, this test suite willhelp push vendors toward the standard.andP;  Indeed, Oracle is committed to havingits release 7 pass the test suite.andM;Vendors are quick to point out, however, that conformance to the standard isjust a starting point because the current standard does not support necessaryfunctions such as referential actions or outer joins.andP;  These are likely to beamong the additions of Ansi2, which should be available for public review inthe first half of this year.andM;The SQL standard will likely be a minimum to which vendors conform.andP;  Theywill continue to seek advantage through extensions designed to address theneeds of their customers.andM;Client-server architectures became important in the 1980s, and now the majortrend in client-server computing is for the front-end tools to migrate to thePC, where graphical user interfaces (GUIs) provide a vechile for improvedfront ends.andM;The need to communicate with a variety of host DBMSs, especially IBM's DB2,has motivated independent software vendors to support interoperability.andP;  Inthe past, mainframe products such as Software AG's Natural and CA-Cullinet'sGenerator worked only with the vendors' own DBMS (Adabas and IDMSrespectively).andM;Today, fourth-generation languages and application development tools arebeing ported to work with DB2 and other proprietary DBMSs.andM;LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDandM;What makes this difficult today is not only the lack of standardization inSQL, but the lack of a communications standard.andM;Roger Sippl, president of Menlo Park, Calif.-based Informix Corp., is thechairman of the SQL Access Group.andP;  Fourteen companies, including Informix,Ingres, and Oracle, formed this group last year to expedite the developmentof a DBMS communications standard that is suited to building products.andP;  Thevendors work with other standards groups, including the Ansi SQL committeeand the Remote Data Access group.andM;However, many cannot wait for the completion of a standard, so vendors aremoving ahead.andP;  Consequently, Oracle has SQLConnect, Sybase has its remoteprocedure call interface, Ingress its General Communication Architecture, andApple its CL/1.andM;Perhaps the furthest along in connectivity to a variety of different hostDBMSs is Information Builders, Inc. of New York.andP;  Its Focus DBMS andfourth-generation language provides gateways to a wide variety of relationaland non-relational DBMSs, in both a single common host architecture andclient-server architecture.andM;In the future, standards are likely to form a common ground between softwarevendors' products, from which they will innovate based on what they eachbelieves is best for their customers.andM;Bob Epstein, executive vice president of Sybase, Inc., Emeryville, Calif.,andO;says the client-server will evolve beyond its focus on the DBMS as the serverthat provides data to a front-end application.andM;In the future, complex applciations, which may use a database, will be theserver that provides more than simple data to front ends.andM;Distributed database is closely related to the client-server model.andP;  Forexample, a network may have multiple servers.andP;  True distributed database, inits simplest form, means that while the data may reside in a variety ofdatabases, the user or program sees the data as if it were in a singledatabase (also known as the single image model).andM;No one delivers this kind of distributed database today, although manyvendors deliver parts of it.andP;  Oracle has distributed retrieval, Ingres andInformix optimize joins across databases, and Sybase, Interbase, and Ingressupport two-phase commit.andP;  (Two-phase commit ensures data integrity fordistributed database transactions.)andM;EXTEND FUNCTIONALITYandM;Among the vendors interviewed for this article, most said they will extendthe functionality they now have to more fully solve the problem.andM;However, I teach seminars in the U.S.andP;  and Europe on distributed database,and in the dozens of companies that send representatives, only a handful needfull-distributed database to solve their problems (although all would likeit).andM;When I asked about user demand the vendors all replied that there was someinterest, but not a great deal.andP;  In fact, Norris van den Berg, manager ofData Systems Architectures at IBM's Santa Teresa Laboratories, San Jose,Calif., said that for the IBM customer advisory council, asynchronoussnapshots capability, which does not try to keep duplicated data consistent,was more important than distributed transaction processing.andP;  (Asynchronoussnapshots take an image of a portion of a central database and then send theimage to remote databases.)andM;It will be quite a while before high performance, reliable, full distributeddatabase is available.andP;  Even though vendors are moving toward shippingsoftware, without large commitments and use of distributed databasetechnology by users, there will only be slow improvement.andM;Many DBMS vendors recognize the importance of handling complex data types,such as text, image, voice, or documents.andP;  (Some vendors call theseBlobs--Binary or Basic Large Objects).andM;These data types, along with stored procedures and triggers, are part of theprogression toward capturing more application semantics in the databaseitself.andP;  It also may be among the first steps toward object-oriented DBMS.andO;Jim Starkey, president of Bedford, Mass.-based Interbase Corp., sees theability to efficiently store and process these data types as a critical stepin dealing with the increasing variety of complex applications inengineering, science, and office automation.andP;  Interbase itself uses Blobs tomanage their DBMS source code.andM;While industry observers concur that object orientation will becomeincreasingly important, they express mixed feelings as to whetherobject-oriented DBMSs will be extensions of current relational technology.andM;Paul Newton, president of Ingres Corp., Menlo Park, Calif., believes thatobject orientation will be an extension of current relational products.andP;  Inparticular, an object-oriented DBMS needs to work with operational data.andO;Sippl of Informix says that these kinds of extensions work well withobject-oriented programming language extensions to 4GLs.andM;Not surprisingly, the vendors of object-oriented DBMSs see big differences inwhat the relational vendors do and the requirements of object-oriented DBMSs.andM;Jacob Stein, a senior engineer with Alameda, Calif.-based Servio Logic,points out that object manipulation is inherently not set-oriented.andP;  The verystrengths of relational DBMSs and SQL are frequently irrelevant, and at worstcan result in poor performance.andM;To work with operational data, the best way may be to build interfaces torelational DBMSs such as the one Servio Logic is developing for Sybase.andM;AI, EXPERT SYSTEM INTEGRATIONandM;Artificial intelligence and expert systems integration is an area in whichmost vendors are cautious.andP;  Newton of Ingres sees AI as applicable todatabase internals, such as optimizing database access, but of limitedutility in applications development.andM;Information Builders is more optimistic than most.andP;  They see increasedintegration of their expert systems product, Level 5, and its 4GL and DBMS,Focus.andM;Up to this point, we've looked at technology trends.andP;  But what about themarket?andP;  Will your favorite DBMS vendor be in business five years from now?andM;In particular, IBM's dominance of the MVS DBMS market, and the disappearanceinto Computer Associates of two previous stars (Cullinet's IDMS and AppliedData Research's Datacom/DB) are a legitimate cause for concern.andM;John Cullinane, formerly chairman of Cullinet Software Inc., is now aBusiness Fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge,Mass.andP;  For years his company successfully competed with IBM's IMS bydifferentiating itself (for example, Cullinet's emphasis on integrated datadictionaries) and offering good technology.andP;  But the speedy acceptance of therelational model, coupled with increasing saturation of the MVS DBMS market,didn't give them enough time to complete their technical transition.andM;George van Schaick, formerly of Cullinet, is now vice president ofInformation Management Software Marketing at Computer Associates in GardenCity, N.Y.andP;  He oversees what seems to be the completion of Cullinet'sstrategy coupled with ADR's product offerings.andM;The effort is based on the high-level Enterprise Generator technology, whichuses a requirements specification to target third-generation languages suchas Cobol, or 4GLs such as Ideal, another product from ADR.andP;  The CA front-endtools will work with DB2 as well as CA's own DBMSs.andM;STAYING CLOSE TO DB2andM;According to Jeff Stokoe, senior product manager for Supra at Cincom, the keyto Supra's success is strict DB2 compatibility while using fewer systemresources.andP;  Even the SQL return codes are the same.andP;  This is particularlyimportant to the non-MVS user.andP;  Because Supra runs on VAXs, mixed ships cantake advantage of compatibility.andP;  Cincom is also developing full-distributeddatabase capability.andM;Software AG also sees the need to work with DB2 on MVS, according to TomWilde, vice president of product marketing.andP;  Its Natural 4GL supports DB2 aswell as its own DBMS, Adabas.andM;The company believes it needs to provide compatibility with DB2, but also tosupply non-relational functionality to meet the needs of some customers.andP;  Forexample, the company will support non-normalized data structures, and add anentity-relationship layer called Adabas Entire.andM;Richard Winter, vice president of technology for Computer Corporation ofAmerica, sees the future in target markets in which CCA can solve specificapplication needs.andM;Typically, the rapid multi-key access of CCA's Model 204 is necessary.andP;  Thecompany has been so successful in helping clients build direct marketingapplications that it has introduced a Model 204-based package called MarketPulse.andP;  CCA positions this as an application package, not a database product.andM;Epstein points to an interesting problem, &quot;How can vendors deal with thedownsizing of hardware?&quot;andM;It is perfectly reasonable to build an application requiring gigabytes ofdata and dozens of active users on computers costing well under $100,000.andO;These were former mainframe-scale applications.andP;  A mainframe DBMS vendor hadno difficulty charging $250,000 or more for software to run on a multimilliondollar mainframe.andP;  But a vendor cannot charge five times the price of thehardware for the DBMS.andM;How are vendors going to sell their systems and provide the support thatcustomers have come to expect?andM;The answer to this question may have more influence on the use of DBMSs thanany technology change.andM;How far ahead can we predict?andM;Ten years ago, few people, if any, were predicting the rise in power of themicrocomputer and its spread throughout the company.andP;  A few visionaries werepredicting that the relational model and SQL would be the wave of the future,and aptly named Oracle successfully built its company on that insight.andM;Are object-oriented DBMSs, a new paradigm, the successor to the relationalmodel?andP;  And a company like Servio Logic the next Oracle?andP;  Perhaps.andM;A more likely scenario is that the intensity of competition in the DBMSmarket will keep all the current contenders looking for a technological edge,so that evolution will come from the trends that are in place now, ratherthan from revolution.andP;  But, no one knows.andM;In Santa Fe, N.M., a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist is puttingthe finishing touches on a self-extending organic neural net computer thatorganizes data based on the information required from it.andP;  By constantlymonitoring usage patterns, the database is self re-organizing.andM;The storage mechanism is holographic, with the fully parallel access andredundancy that it implies.andP;  The interface is directly connected to yourmind, so that you only need to think of what you want, and the answer appearsin the appropriate format (even paper).andM;Edelstein is a principal of Euclid Associates, Berkeley, Calif., a firm whichdoes consulting work for both vendors and users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
