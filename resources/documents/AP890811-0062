Scientists from the National Public Health and HospitalInstitute in Washington, D.C., surveyed 623 hospitals in 1987 andfound that AIDS patients are concentrated in major city hospitals,causing serious financial loss, according to a study published intoday's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association.   The study said the average cost for in-patient care of an AIDSvictim was $681 a day, while the average revenue the hospitalreceived for such care was $545 a day.   ``These hospitals are losing large amounts of money. It's eatinginto their bottom line,'' Virginia Weslowski, one of theresearchers, said in a telephone interview Thursday.   The federal government could give the financially troubledhospitals emergency grants and put more money into Medicaid forAIDS patients, said Dennis Andrulis, principal researcher of thestudy.   Ms. Weslowski said the government could ease the burden on thehospitals by allowing more patients to qualify for Medicaid.   The researchers found that the burden of caring for AIDSpatients falls on only a few public hospitals in cities like NewYork, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Miami.   Less than 5 percent of U.S. hospitals treat more than 50 percentof all AIDS cases, the study found.   For every dollar public hospitals spend on AIDS outpatients, thehospitals get back only 14 cents, Andrulis said.   If an AIDS patient is not covered by Medicaid or healthinsurance, public hospitals must swallow the costs themselves, hesaid.   ``This will overwhelm the hospitals and hurt the quality of carefor the other patients,'' Ms. Weslowski said.   She added that public hospitals are especially hard hit by thedeadly disease because they attract heavy concentrations of poorvictims, many of them inner-city drug abusers.   On the average, public hospitals treated more than twice as manyAIDS patients as private hospitals, researchers found. They alsotreated the largest proportions of low-income AIDs patients acrossall regions.   Even middle- or upper-middle-class AIDS patients can end up inpublic hospitals when they are unable to work, deplete or loseinsurance benefits and and have used up their financial resourcestrying to cover medical costs, Ms. Weslowski said.   Anne Scitovsky, chief of the economics division of the Palo AltoMedical Foundation in California, blamed the problem on thenation's ``inadequate health insurance system.''   An estimated 37 million Americans have no health insurance, shesaid.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal, incurabledisease that cripples the body's defenses, leaving a person prey tolife-threatening infections and certain cancers. The syndrome isspread by a virus that is spread mainly through sexual intercourse,shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to theirinfants before or during birth.   By June 30, AIDS had stricken more than 99,936 people in theUnited States since 1979 and killed more than 58,014 of them,according to the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
