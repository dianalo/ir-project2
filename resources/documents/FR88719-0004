Before this time, pursuant to a previous resolution creating theclass of preferred stock covered by the July 13 action, such stock couldonly be held by stockholders of a Federal Home Loan Bank, a Federal HomeLoan Bank in connection with collateral for advances, the FSLIC in connectionwith the receivership or insolvency of a holder of the preferred stock,a pre-approved market maker or nominee thereof, or a specialist on anynational securities exchange. Additionally, single holders of such preferredstock were limited in the maximum amount of shares each could hold to 150,000.Freddie Mac's Board of Directors also acted on July 13, 1988 to increasesequentially the maximum number of shares that any single holder couldown from 150,000 to 6000,000 by January 1, 1989.Currently, Freddie Mac preferred stock is primarily held by the approximately3,000 insured institutions that own stock in the Federal Home Loan Banks.In general, the Board believes that any decision to purchase or sell FreddieMac stock both before and after January 1, 1989, is best left to the soundbusiness judgment of insured institutions themselves. The Board is concerned,however, with the possible effect of the removal of the restrictions onownership and transferability of Freddie Mac preferred stock on those insuredinstitutions not currently meeting their minimum regulatory capital requirementas set forth in 12 CFR 563.13 and 563.14. These institutions require closersupervision as a result of their impaired capital position.The Board has therefore determined to require that such institutions obtainthe approval of their PSA or his designee, subject to the concurrence ofthe Office of Regulatory Activities, before buying or selling any of theshares of Freddie Mac preferred stock they now hold or may later acquire.This restriction is similar to restrictions the Board has imposed on suchinstitutions in other contexts. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>12 CFR 563.4 (brokered deposits), 12 CFR 563.9-8(c)(2)(iii)(equity risk investments). In so acting, the Board believed, as it doestoday, that the impaired capital status of such insured institutions warrantsparticular supervisory scrutiny of certain business decisions. The PSAfor the institution is best able to determine whether an institution'sdecision to purchase or sell Freddie Mac preferred stock may have adverseconsequences for the institution and ultimately the FSLIC as insurer ofthe institution.The Board believes that the elimination of the ownership and transferabilityrestrictions that had previously applied to Freddie Mac preferred stockmay subject the value of those securities to increased market fluctuations.This could, in turn, have a significant impact on the financial conditionof insured institutions holding such stock. To the extent that institutionscan immediately increase their holdings of Freddie Mac preferred stock,the results of potential market fluctuations in the value of this stocktake on more significant consequences.With the removal of the previous Freddie Mac restriction significantlylimiting the amount any single holder of preferred stock could own, insuredinstitutions can immediately double their holdings of Freddie Mac preferredstock. At the same time, the value of this stock will be subject to unprecedentedvolatility. The capital position of institutions that are not presentlymeeting their minimum capital requirement may be particularly vulnerableto these variations. The Board believes that before such institutions cansignificantly alter their holdings of Freddie Mac preferred stock, theremust be an opportunity for the institution's Principal Supervisory Agentto evaluate the potential impact resulting from a change in the level ofthis type of investment. Although the Freddie Mac action does not contemplatethat this preferred stock will be available for sale to the public untilJanuary 1, 1989, in the interim the Board recognizes that intra-industrypurchases and sales among institutions with impaired capital could detrimentallyaffect the sound operation of such institutions.The temporary rule that the Board adopts today will prevent institutionsthat do not meet their minimum regulatory capital requirement under andSection;andSection;563.13 and 563.14 from buying or selling Freddie Mac preferred stock withoutfirst obtaining written approval from their PSA.The rule requires that institutions not meeting their minimum capital requirementmust submit written applications to their PSAs. It sets forth factors tobe considered by the PSAs when evaluating an institution's applicationto buy or sell Freddie Mac preferred stock. In making a written applicationto buy or sell Freddie Mac preferred stock, institutions will be requiredto demonstrate the effect that the proposed transaction will have on theiroverall asset composition. Factors that are to be addressed in applicationsinclude, but are not limited to, the effect proposed transactions willhave on an institution's future growth, its risk exposure, and portfoliodiversification. The PSA may require an institution to include in its applicationany additional information that the PSA may consider relevant to evaluatingportfolio risk in connection with the purchase or sale of Freddie Mac preferredstock. If the institution proposes to sell its shares of Freddie Mac preferredstock, it must indicate in its application the manner in which the resultingproceeds are to be used. Moreover, it must comply with any conditions imposedby the PSA. All institutions not meeting their minimum capital requirementthat sell shares of Freddie Mac preferred stock may, at the discretionof the PSA, be further restricted from declaring dividends for the yearsin which the gain on such sales are recognized until an amount equivalentto such gain is subtracted from the institution's earnings. Any waiversgranted by the PSA with respect to other dividend restrictions will notapply to this dividend restriction.Although the Board has determined that immediate action is required toensure that institutions failing their regulatory capital requirement buyand sell Freddie Mac stock consistent with principles of safety and soundness,the Board also believes that public comment on today's rule will be usefulin shaping any permanent rule that it may determine to adopt upon expirationof this temporary rule. It therefore requests public comment on the temporaryregulation adopted today. Comments received will be taken into accountin determining the scope of any final regulation that the Board may adopt.The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), (d)(3), provides thatthe general provisions requiring notice and comment and a delay in theeffective date of a substantive regulation do not apply when an agencydetermines that the public interest would not be served by notice and commentbefore agency action and that good cause for depensing with the delay ineffective date exists and is published with the rule. As set forth elsewherein this <T2>supplementary information,</T2> the Board believes that in order topreserve its ability to supervise institutions with impaired capital adequatelyits Principal Supervisory Agents must be able to act promptly to monitorthe decision by any such institution to purchase or sell Freddie Mac preferredstock. It anticipates that it will have adequate time, during the periodthis temporary rule is in effect, to review any comments received duringthe comment period and any other supervisory information regarding theseinstitutions to determine the most effective way of affording such institutionsmanagerial flexibility in this area consistent with the Board's supervisoryconcerns. The Board therefore finds that good cause exists for dispensingwith a delayed effective date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis: 1. <T3>Need for and objectives of the rule.</T3> These elements are incorporatedabove in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>. 2. <T3>Issues raised by comments and agency assessment and response.</T3>These elements will be considered by the Board in reviewing any commentsreceived and will be fully addressed in any final regulation. 3. <T3>Significant alternatives minimizing small-entity impact and agencyresponse.</T3> The Small Business Administration defines a small financialinstitution as ``a commercial bank or savings and loan association, theassets of which, for the preceding fiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.''13 CFR 121.13(a). This temporary regulation will only affect those smallsavings and loan associations that are not currently meeting their regulatorycapital requirements. The Board believes that the temporary rule providesthe least burdensome alternative available for addressing the Board's supervisoryconcern about the safe and sound operation of such insured institutionsin this area. The Board will consider any alternatives presented in commentsaddressing this concern. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 563</ITAG>Bank deposit insurance, Investments, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Savings and loan associations. <ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 563_OPERATIONS</ITAG>1.
