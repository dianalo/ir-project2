Grace andamp; Co., only a month before selling its restaurant group to company insiders, paid $4.2 million to buy four restaurants from the son of its chairman, according to proxy material for the company's annual meeting.    The proxy describes J. Peter Grace III, son of J. Peter Grace, chairman and chief executive officer of the chemical company, as a &quot;principal shareholder&quot; in the four Mexican-style restaurants. It doesn't disclose whether he profited from the sale. The younger Mr. Grace couldn't be reached for comment.    A spokesman at Grace headquarters here said the elder Mr. Grace excluded himself from all internal discussions concerning the purchase of his son's restaurants. The spokesman added the company received $4.2 million for the four restaurants when they were sold as part of the $435.9 million leveraged buyout of the company's restaurant group in December.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    The Grace spokesman said the company, which operated several Mexican restaurant chains, bought the four restaurants because of their locations. The spokesman added the younger Mr. Grace approached the company in early 1986 about having it buy the properties. </TEXT></DOC>
