On board diagnosis was therefore introduced at BMW as ameans of exact location of faults. All electronic control equipmentswhich are built up with a micro-computer, are connected via a two wireline, and can be scanned for faults by a service tester. The data aretransmitted serially, where the design is such that the information canbe transmitted at fixed transmission speeds and with variable baud rates.The on board diagnosis therefore makes a considerable contribution toa comprehensive integrated service concept.</TEXT></DOC>
