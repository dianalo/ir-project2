Extends Its Bid For Federated --- Deadline is Pushed to Friday Amid Signs of Slowdown With Bank Negotiations </HL><AUTHOR> Jacquie McNish (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CMAFC FDS </CO><IN> TNM RET </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> TORONTO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Campeau Corp. extended the deadline on its proposal for a friendly merger with Federated Department Stores Inc. amid signs of a slowdown in negotiations for its bank financing.    Some sources close to Campeau said its financing talks have hit a temporary snag because its chairman and chief executive officer, Robert Campeau, is reluctant to pay more than $20 million in additional bank fees that are required to secure short-term loans for its bid. Mr. Campeau's resistance delays the completion of financing that could be needed to win Federated's support for the $66-a-share bid. Federated's board rejected Campeau's offers because it said they lack necessary financing.    But so far, there isn't any indication that the financing could fall apart and other Campeau sources indicated that talks with banks have slowed largely because of the administrative strains posed by coordinating more than $3 billion in loans with a syndicate of banks.    Campeau said it extended until midnight Friday the deadline for Federated to accept its bid to enter a definitive merger at $66 a share. Campeau's previous deadline expired Sunday.    The Toronto-based real estate developer and retailer also has a hostile tender offer outstanding to acquire Federated for $61 a share, or a total $5.47 billion, but most of Campeau's financing commitments are contingent on a friendly takeover.    The new deadline gives Campeau more time to consider new financing strategies before the next meeting of Federated's board, set for Thursday.    In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Federated's stock closed at $60.75, up 50 cents.    Sources close to Mr. Campeau said he opposes more bank fees at this stage because he has already paid more than $20 million to obtain financing commitments for about $1.6 billion in equity from its adviser First Boston Corp. and Bank of Montreal and Banque Paribas. The fees are paid regardless of the success of Campeau's bid.    Campeau sources said the new fees shouldn't be necessary to win Federated's support, because Campeau has already proposed to make a large deposit with Federated if it accepts its friendly merger offer.    Despite Mr. Campeau's resistance to new fees, one source indicated the executive may have little choice but to &quot;bite the bullet and pay the fees&quot; if Federated continues to oppose its bid.    Campeau has been unable to secure much financing for its hostile tender offer because of anti-takeover measures recently adopted by Federated's board. Federated's amended shareholder rights plan would permit holders of rights to buy Federated stock at a discount should anyone acquire 15% of the company's shares and a majority of outside directors agree that such ownership isn't in its best interests.    A spokesman for Federated said the company wouldn't comment on Campeau's extension of its $66-a-share offer.    Meanwhile, Federated's board deferred until 11:59 p.m. EST Thursday the separation of the so-called poison-pill shareholder rights defensive plan.    Separately, Federal Judge Carl B. Rubin in Cincinnati ruled unconstitutional a law passed last week by the Ohio Legislature aimed at thwarting Campeau's hostile bid for Federated.    Judge Rubin, in his ruling on the Foreign Business Acquisition Act, said &quot;a state may not enact laws which discriminate against foreign commerce or which may adversely affect interstate commerce by creating a risk of inconsistent state legislation.&quot;    The judge barred the state from enforcing the statute.    Campeau had claimed the law would affect its ability to line up financing for the takeover bid. It sought a restraining order after Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste signed the measure into law. </TEXT></DOC>
