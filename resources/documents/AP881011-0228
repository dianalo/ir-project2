Although the Democratic nominee speaks Spanish, the Dukakiscampaign only recently has begun scrambling to deal with what someobservers say is a dangerous lack of local organizing and hishalf-hearted, post-primary courting of Hispanics in California.   ``At this moment it (the Hispanic vote) is in jeopardy,'' saidRuben Bonilla, director of the Mexican-American DemocraticPolitical Action Committee. ``There are certain things that need tobe done, and we're in danger of running out of time.''   At the same time, Bush's own Hispanic initiative hasn't lived upto his Republican supporters' expectations, and has been weakenedby highly publicized comments by the vice president that someHispanic leaders found offensive.   ``Everyone's angry _ the Latino Democrats and Republicans,''said Richard Santillan, a professor at California State PolytechnicUniversity at Pomona.   ``Both campaigns are doing the same thing _ taking the Hispanicvote for granted,'' he said.   At stake in the Hispanic community, ironically, are enough votesto tip the balance of victory in a close contest.   In the past 12 years, rapid population growth and massive voterregistration efforts have nearly tripled the number of eligibleHispanic voters. More than half of all Hispanics live inCalifornia, Texas and New Mexico, which together carry 81 electoralvotes, or 30 percent of the 270 electoral votes needed to win thepresidency.   Pollsters say the presidential races in California and perhapsin Texas may come down to margins of about 100,000 votes eitherway. Hispanic groups have registered 100,000 new voters inCalifornia and 70,000 in Texas this year.   Hispanics already are credited with providing victory marginsfor Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., in 1986, and for Dukakis on the``Super Tuesday'' primary in Texas.   But to provide the margin of victory over Bush, who leads inmost polls, analysts say Dukakis would have to win upwards of 75percent of a large Hispanic turnout. Bush is seeking at leastone-third of the vote or else a low turnout.   Hispanics traditionally have low turnout rates in presidentialelections. Excitement about Dukakis and the prospect of helping todecide a close race led experts to predict record numbers ofHispanics casting ballots on Nov. 8.   Those predictions may now be in doubt. In poorer Hispanicneighborhoods, which usually are Democratic strongholds, the key towinning is effective door-to-door campaigning, high-profile ralliesand workable get-out-the-vote machinery. There also must be a closerace, where Hispanics believe their votes can make a difference.   ``The burden really is on Dukakis to convince people, and forhis machine to get people to come out and vote,'' said Cal Tech'sSantillan, an expert on voting trends and ethnic studies. ``I don'tknow if he's been able to do that.''   Said Richard Martinez, California director of the non-partisanSouthwest Voter Registration Education Project:   ``The longer they wait, the more options they cut off. The keyfor the Democrats is, are you going to be smart enough to make theinvestment and get out that 75 percent you need? Are you going toplay your Hispanic card?''   Bush has tried to corral Hispanic voters by stressing his standsfor a strong military and against abortion and crime, and pointingto the Reagan administration's new Hispanic education secretary,Lauro Cavazos.   The vice president is targeting middle-class neighborhoods whichare more likely to vote Republican.   Bush's efforts have been hampered by several incidents that manyHispanics regard as mistakes. One was when he referred to hisHispanic grandchildren as ``the little brown ones.''   Another was when he told students at an East Los Angeles highschool renowned for its high rate of college-bound graduates that``you don't have to go to college to be a success. We need thosepeople who build our buildings, who send them soaring into thesky.''   Dukakis hasn't campaigned in the Hispanic stronghold of SouthTexas since July. Bonilla and other South Texas leaders complainthey don't have access to the Massachusetts governor's topadvisers, who don't understand the Hispanic community even though``they cast their whole fortunes in Texas with the Hispaniccommunity.''   In California, campaigning was so laggardly that a group oflocal elected officials who support Dukakis demanded a meeting withhis state campaign officials to plead for action. Result: animmediate bolstering of the campaign staff in the primary Hispanicbattleground in East Los Angeles.   ``We stepped in and said if you're committed to more than asymbolic Hispanic campaign, then you should have in place a strongget-out-the-vote effort,'' said Los Angeles City CouncilwomanGloria Molina.   ``In other areas, I think it may only be a superficialcampaign,'' she said. ``In our area, we stepped in. There's stilltime for the Dukakis campaign to put that network in place.''   Dukakis met privately with about two dozen Texas Hispanicleaders during a late September trip to Dallas. Four days later,Bonilla was contacted to tape Hispanic radio ads for the Democraticnominee.   Richard Ybarra, chief of Hispanic strategy for the Dukakiscampaign, said he is counting on local leaders to energize theircommunities because Dukakis cannot appear everywhere at once.   ``He has to go to places targeted for improvement,'' Ybarrasaid. ``It's up to us to get our job done. We'll be spending moreadvertising money in the Hispanic community than our party has everbefore, and it will be more effective than ever before.''   Some prominent Hispanic leaders, like Mayor Henry Cisneros ofSan Antonio, Texas, are campaigning hard as Dukakis surrogates.   ``I see a lot of excitement,'' the mayor said. ``People havebeen out of power long enough now, and they sense that thiselection makes a difference.''   Door-to-door voter registration and leafleting is more intensethan ever in some communities, notably San Antonio.   Dukakis aides say running mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a native ofSouth Texas who is popular among Hispanics, gives the campaign alogistical and emotional boost in Texas.   Observers say some of the complaints may stem from Dukakis'showing in public opinion polls which place him as much as 10percentage points behind Bush in Texas, the vice president'sadopted home state, and slightly behind in California.   Whoever wins, and whatever role Hispanics play, local organizerssay the campaign has been good for Hispanics' emergence as apolitical power.   The Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project will haveits most productive voter registration drive in any presidentialelection year since it was founded in 1974, said director AndyHernandez.   ``I think the fact that so much attention has been paid to theHispanic vote has tended to create more momentum,'' Hernandez said.   ``I think it is watershed election for us. From now on, no onecan think about winning the presidency or the governorship withoutHispanics being a critical element in there,'' he said.   ``The fact is, we are now part of the equation. Even before theelection takes place, we've already arrived.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 16</NOTE></DOC>
