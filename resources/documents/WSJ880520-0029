Terms of the agreement haven't been finalized, but it is expected that Aerojet would design, develop and produce the rocket while Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co. would do systems engineering and integration.    In December, Atlantic Research Corp., a maker of propulsion and communications systems, and Hercules Inc., a chemical and aerospace concern, teamed to bid for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration contract. NASA is expected to award the contract, valued at nearly one billion dollars, by next spring. Morton Thiokol Inc. currently builds the shuttle's solid propellant motors. </TEXT></DOC>
