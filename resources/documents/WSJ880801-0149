Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MDEST </CO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Iran-Iraq war appears to be winding down, but it leaves a grisly battlefield legacy: the widespread use of chemical weapons, which played a significant role in the outcome.    Iraq -- and to a lesser extent Iran -- openly used these fearsome weapons without more than token protest from the rest of the world. Indeed, the U.S., which loudly denounces chemical weapons use, upgraded diplomatic relations with Baghdad in 1984 even though it knew Iraq had introduced these weapons to the fight. And, despite mounting concern, negotiations are stalled over a new international chemical-weapons treaty.    Since the end of World War I, the taboo against chemical warfare -- embodied in the 1925 Geneva Protocol -- has been the main element that has prevented proliferation. But now, U.S. analysts fear, every low-budget conflict could become a theater for the deployment of gas, a weapon that is inexpensive and deadly.    &quot;The bottom line is the genie is out of the bottle,&quot; frets a State Department official. &quot;The unfortunate but realistic lesson learned is that these things are pretty cheap to make and can be delivered through relatively unsophisticated methods.&quot;    What is more, it is almost impossible to monitor or control the production of chemical weapons. Experts say almost any facility that produces fertilizer, for example, can make these weapons. Production doesn't require an indispensable ingredient, such as the plutonium or enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons, that can be closely controlled. Rather, chemical weapons are made from a variety of dualuse substances.    &quot;There is very little prospect that you can do anything practical to prevent countries that want to produce it from getting the material to produce it,&quot; concludes Douglas Feith, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who specialized in chemical-weapons negotiations.    Mr. Feith says Western nations must share the blame for the current dilemma. He says that when the Soviet Union and its allies were first accused of using chemical and biological weapons in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia, the debate focused on the quality of the evidence against Moscow, rather than the issue of chemical weapons use. &quot;Iraq seems to have registered that lesson,&quot; Mr. Feith adds. &quot;They appear to have concluded that from a cost-benefit analysis the political risk is zero.&quot;    Indeed, despite the concern over proliferation, negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, over a 1984 U.S. proposal banning possession and production of chemical weapons are stalled. The 40 nations considering the ban can't agree over verification measures, and major powers, including the U.S. and Soviet Union, are wary of signing an agreement unless all nations are bound to the same restrictions.    This year, Third World members wanted to insert a clause in the proposed treaty requiring development assistance for their chemical industries from the industrialized powers as the price for their agreement to a chemical-weapons ban. They argued that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty contains such a clause.    &quot;People no longer think a treaty is imminent, given the complex issues involved,&quot; says a U.S. arms-control official.    Iraq initiated the use of chemical weapons in its war with Iran, but until recently the impact wasn't great because Baghdad was on the defensive and worried that if it used chemicals to stop Iranian attacks, a shift in the wind could jeopardize Iraqi troops. But last spring, when Iraq regained the Faw peninsula in the first of four successful offensive thrusts, chemical weapons played a major role, U.S. analysts say. Iraq deployed the weapons to bombard Iranian command and control centers, to disrupt Iran's military operations and to soften up front-line Iranian troops before Iraqi soldiers moved in.    In March, Iraq used chemical weapons on the civilian Kurdish population of Halabja within its own borders and reportedly killed more than 4,000 people in response to a major attack by Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Kurdish guerrillas, who penetrated 30 miles into Iraq. Such attacks left deep psychological scars on Iranian troops, U.S. officials say.    But the war's legacy is that Iraq turned the tide and now doesn't apologize for its use of chemical weapons. According to U.S. officials, Iraqis say they were fighting for their survival. Under such conditions, the Iraqis asserted, they don't see the West's moral distinction between killing with bullets and killing with chemicals. </TEXT></DOC>
