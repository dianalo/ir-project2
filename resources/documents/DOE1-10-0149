In Canada, traditional biomass conversion methods are beingre-examined and new processes developed. The Bioenergy Development Programis playing a key role in the emergence of bioenergy technologies by assistingCanadian industries to develop new and better systems and equipment.Bioenergy encourages self-sufficiency and helps protect Canadians frompotential oil supply disruptions and price fluctuations. Canada is fortunatein having a varied, abundant biomass resource base on which to builda future in bioenergy technologies. While forests are the greatest sourceof biomass, other important sources include agricultural residues, municipaland industrial process wastes, peat and aquatic biomass. The BioenergyDevelopment Program has identified six priority areas within their R,Dandamp;Dprogram: materials preparation and handling, direct combustion, conversionto liquid fuels, conversion to gaseous fuels, conversion to chemicalfeedstocks, and environmental considerations. This document providesan overview of Canadian accomplishments in the field, assessing boththe status and potential of the various technologies.</TEXT></DOC>
