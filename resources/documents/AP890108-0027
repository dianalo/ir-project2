The protesters were among about 1,000 people who attended a rallyin downtown Seoul, denouncing what they called ``mercilesssuppression'' of labor movements by the government of President RohTae-woo.   ``Get rid of Roh,'' protesters shouted as they marched after thetwo-hour rally. Police detained at least three people.   Protesters charged the Roh government had begun a crackdown onlabor as part of its effort to hold onto power.   The marchers, blocked by hundreds of police at an intersection,staged a sit-down protest. Most later dispersed voluntarily, butsome clashed with police a few blocks away.   Police fired tear gas at about 300 who were hurling rocks as theytried to march past the intersection. A few dozen people latergathered near the U.S. Embassy in central Seoul to continue theprotests.   Dozens of plainclothes police chased and arrested three of them.</TEXT></DOC>
