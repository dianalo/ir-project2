Mr. Greenspan wouldn't be specific. One obvious option isto reduce further the fraction of deposits that banks arerequired to hold as reserves with the Fed. But the Fed alsohas been working with other bank regulators on possiblechanges to the way they treat loans that appear to be goingsour.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;One way is to bring the fed funds {interest} rate downlower, but we're looking at other ways to restore a modicumof rational lending when dealing with credit-worthycustomers,&quot; Mr. Greenspan told the committee. &quot;We're lookingat possible other strategies.&quot;   In December, the Fed dropped the requirement that bankshold reserves against certificates of deposits withmaturities of less than 18 months held by businesses or otherinstitutions. But the Fed still requires banks to hold asreserves 3% of the first $41.1 million in deposits inchecking and similar accounts and 12% of the balance above$41.1 million. Banks don't earn interest on their reserves.   Mr. Greenspan said again that bankers' reluctance to lendis disrupting the normal mechanism by which the Fed pumpscredit into the banking system to increase the money supplyand spur economic activity. The Fed chairman said that banksare reluctant to lend because they are attempting tostrengthen their balance sheets. Reducing requirements wouldspeed that process by boosting bank profits.   In response to bankers' complaints, officials from theFed, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. have been considering accounting changes thatwould allow banks to report lower amounts of nonperformingloans, smaller loan-loss reserves and higher profits.   Currently, if a bank lends $1 million to a developer andbank examiners decide that the bank is likely to get backonly $800,000, the entire amount is classified as a bad loanand a certain fraction of the total must be set aside as aloan-loss reserve and deducted from the bank's profit. Theproposal under discussion would allow the bank to write off$200,000 and keep the remaining $800,000 on the books as agood loan, one regulator said. This would both reduce thelarge amounts of nonperforming loans on bank balance sheetsand send another signal to banks that regulators want them tokeep lending.   Earlier in the week, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that onereason for the credit crunch is that bankers fear thatregulators are more likely to classify loans as bad. &quot;I hopethat we can find ways in which to either disabuse them ofthat notion -- if it in fact is false -- or to alter it tothe extent that it is not,&quot; Mr. Greenspan said.   On another front to help ease the credit crunch, the FDICis in the midst of intense discussions with bankers over waysto head off bank failures and to bolster shaky banks withcapital infusions.   The discussions are part of an effort &quot;to aid the bankingsystem in its job of providing sufficient credit to theeconomy,&quot; FDIC Chairman William Seidman said.   Mr. Seidman called banking representatives to his officethis week and implored them to come up with an industry planto raise more money for the bank deposit insurance fund andcreate a new fund to keep poorly capitalized banks fromfailing. The bankers are looking at several ways to attractmore investment into banks that are judged to be basicallysound but temporarily undercapitalized. Such banks can'traise capital in the current economic climate and are beingforced to restrict their lending in the face of Fed effortsto encourage easier credit.   Bankers met at the FDIC for most of Tuesday and yesterdayand have begun to agree on the elements of a plan. Mr.Seidman said they are narrowing their differences andexpressed hope that they will reach an accord by the end ofthe week.   ---   Kenneth H. Bacon contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
