Sincewind power is a technically viable, low-cost energy supplier, there isa need to identify and assess the wind resource potential in PG andamp; E'sservice territory and also monitor the performance of existing wind farmsin Altamont Pass. As of September 1987, about 700 MW of wind potentialhas been developed in Altamont Pass. There are about 7300 wind turbineswhich generated 670 million kWhs in the first eight months of 1987. Thisis 155% of the production in the same period in 1986. This improvementin production is due to added capacity, better winds, and better turbineperformance. The PG andamp; E owned MOD-2 performed quite well in the firstseven months of 1987. In July it attained a capacity factor of .56, arecord for this turbine. Its total production to date, 14,500,000 kWhs,rivals that of the 3 MW Swedish WTS-3 unit for most kWh's ever producedby a single wind turbine. The total wind resource potential in PG andamp; E'sservice territory was estimated by them to be about 13,500 MW based primarilyon data from the California Wind Atlas recently issued by the Departmentof Water Resources for the California Energy Commission. The levelizedcost of energy (COE) was calculated using existing wind turbine, balanceof plant and transmission line cost estimates for the various wind resourceareas in PG andamp; E's service territory. The best sites were chosen for futuremonitoring and possible wind farm development.</TEXT></DOC>
