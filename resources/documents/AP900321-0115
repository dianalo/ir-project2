Gorbachev today orderedLithuanians to turn in their weapons, a day after the Balticrepublic's breakaway government demanded an end to Soviet militarymaneuvers.   The Soviet Interior Ministry should confiscate guns from anyonewho refuse to hand them in after a week, said Gorbachev's directiveread on the evening television program ``Vremya.''   Lithuania declared independence March 11, a move condemned byGorbachev and the Soviet Congress, and Lithuanians have begunsigning up for voluntary defense service.   The official news agency Tass said the decree aims ``to protectthe rights of Soviet citizens and Soviet soverignty in Lithuania.''   The decree ordered the KGB to ``step up security on the Sovietborder on Lithuanian territory and halt all illegitimate actionsviolating federal legislation on frontiers.''   The Soviet Foreign Ministry also was ordered to clamp tightercontrols on granting foreigners the right to travel to the republic.   In a telegram Tuesday night, Lithuanian Prime Minister KazimieraPrunskiene complained about unannounced Soviet military moves,which Lithuanians consider an attempt to intimidate them intobacking down on their declaration of independence.   ``The people of Lithuania are deeply disturbed about the actionsof the Soviet armed forces: the intense mobilization of armoredvehicles and tanks, the intensified flights of military air forceplanes, and unauthorized sorties into Lithuanian territory byparatroopers involved in intelligence activities,'' she said in thecable from Vilnius.   In Moscow, a bill establishing tough requirements for secessionpassed its first legislative hurdle. The Supreme Soviet's Councilof the Union, one of two chambers, gave the bill preliminaryapproval and sent it to the other chamber.   Deputies said the secession procedure, which requires arepublic-wide referendum and a transition period of up to fiveyears, would have to be observed by Lithuania, even though it hasalready declared its independence.   But Lithuanian deputy Vaidotas Antanaitis, who attended thesession as an observer, disagreed. ``The bill doesn't apply to us;we've already left,'' he said during a break in the proceedings.   The bill gained approval in a 175-15 vote after deputies arguedthat to delay its passage might lead more republics to copyLithuania's March 11 declaration of independence.   Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania's Parliament had not beennotified in advance of the maneuvers, which began over the weekend,nor on the status of the Soviet army in Lithuania. The Lithuanianswant Soviet troops to leave.   ``Representatives from U.S.S.R. ministries and agencies arrivein Lithuania and act without contacting the government ofLithuania,'' she complained in the telegram, which was addressed toPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other senior Soviet officials.   Mrs. Prunskiene called on the Kremlin to discuss the presence oftroops and other issues: ``The government is convinced that thereis a sound basis for coming to mutually beneficial understandingand for discussing issues of common interest in a calm and rationalmanner.''   The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies on Thursday declaredLithuania's March 11 declaration of independence illegal andinvalid but did not say what steps would be taken to try to preventsecession.   Gorbachev has said he would not use force and Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze, speaking Tuesday in Namibia, reiteratedthat position: ``We are against the use of force in any region, andparticularly against the use of force domestically.''   Lithuanian Deputy Prime Minister Kazimieras Motieka said Tuesdaythat Soviet military airfields in the republic ``have an excessivenumber of helicopters and perhaps also military units.''   Lithuania has eight Soviet military bases and tens of thousandsof troops, according to emigre sources.   The Lithuanians insist on negotiating independence and say theyintend to respect Soviet interests.   Lithuania's Parliament today began debate in the capital ofVilnius on defining the structure of its new government,specifically on trimming the number of its ministries.   There was no sign today of Soviet troop movements. Officialsalso said there were no signs of an economic blockade that manyLithuanians have anticipated in retaliation for the declaration ofindependence.   ``We are still receiving gas and oil,'' Lithuania's two mostcritical imports from the Soviet Union, said Mrs. Prunskiene, aneconomist who was elected prime minister on Saturday.   In a stern warning to Lithuania on Monday, the Kremlin orderedits ministries to ensure that no Moscow-run enterprises or agencieswere turned over to Lithuania.   It also said it would not tolerate a Lithuanian attempt to takeover control of its boders, but the Lithuanians moved ahead withplans to take charge of the frontiers and youths volunteered tohelp.   Signs in Vilnius said the Sajudis grass-roots nationalistmovement was handling the registration of men between ages of 19and 40 who were ready to serve in defense of the region.   Both men and women were responding to the call and crowded thetiny office in the Parliament building to fill out the forms.   Lithuanian officials said they intend to set up border andcustoms forces to show the world's governments that Lithuaniacontrols its territory and should be formally recognized asindependent.   So far, no foreign country has officially recognized Lithuaniaas independent.   Mrs. Prunskiene said the government hoped to have installedwithing 10 days 37 border posts in locations on the Soviet andPolish frontiers that are not occupied by Soviet forces.</TEXT></DOC>
