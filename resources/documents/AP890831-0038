After Wednesday's verdict, juror Michael Clark said the jurydecided to acquit Mrs. Helmsley of the most serious charge,conspiracy to commit extortion, because they were unclear on whatconstituted extortion.   ``A lot of the people thought that you had to get your legsbroken to get extorted and this sounded mild,'' Clark said. ``Therewere a number of jurors who felt very uncomfortable with thedefinition.''   The charge, which carried a 20-year sentence, alleged that the69-year-old Mrs. Helmsley and her aide, Frank Turco, conspired toextort payoffs and goods from vendors doing business with theHelmsley organization _ which has far-flung real estate holdings,including some of New York's most luxurious hotels.   After a two-month trial and five days of deliberation, the jurorsconvicted Mrs. Helmsley of 33 of 41 counts, including conspiracy todefraud the Internal Revenue Service, tax evasion and other taxfraud charges.   Her co-defendants, former aides Turco and Joseph Licari, wereconvicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme. Turco also wasacquitted of extortion conspiracy. All three were acquitted on mailfraud charges.   Each of the 33 counts against Mrs. Helmsley carry a maximumprison term of three or five years. She also could be fined nearly$8 million. Sentencing before U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr.was scheduled for Nov. 14.   Interviews of 15 prominent lawyers by Manhattan Lawyer magazineabout Walker's sentencing reputation indicated that Mrs. Helmsleywas unlikely to avoid prison.   Mrs. Helmsley, described as a persnickety ``queen'' in Helmsleyhotel ads, was depicted at the trial as arrogant, penny-pinching andmean-spirited. Even her own lawyer described her as ``a toughbitch.''   After listening to the litany of guilty verdicts, Mrs. Helmsley _a one-time Chesterfield cigarette girl and successful model _ sat inthe courtroom and conferred with lawyers and family for an hour.   She then left the courthouse by the front steps, where she wassurrounded by hundreds of photographers, camera crews, reporters andbystanders. She got into a limousine and departed without comment,even as she was taunted by some.   ``How do you feel, Leona?'' one shouted. ``Inquiring peasantswant to know.''   On ABC-TV's ``Nightline,'' Clark called the hoopla surroundingthe trial ``sickening'' after he read newspapers a friend saved forhim.   ``The whole thing has been a sickening experience _ the press,the television, the people on the street,'' he said.   Mrs. Helmsley's lawyer, Gerald Feffer, said the conviction wouldbe appealed.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the convictions were a deterrentto anyone considering cheating on their taxes.   ``It's an opportunity to remind the public, and we need remindingevery now and then, that the law applies equally to everyone,'' hesaid.   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, still face prosecution on astate indictment alleging evasion of state taxes. No trial date hasbeen set.   Helmsley, 80, was charged in the April 1988 federal indictmentbut was not tried because the judge found him mentally incompetent.   In finding Mrs. Helmsley guilty, the jury decided she had evaded$1.2 million in taxes, most of it by billing $3.1 million inexpenses for the Helmsleys' Greenwich, Conn., mansion to theHelmsley business.   Prosecutors also charged that $320,172 in Mrs. Helmsley'spersonal purchases _ including thousands of dollars in designerclothing and $8 for underwear _ were charged to the Park Lane Hotel,one of several Helmsley hotels in Manhattan.   Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses added to the harsh personalportrait. They described how she fired employees at the slightestprovocation, disputed bills and always sought the lowest price.   Her former housekeeper testified that Mrs. Helmsley once toldher: ``We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.''   Feffer sought to discredit the witnesses as disgruntledex-employees. He argued that the Helmsleys did nothing wrong inbilling their companies for part of their mansion expenses becausethey used the estate for business.</TEXT></DOC>
