Brokerage houses can tell you their 10 favorite stocks.    Timetables vary, but brokerage firms are especially fond of issuing stock lists in the summer. That's partly due to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which has made its list of &quot;Uncommon Values in Common Stocks&quot; a summer tradition for 39 years. The list's long-term track record is impressive: To date, its picks have appreciated 24,981%, compared with 2,044% for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index, according to Shearson Lehman.    But a look at five lists issued last summer shows that investors shouldn't expect any special magic. In most cases, investors could have done almost as well by throwing darts at the New York Stock Exchange listings. They would have done considerably better just buying the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    A backward glance at last summer's lists also shows that the best recommendations don't necessarily come from the biggest and best-known brokerage houses. Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc., a relatively small firm based in Minneapolis, outdid Shearson and two other big New York firms, as well as Hartford, Conn.-based Advest Inc.    The midyear lists analyzed included 10 stocks each from Shearson, the Merrill Lynch Market Letter and Prudential-Bache Securities. Piper Jaffray's list consisted of 14 stocks; Advest's had eight.    The accompanying table shows the results investors would have achieved by purchasing equal dollar amounts of each list's recommended stocks on Aug. 1, 1986, and holding the shares until July 31, 1987, regardless of any subsequent recommendations. Dividends were included in the analysis; commissions and taxes weren't.    Piper, Prudential-Bache and the Merrill Lynch Market Letter all beat the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, but not by much. Shearson's highly touted list didn't match the index, and Advest's fell well short of it.    The Minneapolis firm picked four solid winners -- Champion International Corp., General Electric Co., Geo. A. Hormel andamp; Co., and NCR -- each up between 60% and 70%. Alone among the five firms, it showed a gain on every stock recommended.    John A. Tauer, a managing director in Piper's research department, says the firm looks for undervalued stocks selling for reasonable multiples of earnings per share. Last summer, he says, the firm was emphasizing interest-sensitive stocks. Now, it is emphasizing cyclical and technology stocks.    Both Piper and runner-up Prudential-Bache stressed consumer stocks, reasoning that tax revision, lower gas prices and lower interest rates would enable consumers to spend briskly in 1986-87. Prudential-Bache had the two biggest winners on any of the five lists -- Gillette Co. (up 94%) and clothing retailer Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. (up 87%).    Prudential-Bache analysts liked Gillette for its commanding market share in the razor and blade market. But in the end, it was takeover interest from Revlon Group that got the stock into a lather.    Despite its pair of big hits, Prudential-Bache's total return was pulled down by one major loser -- Mellon Bank Corp. Bad loans and plunging profits sent Mellon shares reeling downward 30%, contradicting Prudential-Bache's expectation of an &quot;exciting turnaround story.&quot;    Anne E. Gregory, publisher of the Merrill Lynch Market Letter, stresses that its stock picks don't constitute official recommendations of parent company Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith Inc. She says the letter is sold to some 70,000 subscribers, many of whom aren't Merrill Lynch customers.    The letter, Ms. Gregory adds, recommends stocks twice a month, not just once or twice a year. It highlights &quot;midyear investment ideas&quot; in a special format only for &quot;competitive reasons,&quot; she says.    Ms. Gregory maintains a fairer way to evaluate is to use the past 24 issues, not just one, or to focus on Merrill Lynch's more closely watched year-end list of stocks, which she says was up 56.5% since December.    At Shearson, company officials concede that the company's list underperformed the market in 1986-87 and in three of the past four years. Jack Rivkin, Shearson's recently appointed research director, says that even in a year like the past one, the list met its goal, which is &quot;to make money for people.&quot; He adds that &quot;to the extent there were mistakes, I think the mistakes were in focusing on some smaller companies.&quot; Foreign investors, who have had a big impact on the market, have been concentrating on big-capitalization and well-known companies, he notes.    His aim on this year's list, Mr. Rivkin says, was to shift the focus back to &quot;uncommon values,&quot; as opposed to &quot;uncommon companies.&quot; Thus, the 1987-88 list includes such household names as McDonald's Corp. and Northwest Airlines.    The performance of the 1986-87 Shearson list was hurt by three stocks that declined -- H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., Boeing Co., and Nicor Inc.    Advest, which trailed the rest of the group, was hurt by a 32% loss in S.E. Nichols Inc., a regional retailer, and a 26% loss in Shared Medical Systems Corp., a provider of computer systems to hospitals.    Howard Nichol, a vice president and analyst, says that the firm had changed its recommendation on Shared Medical Systems in February when the company indicated its growth targets wouldn't be met. A customer who heeded the change would have gotten out before the price collapsed, and, in fact, would have made money on the stock, he says.    Advest also changed its opinion on S.E. Nichols in October. But that was too late to avert most of the damage, as the price had already slid to less than $7.50 from more than $10 a share in early August.    ---                      Stock-Pick Scorecard    How midyear picks by five brokerage firms panned out: Piper Jaffray                     37% Prudential-Bache                  36% Merrill Lynch                     34% Shearson Lehman Bros.             29% Advest                            19% Dow Jones Industrial Average      46% NYSE Composite Index              32%    Note: Midyear stock picks' estimated total return,including dividends, for the year ended July 31, 1987.
