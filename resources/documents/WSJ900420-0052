On Dec. 31, Great American reported underperforming assetsof $645.6 million, compared with $453.4 million on Sept. 30,according to a regulatory filing with the Office of ThriftSupervision. The company's total &quot;classified&quot; assets, abroader measure of actual or potential loan problems, rose59% to $1.30 billion from $814.6 million at Sept. 30, thefiling said.</LP><TEXT>   The increases help explain the $198.9 million, or $8.30 ashare, net loss that the company reported on Tuesday for thefourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with year-earlierprofit of $19.8 million, or 80 cents. The capital-consumingeffect of the deficit, and other problems, has left SanDiego-based Great American, the nation's eighth-largestthrift with $15.9 billion in assets, on the verge of havingto sell or dismantle itself or face possible federal seizure.   On Tuesday, Great American said it was making provisionfor loan and foreclosed real-estate losses of $271.2 million,but declined to specify the size of its troubled-loanportfolio. According to the OTS filing, the company had lossreserves on Dec. 31 equal to about 19% of its underperformingassets, excluding previous write-downs, and had set asidereserves or taken write-downs equal to about 35% of its totaltroubled assets.   Analysts said the growth in troubled assets, largelyreflecting a disastrous 1986 acquisition of an Arizonathrift, will complicate Great American's efforts to saveitself. At year-end, according to the filing, roughly 23% ofthe thrift's total $2.6 billion of assets in Arizona wereconsidered real or potential trouble. The company must raise$350 million in new capital by year-end as part of aregulator-approved plan unveiled earlier this week to complywith minimum federal capital standards.   A Great American spokesman said the company considers itsloss reserves to be adequate. He added: &quot;We are stilldiscussing the bank with a number of qualified investors, andare proceeding with our operations according to our capitalplan.&quot;   The three biggest California banks -- BankAmerica Corp.,Security Pacific Corp., and Wells Fargo andamp; Co. -- areinterested in expanding in the lucrative San Diego market andare considered potential bidders for Great American.
