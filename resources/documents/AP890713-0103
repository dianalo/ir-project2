Journal, on President Bush's plan for federalpay raises:   President Bush faces a difficult task in selling Congress and theAmerican people on his broad and generous pay raise plan for federalemployees.   It's not that some relief isn't probably justified overall,critical for retention of key specialists in a few areas. It's justthat the federal government is low on money _ most taxpayers are too_ and the economy is slowing down to boot.   Public sentiment on public salaries was demonstrated unmistakablyin the congressional pay raise bloodbath earlier this year. Bush isproposing hikes of from 8 to 25 percent for some 7,900 topgovernment employees, plus $100,000-plus salaries for a few hundredspecialists with critical skills. Administration spokesmen said theyhad had many qualified government service candidates who couldn'tafford the pay cut to accept government service.   Congress _ and the voters _ should educate themselves on thissituation before rejecting Bush's proposal out of hand.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 11   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on Bush's pay plan:   President Bush's proposal last week to give 7,900 federalexecutives pay raises of 8 to 25 percent is both prudent and timely.Congressional action authorizing the increase is merited.   Equally worthy of approval is the president's additional proposalto ban congressional honoraria, though he would delay it for 18months. Honoraria should go immediately.   The raise for senior government officials should have beenproposed first and separately from the proposed 51 percentcongressional pay raise that sank after an angry public outcry earlythis year.   The pay of these officials has eroded significantly in comparisonto comparable jobs in the private sector, and as a result, theadministration says, about 40 potential executives turned downgovernment appointments.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 10   Seattle Post-Intelligencer, on arms reduction:   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev continues to make dramaticproposals and declarations that are ratcheting down the historictensions between the Soviet Union and the United States and its WestEuropean allies.   In France last week, at a meeting of the Council of Europe,Gorbachev once again commanded world headlines by, in effect,nullifying what has come to be known as the Brezhnev doctrine. Thatwas a seemingly bedrock philosophy that the Soviet Union wasjustified in using force to keep communist-bloc nations of EasternEurope within the fold. ...   Gorbachev's talk in France also sought to spur negotiations onreductions of tactical nuclear weapons, which have represented thecornerstone of U.S. and NATO deterrence to Warsaw Pact forces inEurope.   Bush is right to insist on a U.S.-Soviet agreement onconventional force reductions prior to talks on tactical weapons,which also is the adopted policy of NATO.   As welcome as Gorbachev's tension-reducing overtures are, theWest must not be stampeded into risky arms agreements it might cometo regret.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 7   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on racial quotas:   Some minorities, especially Asian-Americans, are discovering thatethnic and racial quotas can cut both ways _ and that neither way isvery good for American society.   The latest quota controversy stems from reports that many of thenation's finest colleges and universities are explicitly limitingadmissions of Asian-Americans. At the University of California atBerkeley, for example, officials admitted that their policies ineffect imposed a quota on the number of Asian-Americans accepted totheir school.   Congress is in an uproar over the reports, and 23 members of theHouse have co-sponsored a bill that would put Congress on recordagainst college admission ceilings based on racial or ethnicorigins. The bill shouldn't be necessary: The Civil Rights Act of1964 prohibits discrimination based on race or ethnicity in anyinstitution that receives federal funding. ...   All quotas erode the ability of employers (or college recruiters)to hire or accept the best, most qualified people.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
