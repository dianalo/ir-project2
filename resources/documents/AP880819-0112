Also today, the Beirut weekly Ash-Shiraa said the release of theBritish hostages was imminent but said the release of otherhostages would take more time. The report, quoting an unidentifiedwest Beirut leader, said two separate negotiations to free thehostages are under way.   The report in Ash-Shiraa, which broke the story of U.S. secretarms sale to Iran in November 1986, could not be independentlyverified. Many of its previous stories about the hostages have notbeen accurate.   It said the kidnappers sought money and ``and at the same timeeconomic, military and political conditions set by Iran.'' It didnot elaborate.   Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, said, ``I think it is grosslyunjust for you to hold Terry Anderson for ransom that includes whatamounts to a complete peace settlement in the entire region and theend of centuries' old hostilities.'' The text of Mrs. Say's messagewas published by Beirut's two leading newspapers, An-Nahar andAs-Safir.   ``In the past three and a half years, I have tried my very bestto pressure my government to negotiate for Terry's release and therelease of the other hostages,'' Mrs. Say wrote.   ``You have now presented new demands which are impossible for meto put forth to my government,'' wrote Mrs. Say, who lives inKentucky.   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press and has been held longer than any of the 18foreign hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which holdsAnderson and American hostage Thomas Sutherland, released astatement Thursday that set four demands for the release of thecaptives.   Two of the demands were new: the unconditional withdrawal of allthe Israeli forces and their Christian militia allies from southLebanon, and U.S. compensation and aid for the reconstruction ofwar-ravaged south Lebanon and Beirut.   The group also demanded the release of all Lebanese andPalestinian ``mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors, from prisons inChristian east Beirut as well as in Israel and Israel'sself-designated security zone in Lebanon. Israel and alliedmilitiamen of the South Lebanon Army control a 10-mile-deep enclavein south Lebanon to guard against cross-border guerrilla forays.   Unlike many of its previous communications, the Shiite Moslemfaction did not specifically ask for the release of 17 suspectsheld in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983.But the sweeping statement about prisoners seemed to incorporatethis demand.   Islamic Jihad has admitted holding Anderson and Sutherland, 56,acting dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut.Sutherland, of Fort Collins, Colo., was abducted June 9, 1985.   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held bypro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican church envoy TerryWaite, journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfastman with dual British and Irish nationality whose release is alsosought by the Irish government.   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, aNew York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claimthey killed him. His body was never found.</TEXT></DOC>
