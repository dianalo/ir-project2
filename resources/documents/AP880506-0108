The study of two hospitals, reported in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, found that technicians and clerksoften changed doctors' orders for thyroid function tests.   While they found that ``disturbing,'' the researchers weresurprised to find that, in many cases, especially when computerswere involved, the changes actually improved the tests.   ``The net effect of the changes to orders by non-physicians wasto reduce the number of inappropriately tested patients from 37percent to 25 percent,'' the researchers said.   The study was conducted at an unidentified university medicalcenter and a Veterans' Administration hospital.   ``Laboratory testing is becoming increasingly complex, and it'simportant to assure quality care throughout the whole system, fromthe transmission of the order to the performance of the test,''said Dr. Albert F. Finn, who wrote the report with two otherpathologists at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.   Changing doctors' orders could ``delay diagnosis as well asincrease unnecessary testing,'' the researchers said, and such apractice is unacceptable under state laws and hospital bylaws.   In 54 percent of the 181 cases studied at the two hospitals,clerical or lab staff changed one or more test orders, theresearchers found.   The university hospital's clerical staff, who filed doctors'requests using computer-based test agendas that list appropriatetests for specific diagnostic problems, ``significantly improved''the appropriateness of doctors' test orders, the study found.   But changes made at the VA hospital, where clerks usedhandwritten requisition slips, tended to make the orders lessappropriate, the researchers said.   Finn said in a telephone interview Thursday that more study isneeded to determine how much staff members participate in testing.   He and his colleagues recommended that non-medical staff reviewlaboratory test orders and bring improper requests to the attentionof the physician, as pharmacists do.   But Dr. Edward T. Wong and Dr. Janice Nelson took issue with thesuggestion in an accompanying editorial, saying it ``would shiftthe burden for the error from the physician to the ward clerk ortechnologist'' charged with the review.   They recommended a method used at the University of SouthernCalifornia Medical Center at Los Angeles, where Wong is vicechairman of the pathology department.   Doctors there use test request forms in which groups ofappropriate tests are linked to specific diagnostic problems so thephysician can avoid ``having to decipher and select from a list oftest names encrypted in jargon,'' they said.   Wong said that with laboratory tests accounting for about 10percent to 15 percent of total medical costs, it is important toensure that tests meet doctors' diagnostic needs.</TEXT></DOC>
