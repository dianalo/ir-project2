Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Israel seized anArab-owned house after the High Court of Justice ruled the armycould evict residents and set up a command post. The house sits onthe strategic Jerusalem-Hebron road.   ``The military government said ... they must do something tostop the throwing of stones,'' Ahmed Abuy Riad, who lived in thehouse, told Israeli television. ``But the stones weren't thrown byme .... I am innocent.''   A military representative, speaking on condition of anonymity,said violent protests broke out in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwanneighborhood on Thursday. Two military border policemen were hit byrocks, and two Gazans were shot in the legs and slightly wounded,the official said.   Also Thursday, a Gaza man, 37-year-old Hadel Hafez el Toruk,died after he was shot four times last Friday in Gaza City.   The shooting occurred at the same time that soldiers fired at agroup of Arabs after one threw a firebomb in central Gaza City, thearmy said.   The military spokesman said the army was checking to see ifToruk was shot by the troops.   If so, he would be the 235th Palestinian killed in theeight-month revolt against Israeli rule in the West Bank and GazaStrip, the territories captured from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967Middle East War. Four Israelis have also been killed.   In politics, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Thursdaythat he welcomed meetings between U.S. Assistant Secretary of StateRichard Murphy and Palestinians, as long as they do not belong tothe Palestine Liberation Organization.   Murphy has said he wants to meet again with Palestinians in theMiddle East, something he had done in the past.   The U.S. official is scheduled to travel to the Middle East fromGeneva during the first week in August for a peace mission thatwill take him to Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Egypt.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman saidThursday she was unaware of any concrete plans for Murphy to talkto Palestinian leaders. She also said U.S. policy of refusing tomeet PLO leaders remained in place.   Peres said he did not care if the Palestinians that might meetwith Murphy supported the PLO ideologically, as long as they werenot members. Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, calling it aterrorist group.   ``We do not censor ideas....'' Peres said. ``They should comewithout rocks, without knives, without fire bombs.''</TEXT></DOC>
