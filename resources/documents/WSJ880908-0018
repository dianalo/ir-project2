The SEC's action &quot;ensures&quot; that Congress will send President Reagan a new insider-trading bill before it adjourns, said Rep. Edward Markey, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.    The Massachusetts Democrat said that the SEC, in bringing charges against Drexel, &quot;alleged the most massive and pervasive scheme of fraud on Wall Street since the 1920s.&quot; In addition, he pointed out, the SEC alleged that convicted insider traders Dennis Levine and Ivan Boesky were &quot;merely puppets&quot; under Drexel's control.    &quot;Clearly, the laissez-faire policies of the 1980s have created the atmosphere to feed this predators' frenzy,&quot; he asserted.    In the Senate, Michigan Democrat Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking subcommittee on securities, said that the Drexel case highlights the urgency of enacting tougher insider-trading legislation. &quot;Insider-trading abuses and stock-manipulation abuses have to be brought to an end,&quot; he said in a statement.    However, the prospects for the insider-trading legislation this year remain very uncertain. The proposed legislation is sure to stir considerable debate, and lawmakers have very little time to act because they are eager to adjourn in order to campaign for the November elections.    Sen. Riegle expressed hope that by bringing the case against Drexel the government will help restore investor confidence in the stock market. &quot;The small investor has been wondering if he or she has been getting a fair shake, and in many cases, they have not,&quot; he said.    The Michigan lawmaker already has held hearings on legislation that would increase the maximum insider-trading penalties to 10 years in prison from five years, and to a $1 million fine from $100,000. The bill also would require an automatic prison sentence for obstructing justice in stock-manipulation cases.    &quot;With this (Drexel case) as the impetus, I'm going to see if we can vote the bill out of committee ands get it to the Senate floor,&quot; Sen. Riegle said.    Similar insider-trading legislation is pending in the House. The bill, among other things, would stiffen penalties and would hold securities firms liable for insider-trading violations by their employees.    In the meantime, federal regulators will be monitoring markets closely in the wake of the SEC action. They don't expect the lodging of the charges against Drexel and others to cause any unusual turmoil, though.    Mark Fitterman, an associate director of market regulation for the SEC, wouldn't comment yesterday on any possible contingency planning for disarray in the markets. Previously, however, SEC officials have said they don't think the Drexel matter would necessitate special action beyond market surveillance.    At the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, a spokesman asked, &quot;Why would there be disorderly markets? Everybody has been expecting this. I don't see why we would have to do anything.&quot;    The Fed does move to calm financial markets at times of extreme uncertainty, as it did when the stock market crashed last October. Normally, it intervenes directly only in currency markets and the U.S. government securities market.    Federal regulators likely will pay special attention to the so-called junk-bond market, in which Drexel Burnham has long played a major role. In the past, SEC officials have expressed confidence that, with the help of stock exchanges, they would be able to monitor the junk-bond market adequately once civil charges were filed against Drexel.    There has been speculation that if the junk-bond market collapses -- a development regarded as very unlikely -- some securities firms might find themselves short on capital. SEC officials have said that the agency and the New York Stock Exchange will closely monitor the ability of firms to meet capital-adequacy standards.    The SEC's decision to file the charges in the middle of the week surprised some observers. It had been long assumed that the agency wouldn't act until late on a Friday afternoon in order to give market participants a weekend to absorb the news. The midweek filing was seen as an indication that the SEC doesn't expect the markets to react wildly today.    ---   Thomas E.
