<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-26-1088 </DOCNO><TEXT>Ion mixing of thin markers in Zr was investigated by irradiating with660 keV Kr/sup ++/ ions at temperatures between 300 to 423 K. Very thinfilms of vacuum evaporated Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Hf, W, and Au servedas markers. The samples were analyzed by 2 MeV He backscattering spectrometry.The marker elements that are likely to dissolve interstitially in Zrhave higher mixing efficiencies at elevated irradiation temperature thatthe markers that are likely to dissolve substitutionally. The resultsare explained by radiation-enhanced diffusion theory.</TEXT></DOC>
