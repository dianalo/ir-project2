China said today that some Chinese were wounded in the exchangeof gunfire in the South China Sea.   The Voice of Vietnam radio said the freighters have been on firesince they were attacked Monday near disputed islands claimed byVietnam, China, the Philippines and Taiwan.   Vietnam calls the islands the Truong Sa archipelago. They areknown in China as the Nansha Islands. They also are called theSpratly Islands.   The broadcast said Nguyen Phuong Vu, head of the Chinadepartment of Vietnam's Foreign Ministry, made the accusations in ameeting today with Li Shuchin, Beijing's ambassador to Hanoi.   ``The Vietnamese side sent lifeboats flying Red Cross flags torescue those freighters, but they were obstructed by Chinesewarships,'' said the broadcast, monitored in Bangkok.   It added: ``The Vietnamese side urged the Chinese side to orderits warships to move away from this area and not to prevent theVietnamese ships from coming to the rescue of the crews on thesefreighters. The Vietnamese side wishes a favorable and early replyfrom the Chinese side.''   The broadcast repeated earlier claims that the clash began whenthe Chinese warships without provocation opened fire on twoVietnamese freighters. It said that warships Nos. 502, 506 and 531then fired on other Vietnamese freighters that had come to therescue.   Vietnam's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday delivered an officialprotest to China's ambassador to Hanoi, Li Shuchin, the officialRadio Hanoi reported earlier.   The note called the alleged Chinese attack a militaryprovocation and attempt to grab Vietnamese territory. It saidVietnam will ``resolutely apply all necessary measures to protect(its) independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.''   In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry disclosed today that China hadsuffered casualties in the skirmish.   Ministry spokeswoman Li Jihua gave China's version of the clash,saying Vietnamese naval ships fired on Chinese vessels conducting ascientific survey on a reef in the chain of 500 uninhabited islandsand reefs.   ``The Chinese side was forced to make a limited counter-attackin self defense,'' Ms. Li said.   Ms. Li refused to disclose how many Chinese were wounded,whether they were civilians or military personnel, or other detailsof the clash.   Large oil deposits are believed to be in the vicinity of thearchipelago, which is more than 310 miles south of Hainan Island.   Vietnam has stationed troops on a few of the islands since theearly 1970s, while China has troops on a few islands of a seconddisputed group, the nearby Xisha or Paracels.   The clash Monday was the first reported exchange of gunfirebetween Vietnam and China over the islands, although the twogovernments periodically have verbal skirmishes.   China was an ally of Vietnam's Communist Party during theVietnam War but relations cooled after the Communist Vietnamesevictory as Vietnam drifted closer into the Soviet orbit.   China and Vietnam fought a brief border war in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
