<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0613 </DOCNO><TEXT>Iron Moessbauer spectroscopy has been performed on 38 residues of hydroliquefactionof the French bituminous Freyming coal, without and with added iron basedcatalysts. 56 to 94% of the area of each spectrum was occupied by 2,3, 4 or 5 sextets of Fe{sub 1}/sub -//sub x/S, either at 295 K or at78 K or at 4 K. Values of H at 295 K are proposed. The vacancies responsiblefor the values of H are likely to be randomly ditributed. The best accuracyon the relative intensities cannot ensure a precise determination ofthe overall stoichiometry, so that a better knowledge of the samplesis given by the distribution of the Fe sites. 15 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
