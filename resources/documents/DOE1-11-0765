<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-11-0765 </DOCNO><TEXT>Solid state thin film CdSe solar cells based on differently depositedCdSe films have been investigated by dark capacitance measurements, I-Vanalysis, electron microscopy and roentgendiffractometry. The elucidatedenergy diagram shows encouraging barrier heights of 0.9-1 V and build-involtages of 0.65-0.8 V. Deposition conditions causing crystallographicdisorder and low open circuit voltages and efficiencies are identified.At first the deposition parameters will be optimized. Later on the dopingof both CdSe and ZnSe has to be investigated. 1 fig., 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
