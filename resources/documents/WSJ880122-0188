A spokesman for the maker of medical devices and lasers said the proposed transaction remains subject to approval by regulators and shareholders. He added that it would be &quot;reasonable to anticipate&quot; a gain from the sale, but called it &quot;premature&quot; to elaborate. Cooper said it expects to close the sale of the Stamford, Conn.-based operation by April 30.    The ultrasonics business, which makes high-technology medical equipment, employs about 140 people and had sales of about $21 million in the year ended Oct. 31. Cooper's total sales for the latest year were $64.6 million.    Sale of the ultrasonics operation leaves Cooper LaserSonics a maker of medical lasers. </TEXT></DOC>
