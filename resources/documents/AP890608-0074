At the same time, the government issued new martial law ordersdemanding that student leaders surrender.   Li gave a rousing speech to hundreds of soldiers inside the GreatHall of the People on the square where thousands demonstrated andwhere the massacre of hundreds of students took place over theweekend. It was his first appearance in public since May 25.   Li's speech was shown on television after hundreds of militarytrucks roared into the city center with new supplies. Busloads offoreigners, fearing new violence, rushed to the airport to catchemergency flights out.   Li, accompanied by Vice President Wang Zhen, also regarded as ahard-line conservative, was dressed in a Mao suit and looked fit.   The martial law orders appeared to suggest the government wasplanning large-scale arrests of activists who led the movement for afreer and less corrupt China.   The capital's streets were relatively calm today.   Li is believed to be among the leaders who pushed for themilitary crackdown that ended in the weekend massacre of hundreds ofunarmed civilians as troops cleared Tiananmen Square ofpro-democracy protesters.   He had not appeared in public since five days after his May 20declaration of martial law in the capital, and his appearanceindicated hardliners may have prevailed over leaders who opposedusing troops to quell the protests.   The student protesters had demanded Li resign for declaringmartial law after weeks of pro-democracy protests, primarily inBeijing.   The martial law orders called the leaders of independent studentand union groups ``important members of the counterrevolutionaryturmoil.'' It demanded that all members of the groups, leaders ofthe pro-democracy movement smashed by the military, turn themselvesin to police.   Radio and television gave telephone numbers for people to call toreport those who stood up against the military takeover of the city.   In a continuing propaganda campaign supporting the harsh militaryactions, national television repeatedly showed footage of crowdsattacking soldiers and burning vehicles during the crackdown inBeijing on Saturday night and Sunday.   It showed gruesome shots of three soldiers who were burned todeath. One was disembowelled.   In his speech to the soldiers, Li urged them ``to continueworking hard to protect the capital's safety and order.'' Theycheered and applauded.   A Hong Kong newspaper had reported that he had been shot andwounded in the thigh by a police officer on Sunday after themilitary took Tiananmen Square.   Hundreds of troop trucks rumbled into the city of Beijing earlytoday, but residents claimed the hated 27th Army, which carried outthe weekend assault, had left the city, replaced by new troops.   Citizens attempted to establish order in their shattered livesunder the watchful eyes of martial law troops, and the governmentissued a new decree making it illegal to put up barricades in thestreet and disrupt traffic.   Last week, the people had pushed buses, trucks and other objectsinto the streets in futile efforts to stop troops from entering thecity.   The main concern has been that military units opposing theviolent suppression of the pro-democracy movement would launch anattack to drive the 27th Army from Beijing. Roughly 200,000 troopsfrom about 13 army groups are bunched in and around the city.   In buses and caravans, many bearing their countrys' flags,foreigners left for the airport, where chartered flights took themout of the country. They included non-essential personnel at theU.S. Embassy and their families.   ``We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, andthe biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pullingthem out of town,'' U.S. Ambassador James Lilley told reporters atthe airport.   One Asian diplomat said Chinese officials in the past few dayshad been privately urging foreigners to leave the city because ofthe impending danger.   However, troops were seen with brooms today rather than automaticrifles, sweeping the streets south of Tiananmen.   Elsewhere, disturbances still wracked many provincial cities.   A Chinese source in Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, whereanti-government violence has been reported, said troops had comeinto the city but left.   In Shanghai, much of the work force stayed away from jobs becauseof street barricades set up in anticipation of a military assault.   Other cities where protesters had barricaded rail lines and roadsand besieged government offices included Nanjing, Harbin, Tianjinand Lanzhou.   There was a semblance of normalcy in Beijing for the first timesince the weekend onslaught. Bicyclists were able to pass unimpededon the south side of Tiananmen and catch a glimpse of the hugemilitary encampment there.   Armed soldiers lined the streets, but there were no confirmedreports of troops opening fire on crowds, which was common untiltoday.   In one incident, soldiers smashed the camera equipment of aBritish Broadcasting Corp. crew and held a gun to the head of onecrewman. The crew, filming near a burned out vehicle near thetroops, was released after 30 minutes of questioning at gunpoint.   China's hard-line leaders, who appeared to gain the upper hand ina behind-the-scenes power struggle last week, issued two harshedicts Wednesday.   One said troops were authorized to ``forcefully dispose of, onthe spot'' anyone who resists arrest. The other said any CommunistParty members who ``plotted, organized and led the rebellion''during the student protests would be expelled from the party andpunished severely. It did not mention any names.   A few vehicles ventured onto main streets Wednesday, but gasstations remained closed, public transportation was stopped, mailand newspapers weren't delivered and many stores were closed.   The official Xinhua News Agency said many people are hoardingfood. Long lines formed outside those groceries that were open.   People on Beijing's streets said the 27th Army had been replacedin the city center by ``more peaceful'' troops from the 63rd, 68thand 20th armies. Soldiers said to be from the 20th Army groupengaged in relaxed conversation with groups of residents justsoutheast of Tiananmen.</TEXT></DOC>
