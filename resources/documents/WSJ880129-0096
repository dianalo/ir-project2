Nelson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> TNM FIN INS </IN><DATELINE> BRUSSELS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   An investor group has commitments to buy enough of a new issue of shares in Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. to control the giant holding company, sources involved in the struggle said.    If a Brussels court rules the share offering legal, the group, led by Andre Leysen, could prevent the Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti from gaining effective control of the company. At the same time, the group could snatch control from the holding company's current management.    Mr. Leysen, chairman of another Belgian holding company, Gevaert N.V., and his group, which comprises Belgian and other European companies, are trying to buy the entire block of 12 million new shares that Generale de Belgique issued to protect itself from Mr. De Benedetti, Brussels financial sources said. The stake would give Mr. Leysen's group 30% of the enlarged capital of the company.    Generale de Belgique couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday.    When the Gevaert group first surfaced as the third force in the battle earlier this week, it said it would buy between eight million and 10 million of the newly issued shares. It was unclear then whether the group would side with Mr. De Benedetti, the current management or take an independent course. It has become increasingly clear that the group, while depending on an accord with current management, is seeking to play an independent role in managing Generale de Belgique.    Mr. Leysen wouldn't comment on how many shares he was trying to buy, but he said he will make a statement today &quot;concerning the full implications of the affair and what we plan to do.&quot;    The Gevaert group's plan puts the decision squarely in the hands of the Brussels Commercial Court, which already has made two temporary rulings saying the newly issued shares are illegal. But both earlier rulings were made without input from Generale de Belgique. The court is expected to make a final ruling, hearing both sides of the case, on Wednesday.    Mr. De Benedetti's group is confident the court will rule in its favor, said Jan Vannieuwenburg, spokesman for Cerus S.A., the French investment firm through which Mr. De Benedetti is trying to buy almost 25% of Generale de Belgique. &quot;Our point of view is very simple,&quot; he said. &quot;For the moment, the law says these shares are illegal.&quot;    The Belgian Banking Commission is expected Tuesday to make a final decision about whether Mr. De Benedetti can launch a partial bid for Generale de Belgique. Mr. De Benedetti has offered 3,400 Belgian francs ($97) for an additional 15% of the company's shares, beyond the 18.6% he already controls. Mr. De Benedetti has agreed with the Belgian Finance Ministry to limit his holding to below 25% and to sell any additional shares he receives in his offer to Belgian partners.    If the Brussels Commercial Court, which has the final say, rules the special defensive shares valid, the Gevaert group will hold 30% of the share capital of Generale de Belgique and would thus have effective control of the company. Under Belgian law, any shareholder with 25% or more of a company has a &quot;blocking minority&quot; and is able to block decisions of the directors. The new shares, if validated, would dilute Mr. De Benedetti's current holding to about 13%.    Under its accord with Generale de Belgique, the Gevaert group would be able to make changes in the way the company is managed. Generale de Belgique President Rene Lamy has acknowledged he could be forced to resign, regardless of who wins the battle for the company.    Mr. Leysen has spent the past few days in Belgium and abroad trying to increase financial commitments to buy the special shares, which are now held by a unit of Generale de Belgique. He has named four other Belgian companies that have agreed to cooperate with him and is expected to name foreign partners soon, perhaps at today's news conference.    A Brussels market source said Mr. Leysen had &quot;no trouble&quot; finding associates to buy all the special shares. Generale de Belgique management agreed to turn eight million to 10 million of the newly issued shares over to Mr. Leysen's group, but it couldn't be determined whether it would also agree to issue the entire 12 million shares to the group. Generale de Belgique had been seeking its own buyers for the shares, but the sources said they were having trouble finding interested parties. </TEXT></DOC>
