When IBM and Merrill Lynch formed the venture in 1984, they said Imnet would first aim at Merrill Lynch's 10,000 account executives, then expand into other markets. Many expected it to provide a stiff test for its competitors. But, critics say, the system turned out to be complicated and expensive, and Merrill Lynch's participation kept potential brokerage house clients away.    When the closing was announced Wednesday, Imnet had only 50 users of its basic system within Merrill Lynch and 50 outside. A more sophisticated system never made it past the testing stage.    Imnet's failure follows problems at two other IBM joint ventures, Satellite Business Systems and Trintex. SBS, a communications carrier that IBM owned with Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., was posting losses of $100 million a year when it was sold to MCI Communications Corp. in 1985. More recently, CBS Inc. withdrew from the unprofitable Trintex videotex venture with IBM and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. IBM and Sears say CBS's move won't affect the venture, but analysts say they have had to scale back their expectations.    &quot;IBM's ventures have been ill conceived,&quot; said Bernell Wright, an analyst with the Link Resources Inc. subsidiary of International Data Corp. &quot;They reflect more a compelling feeling of need to be in a certain marketplace rather than some understanding of how the market operates.&quot; IBM responded that it remains committed to joint ventures.    The Imnet closing reflects the housecleaning going on at IBM, but provides a further embarrassment at a time when IBM is about to report its second consecutive year of lower profit. IBM has said it will take a $250 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter related to an early-retirement program, and will take a series of unspecified charges related to other cost-cutting moves. Neither IBM nor Merrill Lynch will take a material charge related to Imnet, the companies said.    Sources close to the joint venture say the complex software cost more than the brokerage houses were willing to pay. Imnet had been conceived of as a way to go beyond services that provide just raw data on financial markets and to provide a system of personal computers that would let people analyze stock and bond prices and other things. But &quot;it was very much ahead of the state of the art,&quot; said one top official of a major Wall Street firm.    Some on Wall Street also speculated that Merrill Lynch's participation in the venture may have made its brokerage competitors skittish about depending on Imnet for stock market information.    &quot;It's akin to Sears buying from J.C. Penney,&quot; Mr. Wright said.    Neither IBM nor Merrill Lynch would comment on why the venture failed, beyond an IBM statement that &quot;in the current environment the products of Imnet could not be profitably marketed.&quot; Likewise, an IBM spokesman said that &quot;both Merrill Lynch and IBM considered various options regarding their investment in Imnet,&quot; but neither would comment directly on recent rumors that they had been seeking a buyer for it.    Some senior executives at Imnet have complained that the joint venture was plagued by indecision and indifference by both IBM and Merrill Lynch. Managers of the venture routinely went back to the parent companies for authority to make decisions. This, said the executives, often stalled important elements of the project. Important decisions such as pricing and program packages were affected, the executives at the venture said.    They also said that many of those in charge of Imnet had little previous experience in similar projects and were unprepared to handle problems that emerged in the highly technological venture.    Though the companies wouldn't say how much they had invested in Imnet, IBM did say that Imnet had 298 employees, including 16 from IBM and 15 from Merrill Lynch. Those employees will return to IBM and Merrill Lynch, but the remaining will be laid off. IBM said Imnet will continue operating until its contracts expire but will be essentially out of business in 90 days. </TEXT></DOC>
