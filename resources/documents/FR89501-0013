These regulationsallow a bag limit of one fish per day. In addition, a minor change is madeto existing regulation dates for an open bait season on that portion ofthe Naknek River within the park to remain consistent with changing Stateof Alaska (State) regulations. These regulations are necessary to continuesafely accommodating use of the popular Brooks River fishery by anglers,while maintaining a healthy fishery for bear populations which feed there.Current bag limits of 5 salmon and 2 trout_the two species for which theriver is popular_encourage many anglers to keep fish in their immediatepossession or in the nearby area while seeking to fill these catch limits.By providing less opportunity for anglers to retain large bag limits offish in the area, there will be less chance of bear/human conflicts causedby bears associating humans with food. The effect of the regulations willbe to reduce the potential for conflicts between bears and humans in thearea, while protecting the natural fish resources available to bears alongthe Brooks River. This is a primary goal of park management, as statedin the park's General Management Plan (GMP).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Stephen Hurd, Chief Ranger, KatmaiNational Park and Preserve, P.O.

It is not a responseto any known depletion in fish populations or fisheries habitat impairment.It also corrects a conflict between State and Federal laws and regulationsregarding bait fishing along those portions of the Naknek River withinthe park.In the summer of 1987, the National Park Service submitted a proposal tothe State Board of Fisheries for a change in the State fishing regulations.Current State regulations affecting the Brooks River fishery allow fora bag and possession limit of 5 salmon and 2 rainbow trout during the summerfishing season. The National Park Service proposal had the same objectivesas this rulemaking, but differed by being applicable to all rivers withinthe park and preserve, and by changing bag limits for salmon only. It alsodid not address changes to bait fishing regulations for the Naknek River.The Board failed to approve this proposal, based in part on a determinationfrom the Department of Fish and Game that the fishery was healthy and thatthe proposed action addressed other management considerations not in thepurview of the Board. The Board also expressed concern about the largearea covered by the proposal and some confusion about the objectives. Itwas recognized by the Department of Fish and Game at the Board meetingthat the National Park Service had the authority to promulgate regulationsto address the problem:<ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, this is a proposal put in by the park service that encompassesa fairly large chunk of real estate * * * most of which has fairly limitedangling pressure. Salmon stocks, particularly in the Naknek drainage, appearto be healthy and staff [Department of Fish and Game] see no biologicalreason to further limit the sport bag limits there. They're presently fivea day, five in possession in much of that area. The park service has theauthority to do this if they need to * * * (transcript from taped proceedingsof State Fish Board meeting, December 17, 1987; Anchorage, Alaska).</ITAG>Consequently, the bag limit provision of this rulemaking is a modifiedversion of the earlier submission to the State and is specific to the BrooksRiver.The Brooks River and its surrounding aquatic resources are major habitatsfor a diversity of fish and wildlife species. Rainbow trout and salmonare the most abundant fish species in Brooks River. Arctic grayling andArctic char, as well as other species, are also present. This source ofhigh-protein food is of critical importance to bear populations duringtheir short feeding season before hibernation.Because of this diverse ecosystem, the Brooks River is well-known and popularamong both park anglers and visitors interested in being able to view theAlaska brown bear in its natural habitat. Park managers in Katmai havealways been conscious of and concerned about the management of this importantarea. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Pub. L. 96-487)(ANILCA), which added further acreage to the area, mandated that the newpark is <ITAG tagnum="21">to be managed for the following purposes, among others: To protecthabitats for, and populations of, fish and wildlife including * * * highconcentrations of brown/grizzly bears * * * and * * * to maintain unimpairedthe water habitat for significant salmon populations * * * (section 202(2)of ANILCA; 16 U.S.C. 410hh-1(2)).</ITAG>Congress also determined that Katmai should be managed to protect ``recreationalfeatures''. Sport fishing is permitted within national park areas in Alaska(section 1314 of ANILCA; 16 U.S.C. 3202; 36 CFR 2.3, 13.21). Providingfor the use of the Brooks River by recreational anglers and natural predatoractivities of the area's brown bears poses both a resource management problemaffecting the bears and a safety concern for humans.The General Management Plan (GMP) for the park, prepared pursuant to section1301 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3191), addresses specific management responsibilitiesand objectives regarding Brooks River. The plan notes that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Visitors have traditionally come to the Brooks Camp developed areato fish, visit the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, and watch Alaska brownbears in their natural environment. This development and the associatedactivities intrude on prime bear habitat. The result has been potentiallydangerous conflicts between bears and humans in this area. The issue isimpacts on bears while still providing for visitor activities in this portionof the park.</ITAG>The objectives of the bear management plan for Katmai, as stated in theGMP, are:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * to retain a naturally regulated population of brown bears inthe park and to preclude the food-reinforced attraction of bears to peopleand thereby minimize confrontations between bears and people. The plancalls for * * * minimizing human impacts on bear behavior and patternsof habitat use * * *.</ITAG>With the Brooks River being such an important habitat for bear populationsand the nearby Brooks Camp being the major overnight visitor use area inthe park, these objectives are of specific and immediate importance tothis area.Sport fishing along the Brooks River, as well as elsewhere within the park,is regulated by appropriate National Park Service regulations in 36 CFR2.3, 13.21, and 13.66 and by applicable State of Alaska fishing regulations.Current State regulations affecting the Brooks River fishery allow fora bag and possession limit of 5 salmon and 2 rainbow trout during the summerfishing season. Park policy requires that any fish kept is to be immediatelytaken to a nearby fish cleaning house away from the river to be cleanedand stored. This policy reduces the chance of bears obtaining fish caughtby people, thereby learning to associate the easy acquisition of fish withhuman fishermen and disrupting the bear's natural feeding cycle.However, an increasing number of anglers, some who travel into the BrooksRiver area specifically to fish for the maximum legal take, often do nottake their fish directly to the cleaning house, and instead cache fishthey have caught along the shore_a practice that cannot be prevented byany but the most aggressive and costly law enforcement measures. Bearsare then attracted to this food source, encouraging dangerous bear/humaninteractions.This rulemaking amends 36 CFR 13.66, which is specific to Katmai NationalPark and Preserve, by establishing a total daily bag limit of one fish,regardless of species, on the Brooks River. A minor amendment to 36 CFR13.66(a)(1) removes the dates during which bait fishing is allowed alongthe Naknek River to conform with changing State regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effects of Rulemaking</ITAG>These changes have the effect of eliminating the opportunity for anglersto store their catch along the river banks, which tempts bears to feedon the fish, and will help to maintain a healthy fishery for the bears.The immediate effect will be to cause those anglers who fish the BrooksRiver mainly to acquire food to procure their fish elsewhere. Numerousother areas rich in fish resources are available in the nearby vicinityfor these anglers. Sport fishing for enjoyment will not be restricted,and one fish can still be retained if desired. Human safety and the protectionof natural bear populations, both in the short and long term, should begreatly improved. Long term effects will be a continued healthy fisheryresource, a lessening of the chances for bear/human confrontations, andan improvement in the natural feeding habitat for bears. By removing datesfrom the National Park Service regulation for bait fishing, the NaknekRiver bait fishing season will conform with any changes in State law forbait fishing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Options Considered</ITAG>Other management options based on stated management objectives in the GMPwere also considered in development of this rulemaking. These options includeclosing all or portions of the area to human use, restricting the BrooksRiver to catch-and-release angling only, or eliminating angling along theriver during certain time periods or seasons. The rulemaking is in accordancewith stated overall management objectives and is less restrictive thanother options.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>The policy of the National Park Service is, whenever practicable, to affordthe public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Theproposed rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> Vol. 53, No. 152, Monday, August 8, 1988. Writtencomments on the proposed rulemaking were accepted for a 60 day period,through October 7, 1988. In addition, two public hearings, one in Anchorageand one in King Salmon, Alaska, were held during the comment period.Six written comments were received during the comment period. Two lettersreceived were from lodge/air taxi owners and operators who suggested theproposed rulemaking did not restrict the sport fishing enough and suggestedthat Brooks River and others in the park and preserve should be made catchand release only fisheries. The Alaska Field Office of the Sierra Clubwrote a letter supporting the one fish limit. An individual from DutchHarbor, Alaska supported the one fish limit. The Wildlife Legislative Fundof America wrote that they were opposed to the bag limit restriction because:<ITAG tagnum="21">The State of Alaska operates a brown bear river program which is reputedlythe best in the world in the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary not farfrom the locale of your proposed regulatory change. It is my understandingthat this program operates very well without the type of restriction youpropose.</ITAG>This comment was not applicable to the situation and illustrated confusionon the part of the author, i.e., McNeil River sanctuary does not allowany fishing and restricts the number of people allowed to visit the area,who must acquire a permit and be guided at all times.The State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game wrote objecting to theproposed rulemaking stating they were:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * concerned that your new regulation will be ineffective in significantlyreducing or eliminating occurrence of human-bear interactions at the BrooksRiver. This may place unnecessary restriction on sport fishing activitieswithout commensurate benefit.</ITAG>During the summer of 1988, with a temporary restriction which implementeda one fish bag limit for the Brooks River, park personnel noted a significantreduction in the number of bear/human interactions over fish from the previoussummer season. Based on only a single season of observation, the NationalPark Service believes a notable decrease in the potential number of bear/humaninteractions can be achieved with the bag limit reduction as proposed.Four comments were made during the two public hearings. Two commentorswere very much in favor of the proposed rulemaking citing its necessitydue to safety concerns while still continuing to allow sport fishing tooccur in the area. One commentor, representing the Alaska Sport FishingAssociation, was opposed to the rulemaking because it would reduce theopportunities for sport fishermen to retain their catch when there wasno shortage of fish in the river. The fourth commentor suggested zoningthe river so people fishing in that portion of the river near the fishcleaning house could retain a total of 5 fish and those fishing upstream(beyond an identifiable land form), some distance away from the fish cleaninghouse, would have a bag limit of one fish, as proposed. For enforcementreasons, the National Park Service does not see this option as a practicalalternative.Upon further analysis of the proposed rule, and after one season with asimilar temporary restriction in effect, the National Park Service haschosen to modify the proposed rule for clarification purposes. The modificationdeletes the second sentence of andSection; 13.66(b)(3) and adds the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">No person may retain more than one fish per day caught on Brooks River,on the waters between the posted signs 200 yards from the outlet of BrooksLake, or on the water between the posted signs 200 yards from the mouthof Brooks River on Naknek Lake.</ITAG>The second sentence is being deleted anticipating that the State may chosein the future to restrict the bag limit to zero or make the river a catchand release fishery for certain species. Based upon the past summer experience,the National Park Service has found it necessary to define the area withinwhich the bag limit will apply, thus the new wording found in andSection;13.66(b)(3). <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The primary authors of these regulations are: Tony Sisto, Park Ranger;and, Lou Waller, Chief Division of Subsistence, Alaska Regional Office,National Park Service, Anchorage. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements thatrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Other Laws </ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 (February 19, 1981), 46 FR 13193,and certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The economic effects of this rulemaking are local innature and negligible in scope. No person will be prohibited from fishingon the Brooks River under applicable regulations. The National Park Servicehas determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant effecton the quality of the human environment, health, and safety because itis not expected to: <ITAG tagnum="16">(a) Change public angling habits to the extent of adversely affectingthe aquatic or other natural ecosystem; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(b) Introduce noncompatible uses which might compromise the natureand characteristics of the area, or cause physical damage to it; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(c) Conflict with adjacent ownerships or land uses; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(d) Cause a nuisance to adjacent owners or occupants. </ITAG>Based on this determination, this rulemaking is categorically excludedfrom the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA) by Departmental regulations in 516 DM 6 (49 FR 21438). As such,neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statementhas been prepared. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 13 </ITAG>Aircraft, Alaska, National Parks, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Traffic regulations.
