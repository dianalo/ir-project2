Both deaths came in apparentrevenge attacks for the Temple Mount killings.   A third attack occurred in Arab east Jerusalem, where aPalestinian stabbed a policeman. The victim suffered superficialneck wounds, and the assailant was arrested, police and Israel armyradio said.   The attacks were the latest in violence set off by the policeresponse to the Oct. 8 riots on the sacred Temple Mount. TwentyPalestinians were killed by police who opened fire on Arabs who hadpelted Jewish worshipers with rocks.   Since then, five people have been killed and 11 wounded in aseries of revenge attacks by Arabs and Israelis.   In the occupied West Bank today, a Palestinian stabbed a privateIsraeli security guard who was escorting a gasoline truck intoNablus, the army said.   Army radio said the guard was stabbed three times in the back ashe stood on the street. A plainclothes Israeli security officer whowas passing shot the attacker to death, it said. The guard sufferedmoderate wounds.   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus and the surrounding refugeecamps, confining some 130,000 Palestinians to their homes.   Three masked Palestinians announced through a loudspeaker thatthe slain assailant, identified as 18-year-old Haitham Jamla, was amember of Islamic Jihad, a Moslem fundamentalist group outlawed byIsrael on Monday.   The decision to ban the group apparently came after it claimedresponsibility for the stabbing deaths of three Israelis inJerusalem last week. Israel has blamed Islamic Jihad for dozens ofearlier attacks on Jews.   In the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, meanwhile, a bomb explodedin a vegetable store, killing one Arab and wounding two as theytried to assemble the device, police said.   Chaim Selzer, a medic who arrived first at the scene, told armyradio that one of the wounded lost a hand in the explosion. A thirdArab suffered minor injuries, officials said. Both were taken to anearby hospital.   The radio said the three Arabs were employed at the store in theultra-Orthodox suburb and slept there at night, indicating thatthey were from the occupied territories.   Israeli law bars Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Stripfrom staying in Israel overnight. Many Israeli employers sidestepthe law, however, and provide primitive accommodations forPalestinian laborers so they don't have to make the long journeyhome to the West Bank or Gaza every night.   After last week's revenge attacks, Defense Minister Moshe Arensclosed off the occupied lands for four days, barring Palestiniansfrom entering Israel.   On Monday, he announced tougher restrictions to permanently banPalestinians from entering Israel, saying he would block all thosewith records of crime or activities in the 34-month-old Palestinianuprising.   The daily Haaretz said today that about 20,000 would be banned,up from 8,000 now. Among those banned will be Palestinians heldunder emergency regulations that allow them to be jailed for up toa year without charges.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Monday night that Israelwould crack down hard on Arabs attacking Jews.   ``We shall react to them whether they use stones or firebombs,knives or other weapons,'' he told American Jewish fund-raisers.``We shall not expose our citizens to danger. We shall build a wallof steel and love around our people, as we face threats.''   In other violence today, masked assailants shot and killed45-year-old Khalil Hassan Najar in the Gaza Strip refugee camp ofRafah on suspicion he collaborated with Israel, Palestinianreporters said.   The army said police were investigating.   The death brought to 292 the number of Palestinians killed byfellow Arabs in the uprising, most on suspicion of helping Israel.   The death in Nablus brought to 767 the number of Palestinianskilled by Israelis. Fifty-one Israelis have also died in theviolence.</TEXT></DOC>
