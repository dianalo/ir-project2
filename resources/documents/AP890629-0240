It will be up to 8,500 delegates to decide whether the hugeteachers union continues its recent movement into the mainstream ofeducation reform efforts or harks back to the hard-line stands thatprompted repeated broadsides from President Reagan and formerEducation Secretary William Bennett.   The 2 million-member union, the country's largest, is a potentpolitical force with a formidable Washington presence and theability to organize in nearly every nook and cranny of the nation.Reagan and Bennett constantly described it as an obstacle to bettereducation.   NEA President Mary Futrell steps down this summer after sixtumultuous years during which she weathered the conservativeattacks, led the NEA into the reform movement and won overwhelmingaffection from her troops.   On Monday, delegates will choose between two candidates tosucceed her: Keith Geiger, an inside player and experiencednegotiator who as vice president has helped improve the NEA image,and John Wilson, a self-described activist who promises never tocompromise for the sake of ``a good editorial.''   The outcome of the Geiger-Wilson race will be one indication ofwhere the teachers want their union to go. Another clue will comefrom the position the delegates take on public school choice, thecurrent rage among reformers and the primary education causeadvanced by President Bush.   Choice plans allow parents to pick the schools their childrenattend. Some operate within school districts but some let familieschoose any school in the state. In Minnesota, for instance, statemoney follows the students to any new district they choose, but theyhave to provide their own transportation.   Futrell predicts that choice will be ``the most hotly debatedtopic'' at the meeting. Three proposed resolutions on the subjectreflect NEA attitudes ranging from militant opposition to seriousmisgivings.   The hard-liners, led by Wilson supporters in California, proposethat the NEA help state affiliates oppose choice plans and develop anational strategy to fight the concept's spread. Without a nationaleffort against choice, the California affiliate said, ``state andlocal agencies will foster educational discrimination and weakennational commitment to public education.''   At the other end is a more image-conscious resolution proposed bythe NEA board of directors. It says the NEA continues to supportalternative programs in public schools ``for specific purposes.''Deliberately leaving a loophole, it adds that the NEA ``opposesfederal, state or locally mandated choice plans that compromise theassociation's commitment to free, equitable, universal and qualitypublic education for every student.''   The board's proposal is a revision of the third alternative, aresolution on the original NEA conference agenda, with changes itssponsor said make it ``more positive and less restrictive.''   Futrell, at a news conference last week, said the NEA has alwayssupported magnet schools, alternative schools, alternative curriculaand other options.   The board resolution ``basically says we do support some forms ofchoice but we have to be very careful as we look at this new form ofchoice'' to make sure the broader programs do not further segregateschools along racial and economic lines, she said.   Futrell described the California approach as ``very rigid.'' ``Weare hoping they will go with the more moderate position,'' she saidof the delegates.   She hasn't said as much, but Futrell apparently hopes they willgo with Geiger as well. She has tried to steer the union to greaterflexibility on issues ranging from merit pay to teachercertification, restore professional concerns to the NEA agenda andgenerally ply a moderate course that is reflected in her vicepresident's campaign literature and rhetoric.   Futrell said last week she wouldn't make an endorsement unlessthe race wasn't going the way she wanted it to go. So far, she said,it was going her way.   Geiger is reporting endorsements from at least 46 state and localboards of directors or delegate assemblies, including large statessuch as Florida, Pennsylvania and his home state of Michigan. He hasspent the last few years traveling to teacher events large andsmall, in the process winning friends all over the country.   By contrast, Wilson, of Raleigh, N.C., has won support from amajority of his colleagues on the executive committee and majoritieson the budgetary committee and the board of directors.   But neither man's high-powered endorsements may count for muchMonday, when the delegates will file state-by-state into a specialroom at the Washington Convention Center to cast their secretpresidential ballots.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 2</NOTE></DOC>
