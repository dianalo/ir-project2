Reagan's shadow has already shortened for Bush. These days he isseldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from thepresident. Instead, the questions now center on whether hiscandidacy is exerting too much influence over the Reagan WhiteHouse.   Both Bush and Reagan in recent days have fended off suggestionsthat some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effortto help the Bush campaign.   And confronted with public opinion polls showing Bush far behindamong Democrats who voted for Reagan, Bush advisers have nowswitched strategy to make sure that the Reagan shadow doesn'tdisappear altogether.   After first planning no contact at the Republican NationalConvention between Reagan and his vice president, a joint rally isnow scheduled for Tuesday in New Orleans.   It follows an upbeat joint appearance between Reagan and Bush ata rally last Friday for senior administration officials at the OldExecutive Office Building, during which Reagan lavished praise onhis vice president.   If all goes as planned, Bush's transformation into his own manwill be complete when he accepts the Republican presidentialnomination Thursday night at the Republican National Convention,according to aides and GOP consultants.   By the end of the convention, ``all the emphasis is going to beon George Bush and his vice presidential nominee,'' said his chiefof staff, Craig Fuller.   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, said that Bush ``has madea conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to thepresident.''   ``And now that he's running for the president himself, he'stalking about how he feels, what he believes in, and where he wantsto take the country,'' Atwater said.   To be sure, there are some areas in which Bush does not want toput much light between himself and Reagan _ largely the currenteconomic expansion, now in a peacetime record of 69 months, and thefact that most of the world is at peace.   The vice president has been inching away from his closeidentification with administration policies since he and aideshuddled for a week in late May at his vacation home inKennebunkport, Maine. The consensus from his advisers wasnear-unanimous: he had to do more to establish his own agenda.   Since then, Bush has hinted that he would be more aggressive indealing with the Soviets, would enforce civil-rights laws morevigorously, would spend more on education and do more to clean upthe environment than the president he has served for the past 7{years.   He has also proposed many of his own initiatives, including a$2.2 billion child care program, a ban on offshore ocean dumping,and a reorganizaton of the anti-drug effort under the office ofvice president. He also has proposed a new White House ethicsoffice and a ``flexible freeze'' on federal spending.   But most of Bush's moves away from the administration have beencautious, for fear of appearing disloyal.   ``I'm not going to change just to emerge from a shadow,'' he hassaid.   In a recent interview, Bush said he will differ with Reagan whenhe feels he has a different set of goals.   ``I have every intention of saying, here is what we've done andand here are my priorities.   ``But I'm not doing that to quote distance myself, to show myown identity,'' he continued. ``I'm doing it to say, look, here iswhat we've done. Here are the successes, and here are theshortcomings, and here's what George Bush will do.''   Still, Bush's close identification with the administrationcontinues to pose problems for him as Democrats keep driving hometheir ``Where is George?'' slogan.   When the general election campaign heats up after Labor Day,Bush is expected to be hit repeatedly by Democrats for his role _still vague _ in some of the less popular Reagan administrationdecisions, including arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran and pastsupport for Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.   Meanwhile, the impact of Bush's candidacy has already been seenin a number of recent presidential decisions _ including Reagan'sselection last week of a Hispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to beeducation secretary _ fulfilling in advance a Bush campaign pledge.   Reagan filled two other Cabinet vacancies with people on closeterms with Bush, naming former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburghto succeed Edwin Meese as attorney general and Wall Streetinvestment banker Nicholas F. Brady to follow James A. Baker III astreasury secretary. Baker resigned to run Bush's campaign.   The president also yielded to Bush's urgings in deciding toallow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in thepresident's veto of a $299.5 billion defense authorization bill.Reagan also has picked up on some of Bush's campaign themes,including advocating the death penalty for ``drug kingpins.''   ``I don't think it's as much a matter of Bush disagreeing orseparating himself from Reagan as much as demonstrating that hisagenda is a little different,'' said GOP consultant Charlie Black,who is a Bush convention adviser.   And John Sears, another Republican consultant, said: ``The realmoment of truth is when Bush accepts the nomination.''   ``He can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of theReagan administration have brought to the country. And he can provehimself presidential. In his acceptance speech, he can do it all,''Sears said.</TEXT></DOC>
