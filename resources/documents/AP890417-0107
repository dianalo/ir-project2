According to the Agriculture Department, almost one of every sixcigarettes made in the United States in 1988 went to foreignbuyers. More than two of every five pounds of tobacco leaf producedby farmers last year were exported.   Sustained increases in foreign demand have more than offset thecontinued decline in U.S. cigarette use, meaning that thedepartment's annual quotas for flue-cured and burley tobacco havebeen increased for the 1989 season.   In response, tobacco farmers have indicated they intend to plant713,000 acres this year, up 13 percent from 1988. With averageyields, this year's total tobacco harvest could increase by about15 percent.   The department's Economic Research Service says in its latestanalysis that U.S. cigarette production rose about 1 percent in1988 to an estimated 695 billion ``pieces.'' Americans smoked 562.5billion cigarettes last year, about 2 percent fewer than in 1987.   But cigarette exports rose more than 18 percent last year to118.5 billion pieces, while shipments of leaf rose 12 percent to anequivalent of 578 million pounds farm sales weight _ about 17percent of the 1988 tobacco output of 1.35 billion pounds.   ``The United States is the world's leading tobacco exporter aswell as the largest importer,'' the report said.   Back in the early 1960s, the United States exported about 30percent of its tobacco. In recent years, exports accounted for 38percent of the crop. However, there has been a rise in competition,and the U.S. share of the world market has dropped by half _ from a28 percent share in 1970 to 14 percent in 1987.   Last year, the report said, the value of all U.S. tobaccoexports was a record $4.15 billion, up 22 percent from calendar1987, the previous high. The total included $1.25 billion worth ofunmanufactured tobacco and $2.9 billion in products, mostlycigarettes.   According to the Census Bureau, some 105 countries bought U.S.tobacco last year. About 60 percent of the cigarettes went to Asiancountries, while Europe traditionally is the largest buyer of leaf,which is used to blend into domestically produced products.   Despite the recent pickup in leaf exports, they continue to holdbelow the annual levels during most of the 1970s and early 1980s.Higher excise taxes are reducing or slowing the growth of cigarettesales in some countries, the report said. And the high costs ofU.S. tobacco, together with the dollar's strength in the early1980s, prompted some to shift to other sources, notably Brazil andZimbabwe.   Even with comparatively lower U.S. prices since 1985, there isstill ``stiff competition from less expensive foreign stocks,'' thereport said.   Last year, for the first time since 1980, West Germany was theleading buyer of U.S. tobacco leaf, followed by Japan, which wasthe No. 1 market the previous seven years. But that was mainlybecause Japan reduced 1988 imports after buying unusually largequantities the previous year.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A toll-free consumer meat and poultry hotlineoperated by the Agriculture Department generated about 50,000telephone calls last year, most of them asking for informationabout food safety.   Linda Burkholder of the department's Food Safety and InspectionService, the agency that handles meat and poultry inspectionprograms, reports that the number of calls during the fiscal yearthat ended Sept. 30 increased 6 percent from 1987.   Burkholder said about 30,000 of the calls came in during USDA'sregular business hours, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST. After hours and onweekends, callers heard taped educational messages, such as tips onsafe food preparation, suggestions for transporting foods orinformation on product recalls.   ``Approximately 70 percent of callers asked about basic foodsafety,'' she said in the spring issue of USDA's Food Newsmagazine. ``These questions concerned how long a specific meat orpoultry item could be safely stored, how to minimize the risk ofillness from eating raw or lightly cooked eggs or how to judge whenturkey is done.''   About 5 percent of the calls were about salmonella, with mostwanting to know how the bacteria cause food poisoning, while otherswere interested in federal programs designed to control salmonella.   Repeat callers accounted for 12 percent of last year's calls,Burkholder said. The number of the toll-free hotline, now in itsfourth year, is 1-800-535-4555.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bob Bergland, a former secretary ofagriculture and a major voice in support of the nation's ruralelectric cooperatives, has offered a reminder about the role of theRural Electrification Administration.   The REA, an agency of the Agriculture Department, was created inthe 1930s to finance electric power service to the nation'sfarmers. Various administrations have sought to curb or alter itsfunctions.   Bergland, speaking last week at a hearing of a HouseAppropriations subcommittee, urged lawmakers to ``reject outright''current proposals to privatize the agency.   ``REA is a lending program, not a grant program,'' he said.``Last year rural electrics (local cooperatives) borrowed $780million from the government, but they paid back some $4 billion inprincipal and interest.''   Bergland, who was secretary during the Carter administration, isexecutive vice president and general manager of the National RuralElectric Cooperative Association, which represents about 1,000local co-ops.   ``Now is not the time to weaken any component of this delicateinfrastructure'' built as a ``proven partnership between thefederal REA and rural electric co-ops,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
