Dellinger III ofDuke University law school.   He testified at the beginning of two days of hearings by theHouse Judiciary Committee's constitutional law subcommittee on theBush administration's proposed constitutional amendment to ban flagburning.   Dellinger said the nation should beware of any stampede toward anamendment curtailing the rights of dissidents. He said manyAmericans have tolerated freedom of speech when it was painful to doso and changing the system now would be unfair to them.   Johnson ``will have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of hisfetid imagination,'' Dellinger said.   Johnson was arrested in Dallas during the 1984 RepublicanNational Convention following a protest that ended withdemonstrators igniting an American flag authorities said was takenfrom a pole outside a bank building.   He denied he actually ignited the flag, but said he approved theaction and gave speeches during the protest. He claimed he wassingled out for prosecution because Dallas police knew he was amember of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade.   The Supreme Court threw out his conviction in ruling that flagburning is a form of free speech protected by the Constitution.   In a statement at the outset of the hearing, Rep. James F.Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., urged lawmakers to ``be serious and framethe issues as they are in reality _ whether we really want to carvean exception out fo the First Amendment and hold our honored andrevered flag above all else or whether we want to let the flagburners have their way.''   A man who might have made the ruling come out differently, if theSenate had not rejected his nomination to the Supreme Court, isscheduled to testify on Wednesday.   Robert Bork has said he would have upheld the Texas statute if hewere on the court. The man who took the seat Bork would have had _Anthony Kennedy _ provided the fifth vote in the 5-4 majority thatoverturned the flag ruling.   Bork, who is now with a Washington think tank, contends Congressmust now go ahead with a constitutional amendment if it wants toovercome the court's decision.   There's near total agreement in Congress that something must bedone about the ruling. However, there are some, mostly Democrats,who are hesitant to amend the Constitution and especially in a waythat restricts individual rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., plans to bring a simplestatute before the chamber before the August recess. Supporters ofthat approach hope the issue which seemed so urgent at the time ofthe court decision as the Fourth of July holiday approached willfade.   However, President Bush is behind a constitutional amendment thathas already been introduced in the House by Minority Leader BobMichel, R-Ill., and that Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansasplanned to introduce in the Senate.   Many Democrats, remembering last year's presidential campaign inwhich Bush visited a flag factory, fear that voting against theconstitutional amendment will let Republicans portray them in thenext election as somehow less patriotic.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, last weekpromised that both the statute and the constitutional amendmentwould see Senate action. He and Dole have agreed to hold those votesin October.</TEXT></DOC>
