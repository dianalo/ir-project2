Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader ofHezbollah, or Party of God, made the comments just as Iran preparedto enter U.N.-sponsored talks to end its 8-year-old war with Iraq.   Fadlallah, in a sermon Sunday, accused the United States andEurope of using the hostage crisis for political purposes. But healso called for a swift resolution to the problem.   ``We call for a just and practical solution to this problem toachieve a happy ending,'' he said.   ``We are aware that the (hostages) problem has reached such adegree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed upwith its humanitarian aspect.''   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for the militant Shiitefactions holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. NineAmericans are among the captives.   Fadlallah's comments came during a one-hour sermon to Shiitezealots marking the major Moslem feast of al-Adha in south Beirut'sBir el-Abed mosque.   The hostages are widely believed to be held in Hezbollah's HayMadi barracks building about ten blocks from mosque in Beirut'ssouthern suburbs, a Shiite stronghold.   Syria has had some 5,000 troops patrolling most of the southernsuburbs since May 27, but they have stayed away from the immediatearea of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontationthat could imperil the hostages.   Syrian soldiers, however, control all approaches to Hay Madi andman high-rise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks.   It was not clear whether Fadlallah's call signaled abreakthrough for the hostages. He has made similar calls during thepast two years with no results.   ``On the occasion of this feast, we call on all sides to beginacting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect ofthis problem could be resolved,'' he said.   ``We feel pain for the detention (of the hostages) because theissue has humanitarian aspects,'' Fadlallah said.   Fadlallah accused the United States and European nations of``manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons toimpose their dominance on the world.   ``America has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather usedit as a means of political pressure on each country and people thatresist its imperlialist policies,'' he added.   It was Fadlallah's first reference to the hostages issue sinceIran announced July 18 that it was accepting the year-old U.N.Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in its warwith Iraq.   Political observers believe a truce in the war could facilitateefforts for the release of the hostages.   Nine Americans are among the 18 hostages. The longest held isTerry Anderson, 40, chief Mmiddle Eeast correspondent for TheAssociated Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, reached by telephone Sunday at herhome in Cadiz, Ky., said, ``I don't see that it (the holding ofhostages) should be a political issue. It's a human issue.   ``Everything I've been hearing out of the Middle East latelygives us reason to hope and it's been a very, very long time sincewe've had occasion to be hopeful.''</TEXT></DOC>
