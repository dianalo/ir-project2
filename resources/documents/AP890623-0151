The army, meanwhile, warned that it would use force if necessaryto defend Pinochet's right to remain their commander after theDecember vote.   Two major Socialist Party factions and the pro-socialist Partyfor Democracy announced they are setting aside ideologicaldifferences to support Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, in his bid tobe ``the democratic president of all Chileans.''   Aylwin, in a speech accepting the parties' support, emphasizedthe ``urgency for unity'' in the opposition.   ``We have been adversaries in the past,'' the 70-year-old lawyerand former Senate president told his leftist allies. ``But the timehas come to put aside our differences, and work together to rebuilddemocracy.''   As the ceremony came to an end, the dissidents spontaneously sangthe national anthem.   With Friday's endorsements, Aylwin has won support from all themain groups in the 17-party opposition coalition. He will beformally nominated by the entire coalition July 4, said ClaudioVasquez, a coalition leader.   Aylwin, president of the Christian Democratic Party, thecountry's largest, was the opposition's chief spokesman in itssuccessful campaign for Pinochet's defeat in a referendum lastOctober. Voters rejected a military proposal that Pinochet remain inpower until 1997.   The referendum defeat obliged Pinochet, who has ruled since abloody 1973 coup, to call presidential and congressional electionsscheduled for Dec. 14.   The new government is to take power March 11, 1990.   Opinion polls indicate Aylwin is likely to defeat any rightistpro-government candidate. Conservative pro-government forces haveyet to agree on a candidate, but the most probable appears to beSergio Onofre Jarpa, a 68-year-old former senator and interiorminister under Pinochet.   Jarpa, however, has met opposition among the most staunchlypro-Pinochet groups, who support Hernan Buchi, Pinochet's40-year-old former finance minister. Buchi has said he will not runbut is reportedly reconsidering his decision.   Most legal experts say Pinochet is barred from running by aconstitutional clause prohibiting presidential re-election. Althoughhe has flip-flopped on the issue in the past, Pinochet on Tuesdaysaid he would not be a candidate.   Ricardo Lagos, president of the Party for Democracy, said the17-party opposition coalition already has reached ``a globalagreement'' to nominate Aylwin.   ``Chile's interests are above the interests of our parties,''Lagos said. ``We are not going to elect just a president. We aregoing to elect the man who will rebuild a democratic system that hasbeen trampled by the dictatorship.''   If elected, Aylwin said, his government will seek justice for thevictims of human rights violations under the Pinochet government andpunishment for those found responsible.   ``That is an open wound which will not heal unless the truth isdiscovered and justice is achieved,'' Aylwin said. ``But we'll seekjustice, not revenge.''   The opposition has said Pinochet must relinquish command of thepowerful 60,000-member armed forces.   But in statement read Friday by Col. Fritz Ladevig, the army saidit ``has the unavoidable mission to safeguard the constitutionalorder, either through respresentations or, in their absence, throughthe use of legitimate force.''   The constitution, pushed through by Pinochet's administration in1980, allows all armed forces chiefs to remain in their posts foreight more years.</TEXT></DOC>
