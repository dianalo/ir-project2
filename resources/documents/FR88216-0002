Holmes, Operations Officer,Domestic and Emergency Operations Staff, PPQ, APHIS, USDA, Room 661, FederalBuilding, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, 301-436-6365.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>We are amending the ``Domestic Quarantine Notices'' in 7 CFR Part 301 byadding ``Melon Fly'' regulations (referred to below as the regulations).These regulations quarantine part of Los Angeles County, California becauseof the melon fly, and restrict the interstate movement of regulated articlesfrom the quarantined area.The melon fly, <T3>Dacus cucurbitae </T3>(Coquillet), is a very destructive pest of fruitsand vegetables, including melons, mangos, peppers, squash, cucumbers, beans,eggplant, tomatoes, apples, oranges, peaches, and pears. This pest cancause serious economic losses by lowering the yield and quality of thesefruits and vegetables, and by damaging the seedlings and young plants ofsquash, melons, and cucumbers. Heavy infestations can result in completeloss of these crops.Recent trapping surveys near El Segundo, California, have established thatpart of Los Angeles County is infested with the melon fly.Officials of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, or theDepartment) and state and county agencies in California have begun an intensivesurvey and eradication program in the infested area. Also, as explainedbelow, California has restricted the intrastate movement of certain articlesfrom the quarantined area to prevent the spread of the melon fly withinCalifornia. However, Federal regulations are necessary to restrict theinterstate movement of certain articles from the quarantined area to preventthe spread of the melon fly to noninfested areas in other states. Thisinterim rule establishes those Federal regulations, which are describedbelow.Section 301.97 Prohibitions.This section prohibits the interstate movement of regulated articles fromquarantined areas except in accordance with the regulations.Section 301.97-1 Definitions.This section defines the following terms: ``Administrator,'' ``Certificate,''``Compliance Agreement,'' ``Departmental Permit,'' ``Infestation,'' ``Inspector,''``Interstate,'' ``Limited permit,'' ``Moved,'' ``Melon Fly,'' ``Person,''``Plant Protection and Quarantine,'' ``Quarantined area,'' ``Regulatedarticle,'' and ``State.''In particular, an ``infestation'' is defined as set forth below. In orderto develop accurate criteria for determining when an infestation of melonfly exists, APHIS has consulted with fruit fly experts within the USDA'sAgricultural Research Service, with state universities, and with statedepartments of agriculture. (Copies of this information and a list of supportingreferences are available by writing to USDA, APHIS, PPQ, National Programs,Room 663, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland,20782.) The consensus of these experts is that there is an infestationof melon fly when any of the following is present:1. One melon fly larva, because its presence indicates that at least onesuccessful mating has occured, resulting in propagation of a new generation.2. One melon fly pupa, because its presence indicates that at least onesuccessful mating has occurred, resulting in propagation of a new generation.3. One mated adult female melon fly, because its presence indicates theexistence of other, undiscovered adult melon flies and the possibilitythat the captured fly may have deposited eggs before being discovered.4. Two or more adult melon flies collected from within a 3-mile radius,within one melon fly life cycle, because their presence indicates the existenceof other, undiscovered adult melon flies in close proximity during a timeperiod when a successful mating could occur. With regard to most otherexotic fruit flies, an infestation is considered to exist if more thanfive unmated adult fruit flies are found in an area significantly smallerthan the 3-mile radius established for the melon fly. Fruit fly expertsbelieve a lower threshold is necessary for melon fly because of the melonfly's ability to migrate at a faster rate than other fruit flies.Section 301.97-2 Regulated articles.Certain articles present a significant risk of spreading the melon flyif they are moved from quarantined areas without restriction. We call thesearticles regulated articles. This section designates as regulated articlesthe melon fly and a number of fruits, vegetables, and berries, and soilwithin the drip line of plants that produce the fruits, vegetables, andberries. In addition, this section allows designation of any other product,article, or means of conveyance as a regulated article, if an inspectordetermines that it presents a risk of spread of the melon fly and notifiesthe person in possession of the product, article, or means of conveyancethat it is subject to the restrictions in the regulations. This last provisionfor ``any other product, article, or means of conveyance'' allows an inspectorwho discovers a risk of spreading melon fly (e.g., a truck with melon flypupae in cracks in the floorboards) to regulate the product, article, ormeans of conveyance immediately, by informing the person in possessionof the product, article, or means of conveyance that it is being regulated.Fruits, vegetables, or berries that are canned, or dried, or frozen below^17.8 anddegrees;C. (0 anddegrees;F.) are not included as regulated articles,since the melon fly cannot survive under those conditions.  Section 301.97-3 Quarantined areas.  This section states that the following areas will be listed as quarantinedareas: (1) Each state in which an infestation of melon fly exists, or (2)a 169-square-mile area within a state or status surrounding the focal pointof a melon fly infestation. The Administration may establish boundariesencompassing more or less than an 169-square-mile area, when he or shedetermines it is necessary to do so to establish readily identifiable boundaries. This 169-square-mile quarantined area is larger than that established formost species of fruit flies. In the case of most fruit fly infestations,the quarantined area encompasses only 81 square miles. However, researchhas shown that the female melon fly usually migrates farther than otherfruit flies. (Copies of this research information and a list of supportingreferences are available by writing to USDA, APHIS, PPQ, National Programs,Room 663, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland,20782.) Consequently, the regulated area for melon fly is 169 square milesinstead of 81 square miles.  Also, from a purely biological standpoint, the quarantined area would mosteffectively be measured as a circle, with the point of detection at itscenter, rather than in terms of square miles. However, the need for clarityin describing the regulated area usually dictates that natural and man-madeboundaries that circumscribe the biological circle be chosen as the boundariesfor the quarantined area. Consequently, the quarantined area usually resemblesa square and is measured in square miles.  Section 301.97-3 also provides that we will designate less than an entirestate as a quarantined area only if we determine that: (1) The state hadadopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulatedarticles, and the restrictions are substantially the same as those imposedby the regulations on the interstate movement of those articles; and (2)quarantining less than the entire state will prevent the interstate spreadof the melon fly. These determinations would indicate that infestationsare confined to the quarantined areas and eliminate the need for designatingan entire state as a quarantined area.  In accordance with these criteria, we have quarantined the following areaof Los Angeles County:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Los Angeles County:</T3> That portion of the county bounded by a linedrawn as follows: beginning at the point where Moss Avenue intersects thePacific Ocean coastline; then northeasterly along this avenue to its intersectionwith State Highway 1; then northeasterly along this highway to its intersectionwith Interstate Highway 10; then easterly along this highway to its intersectionwith Western Avenue; then south along this avenue to its intersection withTorrance Boulevard; then west along this boulevard to its intersectionwith Catalina Avenue; then due west along an imaginary line from that intersectionto the Pacific Ocean coastline; then northwesterly along this coastlineto the point of beginning.</ITAG>We have not quarantined the entire state of California because the melonfly has not been found in other areas of the state, and because Californiahas adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement ofregulated articles, and the restrictions are substantally the same as thoseimposed by the regulations on the interstate movement of those articles. Section 301.97-3 also provides that we may quarantine an area without publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, if there is a reason to designate the area asa quarantined area in accordance with this section. After we give the owneror person in possession of the area written notice of the quarantine, interstatemovement of any regulated article from the area will be subject to theregulations. This provision is necessary to prevent the spread of the melonfly during the time between discovery of the pest and the time a documentquarantining the area can be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.  Section 301.97-4 Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulatedarticles from quarantined area  This section requires most regulated articles moved interstate from quarantinedareas to be accomplished by a certificate or a limited permit. The onlyexceptions are certain articles that move into the quarantined area fromoutside the quarantined area or that are moved by the Department for experimentalor scientific purposes.  Except for articles moved by the Department, only articles that are movedinto the quarantined area from outside the quarantined area and that areaccompanied by a waybill that indicates the point of origin may be movedinterstate without a certificate or limited permit. Additionally, the articlesmust be moved in an enclosed vehicle or be completely enclosed so as toprevent access by melon files. In most cases, except as explained belowregarding Los Angeles International Airport, California, the regulatedarticles must also move through the quarantined area without stopping (exceptfor refueling, rest stops, emergency repairs, and for traffic conditionssuch as traffic lights and stop signs) and the regulated articles mustnot be unpacked or unloaded in the quarantined area.We are including special provisions for regulated articles that transitLos Angeles International Airport as air cargo or as meals for aircraftpassengers and crews. If these articles are moved into the quarantinedarea from outside the quarantined area and are enclosed or covered as specifiedabove, they may be moved interstate without a certificate or limited permit,and not be subject to the regulations regarding stopping, unpacking, andunloading. Although Los Angeles International Airport is in the quarantinedarea, with proper covering or enclosure, regulated articles that are movedinto the quarantined area from outside the quarantined area and that moveas air cargo or meals through the airport can be interstate without a significantrisk of spreading the melon fly.Also, the Department may move regulated articles interstate without a certificateor limited permit if the articles are moved for experimental or scientificpurposes. However, the articles must be moved in accordance with a Departmentpermit issued by the Administrator, under conditions that prevent the spreadof the melon fly.andSection; 301.97-5 Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limitedpermits.Under federal domestic plant quarantine programs, there is a differencebetween the use of certificates and limited permits. Certificates are issuedfor regulated articles when an inspector finds that, because of certainconditions (e.g., the article is free of melon fly), there is no pest riskbefore movement. Regulated articles accompanied by a certificate can bemoved interstate without further restrictions. Limited permits are issuedfor regulated articles when an inspector finds that, because of a possiblepest risk, the articles may be safety moved interstate only subject tofurther restrictions, such as movement to limited areas and movement forlimited purposes. Section 301.97-5 explains the conditions for issuinga certificate or limited permit.Specifically, andSection; 301.97-5(a) provides that a certificate will beissued by an inspector for the movement of a regulated article if the inspectordetermines that the article: (1) Is free of melon fly, has been treatedunder the supervision of an inspector, who must be present during the treatment,in accordance with andSection; 301.97-10, or comes from a premises of originthat is free of melon fly and the regulated article has not been movedfrom the premises of origin since November 20, 1987; (2) will be movedin compliance with any additional emergency conditions deemed necessaryto prevent the spread of melon fly under 7 U.S.C. 150dd: and (3) is eligiblefor unrestricted movement under all other federal domestic plant quarantinesand regulations applicable to that article. We have included a footnote (number 1) that provides an address for securingthe addresses and telephone numbers of the local Plant Protection and Quarantineoffices at which services of inspectors may be requested. We have alsoincluded a footnote (number 2) that explains that the Secretary of Agriculturecan, under 7 U.S.C. 150dd, take emergency actions to seize, quarantine,treat, destory, or apply other remedial measures to articles that he orshe has reason to believe are infested or infected by or contain plantpests.Section 301.97-5(b) provides for the issuance of a limited permit (in lieuof a certificate) by an inspector for interstate movement of a regulatedarticle if the inspector determines that the article is to be moved toa specified destination for specified handling, utilization or processing,and that the movement will not result in the spread of melon fly.Section 301.97-5(c) allows any person who has entered into and is operatingunder a compliance agreement to issue a certificate or limited permit forthe interstate movement of a regulated article after an inspector has determinedthat the article is eligible for a certificate or limited permit underandSection; 301.97-5 (a) or (b).Also, andSection; 301.97-5(d) contains provisions for the withdrawal of acertificate or limited permit by an inspector if the inspector determinesthat the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied withconditions for the use of the document. This section also contains provisionsfor notifying the holder of the reasons for the withdrawal and for holdinga hearing if there is any conflict concerning any material fact.Section 301.97-6 Compliance agreement and cancellation.Section 301.97-6 provides for the issuance and cancellation of complianceagreements. Compliance agreements are provided for the convenience of personswho are involved in interstate shipments of regulated articles from quarantinedareas. A compliance agreement will be issued when an inspector has determinedthat the person requesting the compliance agreement is knowledgeable regardingthe requirements of andSection; 301.97, and the person has agreed to complywith those requirements. This section contains a footnote (number 3) toexplain how compliance agreements may be arranged.Section 301.97-6 also provides that an inspector may cancel the complianceagreement upon finding that a person who has entered into the agreementhas failed to comply with any of the provisions of the regulations. Theinspector will notify the holder of the compliance agreement of the reasonsfor cancellation and offer an opportunity for a hearing to resolve anyconflicts of material fact.Section 301.97-7 Assembly and inspection of regulated articles.Section 301.97-7 provides that any person (other than a person authorizedto issue certificates or limited permits under andSection; 301.97-5(c)) whodesires a certificate or limited permit to move regulated articles mustrequest, at least 48 hours before the desired interstate movement, thatan inspector issue a certificate or limited permit. The regulated articlemust be assembled wherever and in whatever way the inspector designatesas necessary to comply with the regulations.Section 301.97-8 Attachment and inspection of regulated Articles.Section 301.97-8 requires the certificate or limited permit issued formovement of the regulated article to be attached, during the interstatemovement, to the regulated article, or to a container carrying the regulatedarticle, or to the accompanying waybill. Further, the section requiresthat the carrier must furnish the certificate or limited permit to theconsignee at the destination of the regulated article. These provisions are necessary for enforcement purposes and to ensure thatpersons desiring inspection services can obtain them before the intendedmovement date.Section 301.97-9 Costs and charges.Section 301.97-9 explains the APHIS policy that services of an inspectorthat are needed to comply with the provisions of the quarantine and regulationsin andSection; 301.97 are provided without cost between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,Monday through Friday, except holidays, to persons requiring those services,but that we will not be responsible for any other costs or charges (suchas overtime costs for inspections conducted at times other than between8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays). Section 301.97-10 Treatments.Section 301.97-10 sets forth treatment schedules that qualify soil andregulated articles for issuance of certificates as provided in andSection;301.97-5. For instance, it has been determined_based on research by theAgricultural Research Service_that the following diazinon treatment woulddestroy the melon fly in soil:<ITAG tagnum="21">Soil within the drip area of plants that are producing or have producedthe fruits, vegetables, and berries listed in andSection; 301.97-2(a) ofthis subpart: Apply diazinon at the rate of 5 pounds active ingredientper acre to the soil within the drip area, with sufficient water to wetthe soil to at least a depth of \1/2\ inch.</ITAG>Treatments authorized for use in destroying melon fly on regulated articlesare listed in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, whichis incorporated by reference. See andSection; 300.1 of this chapter, ``Materialsincorporated by reference.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Action </ITAG>The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service hasdetermined that an emergency situation exists, which warrants publicationof this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Becausethe melon fly could spread to noninfested areas of the United States, itis necessary to act immediately to prevent its spread.Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseemergency conditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 for makingthis interim rule effective upon signature. We will consider comments postmarkedor received within 60 days of publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Any amendments we make to this interim ruleas a result of these comments will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as soon as possible following the close of thecomment period. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act.</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on completion, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.Within the quarantined area, there are fewer than 250 small entities thatmay be affected, including 53 nurseries, 150 mobile fruit vendors, 30 fruitstands, 5 fruit wholesalers, and 8 companies catering to airlines. Mostof the sales by the fruit vendors and fruit stand operators are local intrastateand will not be affected by the quarantine. Effects on the nurseries willbe minimized by the availability of soil treatment under the regulations.Effects on the fruit wholesalers will be minimized by the availabilityof treatments for many of the regulated articles. Effects on the catererswill be negligible, because virtually all of their food products intendedfor interstate movement originate outside the quarantined area and, properlyhandled, will be permitted to be moved onto aircraft without a certificateor limited permit.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that the action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in the subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>The program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.(See 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V.)<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301</ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases, Plant pests, Plants (Agriculture),Quarantine, Transportation, Melon Fly.Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 301 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES</ITAG>1.
