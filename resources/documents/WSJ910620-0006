At the request of unsecured creditors, bankruptcy judgesin two recent cases have reshuffled the usual order of payingclaims and allowed unsecured creditors to get in line beforesecured lenders. Now, lawyers say, many more such challengesare expected.</LP><TEXT>   The decisions in the recent cases in Boston andPhiladelphia have attracted the attention of bankers andbankruptcy lawyers and have shed light on a little-noticeddoctrine known as equitable subordination. This provision ofthe federal Bankruptcy code allows judges wide discretion tomove unsecured creditors ahead of secured lenders if thoselenders have misused their economic clout over the debtor orotherwise acted unfairly.   A secured lender is one that has a right to payouts fromspecific assets pledged to it as security by the borrower. Incontrast, an unsecured creditor -- often a supplier of goodsor services -- holds no collateral. In bankruptcy court,where no debts can be paid without the approval of a judge,lenders ordinarily are given priority in recognition of thesecured nature of their original loan.   With the two recent cases turning that arrangement on itshead, bankruptcy lawyers expect a rash of new challenges byunsecured creditors, even though successful bids to havesecured debt subordinated have been rare. The tactic islikely to be particularly attractive to unsecured creditorsin the complex bankruptcy proceedings of failed leveragedbuy-outs, these lawyers say.   &quot;Its a hot thing,&quot; says Harvey Miller, head of thebankruptcy practice at the New York law firm Weil, Gotshal andamp;Manges. Unsecured creditors target banks &quot;because they'reviewed as deep pockets and the only source of recourse,&quot; hesays. &quot;People who find themselves at the bottom of the totempole {have} nothing to loose by bringing this action.&quot;   Often, too, equitable subordination cases are filed simplyto try to force secured creditors into a settlement that ismore favorable to unsecured creditors, lawyers say.   &quot;I think it can be used as a negotiating tactic, but thesophisticated lender who has acted properly shouldn't haveanything to worry about,&quot; says Steven Gerard, a seniormanaging director at Citibank.   The allegations made in the case decided in Philadelphialast week were typical of those in traditional equitablesubordination cases. A bankruptcy judge ruled that a securedlender, MNC Commercial Corp. of Baltimore, had used&quot;surreptitious and misleading methods&quot; to determine when tostop making loans to the debtor, M. Paolella andamp; Sons, aPhiladelphia tobacco and candy distributor. Partly as aresult of the lender's actions, the judge determined, thecompany failed. In the interests of fairness, the judgetherefore moved unsecured claims totaling $1.9 million aheadof MNC's claims.   But many bankruptcy lawyers predict that judges willincreasingly use equitable subordination as punishment in anew area: fraudulent conveyance. In these cases, plaintiffstypically argue that people who benefited from a leveragedbuy-out that later went bust did so with the knowledge -- orreason to know -- that the resulting company wouldn't be ableto survive.   In May, a Boston bankruptcy judge presiding over thebankruptcy of O'Day Corp. put the claims of unsecuredcreditors ahead of those of Meritor Savings Bank ofPhiladelphia, which had financed the 1987 leveraged buy-outof the Fall River, Mass., sailboat maker. U.S. BankruptcyJudge James N. Gabriel ruled that Meritor's $8 million inloans constituted a fraudulent conveyance because the bankshould have known the buy-out would leave the companyinsolvent.   Theoretically, the claims of lenders that have engaged ina fraudulent conveyance can legally be abolished, says JamesD. McGinley of the Boston office of law firm Edwards andamp;Angell. But many judges find that remedy &quot;too extreme formost bankruptcy purposes,&quot; Mr. McGinley says. They find thatsubordinating some or all of the lender's debt is a lessDraconian alternative.   Last year, for example, Mr. McGinley represented acourt-appointed trustee in the bankruptcy of the operator of28 Burger King restaurants in New Hampshire andMassachusetts. The bankruptcy judge ruled that when a groupof insurers, including Travelers Insurance Co., refinancedErin Foods Services Inc., a portion of that money wasimproperly used by Erin's owner for other business interests.The judge subordinated $5.8 million of the insurer's claimbut ruled that the group's $55.9 million claim remainedsecured.   &quot;It was using equitable subordination as a remedy toobtain the judge's objective, which was to place our claimsbelow other creditors but not wipe it out all together,&quot; saysEvan D. Flaschen, of the Hartford, Conn., law firm Hebb andamp;Gitlin, who represented the insurers.   The fear of many bankruptcy lawyers who represent securedlenders is that the rationales used by judges in decidingequitable subordination litigation are becoming vague andthat the judges are reordering claims according to personaldefinitions of fairness.   &quot;A recent and possibly disturbing trend is that somecourts have suggested that you don't need inequitableconduct,&quot; says Mr. Flaschen. &quot;It is a frightening thing forlenders because there's no real standard there. It's at thejudge's discretion.&quot;   A federal appeals court in Chicago last year upheld alower court's decision to subordinate a $68,022 tax penaltyclaim by the Internal Revenue Service against Virtual NetworkServices Corp., a long-distance telephone services companythat had filed for bankruptcy-court protection. The courtruled that judges can equitably subordinate claims &quot;on acase-by-case basis without requiring in every instanceinequitable conduct on the part of the creditor claimingparity among other unsecured general creditors.&quot;   Lawyers for secured lenders derive hope, however, from afederal appeals court ruling in New Orleans, in thebankruptcy proceedings of Clark Pipe andamp; Supply Co., thatlimited equitable subordination to situations in which thelender engaged in &quot;inequitable conduct such as fraud,misrepresentation&quot; or oppressive control over the company'sdecision making.   ---   FORMER MILKEN AIDE is dropped as defendant in junk-bondfraud suit.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. dismissed James Dahl,formerly one of Michael Milken's top aides at Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc., as a defendant in the case. The lawsuit, whichseeks $6 billion in damages, alleges that Mr. Milken andother Drexel officials were partly responsible for thesavings-and-loan debacle.   The FDIC agreed to drop its case against Mr. Dahl, who wasconsidered Drexel's top junk-bond salesman, in return for hiscooperation in the case. Mr. Milken, formerly head ofDrexel's junk-bond department, is currently serving a prisonsentence for securities-law violations. Mr. Dahl alsocooperated with prosecutors in the criminal case.   ---   BAN ON SALE of Beamish Irish stout in U.S. is rejected onappeal.   The federal appeals court in Manhattan vacated alower-court ruling that Beamish stout infringed on thetrademark of Jim Beam Brands Co. The Second U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals in Manhattan said the court didn'tadequately consider whether the Beamish andamp; Crawford Ltd. brandname is likely to confuse consumers. Jim Beam, an AmericanBrands Inc. unit, doesn't make a stout beer but claimed theBeamish name was too similar to the Jim Beam brand name forwhiskey and bourbon.   Both Beamish and Jim Beam have used their brand namessince the late 18th century. But Beamish stout has been soldin the U.S. only since 1950.   ---   INTERNATIONAL TIES: Dixon andamp; Dixon, a 35-attorney firmbased in Omaha, Neb., will soon begin practicing law in thePersian Gulf area in affiliation with a 16-attorney KuwaitCity law firm, Faris andamp; Najeeb Al-Waqyan.
