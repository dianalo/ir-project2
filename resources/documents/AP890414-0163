Also on Friday, territorial officials said 13 guerrillas havebeen killed in battles with security forces.   It was the first official report of fighting between SouthAfrican-led security forces and guerrillas of the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization since last weekend, when the two sides agreedSWAPO fighters would safely withdraw from Namibia.   Gerhard Roux, spokesman for administrator Louis Pienaar, saidsecurity forces also found the bodies of another six insurgents inthe bush of northern Namibia this week. But he said it is not knownwhen they died.   Paramilitary police and soldiers killed five guerrillas in aThursday confrontation and two on Tuesday, Roux told reporters.   Fighting erupted April 1, the first day of a cease-fire startinga yearlong U.N. process to make Namibia independent. Since then,territorial officials say, 276 guerrillas and 27 security forcemembers have been killed. SWAPO says its losses are much lower andcharges one-fifth of those killed were civilians.   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Friday that 1,600guerrillas have infiltrated into northern Namibia from Angola sinceApril 1 and must be accounted for before the independence processcan move ahead.   Of those, about 350 have withdrawn from Namibia, 22 have beencaptured, and about 900 remain in the territory, Botha said.   No explanation was given for his new estimate of 1,600infiltrators, down from 1,900.   The incursion has jeopardized plans to hold independenceelections in November, Botha has said.   Last weekend, South African, Cuban and Angolan officialsnegotiated safe passage back to Angola for guerrillas who report toU.N.-monitored checkpoints.   The previous deadline for the guerrilla withdrawal was Saturday.   As of Friday evening, however, only five guerrillas hadreported. Others who withdrew apparently did so on their own.   U.N. official Cedric Thornberry said Thursday the insurgentsprobably are reluctant to surface because of the ``menacingpresence'' of security forces near U.N. assembly points.   The cease-fire has not been reinstated since last week'sfighting, the fiercest in the 23-year war, although South Africasays its forces will fire at guerrillas only if attacked.   Botha also agreed with the United Nations that South Africansoldiers not be allowed to interrogate guerrillas who report to thecheckpoints. Some South African soldiers tried to get access tofour guerrillas at a checkpoint Thursday, but Australian andBritish members of the U.N. monitoring force rebuffed them.   U.N. investigators have supported South Africa's contention thatthe guerrillas violated an accord requiring they stay at Angolanbases at least until May 15, when they could enter Namibia asunarmed refugees.   Exiled SWAPO President Sam Nujoma has called on his fighters towithdraw but has not told them to report to the checkpoints.   South Africa has ruled this mineral-rich territory since itcaptured it from Germany in World War I. In December, it agreed tobegin a transition to independence in exchange for Cuba withdrawing50,000 troops from Angola.   SWAPO has fought South African rule since 1966 and is favored toget the most votes in independence elections. But it is uncertainwhether it will get the two-thirds support needed to win fullcontrol of a new government.</TEXT></DOC>
