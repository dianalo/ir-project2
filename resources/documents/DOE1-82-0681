Aportion of the human 125I-C3a that binds to guinea pig platelets is competitivelydisplaced by excess unlabeled C3a; however, the majority of ligand uptakewas nonspecific. Uptake of 125I-C3a by guinea pig platelets is maximalin 1 min, and stimulation of guinea pig platelets by thrombin, ADP, orthe Ca2+ ionophore A23187 showed little influence on binding of the ligand.Scatchard analysis indicated that approximately 1200 binding sites forC3a exist per cell with an estimated Kd of 8 x 10(-10) M. Human C3a desArg also binds to guinea pig platelets, but Scatchard analysis indicatedthat no specific binding occurred. Because the ligand-binding studieswere complicated by high levels of nonspecific uptake, we attempted tochemically cross-link the C3a molecule to a specific component on theplatelet surface. Cross-linkage of 125I-C3a to guinea pig platelets withbis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate revealed radioactive complexes at 105,000and 115,000 m.w. on SDS-PAGE gels by autoradiographic analysis. In thepresence of excess unlabeled C3a, complex formation was inhibited. Nocross-linkage could be demonstrated between the inactive 125I-C3a desArg and the putative C3a-R on guinea pig platelets. Human C3a, but notC3a des Arg induces serotonin release and aggregation of the guinea pigplatelets. Human C3a was unable to induce either serotonin release orpromote aggregation of human platelets. Uptake of human 125I-C3a by humanplatelets was not saturable, and Scatchard analysis was inconclusive.Attempts to cross-link 125I-C3a to components on the surface of humanplatelets also failed to reveal a ligand-receptor complex. Therefore,we conclude that guinea pig platelets have specific surface receptorsto C3a and that human platelets appear devoid of receptors to the anaphylatoxin.</TEXT></DOC>
