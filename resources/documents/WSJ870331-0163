That's typical of the undemocratic attitudes of the advocates of a convention. Nobody knows how the delegates would be selected because Article V doesn't tell us. Nor is there any law to guide us. It's all a plunge into the unknown.    The &quot;unknowables&quot; are even greater when we consider what would happen if a convention were ever convened. What would be its agenda, its limitations, its rules? No doubt Congress, after divisive debate, would attempt to legislate those matters, but nobody knows what legislative compromises would result, and if the convention delegates would acquiesce in Congress's dictation.    The stage is then set for the factions among convention delegates, elected with different purposes in mind, to trade and compromise with each other: You vote to put my amendment on the agenda, and we'll vote for yours.    The entire process is subject to court challenge, from the validity of the 34 state-legislative resolutions, through the election process and apportionment of delegates, to the procedure and actions of the convention itself. Do we really want to toss all those issues into the lap of the U.S. Supreme Court?    Meanwhile, the image would be presented to the world of the U.S. (already damaged by the Iran-contra incident) suddenly deciding to reexamine its national identity. Our Constitution would be on the bargaining table, tugged at by special-interest groups, each with its own package of changes. These groups come from both the right and the left, and they are drooling at the possibility of rewriting the Constitution to achieve their own goals.    Mr. Anderson pompously pooh-poohs the danger of a &quot;runaway&quot; convention. Yet the only precedent we have was indeed a runaway convention. The great Constitutional Convention of 1787 was called for the express purpose of amending the Articles of Confederation. Once in Philadelphia, the Founding Fathers threw out that document, wrote the U.S. Constitution, and even changed the ratification procedure in order to make sure it would be adopted.    If a 1987 convention emulated the Founding Fathers as, indeed, some interest groups have been urging, the delegates might not only change our structure of government, but could also change the ratification procedure. Unlike other elected federal officials, Constitutional Convention delegates are not required to take an oath to support our present Constitution.    Some of the most prestigious authorities in the country say it is impossible to limit the agenda of a Constitutional Convention. Retired Chief Justice Warren Burger said recently in Detroit, &quot;There is no way to put a muzzle on a Constitutional Convention.&quot; The Stanford Law School professor whose textbook is currently used in two-thirds of U.S. law schools, Gerald Gunther, said that, even if Congress tried to limit the convention to one subject, the delegates could decide for themselves that the convention &quot;is entitled to set its own agenda.&quot;    Some lawyers argue the opposite. Nobody can say for sure what the outcome would be, but it's not worth the risk. Any proposal for constitutional change should be addressed on its own merits, not made hostage to contention and compromise at a convention whose delegates bear no responsibility because they never have to run for reelection.
