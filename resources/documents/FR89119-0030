The existing regulations provide no clear guidance as to theadmissibility of evidence in administrative proceedings, resulting in uncertaintyas to which documents and testimony may constitute the record in a particularmatter.

The Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Departmentof Labor modify the Federal Rules of Evidence for application in formaladversarial adjudications conducted by the United States Department ofLabor. The civil non-jury nature of the hearings and the broad underlyingvalues and goals of the administrative process are given recognition inthese rules. Comments are requested as to whether uniform rules are appropriatefor administrative proceedings.Text to be deleted from the Federal Rules marked by brackets andCx.19; andCx.20;.Text to be added is enclosed by arrowsandCx.22; andCx.21;. Where the FederalRules refer to the court, the Proposed Rules refer to the judge, meaningthe Administrative Law Judge or other presiding officer. Federal Rulesreferring to criminal proceedings have been deleted.The Federal Rules of Evidence differ with the Federal Rules of Evidencein certain areas. Significant changes explained by the Reporter's Notesare set forth in the Appendix to the rules. Comments are particularly requestedon whether these changes should be made.Proposed andSection; 18.103(a) requires the party to make a proper objectionto evidence which is considered inadmissible, and no error will be committedif the judge explicitly states that he or she does not rely on such evidencein support of the decision or order.Proposed andSection; 18.201(b)(1) allows for official notice of facts notsubject to reasonable dispute if generally known within the local area;whereas, the Federal Rule requires the fact to be generally known in theterritorial jurisdiction of the trial court. This section also allows forofficial notice of generally recognized scientific, medical or other technicalfacts within the administrative agency's specialized field of knowledge.The Federal Rules provide for the applicability of State law with regardto presumptions (Rule 302), privileges (Rule 501), and competency of witnesses(Rule 601). The Proposed Rules incorporate the relevant history of theserules and anticipate that State law will only rarely need be applied. SeeProposed andSection;andSection; 18.302, 18.501, and 18.601.The Federal Rules provide for the exclusion of evidence based on the dangerof unfair prejudice (Rule 403), and for the exclusion of evidence of convictionof a crime for the purposes of impeachment based on the danger of unfairprejudice (Rule 609). Such a concept is unnecessary where the trier offact is the administrative law judge or other presiding officer. See proposedandSection;andSection; 18.403 and 18.609.Proposed andSection;andSection; 18.803(a)(28), and 18.902(a)(14), regardingthe hearsay exception for and self-authentication of written reports ofexpert witnesses, require that a summary of the expert's litigation experiencebe included. Several hearsay exceptions and self-authentication provisionshave been added. See proposed andSection;andSection;18.803(a)(25)-(30), and18.902(a)(11)-(16). The Reporter's Notes to proposed andSection;andSection;18.803 and 18.902 (Hearsay Exceptions and Self-Authentication) indicatethat the question of payment of witness fees is not covered.Proposed andSection; 18.1101(b)(2) states that the Rules of Evidence areinapplicable to cases arising under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 901, <T3>et seq</T3>., and its extensions, and to cases arising under the FederalCoal Mine Health and Safety Act, as amended by the Black Lung BenefitsAct, 30 U.S.C. 901, <T3>et seq.</T3> This inapplicability provision recognizes that certainclaimants, often <T3>pro se,</T3> should not be bound by strict rules of evidence when presentingclaims for entitlement to benefits. Comments are also invited as to whetherRules of Evidence should be applied at all to administrative proceedingsunder the Administrative Procedure Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Matters</ITAG>Because this rule is procedural in nature, it is not a major rule as definedby Executive Order 12291. The rule will not have a significant effect ona substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. andSection; 601, et seq. The rule as proposed containsno information collection or recordkeeping requirements as defined by thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 18</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Labor.Accordingly, Part 18 of Subtitle A of the Code of Federal Regulations isproposed to be amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 11th day of January 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ann McLaughlin,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of Labor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">PART 18_RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGSBEFORE THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES</ITAG>1.

The more probably true than not true testis the most liberal harmless error standard. See <T3>Haddad </T3>v. <T3>Lockheed California Corp., </T3>720 F.2d 1454, 1458-59 (9th Cir. 1983):</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of a harmless error standard is to enable an appellatecourt to gauge the probability that the trier of fact was affected by theerror. See R. Traynor, [The Riddle of Harmless Error] at 29-30. Perhapsthe most important factor to consider in fashioning such a standard isthe nature of the particular fact-finding process to which the standardis to be applied. Accordingly, a crucial first step in determining howwe should gauge the probability that an error was harmless is recognizingthe distinction between civil and criminal trials. See <T3>Kotteakos </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> 328 U.S. 750, 763, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1247, 90 L.Ed.1557 (1946); <T3>Valle-Valdez,</T3> 544 F.2d at 914-15. This distinction has two facets,each of which reflects the differing burdens of proof in civil and criminalcases. First, the lower burden of proof in civil cases implies a largermargin of error. The danger of the harmless error doctrine is that an appellatecourt may usurp the jury's function, by merely deleting improper evidencefrom the record and assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to supportthe verdict below. See <T3>Kotteakos,</T3> 328 U.S. at 764-65, 66 S. Ct. at 1247-48; R. Traynor,supra, at 18-22. This danger has less practical importance where, as inmost civil cases, the jury verdict merely rests on a more probable thannot standard of proof.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The second facet of the distinction between errors in civil and criminaltrials involves the differing degrees of certainty owed to civil and criminallitigants.

The reason we require a determination on the record is thatwe think fair procedure in resolving disputes of adjudicative facts callsfor giving each party a chance to meet in the appropriate fashion the factsthat come to the tribunal's attention, and the appropriate fashion formeeting disputed adjudicative facts includes rebuttal evidence, cross-examination,usually confrontation, and argument (either written or oral or both).

Nor do they reveal a difference with respectto so-called `jury notice.' Their difference relates to judicial noticeof `facts.' Here Wigmore, following Thayer, insists that judicial noticeis solely to save time where dispute is unlikely and that a matter judiciallynoticed is therefore only `prima facie,' or rebuttable, if the opponentelects to dispute it. It is express in Thayer and implicit in Wigmore that(perhaps because the matter is rebuttable) judicial notice may be appliednot only to indisputable matters but also to matters of lesser certainty.Morgan on the other hand defines judicial notice more narrowly, and hisconsequences follow from his definition. He limits judicial notice of factto matters patently indisputable. And his position is that matters judiciallynoticed are not rebuttable. He asserts that it is wasteful to permit patentlyindisputable matters to be litigated by way of formal proof and furthermorethat it would be absurd to permit a party to woo a jury to an obviouslyerroneous finding contrary to the noticed fact. Also, he objects to theWigmorean conception on the ground that it is really a `presumption' ofsorts attempting to pass under a misleading name. It is, according to Morgan,a presumption with no recognized rules as to how the presumption works,what activates it, and who has the burden of doing how much to rebut it.'').</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, notice that items (ii) and (iv) of the Uniform Law CommissionersModel State Administrative Procedure Act quoted above are not includedas separate items in Rule 201.

Since all effectiveevidence is prejudicial in the sense of being damaging to the party againstwhom it is offered, prejudice which calls for exclusion is given a morespecialized meaning: an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improperbasis, commonly but not necessarily an emotional one, such as bias, sympathy,hatred, contempt, retribution or horror. Unfair prejudice is not, however,a proper ground for the exclusion of relevant evidence under these rules.Judges have shown over the years the ability to resist deciding matterson such an improper basis. Accord <T3>Gulf States Utilities Co. </T3>v. <T3>Ecodyne Corp., </T3>635 F.2d 517, 519 (5th Cir.1981) (``The exclusionof the evidence under Rule 403's weighing of probative value against prejudicewas improper. This portion of andSection;18.403 has no logical applicationto bench trials. Excluding relevant evidence in a bench trial because itis cumulative or a waste of time is clearly a proper exercise of the judge'spower, but excluding relevant evidence on the basis of `unfair prejudice'is a useless procedure. Section 18.403 assumes a trial judge is able todiscern and weigh the improper inferences that a jury might draw from certainevidence, and then balance those improprieties against probative valueand necessity. Certainly, in a bench trial, the same judge can also excludethose improper inferences from his mind in reaching a decision.'').  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While andSection;18.403, like Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence,does speak in terms of both confusion of the issues and misleading of thetrier of fact, the distinction between such terms is unclear in the literatureand in the cases. McCormick, Evidence section 185 at 546 (3d ed. 1984),refers to the probability that certain proof and the answering evidencethat it provokes might unduly distract the trier of fact from the mainissues. 2 Wigmore, Evidence section 443 at 528-29 (Chadbourn rev. 1979),describes the concept as follows:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[I]n attempting to dispute or explain away the evidence thus offered,new issues will arise as to the occurrence of the instances and the similarityof conditions, new witnesses will be needed whose cross-examination andimpeachment may lead to further issues; and that thus the trial will beunduly prolonged, and the multiplicity of minor issues will be such thatthe jury will lose sight of the main issue, and the whole evidence willbe only a mass of confused data from which it will be difficult to extractthe kernel of controversy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Both commentators are clearly describing the notion of confusion ofthe issues. While of course a trier of fact confused in the foregoing mannercan also be said to have been misled, it is suggested that the conceptof misleading refers primarily to the possibility of the trier of factovervaluing the probative value of a particular item of evidence for anyreason other than the emotional reaction associated with unfair prejudice.To illustrate, evidence of the results of a lie detector, even where anattempt is made to explain fully the significance of the results, is likelyto be overvalued by the trier of fact. Similarly, the test of </ITAG><T3>Frye </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>293 F.1013, 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1923), imposing therequirement with respect to the admissibility of scientific evidence thatthe particular technique be shown to have gained ``general acceptance inthe particular field in which it belongs,'' is an attempt to prevent decisionmakers from being unduly swayed by unreliable scientific evidence. Demonstrativeevidence in the form of a photograph, map, model, drawing or chart whichvaries substantially from the fact of consequence sought to be illustratedsimilarly may mislead. Finally, any trier of fact may be misled by thesheer amount of time spent upon a question into believing the issue tobe of major importance and accordingly into attaching too much significanceto it in its determination of the factual issues involved.   <ITAG tagnum="21">Occasionally evidence is excluded not because distracting side issueswill be created but rather because an unsuitable amount of time would beconsumed in clarifying the situation. Concerns associated with the properuse of trial time also arise where the evidence being offered is relevantto a fact as to which substantial other evidence has already been introduced,including evidence bearing on the question of credibility, where the evidenceitself possesses only minimal probative value, such as evidence admittedas background, or where evidence is thought by the court to be collateral.In recognition of the legitimate concern of the court with expendituresof time, andSection;18.403 provides for exclusion of evidence where its incrementalprobative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of unduedelay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.Roughly speaking, undue delay can be argued to refer to delay caused bythe failure of the party to be able to produce the given evidence at theappropriate time at trial but only at some later time. Waste of time maybe taken to refer to the fact that the evidence possesses inadequate incrementalprobative value in light of the time its total exploration will consume.Cumulative refers to multiple sources of different evidence establishingthe same fact of consequence as well as multiple same sources, such asten witnesses all testifying to the same speed of the car or the same characterof a witness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Reporter's Note to andSection;18.501.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference Report to Rule 501, 1975 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad.News 7098, 7100 states:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Rule 501 deals with the privilege of a witness not to testify.

The administrative law judge may entertain the objections of anyparty to the evidence submitted under this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Section 18.1101(c) provides that these rules do not apply to the extentinconsistent with, in conflict with, or to the extent a matter is otherwiseprovided for by a rule or regulation of specific application prescribedby the United States Department of Labor pursuant to statutory authority.Whether section 23(a) and andSection; 725.455(b) are fact incompatible withthese rules is a very difficult question.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Without regard to section 23(a) and andSection; 725.444(b), variousother considerations support the conclusion to exclude hearings under Longshore,Black Lung, and related acts from coverage of these rules at this time.Longshore, Black Lung, and related acts involve entitlements. Claimantsin such hearings benefit from proceeding pursuant to the most liberal evidencerules that are consistent with the orderly administration of justice andthe ascertainment of truth. Claimants in such hearings on occasion appearpro se. While the modifications made by these rules are clearly designedto further liberalize the already liberal Federal Rules of Evidence, itis nevertheless unclear at this time whether even conformity with minimalrequirements with respect to the introduction of evidence would presenta significant barrier to the successful prosecution of meritorious claims.Rather than speculate as to the impact adoption of these rules would haveupon such entitlement programs, it was decided to exclude hearings involvingsuch entitlement programs from coverage of these rules. It is anticipatedthat application of these rules to hearings involving such entitlementprograms will be reconsidered in the future following careful study.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-1039 Filed 1-18-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-20-M </ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
