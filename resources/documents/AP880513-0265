The loss, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, would beamong the largest quarterly shortfalls ever for a thrift, andleaves Sunbelt with negative regulatory capital, a lenient measureof net worth, of almost $1.7 billion, the Wall Street Journalreported in Friday editions.   The cost of closing Sunbelt could rival last November's record$1.3 billion bailout of Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association, anotherTexas thrift. Regulators have speculated that Sunbelt, however,could be merged with other troubled Texas thrifts and recapitalizedwith a combination of private capital and federal assistance.   The ``Southwest Plan,'' a blueprint developed by federalregulators for rebuilding Texas' ailing thrift industry, wasexpected to be announced this week. The strategy calls forcombining healthy institutions with about 140 ailing Texas thrifts,including 104 declared insolvent.   On Wednesday, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that thethrifts had capital losses of $3.3 billion in the quarter endedMarch 31, including the $2.4 billion loss in March. Regulators saidone Texas thrift caused much of the hit to capital, but theyrefused to identify the thrift.   Thomas J. Wageman, Sunbelt's chairman and chief executiveofficer, told the Wall Street Journal the thrift is closely heldand does not report its numbers publicly.   Wageman's secretary told The Associated Press he was notavailable for further comment. FHLB-Dallas officials did notimmediately return the AP's calls.   Wageman told the Journal new accounting rules imposed by federalregulators have hurt all savings and loans because the thrifts areless flexible in deferring possible losses on foreclosed property.   ``From the point of view of balance sheets, it's a revolution inthe industry,'' he said.   Experts, though, said the new accounting rules don't fullyexplain Sunbelt's loss, and cited declining Texas real estatevalues as a factor.   For the nine months ended Dec. 31, Sunbelt had a net loss of$406.2 million, giving the thrift an indicated loss for the year ofabout $1.6 billion. Sunbelt had $3.3 billion in assets as of Dec.31.   Wageman, a former banker who came to Sunbelt in 1986, has been acritic of Texas savings and loan lending practices. He wasinstalled at Sunbelt after H. Joe Selby, a former federal bankregulator who had worked with him, took over thrift supervision atthe Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas.   Sunbelt, meanwhile, lost a $62.9 million-plus suit filed by oneof the thrift's borrowers after Sunbelt foreclosed on theborrower's real estate loans, Dallas County court records show.   A Dallas jury decided the case Tuesday against Sunbelt, but thecourt has not issued a formal judgment and neither the developers,the lenders, nor either side's attorneys would comment about thecase.   The amount of damages will be decided by a state district judgeafter a hearing.   T.F. Stone-Liberty Land Associates, the former owners of theLiberty Plaza II office buildings and 42 acres of land in northDallas, said in their lawsuit that Sunbelt wrongfully foreclosedthe properties in August 1987.   The partnership, led by Tommy F. Stone, said in its suit thatSunbelt used its financial leverage to force the partnership intounwanted deals, then foreclosed to acquire the property.   The suit asked for the return of the foreclosed building andland, cancellation of the loans, and up to $62.9 million in damages.</TEXT></DOC>
