But challengers to parental notification laws in Ohio andMinnesota countered that the measures unfairly impinged on a girl'sright to abortion, as guaranteed by the Supreme Court in its 1973Roe vs. Wade decision.   Groups on both sides of the abortion issue looked to the courtthis term to clarify where it stood on Roe vs. Wade. But anIllinois case that promised to be the major barometer of thecourt's intent was settled out of court last week.   The cases argued before the court today dealt, not with thebroad issue of whether abortion should be legal, but whetherparents of minors should be notified if their daughters seek one.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, considered a key vote in bothnotification cases, expressed skepticism about the Minnesota law'srequirement that both biological parents of a girl be notifiedbefore an abortion is performed.   ``The statute just doesn't provide for any exceptions, even whenit's not in the child's best interest,'' she told Minnesota ChiefDeputy Attorney General John Tunheim. ``How do you defend thestate's best interest?''   Tunheim said biological parents are presumed to have ``rightsand responsibilities'' in the upbringing of their children that thestate should defend.   But Janet Benshoof, representing challengers to the Minnesotalaw, said the state gave minor girls inadequate protection againstunfit parents.   She said the law requires notification of a parent who may be``a mental patient, a fugitive, who beats the family regularly.''   In some cases, there are fathers who have been been absent fromthe family for years and the daughter seeking an abortion wouldhave to notify him even if he were ``a complete stranger,'' Ms.Benshoof said.   The Ohio law requires notification of one parent.   ``States are entitled to enact laws to aid parents,'' OhioAssistant Attorney General Rita Eppler argued.   Ms. Eppler urged the justices to reinstate a law she saidpreserves a minor's right to abortion while aiding parentalinvolvement.   But Linda Sogg, a Cleveland lawyer representing those whosuccessfully challenged the Ohio law in lower courts, contended,``Ohio really has singled out ... abortion ... for the notificationrequirement.''   She said young girls seeking medical help for drug abuse or acontagious disease face no such parental-notification requirement.   At issue in both cases are state laws requiring doctors tonotify parents before performin abortions sought by unmarried girlsunder 18 who are still supported by a parent.   The lawyers in both cases were asked numerous questions by thejustices during a two-hour-long presentation.   As an alternative to parental notification, the Ohio law allowsa young girl to try to persuade a judge that she is mature enoughto make the decision on her own, or that telling her parents is notin her best interests.   The Ohio law says a young girl must prove her maturity by``clear and convincing evidence.''   O'Connor asked whether that standard makes it too difficult foryoung girls seeking a judge's approval to get an abortion withoutparental notification.   ``What about the risk of erroneous deprivation'' of a minor'sright to abortion, O'Connor asked Ms. Eppler.   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that both Ohio andMinnesota contend that no so-called judicial bypass alternative toparental notificiation is required.   The Ohio law ``represents no undue burden,'' Ms. Eppler said,adding that the state has a pressing interest in assuring theinvolvement of parents ``when their daughter faces perhaps the mostserious dilemma of her young life.''   But Ms. Sogg argued, ``not all parents are loving,'' andreferred to ``too many statistics about how unloving parents canbe.''   She told the court many young girls who desire abortions have a``fear of parental retaliation or abuse.''   About half the states have laws requiring parental consent, butmost of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges.   Nationwide, about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teen-agerswho become pregnant each year seek abortions. Of the 1.5 millionlegal abortions performed annually since 1973, about 12 percent _180,000 each year _ have been for minors.   The court touched off a political firestorm in July by voting5-4 to give states greater power to regulate abortions. Fourjustices appeared ready to go even further and overturn Roe vs.Wade. O'Connor refused.   But she has been critical of the 1973 ruling and has notdiscounted the chance she someday would vote to reverse it.   Neither Ohio nor Minnesota is asking the court to reverse Roevs. Wade, but the Bush administration has.   Although it did not seek to participate in today's arguments,the Bush administration urged the court to use the Minnesota caseto rule that women have no constitutional right to abortion.   ``We continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and shouldbe overruled,'' Justice Department lawyers said in afriend-of-the-court brief.   The disputed Ohio law was passed by the state legislature in1985 but never took effect, due to a successful legal challenge byan Akron abortion clinic and one of its doctors, Max Pierre Gaujean.   The law would have required any doctor asked to perform anabortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl'sparents at least 24 hours before the operation.   A young girl could seek to bypass parental notification byseeking a state judge's permission to have the abortion.   A federal judge struck down the law, and that ruling was upheldby the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The Minnesota law requires such young girls to notify bothbiological parents at least 48 hours before obtaining an abortion.The 1981 law makes doctors criminally liable for violations.   After enforcement of the law was blocked, a judicial-bypassprovision took effect. It allows a girl to avoid notifying herparents by convincing a judge she is ``mature and capable of givinginformed consent'' or that not notifying her parents would be inher best interests.   The notification law with the judicial-bypass option was ineffect in Minnesota for five years before it was struck down by afederal judge.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling lastyear and said the law is constitutional. The appeals court,however, blocked enforcement of the law pending Supreme Courtaction.   The cases are Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,88-805, and Hodgson vs. Minnesota, 88-1125 and 88-1309.</TEXT></DOC>
