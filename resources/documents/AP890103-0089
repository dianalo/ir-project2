(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Family members who serve as judge,prosecutor and defense attorney in Dyer County Juvenile Court saythey work hard at avoiding conflicts of interest.   ``It looks like a kangaroo court,'' said James O. Lanier, thepublic defender.   His brother, David W. Lanier, is the juvenile court judge. Thepublic defender's son, James E. Lanier, is a prosecutor.   Judge Lanier requires all attorneys, defendants and parents tosign a waiver before he hears a case in which his brother or nepheware attorneys. The waiver acknowledges that everyone is aware of therelationships.   So far, no one has refused to sign.   But the judge, who has been on the bench in this westernTennessee community since 1982, said he does not believe his nephewshould prosecute cases in his courtroom.   ``I don't think there will be any conflict of interest, but it'snot good practice for the three of us to all be in the courtroom,''he said.   But James E. Lanier said he sees no conflict. ``None of us are incollusion with each other,'' he said.   State Attorney General Charles W. Burson has issued a legalopinion requested by James O. Lanier saying the arrangement violatesno state law.   Gil Campbell, executive director of the Tennessee BarAssociation, declined to comment.   Other Tennessee officials said it is common for parties in legalproceedings to be related, but not to the extent of the Laniers.   James O. Lanier, the public defender, also has asked the stateBoard of Professional Responsibility for an ethics opinion on thematter. The board is made up of nine private attorneys appointed bythe state Supreme Court to supervise the legal profession.   James O. Lanier and his son practiced law together for sevenyears before the younger Lanier became assistant district attorneygeneral in October.</TEXT></DOC>
