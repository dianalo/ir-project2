Moore (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FBC </CO><IN> SCR ERN </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Financiere Credit Suisse First Boston, holding company for the powerful Eurobond house, said consolidated profit fell 19% last year, reversing seven consecutive years of record profits.    CSFB blamed the decline in both profit and revenue on dwindling new-issue volume in the $650 billion Eurobond market last year. It also reflects intensified competition, especially from Japanese firms such as Nomura Securities Co. Nomura dislodged CSFB last year as the leading Eurobond underwriter for the first time in a decade.    In an interview, John M. Hennessy, CSFB president and chief executive officer predicted flat profit this year as international capital markets remain difficult and volatile. And while CSFB managed to &quot;escape the bloodletting&quot; of mass layoffs shaking up many international securities firms here, Mr. Hennessy said CSFB's present London staff of 850 employees probably would be cut 10% through attrition during 1988.    The Zug, Switzerland-based holding company reported consolidated profit slipped to 182.8 million Swiss francs ($132 million) in 1987 from 225.8 million francs the previous year. Revenue dropped 6.7% to 471.9 million francs from 503.8 million francs. Mr. Hennessy said currency factors accounted for much of the profit decline. Measured in dollars, 1987 profit was unchanged from 1986, he said.    CSFB's income from trading operations plunged 44.6% to 105.2 million francs last year from 190 million francs in 1986. Mr. Hennessy said the drop mainly occurred in fixed-rate Eurodollar bonds and floating-rate Eurobonds. Secondary trading volume plummeted last year in both sectors.    CSFB is a financial hybrid owned 60% by Zurich, Switzerland-based Credit Suisse and 40% by First Boston Inc., a New York-based investment bank. Under the complex web of cross-ownership, Financiere Credit Suisse First Boston holds a 40% stake in First Boston.    The holding company said its investment income was almost halved in 1987, to 64.5 million francs from 117.5 million francs the previous year. Mr. Hennessy said most of the decline reflected the decline of the dollar in valuing CSFB's stake in First Boston at prevailing exchange rates last Dec. 31.    By contrast, its investment-banking income surged to 243.3 million francs from 151.4 million francs a year earlier. CSFB credited a sharp rise in international mergers and acquisitions. CSFB said it advised in 65 transactions valued at $23 billion during 1987, 36% higher than in 1986. CSFB has worked closely with First Boston on mergers and acquisitions, but that cooperation now is clouded because two of First Boston's best-known specialists in the field recently left the U.S. firm.    Mr. Hennessy also acknowledged that CSFB may have trouble matching last year's profit during 1988. One reason: its past reliance on underwriting equity and equity-related securities, which he estimated accounted for more than 80% of the firm's 1987 profit. Since last October's stock market crash, new issues of such products have practically ceased.    In recent years, CSFB often dominated the Eurobond market with the success of a single product. But &quot;this isn't a time to count on raising revenues,&quot; Mr. Hennessy said. &quot;We will switch the emphasis to be a low-cost producer, while trying to pick out market niches that may open briefly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
