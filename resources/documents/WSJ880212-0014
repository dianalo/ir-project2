Leonard Peletz, the company's president, said the loss resulted mainly from &quot;losses incurred in connection with the company's introduction of its new spring-summer catalog during the first half of the year. Also, fourth-quarter earnings, which historically have offset losses during the first half, fell below expectations.&quot;    The Golden Valley, Minn.-based retail mail-order concern for hunting, fishing and outdoors gear earned $657,658, or 11 cents a share, on sales of $14.5 million, in 1986.    The company's stock was quoted at 93.75 cents bid, down 6.25 cents, in over-the-counter trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
