He was the high school killer in the black comedy ``Heathers.''Now he's a shy student who uses a pirate radio station to inflamehis fellow high schoolers in ``Pump Up the Volume.''   ``I'm trying to put high school behind me and age a littlebit,'' smiled Slater, whose innocent face could easily pass formidteens. ``I think `Pump Up the Volume' will be my last highschool film.   ``On the set of the movie I was talking in an interview abouthow I would like to grow a little bit and play a character who hada bit of scruffiness to him, a little bit older. Then along came`Young Guns 2,' which was perfect.''   In ``Pump Up the Volume,'' Slater is a newcomer to an Arizonaschool, a total outsider who nevertheless communicates with hisfrenetic, X-rated rantings and heavy-metal music on his makeshiftradio station. The New Line Cinema film is obviously aimed at theyoung crowd, but the star has some impressive, high-pitch scenesbefore the microphone.   He can even find a message in the movie: ``It deals with freedomof speech, expressing yourself, saying what you really feel insituations, and of just being the best you can be and not beingafraid.''   On ``Young Guns 2,'' Slater was the new kid in the block thatincluded Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillipsfrom the first movie.   ``There was no feeling of being tested or anything,'' saidSlater. ``I felt immediately accepted into that group. They werevery supportive.   ``I was the new rider, and I had a lot of catching up to do,working with the guns. Kiefer was fast on the draw; we had a lot ofraces. Luckily, we weren't given real bullets. Lou was an excellentrider, and he was teaching me different mounts and feelingcomfortable in the saddle again.   ``Riding is a difficult thing. If you have a moment of lapse ofconcentration, the horse can spook, anything can happen, which iswhat I think happened to Lou.'' Late in filming, Diamond almoststrangled on a rope when his horse ran away; the actor managed toescape with only a broken arm.   Slater has been acting almost from birth. The son of stage andTV actor Michael Hawkins and Mary Jo Slater, now a casting agent,he was three months old when his mother brought him onstage in aplay. According to family legend, she held him aloft and declared,``This is your life, my son.''   The boy was 9 when he was chosen to appear with Dick Van Dyke ina revival of ``The Music Man.'' He followed with ``Macbeth'' (NicolWilliamson), ``David Copperfield,'' ``Merlin,'' ``Sherlock Holmes''(Frank Langella), plus a number of TV specials.   Slater's big break came at 16: as Sean Connery's youthfulsidekick in ``The Name of the Rose.''   ``My first film was `The Legend of Billie Jean,' '' he recalled.``Then to do `The Name of the Rose' and play a 14th-century monkjust didn't seem like it made any sense to me. I didn't think therewas a prayer of making the transition.   ``But it turned out to be the greatest experience I've ever had.I was in awe of Mr. Connery, and he lived up to every expectation Ihad of James Bond. I loved him, he was great.''   The script called for the young man to be seduced by a lustywench. He has a brief, interrupted love scene with co-star EllenGreene in ``Pump Up the Volume.'' Otherwise, Slater tries to avoidgraphic sex.   ``I'm sometimes in the situation where a director will ask toexpose a little more than I feel is necessary,'' he said. ``I justsay, `I don't feel I ever need to do it again, unless I truly feelit is necessary.' I felt it was necessary in `The Name of theRose,' and it was done beautifully. I truly feel it is behind me.Literally.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMThurs Aug. 23</NOTE></DOC>
