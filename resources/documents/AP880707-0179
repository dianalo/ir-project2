On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Augustdelivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 centshigher at $15.36 per barrel Wednesay after picking up 15 cents onTuesday.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasolineclosed up 0.84 cent to 50.56 cents a gallon and home heating oiladvanced 1.02 cents to 42.61 cents a gallon.   Most traders gave little weight to a Kuwait News Agency reportthat three members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries might request an emergency meeting of the cartel, saidMadison Galbraith, senior energy specialist for Merrill LynchEnergy Futures.   The Kuwaiti news agency, citing high-level senior industrysources, said officials from Venezuela, Algeria and Ecuador wantedOPEC to consider ways of cutting production and propping up prices.   Some traders were concerned about the report and the possibilityof higher prices, but Wednesday's gains were the result of ``justanother short-covering rally,'' Galbraith said.   In a short trade, an investor sells borrowed contracts in hopeof replacing them later with contracts bought at lower prices. Insuch cases, a price rise can cause a flurry of buying as traderstry to cover their positions.   Galbraith called the advance a correction of an oversold market,and said the underlying market fundamentals remained bearish.   At its meeting last month, OPEC oil ministers failed to settletheir internal problems and simply left the existing system ofproduction quotas and prices unchanged.   But that system was, and still is, in disarray. Most OPECmembers are producing above their individual quotas or discountingtheir prices.   Some estimates put OPEC production at 3.5 million barrels abovethe group's self-imposed overall ceiling of 15.06 million barrels aday.</TEXT></DOC>
