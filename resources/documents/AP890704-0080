I feel verypatriotic.''   Badger led the group of about 50 young Americans in a lustyrendition of the folk song ``This Land Is Your Land.'' Others whogathered along the shaded Poton River read the Declaration ofIndependence, drank Japanese beer, ate crackers and watermelon, andplayed volleyball against some youths from Portugal.   The Americans are in the isolated and rigidly communist nationfor the World Festival of Youth and Students, a political conclaveof 15,000 mostly leftist young people from 180 countries.   The American group, about 90 in all, is making a rare visit to acountry that has no diplomatic relations with Washington andconstantly vilifies the United States for its role in the 1950-53Korean War and its military presence in rival South Korea.   ``You have to come to grips with the fact that this country wasleveled by U.S. bombs,'' said Christine Kelly, a leader of theStudent Action Union at Rutgers University.   She said she carried the American flag into the stadium duringopening ceremonies Saturday, adding: ``I want to be proud of theUnited States.''   But she said she wept when she met a delegate from Nicaragua``who had been crippled by American bullets'' in the war against theU.S.-backed Contra resistance forces. ``It is painful.''   Jim Cullen, from the Student Association of the State Universityof New York in Albany, said the Fourth of July was ``an idea of whatwe can be.'' The celebration, ``no matter how small or modest, is avision of a better America,'' he said.   Michele Goodwin, student government leader at the University ofWisconsin, disagreed, saying Independence Day was a time when blacks``get to look at how double-handed and hypocritical'' Americansociety is.   Miss Goodwin, who is black, said, ``America will never haveindependence'' until hunger, poverty and sexism are eliminated.   She said she had come to the party ``to analyze all of this.''   Others said their discussions with Soviet, Cuban and Third Worldyouths, and their exposure to the highly disciplined North Koreansociety, which is so diffferent from their own, had given them newperspectives on the United States.   ``A lot of us are thinking more of our own country and what itstands for,'' said Lisa Bratton of the Southern Christian LeadershipConference in Atlanta.   Victor Buines, 25, an immigrant from Honduras living in New York,said he was determined to work for change from within the UnitedStates.   Buines, a representative from the National Catholic StudentCoalition who is waiting to receive his U.S. citizenship, said hewent to Fourth of July picnic to ``welcome my new country I'madopting as my fatherland.''</TEXT></DOC>
