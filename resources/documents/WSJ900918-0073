After 18 hours of testimony, it appeared that Judge Souteris practically certain to be confirmed. The hearings arescheduled to continue today, with witnesses testifying forand against Judge Souter, who celebrated his 51st birthdayyesterday. But even as Senate aides were distributing listsof scheduled witnesses yesterday afternoon, some liberalgroups, such as People for the American Way, were decidingthey wouldn't oppose the nomination.</LP><TEXT>   Some of the toughest questioning yesterday came fromconservative Republicans who seemed concerned that some ofJudge Souter's statements last week invited too broad a rolefor the Supreme Court.   Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said he was &quot;a littletroubled&quot; by Judge Souter's suggestion that the courts mustsometimes fill the &quot;vacuum&quot; created by the failure ofCongress or the president to take action.   But Judge Souter said he was referring to courtsexercising their existing authority, not expanding theirjurisdiction to fill vacuums. He said that in 1954, theSupreme Court ordered school desegregation after Congress andthe states declined to do it. But he said the court actedunder its authority to implement the 14th Amendment guaranteeof &quot;equal protection of the laws,&quot; not under some usurpedpower.   He repeatedly declined senators' invitations to criticizea Supreme Court ruling last spring upholding the authority offederal judges to order local officials to raise taxes tofund school desegregation plans. He suggested that perhapsthe Supreme Court shouldn't have heard the case, whichinvolved school desegregation in Kansas City, Mo., but hewouldn't find fault with the 5-4 ruling.   Judge Souter said he doesn't agree with the view ofretired Justice William Brennan, whom he was nominated tosucceed, that the death penalty in all circumstances isunconstitutional. He said the authors of the Bill of Rightsenvisioned the existence of capital punishment.   Reiterating his pledge to approach the right to abortionwith an open mind, he generally refused to discuss the 1973Roe vs. Wade decision that recognized the right to abortion,as well as varied questions about how to define legally whenhuman life begins. In the only specific response he gave onthe abortion issue, he said that if the 1973 decision wereoverruled by the Supreme Court, state legislatures would passa variety of different abortion laws.   In other aspects of his testimony, the former NewHampshire Supreme Court justice, who is currently a federalappeals court judge, said that based on his five years as astate trial judge, he has &quot;enormous respect&quot; for the jurysystem in criminal cases and civil damages cases.   Although he didn't elaborate, his answer might mean thathe is skeptical of arguments that juries are approvingexcessively large punitive-damage awards. Theconstitutionality of punitive-damage awards is an issue to bedecided by the Supreme Court in its term that begins Oct. 1.It is unclear, however, whether Judge Souter will beconfirmed by the Senate in time to vote in the case, whichwill be argued Oct. 3.   Judge Souter said he doesn't &quot;set myself up as an expertin antitrust matters.&quot; But he said he doesn't believeantitrust enforcement should be eliminated for verticalprice-fixing cases in which manufacturers dictate retailprices.</TEXT></DOC>
