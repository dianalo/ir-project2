Rundle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   As toy guns continue to get more realistic-looking, real guns are starting to look even more like toys. And that has security experts, airline personnel and child-welfare activists worried.    The problem, they say, is that the new, small, lightweight handguns are hard to spot with metal and X-ray detection devices. Moreover, their resemblance to toys may make the deadly weapons appear safe to both security guards and children. And soon, real guns made of plastic could compound the problem.    &quot;Real guns made almost entirely of plastic may soon enter the marketplace, making the differentiation of real guns from toy guns immensely more difficult,&quot; warns Garen J. Wintemute, an assistant professor in the department of family practice in the School of Medicine at the University of California at Davis. &quot;From a preventive-medicine standpoint, we have a unique opportunity here,&quot; he says.    The opportunity, he says, is a bill pending in Congress that would ban future production of plastic or other handguns that flunk certain X-ray and magnetometer tests. Three handguns currently sold would be affected, says Mary Louise Westmoreland, a Senate judiciary subcommittee staff counsel. The three aren't being identified for security reasons, she adds.    But gun-control critics maintain that the legislation is merely another attack on handguns. Undetectable guns don't exist, they assert. &quot;Turn up the sensitivity (of detection equipment) and make the line a little longer,&quot; suggests Jim Baker, the National Rifle Association's director of governmental affairs. &quot;I don't think airline passengers would mind a little bit of inconvenience to be secure.&quot;    The Federal Aviation Administration says publicly that its existing systems are powerful enough to detect the smallest, lightest handguns made. But airline pilots and executives, who support the plastic-gun ban, aren't convinced. They believe that FAA tests, conducted under laboratory conditions, aren't reliable.    &quot;The real world is a security agent who has been sitting for six hours at a machine and has 200 people waiting to get through the line so they don't miss a connection,&quot; says a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association.    There's general agreement that eventual manufacture and sale of plastic guns is likely; some law-enforcement experts believe that the Soviets already have made an all-plastic disposable gun, called a Troika. &quot;If the technology exists to put a man on the moon, it's only common sense that somebody can figure out how to make a plastic weapon,&quot; says Jerald R. Vaughn, executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.    Certain plastic composites &quot;offer the advantages of strength, light weight, corrosion resistance and ease of manufacturing, all of which make them an attractive material for handguns,&quot; says a 1986 report prepared by Congress's Office of Technology Assessment.    There's enormous interest in plastic guns among dealers. &quot;We don't need plastic guns from a performance point. We need them from a marketing and sales point,&quot; said a 1986 editorial in the official magazine of the National Association of Federally Licensed Firearms Dealers. &quot;The only thing that's ever going to do anything for new gun sales in the future is to make the 150 million old guns obsolete, and that's exactly the promise that the plastic gun holds forth.&quot;    Dr. Wintemute, an expert on unintentional shootings among children, worries plastic handguns would increase the incidence of such tragedies. In a commentary in the current issue of Pediatrics, he warns plastic handguns could &quot;conceivably be marketed as personal accessories.&quot; If they were made by injection molding, the process used for many toys, they could be made in many colors, he adds.    The proposal to ban hard-to-detect guns has created some surprising alliances because of fears that such weapons might be used by terrorists. For example, Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a longtime opponent of gun control, is co-sponsoring the Senate measure with Howard Metzenbaum, a Democrat from Ohio. Says Sen. Thurmond's press secretary: &quot;He's broken ranks with the NRA&quot; because &quot;we've got to keep people from smuggling guns onto airplanes.&quot;    In early December, the Senate proposal fell short of passage by only five votes. Gun-control advocates are nonetheless optimistic that the measure will muster enough support to pass both houses before Congress adjourns next fall. But, after the close vote in December, gun owners who oppose any firearms' restrictions are redoubling their efforts. Last month, the NRA sent out a letter to its three million members warning that Congress has launched a &quot;sneak attack&quot; on their constitutional right to bear arms. </TEXT></DOC>
