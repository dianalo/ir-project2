The raid _ and Arafat's refusal to condemn it _ led to thisweek's suspension of U.S. dialogue with the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   Abbas, better known as Abu Abbas, said in a statementdistributed to international news agencies in Baghdad that he hadgiven Arafat a complete file on the attack plans to show it wasaimed at military targets.   The Tel Aviv shore was crowded with holiday beachgoers at thetime of the May 30 seaborne attack by 16 guerrillas of Abbas'Palestine Liberation Front. Israeli forces foiled the raid, andthere were no Israeli casualties.   Abbas said he had agreed that Arafat could ``take any measure hesees as necessary to protect the national achievements of ourpeople.''   He accused the Bush adminstration of using the raid as a pretextto cut off the 18-month dialogue Wednesday with the PLO and``humiliate'' the organization and its leaders.   Abbas, who masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the cruise shipAchille Lauro in which a disabled American was killed, said hisgroup would continue its armed struggle against Israel.   ``I hereby declare that we are insisting on confronting theZionist enemy and fighting for the freedom of our people,'' hesaid. ``Nothing will stop us but martyrdom or freedom.''   Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia urged the Bush administration toreconsider its decision.   ``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses its deep regret at thesuspension of the dialogue and appeals to the government of theUnited States of America to revise its declared decision in thisconnection and continue its efforts for negotiation and dialoguefor settlement of conflicts,'' said a statement carried by theofficial Saudi Press Agency.   Egypt and Jordan have made similar appeals.</TEXT></DOC>
