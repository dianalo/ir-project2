A special computer network reserved for major cases andsophisticated laboratory tests, including procedures for DNAidentification, were demonstrated Wednesday during a meeting ofauthorities from Atlanta, Savannah, Birmingham, Ala. andJacksonville, Fla., said FBI spokesman Diader Rosario.   It was the first meeting involving federal, state and local lawenforcement representatives from all four cities in which mailbombs were received during a series of attacks in December thatkilled a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer.   Those attending the meeting also were briefed on evidence gainedfrom a public hotline set up to receive tips in the case, Rosariosaid.   Rosario said today there will be further such meetings, but nodate has been set for the next one. He said the FBI, which iscoordinating the investigation, does not want to have the meetingstoo often.   ``Every time you meet you pull people out of the field, wherethey can do more good,'' he said.   Rosario said the investigation has not narrowed to anyparticular area, and still is in full swing in Georgia, Alabama andFlorida.   Robert Vance, a judge on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals, was killed Dec. 16 when a mail bomb exploded athis home near Birmingham, Ala. Two days later, Savannah AldermanRobert Robinson, an attorney who did work with the NAACP, waskilled by a similar bomb. Authorities intercepted bombs sent to the11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta and an NAACP office inJacksonville before they could explode.   A letter to Atlanta television station WAGA-TV last week claimeda group calling itself Americans for a Competent Federal JudicialSystem was responsible for the bombs and threatened more violence.   The letter writer expressed anger over crimes committed byblacks against whites and also made an apparent reference to aschool desegregation case in DeKalb County.   FBI agents searched DeKalb County schools during the Christmasholidays, looking for clues to the bomber and for bombs, accordingto news reports. The FBI and the school system have refused tocomment on the reports.   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris said at a news conferenceWednesday that he would be willing to post a reward for informationin the case, if police ask him to do so. He said he has received nosuch requests.</TEXT></DOC>
