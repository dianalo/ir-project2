Petersen was the driver.;   First as president and later aschairman, Petersen implemented major changes at a company that still operatedunder the Model T School of Management. An emphasis on quality coupled withemployee involvement and participative management were the cornerstones of thenew Ford. The company's U.S. market share grew from 17 to 22 percent.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Drive  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  EX-FORD CHIEF'S BOOK IS HANDS-ON GUIDE TO FIGHTINGCOMPETITION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Fast Lane  </MEMO><TEXT>     When Petersen retired in early 1990, Fortune magazine called him &quot;the mostsuccessful boss since the original Henry in his prime.&quot;;   In his new book, &quot;ABetter Idea: Redefining the Way Americans Work&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, $24.95),Petersen uses Ford's turnabout as a springboard to explain his theories on howU.S. business can do a better job. Rather than a gossipy, inside-Detroit lookat 40 years at Ford -- Petersen joined the company in 1949 after earning amaster's degree in business administration from Stanford University -- hepresents a hands-on, lessons-learned, step-by-step guide to remaking abusiness.;   Petersen said he will never tell &quot;all the obvious titillating andjuicy stories that must be there. . . . I just don't have any interest in it.I don't see that it does any good.&quot;;   What may do some good, Petersen saidduring an interview last week in his suite at the Fairmont Hotel, is for theUnited States to get serious about doing something about competition from theJapanese.;   He predicts that the Japanese share of the U.S. auto market willgrow from its present 30 percent or so to as much as 40 percent by decade'send.;   &quot;I certainly hope it's not too late, although we've lost a wholenumber of product segments entirely,&quot; he said, pointing to consumerelectronics, optical equipment such as cameras and machine tools.;   TheJapanese should open their markets to U.S.-built automobiles and do a betterjob of policing themselves as far as exports are concerned, according toPetersen.;   If their market was open, he argued, he would have &quot;succeeded inmy effort to build an American car compatible in all ways with the Japanesemarket.&quot;;   Petersen said he has not seen &quot;any meaningful action&quot; on the partof the Japanese, who seem content to delay making any major changes by drawingU.S. negotiators into specific-item issues that bog down over insignificantdetails. By the time one issue is negotiated, the U.S. government changesleaders and thus its trade representatives, and more precious time has beenlost, he said.;   &quot;I'd go the other way completely,&quot; he said. &quot;Japan, now thesecond largest economy in the world, has the ability either to be a force forcontinuing the health and growth of the world's economies or destabilizingthem. We hope that we can convince them that it's to their advantage to help,to be a stabilizing force and to assume a responsible role.;   &quot;We have to getthem to agree this has to be brought back into balance and then let themdecide how to do it,&quot; he said.;   Petersen -- in his book and in person --will not voice a specific tactic for fighting the Japanese. He stopped shortof endorsing quotas, instead endorsing a non-specific &quot;policy that protectsour national interest.&quot;;   &quot;The first step,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is to get overthinking about whether Japan's behavior is necessarily right or wrong and torecognize that that's the way the world is.&quot;;   The argument that Japansoftened when it decided to build more cars in the United States -- Nissans inTennessee, Toyota Camrys in Kentucky, Honda Accords in Ohio -- does not washwith Petersen.;   &quot;They are extremely good at the PR side of that,&quot; he said.&quot;In fact, it's extremely rare that important components of a product getsourced to an American company. Their whole claim is that they can't find thequality. Now that gets back to this need for all American enterprises to makequality that No. 1 goal and just put the lie to that kind of a claim.&quot;;  Petersen, who has homes in Michigan and Rancho Mirage, understands that hismessage falls on deafer ears in California, where more than half of the newcars bought every year are from Asian and European makers.;   That, he hopes,will begin to disintegrate once Californians and other Americans test-drivenew domestic cars and realize that their quality has improved.;   &quot;How do weget the perception to equal the present reality is a big part of thequestion,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Matt Nauman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1H  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  769  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 8, 199100313060,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
