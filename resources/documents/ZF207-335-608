(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OLDEST PROFESSION IN DATA PROCESSINGandM;In the beginning there was tape.andP;  All data resided on tape throughout itslife cycle.andP;  As the number of data sets grew, the number of tapes required tostore the data grew.andP;  The resources required to manage the tapes alsogrew--exponentially.andP;  As a result, tape management soon emerged as the mostmanually intensive effort in the data center, and the one most prone toerror.andM;Almost 40 years later, little has changed.andP;  Tape management continues to be anecessary evil in most data processing environments.andP;  Magnetic tape providesbenefits which make it an attractive media for many tasks, but the overheadassociated with management of the media can negate the low cost of the mediaitself.andM;Use of sophisticated software packages to manage the tape resource inconjunction with more automated hardware options has helped lower the costsof tape storage by eliminating much of the manual intervention required.andM;Nevertheless, the costs associated with managing data sets stored on tapehave forced many installations to re-examine the justification for storingdata sets on tape rather than on direct access storage devices (DASD).andM;This article will focus on both the methodologies and tools available tominimize the cost of tape storage as well as the changing rules fordetermining which data sets should reside on tape, as opposed to otherstorage options.andM;EVOLVING ROLE OF TAPEandM;Magnetic tape has always been an attractive storage alternative because ofthe relatively low cost of the magnetic media.andP;  Magnetic tape also has theadvantage of being removable and therefore easily transferred from onelocation to another.andP;  Because the media is removable, a relatively smallnumber of tape drives can service very large tape libraries.andP;  As such, tapehas historically provided a more economic storage alternative to directaccess storage devices.andM;Tape media can also be transported across the data processing center oracross the country with minimal risk of damage to the media--an attractivealternative for duplicate or backup copies of data sets which reside on DASDvolumes.andP;  Every day data centers throughout the country make thousands ofbackup copies to be retained either in-house in a fire resistant vault or,preferably, offsite.andM;As a result, tape is the media which most data centers depend on shoulddisaster strike.andP;  The information required to rebuild the data processingsystem--the operating system, all key business applications, and the datanecessary to drive the applications--resides on backup copies.andM;The increasing dependence of businesses in all industries on data processingdictates that a company's very survival in case of a disaster may bedetermined by the way backup tapes are managed and stored.andM;Data sets no longer required for current applications, but which contain datathat must be maintained for historical or legal purposes, are typicallystored on tape because of both the low cost and portability of the media.andO;Tape in this category may migrate through a number of storage sites bothonsite and offsite as it ages.andM;Tape has also held a unique role in the hierarchy for storage of data setsstill in active use.andP;  Prior to the introduction of DASD, all data was storedon tape and accessed sequentially via batch applications.andM;The introduction of DASD heralded the birth of online data processing.andP;  Butit also created demands on software developers for a whole new class ofapplications.andP;  The cost associated with the development of the newapplications, including the relative high cost per megabyte of DASD storage,had to be justified.andM;MIGRATION EXPLAINEDandM;Although the use of DASD increased, it was still difficult to cost-justify.andO;The costs associated with maintaining the tape library were still more thanoffset by the relatively higher cost of storing data on DASD.andM;For this reason, only those data sets which required very rapid access timeswere stored on DASD.andP;  Data sets which were very frequently accessed or whichmight be needed during the course of critical online applications fell intothis priority response time category.andM;Data sets which were less frequently accessed or which were less critical tothe operation were stored on tape but moved to disk when access was required.andO;The data was then returned to tape when activity associated with the datasubsided.andP;  This technique is called migration.andM;Over the past 10 years, the cost of DASD has dropped significantly, the costof personnel has risen, and the number of online applications has increaseddramatically.andP;  As a result, a far greater proportion of stored data resideson DASD.andM;Although many installations continue to migrate data sets from tape to DASD,a growing number have concluded that tape is more expensive than online DASDstorage for data that continues to be referenced.andP;  In these environments,data is never migrated but remains on DASD until it is permanently retired totape for offsite storage.andM;The usage of tape is therefore limited to storage of data sets for backuppurposes and historical reference.andP;  The only exception may be very largesequential files.andP;  Some of these files may still reside on tape because thereis no performance advantage to be gained by moving them to DASD.andP;  These filesare accessed directly from tape and do not need to be migrated.andM;The community of DASD storage advocates includes Pete Clark, technicalsupport administrator at the Olan Mills data center in Chattanooga, Tenn.andP;  Hestrongly believes that to store as much data as possible on DASD is mostcost-effective.andM;To that end, Olan Mills has even redesigned those applications requiring datastored on sequential tape files to support keyed indexes and random access.andO;The data sets associated with these applications can then be moved to DASD.andO;Clark has found that the benefits have more than justified the expenseinvolved in the redesign effort.andM;&quot;We have eliminated in excess of 5,000 tapes through redesign of applicationsaccessing large sequential files,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The data associated with thesefiles has been moved to DASD where it is far more efficient to maintain.andP;  Inaddition, we have reduced processing time dramatically because we are able toupdate the files randomly.&quot;andM;HIGH COST OF TAPE STORAGEandM;The high cost associated with maintaining a tape library has always been amajor challenge to data processing operations of all sizes.andP;  Tape isattractive because it is removable and a relatively small number of hardwaredevices can support vast tape libraries.andP;  Unfortunately, these twocharacteristics contribute directly to the sizable overhead associated withany tape operation.andM;Removable media must by definition be moved to and from the hardware tapedrive.andP;  The effort involved in this simple transfer of a tape reel orcartridge from its storage location to the desired drive varies with the sizeand proximity of the storage area to the tape drives.andM;Historically, the &quot;tape movers&quot; have been operations personnel who mustmanually retrieve and mount each tape and then return it to the library.andP;  Howmany are involved in this task is a function of the retrieval effort scopeand the number of tape mounts required.andM;Maintaining the physical library is also a major task.andP;  To identify the manyreels within the library, some type of storge scheme is needed that includesexternal labeling of each tape and its associated storage area.andM;Many installations utilize one or more offsite storage areas or vaults forretention of backup files and historical files.andP;  The more offsite locationsthere are, the more manual work is required to transport tapes and track tapemovements to these sites.andM;Even data integrity can be a manual process when tape is used to store data.andO;Removal of a write-protect ring on the tape reel is one means of ensuringthat a tape which was intended for read-only is not inadvertently writtenover.andP;  When the tape is ready to be written over, the ring must be manuallyinserted.andP;  On the new 3480 cartridge technology, a dial on each cartridgemust be manually set to protect the data from being overwritten.andM;Still another st of manual tasks is associated with maintaining the tapemedia itself.andP;  Over time and many uses, the tape media is contaminated bydust and particles.andP;  Ultimately, this contaimination can cause errors inaccessing the data and even result in the loss of critical data.andM;Copying the data of a fresh tape ensures that the data is protected.andO;Contaminated tapes which are cleaned and then certified as viable can bereturned to use.andP;  This set of tasks is referred to as tape maintenance.andM;Not only are these manual procedures costly, they are also prone to errors.andO;The wrong tape can be mounted and data on it can be accidentally destroyed.andO;Job reruns due to incorrect mounts are common.andP;  Tapes that are temporarily&quot;lost&quot; or stored in the wrong slot can create delays in running criticalapplications.andP;  Use of tapes which are in need of cleaning can cause loss ofdata and use of additional CPU overhead to handle resultant error processing.andO;The end result can be significant additional costs to the installation.andM;Software vendors realized long ago that programs designed to reduced themanual overhead and resultant errors in managing a tape library could be ahit in the marketplace.andP;  As a result, many products are available to automatethe process of tape management.andP;  The market response has been overwhelminglypositive.andP;  Tape management software is often the first major systemsmanagement purchase that a data center makes.andP;  When one examines the benefitsto be gained from these tools, it is immediately apparent that their cost isreadily justified by the benefits derived.andM;Today, full-function tape management software can be purchased as a singlepackage for VSE, VM, and MVS environments.andP;  Tower Systems of Costa Mesa,Calif., Systems Center of Reston, Va., and Computer Associates Internationalof Garden City, N.Y., offer packages in one or more of these environments.andO;These packages manage the movement of tape throughout its life cycle, therebyeliminating the need for a dedicated tape librarian in many environments.andM;Full-function tape management packages compare information stored on internallabels to a central catalog of information on all data sets to determine ifthe correct tape has been mounted.andP;  As a result, data stored on tape managedby such a package cannot be accidentally destroyed, and costly reruns frommounting the wrong tape are avoided.andM;The need to pull or replace write rings is also eliminated.andP;  This level ofautomated protection alone is a powerful benefit but only a fraction of thework performed by the software.andP;  Even external labels can be automaticallyprinted by the system if they are needed.andM;Sophisticated tracking of the physcial locations of tapes at any point intime is another powerful benefit of these packages.andP;  Tape management systemsallow tracking of tapes both within the data center and at one or moreexternal storage locations.andP;  Data in the tape catalog allows the site todetermine what tapes need to be shipped offsite for historical storage;centrally stored expiration dates indicate which tapes are ready to berecycled.andM;Information in the catalog automates the monitoring of days since lastcleaned, so tapes can be cleaned and certified before data is lost.andO;Similarly, the catalog tracks errors associated with each tape, to preventundue CPU resource in error recovery processing.andM;The reporting capabilities of these packages provide a new level of automatedcontrol over the tape resource.andM;Information regarding tape inventory across sites, retention status, tapeerrors by vendor cleaning and certification history, date last used, and usecounts are just a sampling of the types of report information.andM;HOW HEUBLIN HANDLED A MERGERandM;Bill Mathvink, data center manager for for operations at Heublein Inc.,andO;believes the MVS tape management software his company purchased years ago isessential to managing the tape resource at his company's Hartford,Conn.-based data center.andP;  Today, the data center has 13,000 volumes in itstape library.andM;In 1984, Mathvink and his staff faced a tremendous challenge when the size ofthe library doubled from 6,000 to 12,000 volumes literally overnight.andP;  Thesudden growth occurred when another data center was consolidated with theHartford operation.andM;Almost all of the tapes in the library are associated with the company's MVSoperation.andP;  A large VM system primarily supports end-user interactiveapplications and generates tapes only for backup and historical purposes.andO;These tapes are few in number and controlled through both purchased softwareand an internally generated program.andM;Mathvink captures the sentiments of many other data processing managers whenhe states unequivocally, &quot; &quot;I can't imagine life without our MVS tapemanagement software.andP;  In fact, I don't see how a data center could existwithout a similar tool.andP;  The benefits to us have been substantial.andP;  Mostimportanly, we have avoided accidental destruction of data and the costlyreruns associated with mounting the wrong tape.andM;&quot;We have also managed to handle our tape library without a full-time tapelibrarian, even when growth doubled unexpectedly in 1984.andP;  The manualfunctions which do remain are handled by our regular operators during thecourse of each shift,&quot; Mathvink said.andM;Dennis F. Pasternak, the assistant vice president of computer services atFederal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, has utilized a similar package tomanage the tape resource in a VM/SE environment.andP;  This package has beenmodified to incorporate tapes in the company's DEC and Unisys systems forcentralized managment of offsite vaulting.andM;Although the library at this Indianapolis-based data center consists of about2,700 tapes and is still relatively small, the benefits have beensignificant.andM;According to Pasternak, &quot;Prior to the purchase of our tape managementsoftware package several years ago, we had a tape librarian dedicatedfull-time to the manual tasks associated with managing tapes.andP;  By automatingmuch of this function, we are now able to manage the tape library with ourregular operations staff.andP;  Tape management has gone from a major,time-consuming function to a very minor one.andP;  This new level of automationwill also ensure that tape management remains a minor function as our librarygrows in the years to come.&quot;andM;Tape management software also plays an important role at the Olan Mills datacenter.andP;  This data center is one of many large VSE installations which haveemerged across the country in recent years.andP;  The tape library at the OlanMills data center includes 12,000 tapes which are used primarily for back-upand historical fiiles.andP;  Prior to the purchase of the company's first tapemanagement package 13 years ago, Olan Mills employed a full-time tapelibrarian to manage the tape library.andM;According to Pete Clark, &quot;The benefits of our software investment were morethan justified.andP;  We were immediately able to eliminate the tape librarianposition.andP;  We also realized significant savings in costly reruns.andP;  An addedbenefit was the decrease in pressure on our operations staff.andP;  Our operatorsno longer needed to live in fear of mounting the wrong tape.&quot;andM;Clark points out that tape management software can also simplify otheraspects of managing data stored on tape: &quot;Our tape management software allowsus to totally eliminate the ASSIGN statement from our JCL.andP;  In addition, wecan now reblock tape files directly by simply changing the blocking factor inthe tape catalog.andP;  We can also switch the media by simply changing the mediatype in the catalog from tape to disk or vice versa.andP;  There is no longer aneed to make that change in the program itself.&quot;andM;Software packages designed to automate specific areas of the tape managementfunction are also available from a variety of vendors.andM;For example, Main Frame Software Products Corporation, Wellesley, Mass.,andO;markets Tapeview, a PC-based product which provides console information thatis specifically designed to increase operator efficiency when handling tapemounts in the VM and MVS.andP;  In addition, many vendors offer tape managementsoftware packages for non-IBM operating system environments.andP;  (Seeaccompanying list.)andM;OTHER ALTERNATIVESandM;Although tape management software is the most powerful approach to automatingthe tape function, there are complementary ways to further reduce the cost ofmaintaing a tape library.andM;The organization of the library itself is critcal.andP;  Color-coded labeling ofstorage areas and associated tape volumes further minimize the potential forplacing a tape in the wrong storage slot.andP;  Olan Mills, Heublein Inc., andFederal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis use color-coded numerics to helpensure that tapes are stored in the correct slot.andM;Reorganization of the tape library to minimize the distance between thestorage area and the drives is also worthy of consideration, particularly inlarge tape complexes.andP;  Dedicating drives to specific applications and placingdrives in close proximity to the associated storage areas can reduce thedistance tapes must be transported to complete a mount.andP;  Color coding incombination with such an organization is effective.andM;Legent Corp. (formerly Duquesne Systems), Pittsburgh, provides softwaresupport for tape pooling and assignment of specific drives to specificapplications in the company's Multi-image Manager offerings for VM and MVSenvironments.andM;Intelligent racking systems for tape storage areas also offer the promise ofincreased efficiency in handling tapes.andP;  One such system uses lightedindicators at each storage slot to indicate whether a tape should becollected for scratch, vaulting, or a specific mount.andM;Another innovation which has only recently been applied to tape management isthe use of bar code labels and scanners to eliminate errors in retrieving andmoving tapes across locations.andM;This approach is excellent for identifying misfiled and misplaced tapes.andP;  Itis also valuable in streamlining routine inventories of tapes at eachlocation.andP;  American Eagle Systems, Riverhead, N.Y., offers a bar codescanning system which reconciles with vault picking lists generated bypopular MVS tape management software.andM;The use of the newer 3480-type tape drive can also result in benefits to thetape operation.andP;  these drives use higher density media and new, smallercartridge packaging.andP;  As a result, more data can be stored on a single tape,and each tape requires a smaller storage area.andM;In addition, the new drives can be fitted with an automatic cartridge loaderthat allows additional cartridges to be automatically mounted when thecurrently mounted cartridge has completed processing.andP;  This innovation canreduce the personnel requirements for handling tape mounts.andM;The benefits of moving to the new tape technology must be weighed against thecost of purchasing new tape drives and the cost of converting to the newmedia.andP;  This should include any expenses for new storage racks specificallydesigned to handle cartridges.andM;Many installations have opted to bypass the conversion issue and limit use ofthe new drives to creation of new tapes.andP;  Over time, the cartridge media willthen become the predominate technology in use, but the impact of an outrightconversion will have been avoided.andM;Pete Clark warns that the higher density 3480 catridges may result in onlylimited tape savings if block sizes are not addressed when the conversions isundertaken.andP;  Clark says, &quot;When we first moved to 3480 drives we did notadjust block sizes.andP;  As a result, we were only able to reduce our total tapelibrary by only 400 to 500 tapes.andM;&quot;These savings resulted primarily from converting multivolume files spanningthree volumes or more,&quot; he went on.andP;  &quot;We have further obtained additionalsavings by requiring that all tape files utilize a blocking factor of atleast 16K, and preferably 24K or 32K.&quot;andM;Still another hardware alternative for larger installations is the automatedtape library.andP;  This approach allows cartridges to be stored in a largeautomated library facility which automatically mounts, demounts and returnsthe cartridges to their storage slots in the library without manualintervention.andP;  The benefits of such an approach are obvious: tapes are nevertouched by human hands once they have been loaded into the library.andM;A key piece of the storage management equation is development of a cost permagabyte of storing data on tape, including all manpower requirementsassociated with the handling of tapes.andM;Any organization seriously considering installation of an automated storagelibrary should also determine the current cost of storing the same data onDASD until it is no longer referenced.andP;  Again, the cost effectiveness of anystorage solution over another will vary with each installation and with thelevel of efficiency already in place to manage that particular option.andM;OPTICAL STORAGE ON HORIZONandM;Although there is much talk of optical storage superceding tape in the yearsto come, an optical device which supports both read and write operations, andalso offers desirable access times, has yet to be introduced for themainframe environment.andM;Optical media as a wholesale replacement for tape will not be a viable optionfor most installations in the near term.andP;  During that same time period, thecost of DASD should continue to decline, making it a more attractive optionfor data sets which are still referenced.andM;As stated previously, many organizations continue to increase the proportionof data sets residing on DASD.andP;  Conversely, they are attempting to limit tapeusage to two functions: backup copies and historical copies.andP;  In bothinstances, the copies must be stored offsite and its transportability makestape the best fit.andM;Like it or not, tape continues to play a critical role in the modern datacenter; however, most data center managers agree the minimizing that rolemakes the best business sense.andM;To that end, Mathvink hopes to limit tape usage to backup, historical, andonly the largest sequential files.andP;  &quot;From a strictly selfish operationalstandpoint, I wish we never had to mount a tape again,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;My primary goal for data center operations at Heublein is to minimize theuse of tape and add the tools necessary to achieve full automation of ouroperations as soon as possible,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;This is the only way that wecan manage future growth without adding significant overhead to ouroperations.&quot;andM;USER GOALSandM;To further automate management of the company's tape library, Mathvinkintends to investigate a bar code tape identification system and the use ofmore sophisticated storage racks.andM;At the Bank of Indianpolis, Dennis Pasternak has already limited use of tapeto backup ahd historical file copies.andP;  Pasternak's next goal is to bring in3480-type tape drives for the higher densities and automatic cartridge loadercapabilities offered by these devices.andM;At Olan Mills, Pete Clark hopes to add automatic cartridge loaders to thecompany's 3480 drives.andP;  Clark would also like to generate an online listingof the tape volumes required to service jobs in the queue.andP;  He believes sucha move would help further streamline tape management at Olan Mills.andM;&quot;The capability would let us use cartridge loaders for both input and outputprocessing.andP;  My goal is to allow our operators to preload groups of tapes inthe cartridge loader and then attend to other activities while the tapes areprocessed,&quot; Clark said.andM;Elimination of tape and the manual tasks associated with its management maybe the ultimate goal at most installations, but there appears to be no easyway to get from here to there in the near term.andM;Whatever the future may bring, it is clear that most data centers willcontinue to face the challenge of tape management with new and innovativesolutions for many years to come.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
