Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to say what ``low priorityprograms'' are under consideration to be eliminated.   He said the budget would call for no new taxes, would not``tamper with Social Security'' and would include a defense spendingbuildup that does more than just keep up with inflation.   He said the proposal would meet the deficit reduction of theGramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, which would mean reductions ofat least $32 billion to reduce the fiscal 1989 budget to $100billion.   Fitzwater said the budget is aimed at achieving a balanced budgetby fiscal 1993.   He said the review of agency budgets by the Office of Managementand Budget would be completed this week and the OMB proposals wouldthen be submitted to the agencies, which will have a right of appealfrom the budget office decisions before the White House takes thebudget proposal to Congress, which has the final say in that it mustappropriate money to run the government.</TEXT></DOC>
