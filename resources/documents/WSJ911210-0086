GM officials have indicated in recent weeks that thecompany will speed up a broad cost-reduction effort begun inFebruary. GM said then that it planned to cut 15,000 jobsfrom its white-collar payrolls by 1993, starting with 6,000this year. Now, company officials are signaling that thosereductions may come more quickly -- probably throughsweetened buy-out and early retirement deals.</LP><TEXT>   But GM, which had a loss of $2.2 billion in the first ninemonths of this year, apparently disappointed someshareholders by not announcing any bold moves yesterday. GM'scommon closed at $27.625, down $1.375, as 2.5 million shareschanged hands in composite trading on the New York StockExchange. It was the lowest GM shares had been since December1987.   &quot;The stock is in free fall,&quot; said Lehman Brothers analystJoseph Phillippi. &quot;Things are clearly worse today than anyoneexpected.&quot;   The slumping stock adds to the pressure mounting on RobertC. Stempel, GM's chairman, and his senior management, whohave been trying to pursue a step-by-step course oforganizational reform even as the recession battered GM'sprofit and balance sheet.   Mr. Stempel has said repeatedly that he wants to avoidsweeping reorganizations and plant closings of the sort thatcharacterized the cost-cutting efforts of his predecessor,Roger B. Smith.   But many analysts, investors and credit-rating concernsargue that GM should move more quickly to cut overhead in theface of a stubborn recession.   &quot;Ford produces 45% more vehicles per U.S. salariedemployee than GM,&quot; Wertheim Schroder analyst John Casesa saidyesterday. Even considering that GM has more parts-makingoperations than Ford, Mr. Casesa argues that the disparitysuggests GM would have to cut its salaried work force by 20%to 30%, or between 20,000 and 30,000 people, to match Ford'sproductivity in this measure.   Because of GM's high overhead and labor costs, the companyis expected to lose as much as $2.8 billion this year, themost of the Big Three. GM posted a $2 billion loss for 1990,including a $2.1 billion charge for plant closings. Someanalysts now question whether the No. 1 auto maker will turna profit next year unless the U.S. economy makes a roaringcomeback.   The gloomy outlook recently prompted the majorcredit-rating concerns to put GM's debt under review for apossible downgrade. Standard andamp; Poor's Inc. has told GM it hasuntil late February or early March to convince Sandamp;P that ithas an aggressive plan to cut expenses and regainprofitability.   Mr. Stempel may begin outlining his plans at a pressbriefing scheduled for Dec. 18. That briefing had beenscheduled for today but was postponed. Company officials saidthe delay was to avoid a conflict with GM's sale of as muchas $1.5 billion of preference stock. The first $1 billion ofthat stock was priced last week.   Mr. Stempel has said that GM has a plan to operate itsNorth American factories at capacity by the end of 1992 andto cut its overhead costs to bring them more in line withthose of its competitors. But investors remain skeptical.   &quot;There's only so much you can do with promises,&quot; saidRoland MacHold, director of investment for New Jersey's statepension funds, which own GM shares.</TEXT></DOC>
