Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GWF GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Great Western Bank, the nation's second-largest healthy thrift, unveiled a bold attempt to escape from the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and switch into the healthier Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    It isn't clear whether the move by the main unit of Great Western Financial Corp. will succeed. But if Great Western manages to switch into the FDIC and take advantage of its lower deposit-insurance premiums, it definitely will deal a psychological and financial blow to the already battered FSLIC.    &quot;It's an important symbolic gesture,&quot; said Eric I. Hemel, a thrift analyst with First Boston Corp. and a former official of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts and controls the FSLIC.    &quot;It does force greater attention to the issue. The FSLIC was insolvent already, but the FSLIC without Great Western appears even weaker, if that's possible,&quot; Mr. Hemel said.    The move requires two approvals each from the Bank Board and the FDIC. In an interview, Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said his agency has doubts about whether Great Western has the legal authority to switch to the FDIC. Congress has barred thrifts from switching out the the FSLIC until next August, but Great Western claims it qualifies under a &quot;grandfather clause&quot; allowing thrifts that took certain steps to switch out before March 31, 1987, to continue the process.    But Mr. Wall said &quot;we have some pretty serious questions&quot; about whether the actions that Great Western cites in its application are sufficient to claim grandfathering rights under the law.    Mr. Wall said the FSLIC would miss Great Western's annual deposit-insurance premiums of about $40 million if the thrift leaves, but noted that the amount is a relatively small part of the FSLIC's annual premium cash flow of about $2.2 billion.    Mr. Wall also said the approval process might take about &quot;four or five months.&quot;    An FDIC spokesman said his agency would be obligated to approve the application if Great Western satisfies &quot;all appropriate statutory and supervisory requirements.&quot;    If Great Western's plan succeeds, the thrift will save at least $25 million a year because of the FDIC's lower deposit-insurance premium rate, and is likely to be able to reduce the rates it pays customers on their deposits. In addition, Great Western claims it is exempt from an exit fee that Congress imposed in 1987 on thrifts that leave the FSLIC. In Great Western's case, that fee would be about $80 million, equal to two years' total premiums to the FSLIC.    Despite the potential cost savings and boost to earnings, shares of Great Western Financial didn't budge yesterday, closing at $16.25 each, unchanged in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Analysts said the lackluster market response indicated investors remain unconvinced that Great Western's plan will succeed.    Analysts said Great Western had devised a creative way around the FSLIC exit fee and the law barring exits from the FSLIC. Great Western claims that it qualified for an exemption because it wrote a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; on March 30, 1987, for a merger of Great Western Bank into a very small Utah-based FDIC-insured subsidiary of Great Western Financial, called Great Western Thrift andamp; Loan.    Great Western contends the memo gave Great Western Bank a right to leave the FSLIC even though it currently is proposing a different transaction. Great Western Bank, based in California, wants to merge with a separate unit of the same holding company that is a Washington state chartered, FDIC-insured savings bank.    Great Western acquired the Washington state unit, called Great Western Savings Bank, earlier this year. The Washington state unit, which regulators agreed was grandfathered, completed its own switch to the FDIC from the FSLIC Sept. 14.    James F. Montgomery, chairman of Great Western Financial and Great Western Bank, said, &quot;it has long been Great Western's objective to minimize the expense of federal deposit insurance to the shareholders of this company.&quot;    Analysts said the move, even if it fails, may make Congress less likely to force healthy thrifts to pay more money to help bail out the FSLIC. &quot;I think Montgomery has put Congress on notice that they will not be able to easily confiscate the income and net worth of the healthy thrifts to help solve FSLIC's problems,&quot; said Peter Treadway, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    Great Western Bank -- which has assets of about $28 billion -- is the nation's third-largest thrift, ranking behind the healthy Home Savings of America unit of H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co. in Los Angeles and the deeply troubled American Savings based in Stockton, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
