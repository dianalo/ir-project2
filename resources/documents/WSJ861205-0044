Lots of luck, right? In the current climate of red-ink-stained network sports operations and advertisers disillusioned with sporting events, one might think they'll be fortunate to get the envelopes, let alone a healthy bid.    Guess again. Today, anyone who can get away with a sealed-bid auction -- previously done only by the Olympics -- must have some leverage. &quot;It's just a 100% blue-ribbon event,&quot; says Donn Bernstein, director of college sports for ABC Sports.    College basketball is an odd candidate for such an exalted state. The game suffers from the same over-saturation that has hurt other sports. And ratings generally aren't eye-poppers. Last year, college games on both CBS and NBC averaged a 4.6 rating during the regular season. (Each rating point represents 1% of the nation's 87.4 million televisions.) The championship game on CBS in prime-time earned a 20.7 rating -- good, but not in a league with the Super Bowl or &quot;The Cosby Show.&quot;    But unlike some other major sports, college basketball has continued to be profitable for the networks. Advertisers have been willing to pay a premium, partly thanks to timing; the college basketball season comes early in the year between football and baseball. And the NCAA Tournament has been a big media attention-getter in recent years.    The networks' hunger for college basketball has led to some high drama and touchy politics in the current negotiations, which involve all three major commercial networks. The result, says Peter Lund, president of CBS Sports, is that the NCAA will get &quot;a whale of a lot more money&quot; for tournament rights.    Some network sources think the NCAA can double the $96 million CBS paid to televise the tournament for the three years through 1987. NCAA member schools will divide 60% of the money, and the association gets the rest. Proceeds from the basketball tournament constitute 75% of the NCAA's annual budget.    When CBS outbid NBC for the tournament in 1982, the latter was left with a bunch of regular-season games that built up to nothing. Subsequent threats by NBC to pull out of college-basketball coverage altogether -- unless it got a piece of the tournament action -- worried athletic-conference commissioners, who peddle their own regular-season TV packages. They also feared that CBS's extensive contract with the Big East conference would limit their opportunities on that network.    &quot;We felt it was in our best interest to get into two networks to keep (NBC) in the regular season,&quot; says Wayne Duke, commissioner of the Big Ten conference.    The plot thickened this year, when ABC jumped into college hoops, scheduling 10 games over eight weeks and entering the tournament bidding war. &quot;Our new management wanted a new live package in the first quarter,&quot; Mr. Bernstein says, &quot;and we could put together an attractive package and do it at a profit.&quot;    CBS had an exclusive negotiating period written into its contract, but that expired Nov. 20. Network sources indicate that the NCAA Tournament Committee wasn't satisfied with CBS's offer and felt obligated to pursue the possibility of a two-network deal. &quot;There's a feeling we have the opportunity to find the true value of the property because for the first time in many years, all three networks are interested,&quot; says Dick Schultz, the University of Virginia athletic director, who heads the tournament committee.    Many expect the NCAA will strike a deal with two networks, but Mr. Schultz insists that isn't set in concrete. He recognizes the advantage of having two networks promoting the tournament, but worries that the value of the tournament will slide with two networks selling advertising in an already overcrowded marketplace. &quot;If you're interested just in money, you stick with one network, because there's a premium for exclusivity,&quot; he explains.    A tiebreaker in the negotiations could be the networks' willingness to put more of the tournament in prime-time, something they haven't been willing to do with many sports events lately.    More will be known tomorrow, when the NCAA has promised to respond to the networks' sealed bids, which will include one based on an exclusive arrangement and one based on a two-network split. Nothing is binding; the committee could choose one or select one or two for further negotiations. &quot;It's going to be interesting,&quot; says CBS's Mr. Lund. &quot;They can do anything they want.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
