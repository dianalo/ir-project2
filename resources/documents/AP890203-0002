A band of freezing rain extended from Texas to New England; heavysnow was reported in parts of the central Rockies; and wind-chillreadings hit 75 below or lower in parts of Montana, the Dakotas andWyoming.   The cold and snow led to a short workday for state workers inMontana, unexpected school and university holidays in several statesand highway accidents. Ranchers reported that newborn calves weredying in the cold, and citrus growers took precautions to keep thedeep freeze from harming their crops.   The misery stemmed from an ocean of cold air that poured downfrom Alaska early in the week, after a shift in the jet stream. Bymidday Thursday, its effects in the Lower 48 were being felt acrossa vast, roughly triangular area from the Pacific Northwest to Texasto New England, areas that had enjoyed in many cases their warmestJanuary in years.   Bostonians enjoyed a record-high 66 degrees Wednesday.Twenty-four hours later, the city shivered in 31-degree air, andlight freezing rain was falling.   In Montana, which continued to post the lowest temperaturesoutside Alaska, Gov. Stan Stephens sent all non-essential stateworkers home Thursday. The capital, Helena, grappled not only withthe bitter cold but with a train derailment and explosion thatforced the evacuation of thousands of people and disruptedelectrical power.   Montana's two largest universities shut down through the weekend.   ``It's not the cold, because we've been open in much colderweather,'' said Bill Tietz, president of Montana State University atBozeman. ``It's the wind chill we're concerned about.''   Classes were canceled at many South Dakota schools because of thewind chill and blowing snow. Schools also were closed North Dakota,Oregon and elsewhere.   Temperatures overnight dipped to 34 below in three Montana towns:Great Falls, Lewistown, and Cut Bank; and their wind-chill readingswere as low as 78 below. In Billings, the record low for a Feb. 2used to be 13 degrees below zero; on Thursday, it went to 28 below,and 20 below was the high for the day.   In all, six record lows for the date were posted, includingAstoria, Ore., with 18 above; Casper, Wyo., 27 below; and Sheridan,Wyo., 28 below.   But temperature records at the other end of the scale, though notso widespread as on Wednesday, also were racked up Thursday. Nearly30 record highs were set, including Asheville, N.C., 76 degrees;Cape Hatteras, N.C., 74; Charlotte, N.C., 80; Norfolk, Va. 80;Richmond, Va., 78; and Wilmington, N.C., 80.   In Alaska, temperatures remained in the cellar near the Canadianborder but warmed up elsewhere. Early Thursday it was 37 degrees atAdak in the Aleutian Islands, and 59 degrees below zero at Northway.   At least four traffic fatalities were blamed on the weather, andin Edmonds, Wash., a 35-year-old utility worker died Thursday whenhe fell while trying to repair a downed power line.   In Martin, S.D., a 50-year-old man was found dead Thursdaymorning in a vacant lot. Bennett County Chief Deputy Sheriff CraigDillon said the man's death apparently was caused by exposure. Theovernight temperature in Martin was about 25 below zero, with a windchill of 60 below.   The man ``fell down and you could see where he struggled in thesnow to regain his feet, but he was unable to do so,'' Dillon said.   But a life was saved in North Dakota, when searchers Thursdayfound a 16-year-old boy who got lost Monday while driving to hisfamily's farm. Bennett Stebleton of rural Egeland was coherent but``too wrung out to show any emotion'' aside from saying ``I'mthankful that I'm alive,'' said volunteer rescuer Greg Mitchell.   The boy, who had only light clothing and car mats to keep himwarm, had badly frostbitten feet and hands and was hospitalized instable condition. Overnight temperatures in the area had plunged to30 degrees below zero.   Heaviest snow was reported in the Rockies. Craig, Colo., reported6 new inches by midmorning, while 11{ inches were reported innorthern Larimer County, Colo., and 4 inches at Laramie, Wyo. Snowalso fell in the upper Midwest.   In northern California, snow blanketed the Sierra, dusted SanFrancisco Bay area mountains and fell over beachfront communities.   Freezing rain extended as far south as Texas, and forecasterssaid there was a chance that below-freezing temperatures couldextend to the southern part of the state by the weekend.   Nervous citrus growers in south Texas, still recovering from adevastating freeze in 1983, were taking precautions, officials said.   ``As people have been leaving my store today I've been tellingthem to go to church Sunday and pray for us,'' said Mardy Eggersfrom her family's Rio Grande Valley citrus farm, Eggers Acres.   Montana ranchers said cattle were giving birth to calves thatdied from exposure within hours.   One rancher, Dr. George Ingham, said he lost two calves.   ``We had one up and nursing, and came back and that big100-pounder was dead,'' Ingham said. ``It's the wind chill out onthis prairie.''   Workers at Double M Farms feedlot near Kearney, Neb., putacetylene torches to some water tanks for cattle, part-owner SteveMercer said. They also had to stir the cattle feed so it wouldn'tfreeze.   Power outages blamed on the weather were reported in Washington,Montana, Utah and Nebraska. Officials in Norfolk, Neb., theorizedthat a power line contracted so tightly in 58 below wind-chills thatit just snapped.   Still, there were signs that people were getting used to theweather.   ``A lot more people are staying home,'' Portland, Ore., policespokesman Henry Groepper said Thursday. ``Traffic was definitelylighter today ... (and) I think people have just adjusted more tothe weather.''   Forecasters said the deep freeze would last for at least a fewmore days in most affected areas.</TEXT></DOC>
