Static and gas-liquid partition chromatographic methodswere used for the study of hydrogen-phenanthrene and methane-phenanthrenesystems. The static data for these two binaries were taken along 398.2,423.2, 448.2, and 473.2 K isotherms up to 25.23 MPa. Gas-liquid partitionchromatography was used to study the infinite dilution behavior of methane,ethane, propane, n-butane, and carbon dioxide in the hydrogen-phenanthrenesystem as well as hydrogen, ethane, n-butane, and carbon dioxide in themethane-phenanthrene binary. The principle objective was to examine therole of the elution gas. Temperatures were along the same isotherms asthe static data and up to 20.77 MPa. With the exception of carbon dioxide,Henry's constants were calculated for all systems. Expressions for theheat of solution as a function of pressure were derived for both binaryand chromatographic data. Estimates of delta H/sub i/sup sol/ at highpressure were presented.</TEXT></DOC>
