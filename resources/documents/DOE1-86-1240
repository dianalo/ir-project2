The results show that the scientific authenticity and efficiencyof fundamental and applied investigations in the field of experimentalmutagenesis of cotton plants,being a facultative self-polinator, dependon keeping necessary methodical requirements. Application of inbreedinglines of genetic collection with marker features as the initial material,isolation of plants usinng self-polination of flowers on all stages ofinvestigation are related to these requirements. Several methodical recommendationson genetic-selective investigations are developed. 37 refs.; 4 figs.;11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
