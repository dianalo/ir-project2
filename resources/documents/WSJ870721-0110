Merrill officials said the company had one-time, after-tax gains of $48.3 million from the sale of its residential real estate network and $76.2 million from the sale of part of its leasing business. The results also were helped by Merrill's leveraged buyout operations, which closed two large transactions in the quarter. People close to the buyout transactions put their combined pre-tax earnings for Merrill at about $59 million.    Merrill's second-quarter net income was down 8.5% from the year-ago quarter's $91.1 million, or 86 cents a share on fewer shares outstanding. Revenue increased 4.6% to $2.44 billion from $2.33 billion.    Company officials had earlier set the trading loss, one of the largest single losses in Wall Street history, at $275 million before taxes. Yesterday, officials said that $377 million had actually been lost before taxes on the trading of a risky new mortgage vehicle in which the principal portion of the mortgage security is traded separately from the interest.    Merrill said it arrived at the $275 million figure after setting the $377 million loss off against special reserves the firm had set up in 1986 for such an extraordinary event. Another small portion of the loss was offset by funds from a bonus pool set aside for the mortgage department. Merrill officials said they previously disclosed only the $275 million figure because it represented the material effect that the trading mishap had on the company's pre-tax results. After taxes, the trading loss came to about $155 million, the firm said.    The stock market reacted favorably. Merrill's common stock closed at $35.75, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    &quot;If you take out the trading loss, it's a pretty good quarter,&quot; said Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Corp. The performance was better than analysts had been expecting, Mr. Eckenfelder and other analysts said, because the results included the previously undisclosed sale of a portfolio of leases for $76.2 million. Merrill wouldn't disclose the purchaser or the types of leases sold, at the request of the purchaser, a spokesman said.    When Merrill announced the trading loss in late April, the securities firm said it still hoped to record a profit for the quarter. &quot;I wasn't projecting in my own head that it would be that high,&quot; said William A. Schreyer, Merrill's chairman and chief executive officer.    Merrill's announcement that its trading losses actually totalled $377 million and that it had created special reserves for trading losses and other special situations created a great deal of interest on Wall Street.    Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Services Corp. and a frequent critic of Merrill's management, said he wondered why the firm didn't disclose the $377 million figure earlier. But Mr. Eckenfelder said, &quot;You might argue (Merrill) should have released the gross number, but keep in mind that most firms wouldn't have&quot; disclosed as much information as Merrill did. Brokerage firms generally don't break out trading losses by product or even by department.    &quot;We had both numbers&quot; at the time of the original disclosure, said Bruce Brunson, the company's treasurer. He said that the impact on shareholders, which is the $275 million figure, is &quot;typically what one discloses.&quot;    Merrill officials wouldn't give further details about the size of the reserve fund or the bonus pool that help offset the trading loss. Richard B. Stewart Jr., Merrill's controller, said the firm has begun slowly rebuilding the reserve fund, which he stressed was voluntarily set up by the company last year and is completely separate from the reserves Merrill and other securities firms must keep for regulatory purposes. He said building up the reserves wouldn't have a material effect on the future quarters' earnings.    Merrill's investment banking revenue rose 27% to $293 million in the quarter on the strength of the two large leveraged buyout transactions. Merrill led groups in leveraged buyouts of Borg-Warner Corp. for $4.7 billion, and Supermarkets General Corp. for $2.1 billion. The investment banking department's revenue included $45 million in fees from Borg-Warner and $14 million from Supermarkets General, individuals close to the transactions said. Additional financing and banking fees will be recorded in the third quarter, the individuals said.    The previously reported public sale through a master limited partnership of about a 25% stake in Merrill's residential real estate network brought the firm $48.3 million. When the firm announced that it wanted to sell the unit last fall, officials said they hoped to receive $500 million for the entire unit. One Merrill official said the disappointing return from the real estate sale was due to a significant drop off in the market for master limited partnerships after Merrill had decided to use that form of sale. Unlike standard partnerships, master limited partnerships are publicly traded on stock exchanges, thus offering liquidity to investors.    For the six months, Merrill's earnings were up 7.9% to $192 million, or $1.75 a share, compared with last year's $177.9 million, or $1.71 a share on fewer shares outstanding. Revenue increased 14% to $5.14 billion from $4.51 billion in last year's first half. </TEXT></DOC>
