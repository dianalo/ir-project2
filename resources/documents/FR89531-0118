As a result, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis wasnot prepared. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The current countervailing duty regulations in Subparts A, B, and C of19 CFR Part 355 (53 FR 52306; December 27, 1988) are based on SubtitlesA, C, and D of Title I of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39;July 26, 1979) (``Trade Agreements Act''), which amended section 303 andTitle VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1303, and Subtitle IV, PartsI, III and IV) (``Tariff Act''). Title VI of the Trade and Tariff Act of1984 (Pub. L. 98-573; October 30, 1984) (``1984 Act'') and Part 2, SubtitleC, Title I of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Pub. L.100-418; August 23, 1988) (``1988 Act'') further amended the countervailingduty provisions of the Tariff Act. The current regulations relating tosubsidies on quota cheese in Subpart D of 19 CFR Part 355 are based onsection 702 of the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 1202 note). These regulations codify much of the Department's existing practice withrespect to the identification and measurement of subsidies under the countervailingduty (``CVD'') law. We are promulgating regulations at this time for severalreasons. First, it long has been the Department's intent to promulgate methodologicalregulations once the Department had gained sufficient experience with theadministration of the CVD law. See ``Notice of Final Rules and Requestfor Comments,'' 45 FR 4932 (1980). Having administered the law for nineyears, we now feel confident in codifying certain administrative practicesin the form of regulations. Second, we believe that a codification of administrative practice at thistime will streamline proceedings for both parties to CVD proceedings andDepartment officials. Although Department administrative precedents arepublished, the number of precedents has grown to such an extent that thebody of case law has become unwieldy. In addition, while the writings ofcurrent and former Department officials provide useful summaries of theDepartment's CVD methodology, these writings are unofficial and partiescannot rely upon them with certainty. Third, in two recent decisions, the U.S. Court of International Trade (``CIT'')has criticized the Department for relying upon the methodological appendixattached to the final determination on <T3>Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina, </T3>49FR 18016 (1984) (hereinafter referred to as ``Subsidies Appendix'') withoutfirst engaging in rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.<T3>Ipsco, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>687 F. Supp. 614 (1988); and <T3>Saudi Iron and Steel Co. (Hadeed) </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>686 F. Supp. 914 (1988). According to the CIT,because the Department allegedly was treating the practices in questionas if they were rules, within the meaning of the Administrative ProcedureAct, the Department either had to undertake rulemaking procedures or justifyits use of these methodologies on a case-by-case basis. Although we donot necessarily agree with the CIT's conclusion that rulemaking is required,<T3>see SEC </T3>v. <T3>Chenery, </T3>332 U.S. 194 (1947); <T3>see also generally </T3>Weaver, <T3>Chenery II: A Forty-Year Perspective, </T3>40 Admin. L. Rev. 161 (1988),assuming, <T3>arguendo, </T3>that those decisions are correct, it remains difficultto predict exactly which aspects of the Department's methodology requirerulemaking and which do not. Therefore, the issuance of regulations willrestore the certainty and predictability to the administration of the CVDlaw which may have been undermined by <T3>Ipsco </T3>and <T3>Hadeed. </T3>These proposed regulations are not limited to those matters contained inthe Subsidies Appendix, which dealt largely with the valuation of subsidies.These regulations attempt to codify the Department's practice with respectto both the identification and measurement of those types of foreign governmentprograms most frequently encountered by the Department. Changes from existingpractice are noted, where applicable. Conceptually, the regulations are based upon the economic model articulatedby the Department in its final determinations in <T3>Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Czechoslovakia </T3>and <T3>Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Poland, see, e.g., </T3>49 FR 19375 (1984),and sustained by the court in <T3>Georgetown Steel Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>801 F.2d 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1986). This model, whichgenerally defines a subsidy as a distortion of the market process for allocatingan economy's resources, underlies the Department's entire CVD methodology.Structurally, these proposed regulations are organized as follows. Exceptwhere otherwise noted, these regulations appear as subpart D to Part 355of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Current subpart D (quotacheese) is redesignated as subpart E. Section 355.41 contains a list of definitions. To the extent possible,we have attempted to rely on the definitions contained in andSection; 355.2of the current regulations. However, where this was not possible, we havecreated new definitions for purposes of subpart D. Section 355.42 contains a basic, two-element definition of a countervailablesubsidy. Sections 355.43 and 355.44 elaborate on each of these elements.Section 355.45 codifies certain aspects of the Department's practice withrespect to upstream subsidies. Section 355.46 deals with offsets to grossbenefits. Section 355.47 deals with the assignment of a benefit to a particularproduct or market, a topic generally referred to within the Departmentunder the rubric of ``tying.'' Section 355.48 codifies existing practiceconcerning the timing of receipt of benefits. Section 355.49 deals withthe assignment of benefits to a particular year or years. Section 355.50codifies Department practice with respect to program-wide changes. Finally,andSection; 355.51 codifies existing practice concerning the calculationof country-wide subsidy rates. The regulations incorporated in this proposed rule are described in thefollowing section-by-section analysis. 1. <T3>Section 355.41. </T3>Section 355.41 contains a list of definitionsof terms used in subpart D. The definitions are largely self-explanatory,but a few warrant comment. The term ``government'' in paragraph (b) includes an entity controlledby a government. Thus, for example, the sale of a good by a government-ownedcorporation could constitute the provision of a good by a government forpurposes of andSection; 355.44(f).Section 355.41 does not define industry, which in subpart D is used largelyin the context of the specificity test set forth in andSection; 355.43(b).However, andSection; 355.2(h) of the current regulations contains a definitionof ``industry'' which is inappropriate in the context of subpart D. Therefore,we are amending andSection; 355.2(h) so as to render that provision inapplicableto subpart D. We also are amending andSection; 355.2 of the current regulations by addinga new paragraph (r) which defines the term ``program.'' Although the word``program'' is used throughout the current regulations, and is used extensivelyin the new subpart D of these proposed rules, it currently is undefined.Paragraph (r) defines ``program'' as any act or practice of a foreign government.It must be emphasized, however, that the use of this term is for purposesof convenience; it is not intended to limit the universe of countervailablesubsidies to certain routinized actions of a foreign government. Thus,for example, equity infusions in a firm by a government, which tend tobe isolated acts, would be regarded as a program for purposes of the regulations.2. <T3>Section 355.42. </T3>This section defines the two elements which arenecessary in order to find a subsidy which is actionable (<T3>i.e., </T3>countervailable) under the Act: (a) Selective treatment;and (b) a countervailable benefit. In the numerous decisions under theAct by the Department and the courts since 1980, these two elements haveemerged as the prerequisites for a countervailable subsidy. Sections 355.43and 355.44 of these proposed regulations elaborate on each of these elements.The necessity for each of these elements can be demonstrated by a few simplehypothetical situations. For example, the nonexcessive rebate upon exportationby a foreign government of final stage indirect taxes provides selectivetreatment in that the rebate is limited to exporters. However, there isno countervailable benefit (and, thus, no countervailable subsidy), becausethe nonexcessive rebate of final stage indirect taxes is permissible underdomestic law and international rules. See,<T3> e.g., </T3><T3>Zenith Radio Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>437 U.S. 443 (1978); and item (g) of the IllustrativeList of Export Subsidies annexed to the Agreement on Interpretation andApplication of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, <T3>opened for signature </T3>Apr. 12, 1979, 31 U.S.T. 513, T.I.A.S. No.9619, <T3>reprinted in Agreements Reached in the Tokyo Round of MultilateralTrade Negotiations, </T3>H.R. Doc. No. 153, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (pt.1) 257 (1979) (``the Subsidies Code''). Conversely, a foreign governmentmay introduce a tax credit to encourage new investment. The credit is claimedby a variety of firms, but cannot be used by those firms not purchasingnew plant and equipment. All the firms that use the tax credit clearlyreceive a benefit in the form of a tax savings. However, there is no selectivetreatment (and, thus, no countervailable subsidy), because the tax creditis not targeted to specific firms or industries within the economy. Paragraph (b) of andSection; 355.42 also requires that the countervailablebenefit must be provided with respect to the merchandise. Pursuant to andSection;355.2(k) of the current regulations, ``the merchandise'' means the classor kind of merchandise subject to the CVD proceeding. The purpose of thisrequirement is to make clear that under the Department's principles concerning``tying,'' which are set forth in section 355.47 of these proposed rules,no countervailable subsidy exists if benefits are tied to products otherthan the merchandise. We have used the somewhat redundant term ``countervailable subsidy'' deliberatelyin order to make clear the distinction between an actionable subsidy underthe Act and what a layperson might regard as a subsidy. 3. <T3>Section 355.43. </T3>This section sets forth the criteria for determiningthe existence of selective treatment under andSection; 355.42(a) of theseproposed rules. Paragraph (a) establishes criteria for determining whena program is considered to be an ``export'' program. Paragraph (b) thensets forth the criteria for determining when a ``domestic'' program is``specific'' within the meaning of the Act. The export/domestic distinction can have an important impact on the mannerin which a program is analyzed and any benefit valued. For example, pursuantto andSection; 355.44 of these proposed rules, the standards for determiningwhether a countervailable benefit exists may differ depending upon whetherthe benefit is provided pursuant to an export or a domestic program.In addition, the denominator used to calculate an <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate pursuant to andSection; 355.47 will differdepending upon whether the program in question is an export or a domesticprogram. Also, only export programs can trigger a finding of critical circumstancespursuant to section 703(e) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.16(a)(1), and underthe antidumping law, adjustments to United States price pursuant to section772(d)(1)(D) of the Act are made for export, but not domestic, subsidies.Paragraph (a)(1) of andSection; 355.43 restates the standard used by theDepartment over the years to distinguish export from domestic programs.See, <T3>e.g., Heavy Iron Construction Castings from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 9491(1986). The essential aspect of an export program is that a governmentprovides special benefits to exports or exporters above and beyond whatit may provide to nonexported products or nonexporters. Paragraph (a)(2) codifies existing practice with respect to programs withmultiple eligibility criteria. Frequently, for example, a government maymake ``impact on export earnings'' a criterion to be evaluated by governmentofficials in determining whether to provide benefits under a program orthe amount of benefits to be provided. In such situations, the Secretarymust evaluate all of the facts in order to determine whether the programoperates in such a way as to render it an export, as opposed to a domestic,program with respect to the merchandise. See, <T3>e.g., </T3><T3>Certain Carbon Steel Products from Austria,</T3> 50 FR 33369 (1985). Paragraph (b)(1) of andSection; 355.43 codifies the specificity test, thestatutory test consistently used by the Department to determine whetherselective treatment exists with respect to a domestic program. Under thistest, the Department deems a program to be specific if the program is limited,either <T3>de jure</T3> or <T3>de facto, </T3>to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries. Paragraph (b)(2) sets forth the general factors the Department will considerin applying the specificity test. As the Department has explained in variousdeterminations over the years, the specificity test cannot be reduced toa precise mathematical formula. Instead, the Department must exercise judgmentand balance various factors in analyzing the facts of a particular case.Paragraph (b)(2) lists, in a noninclusive manner, the factors that theDepartment typically will examine in determining whether a domestic programis, either on a <T3>de jure </T3>or <T3>de facto </T3>basis, specific. Under paragraph (b)(3), the Department will deem a program to be specificif it is limited to firms or industries located in specific regions ofa country. Paragraph (b)(4) codifies the Department's existing practice for determiningwhen the provision by a foreign government of infrastructure is consideredto be specific. This test was first fully articulated in <T3>Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Saudi Arabia, </T3>51 FR 4206 (1986), andhas been followed in a number of subsequent cases. See, <T3>e.g., Industrial Phosphoric Acid from Israel, </T3>52 FR 25447 (1987);<T3>Rice from Thailand, </T3>51 FR 12356 (1986); and <T3>Fresh Atlantic Groundfish from Canada, </T3>51 FR 10041 (1986). Inthis regard, the Department does not agree with the suggestion made in<T3>Cabot Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> 620 F. Supp. 722 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1985), <T3>appeal dismissed, </T3>788 F.2d 1539 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <T3>order vacated, </T3>(Ct. Int'l Trade, Nov. 20, 1986), that the provisionby a foreign government of infrastructure never can constitute a countervailablesubsidy. Paragraph (b)(4) restates the three-pronged test currently used by theDepartment. Where limitations on use do not result from government action,but instead result from the location and type of the infrastructure inquestion, specificity may not exist. As with the specificity test in general,the Department must apply the test set forth in paragraph (b)(4) on a case-by-casebasis in determining whether the provision of particular infrastructureis specific. Paragraph (b)(5) codifies the Department's practice concerning the specificitytest with respect to domestic programs of governments other than nationalgovernments of foreign countries. In such instances, the determinationof specificity depends upon the <T3>de jure </T3>and <T3>de facto </T3>availability of a program within the jurisdiction ofthe state, provincial, or local government in question. See, <T3>e.g., Iron Ore Pellets from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 21961 (1986); and <T3>Live Swine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork Products from Canada,</T3>50 FR 25097 (1985). It should be noted that although they are rare,export programs can exist at the state, provincial, or local governmentlevel. See, <T3>e.g., Certain Granite Products from Spain, </T3>53 FR 24340 (1988).In this regard, these proposed rules are not intended to change existingpractice with respect to programs funded by both the Federal and the State,provincial, or local government. In such instances, the Department wouldjudge the specificity of the federally funded portion of the program basedupon the availability and use of the program throughout the country inquestion as a whole. The Department would judge the specificity of theportion funded by the State, provincial, or local government based uponthe availability and use of the program within the jurisdiction of therelevant local government unit. See, <T3>e.g., Fresh Atlantic Groundfish from Canada. </T3>51 FR 10041 (1986),and <T3>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Canada. </T3>51 FR 15037 (1986), andthe discussions of GDA and ERDA agreements therein. In some cases, respondents have argued that in determining the specificityof a program ostensibly limited to a specific industry, the Departmentshould consider the existence of comparable programs providing similarbenefits to other industries. The Department's position has been to rejectsuch an analysis unless it finds that the programs are integrally linkedto one another. See, <T3>e.g., Fresh Atlantic Groundfish from Canada, </T3>50 FR 10041 (1986);and <T3>Fresh Cut Flowers from the Netherlands, </T3>52 FR 3301 (1987). Paragraph(b)(6) codifies this position. Paragraph (b)(7) codifies existing Department practice with respect toprograms limited solely to firms of a certain size. Under that practice,the fact that a program is limited to all small businesses, for example,does not necessarily result in a finding of specificity. See, <T3>e.g., Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Singapore. </T3>50 FR9840 (1985). However, a small business program may be deemed specific if,either on a <T3>de jure </T3>or <T3>de facto </T3>basis, benefits under the program are limited to certainsmall businesses. <T3>Cf., Iron-Metal Construction Castings from Mexico, </T3>50 FR 43262(1985).Paragraph (b)(8) codifies existing Department practice with respect toagricultural programs. Under that practice, a program that is limited tothe agricultural sector does not necessarily result in a finding of specificity.See, <T3>e.g., Fuel Ethanol from Brazil</T3>, 51 FR 3361 (1986); and <T3>Live Swine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork Products from Canada</T3>,50 FR 25097 (1985). However, an agricultural program may be deemed specificif, for example, benefits under the program are limited to, or provideddisproportionately to, producers of particular agricultural products. See,<T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>id</T3>. 4. <T3>Section 355.44</T3>. Section 355.44 sets forth the standards for determiningthe existence of a countervailable benefit with respect to particular typesof foreign government programs. As in the case of the Act itself, andSection;355.44 does not constitute an all-inclusive list of programs capable ofproviding a countervailable benefit. Instead, this section identifies thetypes of programs most frequently encountered by the Department and thestandards used with respect to each. The Department would deal with programsnot included in this section in accordance with the basic principles embodiedin the Act, these regulations, and administrative and judicial precedents.<T3>Paragraph (a)</T3>. Paragraph (a) of andSection; 355.44 codifies theDepartment's practice of treating the entire amount of a grant as a countervailablebenefit. We note here that although the Department treats the entire amountof a grant as a countervailable benefit, the allocation and valuation ofa grant depends upon the application of the rules set forth in  andSection;355.49of these proposed regulations. <T3>Paragraph (b).</T3> Paragraph (b) sets forth the standards for  determiningwhether a loan provided by a government confers a countervailable benefit.Paragraph (b), which deals primarily with the selection of the appropriatebenchmark interest rate, generally restates existing Department practiceas set forth in the Subsidies Appendix and numerous other Department precedents.See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Subsidies Appendix at 18018-20. Paragraph (b)(1) sets forth the general rule for all types of loans providedby a government; namely, that in determining the existence of a countervailablebenefit, the Department will compare what a firm pays for a governmentloan against what the firm would have paid for a benchmark loan. SubsidiesAppendix at 18018. Paragraph (b)(2) restates existing Department practice with respect tothe deferral of principal repayments and interest payments on loans providedby a government. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Subsidies Appendix at 18019. Essentially, unless a deferralis a normal or customary lending practice in the country in question, theSecretary will regard the deferral of principal or interest repaymentson a government loan as conferring a countervailable benefit, in additionto any benefit conferred by an interest rate below the benchmark interestrate, to the extent that the deferral results in a total loan repaymentthat is less than the repayment that would have occurred under the benchmarkloan. Paragraph (b)(3) describes the selection of a benchmark interest rate withrespect to short-term government loans. The first sentence of paragraph(b)(3)(i) restates the existing practice of using as a benchmark the averageinterest rate for the predominant alternative source of short-term financingin the country in question. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Subsidies Appendix at 18020; and <T3>Alhambra Foundry </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, 626 F. Supp. 402 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1985). The rationalefor using a ``country-wide'' benchmark was stated in the Subsidies Appendixas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">We believe the distinction between our treatment of short-term andlong-term loans is valid. Lending short-term generally is not as riskyas long-term, because of the shorter duration of the repayment obligationand the greater frequency of accompanying security (for example, accountsreceivable). Because there is little need for the lender to vary its termsto account for varying risk characteristics among companies, we would notexpect company-specific short-term loan terms to vary from national averageterms. Additionally, because of the enormous number of short-term loansinvolved in many cases, the use of company-specific benchmarks would significantlyimpair our ability to administer the countervailing duty law within theshort time limits established by the Act.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subsidies Appendix at 18020; <T3>see also</T3> <T3>Ceramic Tile from Mexico</T3>, 53 FR 15290 (1988). The Department is aware of contrary arguments in favor of using short-termbenchmarks based upon the borrowing experience of individual firms. Beforeissuing final rules, the Department will reevaluate its current practicein order to determine whether to provide for the use of company-specificshort-term benchmarks. The second sentence of paragraph (b)(3)(i) clarifies that in selectingan average benchmark interest rate, the Secretary will attempt to use asingle, predominant source of short-term financing in the country in question.The Department did not articulate this principle clearly in the SubsidiesAppendix, but has applied it in subsequent cases. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Roses and Other Cut Flowers from Colombia</T3>, 51 FR 44931 (1986);and <T3>Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Malaysia</T3>, 53 FR 13303 (1988). The rationalefor this approach is that, first, the purpose of the comparison is to determinewhat a firm's cost of money would be absent the allegedly countervailablegovernment loan. Where there is a predominant source of financing, thissource provides the most likely indication of what the firm's alternativecosts would be. Second, the use of a single source provides administrativesavings to the Department and greater predictability to the parties involvedin a CVD proceeding. Occasionally, there will not be a single, predominant source of short-termfinancing in a country. Therefore, the third sentence of paragraph (b)(3)(i)provides that in such instances the Secretary may construct a compositebenchmark interest rate from two or more alternative sources of short-termfinancing. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Non-Rubber Footwear from Argentina</T3>, 51 FR 28613 (1986); <T3>Certain Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Colombia</T3>, 52 FR13272 (1987). The rationale for this approach is that where there is nosingle, predominant source of short-term financing, a firm would meet itsshort-term debt needs by borrowing from one or more of these alternativesources. Thus, the best alternative measure of what a firm's cost for short-termdebt would be absent the allegedly subsidized government loan is an averageof what the costs would be if the firm used the alternative sources.Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) clarifies what the Department considers to be a ``predominant''source of short-term financing. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a source offinancing is predominant if it is greater than or equal to 50 percent ofthe total short-term financing, in local currency, in the relevant country.Paragraph (b)(3)(iii) codifies the period for which the Department willcalculate a short-term loan benchmark. Unless short-term interest rateshave fluctuated significantly during the year in question, the Departmentwill calculate a single, annual average benchmark interest rate. Paragraph (b)(4) sets forth, in order of preference, the benchmarks usedwith respect to long-term, fixed-rate government loans. Paragraph (b)(5)sets forth a comparable list of benchmarks used with respect to long-term,variable-rate government loans. As under existing practice, paragraphs(b) (4) and (5) contain a preference for company-specific benchmarks, becausesuch benchmarks enable the Department ``to capture the fact that certaincompanies are more (or less) risky than average, and that commercial lenderswill take these risk characteristics into account in setting the conditionsof the loan.'' Subsidies Appendix at 18018-19. However, because company-specificbenchmarks are not always available, paragraphs (b) (4) and (5) includea list of alternative benchmarks: national average long-term benchmarksor a short-term benchmark. In the past, where company-specific long-termbenchmarks have not been available, the Department has attempted to uselong-term financing received by a different firm in the same industry beforegoing to a national average benchmark. The Department has found that anyadditional accuracy gained through the use of an ``industry'' benchmarkis outweighed by the administrative burden involved in identifying suchbenchmarks. Therefore, paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) do not provide forthe use of industry benchmarks. Paragraph (b)(6) restates existing Department practice with respect toloans to uncreditworthy firms. In the case of uncreditworthy firms, theDepartment assumes that a private lender would require a premium interestrate, and the rule set forth in paragraph (b)(6) is designed to take thisinto account. Thus, the Department calculates a different benchmark forlong-term loans to uncreditworthy firms. Paragraph (b)(6)(i) describes the standard for determining whether a firmis uncreditworthy. Because these determinations are ``often highly complex,''Subsidies Appendix at 18019, paragraph (b)(6)(i) does not set forth a hard-and-fastrule, but merely describes certain factors that the Secretary may examinein determining the creditworthiness of a firm. It must be emphasized thatthis list of factors is not intended to be an exhaustive list. As underexisting practice, the existence of private long-term loans, provided withoutan explicit government guarantee, normally would be a dispositive indicatorthat a firm was creditworthy. Paragraph (b)(6)(ii) codifies current Department practice to the effectthat the Department normally will not investigate the creditworthinessof a firm absent a specific allegation by petitioner, supported by documentationthat demonstrates that the firm is uncreditworthy. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Fuel Ethanol from Brazil</T3>, 51 FR 3361 (1986). The reason for thisrequirement is that the investigation and analysis of creditworthinessadds substantially to the work involved in a CVD investigation or review.Therefore, prior to incurring this burden, it is reasonable to requirea petitioner to provide particular evidence establishing a reasonable basisto believe or suspect that the firm in question is uncreditworthy. Generally,where the Secretary previously has found a firm to be uncreditworthy andthere has been no intervening finding of creditworthiness, the prior findingshall constitute a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the firmcontinues to be uncreditworthy. Paragraph (b)(6)(iii) codifies existing Department practice with respectto the effect of subsidies on the creditworthiness of a firm. In the past,it has been argued that in assessing creditworthiness the Department shouldsubtract subsidies received by a firm from the firm's financial data. Inthe Department's opinion, this approach results in the use of a standarddifferent from that used by a private lender, who will look to the financialposition of the firm at the time of the loan. In addition, this approachtakes into account the secondary effects of subsidies, a highly speculativeexercise which the Department has avoided in other contexts and which isnot required by the statute. See Subsidies Appendix at 18023. Therefore,paragraph (b)(6)(iii) provides that the Secretary will ignore subsidiesin making creditworthiness determinations. Paragraph (b)(6)(iv) describes the benchmark the Secretary will use inthe case of a government long-term loan to a firm deemed to be uncreditworthyunder paragraph (b)(6)(i). Paragraph (b)(6)(iv) codifies the current ``riskpremium'' used by the Department with respect to such loans. See SubsidiesAppendix at 18019-20. Paragraph (b)(6)(v) codifies existing practice concerning government short-termfinancing to uncreditworthy firms. Under the regulation, the creditworthinessof a firm would be irrelevant with respect to short-term financing ``[b]ecauseof the low level or risk associated with short-term debt, and the frequentexistence of security.'' Subsidies Appendix at 18020. Paragraph (b)(7) restates the current principle that in selecting a benchmarkfor comparison purposes, the Secretary will attempt to use, where possible,a nongovernment source of financing. However, where necessary, the Secretarymay use financing made available under one or more government programs,provided that any such government program is not deemed to be selectivewithin the meaning of section 355.43; <T3>e.g</T3>., the government program is not limited to exporters or toa specific industry. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Certain Apparel from Argentina</T3>, 52 FR 26053 (1987); <T3>Certain Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Colombia</T3>, 52 FR13272 (1987); and <T3>Fuel Ethanol from Brazil</T3>, 51 FR 3361 (1986). This principle recognizesthat in some countries with less developed financial markets, the governmentmay take a more active role in making funds available to the economy. Insuch instances, it is appropriate to use as a benchmark financing providedor directed by the government, so long as such financing itself does notconstitute a countervailable subsidy.Paragraph (b)(8) restates the existing preference for comparing two effectiveinterest rates where the Secretary can quantify any charges added on tonominal interest rates. See, <T3>e.g., Bricks from Mexico, </T3>53 FR 15264 (1988); and <T3>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina, </T3>51 FR 41649 (1986).A comparison of effective interest rates provides the most accurate measureof the existence and extent of any countervailable benefit conferred bymeans of government financing. However, consistent with existing practice,paragraph (b)(8) also provides that where the Secretary cannot quantifyany charges added on to nominal interest rates, either with respect tothe government financing or the benchmark financing, the Secretary willcompare nominal interest rates. See, <T3>e.g., Certain Apparel from Argentina, </T3>52 FR 26053 (1987); and<T3>Iron-Metal Castings from India, </T3>51 FR 45789 (1986). It would beless accurate to compare a nominal interest rate with an effective interestrate. Therefore, paragraph (b)(8) provides that the Secretary will makesuch a comparison only as a last resort; <T3>e.g., </T3>where there is no information permitting an effective-to-effectiveor nominal-to-nominal comparison. Of course, although not expressly statedin paragraph (b)(8), in some situations the nominal interest rate may bethe same as the effective interest rate. See, <T3>e.g., Castor Oil Products from Brazil, </T3>52 FR 18726 (1987); and<T3>Fabricated Automotive Glass from Mexico, </T3>50 FR 1906 (1985). Paragraph (b)(9) clarifies the standard for investigating the lending activityof government-owned banks. In some countries, banks may be owned, in wholeor in part, by the government. Despite government ownership, however, thebanks function as commercial enterprises. In such instances, it is notwarranted or feasible for the Department to routinely investigate all loansprovided by government-owned banks. Therefore, paragraph (b)(9) providesthat government ownership alone shall not be sufficient to trigger an investigationof a bank's lending activity, and that there must be some allegation that(i) a bank provided a loan at the direction of the government or with fundsprovided by the government, and (ii) the loan was provided on terms inconsistentwith commercial considerations. See, <T3>e.g., </T3><T3>Granite Products from Italy, </T3>53 FR 27197 (1988). <T3>Paragraph (c). </T3>Paragraph (c) clarifies the standard for determiningwhen a government guarantee of a loan constitutes a countervailable benefit.Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1), an explicit guarantee by a government ofa loan constitutes a countervailable benefit to the extent that: (i) Theprice or fee paid by a firm to a government for the guarantee is less thanthe price the firm would have paid for a comparable commercial loan guarantee(<T3>see, e.g., Fresh Cut Flowers from the Netherlands, </T3>52 FR 3301(1987) and <T3>Live Swine from Canada, </T3>50 FR 25097 (1985)); or (ii) the amountpaid by the firm for the guaranteed loan is less than what it would havepaid for a benchmark loan (<T3>cf., Certain Carbon Steel Products from Brazil, </T3>49 FR 17988 (1984);and Subsidies Appendix at 18019). As under current practice, the Departmentwould not regard a so-called ``implicit'' loan guarantee by a governmentas giving rise to a countervailable benefit. See, <T3>e.g., Certain Carbon Steel Products from Austria, </T3>50 FR 33369(1985). Paragraph (c)(2) codifies current practice by providing that where a governmentis a principal owner or shareholder of a firm, the Department will notregard an explicit loan guarantee by the government as a countervailablebenefit if it is the normal commercial practice in the country in questionfor owners or shareholders to provide comparable loan guarantees for theirfirms. See, <T3>e.g., Certain Carbon Steel Products from Venezuela, </T3>50 FR 11227(1985); and <T3>Carbon Stee1 Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago, </T3>49 FR 480 (1984).<T3>Paragraph (d). </T3>Paragraph (d) sets forth the Department's standardfor determining whether a government export insurance program providesa countervailable benefit. Paragraph (d)(1) defines the general rule asreflected by existing Department practice: that premium rates charged mustnot be manifestly inadequate to cover operating expenses and losses. See,<T3>e.g., Fresh Cut Flowers from Israel, </T3>52 FR 3316 (1987); and <T3>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Israel, </T3>52 FR 1649 (1987). Thisstandard corresponds to item (j) of the Illustrative List, and a petitionermust allege that rates are manifestly inadequate to cover operating expensesand losses before the Department will investigate an export insurance program.<T3>Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Singapore, </T3>50 FR 36130 (1985). Thesecond sentence of paragraph (d)(1) makes clear that the Department willanalyze both the viability of the particular insurance program in questionand the overall commercial health of the entity operating the program.As under current practice, in examining whether rates are manifestly inadequate,the Department will examine a five-year period, up to and including theyear in question. <T3>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Israel, </T3>52 FR 1649 (1987). TheDepartment also will determine the aspect of the program used, <T3>Brass Sheet and Strip from France, </T3>52 FR 1222 (1987), and willexamine the annual reports and other books of the entity providing theinsurance. <T3>Id. </T3>Paragraph (d)(2) prescribes the method of valuing the benefit if the Secretaryfinds that premiums charged are manifestly inadequate. Under paragraph(d)(2), the Department will calculate the excess of the amount receivedby a firm over the amount of premiums paid by the firm, and this excess,if any, shall constitute the countervailable benefit. <T3>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Israel, </T3>52 FR 1649 (1987).<T3>Paragraph (e). </T3>Paragraph (e) codifies existing practice in determiningwhen a foreign government's provision of equity to a firm confers a countervailablebenefit. Under paragraph (e)(1), the preferred standard, an equity infusionconfers a countervailable benefit when the market-determined price forequity purchased directly from the firm is less than the price paid bythe foreign government for the same form of equity purchased directly fromthe firm. See, <T3>e.g., Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina,</T3>49 FR 18006 (1984). In this regard, in an exceptional situation theDepartment could find the volume of a firm's traded shares to be so lowas to preclude the use of these shares as a ``market-determined price.''<T3>Cf., Certain Steel Products from France, </T3>47 FR 39332 (1982). Also,as under current practice, the government purchase of previously issuedshares on a market or directly from shareholders rather than from the firmwould not constitute a countervailable benefit to the firm that issuedthe shares. See, <T3>e.g., </T3>Appendix 2, <T3>Certain Steel Products from Belgium, </T3>47 FR 39316 (1982) (``Appendix2''); <T3>Potassium Chloride from Spain, </T3>49 FR 36424 (1984); and <T3>Iron Ore Pellets from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 21961 (1986). If there is no market-determined price for a firm's shares (<T3>e.g., </T3>the firm's shares are not publicly traded), paragraph (e)(1)(ii)provides that a government equity infusion constitutes a countervailablebenefit if the firm was not equityworthy (<T3>i.e., </T3>from the standpoint of a reasonable private investor, thefirm was not a reasonable investment) and there is a rate of return shortfallwithin the meaning of andSection; 355.49(e). Paragraph (e)(2) sets forththe basic criteria the Secretary will use in determining whether a firmis or is not equityworthy. The principal criterion is whether a reasonableprivate investor could expect from the firm a reasonable rate of returnwithin a reasonable period of time. Subsidies Appendix at 18020. Factorsthat the Secretary may use to determine whether a firm can generate a reasonablerate of return include: (1) current and past indicators of a firm's financialhealth (<T3>e.g., </T3>current ratio, cash flow, debt-equity ratio), adjusted forgenerally accepted accounting principles where appropriate, <T3>see, e.g., </T3><T3>Structural Shapes and Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Productsfrom Korea, </T3>49 FR 47284 (1984); <T3>Certain Steel Products from South Africa, </T3>49 FR 32426 (1984));(2) future financial prospects, <T3>see, e.g., Certain Carbon Steel Products from Brazil, </T3>52 FR 829(1987); <T3>Stainless Steel Plate from the United Kingdom, </T3>51 FR 44656 (1986);(3) recent rate of return on equity, <T3>see, e.g., Certain Carbon Steel Products from Brazil, </T3>49 FR 17988(1984); and (4) participation by private investors, <T3>compare, Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago, </T3>49 FR480 (1984), <T3>with Fresh Atlantic Groundfish from Canada, </T3>51 FR 10041 (1986).In this regard, the Department intends to continue its practice of assessingthe firm as a whole, rather than a particular product line, because a privateinvestor would consider the firm as a whole in making an investment decision.See, <T3>e.g., Fuel Ethanol from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 3361 (1986). Paragraph (e)(3) codifies current Department practice to the effect thatthe Department will not investigate equity infusions in a firm absent aspecific allegation by petitioner, supported  by information reasonablyavailable to petitioner, that: (1) The government actually has made anequity infusion in the firm; and (2) under one of the standards set forthin paragraph (e)(1), that infusion conferred a countervailable benefit.See, <T3>e.g., Iron Ore Pellets from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 21961 (1986); and <T3>Textile Mill Products from Mexico, </T3>50 FR 10824 (1985). The reasonfor this requirement is that investigations of equity infusions, like investigationsof creditworthiness, add substantially to the work involved in a CVD investigationor review. Therefore, it is reasonable to require a petitioner to provideparticular evidence of a countervailable equity infusion, as opposed tomerely alleging that a government owns a firm in whole or in part. Paragraph (e)(4) codifies existing Department practice with respect tothe effect of subsidies on the equityworthiness of a firm. In the past,it has been argued that in assessing equityworthiness the Department shouldsubtract subsidies received by a firm from the firm's financial data. Inthe Department's opinion, this approach results in the use of a standarddifferent from that used by a private investor, who will look to the financialposition of the firm at the time of the investment. In addition, this approachtakes into account the secondary effects of subsidies, a highly speculativeexercise which the Department has avoided in other contexts and which isnot required by the statute. See Subsidies Appendix at 18023. <T3>Paragraph (f). </T3>Paragraph (f) of section 355.44 sets forth thestandard for determining when the provision by a government of a good orservice confers a countervailable benefit within the meaning of section771(5)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act. Paragraph (f)(1) codifies the basic principleof existing Department practice, first articulated in <T3>Certain Softwood Products from Canada, </T3>48 FR 24159, 24167 (1983),that the standard of ``preferential,'' within the meaning of section 771(5)(A)(ii)(II),means more favorable treatment to some within the relevant jurisdictionthan to others within that jurisdiction; it does not mean ``inconsistentwith commercial considerations.'' Paragraph (f)(1) adheres to this standardby providing that in determining whether the government provision of agood or service confers a countervailable benefit, the Secretary will comparethe government price under scrutiny to a benchmark price, which normallywill be the prices the government charges to the same or other users ofthe good or service within the same political jurisdiction. In <T3>Softwood Products, </T3>however, the Department also recognized thatin some cases, the number of users of a government-provided good or servicemight be so limited as to require the use of a different benchmark. <T3>Id., </T3>note I. The Department faced this situation in its section751 administrative review of the CVD order on <T3>Carbon Black from Mexico. </T3>In that case, the government-providedgood in question was carbon black feedstock (``CBFS''), for which therewere only two users in Mexico. The Department determined that given thelimited number of users of CBFS, its standard test for determining ``preferentiality''would not work. 51 FR 13269, 13271 (1986). Therefore, the Department consideredalternative benchmarks, and issued a so-called ``Preferentiality Appendix''describing these alternatives and requesting public comments. <T3>Id. </T3>at 13272. These alternatives were, in order of preference:(1) Prices charged by the same seller for a similar or related good orservice; (2) prices charged within the jurisdiction by other sellers foran identical good or service; (3) the same seller's cost of producing thegood or service; and (4) external prices. In <T3>Carbon Black, </T3>the Department used the first alternative.Paragraph (f)(2) codifies the alternative benchmarks set forth in the PreferentialityAppendix. Thus, paragraph (f)(2) provides that where there is no nonselectivebenchmark price (<T3>e.g., </T3>the normal benchmark either does not exist or is limitedto a specific enterprise or industry or group thereof), the Secretary willuse, in order of preference, the following benchmarks: (i) The price, adjustedfor any cost differences, the government charges for a good or servicewhich is similar or related to the good or service in question, providedthat the similar or related good or service and its price is not selective;(ii) the price charged by other sellers to buyers within the same politicaljurisdiction for an identical good or service; (iii) the government's costof providing the good or service; or (iv) the price paid for the identicalgood or service outside of the political jurisdiction in question. Thereasons for selecting these alternatives and their ranking are set forthin the Preferentiality Appendix. The Department is aware, however, of arguments in favor of a differentranking of the alternative benchmarks set forth in the PreferentialityAppendix. Therefore, before issuing final rules, the Department will reevaluatethese alternatives and will consider carefully any comments concerningthe selection of alternative benchmarks for determining the preferentialityof a good or service provided by a government. <T3>Paragraph (g). </T3>Paragraph (g) of section 355.44, which correspondsto item (c) of the Illustrative List, codifies the Department's practicewith respect to preferential transport or freight charges for export shipments.Paragraph (g)(1) restates the general rule that a countervailable benefitexists to the extent that a firm pays less for the transport of goods destinedfor export than it would for the transport of goods destined for domesticconsumption. See, <T3>e.g., Ferrochrome from South Africa, </T3>46 FR 21155 (1981); and <T3>Carbon Steel Plates and High Strength Steel Plates from Mexico, </T3>41FR 1273 (1976). Where a firm pays the same basic charges regardless ofwhether a product is destined for export or for domestic consumption, acountervailable benefit does not exist under this paragraph, <T3>Low-Fuming Brazing Copper Rod and Wire from South Africa, </T3>50 FR31642 (1985), although a countervailable benefit still might exist underandSection; 355.44(f). Paragraph (g)(2) provides illustrative examples of situations in whicha countervailable benefit does not exist: (i) Where the difference in chargesis the result of an arm's length transaction between the supplier and theuser of the transport or freight services, <T3>see, e.g., Miniature Carnations from Colombia, </T3>52 FR 32033 (1987);<T3>Roses and Other Cut Flowers from Colombia, </T3>47 FR 2158 (1983);<T3>Steel Wire Rope from South Africa, </T3>47 FR 40203 (1982); and <T3>Lamb Meat from New Zealand, </T3>46 FR 58128 (1981); or (ii) wherethe difference in charges is commercially justified, <T3>see, </T3><T3>e.g., Certain Steel Products from South Africa, </T3>47 FR 39379 (1982).In these situations, the government is not treating the firm paying thecharges any differently than the market would treat the firm. <T3>Paragraph (h). </T3>Paragraph (h), which corresponds to item (d) ofthe Illustrative List, deals with the government provision of goods pursuantto an export program. <T3>Paragraph (i). </T3>Paragraph (i) of andSection; 355.44 codifies existingDepartment practice with respect to programs providing tax or import chargebenefits. The Department has encountered various types of these programs,and the various paragraphs of paragraph (i) describe the standards fordetermining the existence of a countervailable benefit with respect toeach type. Paragraph (i)(1), which deals with direct tax benefits, defines a countervailablebenefit as the full or partial exemption, remission, or deferral of a directtax or social welfare charge in excess of the tax which a firm otherwisewould pay absent a government program. This paragraph also defines a countervailablebenefit as a reduction in the base used to calculate a direct tax or socialwelfare charge in excess of the tax which a firm otherwise would pay absenta government program. Paragraph (i)(1), although it is not limited to exportprograms, corresponds to the export subsidies described in items (e) and(f) of the Illustrative List. See also Annex I, paragraph (4), to Part355 of our current regulations and the following cases for examples ofcountervailable benefits under the proposed regulation: <T3>Offshore Platform Jackets and Piles from Korea, </T3>51 FR 11779 (1986);<T3>Low-Fuming Brazing Copper Rod and Wire from New Zealand, </T3>50 FR31638 (1985); <T3>Textile Mill Products and Apparel from the Philippines, </T3>50 FR1607 (1985); <T3>Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Argentina, </T3>50 FR 9846 (1985);<T3>Pads for Woodwind Instrument Keys from Italy, </T3>49 FR 17793 (1984);and <T3>Refrigeration Compressors from Singapore, </T3>48 FR 39109 (1983).As under existing practice, in determining the taxes a firm ``otherwisewould have paid,'' the Department will take account of the effects on afirm's total tax liability as a result of a firm's use of a tax subsidy.See, <T3>e.g., Lamb Meat from New Zealand, </T3>53 FR 47 (1988), and the discussionof the calculation of EMDTI benefits. Paragraph (i)(2) deals with domestic programs providing indirect tax andimport charge benefits. Pursuant to paragraph (i)(2), a program confersa countervailable benefit to the extent that it relieves a firm of indirecttaxes or import charges that it otherwise would pay absent the program.Paragraph (i)(3), which corresponds to item (g) of the Illustrative List,deals with export programs providing benefits with respect to final stageindirect taxes. Paragraph (i)(3) restates the existing rule that the nonexcessiveexemption or remission of final stage indirect taxes does not confer acountervailable benefit. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Zenith Radio Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, <T3>supra</T3>. Paragraph (i)(4)(i), which corresponds to items (h) and (i) of the IllustrativeList, deals with export programs providing indirect tax and/or import chargebenefits. Paragraph (i)(4)(i) restates the existing rule that the nonexcessiveexemption, remission, or deferral of prior stage cumulative indirect taxesand/or import charges levied on goods that are physically incorporatedinto the exported product does not confer a countervailable benefit. Inthis regard, paragraph (i)(4)(i) also codifies existing principles withrespect to physical incorporation. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Annex I, paragraph (1), to Part 355 of our current regulations.Where the amount exempted or rebated is excessive, the excessive amountconstitutes the countervailable benefit. However, under paragraph (i)(4)(ii),which codifies the Department's existing linkage test for these types oftax and duty rebate programs, <T3>see, </T3><T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Industrial Fasteners Group, American Importers Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, 710 F.2d 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the entire amountof the rebate would constitute a countervailable benefit if the Secretarydetermined that the criteria of paragraph (i)(4)(ii) were not satisfied.See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Certain Apparel from Thailand</T3>, 50 FR 9818 (1985); and <T3>Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Indonesia</T3>, 49 FR 49672(1984). <T3>Paragraph (j)</T3>. Paragraph (j) codifies existing practice with respectto foreign government programs that provide assistance to workers. Underexisting practice, such assistance generally constitutes a countervailablebenefit only to the extent that it relieves a firm of an obligation itotherwise normally would incur. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Appendix 2. Benefits which accrue only to workers do notconstitute countervailable benefits. <T3>Compare </T3>Appendix 3, <T3>Certain Steel Products from Belgium</T3>, 47 FR 39304 (1982) (ECSChousing assistance); and <T3>Certain Carbon Steel Products from Austria</T3>, 50 FR 33369 (1985),<T3>with Certain Carbon Steel Products from Sweden</T3>, 50 FR 33375 (1985);and <T3>Certain Steel Products from the United Kingdom</T3>, 47 FR 39384 (1982)(ISITB training programs). <T3>Paragraph (k)</T3>. Paragraph (k) codifies existing practice concerninggovernment assumption or forgiveness of a firm's debt. Thus, the firstsentence of paragraph (k) provides that the assumption or forgiveness ofa firm's outstanding debt provides a countervailable benefit equal to theoutstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest at the time of the assumptionor forgiveness. See Subsidies Appendix at 18020. Essentially, the Departmentwill treat the assumption or forgiveness as if it were a grant within themeaning of andSection; 355.44(a), and will value this ``grant'' in accordancewith the principles of andSection; 355.49. The second sentence of paragraph(k) provides that if the foreign government receives shares in a firm inreturn for assuming or forgiving all or part of a firm's outstanding debt,the government action shall be treated as an equity infusion in accordancewith the standards of andSection; 355.44(e). Subsidies Appendix at 18020.<T3>Paragraph (l)</T3>. Paragraph (l) codifies existing Department practicewith respect to assistance provided for purposes of research and development.Under that practice, such assistance does not confer a countervailablebenefit where the results of the research and development are made availableto the public, including the U.S. competitors of the recipient of the assistance.See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Appendix 2; <T3>Roses from Israel</T3>, 52 FR 3316 (1987); <T3>Fuel Ethanol from Brazil</T3>, 51 FR 3361 (1986); and <T3>Certain Carbon Steel Products from Sweden</T3>, 50 FR 33375 (1985).Although this practice was called into question in <T3>Agrexco, Agricultural Export Co., Ltd. </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, 604 F. Supp. 1238 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1985), the Departmentdisagrees with that aspect of the decision, and, in any event, the decisionhas become moot due to the completion of subsequent administrative reviewsof the CVD order in question. It should be noted that a program providing assistance for research anddevelopment still must be selective, within the meaning of andSection; 355.43,in order to constitute a countervailable subsidy. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Appendix 2; <T3>Fuel Ethanol from Brazil</T3>, 51 FR 3361 (1906); and <T3>Lamb Meat from New Zealand</T3>, 50 FR 37708 (1985). It also shouldbe noted that if paragraph (1) does not apply to a program (<T3>e.g</T3>., the results of the research are not publicly available),the Department would deal with any benefits provided under the programpursuant to one of the other paragraphs of andSection; 355.44. For example,the Department would handle grants for research and development under andSection;355.44(a), loans under andSection; 355.44(b), etc. <T3>Paragraph (m)</T3>. Paragraph (m) codifies existing Department practicewith respect to certain types of export promotion activities. Most countries,including the United States, maintain general export promotion programs.As long as these programs provide only general informational services,they do not constitute a countervailable benefit. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Certain Textile and Textile Products from Mexico</T3>, 44 FR 41003(1979); <T3>Cotton Sheeting and Sateen from Peru</T3>, 48 FR 4501 (1983); and <T3>Fresh Cut Flowers from Mexico</T3>, 49 FR 15007 (1984). Thus, underparagraph (m), an export program limited to these sorts of general activitieswould not constitute a countervailable benefit, notwithstanding any otherprovision of andSection; 355.44. However, if, for example, such activitiespromoted a specific product, <T3>Fresh Atlantic Groundfish from Canada</T3>, 51 FR 10041 (1986), orprovided financial assistance to a firm, <T3>see</T3>, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Fresh Cut Flowers from Israel</T3>, 52 FR 3316 (1987), these activitieswould not fall within the purview of paragraph (m), and could constitutea countervailable benefit under one of the other provisions of andSection;355.44.<T3>Paraqraph (n). </T3>Paragraph (n) codifies existing Department practicewith respect to programs providing varying levels of benefits based upondiffering eligibility criteria (sometimes referred to as ``tiered programs'').Under existing practice, where certain benefits under a program are selectiveand others are nonselective, the Department determines the existence ofa countervailable benefit by comparing the benefits received by a firmto the benefits it would have received under the most favorable, nonselectiveportion of the program in question. For example, in many CVD proceedingsinvolving merchandise from Canada, the Department has dealt with the Canadianinvestment tax credit. Under Canadian tax law, the basic seven percenttax credit is so widely available and used in Canada that the Departmenthas found it to be nonselective. Other, more favorable tax credits areavailable on a selective basis, however. In determining the countervailablebenefit arising from the use of these selective tax credits, the Departmentcompares a firm's tax savings arising from the use of these selective taxcredits with what the firm's taxes would have been had it used only theseven percent tax credit. See, <T3>e.g., Oil Country Tubular Goods from Canada, </T3>51 FR 15037 (1986);<T3>see also, e.g., Iron-Metal Construction Castings from Mexico, </T3>50FR 43262 (1985) (FOGAIN); <T3>Certain Apparel from Thailand, </T3>50 FR 9818 (1985); and <T3>Textile Mill Products and Apparel from the Philippines, </T3>50 FR1607 (1985). Paragraph (n) supersedes any other provision of section 355.44 with respectto the selection of the benchmark used to determine the existence of acountervailable benefit. However, in order for paragraph (n) to apply,the Secretary must determine that a firm would have been eligible for nonselectivebenefits under a program. <T3>Paragraph (o). </T3>Paragraph (o)(1) codifies current practice withrespect to so-called ``transnational benefits.'' Occasionally, the Departmenthas encountered programs which are funded through foreign aid, either ona bilateral or multilateral basis. In such instances, the Department (andTreasury before it) has determined such programs to be noncountervailable,to the extent that funds for the program are not provided by the governmentof the country in question. See, <T3>e.g., Viscose Rayon Staple Fiber from Austria, </T3>45 FR 1468 (1980)(U.S. Marshall Plan); <T3>Textiles and Textile Products from Pakistan, </T3>44 FR 2746 (1979)(Bilateral and multilateral aid); <T3>Pig Iron from Brazil, </T3>48 FR 54091 (1983) (U.S. aid through Alliancefor Progress); <T3>Certain Steel Products from Korea, </T3>47 FR 57535 (1982) (War reparationspaid by the Government of Japan to the Government of Korea); and <T3>Textiles and Textile Products from Turkey, </T3>49 FR 32639 (1984)(World Bank). However, to the extent that the government of a country supplementssuch funding with its own funds, the latter funds could provide a countervailablebenefit. <T3>Fuel Ethanol from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 3361 (1986). Paragraph (o)(2) codifies section 701(d) of the Act, as added by section1315 of the 1988 Act. Paragraph (o)(2) contains an exception to the generalrule of paragraph (o)(1) for situations involving the production of merchandiseby an international consortium, the members of which receive countervailablesubsidies from their respective home governments. 5. <T3>Section 355.45. </T3>Section 355.45 codifies existing Department practicewith respect to upstream subsidies. The most complete descriptions of theDepartment's current practice are in the preliminary and final determinationsin <T3>Certain Agricultural Tillage Tools from Brazil, </T3>50 FR 24270 (1985),50 FR 34525 (1985), respectively, and in <T3>Fuel Ethanol from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 3361 (1986). Paragraph (a) sets forth the general rule. In order to find an upstreamsubsidy under section 771A of the Act, three elements must exist. First,the input product must benefit from a ``domestic,'' as opposed to an ``export,''countervailable subsidy. Second, the countervailable subsidy on the inputproduct must bestow a competitive benefit on the merchandise. Third, thecountervailable subsidy on the input product must have a significant effecton the cost of manufacturing or producing the merchandise. Paragraph (b) sets forth the threshold elements that must be alleged beforethe Secretary will investigate an upstream subsidy allegation. These elementsform the ``reasonable basis to believe or suspect'' standard containedin section 703(g) of the Act, a standard which is higher than the standardfor initiating a CVD investigation. This threshold applies to an allegationcontained in a petition (<T3>see </T3>19 CFR 355.12(b)(8)), as well as an allegation made at a laterstage of a proceeding. Paragraph (c) defines ``input product.'' It should be noted here that agriculturalinputs are dealt with in paragraph (g), which incorporates the standardsof section 771B of the Act, as added by the 1988 Act. Paragraph (d) sets forth the standard for determining whether a ``competitivebenefit'' exists, codifying the hierarchy of benchmarks set forth in <T3>Agricultural Tillage Tools from Brazil, </T3>50 FR 24270 (1985). Thepreferred benchmark is the price charged by unsubsidized producers of theinput product located in the same country as the producer of the merchandise.If there are no unsubsidized producers, but in a prior CVD proceeding theSecretary has determined that a domestic countervailable subsidy is bestowedon the input product, the Secretary could derive a benchmark by adjustingfor the effects of the subsidy on the input. Alternatively, the Secretarycould use a world market price for the input product. Paragraph (e) establishes the standard for determining whether a ``significanteffect'' on cost exists. Paragraph (e) codifies the standard used in thefinal determination in <T3>Agricultural Tillage Tools from Brazil, </T3>50 FR 34525 (1985). Whileparagraph (e) sets forth certain presumptions based upon the ratio whichthe <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate on the input bears to the total productioncosts of the merchandise, this presumption is rebuttable through the presentationof particular evidence. Ultimately, the analysis involves a case-by-casedetermination of the degree to which demand for the merchandise is elastic.The more fungible the merchandise (<T3>i.e., </T3>the more that it competes on the basis of price, ratherthan on quality or other non-price factors), the more likely is it thatthe countervailable subsidy on the input product will have a ``significant''effect on cost. Paragraph (f) provides that where the Secretary determines that an upstreamsubsidy exists, the Secretary will include an amount equal to the amountof competitive benefit in the subsidy rate for the merchandise. Paragraph (g), which deals with processed agricultural products, codifiessection 771B of the Act, as added by section 1313 of the 1988 Act. Essentially,if the criteria of paragraph (g) are satisfied, the Secretary will notapply an upstream subsidy analysis with respect to subsidies on raw agriculturalproducts used in the production of processed agricultural products. Instead,the Secretary will deem subsidies on the raw product to be provided withrespect to the processed product. 6. <T3>Section 355.46. </T3>Section 355.46 codifies the provisions of section771(6) of the Act concerning offsets. Paragraph (a) reiterates the provisionsof section 771(6). As under existing practice, the Department will construenarrowly the provisions of paragraph (a).Paragraph (b) is intended to codify the current practice of ignoring thesecondary tax consequences of a countervailable benefit. For example, someforeign governments may treat cash grants as revenue for income tax purposes.Under paragraph (b), the Department would ignore the fact that such grantsmay be subject to taxation. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Welded Carbon Steel Pipe and Tube from Argentina</T3>, 53 FR 37619(1988). 7. <T3>Section 355.47</T3>. Section 355.47 deals with the allocation of benefitsto particular products or markets and the calculation of <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rates. In Departmental parlance, these mattersfall under the rubric of ``tying'' and ``denominators.'' <T3>Paragraph (a)</T3>. Paragraph (a) of andSection; 355.47 codifies existingpractice with respect to tied benefits (<T3>e.g</T3>., a benefit bestowed specifically to promote the productionof a particular product). The first sentence of paragraph (a) restatesexisting practice to the effect that where the Secretary determines thata benefit is tied to the production or sale of a particular product (orproducts), the Secretary will allocate the benefit fully to the product(or products). See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Appendix 2. The second sentence of paragraph (a) restatesa corollary principle that if the product (or products) to which the benefitis tied is a product other than the merchandise under investigation orreview (see andSection; 355.2(k) of the current regulations for the definitionof ``the merchandise''), no countervailable subsidy exists. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., Appendix 2; and <T3>Industrial Nitrocellulose from France</T3>, 52 FR 833 (1987). The third sentence of paragraph (a) then describes the method for calculatingthe <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate where a benefit is tied to products includedwithin ``the merchandise.'' Paragraph (a)(1) provides that in the caseof a domestic program, the Secretary will calculate the <T3>ad valorem </T3>rate by dividing the benefit received by a firm bythe firm's total sales of the product (or products) to which the benefitis tied. Paragraph (a)(2) provides that in the case of an export program,the Secretary will calculate the <T3>ad valorem </T3>rate by dividing the benefit received by a firm bythe firm's total exports of the product (or products) to which the benefitis tied. <T3>Paragraph (b)</T3>. Paragraph (b) of section 355.47 codifies existingDepartment practice with respect to benefits tied to sales to a particularmarket. The first sentence of paragraph (b) sets forth the general rulethat where a benefit is tied to sales to a particular market, the Secretarywill allocate the benefit fully to products sold in that market. The secondsentence of paragraph (b) provides the corollary rule that where the benefitis tied to sales to a market other than the United States, no countervailablesubsidy exists. See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Roses and Other Cut Flowers from Colombia</T3>, 51 FR 44931 (1986);<T3>Certain Table Wine from Italy</T3>, 49 FR 6778 (1984); and <T3>Apparel from Thailand</T3>, 50 FR 9818 (1985). The third sentence of paragraph (b) describes the method for calculatingthe <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate where a benefit is tied to sales to theUnited States. Under paragraph (b)(1), the Secretary will divide a firm'sbenefit by the firm's total exports to the United States. <T3>Compare Circular Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes from Thailand</T3>,50 FR 32751 (1985), <T3>with Cast-Iron Pipe Fittings from Brazil</T3>, 50 FR 8755 (1985). Paragraph(b)(2) adds an additional refinement in that if a benefit is tied to theexport of a particular product (or products) to the United States, theSecretary will calculate the subsidy rate by dividing a firm's benefitby the firm's exports of the particular product (or products) to the UnitedStates. <T3>Paragraph (c)</T3>. Paragraph (c) deals with untied benefits. The firstsentence of paragraph (c)(1) provides that where a benefit is not tiedto a particular product or market, the Secretary will allocate the benefitto all products produced by a firm where the benefit is received pursuantto a domestic program, and to all products exported by a firm where thebenefit is received pursuant to an export program. The second sentence of paragraph (c)(1) deals with the calculation of the<T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate for untied benefits. Paragraph (c)(1)(i)provides that in the case of a domestic program, the Secretary will dividea firm's benefit by the firm's total sales. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) providesthat in the case of an export program, the Secretary will divide a firm'sbenefit by the firm's total exports.Paragraph (c)(2) codifies existing practice by providing that the Secretarywill treat equity infusions as untied benefits. 8. <T3>Section 355.48. </T3>Section 355.48 deals with the important conceptof the timing of receipt of a countervailable benefit. The timing of receiptof a countervailable benefit dictates the year in which the Departmentexpenses the benefit or the year in which the Department begins its allocationof the benefit over time or the calculation of an annual benefit pursuantto andSection; 355.49. Paragraph (a) describes the Department's general cash flow approach withregard to the timing of receipt of benefits. This general principle underliesthe Department's practice with respect to particular programs. Paragraph (b) then restates existing Department practice with respect tothe timing of receipt of particular types of benefits. For benefits notdescribed in paragraph (b), the Department would determine the timing ofreceipt in accordance with the general principle of paragraph (a). Paragraph (c) provides for an exception to the rules set forth in paragraphs(a) and (b). In certain situations, the application of the general rulewould enable certain countervailable subsidies to go unremedied. Typically,these situations involve ``big ticket'' items, the production and deliveryof which may extend over several years. See, <T3>e.g., Offshore Platform Jackets and Piles from Korea, </T3>51 FR 11779(1986). Paragraph (c) provides that where the Secretary determines it appropriate,the Secretary may depart from the rules set forth in paragraphs (a) and(b). Paragraph (c) also provides that where the Secretary decides to departfrom the general rules, the Secretary must explain the reasons therefor.9. <T3>Section 355.49. </T3>This section deals with the allocation of a countervailablebenefit to one or more years. The subjects covered in this section oftenare lumped loosely under the general category of subsidy ``valuation,''subjects covered by both andSection;andSection; 355.44 and 355.49. However,andSection; 355.44 largely deals with the selection of the benchmarks againstwhich various types of alleged subsidy programs are compared in order todetermine whether a countervailable benefit exists. Section 355.49 dealsprimarily with the allocation of a countervailable benefit to one or moreyears. Some conceptual overlap between andSection;andSection; 355.44 and 355.49exists because for certain types of programs, as discussed below, the determinationof the existence and amount of any countervailable benefit must be doneon a <T3>post hoc </T3>basis. It should be noted that the Act is largely silent with respect to certainpractical aspects of administering the CVD law. The Department, buildingupon Treasury practice, has filled in these gaps through administrativepractice. Under this practice, the Department measures subsidization onan annual basis. Typically, the review period in an investigation coversa single calendar or fiscal year. An administrative review may cover oneor more years. In an investigation or review, the Department attempts tocalculate the amount of countervailable benefits attributable to a particularyear, generally transforming benefits bestowed in absolute amounts into<T3>ad valorem</T3> equivalents. Section 355.49 is based upon this practiceof identifying and measuring subsidies on an annual basis. Section 355.49(a) codifies existing practice by establishing a generalrule concerning the allocation of countervailable benefits. Paragraph (a)(1)states the basic principle that the Secretary either must (1) expense theentire amount of a benefit to a single year, (2) allocate the benefit overtwo or more years, or (3) calculate an annual benefit for two or more years.The term ``expense'' in paragraph (a)(1) reflects existing Department terminology,and essentially means that the entire amount of the benefit is allocatedto the year in which the benefit is deemed to be received under andSection;355.48. The phrase ``depending upon the nature of the benefit in question,'' whileadmittedly imprecise, is intended to reflect the fact that the choice betweenexpensing versus allocation usually depends upon the precise nature ofthe benefit in question. Generally, the choice between expensing and allocationdepends upon whether (1) the benefit in question is a recurring benefit,and (2) the Secretary can calculate a ``grant equivalent'' for the benefitat the time of its receipt (<T3>i.e., </T3>the total amount of any countervailable benefit is not contingentupon future events or benchmarks). The phrase ``calculate an annual benefit''refers to the practice of determining an annual amount for those benefitsthat are not expensed, but also are not ``allocated'' because the Secretarycannot calculate a ``grant equivalent'' at the time of receipt. Paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) are intended to compensate for the imprecisionin paragraph (a)(1) by providing definitive guidance for certain typesof benefits. Paragraph (a)(2) provides that recurring benefits (benefitswhich a firm receives, or is likely to receive, on an ongoing basis fromreview period to review period) shall be expensed. Typical examples ofsuch benefits are direct tax exemptions or deductions, excessive rebatesof indirect taxes or import duties, preferential short-term financing,and the preferential provision of goods and services. Factors the Departmentconsiders in determining whether a benefit is recurring are: (1) Whetherthe program providing the benefit is exceptional; (2) whether the programis of longstanding; and (3) whether there is any reason to believe thatthe program will not continue into the future. See, <T3>e.g., Live Swine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork Products from Canada,</T3>50 FR 25097 (1985); and <T3>Fresh Atlantic Groundfish from Canada, </T3>57 FR 10041 (1986). Paragraph (a)(3) identifies those benefits that the Secretary will allocateover two or more review periods. Paragraph (a)(3)(i) restates existingpractice with respect to nonrecurring grants and equity infusions foundto confer a countervailable benefit as a result of a comparison to themarket price for a firm's shares. See Subsidies Appendix at 18018. Underparagraph (a)(3)(i), the Secretary will allocate over time a nonrecurringgrant or equity infusion where the total amount of all such grants or infusionsreceived during a year under a particular program is equal to or greaterthan 0.50 percent of a firm's exports or total sales, as appropriate. Thepurpose of this rule is to avoid any anomalies caused by the interactionof the Department's allocation formula and the <T3>de minimis </T3>rule contained in andSection; 355.7 of the Commerce Regulations.<T3>Id. </T3>Paragraph (a)(3)(ii) provides that the Secretary will allocate over timebenefits from long-term loans for which both the government and the benchmarkinterest rates are fixed. Essentially, these are loans for which the Secretarycan calculate a ``grant equivalent'' of the countervailable benefit atthe time of receipt of the loan.Paragraph (b)(1) codifies existing practice by describing in general termsthe process used for allocating grants and certain equity infusions overtime. Paragraph (b)(1) prescribes a three-step process under which theSecretary will (1) calculate the amount of the countervailable benefit;(2) assign a discount rate; and (3) construct a benefit stream. See generally,Subsidies Appendix. Paragraph (b)(2) prescribes the discount rate to be used, and constitutesa change from existing practice. As stated in the Subsidies Appendix, theDepartment has attempted to use a firm's ``weighted cost of capital'' (``WCC'')as the discount rate. This is because a firm's time preference for moneyis determined by its expected rate of return on investment and operationsat the time it receives a subsidy. The firm's cost of raising money, itsWCC, is the best surrogate for the expected rate of return. Subsidies Appendixat 18017. However, we stated in the Subsidies Appendix that while the WCCwas the most accurate discount rate, there were practical investigatoryproblems in using the WCC. <T3>Id.</T3> at 18017-18. Thus, we indicated that we might change thispractice in the future ``if difficulties in finding the information systematicallyprohibit us from using [the WCC] as a discount rate.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 18018. Since 1984, we rarely have been able to calculate a firm's WCC. Typically,we have been forced to use some alternative figure as a ``best information''discount rate. See, <T3>e.g., Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, </T3>51 FR 5386 (1986);<T3>Carbon Black from Mexico, </T3>51 FR 13269 (1986); <T3>Viscose Rayon Staple Fiber from Sweden, </T3>51 FR 29145 (1986); and<T3>Stainless Steel Plate from the United Kingdom, </T3>51 FR 34112 (1986).Valuable time of Department staff and parties to proceedings has been wastedseeking a figure which, in most instances, turns out to be unavailable.Therefore, paragraph (b)(2) establishes a new hierarchy of discount rates,replacing the WCC. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i), the preferred discount rateis a firm's cost of long-term fixed-rate debt. If this figure is not available,paragraph (b)(2)(ii) prescribes the use of the national average cost forlong-term fixed-rate debt in the country in question. If the latter informationis not available, paragraph (b)(2)(iii) authorizes the use of a discountrate which the Secretary considers to be the most appropriate in the particularcase. The last sentence of paragraph (b)(2) restates existing practiceby providing that the Secretary will select a discount rate based upondata for the year in which the foreign government and the firm reachedagreement on the essential terms of the grant or equity infusion. SubsidiesAppendix at 18017. Paragraph (b)(3) codifies existing practice by setting forth the formulaused to construct the benefit stream referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(iii).It should be noted that this formula codifies existing practice with respectto the number of years over which a grant or equity infusion is allocated(``n'' in the formula). As drafted, the Department would continue to usethe IRS tables as the standard for allocating grants and equity infusions.As drafted and as discussed below, the Department also would continue touse the life-of-the-loan as the allocation period for long-term loans.However, as an alternative to the IRS tables and life-of-the-loan, theDepartment is considering using a fixed period of ten years as the allocationperiod for all types of nonexpensed benefits in all cases. This ten-yearperiod would apply not only to grants and equity infusions covered by paragraph(b), but also would apply to loans and equity infusions covered by paragraphs(c) through (e) of andSection; 355.49.The reason for selecting a fixed ten-year period is that, as stated inthe Subsidies Appendix at 18018, ``[t]here are no economic or financialrules that mandate the choice of an allocation period.'' One can arguethat theoretically, a subsidy benefits a firm forever, thereby renderingarbitrary any allocation period short of infinity. Moreover, the statuteis silent with respect to the allocation of benefits over time, and whatlittle legislative history there is on the subject deals with the ``shape''of the benefit stream rather than its ``length.'' See S. Rep. No. 261,96th Cong., 1st Sess. 85-86 (1979). At most, the legislative history exhortsthe Department to use a ``reasonable'' method of allocation. <T3>Id. </T3>In determining a ``reasonable'' allocation period, the Department mustbalance the conflicting demands of the statute. The period selected mustbe substantively fair to the interests of both domestic and foreign parties.However, the Department must select a period which facilitates the administrationof the statute in a timely manner, and which offers predictability fordomestic and foreign parties. Thus far, the alternatives considered bythe Department have suffered from one or more drawbacks. The use of firms'accounting useful life as reflected in their records suffers from the factthat a firm may select a useful life for a variety of reasons, such astax liability. Thus, to use firms' accounting useful life could resultin drastically different benefit amounts even though firms might be receivingidentical subsidies and might be otherwise identically situated. Likewise,the tax tables of other countries often are designed to promote certaingovernmental objectives, and do not necessarily reflect the useful lifeof assets. Moreover, to use the tax tables of the country under investigationwould produce different benefit amounts between countries. Although the IRS tables provide consistency and predictability, the Departmentis concerned that those tables are dated. Moreover, the premise that theduration of the benefit from a subsidy differs (or should differ) dependingon the industry in question is debatable. As for the Department's life-of-the-loanallocation method, one can argue that the duration of a benefit shouldnot depend upon the form in which the benefit is conferred. Therefore, as stated above, the Department is considering the use of aten-year period for all nonexpensed benefits. Based upon the Department'sexperience with these types of benefits, the use of a ten-year period wouldprovide adequate protection to domestic parties and would be fair to foreignproducers. In addition, the use of a ten-year period would ensure consistencyand predictability of results, and, from the Department's standpoint, wouldbe more administrable than the alternatives. Before adopting this approach, however, the Department wishes to receivecomments on: (1) The use of a set allocation period for all types of nonexpensedbenefits; and (2) the selection of ten years, as opposed to some othertime period. Paragraph (c)(1) describes the process for allocating certain long-termloans over time. As set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(ii), these are loansfor which the government and benchmark interest rates are long-term, fixedrates. Thus, the Department is able to calculate a ``grant equivalent''for these types of loans. Paragraph (c)(1) describes a three-step allocationprocess similar to the one in paragraph (b)(1) for grants and equity infusions.The principal difference is that pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i), the Secretarymust determine the ``grant equivalent'' of the loan by calculating thepresent value of the difference in payments between the government loanand the benchmark loan. Paragraph (c)(2) sets forth the present value formulafor calculating this grant equivalent, using the benchmark rate as thediscount rate. The last sentence of paragraph (c)(2) reflects existingDepartment practice concerning the so-called ``grant cap.'' In order toavoid calculating a benefit greater than if the Department treated theloan as a grant, the amount calculated under paragraph (c)(2) may not exceedthe face value of the loan principal. Paragraph (c)(3) sets forth the discount rate to be used for purposes ofallocating the benefit from the loan over time. This is the same discountrate used to calculate the grant equivalent under paragraph (c)(2); namely,the benchmark rate. It should be noted that as under existing practice,in the case of a long-term loan to an uncreditworthy firm, the Departmentwould use the ``risk premium'' benchmark rate calculated under andSection;355.44(b)(6)(iv). See <T3>Stainless Steel Plate from the United Kingdom, </T3>51 FR 34112 (1986).Paragraph (c)(4) sets forth the formula for constructing the benefit streampursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(iii), and reflects existing practice. As notedabove, if the Department were to adopt a fixed ten-year allocation periodfor all benefits, ``n'' in the formula would be ten years, rather thanthe number of years in the life of the loan. Paragraph (d) deals with the calculation of the annual benefit from long-termloans for which the Secretary cannot calculate a grant equivalent; <T3>i.e., </T3>loans for which either the government or benchmark interestrate is not a long-term, fixed rate. Paragraph (d)(1) provides that foreach year in which the loan is outstanding, the Secretary will determinethe amount of the ``loan differential''; <T3>i.e., </T3>the difference between what the firm paid during the yearunder the government loan and what the firm would have paid during theyear under the benchmark loan. This loan differential is the countervailablebenefit for the particular year. Paragraph (d)(2) provides that the number of years in which a long-termloan is capable of conferring a countervailable benefit shall be the numberof years in the loan. Thus, for example, in the case of a loan with a lifeof ten years, the last year in which the loan could be capable of providinga countervailable benefit would be the tenth year of the loan. Again, however,if the Department adopts a fixed ten-year allocation period for all benefits,the number of years would be ten years, rather than the number of yearsin the life of the loan. Under existing practice, the Department will not assess countervailingduties attributable to a loan in an amount greater than that which wouldbe calculated if the Department simply treated the loan as a grant. Paragraph(d)(3) codifies this principle by providing that the amount calculatedunder paragraph (d)(1) may not exceed the amount that would have been calculatedif the Secretary had treated the loan principal as a grant and calculatedthe annual benefit pursuant to andSection; 355.49(b).Paragraph (e) codifies the Department's so-called ``rate of return shortfall''method for valuing equity infusions found to be countervailable pursuantto andSection; 355.44(e)(1)(ii); <T3>i.e., </T3>infusions in unequityworthy firms for which there are nomarket-determined share prices. See Subsidies Appendix at 18020. Underthis method, in a given year, the Secretary will multiply the amount ofthe equity infusion by the difference between a firm's rate of return onequity and the average rate of return on equity for firms in the countryin question. The Secretary will use rates of return for the year in question.The Secretary then will use the product of this multiplication as the amountof the countervailable benefit attributable to the equity infusion forthe particular year. The last sentence of paragraph (e)(1) codifies existingpractice with respect to dividend payments. If a firm pays dividends toits government during the year in which the Secretary is measuring therate of return shortfall, the Secretary will subtract the amount of thedividends paid in calculating any countervailable benefit, provided thatsuch dividends were not included in the firm's rate of return. See, <T3>e.g., Certain Carbon Steel Products from Sweden, </T3>50 FR 33375 (1985).Paragraph (e)(2) provides that the number of years in which an equity infusionis capable of conferring a countervailable benefit shall be the averageuseful life of the firm's renewable physical assets, as set forth in theIRS tables. Thus, for example, in the case of a firm for which the averageuseful life of assets is ten years, the last year in which an equity infusioncould be capable of providing a countervailable benefit would be the tenthyear from the date of receipt of the equity infusion. Again, if the Departmentadopts a fixed ten-year period, the number of years would be ten, ratherthan the useful life as set forth in the IRS tables. Under existing practice, the Department will not assess countervailingduties under the rate of return shortfall method in an amount greater thanthat which would be calculated if the Department simply treated the infusionas a grant. Paragraph (e)(3) codifies this principle by providing thatin no event will the Secretary calculate a benefit greater than the ``grantcap.'' The mechanics of calculating a grant cap under paragraph (e)(3)are identical to those for calculating the grant cap for a loan under paragraph(d)(3). Paragraph (f) deals with programs under which a government provides a long-terminterest-free loan to a firm, the obligation for repayment of which iscontingent upon subsequent events, such as the achievement of a particularprofit level by a firm. Paragraph (f) codifies current practice by providingthat in a given year the Secretary will treat any outstanding balance asan interest-free short-term loan, using the short-term loan benchmark calledfor in andSection; 355.44(b)(3), and shall expense any resulting countervailablebenefit to the year in question. Paragraph (f) does not deal with all of the different types of contingentliability programs that the Department has encountered thus far. However,the Department's experience with such programs is still relatively limited,and we prefer to gain additional experience before further codifying ourmethodology with respect to such programs. In general, however, the Department'smethodology concerning these programs has been consistent with the principlesset forth in paragraph (f). Paragraph (g) deals with government forgiveness of loans. If during a year,the government forgives all or part of the loan, the Secretary will treatsuch forgiveness as a grant to the firm and shall expense or allocate thegrant, as appropriate. Paragraph (h) is intended to deal with benefits not covered elsewhere inandSection; 355.49. Although andSection; 355.49 encompasses most of the programsdealt with by the Department, occasionally the Department encounters programsthat require a modification of the Department's standard methodology. Paragraph(h) provides that in valuing the benefits from such unusual programs, theDepartment will apply the underlying principles of andSection; 355.49. 10. <T3>Section 355.50. </T3>Section 355.50 codifies existing Department practicewith respect to program-wide changes. In an investigation or administrativereview, the Department typically bases its determination on an analysisof countervailable subsidies conferred during a clearly delineated reviewperiod. In an investigation, the Department's analysis of subsidy activityduring this review period will dictate whether the final determinationis affirmative or negative. In an administrative review, the Department'sanalysis of subsidy activity during the review period will form the basisfor the CVD assessment rate. In both investigations and administrativereviews, the Department's analysis of subsidy activity during the reviewperiod also normally forms the basis of the estimated CVD cash depositrate. However, pursuant to established practice, which the Department firstarticulated in <T3>Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Peru, </T3>50 FR 9871 (1985),the Department will adjust the cash deposit rate to take into account certainchanges in subsidy programs occurring after the review period, but priorto a preliminary determination or preliminary results of administrativereview. Paragraph (a) of andSection; 355.50 sets forth the general rule, which isthat the Department will adjust the cash deposit rate for program-widechanges occurring subsequent to the review period, but before a preliminarydetermination (in an investigation) or a preliminary results of review(in an administrative review). This adjustment may either increase or decreasethe subsidy rate found during the review period. Pursuant to paragraph(a)(2), the Secretary must be able to measure the change in the level ofcountervailable subsidies provided under the program in question. For example,in the case of certain loan programs, there may be many factors affectingthe subsidy rate, not all of which can be quantified in advance. See, <T3>e.g., Textile Mill Products from Thailand, </T3>52 FR 7636 (1987);and <T3>Textile Mill Products from Mexico, </T3>50 FR 10824 (1985); <T3>see also, Live Swine from Canada, </T3>53 FR 22189 (1988). Paragraph (b) defines ``program-wide'' change for purposes of andSection;355.50. First, the change must not be limited to an individual firm orfirms. See, <T3>e.g., Heavy Iron Construction Castings from Brazil, </T3>51 FR 9491(1986); and <T3>Offshore Platform Jackets and Piles from Korea, </T3>51 FR 11779 (1986).In this regard, the Department would treat the exclusion of particularproducts from eligibility for benefits under a program as a program-widechange. <T3>Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Peru, </T3>50 FR 9871 (1985).Second, the change must be implemented by an official act, such as theenactment of a statute or regulation or the issuance of a decree, or becontained in the schedule of an existing statute, regulation, or decree.Paragraph (c) clarifies that the program-wide change rule applies onlyto the calculation of the cash deposit rate. It does not affect the characterizationof a determination as affirmative or negative, such characterization beingbased solely on the analysis of subsidy activity during the applicablereview period. Paragraph (d) deals with situations in which a government terminates aprogram. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1), if the Secretary determined thatresidual benefits continued to be bestowed under the terminated program,the Secretary would not adjust the deposit rate. Also, pursuant to paragraph(d)(2), if a government introduced a substitute program in place of theterminated program and the Secretary was unable to measure the amount ofcountervailable subsidies provided under the new program, the Secretarywould not adjust the cash deposit rate pursuant to paragraph (a). See <T3>Lamb Meat from New Zealand, </T3>50 FR 37708 (1985); <T3>cf., Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Argentina, </T3>50 FR 9846(1985). 11. <T3>Section 355.51. </T3>Section 355.51 codifies the current method ofcalculating the weighted-average net subsidy rate on a country-wide basis.As provided in andSection; 355.20(d) and andSection; 355.22(d), the Secretarynormally will calculate a country-wide subsidy rate, unless the rate foran individual firm is significantly different from the country-wide rate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of this document is William D.

(2) Where exportation is only one of many eligibility criteria for benefitsunder a program, the inclusion of exportation as a criterion shall not<T3>per se </T3>constitute selective treatment within the meaning of paragraph(a)(1) of this section. (b)(1) <T3>Domestic programs. </T3>Selective treatment, and a potential countervailabledomestic subsidy, exists where the Secretary determines that benefits undera program are provided, or are required to be provided, in law or in fact,to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries.(2) In determining whether benefits are specific under paragraph (b)(1)of this section, the Secretary will consider, among other things, the followingfactors: (i) The extent to which a government acts to limit the availability ofa program; (ii) The number of enterprises, industries, or groups thereof that actuallyuse a program; (iii) Whether there are dominant users of a program, or whether certainenterprises, industries, or groups thereof receive disproportionately largebenefits under a program; and (iv) The extent to which a government exercises discretion in conferringbenefits under a program. (3) The Secretary will deem a program to be specific within the meaningof paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the Secretary determines that benefitsunder a program are limited to enterprises or industries located in a specificregion or regions of a country. In applying this paragraph, the Secretarymay consider the proportion of enterprises or industries located in theregion or regions in question as compared with the rest of the country.(4) The Secretary will not regard the provision of infrastructure by agovernment as specific within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section,provided the Secretary determines that: (i) The government does not limit who can move into the area where theinfrastructure has been built; (ii) The infrastructure that has been built is in fact used by more thana specific enterprise or industry, or group thereof; and (iii) Those that locate in the area have equal access to, or receive thebenefit of, the infrastructure on the basis of neutral and objective criteria.(5) Where a benefit is provided pursuant to a program of a state, provincial,or local government, the Secretary will determine the specificity of thebenefit for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section based upon theavailability and use of the program within the state, provincial, or localjurisdiction of the government in question. (6) Unless the Secretary determines that two or more programs are integrallylinked, the Secretary will determine the specificity of a program for purposesof paragraph (b)(1) of this section solely on the basis of the availabilityand use of the particular program in question. In determining whether programsare integrally linked, the Secretary will examine, among other factors,the administration of the programs, evidence of a government policy totreat industries equally, the purposes of the programs as stated in theirenabling legislation, and the manner of funding the programs. (7) The Secretary will not regard a program as being specific, within themeaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, solely because the programis limited to small firms or small- and medium-sized firms. (8) The Secretary will not regard a program as being specific, within themeaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, solely because the programis limited to the agricultural sector. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 355.44 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Existence of a countervailable benefit. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Grants. </T3>In the case of a program providing a grant, a countervailablebenefit exists in the amount of the grant.(b)(1) <T3>Loans. </T3>A loan provided by a government confers a countervailablebenefit to the extent that the amount paid by a firm for the governmentloan is less than what the firm would pay for a benchmark loan. (2) In making the comparison required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section,the Secretary will take into account any deferral of principal repaymentsor interest payments on a government loan. Unless such deferral is a normalor customary lending practice in the country in question, the deferralof principal repayments or interest payments provides a countervailablebenefit to the extent that the deferral results in a total loan repaymentthat is less than the repayment would have been in the absence of the deferral.(3)(i) In the case of a short-term loan provided by a government, the Secretarywill use as a benchmark the average interest rate for an alternative sourceof short-term financing in the country in question. In determining thisbenchmark, the Secretary normally will rely upon the predominant sourceof short-term financing in the country in question. Where there is no single,predominant source of short-term financing, the Secretary may use a benchmarkcomposed of the interest rates for two or more sources of short-term financingin the country in question, weighted, wherever possible, according to thevalue of financing from each source. (ii) For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, ``predominant''means that type of short-term financing the total value of which is greaterthan or equal to 50 percent of the total value of short-term financing,in local currency, in the relevant country. (iii) For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, unless short-terminterest rates in the country in question have fluctuated significantlyduring the year in question, the Secretary will calculate a single, annualaverage benchmark interest rate. (4) In the case of a long-term loan provided by a government for whichthe interest rate is fixed, the Secretary will use as a benchmark the following,in order of preference: (i) The interest rate on a fixed-rate, long-term loan taken out in thesame year by the firm receiving the government loan; (ii) The interest rate on a fixed-rate debt obligation issued in the sameyear by the firm receiving the government loan; (iii) The interest rate on a variable-rate, long-term loan taken out inthe same year by the firm receiving the government loan; (iv) The national average long-term fixed interest rate in the countryin question; (v) The national long-term variable interest rate in the country in question;or (vi) A short-term benchmark rate determined in accordance with paragraph(b)(3) of this section. (5) In the case of a long-term loan provided by a government for whichthe interest rate is variable, the Secretary will use as a benchmark thefollowing, in order of preference: (i) The interest rate on a variable-rate, long-term loan taken out in thesame year by the firm receiving the government loan;  (ii) the interest rate on a fixed-rate, long-term loan taken out in thesame year by the firm receiving the government loan; (iii) The interest rate on a fixed-rate debt obligation issued in the sameyear by the firm receiving the government loan; (iv) The national average long-term variable interest rate in the countryin question; (v) The national average long-term fixed interest rate in the country inquestion; or (vi) A short-term benchmark rate determined in accordance with paragraph(b)(3) of this section. (6)(i) The Secretary will deem a firm to be uncreditworthy if the Secretarydetermines that the firm did not have sufficient revenues or resourcesto meet its costs and fixed financial obligations in the three years priorto the year in which the firm and the government agreed upon the termsof the loan. The Secretary will determine creditworthiness on a case-by-casebasis, and may examine, among other factors, the following: (A) The receipt by a firm of comparable long-term commercial loans; (B) The present and past financial health of a firm, as reflected in variousfinancial indicators calculated from the firm's financial statements andaccounts; (C) A firm's recent past and present ability to meet its costs and fixedfinancial obligations with its cash flow; and (D) Evidence of a firm's future financial position, such as market studies,country and industry economic forecasts, and project and loan appraisals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Normally, the receipt by a firm of comparable long-term commercialloans, provided without an explicit government guarantee, shall constitutedispositive evidence that the firm is creditworthy. (ii) The Secretary normally will not consider the creditworthiness of afirm absent a specific allegation by the petitioner which is supportedby information establishing a reasonable basis to believe or suspect thatthe firm is uncreditworthy. (iii) In making a determination under paragraph (b)(6)(i), the Secretarywill ignore countervailable subsidies that currently benefit the firm orthat benefited the firm in the past.(iv) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if the Secretarydeems a firm to be uncreditworthy pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(i) of thissection, the Secretary will calculate the benchmark interest rate for along-term government loan by taking the sum of 12 percent of the primeinterest rate in the country in question and: (A) If the government loan has a fixed interest rate, in order of preference:(1) The highest long-term fixed interest rate commonly available to firmsin the country in question; (2) The highest long-term variable interest rate commonly available tofirms in the country in question; or (3) The short-term benchmark interest rate determined in accordance withparagraph (b)(3) of this section; or (B) If the government loan has a variable interest rate, in order of preference:(1) The highest long-term variable interest rate commonly available tofirms in the country in question; (2) The highest long-term fixed interest rate commonly available to firmsin the country in question; or (3) The short-term benchmark interest rate determined in accordance withparagraph (b)(3) of this section. (v) In determining whether a short-term loan provided by a government confersa countervailable benefit, the creditworthiness of a firm will be irrelevant.(7) In identifying a benchmark under paragraph (b) of this section, theSecretary will attempt to use, where possible, a nongovernment source offinancing. Where necessary, however, the Secretary may use loans made availableunder one or more government programs, provided that any such program isnot deemed to be selective within the meaning of andSection; 355.43. (8) In comparing a government loan with a benchmark loan under paragraph(b) of this section, the Secretary will compare the effective interestrate of the government loan with the effective interest rate of the benchmarkloan. Where the Secretary cannot quantify the effective rate, either withrespect to the government loan or the benchmark loan, the Secretary willcompare the nominal interest rate of the government loan with the nominalinterest rate of the benchmark loan. Only as a last resort will the Secretarycompare a nominal interest rate with an effective interest rate in establishingthe interest rate differential. (9) Notwithstanding andSection; 355.41(b), the Secretary will not considera loan provided by a government-owned bank, <T3>per se,</T3>  to be a loan provided by the government, and the Secretarywill not investigate a loan from a government-owned bank absent a specificallegation which is supported by information establishing a reasonablebasis to believe or suspect that: (i) The government-owned bank provided the loan at the direction of thegovernment or with funds provided by the government, and (ii) The terms of the loan were inconsistent with commercial considerations.(c)(1) <T3>Loan guarantees. </T3>In the case of an explicit guarantee by a governmentof a loan to a firm, a countervailable benefit exists to the extent theSecretary determines that: (i) The price or fee paid by the firm for the government guarantee is lessthan the price the firm would have paid for a comparable commercial guarantee,or (ii) The amount paid by the firm for the guaranteed loan is less than whatthe firm would have paid for benchmark financing pursuant to paragraph(b) of this section. (2) The explicit guarantee by a government of a loan to a firm shall notconfer a countervailable benefit if the government is a principal owneror majority shareholder of the firm and it is a normal commercial practicein the country in question for owners or shareholders to provide loan guaranteeson comparable terms to their firms. (d)(1) <T3>Export insurance. </T3>The provision by a government of export insuranceconfers a countervailable benefit to the extent the Secretary determinesthat the premium rates charged are manifestly inadequate to cover the long-termoperating costs and losses of the program over the past five years, upto and including the year in question. In determining whether premium ratesare manifestly inadequate, the Secretary will determine whether there isa substantial gap between premiums charged and costs and losses incurredunder the program, and will take into account income from other insuranceprograms operated by the entity in question. (2) Where the Secretary determines that the premium rates charged are manifestlyinadequate, the Secretary will calculate the amount of the countervailablebenefit by calculating the excess of the amount received by a firm overthe amount of premiums paid by the firm. (e)(1) <T3>Equity. </T3>The provision of equity by a government to a firm confersa countervailable benefit to the extent the Secretary determines that:(i) The market-determined price for equity purchased directly from thefirm is less than the price paid by the government for the same form ofequity purchased directly from the firm; or (ii) In the event that there is no market-determined price, the firm isnot equityworthy and there is a rate of return shortfall within the meaningof andSection; 355.49(e). (2) A firm is equityworthy within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) ofthis section if the Secretary determines that, from the perspective ofa reasonable private investor examining the firm at the time the governmentequity infusion was made, the firm showed an ability to generate a reasonablerate of return within a reasonable period of time. In making this determination,the Secretary may examine the following factors, among others: (i) Current and past indicators of a firm's financial health calculatedfrom that firm's statements and accounts, adjusted, if appropriate, toconform to generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) Future financial prospects of the firm, including market studies,economic forecasts, and project or loan appraisals; (iii) Rates of return on equity in the three years prior to the governmentequity infusion; and (iv) Equity investment in the firm by private investors.(3) The Secretary will not investigate an equity infusion in a firm absenta specific allegation by the petitioner which is supported by informationestablishing a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that a firm has receivedan equity infusion which provides a countervailable benefit within themeaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. (4) In making a determination under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, theSecretary will ignore countervailable subsidies that currently benefitthe firm or benefited the firm in the past. (f)(1) <T3>Provision of goods or services at preferential rates. </T3>The provisionby a government of a good or service pursuant to a domestic program confersa countervailable benefit to the extent the Secretary determines that theprice charged by the government for the good or service is less than thebenchmark price, which normally will be the nonselective prices the governmentcharges to the same or other users of the good or service within the samepolitical jurisdiction. (2) Where the Secretary determines that there is no benchmark price underparagraph (f)(1) which is not selective within the meaning of andSection;355.43, the Secretary will determine the existence of a countervailablebenefit based upon, in order of preference, the following alternative benchmarks:(i) The price, adjusted for any cost differences, the government chargesfor a good or service which is similar or related to the good or servicein question, provided that the similar or related good or service and itsprice is not selective within the meaning of andSection; 355.43; (ii) The price charged by other sellers to buyers within the same politicaljurisdiction for an identical good or service; (iii) The government's cost of providing the good or service; or (iv) The price paid for the identical good or service outside of the politicaljurisdiction in question. (g)(1) <T3>Internal transport and freight charges for export shipments. </T3>Wherea government provides internal transport and freight services pursuantto an export program, a countervailable benefit exists to the extent theSecretary determines that the charges paid by a firm for transport or freightwith respect to goods destined for export are less than what the firm wouldhave paid if the goods were destined for domestic consumption. (2) For purposes of paragraph (g)(1), a countervailable benefit does notexist where the Secretary determines that: (i) Any difference in charges is the result of an arm's length transactionbetween the supplier and the user of the transport or freight service;or (ii) The difference in charges is commercially justified. (h) <T3>Price preferences for inputs used in the production of goods for export.</T3>The delivery by a government of imported or domestic products foruse in the production of exported goods confers a countervailable benefitto the extent the Secretary determines that the terms or conditions aremore favorable than for delivery of like or directly competitive productsor services for use in the production of goods for domestic consumption,and if such terms or conditions are more favorable than those commerciallyavailable on world markets to their exporters. (i)(1) <T3>Taxes and import charges. </T3>A countervailable benefit exists tothe extent the Secretary determines that the taxes paid by a firm are lessthan the taxes it otherwise would have paid in the absence of a programproviding for: (i) A full or partial exemption, remission, or deferral of a direct taxor social welfare charge; or(ii) A reduction in the base used to calculate a direct tax or social welfarecharge. (2) A countervailable benefit exists to the extent the Secretary determinesthat the taxes or import charges paid by a firm are less than the taxesit otherwise would have paid in the absence of a domestic program providingfor the full or partial exemption, remission, or deferral of an indirecttax or import charge. (3) The exemption or remission upon export of indirect taxes not in excessof those levied with respect to the production and distribution of likeproducts when sold for domestic consumption shall not confer a countervailablebenefit. (4)(i) The exemption, remission, deferral or drawback of prior stage cumulativeindirect taxes on goods or services used in the production of exportedproducts in excess of the exemption, remission, deferral or drawback oflike prior stage cumulative indirect taxes on goods or services used inthe production of like products when sold for domestic consumption shallconfer a countervailable benefit; provided that the nonexcessive exemption,remission, deferral, or drawback of prior stage cumulative indirect taxesor import charges levied on goods that are physically incorporated, makingnormal allowances for waste (but not taxes or import charges on services,catalysts, and other items not so incorporated), in the exported productshall not confer a countervailable benefit. (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(4)(i), in the case of a program purportingto rebate prior stage cumulative indirect taxes and/or import charges,or in the case of a program providing for a fixed rate of duty drawback,the entire amount of the rebate or drawback shall confer a countervailablebenefit, unless the Secretary determines that: (A) The program operates for the purpose of rebating prior stage cumulativeindirect taxes and/or import charges; (B) The government accurately ascertained the level of the rebate or fixedduty drawback; and (C) The government reexamines its schedules periodically. (j) <T3>Worker assistance. </T3>The provision by a government of financialassistance to workers confers a countervailable benefit to the extent thatsuch assistance relieves a firm of an obligation which it normally wouldincur. (k) <T3>Forgiveness of debt. </T3>The assumption or forgiveness by a governmentof an outstanding debt obligation of a firm confers a countervailable benefitequal to the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest at the timeof the assumption or forgiveness. Where a government receives shares ina firm in return for eliminating or reducing a firm's debt obligation,the Secretary shall determine the existence of a countervailable benefitin accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section. (l) <T3>Research and development assistance. </T3>Notwithstanding any otherprovision of this section, assistance provided by a government to a firmin order to finance research and development does not confer a countervailablebenefit where the Secretary determines that the results of such researchand development have been, or will be, made available to the public, includingcompetitors of the firm in the United States. (m) <T3>General export promotion. </T3>Notwithstanding any other provisionof this section, export promotion activities of a government shall notconfer a countervailable benefit where the Secretary determines that suchactivities consist of general informational activities which do not promoteparticular products over others. (n) <T3>Programs with varying levels of benefits. </T3>Notwithstanding anyother provision of this section, where a government program provides varyinglevels of benefits with different eligibility criteria, and one or moreof such levels is not selective within the meaning of andSection; 355.43,a countervailable benefit exists to the extent that a firm receives benefitsunder the program which are more favorable than the most favorable, nonselectivelevel of benefits available under the program. The preceding sentence shallapply only to the extent the Secretary determines that the firm would havebeen eligible for the nonselective benefits under the program. (o)(1) <T3>Transnational benefits. </T3>Notwithstanding any other provision ofthis section, a countervailable benefit does not exist to the extent theSecretary determines that funding for a benefit is provided by a governmentother than the government of the country in which the merchandise is producedor from which the merchandise is exported, or by an international lendingor development institution. (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (o)(1) of this section, if the members (orother participating entities) of an international consortium that is engagedin the production of a class or kind of merchandise subject to a countervailingduty proceeding receive countervailable subsidies from their respectivehome countries to assist, permit, or otherwise enable their participationin that consortium through production or manufacturing operations in theirrespective home countries, then the Secretary will cumulate all such benefits,as well as benefits provided directly to the international consortium,in determining any countervailing duty upon such merchandise. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 355.45 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Upstream Subsidies.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>The term upstream subsidy means any domestic countervailablesubsidy provided by the government of a country that: (1) Is paid or bestowed by that government with respect to an input productwhich is used in the production in that country of the merchandise;(2) In the judgment of the Secretary bestows a competitive benefit on themerchandise; and (3) Has a significant effect on the cost of producing the merchandise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of this paragraph, an association of two or more foreigncountries, political subdivisions, dependent territories, or possessionsof foreign countries organized into a customs union outside the UnitedStates shall be treated as being one country if the subsidy is providedby the customs union. (b) <T3>Threshold determination. </T3>Before investigating the existence ofan upstream subsidy, the Secretary must have a reasonable basis to believeor suspect that all of the following elements exist: (1) A domestic countervailable subsidy is provided with respect to an inputproduct; (2) One of the following conditions exists: (i) The supplier of the input product controls the producer of the merchandise,the producer controls the supplier, or the supplier and the producer areboth controlled by a third person; (ii) The price for the input product is lower than the price that the producerotherwise would pay for the input product in obtaining it from an unsubsidizedseller in an arm's length transaction; or (iii) The government sets the price of the input product so as to guaranteethat the benefit provided with respect to the input product is passed throughto producers of the merchandise; and (3) The <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate on the input product multiplied by theproportion of the total production costs of the merchandise accounted forby the input product is equal to, or greater than, one percent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretarywill not consider common government ownership to constitute control. (c) <T3>Input product. </T3>For purposes of this section, the term ``inputproduct'' means any product used in the production of the merchandise.(d) <T3>Competitive benefit. </T3>In evaluating whether a competitive benefitexists pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary willdetermine whether the price for the input product is lower than: (1) The price which the producer of the merchandise otherwise would payfor the input product, produced in the same country, in obtaining it fromanother unsubsidized seller in an arm's length transaction; or (2) A world market price for the input product. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, where the Secretaryhas determined in a previous proceeding that a domestic countervailablesubsidy is paid or bestowed on the input product which is used for comparison,the Secretary may, where appropriate, adjust the price which the producerof the merchandise otherwise would pay for the input product to reflectthe effects of the subsidy. (e) <T3>Significant effect. </T3>For purposes of evaluating whether a significanteffect exists pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Secretarywill multiply the <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate on the input product by the proportionof the total production costs of the merchandise accounted for by the inputproduct. If the input subsidy so allocated to the merchandise exceeds fivepercent, the Secretary will presume the existence of a significant effect.If the input subsidy so allocated to the merchandise is less than one percent,the Secretary will presume the absence of a significant effect. If theinput subsidy so allocated to the merchandise is between one and five percent,there shall be no presumption. A party may rebut these presumptions bypresenting information which demonstrates that subsidies on the input productswill have a significant effect on the competitiveness of the merchandise.In assessing such information, the Secretary will consider the extent towhich factors other than price, such as quality differences, are importantdeterminants of demand for the merchandise. (f) <T3>Inclusion of upstream subsidy. </T3>If the Secretary determines thatan upstream subsidy is being or has been paid or bestowed, the Secretarywill include in the amount of any countervailing duty imposed on the merchandisean amount equal to the amount of the competitive benefit determined pursuantto paragraph (d) of this section; except that in no event shall the amountso included be greater than the amount of subsidization determined withrespect to the input product. (g) <T3>Processed agricultural products. </T3>Notwithstanding any other provisionof this section, the Secretary will deem domestic countervailable subsidiesfound to be provided to either producers or processors of a raw agriculturalproduct to be provided to the manufacture, production, or exportation ofthe processed agricultural product where the Secretary determines that:(1) The demand for the prior-stage product is substantially dependent onthe demand for the latter-stage product, and (2) The processing operation adds only limited value to the raw commodity.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 355.46</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Offsets. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General rule. </T3>In calculating a countervailable benefit, the Secretarymay subtract from the gross benefit, the amount of: (1) Any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualifyfor, or to receive, the benefit; (2) Any loss in the value of the benefit resulting from its deferred receipt,if the deferral is mandated by government order; and (3) Export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of themerchandise to the United States specifically intended to offset the benefitreceived.(b) <T3>Tax effects of countervailable benefits. </T3>In calculating the amountof a countervailable benefit, the Secretary will ignore the secondary taxconsequences of the benefit. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 355.47 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Allocation of countervailable benefits to a product or market andcalculation of ad valorem subsidy. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Benefits tied to a particular product. </T3>Where the Secretary determinesthat a countervailable benefit is tied to the production or sale of a particularproduct or products, the Secretary will allocate the benefit solely tothat product or products. If the Secretary determines that a countervailablebenefit is tied to a product other than the merchandise, the Secretarywill not find a countervailable subsidy on the merchandise. If the productor products to which the benefit is tied include the merchandise, the Secretarywill calculate the <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate as follows: (1) In the case of a domestic program, the Secretary will divide the benefitby a firm's total sales of the product or products to which the benefitis tied; or (2) In the case of an export program, the Secretary will divide the benefitby a firm's total exports of the product or products to which the benefitis tied. (b) <T3>Benefits tied to sales to a particular market. </T3>Where the Secretarydetermines that a countervailable benefit is tied to the sale of productsto a market other than the United States, the Secretary will not find acountervailable subsidy on the merchandise. Where a benefit is tied, orcan be tied, to exports to the United States, the Secretary will calculatethe <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate by dividing the benefit by: (1) The firm's total exports to the United States; or (2) If the benefit also is tied to exports of a particular product or products,by the firm's total exports to the United States of the product or productsto which the benefit is tied. (c)(1) <T3>Untied benefits. </T3>Where the Secretary determines that a countervailablebenefit is not tied to the production or sale of a particular product orproducts, or is not tied to the sale of products to a particular market,the Secretary will allocate the benefit to all products produced by a firm,in the case of a domestic program, or to all products exported by a firm,in the case of an export program. The Secretary will calculate the <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy rate as follows:  (i) In the case of a domestic program, the Secretary will divide the benefitby a firm's total sales; or (ii) In the case of an export program, the Secretary will divide the benefitby a firm's total exports. (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary willtreat equity infusions as untied benefits. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 355.48 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Timing of receipt of countervailable benefits. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General rule. </T3>Ordinarily, the Secretary will deem a countervailablebenefit to be received at the time that there is a cash flow effect onthe firm receiving the benefit. The cash flow and economic effect of abenefit normally occurs when a firm experiences a difference in cash flows,either in the payments it receives or the outlays it makes, as a resultof its receipt of the benefit. (b) <T3>Particular types of benefits. </T3>For purposes of paragraph (a) ofthis section, the Secretary ordinarily will deem the cash flow effect tooccur as follows: (1) In the case of a grant or equity infusion, at the time a firm receivesthe grant or equity infusion; (2) In the case of the provision of a good or service, at the time a firmpays, or in the absence of payment would have paid, for the good or service;(3) In the case of a loan, at the time a firm is due to make a paymenton the loan; (4) In the case of a direct tax benefit (other than a tax certificate describedin paragraph (b)(5) of this section), at the time a firm can calculatethe amount of the benefit, which normally will be the time at which thefirm files its tax return; (5) In the case of a tax certificate used to pay direct taxes, indirecttaxes, or import charges, at the time a firm receives the certificate;(6) In the case of an exemption of an indirect tax or import charge, atthe time a firm otherwise would be required to pay the indirect tax orimport charge; and (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (b) of this section,in the case of an export benefit provided as a percentage of the valueof the exported merchandise (such as a cash payment or an overrebate ofindirect taxes), on the date of export. (c) <T3>Exception. </T3>In unusual circumstances, the Secretary may deem abenefit to be received at a time other than a time prescribed by paragraphs(a) and (b). Where the Secretary departs from the methodology set forthin paragraphs (a) and (b), the Secretary will explain the reasons therefor.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 355.49 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Allocation of countervailable benefits over time. </ITAG>(a)(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>In valuing a countervailable benefit, dependingupon the nature of the benefit in question, the Secretary will either expensethe entire amount of the benefit in a single year, allocate the benefitover two or more years, or calculate an annual benefit for two or moreyears. (2) The Secretary will expense recurring countervailable benefits in theyear of receipt. (3) The Secretary will allocate the following nonrecurring countervailablebenefits over two or more years: (i) Grants and equity infusions found to confer a countervailable benefitpursuant to andSection; 355.44(e)(1)(i) where the total amount of grantsor equity infusions received under a particular program during a year is:(A) In the case of grants or equity infusions provided pursuant to a domesticprogram, equal to or greater than 0.50 percent of all sales of the firmin question during  the same year; or (B) In the case of grants provided pursuant to an export program, equalto or greater than 0.50 percent of the export sales of the firm in questionduring the same year; and (ii) Long-term loans where the interest rates on both the government loanand the benchmark loan are long-term fixed rates. (4) The Secretary will calculate annual benefits for long-term loans andequity infusions other than those types of loans and equity infusions referredto in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (b)(1) <T3>Process for allocating grants and certain equity infusions over time.</T3>In allocating over time the benefit from a nonrecurring grant or anequity infusion described in andSection; 355.44(e)(1)(i), the Secretary willuse the following three-step process: (i) Determine the amount of the countervailable benefit pursuant to andSection;355.44; (ii) Assign a discount rate; and (iii) Construct a benefit stream. (2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the Secretarywill use as a discount rate the following, in order of preference:(i) The cost of long-term, fixed-rate debt of the firm in question, excludingloans found to confer a countervailable subsidy; (ii) The average cost of long-term, fixed-rate debt in the country in question;or (iii) A rate which the Secretary considers to be most appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Secretary will select a discount rate based upon data for theyear in which the government and the firm agreed on the terms for receivingthe grant or equity infusion.

(3) In no event may the amount calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of thissection exceed the amount the Secretary would have calculated if the Secretaryhad treated the loan principal as a grant and calculated the annual benefitpursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. (e)(1) <T3>Equity infusions. </T3>Where a firm receives an equity infusion andthe Secretary finds the firm to be unequityworthy at the time of the infusionpursuant to andSection; 355.44(e)(1)(ii), the Secretary will determine theamount of the countervailable benefit, if any, conferred in a year by multiplyingthe difference between the firm's rate of return on equity and the nationalaverage rate of return on equity for firms in the country in question (``rateof return shortfall'') by the total amount of the equity infusion. TheSecretary will use the rates of return for the year in question. If thefirm paid dividends to the government during the year, the Secretary willsubtract the amount of such dividends from any countervailable benefitfound, provided that such dividends are not included in the firm's rateof return.(2) In determining the number of years in which an equity infusion potentiallyconfers a countervailable benefit under paragraph (e)(1) of this section,the Secretary will use the average useful life of a firm's renewable physicalassets (equipment), as set forth in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's1977 Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (Rev. Proc. 77-10, 1977-1,C.B. 548 (RR-38)).
