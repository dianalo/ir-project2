Manuel Noriega charged in an interview.   The Panamanian leader also alleged that Panamanian businessmenand Nicaraguan Contras served as messengers for U.S. officials,relaying messages between the United States and the plotters, theLos Angeles Times reported in Thursday's editions.   ``The United States was involved before, during and after thecoup,'' Noriega said. ``They had to make the contacts, woo them,convince them. It's a lot of work before you've hooked the fish.But they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish.''   ``The Contras put them the coup plotters in contact with theUnited States,'' Noriega said.   Noriega said that an investigation following the uprisingrevealed the existence of a bank account in the name of Capt. ErickA. Murillo, one of the alleged coup leaders, containing more than$1 million.   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian. Sixzeroes. It was a million-dollar account,'' Noriega said.   He charged that U.S. officials gave Murillo the money forbribes, but would not identify the bank that held the account.   Murillo, a member of the elite Battalion 2000, was one of 10officers the Panamanian government said was killed during the coupattempt.   While government reports have said 37 soldiers were detainedfollowing the attempt, Noriega said 77 have been.   Noriega also said that one of the detained rebels had $700,000in cash that he had been using to bribe the troops. He refused toidentify the soldier but said he is still in custody.   The coup was masterminded by 17 members of the Panama DefenseForces, Noriega said.   Noriega also accused National Security Council member Everett E.Briggs of involvement in the conspiracy, because Briggs visited thecountry shortly before the uprising. Briggs served as ambassador toPanama and then as ambassador to Honduras, where the Nicaraguanrebels were based.   There was no immediate comment from Briggs or an NSC spokesmanin the newspaper's account.</TEXT></DOC>
