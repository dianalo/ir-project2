(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Air Force Delta 2 propelled amilitary navigation satellite into orbit today to join a network ofspacecraft which tell U.S. and allied military forces where theyare within 50 feet anywhere in the world.   The 128-foot booster blazed away from its launch pad at 1:10p.m. after being postponed one day because of a problem with a fueltank pressurization system. The problem was corrected overnight.   ``A very smooth flight; the rocket is right on track,'' said AirForce Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the launch commentator, as the Delta 2climbed toward orbit.   Twenty-five minutes after liftoff, Rand reported the satellitehad separated and was in a proper orbit ranging out to 11,000 mileshigh. ``Everything appears to have gone very well with theflight,'' he said.   The payload is a $65 million Navstar satellite whose signals aredesigned to guide military units such as planes, ships, submarines,tanks and land forces with pinpoint accuracy.   Four similar satellites, all launched from here earlier thisyear, are orbiting Earth as part of a global navigation network.   The military launch was given priority over another rocket whoseflight was postponed last week. In that case, the liftoff of acommercial Titan 3 rocket carrying a pair of foreign communicationssatellites was delayed Thursday night by a computer softwareproblem and again Friday by stormy weather.   That launch, now rescheduled for Dec. 20, will be MartinMarietta's first commercial one for paying customers.</TEXT></DOC>
