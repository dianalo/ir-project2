Various investigations in the nation's fifth-largest city, wherethe Constitution was written 201 years ago, have resulted inconvictions or charges against judges, police, defense lawyers andprison guards, the latest target of prosecutors.   The wave of corruption has hit City Hall, itself.   A federal jury last year convicted Councilman Leland Beloff andan aide of conspiring with reputed area mob boss Nicodemo ``LittleNicky'' Scarfo to extort $1 million from a developer.   Last week, District Attorney Ronald Castille announced that thearrests of seven prison guards and a cook in an escape and aninmate's beating were part of ``Operation Ferret,'' aninvestigation expected to yield more than 100 arrests among thecity's approximately 1,400 prison guards.   Also last week, a federal judge ordered former Common PleasJudge Kenneth Harris to begin serving a 12-year sentence forextorting bribes to fix cases. Harris, 67, is one of three formercity judges who have been convicted and one of 16 who have beennamed in various investigations.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in February ordered eight judgesto be removed from the bench, six permanently, as a result of afederal investigation into cash payments from Roofers Unionofficials.   In Harris' case, a lawyer-turned-informant, Barry H. Denker,testified he gave cash to Harris and two other judges now awaitingtrial on extortion charges.   Denker also said he gave money or gifts to police, probationofficers, trial commissioners and court criers while maintaininghis practice in criminal defense law.   Another former lawyer, Romaine Phillips, was convicted ofracketeering, conspiracy and extortion in the Harris case.   Assistant District Attorney Patricia Donleavy has said three orfour lawyers may yet be charged. A former aide to Harris testifiedthree lawyers gave him money to deliver to the judge in exchangefor favorable rulings.   Investigations also have targeted the city's police force. Since1983, 34 officers have been convicted in bribery and conspiracycases, including a deputy commissioner who was convicted ofextorting money from vice figures.   Other agencies also have been hit, with garbage crews accused oftaking bribes to make pickups at businesses and city inspectorsaccused of taking bribes for licenses.   ``We talked to contractors who refused to work in this citybecause they refused to pay off the (Licenses and Inspections)inspectors or the Water Department,'' Castille said.   Castille said he must defend ``some of the hard-working judges,the hard-working city employees, the cops who put their lives onthe line and the ones who aren't corrupt.''   The court scandal has grabbed constant attention.   ``I don't remember anything that's quite comparable to what wehave now,'' said City Solicitor Seymour Kurland, who recentlystepped down as chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association.   ``My feeling now is despite the image, there's a core, a verygood core, of very fine judges. There's a very fine core of judges,of people in the city, who are making it work.''   Judges and others whose images are being tarnished by whatofficials say are a few rotten apples have become angry.   After the extortion conviction of former senior Common PleasJudge Herbert R. Cain Jr., U.S. Justice Department prosecutor EricHolder told reporters that corruption in Philadelphia's judiciary``starts at the top and goes all through the system.''   The remark prompted a heated response by Common Pleas PresidentJudge Edward J. Bradley, who said Holder should ``keep his mouthshut.''   ``I don't think what he said was widely held,'' Bradley saidlast week, adding that Holder told him in a letter that he alsotold reporters the overwhelming majority of judges were doingexcellent work.   Bradley said judicial corruption cases have presented an imageproblem.   ``Realistically, I've got to say it has caused the public tohave a lower perception of the court,'' Bradley said, noting thenumber of questioned or convicted judges is small compared with 125total judges.   In his remarks after the Cain verdict, Holder also said he was``struck by the fact that there doesn't seem to be a hue and cryfrom the citizens of this city.''   ``The way that I see it as a citizen is that if you believe thatthe city officials are corrupt or the city is corrupt, you alwayshave a last resort and that's the courts,'' Castille said.   ``So if you have the courts taking envelopes of cash, sellingverdicts ... then what else is there?''</TEXT></DOC>
