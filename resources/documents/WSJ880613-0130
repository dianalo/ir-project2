Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A House inquiry into Speaker James Wright's ethics commenced amid indications that it will be both long and politically embarrassing to Democrats.    Although Mr. Wright said that he hoped for a quick resolution of the inquest, awkward new details were still surfacing over the weekend about how he realized $54,600 from a book sold in bulk to lobbyists and wealthy friends. Other subjects under investigation could require months to untangle. Meanwhile, the ethics panel hasn't decided whether to hire an independent counsel or conduct the review internally.    Thus it appears that Mr. Wright will still be under investigation when he is scheduled to bring down the gavel to begin the Democratic National Convention five weeks from today. &quot;There's a lot of worry and concern about it,&quot; said a House Democrat, adding, &quot;we're starting to hear about it from {constituents in} the districts.&quot;    Privately, aides to Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis say they believe that Mr. Wright will step aside from his convention role if his situation worsens. &quot;Wright would in no way embarrass the nominee of the party,&quot; a Dukakis adviser said. &quot;He wouldn't give the Republicans that satisfaction.&quot;    Responding with a barrage of appearances that began even before the ethics panel announced its unanimous decision, the speaker denied any wrongdoing, released a 23-page statement with a dozen attachments and repeatedly called for a quick resolution.    Some of the matters under investigation probably can be disposed of quickly. An allegation by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) suggested that Mr. Wright benefited financially from interceding with the Interior Department for Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corp. in 1979. But that was based on a news account that incorrectly said that Mr. Wright owned stock in the company. Mr. Gingrich already has informally retracted that charge.    Other matters will take time to investigate properly, including Mr. Wright's 1979 investments with members of the oil-rich Moncrief family in two East Texas gas wells. At the time, Mr. Wright was lobbying both the U.S. and Egyptian governments in an unsuccessful attempt to save Moncrief oil investments in the Israeli-occupied Sinai, which was being returned to Egypt as part of the Camp David peace accords.    Mr. Wright always has insisted that his gas-well investments weren't a reward for his lobbying. Friday he said that he risked more than $65,000 of his own money in the gas ventures, which he said netted him relatively little money. Still to be addressed is where Mr. Wright found such a large sum to put into risky ventures while earning a congressman's salary.    The ethics inquiry also covers &quot;possible use of undue influence&quot; by Mr. Wright when he contacted federal regulators on behalf of Texas developers and savings-and-loan executives, including Democratic campaign donors. Mr. Wright says that he was just helping constituents.    The inquiry covers Mr. Wright's use of a Fort Worth condominium owned by the son of a business associate. The congressman paid $21.67 a day, charged only for the time he used the apartment, which he counted as his official residence. Mr. Wright argues that the apartment would have been vacant if he hadn't used it.    Investigators face conflicting accounts of the preparation of Mr. Wright's 1985 book, &quot;Reflections of a Public Man.&quot; His former speechwriter Matthew Cossolotto says that he was assigned to assemble and edit the volume as part of his official duties, but Mr. Wright insists that the aide volunteered. &quot;He asked to be permitted to help,&quot; Mr. Wright said in his 23-page statement.    The inquiry seeks to determine if the book profits amounted to improper conversion of campaign funds to personal use; the publisher received more than $250,000 from Wright political committees in 1985 and 1986. Mr. Wright said that he gave the ethics committee 14 years' worth of invoices reflecting payments to the publisher for campaign work.    A more troublesome area, which the ethics committee hasn't specifically addressed, is whether the book, for which Mr. Wright received unusually large royalties, was a cover for improper gifts. Mr. Wright denies it. &quot;That's not the purpose of the book,&quot; he said on CBS-TV's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; yesterday. But Fort Worth developer Gene Payte says that he bought 1,000 copies of the volume to aid Mr. Wright financially.    &quot;I feel Jim Wright has been a very effective representative for our district,&quot; he said in telephone interview yesterday. &quot;I just wanted to reciprocate, and I bought his books.&quot; Mr. Payte said he gave away all but about a dozen copies to friends and business associates. His role was reported in yesterday's editions of the New York Times.    House rules forbid members from accepting gifts exceeding $100 from anyone with a direct interest in legislation. As reported earlier, the Teamsters union, lobbyist John White and the Washington representative of a Texas pipeline company each purchased 1,000 copies, netting Mr. Wright $3.25 for each copy of the $5.95 book. Mr. Payte denied having any interest in legislation himself, but said of his own purchase, &quot;Some might construe it as a gift.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
