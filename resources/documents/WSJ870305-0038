The relevant excerpts of the Tower Commission report, reprinted alongside, are an excellent short summary of how the terrorist issue deflected and ultimately destroyed larger geopolitical considerations. (See: &quot;The Tower Report: What Was Wrong&quot; -- WSJ March 4, 1987.)    This difficult problem has perplexed many democratic leaders, here and abroad. Ross Perot, speaking awhile back on &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer&quot; of the money he'd put up to get U.S. hostages out of Lebanon, said this was a process he'd been involved in through four presidents back to 1969.    The most complete narrative from previous presidencies appears in Gary Sick's &quot;All Fall Down,&quot; his inside account of the Carter presidency's fateful Iranian hostage crisis. Mr. Sick, at the time a State Department official working with Deputy Secretary Warren Christopher, explains how the Carter administration tried to free the hostages by offering some $150 million in arms Iran had ordered under the shah. &quot;For President Carter, who had excoriated the regime in Tehran as 'terrorists,'&quot; he writes, &quot;the exchange of large quantities of military equipment for the hostages would be personally distasteful and embarrassing.&quot;    In September 1980, Mr. Sick drew up a list of previously paid-for military items to trade. &quot;Many of the items would be of little value to the Iranian air force, but others could potentially be quite important. After nearly two hours of discussion a draft message was prepared for President Carter's approval offering a military package of about $150 million that would be made available on release of the hostages.&quot; After briefing security adviser Brzezinski, Mr. Sick sent the proposal to Mr. Carter at Camp David. &quot;The president approved the draft and it was sent out that evening.&quot; And in his presidential debate that October, President Carter proclaimed, &quot;If the hostages are released safely . . . we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns.&quot; The Ayatollah Khomeini never bothered to reply. Incidentally, the secretary of state at the time was Edmund Muskie.    The anti-terrorist campaign, especially pushed by Secretary of State George Shultz, was tempting as a means of building public support for an activist policy. But it had two drawbacks. As the record shows, it is difficult to stick a policy of never negotiating. There are circumstances when the U.S., to achieve its own objectives, would wish to talk to terrorists privately. Even more importantly, anti-terrorism simply is not the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy.    To understand the roots of this confusion, consider the State Department's official list of terrorist states. Its members until 1982 were Iraq, Libya, Syria and South Yemen. Iraq came off in 1982. Iran went on in 1984 and Cuba the next year. One country, however, is not now and never has been on State's terror list -- the Soviet Union. This is a little like entering a cage to battle five particularly aggressive squirrels and failing to notice the large tiger in the corner.    Worse, it distorts the way policy makers and their public audiences view events in the world. Individual events become media melodramas that take nearly everyone's eye off larger geostrategic principles and goals. Iran isn't just a bunch of crazy mullahs who rage at the Great Satan and give crazy people in Lebanon money to kidnap Westerners. Iran is strategically vital, to the West and to the Soviet Union. Ronald Reagan knows this, but he allowed the lesser hostage problem to impede and destroy the more important objective, which the Tower report affirms was on the table before policy turned into fiasco.    In this respect, Mr. Reagan is culpable, but it is clear that culpability for his preoccupation is shared, indeed, shared throughout the society he heads. </TEXT></DOC>
