Resolution 598 and the cease-fire with Iraq were &quot;more deadly to me than poison.&quot; The aged leader would not reveal why he had chosen to swallow his dose of hemlock, but he said that the decision was based on recommendations he had received from his country's military and political leaders.    The abrupt turnaround would appear to be the result of two main factors: a shortage of arms, and a shift in the power balance in the Iranian military hierarchy. According to Aharon Levran, editor of The Middle East Military Balance, an annual survey published by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, the Iranian armed forces appear to have reached their &quot;red line&quot; in terms of military supplies. Other Middle Eastern military experts echo Mr. Levran's comments, saying that the Iranians now have neither the quantity nor the quality of armaments to continue fighting against Iraq's expanding and improving army.    Most of the experts attribute this rundown in Iranian war materiel to the U.S. -- which has been engaged in a world-wide effort to halt arms sales to Iran. The American program, popularly called &quot;Operation Staunch,&quot; began in 1983. It was severely undermined by the Iran-Contra affair, but international arms dealers say that it picked up momentum in the past year and its effects are now being felt.    According to Israeli arms dealer Yaakov Nimrodi, who gained notoriety during the Iran-Contra investigation, the U.S. has managed to stop virtually all new arms sales to Iran. Other arms dealers say that Mr. Nimrodi is exaggerating and that the North Koreans, for example, have continued to supply Tehran with weapons. But all say that the total amount of weaponry supplied to Iran by foreign sources has certainly dropped drastically in the past four months. Mr. Nimrodi claims, for example, that even China, which had provided Silkworm missiles, has virtually dropped out of the market.    The arms dealers say that U.S. pressure on both private arms dealers and weapons-exporting nations has been extremely intense. &quot;One by one, private dealers have had to stop selling,&quot; a Swiss-based arms merchant said. In some cases, the dealers feared a cutoff in supplies from companies or countries the U.S. had warned off. In other cases, the dealers simply were out of stock and could not get fresh materiel from their traditional suppliers. The local Iranian arms industry was incapable of making up the shortfall.    &quot;The Iraqis now have the ability to escalate the war without Iran having an appropriate way of responding,&quot; says Mr. Levran.    Furthermore, according to both Western and Middle East military experts, the weapons that have been available to Iran recently were not very sophisticated -- certainly not enough to cope with the very advanced weapons systems Iraq was able to buy in both the East and the West.    Amatsia Baram, a University of Haifa-based expert on the Persian Gulf region, claims that when the cease-fire was agreed to, Iran had no anti-aircraft missiles left in its arsenal, and only 40 serviceable fighter aircraft. The Iraqi air force, by contrast, has over 600 planes. &quot;Iran's original strategy was to try to wage a war of attrition -- with occasional frontal attacks across the border,&quot; says Mr. Baram. &quot;Now, though, they are finding that it is they who are being ground down. With no air cover, their entire industrial infrastructure is presently at risk.&quot;    The first evidence of Iran's increasingly straitened position came to light in February when the Iraqis began a series of bold cross-border assaults and raids. The attacks started with the recapture of the island of Fao, and continued with armored raids that sometimes reached as far as 18 to 25 miles inside Iran. The incursions apparently rang alarm bells in Tehran. The Pasdaran, or Revolutionary Guards, were no longer fighting to the last man.    Several senior Israeli analysts say that Ayatollah Khomeini's decision is a victory of the Iranian army over the Pasdaran. Up to now, the poorly trained but highly motivated Pasdaran had been in control of the fighting at the front.    These analysts and the arms dealers are convinced that Iran will use the expected cease-fire to retrain and re-equip. The arms dealers in particular say they anticipate that Iran will go on an arms-buying spree. &quot;Once a measure of quiet returns to the region,&quot; says one dealer, &quot;the U.S. will undoubtedly let up its pressure against the sale of new arms.&quot;    The forthcoming period of reassessment and re-equipping, however, is not expected to result in a lessening of Iran's revolutionary fervor. &quot;We are refilling our batteries,&quot; the ayatollah said in his statement this week -- and then promised to settle accounts with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel.    &quot;I think that what we are seeing is a replay of the Russian Revolution,&quot; says Mr. Baram. &quot;Khomeini is the new Lenin. Montazari is the new Trotsky. And Rafsanjani is the new Stalin. Just as with the Bolshevik revolution, the three will now work at trying to consolidate the revolution from within, strengthening the army and helping underground movements abroad, especially in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon.&quot;    ---   Mr. Lederman is based in Jerusalem, where he formerly was a National Public Radio correspondent. </TEXT></DOC>
