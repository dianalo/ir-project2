(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The inner workings of PTL founder JimBakker's televangelism empire will provide the backdrop for thefederal tax evasion trial of two of his former aides that opensWednesday.   Brothers David and James Taggart are accused of diverting about$1.1 million in PTL money to pay their personal expenses, including$55,000 for items bought at the exclusive Cartier jewelry store inNew York.   The defendants were known for extravagant purchases and theirwardrobes included mink coats and designer clothes. They bought a$660,000 condominium on Fifth Avenue in New York and a $317,000 homein southeast Charlotte. In 1986, they gave each other Jaguars forChristmas at a cost of nearly $90,000.   The Taggarts were indicted in December on charges they evadedabout $494,000 in income taxes from 1983-87. The indictment came outthe same day that Bakker and his former top aide, Richard Dortch,were indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud.   Bakker and Dortch's trial on charges of diverting more than $4million of PTL money to their own use and conspiring to defraud PTLcontributors is scheduled to open Aug. 28 in Charlotte. However, ahearing will be held Wednesday to decide whether to move their trialbecause of extensive national and local publicity.   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor wanted to conduct the hearing behindclosed doors, but several news organizations appealed his decision.On June 27, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Richmond ruled the hearing should be open.   Dortch is also trying to get a separate trial. Taylor may rule onthat motion Wednesday.   The witness list for the Taggarts' trial looks like a ``Who'sWho'' of televangelism, as Justice Department attorneys David Brownand Joseph Bender may call evangelists Jerry Falwell, John WesleyFletcher, Rex Humbard and Rex Humbard Jr.   Defense attorney Ben Cotten's witnesses could include Bakker'sdaughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, and a former PTL board member, the Rev.Aimee Cortese.   Cotten has said he believed the Taggarts' lifestyles and theirrelationship with Bakker would be the focus of the case.   ``If I were the government, I would try to stress that thesepeople live high on the hog, and now it's time to pay the piper,''he told the Charlotte Observer.   But Cotten insisted his clients are innocent.   ``There never was an intent to do anything,'' he said. ``There'sno question some taxes may be owed. The question is how and why thatcame about. That's what this case is going to be about.''   Prosecutors argue that David Taggart, 32, who was Bakker'spersonal aide, and James Taggart, 35, PTL's former interiordecorator, used PTL credit cards to get large cash advances. Theindictment alleged they used the cash to pay personal bills.   Prosecutors allege the Taggarts also used blank PTL checks to payAmerican Express bills, and that two of those checks totaled $95,000.   During jury selection, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter asked 48potential jurors more than 80 questions, including whether they werefamiliar with brand names such as Gucci, Jaguar, Cartier andMercedes-Benz. He also asked if they used credit cards, checks orcash to pay for purchases and if they shopped in ``fine stores.''   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 30 years inprison and face fines totaling $1.35 million.</TEXT></DOC>
