The technical-services concern said it would receive a hearing by the Army on the proposed debarment within 30 days. The action, if carried out, would allow DynCorp to complete its existing government contracts, but preclude the contracts from being extended or expanded and would bar the company from receiving any new ones.    DynCorp received about one-third of its $749.1 million in 1986 revenue from federal contracts. The company said it couldn't determine the financial impact of a debarment, however.    The subsidiary, Dynalectric Co., and the unit's former president, G.W. Walther Ewalt, were convicted in April in a federal court in Atlanta. The charges involved rigging bids on electrical work for a federally-funded sewage plant in Georgia in 1979.    An Army spokesman confirmed that debarment proceedings against DynCorp had begun, but noted that the government still may decide either not to bar the company, or to extend the contract prohibition for only a limited period. Most debarments of federal contractors last no more than three years. </TEXT></DOC>
