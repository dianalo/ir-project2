It pioneered laser xerographic printing in 1971; designed a high-resolution, bit-map workstation incorporating icons, windows, pull-down menus and a mouse optical pointer by 1973; developed the industry-standard local-area network, Ethernet, in 1975; and developed Interpress, a page-description language that standardizes the interface between workstations and printers, in 1980.    PARC has set new standards in the design of high-power, solid-state lasers; its methodology for designing integrated circuits is used and taught in every university in the world; and throughout this decade, the center has been a world leader in the design and development of artificial-intelligence software for applications ranging from spell checking to computer programming and industrial design.    David T. Kearns   Chairman   Xerox Corp.   Stamford, Conn.</TEXT></DOC>
