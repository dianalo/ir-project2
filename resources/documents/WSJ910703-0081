Only a few months ago the company predicted it would showa profit for the quarter. But Chairman Michael J. O'Donnellsaid he is confident the company's cost-cutting efforts willeventually pay off, and he predicted a first-quarter profit.</LP><TEXT>   For the fourth quarter ended April 30, the computersoftware and systems company posted a net loss of $1.1million, or 13 cents a share, compared to a year-earlierprofit of $1.5 million, or 16 cents a share. Revenue fell 20%to $47 million from $58.4 million.   For the year, Ultimate posted a loss of $42.4 million, or$4.74 a share, against a profit of $125,000, or one cent ashare, the year before. Revenue fell 12% to $185.6 millionfrom $209.7 million.   The announcement jolted Ultimate's stock, which closed at$4, down 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading.   Ultimate blamed the loss on what it called an &quot;unexpected&quot;$5.4 million in nonrecurring year-end charges required by thecompany's auditors. The bulk of the charges will bolster thecompany's receivables reserves for its aging hardware supplybusiness. Ultimate also took a $3.5 million charge to accountfor tax changes related to the downsizing of its Australianoperations.   The quarterly loss came despite predictions made lastFebruary by Mr. O'Donnell that the company would post&quot;slightly better&quot; results than the third quarter's earningsof $2 million, or 22 cents a share. Mr. O'Donnell said at thetime that he was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about the future ofthe firm. He said the company had mostly completed itstransition to software and services from the computerhardware supply business and said in the meantime, &quot;We aren'tgoing to lose money.&quot;   In an interview yesterday, Mr. O'Donnell said Ultimate'sauditors, Coopers andamp; Lybrand, demanded the charges because itnoted that many of the company's traditional customers weresmaller, less-capitalized businesses likely to be hurt by therecession. &quot;They're looking at it from the perspective ofprudence and caution. Personally, I believe it's extreme andthe company doesn't agree with them,&quot; said Mr. O'Donnell.Ultimate said that without the additional reserves forreceivables, it would have had operating profit of $2million.   The company said the revenue decline from last year'srecord high reflected recessionary demand and discontinuedunprofitable business lines at the end of the second quarter.In the second quarter, Ultimate cut its work force 25% andtook $42 million in charges related to its restructuringefforts.   Mr. O'Donnell said the restructuring efforts have reducedexpenses by more than $20 million a year.</TEXT></DOC>
