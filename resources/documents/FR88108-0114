L. 98-620, 42 U.S.C. 10701, <T3>et seq.,</T3> the Institute is authorized to award grants, cooperativeagreements, and contracts to State and local courts, nonprofit organizations,and others for the purpose of improving the administration and qualityof justice in the State courts of the United States. Approximately $10million will be available for award in FY 1988. The Institute's fundingprogram is governed by the SJI Grant Guideline published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 52 FR 26208 (July 13, 1987). Copies are availablefrom the Institute.The program guideline proposed for comment below is primarily intendedto set forth the Institute's Special Interest Program Areas for FY 1988.The proposed guideline would revise all or a portion of the following sectionsof the Grant Guideline: ``Summary''; section I (``Background''); sectionII (``Special Interest Program Areas''); section V (``Types of Projects/Amountsof Award''); section VI (``Concept Paper Submission Requirements''); sectionVII (``Application Review Procedures''); section VIII (``Compliance Requirements'');section IX (``Application Requirements''); section XI (``Financial Requirements'');and section XIII (``Grant Adjustments'').For the sake of clarity, the Summary and sections II, V, VI, VII, and IXB., C., D. and E. are published in full below. Only the proposed changesin the other sections are set forth. Unless expressly changed below, allprovisions of the Grant Guideline apply to the FY 1988 award process.The proposed FY 1988 SJI grant program will be substantially similar tothe FY 1987 program. All parties seeking financial assistance from theInstitute will be required to submit concept papers. The Institute's Boardof Directors will invite formal applications from those parties submittingthe most promising concept papers. Awards will be made on the basis ofa competitive review of the applications received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Changes for FY 1988</ITAG>Three major changes are proposed in the Program Guideline: (1) Institutefunds will be awarded in one round of funding rather than the two conductedin FY 1987; (2) several new Special Interest categories will be added andothers revised or eliminated; and (3) a portion of available funds willbe allocated for projects that address a critical need in a locality, buthave little or no replicability nationally.Under the proposed timetable for FY 1988 grants, concept papers would bedue on April 11, 1988. Following the Board's review of the papers in earlyJune, applications would be due in mid-July. Funding decisions are expectedto be made by the Board in late August.The most significant changes to be made in the list of Special Interestareas are as follows:The ``judicial career enhancement'' program area would be eliminated;The ``domestic violence'' and ``victim/witness'' special interest areaswould be combined into one area, with greater emphasis on child sexualabuse;The ``alternative dispute resolution'' (ADR) area would be focused on evaluationof the impact of ADR programs on court workload and the quality of justice;andThe impact of AIDS on the courts, courthouse security, the future of thecourts, and the unique problems of the nation's largest urban trial courtswould be added as new Special Interest categories.In addition, the Board proposes to set aside a portion of the grant fundsto support projects that address a critical need of a single State or localcourt but that may not be transferable to other jurisdictions. Commentis specifically invited on this proposal and on how large a portion ofavailable funds should be set aside for such projects.Other changes in emphasis have been made, and illustrative examples ofpossible topics have been added in some areas. The guideline has also beenrevised to set forth criteria for continuation funding, to explain theroles of the Board and the staff in the review process, to clarify thatmaterials and services developed under Institute grants should be disseminatedas widely and at as low a cost as possible, and to require prior Instituteapproval of changes in key project staff.In addition to these changes in the guideline, the Institute is publishing:(1) Its plans to define more specifically its role in the area of judicialeducation, and (2) grantwriting recommendations to potential applicants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Judicial Education</ITAG>During FY 1988, the Institute plans to conduct an in-depth assessment ofwhat its role should be in the area of judicial education and training.The Board of Directors believes that the Institute is uniquely situatedto assure that existing national and State judicial educators deliver,in the most effective manner possible, education and training that addressesthe topics of greatest concern to judges, court managers and other courtpersonnel around the country. In seeking to meet that objective in itsfirst year of activity, the Board found that many judicial educators presentedsimilar ideas for meeting a variety of needs, but had not actively coordinatedwith each other to minimize unnecessary duplication or cost. In an effortto increase coordination among education providers, the Institute awardedgrants to establish a Judicial Education Network and a judicial educationnewsletter, and funded several joint projects proposed by judicial educators.Judicial education proposals accounted for over one-third of the conceptpapers received by the Institute in FY 1987. The volume of these proposals,and their diversity, have led the Board to consider a number of possiblealternatives to the funding approach used in FY 1987. Should, for example,a fixed, or a maximum or minimum percentage of grant funds be allocatedto judicial education and training? Should a certain share of that allocationgo to national providers and a certain share to State providers? Shouldfunds be awarded to sustain the operations of major educational organizations,or should those organizations be required to develop innovative specificprojects for funding consideration every year? Should a share of the Institute'sfunds be awarded on a formula basis to State judicial educators for thepurpose of sending court personnel to out-of-State training they wouldotherwise be unable to attend?In order to determine how the Institute can most effectively use its fundsin this important area, the Board has developed an approach that woulddraw on the expertise of objective, independent experts and the views ofthe judicial educators themselves. The Institute plans to contract withthree persons who will provide the Board independent assessments of the``state of judicial education'' and the needs of educators, judges, andcourt personnel. They will address their task from three perspectives:one will be a judge with substantial experience as a ``consumer'' of judicialeducation; one will have substantial experience as a judicial educator;and one will be well-versed in adult education techniques.The Institute envisions entering into these contracts in early 1988, withthe expectation that, during the summer, each contractor will provide a``white paper'' for the Board's consideration. Every major judicial educationprovider will have an opportunity to provide each contractor with a completestatement of its history, mission, activities, and goals, as well as itsviews about SJI's role. The Board will consider these papers at a meetingin the fall of 1988, and will formulate its policies in the judicial educationarea for inclusion in the FY 1989 Program Guideline. Public comment isspecifically invited on the Board's proposed approach to defining the Institute'srole in judicial education.In the interim, no major revisions are being made in the education andtraining section of the FY 1988 Program Guideline. The section has beenmodified, however, to emphasize that judicial education and training programs``should apply innovative approaches to training which employ well-definedadult education techniques; sound methods for evaluating the effectivenessof the training; and new or revised curricula on key topics of concernto the judiciary.''Public comment is invited on all the special interest categories proposedfor FY 1988 as well as the focus and scope of the issues presented.<ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendations to Grantwriters</ITAG>In Fiscal Year 1987, Institute staff reviewed over 325 concept papers.On the basis of those reviews, inquiries from applicants, and the viewsof the Board, the Institute would like to offer recommendations to helppotential applicants present workable, understandable proposals that canmeet the funding criteria set forth in this guideline. The Institute suggeststhat applicants consider the following questions in developing conceptpapers:1. <T3>What is the problem you wish to address?</T3> Describe the problemand how it affects the courts and the public; discuss how your approachwill rectify the situation or advance the state-of-the-art or knowledge;and explain why it is the most appropriate approach to take.2. <T3>What do you want to do?</T3> The purpose of a project should be statedin simple, straightforward terms. To the greatest extent possible, an applicantshould avoid a specialized vocabulary which is not readily understood bythe general public. Technical or academic jargon does not enhance a paper.3. <T3>How will you do it?</T3> All proposed tasks should be set forth sothat a reviewer can see a logical progression of tasks and relate thosetasks directly to accomplishment of the project's goals. When in doubtabout whether to provide a more detailed explanation or to assume a particularlevel of knowledge or expertise on the part of the reviewers, err on theside of caution and provide the additional information. A description ofproject tasks will also help identify necessary budget items. All staffpositions and project costs should relate directly to the tasks described.4. <T3>How will you know it works?</T3> Many concept papers did not presenta defined plan for determining whether the proposed training, procedure,service, or technology accomplished the objective it was designed to meet.Every project design should include an evaluation component which describesthe specific measures that will be used to evaluate the project's effectivenessand identify program elements which will require further modification.The description should include how the evaluation will be conducted, whenit will occur during the project period, who will conduct it, and whatthe evaluation criteria will be. In most instances, the evaluation shouldbe conducted by persons not connected with the performance or administrationof the project.5. <T3>How will others find out about it?</T3> Every project design shouldinclude a plan to disseminate the results of the training, research, ordemonstration beyond the jurisdictions and individuals directly affectedby the project. The plan should identify the specific methods which willbe used to inform the field about the project, such as the publicationof law review or journal articles, presentations at appropriate conferences,or the distribution of key materials. It is not sufficient to say thata report or research findings ``will be made available to'' the field.The specific means of distribution or dissemination should be identified.Reproduction and dissemination costs are allowable budget items.6. <T3>What are the specific costs involved?</T3> The budget for the projectshould be clearly presented and well justified. As presented in 3. above,the budgeted figures should relate directly to the various tasks of theproject. Major budget categories such as personnel, benefits, travel, supplies,and equipment should be clearly identified. If indirect costs are to beapplied to the project, a brief description of the proposed indirect costrate should be included. Generally, an outline of costs involved and thebasis used for determining those costs is sufficient for a concept paper.<ITAG tagnum="84">Charges for Grant-Related Products</ITAG>The development of some type of product is a requirement of every Institutegrant. Although some projects include dissemination of key materials orproducts in their design, this is not currently an Institute requirement.It would be a heavy financial burden for the Institute to bear the costsof reproduction and dissemination of all key materials developed with theassistance of Institute funds; however, the Institute encourages granteesto make grant-related products easily accessible to the courts communityand other interested parties. Consequently, the Institute has adopted thefollowing policy governing charges for products developed in connectionwith Institute grants:1. When Institute funds fully cover the cost of developing, producing,and disseminating a product, the document or software should be distributedto the field without charge.2. When Institute funds only partially cover the development, production,and dissemination costs, the grantee may recover its out-of-pocket expensesfrom those requesting the material.In addition, consistent with the standard government policy adopted inthe SJI Grant Guideline, grantees are permitted to copyright materialsand retain royalties subject to reservation by the Institute of a royalty-free,nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, use, and authorizeothers to use the materials for purposes consistent with the legislationunder which the grant was authorized.<ITAG tagnum="85">Contact Persons for State Agencies Administering Institute Grantsto State and Local Courts. </ITAG>The Institute would appreciate receiving updated information regardingthe name, title, address and telephone number of the person designatedby the State Supreme Court to be responsible for overseeing the administrationof Institute grants awarded to the courts of the State. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed State Justice Institute Program Guideline </ITAG>The following FY 1988 Program Guideline is proposed for public comment:Summary This guideline sets forth the programmatic, financial, and administrativerequirements of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts awarded bythe State Justice Institute. The Institute, a private nonprofit corporationestablished by an Act of Congress, is authorized to award grants, cooperativeagreements and contracts to State and local courts and their agencies;national nonprofit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunctionwith, and serving the judicial branch of State governments; and nationalnonprofit organizations for the education and training of judges and supportpersonnel of the judicial branch of State governments. The Institute may also award funds to other nonprofit organizations withexpertise in judicial administration; institutions of higher education;individuals, partnerships, firms, or corporations; and private agencieswith expertise in judicial administration if the objectives of the fundedprogram can be better served by such an entity. Funds may also be awardedto Federal, State or local local agencies and institutions other than courtsfor services that cannot be provided for adequately through nongovernmentalarrangements. Approximately $10 million is available for grants, contracts, and cooperativeand cooperative agreements from FY 1988 appropriations. The Institute mayalso provide financial assistance in the form of interagency agreementswith other grantors. The Institute will consider applications for fundingsupport that address any of the areas specified in its enabling legislation;however, the Board of Directors of the Institute has designated certainprogram categories as being of special interest. The Institute has established one round of competition for FY 1988 funds,with a concept paper submission deadline of April 11, 1988. This guidelineapplies to concept papers and formal applications submitted for FY 1988funding. The awards made by the State Justice Institute are governed by the requirementsof this guideline and the authority conferred by Pub. L. 98-620, TitleII, 42 U.S.C. 10701, <T3>et seq</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="84">I.

Scope of the Program</ITAG>During FY 1988, the Institute will consider applications for funding supportthat address any of the areas specified in its enabling legislation. TheBoard has, however, designated certain program categories as being of ``specialinterest.'' See section II.B.<T3>A. Authorized Program Areas</T3>The State Justice Institute Act authorizes the Institute to fund projectsaddressing one or more of the following program areas:1. Assistance to State and local court systems in establishing appropriateprocedures for the selection and removal of judges and other court personneland in determining appropriate levels of compensation; 2. Education and training programs for judges and other court personnelfor the performance of their general duties and for specialized functions,and national and regional conferences and seminars for the disseminationof information on new developments and innovative techniques;3. Research on alternative means for using judicial and nonjudicial personnelin court decisonmaking activities, implementation of demonstration programsto test such innovative approaches, and evaluations of their effectiveness;4.

Studies of the causes of trial and appellate court delay in resolvingcases, and establishing and evaluating experimental programs for reducingcase processing time;9. Development and testing of methods for measuring the performance ofjudges and courts and experiments in the use of such measures to improvethe functioning of judges and the courts;10. Studies of court rules and procedures, discovery devices, and evidentiarystandards to identify problems with the operation of such rules, procedures,devices, and standards; and the development of alternative approaches tobetter reconcile the requirements of due process with the need for swiftand certain justice, and testing of the utility of those alternative approaches;11. Studies of the outcomes of cases in selected areas to identify instancesin which the substance of justice meted out by the courts diverges frompublic expectations of fairness, consistency, or equity; and the development,testing and evaluation of alternative approaches to resolving cases insuch problem areas;12. Support for programs to increase court responsiveness to the needsof citizens through citizen education, improvement of court treatment ofwitnesses, victims, and jurors, and development of procedures for obtainingand using measures of public satisfaction with court processes to improvecourt performance;13. Testing and evaluating experimental approaches to provide increasedcitizen access to justice, including processes which reduce the cost oflitigating common grievances and alternative techniques and mechanismsfor resolving disputes between citizens; and14. Others programs, consistent with the purposes of the Act, as may bedeemed appropriate by the Institute, including projects dealing with therelationship between Federal and State court systems in areas where thereis concurrent State-Federal jurisdiction and where Federal courts, directlyor indirectly, review State court proceedings.Funds will <T3>not</T3> be made available for the ordinary, routine operation of courtsystems in any of these areas.B. Special Interest Program Areas<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Description</ITAG>The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programsof proven merit that can be replicated in other jurisdictions. Althoughapplications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for fundingin FY 1988, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projectsthat:(a) Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existingarrangements to improve the courts;(b) Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special needof serious attention;(c) Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicability;and(d) Either develop products that are easily available to and transferableamong State and local courts, or provide technical assistance to transfereffective programs and procedures in any of the ``special interest'' categoriesto other State and local jurisdictions.A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meetsthe four criteria set forth above and (1) it falls within the scope ofthe ``special interest'' program areas designated below or (2) informationcoming to the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliatedorganizations, the research literature, or other sources demonstrates thatthe project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific Categories</ITAG>The Board has designated the areas set forth below as ``Special Interest''program categories. The order of listing does not imply any ordering ofpriorities among the categories.a.<T3> Education and Training for Judges and Other Key Court Personnel.</T3>This category includes the improvement of existing court education programs;the preparation of State court education plans to ensure a comprehensivetraining program and the effective allocation of limited court educationresources; and the development of quality in-service and pre-service trainingprograms and materials that transform ideas and communicate content insuch a way that the performance of judges and/or court personnel is substantivelyimproved.Court education programs should apply innovative approaches to trainingwhich employ well-defined adult education techniques; sound methods forevaluating the effectiveness of the training; and new or revised curriculaon key topics of concern to the judiciary, such as those identified inthe SJI Special Interest categories and other topics that judges and courtpersonnel themselves have identified as important.b. <T3>Alternative Dispute Resolution.</T3> This category includes the evaluationof new and existing dispute resolution procedures and programs that havea substantial likelihood of resolving disputes more fairly, more expeditiouslyand less expensively than the traditional court process, with particularemphasis on the impact of those procedures and programs on the qualityof justice provided and on court workload and case processing.c. <T3>The Future and the Courts.</T3> This category includes research onthe changing demands and circumstances that will face the courts in the21st century, and the modifications that may be needed in court organization,financing, procedures, services, personnel, and facilities to respond tothose demands and circumstances.d. <T3>Application of Technology. </T3>This category includes the testingof innovative applications of technology to improve the operation of courtmanagement systems and judicial practices at both the trail and appellatecourt levels, including, e.g., the publication of a court technology bulletinto assist judges and court managers in selecting technology appropriateto a court's needs; assessment of the usefulness of on-bench computer terminals;establishment and assessment of electronic bulletin boards for judges andother court personnel; and local experiments with promising but untestedapplications of technology in the courts (See paragraph XI.H.2.b. regardingthe limits on the use of grant funds to purchase equipment and software.)e. <T3>Jury System Management. </T3>This catgegory includes the development,implement and evaluation of legal and administrative procedures relatingto jurors to ensure the representativeness of the juror pool, clarify juryinstructions, expedite the jury selection and empanelment process withoutaffecting fairness, and otherwise reduce the cost and enhance the fairnessof the jury process. f. <T3>Reduction of Litigation Expense and Delay. </T3>This category includesthe implementation and evaluation of innovative programs and proceduresdesigned to reduce substantially the expense and delay in civil, criminal,domestic relations, juvenile, and other types of litigation at the trialor appellate level or both, and the collection, compilation, and analysisof statistical data necessary for determining the causes of unnecessaryexpense and delay, isolating areas of concern, and evaluating the efficacyof solutions. g. <T3>Enforcement of Fines and Orders to Pay. </T3>This category includesthe implementation and evaluation of procedures for effectively imposing,collecting, and enforcing orders to pay fines, restitution, assessments,the cost of appointed or assigned counsel, and other obligations.  h. <T3>Implications of AIDS for the Courts. </T3>This category includes researchregarding the implications of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome for courtdecisions, procedures, and policies, including but not limited to suchmatters as pretrial release, sentencing, child custody, termination ofparental rights, and the right to and termination of medical treatment. i. <T3>Programs and Procedures for Victims and Witnesses. </T3>This categoryincludes the implementation and evaluation of innovative court-based programsand procedures for providing fairer treatment for victims of crimes andwitnesses in civil, criminal, domestic relations, juvenile and other typesof cases, including procedures for the fair, effective, and efficient handlingof domestic violence and child sexual abuse cases, the issuance and enforcementof protective orders, and the obtaining of testimony from children. j. <T3>Courthouse Security and Operation. </T3>This category includes theimplementation and evaluation of innovative techniques for improving courthousesecurity including methods for ensuring the safety of litigants, witnesses,counsel, court personnel and judges, other than through the hiring of additionalsecurity personnel or the purchase of alarm or other security systems. k. <T3>The Relationship Between State and Federal Courts. </T3>This categoryincludes research to develop creative ideas and procedures that could improvethe administration of justice in the State courts and at the same timereduce the work burdens of the Federal courts. Such research projects mightaddress innovative State court procedures for:  andbullet; Reducing the burdens attendant to Federal habeas corpus casesinvolving State convictions; andbullet; Handling civil, criminal, domestic relations or other types ofcases in which a party is also subject to a Federal bankruptcy proceeding;andbullet; Processing complex multistate litigation in the State courts;andbullet; Facilitating the adjudication of Federal law questions by Statecourts with appropriate opportunities for review; and andbullet; Otherwise allocating judicial burdens between and among Federaland State courts. Other areas of research would include studies examining the likely impactof the elimination or restriction of Federal diversity jurisdiction onthe State courts and the factors that motivate litigants to select theFederal or State courts in cases in which there is concurrent jurisdiction.l.<T3> Special Needs of the Largest Urban Courts.</T3> The Board is particularlyinterested in receiving concept papers from State or local court systemsregarding the implementation and evaluation of innovative programs andprocedures to address critical areas of need in the limited and generaljurisdiction trial courts serving the nation's largest cities (those witha population of at least 1,000,000 persons). Such programs might includethe development and testing of improved methods to assist those courtsin selecting, retaining and removing judges, or projects to relieve acuteproblems in the courts' ability to handle civil, criminal, domestic relations,juvenile and other types of cases in a fair and timely manner. The Boardwill consider awarding grants of up to $500,000 each to support projectsin this category.Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' areawill be accorded a preference in the rating process. (See the selectioncriteria listed in section VI_``Concept Paper Review Procedures'' and VII_``ApplicationReview Procedures''.)C. Programs Addressing a Critical Need of a Single State or Local Jurisdiction1. The Board has set aside a portion of available grant funds to supportState and local projects that do not meet the criteria regarding innovativeness,national significance, and transferability set forth in sections II.B.1.(a),(c), and (d). In Fiscal Year 1988, the Board will consider supporting alimited number of projects that fall within one of the ``Special Interest''categories set forth above, but that relate only to a single State or localjurisdiction.2. Concept papers and applications requesting funds for projects underthis section must meet the requirements of sections VI (``Concept PaperSubmission Requirements'') and VII (``Application Review Procedures'')of the Grant Guideline, respectively, and must demonstrate that:a. The proposed project is essential to meeting a critical need of thejurisdiction; andb. The need cannot be met with State and local resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Types of Projects and Amounts of Awards</ITAG>The Institute has placed no limitation on the overall number of awardsor the number of awards in each area of interest. The general types ofprojects are:A. Education and training;B. Research and evaluation;C. Demonstration; andD. Technical assistance.Except as specified below, concept papers and applications may requestfunding in amounts up to $300,000. Awards in excess of $200,000 are likelyto be rare and to be made, if at all, only for highly promising proposalsthat will have a significant impact nationally. A project addressing theneeds of the largest urban courts under Special Interest category 1. may,however, receive support of up to $500,000.Proposed grant periods for all projects should not exceed 24 months.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Concept Paper Submission Requirements</ITAG>Concept papers are an extremely important part of the application processbecause they enable the Institute to learn the program areas of primaryinterest to the courts and to explore innovative ideas, without imposingheavy burdens on prospective applicants. The use of concept papers alsopermits the Institute to better project the nature and amount of grantawards. Because of their importance, the Institute requires all partiesrequesting financial assistance from the Institute to submit concept papersprior to submitting a formal grant application. This requirement may bewaived by the Board only if it determines that extraordinary circumstancesexist to justify the waiver.A. Format and ContentConcept papers must be no more than 10 double-spaced pages on 8\1/2\ by11 inch paper. Margins should not be less than 1 inch. The papers shouldcontain:1. A title describing the proposed project;2. A brief indication of the statutory program area(s), and ``special interest''category(ies), if any, addressed by the paper;3. An explanation of the need for the project;4. A summary description of the approach to be taken;5. A summary description of how the project will be evaluated includingthe evaluation criteria;6. A description of the products that will result, the degree to whichthey will be applicable to courts across the nation, and the manner inwhich the products and results of the project will be disseminated;7. An explanation of the expected benefits to be derived from the project;8. The identity of the key staff (if known) and a summary description oftheir qualifications; 9. A preliminary budget estimate including the anticipated costs for personnel,fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, contracts, indirect costs,and other anticipated major expenditure categories; 10. The amount, nature (cash or non-cash), and source of match to be provided(see section VIII.C. below); and 11. A statement of whether financial assistance for the project has beenor will be sought from other sources. <T3>The Institute will not accept concept papers exceeding 10 pages. Thepage limit does not include letters of cooperation or endorsements. Additionalmaterial should not be attached unless it is essential to impart a clearunderstanding of the project. </T3>B. Special Requirements for Continuation Projects Concept papers requesting continued funding of SJI-supported projects maysummarize the needs to be addressed, statement of the approach, anticipatedproducts and benefits, and key staff descriptions if these elements areunchanged from those presented in the approved application. However, changesin any of these elements, the scope or focus or the project, or the intendedaudience must be fully explained. In addition, concept papers describingcontinuation projects must address the following: 1. Key findings or recommendations contained in the most recent evaluationof the project, if any, with an explanation of how the project will addressthem during the next project period; 2. The degree to which the courts community is using the service, training,or project, e.g., the number and types of court personnel trained, thenumber and types of requests for information, etc.; and 3. The reasons why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriateor unavailable. <T3>C. Selection Criteria </T3>1. All concept papers will be evaluated by the staff on the basis of thefollowing criteria: a. The demonstration of need for the project; b. The soundness and innovativeness of the approach described; c. The benefits to be derived from the project; and d. The reasonableness of the proposed budget. 2. ``Special Interest'' category concept papers submitted pursuant to sectionII.B will also be rated on the proposed project's relationship to one ofthe ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in that section, and thedegree to which the findings, procedures, training, technology, or otherresults of the project can be transferred to other jurisdictions. 3. ``Single jurisdiction'' concept papers submitted pursuant to sectionII.C. will be rated on the proposed project's relation to one of the ``SpecialInterest'' categories set forth in section II.B, and on the special requirementslisted in section II.C.2. 4. ``Continuation'' concept papers will also be rated on the followingcriteria: a. The uniqueness of the training, service, or project; b. The key findings or recommendations set forth in the most recent evaluationof the project, if any, and how they will be addressed during the nextproject period; c. The credibility of the training, project, or service within the courtscommunity; d. The effect of termination of the training, project, or service on therange of services needed by the State courts; and e. Significant changes in the scope or focus of the project, or key elementsof the project design. 5. In determining which concept papers will be selected for developmentinto full applications, the Institute will also consider the availabilityof financial assistance from other sources for the project, the amountand nature (cash of in-kind) of the submitter's anticipated match, andwhether the submitter is a ``priority applicant under the Institute's enablinglegislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1) and section IV above). <T3>D. Review Process </T3>Concept papers will be competitively reviewed by the Board of Directors.Institute staff will prepare a narrative summary of each paper, and a ratingsheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion. Committeesof the Board will review concept papers within assigned program areas andprepare recommendations to the full Board. The full Board of Directorswill then decide which concept paper applicants should be invited to submitformal applications for funding. The decision to invite an applicationis solely that of the Board of Directors. E. Submission Requirements An original and six copies of all concept papers submitted for considerationin Fiscal Year 1988 must be RECEIVED by the Institute on or before 5:30p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 11, 1988. All concept papers shouldbe sent to State Justice Institute, 120 S. Fairfax Street, Alexandria,Virginia 22314. Receipt of each concept paper will be acknowledged in writing. Extensionsof the deadline for receipt of concept papers will not be granted. The Board expects to meet in early June, 1988, to review the concept papersand invite applications. The Institute will send written notice to allpersons submitting concept papers of the Board's decisions regarding theirpapers. Applications invited by the Board will be due approximately 45days after the Board meeting. The Institute anticipates that Fiscal Year1988 funding decisions will be made by the Board in late August 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Application Review Procedures </ITAG>Except in extraordinary circumstances as specified in section VI, a formalapplication is to be submitted only upon invitation of the Board followingreview of a concept paper.
