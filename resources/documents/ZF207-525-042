ScheierandM;The biggest computer-security threat in most corporations today isn't avirus, a hacker or a phony cleaning crew that comes in at night and downloadscompany customer lists.andM;Rather, it's an employee who seems to be trustworthy, but who also is earningin the bottom 40 percent of the wage scale, agonizing over a divorce, nervousabout a corporate takeover or angry about a missed promotion, for example.andM;If such users steal enough, a company will probably fire them quietly andnever press charges to avoid the embarrassment.andP;  However, even if a firm'smanagers do decide to make an example of them, the district attorney may notprosecute the case because of a backlog of other, more violent crimes.andM;That scenario, which is rosy for computer criminals but gloomy for theirvictims, was painted by speakers at a computer-security conference lastmonth, sponsored by Digital Consulting Inc., an Andover, Mass., managementconsulting firm.andM;The best computer managers can hope for, they said, is to understand wherethe real threats are; build cost-effective defenses against them; and makesure they can detect crimes when they occur and recover from them quickly.andM;Viruses and hackers often make the headlines (see related story below), but&quot;the people who work for your firm are the problem,&quot; said Joseph Hootman,vice president of marketing for Enigma Logic Inc., a Concord, Calif., vendorof computer access-control software.andM;Robert Courtney Jr., a Kingston, N.Y., computer consultant, told the story ofclerks at an &quot;upscale&quot; department store who, &quot;for 10 cents on the dollar,&quot;erased the accounts of major customers who owed a total of $33 million.andM;Their method was to list those customers as &quot;bankrupt&quot; in the computersystem, causing the billing department to stop dunning them for backpayments.andP;  The customers' credit ratings weren't hurt because the&quot;bankruptcies&quot; were never filed in court.andM;At another firm, Courtney said, a systems analyst who didn't like her bossjuggled an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system so that vendors got thewrong checks.andP;  The estimated loss was $10.9 million.andP;  Publicizing such casescould scare away potential EDI partners, customers or lenders, said DonnParker, a senior management-systems consultant at SRI International, a MenloPark, Calif., research and consulting firm.andM;For this reason, many cases are settled &quot;over lunch,&quot; resulting in thevictim's agreeing to drop the case if the perpetrator keeps quiet, he said.andM;Courtney said his research shows that the more a perpetrator steals, the lesslikely it is he or she will be prosecuted.andP;  Victims have a &quot;social andethical&quot; responsibility to report such crimes, but they should getpublic-relations and legal advice to minimize the damage, said Parker.andM;Although there was much talk of encryption and passwords, &quot;security is stillin large part a management issue,&quot; said Al Novissimo, vice president ofdevelopment for Computer Associates International Inc., a Garden City, N.Y.,andO;software firm.andM;Courtney has argued for a corporate-security policy statement from topmanagement that specifies who is responsible for security.andP;  He suggestedgiving individual departments, rather than information-systems departments,the task of security because most employees steal from the parts of thecompany where they work.andM;Employee awareness and enforcement are also vital.andP;  A password does littlegood if employees tape it to the front of their PCs or, as one speakerrecounted, on the ceiling over their chairs.andM;Courtney noted that IBM makes it a condition of employment to follow securityprocedures.andM;Instant detection of computer crime is the &quot;new frontier&quot; in computersecurity, said Parker.andP;  His firm and others are working on software that canidentify abnormalities as they are happening and report them, inunderstandable form, to a network manager or security officer.andM;Because it's not cost-effective to completely protect computer systems,Parker stressed the importance of fast recovery from a break-in.andM;Justifying the costs of security measures can be difficult, because suchsteps mean spending money to prevent a problem that may never have hit acompany before.andP;  One speaker suggested asking the employees who buy insurancefor a company how they handle risk analysis, because some of the samecost-justification analyses might work for computer security.andM;Courtney's research shows that 65 percent of all data-processing securitylosses are caused by mistakes rather than by fraud.andM;But in the shadowy world of computer security, that's cold comfort.andP;  Alertemployees will notice that nobody caught their unintentional error, saidCourtney, making such mistakes &quot;a training ground for potentially dishonestemployees.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
