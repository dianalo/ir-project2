The view from Moscow is hardlythe picture of a massive Soviet-bloc advantage, as suggested by Westernofficials over the last several years. In the event of a war, the Sovietswould strive for surprise and speed moving westward. At the same time,they face an adversary which, in general, is technically more advanced,which spends more on military manpower and equipment, and which wouldhave the natural advantages of the defender. Moreover, the military activitiesof the Warsaw Pact are watched very carefully, and preparations for warwould be difficult or impossible to hide. A surprise Warsaw Pact assaultfrom a standing start would be extraordinarily risky, while the mobilizationof forces, even under the guise of an exercise, risks both telegraphingPact intentions and escalating an already tense situation. Both WTO andNATO observers are aware of the Pact's strengths. Unfortunately, theWest pays insufficient attention to the Pact's weaknesses.</TEXT></DOC>
