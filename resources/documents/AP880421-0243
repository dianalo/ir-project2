That is cause forconcern in the airline industry,'' said Rodney Wallis, associationsecurity director.   ``We now have the possibility that a number of trained hijackerscould lead missions of their own,'' Wallis told The AssociatedPress.   The 15-day-long hijacking ended Wednesday with the release of 31hostages. Algeria allowed the pro-Iranian hijackers to escape.   The terrorists, reportedly nine in number, had demanded thatKuwait release 17 pro-Iranian terrorists convicted and imprisonedfor bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in December1983.   Wallis noted that Algeria is not a signatory to theinternational convention on hijacking, which calls on authoritiesto secure the safe release of passengers, recovery of the aircraft,and apprehension or extradition of the hijackers.   Algeria succeeded in the first two parts but not the third.   ``There was a requirement for all three processes,'' saidWallis, a former executive at British Airways.   ``Our worries are now that you've got people who haveexperienced the seizure of an aircraft and the holding of hostagesover a lengthy period, and they are now back in circulation.''   He noted reports that the hijackers told some of their hostagesthat the plane seizure was only the first of a series of plannedhijackings.   The Algerians should have negotiated from strength since thehijacking had gone for so long and the terrorists must haverealized they could not achieve their goal, he added.   The International Air Transport Association, a trade associationrepresenting 170 international airlines and headquartered inMontreal, is investigating how the Kuwaiti aircraft was seizedwhile it was en route from Bangkok to Kuwait.   It has asked Thai authorities for permission to send a team toreview security operations at Bangkok airport, Wallis said. ``Weare awaiting a formal response.''   He said information received by the association indicatessecurity was lax on the day of the hijacking but there is ``nodefinitive conclusion as to where the weapons went on board.   The association has called for the establishment of aninternational court to try hijackers, an international detentioncenter to jail them, and an international force to negotiate withhijackers and to mount a rescue attempt if talks fail.</TEXT></DOC>
