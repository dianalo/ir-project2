Tests indicated EPA personnel were exposed to uranium oxide whenthey attended meetings at the Feed Materials Production Center inFernald, Ohio, EPA Regional Administrator Valdas Adamkus said in aletter obtained Tuesday by congressional investigators.   Adamkus ordered that no EPA personnel go to the site ``until thishealth risk can be satisfactorily addressed.''   The Ohio EPA followed suit Tuesday but characterized the move asa precaution since its periodic checks have not revealed a similarproblem.   The plant's operator said it believes the facility is safe andquestioned the accuracy of urine tests given to EPA employees. Itsaid it will try to demonstrate by the end of the week that its ownroutine testing program is accurate.   ``We don't know what lab EPA is using, but we have the utmostconfidence in our program,'' said William H. Kelley, spokesman forWestinghouse Materials of Ohio, the contractor operating the plantfor the U.S. Department of Energy.   A spokeswoman for Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste said the actionsreinforce the governor's desire ``to get an expert panel to lookinto the situation, a panel of the caliber of the one that lookedinto the (space shuttle) Challenger accident.''   The Fernald plant has been the subject of intense scrutiny byCongress and the press because of contamination problems andallegations that its radioactive and chemical discharges may haveharmed people who live and work nearby.   A long-range blueprint approved by President Reagan shortlybefore he left office targeted the deteriorating uranium foundry asthe first that should be closed as the government modernizes itsnetwork of nuclear bomb plants.   Adamkus discussed his order Tuesday at a meeting in Chicago withJoseph La Grone, the Energy Department's Oak Ridge OperationsManager, EPA spokeswoman Ann Rowan said.   The officials agreed to meet again on the subject but no date wasset and ``what we said in the letter still holds,'' she said.   Ohio EPA Director Richard Shank decided to make a similar ordercovering state EPA employees after meeting with the federalofficials in Chicago, spokesman Allan Franks said.   ``As a precautionary measure, we have ordered our people who doroutine work to stay away from the site until a regular monitoringsystem is set up,'' he said, adding that a state EPA safety healthofficer would set up the monitoring system ``as soon as possible.''   La Grone on Monday offered to have the Energy Department financenew urine tests ``to determine whether there is truly a potentialpersonnel exposure problem or in fact a laboratory problem.''   Adamkus' letter, dated Feb. 9, and La Grone's letter of responsewere obtained Tuesday by the investigative staff of Rep. Tom Luken,D-Ohio.   Luken said he was upset that the EPA didn't notify Fernaldworkers about the uranium oxide exposure threat.   ``The public is totally unprotected when the monitor bars its owninspectors from the premises,'' he said. ``If it's unsafe for EPAshouldn't it be off limits to everyone? It is scary.''   Kelley said workers at the plant in southwest Ohio, about 18miles from Cincinnati, were notified Tuesday of the EPA actions.   The plant, which processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons oras fuel for reactors, is the subject of a lawsuit on behalf of14,000 people who live or work nearby and believe their health hasbeen threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water.   Cincinnati attorney Stanley Chesley, an attorney in the $300million class-action lawsuit, called the latest development ``anexample of the ongoing trauma that continues to plague this plant.''   ``This is why we are so concerned about compensation to thevictims,'' he said. ``Every day there is another revelation.''</TEXT></DOC>
