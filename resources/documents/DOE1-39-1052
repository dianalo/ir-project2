<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-1052 </DOCNO><TEXT>The ATHENA computer program has many features that make it desirable touse as a space reactor evaluation tool. One of the missing features wasa surface-to-surface thermal radiation model. A model was developed thatallows any of the regular ATHENA heat slabs to radiate to any other heatslab. The view factors and surface emissivities must be specified bythe user. To verify that the model was properly accounting for radiantenergy transfer, two different types of test calculations were performed.Both calculations have excellent results. The updates have been usedon both the INEL CDC-176 and the Livermore Cray. 7 refs., 2 figs., 6tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
