This work is activelybeing carried out, at the international level, to develop suitable standards.However, voltage distortion, at a given point of a distribution network,depends not only on local harmonic current injection but also on thepropagation of harmonic currents generated elsewhere in the network.It follows that if a voltage distortion limit value is specified fora given network level, only part of it will be available for the disturbingloads supplied at that level, as a margin must be left for the harmonicscoming from other levels of the distribution system. This fact impliesthat computer analysis of harmonic propagation is of great importanceto evaluate the effects of the limits proposed in standards and to developsuitable criteria for the connection of disturbing loads. This paperdescribes the results of some studies of harmonic propagation on distributionnetworks. The results were obtained by applying the &quot;transfer matrix&quot;method.</TEXT></DOC>
