Coal production jumped from66 million tons in 1952 to 947 million tons last year, rolled steelfrom 1 million tons to 47 million tons in the same period. Grainharvests grew from 113 million tons in 1949 to about 400 milliontons this year. China produced 14,000 bicycles in 1949, 41.2million in 1988; 1,600 refrigerators in 1957, 7.4 million last year.   Foreign trade is now $100 billion a year, 100 times more thanfour decades ago. Foreign investors have poured $12 billion into16,000 joint ventures and other projects.   In 1978, the year Deng started his reforms, 10,000 Chinese hadwashing machines. Now 43 million do. In 1983 only four out of every100 rural households had televisions. Now almost a third do. Ruralincomes, at 545 yuan ($147) per person a year, are triple those of1978. Urban residents earn 1,119 yuan ($302) a person, up 87.6percent over 1978 after deducting price rises.   Daunting problems remain. Illiteracy has been cut from 80percent of the population to 20 percent, but that still leaves 220million people who can't read and an underfinanced educationalsystem that does little to encourage children to stay in school.   The government says 60 million people, more than the entirepopulation of France, live below the poverty line of 200 yuan ($54)in annual income. Some in remote, barren areas depend on governmenthandouts for survival.   Forty years after Mao announced the end to exploitation of thepeople, more and more people are asking whether the progressachieved has been worth the pain.   A million people in the Beijing streets this past springdemanding democratic reform attested to disillusionment with theCommunist Party, which, like other absolute rulers, is tainted bycorruption, privilege and disdain for the common man.   After four decades China still lacks a legal system thatprotects people from the whims of politicians and police, and thelarge majority have little or no control over where they will liveor work.   The Communist Party's claims to infallibility have long beendiscredited by its excesses and miscalculations. There was the``anti-rightist'' campaign of 1957 that led to the persecution oftens of thousands of intellectuals; the economic fiasco of Mao'sLeap Forward in 1958, which was followed by crop failures and massstarvation; and the tragic folly of the leftist CulturalRevolution, which nearly destroyed a whole generation of educatedChinese.   Optimistic Chinese point out that in the past decade under DengXiaoping the periodic political campaigns against ``spiritualpollution'' and ``bourgeois liberalization'' have been far milder,with fewer arrests and less persecution than in the past. But sincethe June military attack on protesters in Beijing, followed by anationwide crackdown on dissent, the mellowing of the masters seemsless certain.   The party in turn is demanding patience, saying it will put itsdivided house in order and guide the nation to prosperous stabilityif only people learn to forgo Western political ideas and consumerhabits.   Jiang Zemin, the new Communist Party chief, set the stage forNational Day 1989 by returning to Yenan, the still-impoverishedtown of cave dwellers in northwest China where Mao set up hisrevolutionary base in the 1930s and 1940s.   ``We should carry forward the Yenan spirit of self reliance andhard struggle,'' Jiang said. ``It will be hard to accomplish thesocialist modernization drive without such a spirit.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 1</NOTE></DOC>
