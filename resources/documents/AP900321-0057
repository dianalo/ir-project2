The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that themeeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.   ``The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification,''said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.   ``I think that the place where they decided on the `finalsolution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and theanniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.''   Some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee,Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and partyofficials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews.   ``Jews have a right to state a moral position on Germanreunification and we will make a moral statement. And part of thatmoral statement is to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happenagain,'' Bronfman said.   In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be ``a verypositive thing'' for Europe, but certain precautions must be takento prevent a repeat of history. For example, Germany's borders``must be sealed in cement,'' and the country should not be allowednuclear weapons, he said.   Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitismonce the two Germanys are united. In fact, he said, reunificationmight cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings.   ``Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't beblaming the Jews'' for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.   The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration onGerman reunification will be issued May 8. It will be the firstmeeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress,which was founded in 1936 in response to Hitler's threats againstJews.</TEXT></DOC>
