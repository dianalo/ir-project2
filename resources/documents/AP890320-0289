ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Traders went back to work in the stock and bondmarkets today worried about the economic outlook and wondering, ``Ishistory going to repeat itself?''   A repeat of history would mean a precipitous drop in prices _another crash like Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.   The financial markets have been nervous for months aboutinflation and the prospect that the Federal Reserve Board wouldcontinue to drive interest rates higher to curb prices and cool offthe economy.   But concerns about how the economy could affect stock and bondprices became full-fledged anxiety on Friday, after the LaborDepartment reported inflation at the wholesale level soared 1percent for the second month in a row in February.   The news unleashed a storm of selling in the stock and creditmarkets. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell morethan 48 points, and the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fellmore than $17 for each $1,000 in face amount. That meant higherinterest rates.   Bond traders were so upset by the inflation report they totallydisregarded the strength of the dollar Friday. In many sessions inthe past, the credit markets shrugged off negative economic signalsbecause the dollar moved higher.   Traders didn't care about the dollar _ all they saw was interestrate hikes in the offing.   Friday's market trends continued today as stocks slumped andinterest rates and the dollar rose.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 12.50points at 2,279.64 as of 11 a.m. EST. The Treasury's long bond wasoff another $1.50 per $1,000 face value, as its yield, which movesin the opposite direction, rose to an even 9.3 percent. The dollarwas slightly up against the Japanese yen, West German mark andBritish pound.   To some observers, Friday's performance bore a disquietingresemblance to Oct. 16, 1987, also a Friday. That day, the Dow Jonesindustrial average lost 108 points in a precursor to its 508-pointcollapse three days later on Black Monday.   Could it happen again?   ``A crash-type situation is conceivable,'' said Robert Brusca,chief economist with Nikko Securities International, noting that``Overseas, things don't look any better.''   ``Japan has a currency that's falling and an economy that'sruning at a high rate of speed,'' he said.   The Japanese face high inflation because they are heavilydependent on oil imports, and the price of oil keeps climbing,Brusca said.   European nations face similar problems, he said.   But Raymond Stone, manager of global and fixed income andeconomic research for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, discounted thepossibility of a repeat of October 1987.   ``There is one difference,'' Stone said. ``Before the crash, thedollar was heading south ... The dollar has been firming the lastseveral days.''   ``You don't have the same lack of confidence you had at thattime,'' said Stone. ``You had a bad (inflation) number, but there'sno fear of a collaspe of the currency.''   ``I wouldn't go too far in making a comparison,'' he said.   Economic fundamentals aside, there is little chance of such asteep decline in stock prices as on Oct. 19, 1987 because safeguardshave been implemented as a result of the crash. On Friday, some ofthose safeguards were deployed.   Price limits on stock-index futures trading on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange _ known as circuit-breakers _ were used for thefirst time since being imposed last year by major financial markets.   Many critics blamed the effect of computerized strategiesinvolving simultaneous trading of stocks and the stock-index futuresfor worsening the crash, leading to the development of thecircuit-breakers, which also provide for a temporary halt in stockmarket trading if the Dow Jones average falls 250 points in one day.   Even with safeguards in place, Stone doubted there would be muchmovement in the markets Monday because of the impending release ofanother inflation indicator, the Consumer Price Index for February,on Tuesday.   ``I think there's going to be a lot of reluctance to make a majorcommitment until CPI,'' he said.   The consensus among economists was for a 0.5 percent increase inconsumer prices.   ``If the consensus' expectation is realized, it could take someof the steam out of the ugly number we got'' on Friday, Stone said.   William V. Sullivan, director of money market research for DeanWitter Reynolds Inc., said it would take more than just a few goodeconomic reports to turn the markets around.   ``There is almost a sense of despair in the marketplace regardingthe outlook for interest rates,'' he said.   Sullivan said he expected the Fed would tighten credit further.``It's highly improbable for any chance of a drop in interest ratesin the next few months.''   The Fed increased its discount rate _ the interest it charges itsmember banks _ half a percentage point to 7 percent almost fourweeks ago.   But Brusca, of Nikko Securities, said, ``The Fed is faced with areally terrible dilemma _ if the Fed were to tighten any quicker,what would it do to the dollar, which is already stronger than itshould be?''   When U.S. interest rates go up, the dollar becomes moreattractive to foreign investors and also rises. But when the dollaris too high, the U.S. trade deficit increases _ so a surge ininterest rates could widen the trade gap.   The trade deficit was cited as one of the factors contributing tothe 1987 crash.</TEXT></DOC>
