At present the emphasis in performing and reviewing fatigueanalyses is on the licensing steps before the NPP is put into operation.The designer must evaluate the fatigue loading pattern at an early stagein order to optimize the design. With respect to the lifetime assessmentof the plant, it is the opinion of the authors that only a simplifiedprocedure should be required for the operating license. To assess theresidual fatigue life at any time during operation, it makes much moresense to follow the plant operational history as it develops. To followthis approach, it is necessary to manage and process the plant operatingdata in such a way that it can be used for a detailed fatigue evaluation.Computerized systems which can meet these requirements are commerciallyavailable and used for viable parts in conventional power plants. Theadvantages of this procedure are (i) a more representative number toaccount for the actual fatigue load and life fraction used; (ii) a betterselection of local areas for recurring in-service inspection; (iii) amore reliable data base for the application of sophisticated fatigueanalyses to assess damage mechanisms including environmental and load-historyeffects. As a result, an increase in plant performance and safety isexpected.</TEXT></DOC>
