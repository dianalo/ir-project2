He has no campaign scheduler, no press secretary. He plans no fund-raisers. &quot;My daughter's the campaign manager, I'm the issues director, my son provides the security,&quot; he says. &quot;That's it.&quot;    The appeal -- and the very severe limits -- of Gary Hart's guerrilla campaign to return from political ignominy and capture the Democratic presidential nomination are on full display here. The lunch crowd at Minerva's Restaurant on South Phillips Street and the students at Southeast Votech Institute cheer him like a returning hero, but there isn't any evidence of any campaign organization to mobilize their support for the South Dakota primary only two months away.    Mr. Hart embarks on this unlikely quest with enormous handicaps: the contempt of his rivals and of party leaders; the ridicule of cabaret performers, late-night television comedians and wiseacres from coast to coast; a full set of unanswered questions about his private life and his relationships with various women, and the lack of even a minimalist's campaign organization.    His fiery-eyed response to conventional political wisdom: &quot;That's just too bad.&quot;    For the forseeable future, the Hart campaign will live off the land, fueled by what the candidate -- once an insurgent, then the front-runner and now an insurgent again -- calls &quot;an act of faith,&quot; taking sustenance from the doubts of the political elite.    And Mr. Hart brings to this effort the strong sense of personal destiny that repels so many critics and enraptures his supporters. &quot;I have some natural instincts,&quot; he says in an interview. &quot;It's not 'political' like the instincts of people in Washington who earn $100,000 or $200,000 to manage campaigns. It's rooted in a sense of the people. I know them, I sense what they want. This is not a foolish venture.&quot;    The Gary Hart who this week disrupted the entire Democratic presidential race seems little changed from the man who defied the odds and prevailed in the 1984 New Hampshire primary, or who sat in a tiny log-and-stone house along a cold stream two Decembers ago and said: &quot;Ever since I've been in politics, people have given me reasons why I couldn't do this or that. The world is full of people who will tell you why you can't do something.&quot;    The political world was full of reasons why Mr. Hart couldn't, or shouldn't, do what he did Tuesday when he filed as a candidate in the New Hampshire primary. &quot;I can understand why he didn't tell a lot of his friends beforehand,&quot; says Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political consultant. &quot;They would have had him committed.&quot;    That pales to the sense of betrayal that still flows through Democratic circles. Party leaders believe the Coloradan's inclination toward lonely crusades is at best self-indulgent and at worst a serious threat to the party's prospects of regaining the White House.    These voices haven't stilled Mr. Hart, who once again luxuriates in his defiance of conventional wisdom and of the experts. &quot;I think I know something they don't,&quot; he says.    In a year of &quot;un-campaigns&quot; -- Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, for example, enjoyed a brief burst of popularity precisely because he seemed so unlike a politician -- this is the ultra un-campaign. Mr. Hart seeks to portray his campaign as a mom-and-pop operation: He and his wife, Lee, tooling around America in a rental car, stopping at town squares and on Main Street, talking to people about the weather, this year's crop yield and a &quot;new foreign-policy framework for the 21st century.&quot; There'll be no television ads, no advisers with poll numbers on their tongues and computer printouts in their hands.    &quot;It will be the kind of campaign a lot of people said they wished we could go back to -- genuinely grass-roots, genuinely directed to the people,&quot; Mr. Hart says.    He won't discuss his private life or the relationship with Miami model Donna Rice, which left his original campaign in tatters. &quot;It's none of your business,&quot; he says.    The former senator says his re-entry has redeemed him in the eyes of his two grown children, adding that the family is prepared for damaging news reports about his private life.&quot;I'm ready for the meanness,&quot; he says. &quot;The real question is whether the American people are ready for it. There is a basic fairness in the American people, and they'll take only so much gratuitous meanness. You can only be mean to someone who deserves it. Besides, we can't be hurt much more.&quot;    A Boston Globe New Hampshire poll showed Mr. Hart with the support of 21% of Democratic voters there, behind only the 30% for Gov. Michael Dukakis of nearby Massachusetts. David Moore, a University of New Hampshire political scientist and pollster, predicts that Mr. Hart's poll ratings will decline after the Iowa caucuses, an organizational test where Mr. Hart isn't expected to show great strength.    The candidate says he doesn't expect to transform his campaign into an attack on the news media, but he plainly retains wounds from his treatment in the media and is resentful of the criticism that greeted his return to presidential politics. &quot;What concerns me a whole lot is the sense that editorial writers can dictate who runs for president,&quot; he says. &quot;People -- defenders of the First Amendment -- are coming very close to saying that I, an American, am not protected by that amendment.&quot;    Mr. Hart's initial test is to create enough spontaneous interest in his campaign to prompt the creation of an army of volunteers to gather enough signatures to place him on ballots across the country. &quot;It's my toughest, biggest challenge,&quot; he says, and many political experts say it isn't possible.    He was clearly stung by the implication that his re-entry into the race reflected his low regard for the six other Democratic candidates, a notion that prompted former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona to say, &quot;If he thinks the American people or the other candidates are waiting to be educated by him, he's kidding himself.&quot; Mr. Hart says now that his ideas on overhauling the military, foreign policy and investment in infrastructure and research centers are only different from those of his rivals, not better.    He's trying to make a virtue of his predicament as a low-budget candidate. He gleefully asks a reporter for 75 cents in exchange for a copy of his 96-page anthology of speeches, &quot;Reform, Hope and the Human Factor: Ideas for National Restructuring.&quot; And when he flips the pages on his yellow legal pad, he lingers on one sheet that, in a solitary moment, he had filled with the poetry of Tennyson: &quot;My purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset, and the baths of all the western stars, until I die.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
