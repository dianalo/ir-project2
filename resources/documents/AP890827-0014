The fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, said a a statementthat its main base in the village of Ein Abu-Suar ``sustainedextensive damage'' in the attack at sundown.   In Jerusalem, military officials reported destroying theHezbollah stronghold and said all Israeli planes returned safely.   The Hezbollah statement said ``there were material and humanlosses in the raid'' without giving specific casualty figures. Butpolice in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, said the body of at leastone Hezbollah guerrilla and five wounded men were taken to the portcity's al-Rai Hospital.   Ein Abu-Suar is 40 miles southeast of Beirut near the northernedge of Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.   The attack was Israel's ninth air raid in Lebanon this year. Thelast air strike was on June 21 when Israeli jets pounded a base ofAhmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand, a radical Syrian-backed Palestinian group, in the villageof Naameh south of Beirut.   Sunday's air raid is believed to come in retaliation for the Aug.9 suicide car bomb attack carried out by the Iranian-supportedHezbollah. That attack occurred in a south Lebanon strip of landalong the Israeli border that Israel has declared its security zone.   Five Israeli soldiers and an allied Lebanese militiaman wereinjured in the car bombing, and Israeli officials have vowed toavenge the attack.   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has said it carried out thebombing to avenge Israel's kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric,Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid. Israeli commandos seized Obeid in asouthern Lebanese village on July 28.   Israel said it abducted Obeid in order to win the release ofthree Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon since 1986. They arebelieved held by Hezbollah.   It has offered to swap Obeid and other captive Shiites for thethree Israeli captives and all 16 foreign hostages, including eightAmericans, who are believed to be held by Hezbollah or itsaffiliated groups. Hezbollah has rejected the offer.   A pro-Iranian Shiite faction called the Organization of theOppressed on Earth claimed on July 31 that it killed an Americanhostage, Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, in retaliation for theObeid abduction.</TEXT></DOC>
