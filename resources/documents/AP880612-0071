Celebrities, tennis pros and administration officials gatheredfor the annual White House tennis tournament to raise funds forNancy Reagan's anti-drug abuse fund.   President Reagan and the first lady joined a crowd of corporatesponsors and guests on the court, watching tennis stars TracyAustin, Vince Van Patten Jimmy Arias and Dennis Ralston compete ina match that had no winners _ local sportscaster and umpire GlennBrenner got the numbers mixed up.   The first couple also watched as Secretary of State Shultz andGOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf went down in defeat at the hands ofTreasury Secretary James Baker III and Wilhelm Wachtmeister, theambassador of Sweden.   It was the fourth such tennis tournament, and it raised some$500,000 for the Nancy Reagan Drug Abuse Fund.   At the end of the tournament, Mrs. Reagan presented $50,000checks to two anti-drug abuse groups, the Target InteractiveProject of Kansas City, Mo., and Wally's Club and Frontline FosterGrandparents Program of Nashville, Tenn.   ``Because of their work, the lives of many parents and childrenwill be much brighter, and America will be an even better place tolive,'' Mrs. Reagan said.</TEXT></DOC>
