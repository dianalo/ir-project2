(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Nets for the work on networksandM;You're walking a tightrope if you're not backing up your network.andP;  Safetynets -- in the form of LAN backup systems -- could save you from a painfulcrash landing.andM;By Emily KayandM;When her hard disk crashed, an Avatar Corp. administrator spent three daysrewriting a 25-page proposal.andP;  &quot;She hadn't backed up at all, and then herhard drive went,&quot; said Bill Suarez, manager of support and operations forAvatar of Hopkinton, Mass.andP;  &quot;She wasn't happy with me, but she hadn't donewhat she was supposed to have done.&quot;andM;Suarez's colleague's experience is like that of many Macintosh users.andP;  Thelast thing they want to think about is backing up their data.andP;  Unfortunately,it's more a question of when -- not if -- a hard disk crash or human errorwill wipe out weeks of work.andP;  And the loss of one user's data pales incomparison to the catastrophe of losing critical data residing on a company'sfile servers.andM;Familiar ground.andP;  With the Macintosh becoming a central component of LANs,many companies are now offering backup products in a variety of formats andcapacities for Macintosh-based networks.andP;  On the low end of the Macintosh LANbackup market, a variety of DC2000 and DC600 quarter-inch tape drives can beused to back up a central server.andP;  Companies that started in the IBM PCmarket are moving whole product lines over to the Macintosh.andM;&quot;As Macs move into larger corporations, [users] want to look for vendors theyknow are going to be there,&quot; said Marty Burke, Macintosh product manager withthe Irwin Products Group of Cipher Data Products Inc.andM;Irwin's experience and reputation were major reasons one West Coastconsultant chose the company's drive.andP;  &quot;We were impressed by [Irwin's] sales.andO;They couldn't have done that well if they didn't have a good product,&quot; saidthe consultant, who asked not to be identified.andP;  The consultant backs upabout 90 Mbytes of data per month, which has overtaken the 80-Mbyte limit ofhis Irwin unit.andP;  He plans to increase its capacity with extended-lengthcartridges.andM;More is better.andP;  FWB Inc. targets its backup systems at the high end of themarket, said Norman Fong, who is vice president of engineering for the SanFrancisco company.andP;  The company offers a range of high-capacity drives.andP;  TheHammerTape 250, a $1,895 tape system using DC600 cartridges, will back up 250Mbytes of data at up to 7 Mbytes per minute, according to Fong.andP;  At the verytop of its line, FWB offers the 8mm HammerTape FMS, which has a 5-Gbytecapacity and is priced at $9,995.andM;Advanced Digital Information Corp.'s MacBack series is a recent entrant intothe Macintosh market.andP;  The products range from the MacBack 60, a 60-Mbytedrive priced at $1,895, to the $6,495 MacBack 8000, which has a 10-cartridgeautochanger and can store up to 1.2 Gbytes of data, said Bob Reed, AdvancedDigital Information's marketing manager.andM;Soft-headedness prevails.andP;  While the capacity of backup hardware isimportant, software can make or break a company's backup strategy.andP;  Animportant function, say network administrators, is the capability to scheduleunattended, file-by-file backups.andM;Without the backup software developed by 3M Corp. of St. Paul, Minn., ADIC'sMacBack would likely not be in the Macintosh market, said Reed.andP;  The softwarelets users or network administrators run unattended backups of workstationsand servers over AppleTalk and can back up AppleShare servers completely,including access-privilege data, he said.andM;Only a handful of vendors let network managers back up users' data to asingle location.andP;  MacBack's ability to perform client or server backups wascritical for Don Moore, network administrator with Aldus Corp. of Seattle.andO;&quot;We want to be able to program backups from the workstation or the backupserver,&quot; said Moore, who beta tested MacBack.andP;  &quot;We can do both with MacBack.&quot;andM;With Personal Computer Peripherals Corp.'s NetStream software, networkmanagers can schedule incremental, unattended backups, while users determinewhich files they wish to have the server back up, said Bob Leeds, vicepresident of PCPC.andP;  NetStream supports PCPC's JetStream 8mm tape unit, PCPC'sDATStream, and a variety of other tape and optical drives.andP;  The NetStreamadministrator package is priced at $499, plus $89 per node.andP;  The JetStreamdrive, including the NetStream administrator and one user node, costs $4,279.andO;DATStream with the same NetStream software costs $2,879.andM;Randy Yerzyk, manager of Macintosh systems with SBRA, an architectural firmin Boston, bought a JetStream to run file-by-file backups across his network.andO;Running on a Mac Plus server, it continually crashed his AppleShare networkwhen shutting down at the end of the day.andP;  Yerzyk is considering othervendors' products and PCPC has offered to refund his money.andM;Roy Standing liked NetStream's client-backup capabilities.andP;  As the researchand development arm of the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md.,andO;Standing's Office of Computer and Communications Services employs manyprofessionals who don't want anyone touching their Macs, even to back themup.andP;  PCPC's solution enabled Standing to back up each system &quot;withoutinterfering with the individual,&quot; he said.andM;Northern Telecom Inc.'s Memory Bank is a high-end tape and fixed-disk systemthat backs up clients directly from the server using its Manager 3.0software, said Prue Heikkinen, marketing manager for NTI's Memory SystemDivision.andM;The Memory Bank, however, won't work across multiple AppleTalk zones, whichlimits the number of server-to-client backups available to Jay Thomas, aresearch engineer with Du Pont's Imaging Systems department in Brevard, N.C.andO;Still, Thomas preferred NTI's integrated solution to PCPC's pay-as-you-goscheme.andM;&quot;We bought [a Memory Bank] before the client backup was in the software, and[NTI] sent the software to all its users as a free update,&quot; Thomas said.andO;Memory Bank prices range from $8,900 for a 485-Mbyte hard disk and a150-Mbyte tape drive to $17,900 for a 940-Mbyte hard drive and a 2.3-Gbyte8mm tape.andM;It's easy to see that putting Macintosh servers on your LAN without acoherent backup strategy is begging for trouble.andP;  But trouble can be avoidedor at least minimized with the capacity of today's hardware used with thesoftware that lets network managers run unattended, incremental serverbackups.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
