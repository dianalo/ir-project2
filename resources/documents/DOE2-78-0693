The Ashland real-time information system (Artis) was designedto improve timeliness and accuracy of yield accounting to the refinery,and to standardize software communications between applications. Withthe system, real-time data are collected in a central data server andused to feed normal data reconciliation software for validation. Thispart of the system has been successfully implemented. Standardizationof software communications is still under design, but most of the communicationpaths have been defined because a highly evolved information system alreadyexists at the refinery. And efforts are under way to integrate informationfrom the process to optimization.</TEXT></DOC>
