Last week, Phoenix-based Stateswest proposed to the board ofdirectors of Mesa, based in Farmington, N.M., that it acquire 100percent of Mesa's common stock for $7 a share cash and one share ofa new series of 6 percent convertible preferred stock of Stateswest.   The chairman of Stateswest, Rudy R. Miller, said in a statementthat last week's offer was essentially a repeat of an earlieroffer, so Mesa had plenty of time to review the proposal. Millersaid that Mesa's refusal to act amounted to a rejection.   Both airlines are regional carriers that serve the Southwest.</TEXT></DOC>
