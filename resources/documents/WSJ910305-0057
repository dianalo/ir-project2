With Iraq's defeat, Japanese politicians, officials andbusiness leaders are debating what their country can do tohelp with the tasks of postwar reconstruction. After monthsof toeing Washington's line in the Gulf conflict, manyJapanese have a strong feeling that their country must find away to show more independence and initiative in foreignpolicy.</LP><TEXT>   But forging a coherent war-reconstruction policy, aForeign Ministry official notes, won't be an easy task.Almost every proposal under consideration has drawbacks.   Japan's relations with the U.S. will continue to be trickyto manage. U.S.-Japan ties seem better today than they werejust a few weeks ago, when Congressmen were openly blastingTokyo's contributions to the Gulf effort as too little, toolate. Japan's promise to chip in an additional $9 billion insupport for the U.S.-led multinational forces mollifed manyAmericans.   However, smoldering American resentment over Japan'sinitial hesitance to contribute to the Gulf effort couldflare again if, for example, Japan diverts some of thepromised $9 billion to postwar reconstruction efforts.   The desire of some Japanese for a slightly lesssuffocating relationship with the U.S. could increasetension. Meanwhile, the two countries are facing yet anotherround of contentious trade talks.   Sensitivity to the fragility of U.S.-Japan ties is alreadytempering desire in Japan for a more independent role.Japanese politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders worrythat other countries will criticize Japan if it moves tooaggressively on its own. Japanese are consulting withAmericans in hopes of coordinating approaches.   &quot;We're willing to be a big player -- if asked, that is,&quot;says Kiichi Miyazawa, a former finance minister who currentlyruns one of the major Diet factions of the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party.   &quot;We are ready. We would like to do everything we can do,&quot;says Tetsuo Kondo, an LDP Diet member. &quot;But there are many,many things to be considered.&quot;   Among the considerations:   -- Could Japan help fund and administer a new MarshallPlan for the Middle East? Mr. Miyazawa has proposed preciselythat. In one version of his proposal, he calls for acontribution of $1 billion a year for 10 years. He says Japancould spend &quot;billions of dollars&quot; a year on the plan, andurges that the money be used to help not only countriesdirectly involved but also those that have sufferedeconomically from the crisis, from Jordan and Egypt in theMiddle East to Pakistan and the Philippines in Asia.   But how far the fiscally cautious Finance Ministry wouldbe willing to go in ponying up cash for such a plan isunclear, and even Foreign Ministry officials aren't promisingmassive sums at this point.   -- How active should Japanese business be in the postwarGulf market? Japan's manufacturers, construction companiesand plant exporters have long experience in the Middle East.Japan's general trading companies -- with their massiveinformation-gathering networks and their proven ability tomediate between manufacturers and potential customersworldwide -- would be uniquely situated to help with thereconstruction of the Gulf.   &quot;I really don't think many advanced democracies have anyequivalent to the {general trading companies} for theseoccasions,&quot; Mr. Miyazawa says. But he worries that Japan willbe criticized for making money in the Gulf when it wasn'twilling to shed blood there by contributing troops to thealliance. &quot;We don't want to appear too enthusiastic for doingbusiness,&quot; he says.   -- Can Japan reshape its economic aid policies to helpdiscourage the rise of future Saddam Husseins? Japan doesn'texport arms generally, and is specifically proud that itdidn't help build up Iraq's military. Now there are proposalsthat Japan decline to give economic aid to needy countriesthat export arms. Other proposals suggest that Japan limitits aid to countries that don't have or aren't developingnuclear weapons.   The problem is that such proposals might stop Japan fromhelping countries that it is most interested in helping, suchas China and Pakistan. &quot;We are in an impossible position,&quot;says Mr. Miyazawa.   -- Does Japan have a diplomatic role to play in thepostwar Middle East? Nobuo Matsunaga, a former ambassador toWashington, says that Japan has had friendly relations withcountries in the Middle East, such as Iran, that the U.S. hasbeen at odds with. Japan thus has &quot;good offices&quot; that couldbe used in helping resolve some of the region's problems.   Though public opinion in Japan was divided, the Japanesegovernment supported the U.S.-led forces at every turn. Theprice for this was a growing Japanese feeling of frustrationwith their country's lack of independence in foreign policy.The phrase that pops up often in Japanese conversations is&quot;shiriuma ni noru&quot;, which literally suggests riding on thehindquarters of the horse and by extension means followingsomeone blindly. The mood isn't so much anti-American as itis a desire for Japan to have its own foreign policy.   As many Japanese see it, the longer-range problem raisedby the war is the relative importance of economic andmilitary power. Does Japan's possession of one but not theother limit its ability to take an independent line?   &quot;For the past 45 years, we had some inferiority complexbecause international decisions were made based on militarypower, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union were the greatmilitary powers,&quot; says Koichi Kato, a senior LDP Diet member.&quot;Because we aren't a military power, we felt we weren't anindependent, well-matured country. When the U.S. and Sovietsagreed to end the Cold War, we were very happy that the timeof economics {as the main source of world power} has come.But with Saddam Hussein, the military element has resurged.That is quite an unhappy phenomenon for world stability andfor Japan. Saddam Hussein has reversed the general tendencyof world politics for 10 years.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
