Stalin and Hitler run intoeach other in the lobby of the Stanford Court Hotel and sign a non-aggressionpact. But when Stalin goes for a walk, Hitler immediately takes over Stalin'sroom -- it has a better view. Stalin is stunned: He and Hitler were to havedinner together.;    Plots and counterplots, murders and purges ensue, so thatby the time the conference opens the following day, all of the panelists haveliquidated one another. The dais is empty except for the conference'smoderator, Robert Conquest, the eminent Sovietologist, important 20th-centurypoet and former curator of the Hoover Institution library.;    BUT AS LONG asRobert Conquest remained, it would not much matter that the dictators hadwiped themselves out before the conference opened. Typically, tyrants lackself-insight and have no ability to answer the question: How did a monstersuch as you attain power? They are even less able to answer: How can we keepmonsters like you from attaining power?;    A case in point is a story aboutAlfredo Stroessner, the dictator who ruled Paraguay from 1954 to 1989, thatappeared in Granta magazine last fall. The author spent months in Paraguaytrying to track Stroessner down. The less success she had, the more hercuriosity grew, until with no warning she got a phone call and within hoursfound herself in Brazil, interviewing Stroessner in exile. The man turned outto be hollow, vacant, a dud. The author returned to Scotland and called aBritish diplomat she had known for years to tell him how uninterestingStroessner was.;    &quot;I'm not surprised,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;Those peoplenever are.&quot;;    Conquest, on the other hand, is interesting. A widelyanthologized poet who writes both serious and light verse, he is also,according to the Los Angeles Times, &quot;the West's No. 1 expert on the Stalinpurges.&quot; Born and educated in England, Conquest wears the rumpled jackets andhas the messy office -- &quot;Now, where was that article on me that Pravdapublished? I saw it only a moment ago&quot; -- that one associates with middle-agedprofessors.;    But Conquest is no ordinary scholar lost in the arcane. Hisinterest in the Soviet Union began with a trip there in 1937. During World WarII, he took a crash course in Bulgarian and was dropped behind the lines forliaison with Bulgarians fighting the Nazis. Technically, he was under Russiancommand, and he &quot;was much taken with the reckless, devil-may-care attitude of(Soviet soldiers) of all ranks, and their rough attitude to stuffy politicalofficers and secret policemen. But it soon became obvious that that theCommunist-controlled police ministry was behaving atrociously, under directSoviet instructions, and I date my final revulsion from the Stalinist systemto early 1945.&quot;;    In books like The Great Terror and The Harvest of Sorrow,Conquest uncovered the hideous forced collectivization of agriculture and theincomprehensibly brutal purges that Stalin carried out in the late 1920s and'30s. Through meticulous research under the most adverse conditions -- theRussians weren't exactly giving grants to do this kind of work -- hediscovered that 15 million people had perished in Stalin's purges.;    &quot;MaximGorki says somewhere in his notebooks that if a flea was magnified 1,000times, it would be the most dangerous creature on earth,&quot; Conquest says in hiscorner office at the Hoover. &quot;That is Stalin. Sucking blood and being huge, aparasite on the human race.&quot; He pauses to think a moment, then adds, &quot;Goya'spicture of Saturn devouring his children also comes to mind. But in a way, itisn't right. Saturn looks a bit mad; Stalin looked benign and quiet. Saturnwas only eating his own children; Stalin ate everyone else's as well.&quot;;    Forhis groundbreaking work, Conquest was vilified not only by the Soviets --&quot;bourgeois falsification!&quot; -- but also by Western academics who had aprofessional stake in disbelieving that purges on a scale beyond the barbarichad occurred. Then glasnost came along and an extraordinary thing happened:Conquest the enemy of the Soviet state became Conquest the honored historian.The Soviets opened their archives, and the material supported and addedconfirmatory detail to Conquest's studies. His work had always been banned inRussia; now it was being published, and Izvestia was talking about Conquest's&quot;truthful books&quot; and Pravda was saying that Conquest &quot;has drawn the picture ofour 1920s and 1930s more honestly than we have ourselves.&quot; A.B. Chakovsky, anold Stalinist, was quoted in Izvestia asking, &quot;What did we struggle for? Lookat what is done in our literature. Who now leads in our literature? Conquest-- anti-Sovietchik No. 1.&quot;;    BECAUSE CONQUEST KNOWS Stalin's tyranny sowell, and is such an accomplished student of the pathological will to power,he's an appropriate person to ask about the dictator of the hour, SaddamHussein, who has said that he modeled the Iraqi state on Stalinist Russia.;   There are in fact similarities in the two dictators' personal lives.;   &quot;Saddam and his closest colleagues are known for their vulgarity,&quot; JudithMiller and Laurie Mylroie write in their book Saddam Hussein and the Crisis inthe Gulf. &quot;Mafia-like stories of their extreme clannishness and brutality arelegion inside Iraq.&quot;;    It was even worse in the Kremlin under Stalin.;   &quot;Stalin's life was gloomy, frightful. The Kremlin was a squalid little world,&quot;Conquest says. &quot;Stalin stayed up till 3 a.m. talking with his entourage. Itwas incredibly boring. There were no women there, but sometimes they wouldlisten to music, and men would dance with men. One night, a secret policeagent in Poland danced with Molotov (Stalin's foreign minister). Molotovwhispered in his ear, 'If you are connected to any imperialist agencies,you'll catch it!' How's that for a lovely evening? Dancing with Molotov andhaving threats whispered in your ear till 3 a.m.&quot;;    Saddam had an unhappychildhood, growing up in a dusty village in a mud hut. His father is said tohave abandoned his wife and children when Saddam was very young. The boy spenthis first 10 years being terrorized by a stupid, mean-spirited stepfather.According to Miller and Mylroie, Saddam has told people that his &quot;stepfatherwould drag him out of bed at dawn, barking, 'Get up, you son of a whore, andlook after the sheep,' &quot; and would tell Saddam's mother, &quot;He is the son of adog. I don't want him.' &quot;;    Stalin was also born into a peasant family andis reported to have been beaten as a child. Did the abuse these men receivedas children turn them into monsters?;    &quot;It's clear that psychologicalanalyses are rather difficult if you don't know the facts,&quot; Conquest says.&quot;With Stalin, there are two different stories: One is that he loved his motherand hated his father. The other is the other way around. The traditional storyis that he was beaten by his father, and his mother looked after him. But inany peasant family around the world the father beats up the kids occasionally,and they don't hold it against him.&quot;;    Conquest notes that psychologicalprofiles have been done on the central figures of the French Revolution: &quot;Theyall turned out to have been brought up nicely and had very happy childhoods,&quot;he says, flashing the grin that appears when he speaks about somethingparticularly complex or perverse in the human psyche. What else can one do butgrin?;    Conquest finds a similar perversity in the diaries of HeinrichHimmler, the head of Hitler's SS. &quot;Out of Himmler's diaries comes a feeling ofabsolute nonentity; it's most extraordinary: 'Took Gertrude to tea. She is anice girl.' There is a feeling that he is put upon, that he isn't treated aswell as he should be by the world. But that's a very common feeling amongyoung men, and they don't all grow up to be Himmlers. You have to havesomething in you which keeps you going.&quot;;    What is that something? Is it thewill to power?;    &quot;With both Stalin and Saddam, the will to power is veryhigh,&quot; Conquest says, but he points out that the drive is present in allpoliticians, the majority of whom are decent human beings. &quot;I often think ofone of those Dali paintings when I think of Stalin,&quot; Conquest continues. &quot;Thehead is normal except for these huge lobes that are sticking out the sides.With Stalin, those lobes were the will to power. It's clear that from hisearly school days, he regarded the world as a pit of hostility and had to leadany group he was with.;    &quot;By itself the will to power doesn't get you veryfar,&quot; Conquest adds. &quot;You've got to have the skills of this particular game.Al Capone wasn't a brilliant intellect, but he did know how to balance hisconstituencies.&quot;;    TO CONQUEST, POLITICS IS largely a matter of personaltemperament -- in other words, your political views are formed more by thekind of person you are than by rational processes. To become a dictator, oneneed not have had a miserable childhood. But the kind of dictator you becomewill be determined more by your personality than by your political views.;   &quot;There are some temperaments who can rule and not be tempted to any lunacies,even if they are despotic, and there are others who can't,&quot; Conquest says.&quot;The restraints are both internal and external and have to be strong because(dictators) are on a very steep slope.&quot;;    Saddam and Stalin share thetemperament of cold-blooded killers.;    &quot;Stalin, and it appears to be true ofSaddam, actually liked killing people,&quot; Conquest says. &quot;He thought if youkilled someone, you'd really done something. In 1919, during the civil war, agroup of officers fell under suspicion, and he ordered them shot. Somebodysaid this could cause a problem because there wasn't any evidence againstthem. Stalin said, 'No it won't. No men, no problem.' And he was quite right.It didn't.&quot;;    The day after Hitler slaughtered his SA leaders on the Nightof the Long Knives in 1934, Conquest says, Stalin opened a meeting of thePolitburo with: &quot; 'Have you seen the news from Germany? Hitler, what a lad!Knows how to deal with opponents.' That's a precise translation, by the way.&quot;;   At a party to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the secret police, anexecutioner imitated a man being dragged to his death, shouting, &quot; 'Oh no,this is a mistake! Call comrade Stalin!' Stalin roared with laughter. Hethought it was the funniest thing he had ever heard,&quot; Conquest says. Stalinkept killing the captains of his bodyguards, lest they plot against him, andimprisoning and killing the relatives of his secretaries. When one of themappealed to him, Stalin replied, &quot;I've imprisoned and shot plenty of myrelatives. What's so special about yours?&quot;;    As for Saddam, a videotape ofan Iraqi cabinet meeting held shortly after Saddam became president in 1979has floated around the Middle East for years. Saddam sits behind a desk at thefront of the room, puffing on a cigar. The ministers are squirming. Saddamreads a name. Two members of the Republican Guard grab a man, take him fromthe room and summarily execute him. Saddam puffs on his cigar and readsanother name.;    &quot;Dostoevski says that once a man gets caught up in violence,it is difficult to get out,&quot; Conquest says. &quot;Dictators start killing people.Then they suspect that others would mind, so they kill them. Things getcompletely out of hand and ruin the whole state for a bit. Something like thatappears to have happened in Iraq. Iraqi politics has been extremely violentfor the last 30 years. There are tyrannies all over the world, but this hashad a special nastiness about it. They'd shoot their previous cabinets andshow it all on television. Once the cycle starts, more and more brutal peoplecome to power.&quot;;    AT SOME POINT, HOWEVER, THE USE of murder as a politicaltool reaches its limits: The dictator murders so many people, there is no oneleft to run the country. In a review of one of Conquest's books, Robert V.Daniels, an authority on Russian history, observes, &quot;My own study of the agecomposition of the postwar Soviet elite shows that, apart from a minusculegroup of cronies, Stalin literally purged everybody who was somebody in theUSSR over the age of 35 (or for the military, over 40).&quot;;    The more murdersa dictator is responsible for, the more distrustful he becomes. His view ofreality becomes twisted; he sees plots against him everywhere. If his closeassociates don't adopt this paranoid view of reality, they quickly fall undersuspicion. The result is decisions that have the most appalling consequences.;   &quot;Stalin didn't believe the Germans were going to attack in World War II. Hethought he and Hitler were going to have a summit meeting,&quot; Conquest says.&quot;Before the attack came, Beria, the head of the secret police, wrote to Stalinsaying, 'Three or four of your agents in Berlin' -- and he named them -- 'arereporting that the Germans are going to attack. I've had them arrested andsent to labor camps where they will be ground to dust. We know your greatplans. We know the Germans will not attack.' Here are these unfortunate Sovietagents heroically passing information, and as soon as they arrive in Russia,bang! They're dead. And then the Germans attack!;    &quot;After the invasion,Stalin went to pieces for at least two days,&quot; Conquest says. &quot;He sat collapsedin his villa; somebody said, 'He looked like they were going to arrest him.'In any government, they would have, but he'd gotten rid of all thealternatives. And as soon as he got back on his feet, he shot all the peoplein jail, all the survivors of the big trials, to make sure there were noalternatives.&quot;;    Saddam, like Stalin, eliminated anyone who might be athreat to him. Those who remained competed to second the dictator's everydecision.;    &quot;With Stalin and Saddam, all politics are within a small group,&quot;Conquest says. &quot;There is a narrowness to politics, partly because the No. 2and 3 men, and so on down the line, don't advance the discussion. If thedictator says, 'Are there any objections to this plan?' a subordinate willthink several times before he dares make an objection, and if he does, he'llmake it very mild. 'Well, there is one thing that could go wrong,' he'll say.'What might that be?' the tyrant will ask. 'Oh, I don't think it will withyour able leadership,' the subordinate will answer.&quot;;    Stalin's killing wasmassive and without reason. Saddam refused to get out of Kuwait even whenconfronted by a massive force with vastly more sophisticated weaponry. Canthese men be classified as clinically paranoid?;    &quot;That is what they arearguing about in Soviet psychological journals now,&quot; Conquest says aboutStalin. &quot;I would say yes, he was paranoid, as long as we use the word in thelayman's sense. He suspected hostility everywhere and felt hostile toeverything. He wanted power because if he didn't have it, somebody would bedoing something against him.&quot;;    Stalin's paranoia increased as he aged. In1952, the year before his death, Stalin's doctor told him he needed to take along rest from politics. Stalin had the doctor shot. &quot;He naturally thoughtthis was a plot, because that was what he and his pals did with Lenin whenLenin was ill.&quot;;    Saddam, says Conquest, is &quot;not totally without a sense ofreality: He didn't attack Syria and Turkey at the same time. It's not thatSaddam doesn't recognize some limitations. They just were not enough to keephim out of trouble.;    &quot;On the other hand, Saddam's gamble (of going intoKuwait) wasn't a bad one,&quot; Conquest continues. &quot;The world reaction has beenstronger and the American and Western and Arab League power has been betterdeployed than one might have thought possible. Saddam misread the signals andwas unable to negotiate his way out. He's not a very credible peacemaker.&quot;;   STALIN IS A MORE MODERN DICTATOR than Saddam, and therefore a more terribleone, because he was utopian. &quot;Saddam is more old-fashioned, more a Tamerlanetype of thing,&quot; Conquest says. &quot;There's no modernity about his regime exceptthe technology. He doesn't seem to have a particular aim aside from theold-fashioned tribal or religious or racial aims.&quot;;    Stalin, on the otherhand, attempted to create a &quot;New Soviet Man&quot; and bring about the firstworldwide revolution. &quot;The will to perfection is absolutely the cause of somuch evil,&quot; Conquest says. &quot;If you start going for a utopia, you end up with,'This guy is getting in the way. Let's shoot him.' As everybody gets in theway of a utopia sooner or later, you can only do it by mass terror.&quot;;    Thedrive to utopia requires that the state &quot;get a grip on every inch of asociety, the economy, education, everything that's printed, every idea,&quot;Conquest says. &quot;You end up getting purges among astronomers because sunspotsmay be connected with bad weather, and that's sabotaging the crops. And ofcourse the weather bureau was shot.&quot;;    Although Saddam may pay lip serviceto the Ba'ath Socialist party's combination of socialist ideas with pan-Arabnationalism, there is no evidence he has tried to create a socialist paradisein Iraq. The forced collectivization of agriculture and a centrally plannedeconomy have crippled the Soviet Union. But in Iraq, there was littleideological interference in the production of oil and agriculture. Saddam haslittle or no interest in ideology -- which may explain why intellectuals havenot adopted him, as so many did Stalin. Saddam's only interest is power.;   THE PROBLEM THE WORLD FACES IS keeping paranoid killers like Saddam and Stalinfrom taking power. Conquest thinks it can happen. It has already happened inmost Western countries. Those who try to usurp power in a democracy end up outof politics: Richard Nixon is a case in point. Spain, Greece, Portugal, whichwere ruled by strong men until quite recently, have made remarkabletransitions to democracy. That trend can continue, as is happening now inEastern Europe, if countries continue to adopt pluralist governments thatincorporate a wide spectrum of political viewpoints.;    &quot;I'm not suredemocracy is the issue, but political liberty, civic order and a tradition ofcooperation certainly is,&quot; Conquest says. &quot;England was free long before it wasdemocratic. Voting until the 1860s was very limited.;    &quot;We've got to settlefor a world order in which the big pluralistic states, joined perhapseventually by Russia, will have the main influence. We've got to have a systemas we did a century ago. Right or wrong, the intervention into small statesthat might develop atomic weapons must be countenanced.&quot;;    What happens inthe next few years in the Soviet Union may decide which direction the worldgoes in the next century. &quot;Things are hanging by a thread there now,&quot; saysConquest, but he points out that no matter how bad things are, the Sovietshave had five years of real politics. Five years is not the same as the 215years the United States has had, but it counts for something.;    &quot;UnderBrezhnev, the Soviets invested in trouble all over the world -- Ethiopia,Angola, Cuba. Their policy seemed to be, 'Make as much trouble as you caneverywhere against the West,' &quot; Conquest says. &quot;I don't think the Sovietswould have intervened in force in the Gulf after Afghanistan, but think howmuch worse things would be if they were supporting Iraq politically andproviding Saddam arms. It would have made a bad situation impossible.;    &quot;Ithink, in the long run, that things will go all right in the Soviet Union,&quot;Conquest concludes. &quot;Yeltsin and Gorbachev are the only two on the scene. Theright wing doesn't have anyone to put forward, and the moderates are strongerthan one thought. The attitude seems to be, 'Stand pat, don't let's collapseinto chaos.' Nobody seems to want the trouble all their actions seem to beheading toward. There's a slight feeling that stability, a balance of sorts,has been struck.&quot;;    On the other hand, he admits, &quot;Anything can happen inthe Soviet Union. The whole thing is hanging by a thread. It is one of thosetimes when you feel a small event might trigger anything.&quot; But he believesthere is hope because, paradoxically, the country is exhausted.;    &quot;One ofthe great things you see in Russia now is that they are sick of utopia,&quot;Conquest says. &quot;You get some lunatic notions about the perfect Russia, butamong the intellectual classes and the working classes, no one wants to hearabout socialism, communism and the revolution. All that stuff is gone; they'resick of the whole thing.;    &quot;They've wasted more than 70 years -- more thanwasted. They haven't solved the economic problem at all. But since November,the food is better than it has been. I've become more hopeful. Nobody seems towant the trouble all their actions seem to be heading toward.&quot;;    And thatmay be the best defense against tyrants.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  John Hubner  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910331  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  3,693  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 31, 199100091170,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
