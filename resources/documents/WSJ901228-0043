The order, from U.S. District Judge John McBryde in FortWorth, Texas, comes amid a protracted contract disputebetween the Allied Pilots Association and American, a unit ofAMR Corp., Dallas. The airline alleged the union has beenwaging a job action, which would be illegal under specialprovisions of labor law that apply to airline workers.</LP><TEXT>   The union has vigorously denied such allegations before. Aspokesman yesterday reiterated that position. &quot;It won't bedifficult for us to comply with the court order. We haven'tbeen doing anything illegal in the first place,&quot; he said.   American contends heightened levels of sick leave havebeen worsening operating problems at the carrier caused bypilots being called up for military duty in Saudi Arabia.This drain has reduced American's flexibility to respond topilot absences. As a result, the carrier will cut flightschedules by about 4% beginning in February, according toR.W. Baker, executive vice president of operations, in aninterview.   Planning under a &quot;worst-case assumption,&quot; Mr. Baker saidhe figures 450 of American Airlines' 9,000 pilots could belost evenutally to the military, up from 250 currently.   Meantime, the airline has assumed that &quot;sick time at thesehigh levels will continue,&quot; Mr. Baker said. The executivesaid that the number of pilots calling in sick climbedsteadily from early December, when about 323 were out, to 524yesterday. &quot;We would have expected something in the range of300&quot; based on historical patterns, he said.   Harsh weather in the days preceding the Christmas holidayat four of the six cities integral to American's route systemexacerbated the difficulties, he added.   All these factors led the airline to seek the restrainingorder Wednesday night, though Mr. Baker said American hadbeen preparing its court filing of more than 200 pages for atleast three months.   In his order, Judge McBryde said that he granted therequest because the airline &quot;is likely to prevail on themerits of its claims,&quot; and that the &quot;disruptive activity&quot;could &quot;cause American Airlines to suffer a substantial lossof revenue and passenger goodwill which it can neverrecover.&quot;   The judge scheduled a Jan. 3 hearing on American's requestfor a preliminary injunction. The temporary order laststhrough Jan. 5.   Although American's pilots have been working without acontract since Dec. 30, 1989, they are forbidden from workslowdowns, strikes and other actions under the Railway LaborAct. The law, which applies to airlines and their laborgroups, requires a prolonged series of actions before airlineunions can act outside negotiations.   First, if the two sides can't agree, they can petition fora federally appointed mediator, who in this dispute wascalled in last spring. In fact, there were talks as recentlyas last Friday, and another round is scheduled for Jan. 7,Mr. Baker said.   If the two sides still can't agree, they can be declaredat an impasse and enter a 30-day, cooling-off period. Only ifthat period ends without a new contract is the union free tostrike and the company to impose whatever work rules and payit chooses.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,AMR shares closed at $48.375, down 50 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
