Crystalinformed its editors he will no longer prepare the annualsurvey, citing interference from parent Time Warner Inc.   Mr. Crystal, whom Fortune describes in the survey as&quot;America's foremost authority on executive compensation,&quot;began the survey the year before the merger of Time Inc. andWarner Communications Inc., and has been highly critical ofthe compensation package awarded to Time Warner Chairman andCo-Chief Executive Officer Steven J. Ross since the merger.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Crystal, a former consultant on executive-compensationissues, is now adjunct professor at the Haas School ofBusiness at the University of California at Berkeley, andeditor of the Crystal Report newsletter on compensation. Mr.Crystal was paid a fixed fee of $12,000 in each of the firsttwo years and $14,000 in each of the past two years for thearticles and had no long-term contract.   In the most recent survey, in Fortune's June 17 issue, Mr.Ross topped the list of highest-paid executives with 1990compensation that Mr. Crystal valued at $39.1 million, almostdouble the next-highest-paid chief executive on the list. Mr.Crystal valued co-chief executive N.J. Nicholas'scompensation at $7.4 million.   Executive compensation surveys this spring for otherbusiness magazines valued Mr. Ross's total compensation muchhigher than Fortune did. A survey by Forbes magazine put Mr.Ross's total compensation last year at $78.1 million. Asurvey by Business Week put Mr. Ross's total compensation at$78.2 million. A Wall Street Journal survey done by TowersPerrin on executive compensation didn't include a calculationfor Time-Warner executives. Its proxy statement was issuedtoo late for the survey.   In calculating Mr. Ross's compensation for 1990, Mr.Crystal included $3.3 million in salary and othercompensation and a stock-option grant that gives Mr. Ross theright to purchase 1.8 million Time Warner shares at $150apiece over 12 years. While Mr. Crystal said it was possibleMr. Ross &quot;would make countless millions from the options --or nothing,&quot; he calculated the options' present value at$35.8 million.   Mr. Crystal said he has been gradually refining themethodology of the survey in agreement with Fortune editors,altering it in an effort to improve it each year. But for thelatest survey, he said, he originally calculated the value ofthe options Mr. Ross had been granted at more than $100million. After consulting with Fortune editors, Mr. Crystalsaid that to get the survey published, he agreed to break alllarge stock-option grants in the survey into thirds,resulting in the $35.8 million valuation for Mr. Ross'soptions.   &quot;If the grant is a real whopper,&quot; the survey article said,&quot;then adding it in all at once would again introducedistortion.&quot; It went on to explain that the other two-thirdswould be added in the following years' surveys. In a boxaccompanying the article, Mr. Crystal wrote that Time Warnerexecutives told him that Mr. Ross's compensation represented&quot;a replacement of the equity-based compensation awarded Rossby Warner before his company was acquired by Time Inc. in1989.&quot;   Mr. Crystal said Time Warner has disagreed with hisvaluation methods, which use a computer model to give presentvalue to stock-option grants. Mr. Crystal's survey includes200 companies from Fortune's lists of the largest industrialand service companies. Total direct compensation in thesurvey includes salary and bonus, the value of restrictedstock grants and performance shares or units, and estimatedvalue of stock-option grants.   The issue of editorial independence at the stable of Timemagazines was a matter of public concern before Time mergedwith Warner, and Mr. Ross, who had been Warner's chairman,took over as top executive. To be sure, most publicationswould proceed carefully when analyzing salaries of their topcorporate executives; however, the newly merged Time Warnermaintained that Time's editorial staffers would have nointerference from management.   A Time Warner spokeswoman said she was unaware of Mr.Crystal's letter to the Fortune board of editors, and said,&quot;Historically, the divisions operate independently andcorporate does not interfere.&quot; She added, &quot;the separation ofchurch and state among the magazines is a matter of historyand longstanding tradition.&quot;   In his letter, Mr. Crystal praised the &quot;editorialintegrity&quot; of Fortune, saying editors &quot;have always beenwilling to stick your neck out for an unpopular point ofview.&quot; But he said the valuations he placed on the paypackages of Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas &quot;sparked a majorreaction&quot; from corporate executives, and &quot;as a result I hadto spend a considerable amount of extra time debatingvaluation issues&quot; with the executive in charge of corporatecompensation and an assistant controller of the company.   &quot;It is this interference, this overinvolvement on the partof Time Warner's management that I can no longer accept.(After all, none of the other 199 companies in my study wereaccorded the privilege of challenging my valuationmethodology.)&quot; the letter said.   Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune, said, &quot;I canguarantee there has been no compromise whatsoever to oureditorial integrity.&quot; He noted that Mr. Crystal &quot;was pleasedwith the article after it was published, as were we,&quot; andsaid, &quot;I'm surprised and saddened that he is choosing not tocontribute to the magazine in the future.&quot;   In his letter, Mr. Crystal said his troubles in preparingthe Fortune survey began with the merger of Time and Warner.&quot;From then on, the senior management pay climate changeddramatically,&quot; Mr. Crystal said. In preparing his 1990article, &quot;I was subjected to a considerable amount ofquestioning&quot; from company officials, the letter said.   Mr. Crystal said that &quot;was merely a warm-up for whatfollowed, because in 1990 I was only describing Steve Ross'snew pay package and not evaluating him in the context of allthe other CEOs in my study.&quot; That evaluation was conducted inthe 1991 article, which Mr. Crystal said resulted in so muchscrutiny that he believed the article would actually bepulled from publication had &quot;editorial integrity&quot; notprevailed.   Mr. Crystal concluded that he would be better off movinghis analyses &quot;to more neutral ground,&quot; because he could not&quot;tone down&quot; his criticism of the pay packages being offeredat Time Warner, &quot;so long as such pay packages are so markedlyhigher than those offered by other companies of similar sizeand performance.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
