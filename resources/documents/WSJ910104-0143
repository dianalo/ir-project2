In a sweeping change from current law, banks would be ableto operate nationwide branch networks under the samecorporate umbrella with brokerage firms and possiblyinsurance companies and industrial corporations. The holdingcompanies would be barred from using federally insureddeposits to finance nonbank activities. The plan is expectedto propose measures limiting the scope of federal depositinsurance while maintaining basic coverage of $100,000 peraccount.</LP><TEXT>   The Treasury Department is still finishing the details ofa politically ambitious -- and difficult -- plan to scrap ormodify Depression-era banking laws in an effort to modernizethe nation's financial system. Elements of the proposal aresubject to change, but people who have been briefed on theplan say the administration is preparing to press for a majorchange in the way banks are organized and regulated.   At a time when the banking industry is facing fallingprofits and rising failures, the chairmen of the House andSenate Banking Committees and other members of Congress haveintroduced plans to restructure the industry and restrictdeposit insurance. But the administration's proposal willattract the most attention, partly because President Bush isexpected to make banking revision one of his top domesticpolicy goals this year. However, all proposals will triggerbanking industry infighting, opposition from insurancecompanies and other financial services, and legislative turfbattles.   Treasury officials are considering giving one agency, theComptroller of the Currency, sole regulatory authority overmost of the nation's banks, although the Federal ReserveBoard would continue to regulate the 40 or 50 largest banks,those with extensive international operations. Currently,three agencies -- the Comptroller, the Fed and the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. -- share bank regulation. However,under a plan called &quot;functional regulation,&quot; the Securitiesand Exchange Commission would supervise the broker-dealerfunction of holding companies.   The program is designed to draw more capital investmentinto the banking industry, impose stiffer market disciplineon how banks operate, limit the subsidy banks get by beingable to attract federally insured deposits, and protect basicdeposit insurance for savers.   One crucial unresolved issue is how to wean regulatorsaway from the notion that it's too risky to let big banksfail. Under a doctrine called &quot;too big to fail,&quot; thegovernment frequently has taken steps that in effect protectall deposits, even those that aren't legally covered byfederal deposit insurance.   The Treasury is looking at ways to make too-big-to-failprotection the exception rather than the rule. It'sconsidering proposing the establishment of a specialoversight board, consisting of such people as the comptrollerand the chairmen of the Fed and the FDIC and possibly theTreasury secretary, that would have to decide when to preventinsolvent institutions from closing. Under one proposal, theTreasury would bear the costs of any bailout, and then getreimbursed from the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund, which isreplenished by payments from banks.   This change would be paired with measures to giveregulators powers to intervene more quickly in the affairs ofshaky banks, in an effort to head off failures moreeffectively.   Many banking analysts, both in the government and out,contend that the government's tendency to protect alldeposits weakens market discipline by freeing big depositorsfrom worrying about the financial stability of theinstitutions that hold their money. In another effort tobring greater market discipline to banks, some administrationofficials are talking about making insurance optional on theportion of deposits over $100,000.   All banks that wanted to attract large deposits would haveto purchase additional insurance, either from the FDIC orprivate companies. Strong, well-capitalized banks would beable to purchase insurance at lower premiums than weakerbanks, thus encouraging moves toward financial soundness.   Banking legislation is emerging as a major domestic issuefacing Congress this year. Yesterday, Rep. Henry Gonzalez(D., Texas), chairman of the House Banking Committee, andOhio Rep. Chalmers Wylie, the panel's ranking Republican,each introduced his own legislative proposal to limit depositinsurance coverage, consolidate banking regulation andrequire tighter supervision. Similar plans were introduced inthe Senate last year.   The Bush administration and members of Congress aredetermined to protect the current Bank Insurance Fund, whichis financed by the banking industry, so that the governmentwouldn't have to bail out the banking industry as it'sbailing out the savings-and-loan industry, which exhaustedits insurance fund.   To bolster the bank insurance fund, Mr. Gonzalez proposedthat deposit premiums be imposed on deposits in U.S. banks'foreign branches, which are currently exempt. Large banks,many of whom rely heavily on foreign deposits, oppose thisidea, while small banks that don't have foreign depositsfavor the plan.   The Gonzalez bill would limit insurance to a maximum of$200,000-$100,000 on bank accounts and $100,000 on retirementaccounts -- and prevent the government from protectinguninsured deposits.   &quot;No insurance system can survive if it proposes tounderwrite every risk,&quot; Mr. Gonzalez said. &quot;Such a systemonly increases laxity and risky behavior with the ironicresult that it magnifies instability.&quot;   ---     Leading Administration Options for Banking Revision                                                                                                          -- Create a new class of diversified financial-serviceholding companies that would allow banks to operatenationwide branch systems under the same corporate umbrellawith brokerage firms and possibly insurance companies andindustrial corporations.                                                                                                          -- Establish &quot;fire walls&quot; between banking and nonbankingactivities so that federally insured deposits aren't used tofinance stock brokerages or other businesses.                                                                                                          -- Maintain basic deposit insurance of $100,000 peraccount, but limit coverage beyond that amount.                                                                                                          -- Consolidate regulatory authority over most of thenation's banks in a single Treasury agency -- the Comptrollerof the Currency.
