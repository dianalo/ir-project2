The method is based on measuring interplanar spacings ofcrystalline lattice. Results of the work permit to suggest that energy-dispersionmeasurement of residual stresses by means of a three-axial neutron spectrometeris less sensitive to texture anisotropy and weakening effects as comparedwith a wider used measurement by scanning. The application of the neutrondiffraction method for the first time gives the possibility of nondestructivecontrol for the distribution of near-surface residual stresses in uranium.</TEXT></DOC>
