Most come from poor families in the predominantly Hispanicsouthwest section of San Antonio. At school, in buildings in needof extensive renovation, they have had few specialized classes andfewer sports programs.   But their dropout rate is low. Their superintendent isrecognized by educators statewide. And pride pervades.   This is where the battle began to topple Texas' public schoolfinance system, to gain financial equality between rich and poordistricts, and where students, educators, lawyers and legislatorsrejoiced Monday over the unanimous Texas Supreme Court rulingdeclaring the finance system unconstitutional.   The court gave the Texas Legislature until May 1 to come up witha solution.   ``When we first began the lawsuit, nobody wanted to join withus. We were sort of the Lone Ranger,'' Edgewood SuperintendentJames Vasquez said Tuesday.   But that had never bothered this maverick district.   In 1968 Edgewood resident Demetrio Rodriguez led a group ofparents and students in suing for equality between rich and poorschool districts.   That lawsuit ended in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Courtoverturned a three-judge federal panel that had ordered the TexasLegislature to devise a constitutional funding system.   Rodriguez and others remained involved in the battle, and in1984, with the help of the Mexican American Legal Defense andEducational Fund, the district began the winning legal war with thestate.   While the school district had its doubts, Vasquez said, it neverconsidered abandoning the fight. That same determination has pushedthe district during its 84-year history, he said.   ``We've got to fight for everything we get. I think that spiritmoves us forward,'' said Vasquez, who has been with Edgewood 30years as a teacher, vice principal, principal, assistantsuperintendent and now superintendent.   The 15,500-student district is 95 percent Hispanic and covers asection of San Antonio with 87,000 residents, many of whom are pooror work at one of several nearby military bases, school boardpresident Pete Gonzales said.   Part of the district's problem has been that its property base,used to determine taxation, is mostly low-income housing ormilitary installations. Though the federal government pays thedistrict about $200,000 a year, the bases cannot be taxed.   The lack of money means Edgewood spends about $3,600 per pupilper year. Other Texas school districts spend anywhere from $2,100to $19,300 per pupil, depending on the district's tax base.   Compounding the problem, Gonzales contends, is the higherconcentration in low-income districts of students with specialneeds, meaning more money must be spent on them and even lesschanneled toward so-called ``mainstream'' students.   The school district's priorities, Vasquez said, are implementinginnovative programs to curtail the dropout rate, paying teacherscompetitive salaries and renovating buildings.   Some of the buildings need complete refurbishing and many don'thave air conditioning, which Vasquez considers a necessity in SanAntonio, where Monday's temperature reached 95 degrees.   Vasquez is proud of the school district's relatively low dropoutrate. At 23 percent, it compares favorably with the approximate 50percent average statewide for Hispanic youths.   Former Edgewood students typically stay involved with thedistrict and offer help once they are established in their careers,Vasquez said.   ``They've lived the experience, they know what it's like outthere, and they want to come back and make things better,'' thesuperintendent said. ``It's like a family.''   Vasquez has had numerous offers to go elsewhere. He has lecturedon school financing at most major Texas universities, served onstate education task forces and is co-founder of the Austin-basedEquity Center, which includes more than 200 school districts andhas its own budget and staff to study school financing.   He sees the Texas Supreme Court ruling not only as a victory forhis students but for all Texas children.   Vasquez spent much of Monday explaining to his students thatthey were part of history. But, he said, he is still trying to makehimself believe it.   ``I think that will sink into me one of these days,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
