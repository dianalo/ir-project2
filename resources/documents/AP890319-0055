In a recent exercise, all 12 of the AH-64 Apache helicoptersinvolved were incapacitated at least once within five days,according to internal Army memos obtained by the Los Angeles Times.   The problems have prompted Rep. John D. Dingell, whose staffobtained the memo, to call for an investigation by the GeneralAccounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.   ``It is unbelievable that we are fielding overly sophisticatedand outrageously expensive weapons systems for our fighting menwhich simply don't work,'' Dingell said in a letter demanding theprobe.   The Army has received 450 of the AH-64s, manufactured byMcDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. in Mesa, Ariz., for $13.4 millioneach, and plans to buy total of 975, spending $13.6 billion for thedeal.   Army and McDonnell Douglas officials dispute allegations thehelicopter is a hopeless case and defend its reliability.   But in the Army memo, Col. R. Dennis Kerr, commander of the 82ndAviation Brigade at Ft. Bragg, N.C., was highly critical of theAH-64, saying that for now at least he'd prefer to fly the AH-1, anupdated version of Bell Helicopter's 1960s-vintage Cobra, which flewin Vietnam.   ``I have been a fan of the AH-64 for over a year, but theaircraft has let me down,'' Kerr wrote to Maj. Gen. RichardStephenson, commander of the Army Aviation Systems Command in St.Louis, whose office was responsible for buying the AH-64.   ``If we went to war tomorrow, I'd have to recommend taking all ofour AH-1s before we outload one AH-64,'' Kerr wrote. ``We needhelicopters to work for at least the first 72 hours. The Apache haslong way to go to make it to the battlefield. Please help.''   The AH-64, designed to attack Soviet tanks and other armoredvehicles, experienced dozens of problems in an exercise, includingnumerous instances of jamming on its 30-millimeter machine guns,according to the memo.   Army records show that the entire fleet of AH-64s has beengrounded at least three times since the craft entered service inearly 1984. Five Apaches have been lost and flight and two more haveburned on the ground.   But Army officials said that the observation's in Kerr's memo arenot representative of other Army units.   ``The Apache is a fine airplane,'' said Col. Curtis Herrick, theAH-64 program manager in St. Louis. ``We are finding that it hasmore capability than the designers foresaw.''   Herrick acknowledged that the craft has experienced problems withits rotor blades, bearings and compressors, but said solutions havebeen found to all the problems.   Mcdonnell Douglas officials also played down the problems.   ``There are problems with any new weapon and you don't find outabout some of the problems until you field the system,'' saidcompany spokesman Rob Mack. ``We have heard both good and bad, butwe have hear a lot of good.''</TEXT></DOC>
