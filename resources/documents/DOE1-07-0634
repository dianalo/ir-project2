The hardnessvariation pattern within the temperature range of 20...600 deg C underimpact loading of a sphere indenter (initial rate of the impact is 1...3m/s) is established. Results of the studies are used to develop a procedurefor efficient hardness control of these steels at elevated temperaturedirectly under conditions of operation.</TEXT></DOC>
