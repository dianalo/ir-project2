(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A race is on between illegal artifacthunters grabbing valuable Indian tools exposed by a receding lakeand archaeologists who need the relics to piece together the puzzleof a prehistoric culture.   Despite laws making it illegal to collect artifacts on federalland, the archaeologists are losing.   ``It's like checking a book out of the library and neverbringing it back for anyone else to read,'' C. Melvin Aikens, aprofessor of anthropology at the University of Oregon, said of theloss of the artifacts. ``It's a tragedy.''   For thousands of years, ancestors of the Burns Paiute Tribe wentto the marshes of Malheur Lake in the high desert of southeasternOregon to hunt and harvest edible seeds.   They left behind exquisitely crafted points for their lances andarrows made out of obsidian, a dark volcanic glass; chips of chert,a type of rock, used to skin the muskrat they trapped in thebullrushes; and stones used to grind the seed.   For the past four years, their lakeside camps have been coveredby the highest water in recorded history on Malheur Lake, the focusof a big basin with no outlet.   The water rose nearly eight feet higher than normal, triplingthe lake in size to more than 180,000 acres and flooding ranches,roads, railroad tracks and a school.   The high water allowed waves to scour the land, washing awaythree to four feet of soil in places, and now that drought hasallowed evaporation to catch up and the lake is receding, thousandsof years worth of artifacts are being revealed.   Graves also are being exposed.   ``There is an old Indian legend about people living around thelake offended one of the spirits,'' said Dale Hile, tribal managerof the Burns Paiutes. ``A shaman cast a spell and a plague killedoff a lot of people years and years ago. The indication is thereprobably could be up to a hundred gravesites.   ``We want to get in and deal with all this before the vegetationtakes over, then the pot-hunters take the rest.''   Some newly exposed islands look as if someone scattered museumdisplays on the ground. Besides Stone Age Indian artifacts, therealso are leavings of the homesteaders who drove them out.   ``These are what you call diagnostic artifacts,'' said GeorgeConstantino, manager of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, as hestooped to examine an eight-inch obsidian point. ``When you havethose pieces, it's like you have the corners of the jigsaw puzzle.   ``These are just national-quality sites, irreplacable sites. Butthey are just going away, one piece at a time.''   Constantino has just himself and an assistant to patrol the 150miles of shoreline. He hopes to get another helper and periodicstakeouts by a federal strike team. Last summer, he cited threepeople carrying shovels who had hidden their truck in the brush,but the race still is being lost.   ``Thirteen days after we looked at this one island, we had anarchaeological crew there and someone had beat us to it,''Constantino said. ``Of the nine sites, all but two have beenpreviously collected.''   Aikens said preserving the archaeological record is much morethan just scooping up arrowheads.   ``We need to know where they were found, what else was withit,'' he said. ``If you don't know the age of the materials andwhere they came from, there is no potential to reconstruct aculture.''   ``It's the kind of thing that has to be done judiciously overthe long haul,'' he said.   An archaeological team that has spent the summer on a dig in thenearby Diamond Valley will soon begin a three-week, $10,000 surveyof sites on the lake and collect and catalog pieces on the surfacethat the illegal hunters haven't gotten yet.   But artifact hunters have become so bold that some recentlylooted the Diamond Valley dig after the archaeologists stopped forthe day, Constantino said.   ``It's everthing from grandpa and grandma to theprofessionals,'' Constantino said. ``The best ones are just ascovert as illegal drug traffickers.   ``As much as everyone wants to pick up that arrowhead and put itin their pocket, they are taking information away from thefuture,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
