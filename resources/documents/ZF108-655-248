Well, of course, there are the mice, two andthree button, standard and high resolution models.andP;  Next are the trackballs.andO;Therc are standalone, full-sized units, smaller keyboard mounted units, andeven one that is supposed to be mounted vertically, just to the fight of thekeyboard.andP;  Next is the Isopoint device, and last (for the moment) is themouse-in-a-key solution.andP;  I had a chance to try this last one at theKeytronics booth at Comdex and my first impression is that I do not like it.andO;In order to invoke it, you have to type a few keystrokes, then the letter 'M' becomes a multidirectional pivot which moves the cursor around on yourscreen.andP;  I had lots of trouble trying to open a drop down menu and even moreremembering which of the keys was acting like the mouse button in this case(it is the L).andP;  The thing that bothered me the most about this device was thetime and effort needed to get it up and running, and returning the keyboardto normal use afterward.andM;Anyway, my point is that there are many, many, different types of pointingdevices available today.andP;  The decision about which one you use will mostlikely be based on which one you try first, or which one is included in thesystem you buy.andP;  Or maybe you will end up using two different types, one onyour desktop at the office and one on your laptop while traveling.andM;Bob Frank and I passed one booth that had a display of perhaps a hundreddifferent mouse cases.andP;  They were many colors with different types ofbuttons, different shapes, with different number and locations of the buttonsand on and on.andP;  (This company obviously believes that the mouse business willbe pretty good.) Bob walked over, picked up one of these devices, turned itover and noticed that it was just a shell, no working parts in it at all.andO;This company was just selling the cases! Without hesitation, Bob dubbed thesemice 'Unixs.'andM;Windows 3.0andM;Now that the fervor has begun to settle down somewhat and we have all had achance to stand back and look at released Windows 3.0 and some of theapplications which have already become available for it, I have to say that Iam just as excited as I was on the day of announcement.andP;  I have installed iton all of the Intel-based systems I use.andP;  I am to the point of always beingin Windows 3.0, even if I am running a DOS application (I run them in the DOSwindow), and find that leaving a Windows-based application to return to acharacter base done in DOS is not something I want to do very often.andM;The one exception to this is XYWrite which I use extensively for writing.andP;  Iam so used to this command line based product that while I use AmiProfessional and Word for Windows for letters and short things, I alwaysreturn to XYWrite III for my really serious writing tasks.andP;  Part of this hasto do with the fact that I am very used to it, can type very fast using it,and have committed the commands to memory.andP;  Part of it has to do with thefact that I generally keep several different files open and move informationback and forth between them.andP;  But the biggest reason is that the filescreated by XYWrite III are ASCII files when you read them with any other wordprocessor, yet they can be output to most printers merely by changing theprint driver loaded.andP;  This also provides me with lots of flexibility inoutputting files for special purposes.andM;I hope that the folks at XYQuest are working on both a Windows and Macintoshversion of the program, but I can only hope at this point.andP;  I do not know forsure that they are doing so.andP;  (Ed.andP;  note: just as we werc going to press wereceived a notice that IBM Desktop Software had invested in a GUI technologydeveloped by XYQuest.andP;  Hopefully, this means we will be seeing XYWrite forWindows before too long.andP;  Theyare already providing this type of interface tosome OEM typesetter companies.)andM;Anyway, as soon as I have finished one of my long writing projects, I alwayshop back into Windows and move on to another task.andP;  I have found it very easyto accomplish most of the things I have to do, and copying a file orformatting a disk is so much simpler under Windows 3.0 than it ever was underDOS.andP;  I can get these tasks done in a lot shorter period of time and I do noteven have to remember any parameters.andM;Changes Due to Windows 3.0andM;I can already see that windows 3.0 is going to change the Intel computingworld for good.andP;  Things that were discovered in the Macintosh world, but notreally recognized in the Intel world, have already started to surface.andP;  Onesuch discovery, one of the most important, is the amount of hard disk spacethat you need when working with Windows.andM;A computer with a 40 MB hard drive will just not have enough disk space toprovide all of the storage required for a full set of Windows applicationsand working files.andP;  As a case in point, I am using the new Compaq 386N at themoment.andM;It came with both OS/2 and DOS installed and the DOS hard drive is 42 MB ofthe disk total.andP;  I sat down and installed Windows 3.0, Ami Professional (withall of its drawing and graphing capabilities), Microsoft Excel, IBM's Current1.1, Aldus PageMaker 3.01, and Asymetric's Toolbook.andP;  The DOS (non-Windows)applications I installed are XtreePRO Gold, Mirror (my communicationsprogram), XYWrite, and Disk Director.andP;  There was already a DOS subdirectoryon the disk.andM;The remaining file space? Less than 2 MB.andP;  I do not yet have a Windowscommunications program loaded  see below) or any of the others I would liketo have.andP;  Yes, I could unload Toolbook, since that is really an ObjectOriented Programming language, not a business application I would use everyday.andP;  But my goal is to become proficient enough with it to use it forbuilding lots of small and specialized applications.andM;My point here is that since we are dealing with a graphical user interface,and since many of the applications include graphics of their own, it is veryeasy to fill a 40 MB hard disk.andP;  So, along with 2 MB of RAM, I now think thatthe minimum desktop configuration has to include at least an 80 MB harddrive.andP;  As I said, those users who have already entered the Macintosh worldhave discovered that a 20 MB hard disk is just not enough, and most havefound that even with a 40 MB drive, you still do not have enough room to bereally comfortable.andM;As more applications that make use of graphics, store graphics images andprovide extended help files (for which there is a real need) becomeavailable, you will see disk space eaten up at an alarming rate.andP;  The aboveconfiguration did not even permit me to load PowerPoint or any of the otherWindows programs I wanted to have on this system.andP;  So, consider the size ofyour disk drive, optimize it as often as you can (to keep its speed up), backit up frequently, and maybe consider using a second hard drive or hardcardtype of product to store some of the programs and/or files you do not accessvery often.andM;June: The MonthandM;It is a good thing June only comes once a year.andP;  With Comdex/Spring and PCExpo both in the same month and many, many new products being announced,there is time for little else, including work.andP;  Trying to keep up with all ofthis is fun, but also hectic.andP;  I have just spent a solid week in meetingswith various vendors looking at their new products, products which will beannounced later this month or later this year, and products which have beenmodified or changed in some way which makes them newsworthy again.andP;  I do notremember when I have been so deluged with products and product announcements.andO;I guess one way to measure how busy a given month is may be to measure thestack of press releases we get.andP;  A typical month in our office will sec about38 to 42 inches of press materials arrive for reviewing, discarding, filing,and use.andP;  We discard all of the ones which deal with Joe Smith being promotedto third Vice-President if we reported on all of these promotions, and movesyou would not be able to heft an issue of this newsletter.)andM;We also get some of the strangest press releases from the strangest sourcesyou can imagine.andP;  I still do not know how we got on Heublen's mailing list,unless they check my purchases at the local liquor store.andP;  We getannouncements regarding their new products, but unfortunately they do notsend along either evaluation units or free samples like most of the hardwareand software vendors we deal with.andP;  Wonder why...andP;  Back to the issue at hand,by June 20 our stack of press releases is standing at 67 inches! I think thatthis might be a record for any one month and it is not over yet.andP;  Of course,some of that can be attributed to the Windows 3.0 announcement, some toComdex, and some to PC Expo.andP;  But we still received many more productannouncements this month than we normally do in any other given month.andM;It is going to continue to be a very interesting year.andP;  Not only is Windowsgoing to have a great impact, but prices of systems will continue to fall.andP;  Iwas really surprised to find that AST has already announced price reductionson their i486-based units.andP;  Albeit they are minor in nature when compared tothe retail prices, but they are price cuts just the same.andP;  Most companies arenot even shipping i486-based products in any quantity and along comes ASTwith price reductions which range from $200 on an $11,000 system to $1800 ona $16,000 unit.andP;  It is going to take a while for prices on these systems tosettle in, what with the short supply of i486 chips and an unsure demand.andP;  Ibelieve that these price reductions are more of a &quot;tweaking&quot; nature by ASTthan a reflection of actual cost reductions.andP;  AST has always been a fairlyconservative company, and certainly not one to rush out in front of the pack.andO;(At the Windows event they announced support for Windows 3.0, but did not saythat they were going to bundle it, preferring, instead, to wait and see whatthe rest of the vendors did.)andM;Hyundai also announced price decreases.andP;  Joe Reid, Vice-President ofmarketing and Sales, really put it into perspective when he noted that, Today, we are able to offer our low-end 80286 AT-compatible, the Super-286Efor  50 less than the starting price of our XT compatible one year ago.' Thenew list price for the entry level Super-286E is $945.andP;  Their new 25 MHzSuper-386N starts at $3595, the Super-386S (an 80386SX-based system) has beenreduced to $1445 for a single floppy unit, while the price has been loweredto $2945 on a unit with a 100 MB hard drive.andP;  They have also reduced priceson their other products and the XT compatible Joe mentioned in the quoteabove starts at $645 for a single floppy version.andP;  I always thought thatHyundai could save lots of money shipping their systems by filling each carwith systems and having the truck driver stop by the computer stores on theirway to the car dealerships.andM;These are just two of the companies that are continuing to place pressure onthe market.andP;  The 286 systems are becoming the bottom end of the market veryquickly.andP;  With the availability of the 386SX at 20 MHz, we should also see avery rapid drop in the price of the 386SX 16 MHz-based systems.andM;Speed MeasurementsandM;As any of you who read this newsletter on a regular basis are aware, althoughwe run all of the systems we check though the standard speed comparisonprograms, we do not use these as a finite measure of performance.andP;  We prefer,instead, to use a set of applications and files which more accurately showthe throughput or performance which an end-user can expect to achieve.andM;However, we will never, ever be able to get away from some form ofperformance and speed testing and it is helpful to set up guidelines formeasuring machines with like CPUs installed.andP;  Tests like Norton's systemIndex, which are based on the old PC-XT model for comparison, no longer arevery relevant.andP;  So, here are some thoughts I have had regarding the upgradingof these tests.andM;First, let's set the new standard of measurement at the level of a 386SXsystem, going both up and down from there.andP;  Maybe we should use a system thatcan be defined and benchmarked that is made by IBM, or maybe one of Compaq'sunits should be used instead.andP;  Let's pick a 386SX unit as the &quot;standard&quot;measure, but then let's add a new wrinkle to testing performance.andP;  Let mecheck the system I USE everyday, you know, the one that sits on my desk andthat I have tweaked to the peak of its performance, the one I know and love.andO;Let's say that I benchmark it against the new standard, but also, by menuselection, I am able to substitute my own system as the standard againstwhich all of the others are compared! I think that this would provide us allwith a much more meaningful way of running tests of this type of product.andO;Any takers?andM;Speaking of CommunicatingandM;Some of you have joined us for the first time this month.andP;  We welcome you andwould like to have your input.andP;  We are always looking for ways to improvewhat we do, and are very interested in problems, solutions, comments, or justyour impressions of a topic or specific application or piece of hardware.andM;We are available by a number of different methods.andP;  The tried and true, ofcourse, is the US Postal Service and our address is: 3235 Kifer Road, Suite350, Santa Clara, CA 95051.andP;  Ma Bell works too at 408-746-2555 or try a FAXto 408-746-2448 (we get so much fax traffic now that we have two machines onrotary lines and it is not unusual for both machines to be receiving faxes atthe same time).andP;  If you are into E-mail, you can try OUTLOOK on MCI Mail,ASEYBOLD on AppleLink, ASEYBOLD on ATandamp;T Mail, ASEYBOLD on Prodigy, 73277,1234on CompuServe, on IBMLink: Node Hone81, ID CR00023, or via our own BBS at408-737-7862 and soon on PCLink.andP;  If any of you happen to be ham radiooperators and have a packet system, you can reach me (W8GEC) @W8GEC BBS.andP;  Inother words, if you want to reach us, there are certainly enough ways, bothmanual and electronic, in which to do so.andP;  We check into most of the servicesat least twice a week, and MCI Mail, AppleLink and our own BBS every day.andP;  Sogive it a try, reach for your computer and dial us up, we would really loveto hear from you-Until next month, happy computing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
