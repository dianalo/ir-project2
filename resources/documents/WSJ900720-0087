Gigot</HL><DATE>07/20/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   George Bush didn't get the civil rights bill he wantedfrom the Senate this week, but not for lack of trying.   Mr. Bush claimed to want &quot;desperately&quot; to sign a bill, andhis opponents sensed his political hunger. They held theirpositions, while Mr. Bush gave more ground than the ItalianAfrica corps. He stopped just short of acceptingunconditional surrender in the form of racial quotas. Mr.Bush's reputed homeland -- the ground of equal opportunity,not equal outcomes -- looks ravaged nonetheless.</LP><TEXT>   The Kennedy-Hawkins bill that passed the Senate 65-34illustrates the growing failure of the White House politicalstrategy of splitting the difference with Congress. Mr. Bushis doing all the splitting. Chief of Staff John Sununu &quot;dideverything but jump through hoops&quot; to get a deal with Sen.Ted Kennedy, say several Senate sources. His pre-emptiveconcessions even undercut an anti-quota alternative by Sen.Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) that was drawing Democrats.   Mr. Bush wants a bill -- he doesn't want to veto anythinglabeled &quot;civil rights&quot; -- but Democrats want both a campaignissue and a bill. Black voters are a core Democraticconstituency, their last one other than unions. The thoughtof Mr. Bush getting 20% of the black vote in 1992 terrifiesthem. Even a veto threat provides welcome publicity. So Mr.Kennedy kept waiting, and Mr. Sununu kept giving.   The two thought they had a deal last week, until Mr.Kennedy reneged Monday. Mr. Sununu called a press conferenceto complain, but he was still willing to carry one moreconcession back to the Hill. President Bush even put in apersonal call to Majority Leader George Mitchell's officeTuesday night to urge the senators on. But Mr. Kennedy wassaying privately he had no reason to compromise. He figuresthe White House will return with more concessions after theHouse passes a similar bill this summer.   This is also the strategy of the civil-rights industry --now more conglomerate than cause -- and its curly-haired CEORalph Neas. Mr. Neas has an engaging public demeanor thatmasks an iron fist. He's his own good cop-bad cop. Hechoreographed this week's moves for Democrats, much as he didthe Bork and Lucas nomination fights.   He and his allies spurned the usual Senate reception roomand massed, like a panel of judges, just outside the Senatechamber. When their troops -- the senators -- won a vote tocut off debate, they gave a cheer that carried halfway acrossthe Capitol. Mr. Neas thinks he has George Bush rolled, too.   &quot;Kennedy wasn't running this show,&quot; says a White Housenegotiator. &quot;We'd think we had a deal, then he'd come backand there'd be no deal. These civil rights groups want all ornothing.&quot;   What they want is to bring civil-rights lawsuits into thetrial lawyers' lottery. Heretofore, damages in bias suitshave been aimed at reconciliation -- reinstatement and backpay. Kennedy-Hawkins opens the door to sky's-the-limitjudgments. More lawsuits will be filed, many of themfrivolous, and employers accused of bias will want to settlerather than gamble on a multi-million dollar payment. Thiswill enrich the civil-rights bar, though how it will serveracial harmony is a mystery.   The entire bill is a lawyers' feast. No one else canunderstand it. Weeks of debate have focused on legal jargonlike &quot;business necessity&quot; or the &quot;Griggs&quot; decision. Yet it'scrucial jargon because the civil-rights lobby has based itsentire strategy on the courts. Lawsuits, not economicself-help or education, are its thing. But suits are bluntinstruments, even in a good cause.   The Kennedy-Hawkins language puts the legal burden onemployers to prove in court that they didn't discriminate --simply because they may have hired fewer Hispanics or womenthan in the surrounding population. So any sane employer whowants to avoid a suit will simply hire by statistics -- byusing quotas. Mr. Sununu's compromises would have ceded toomuch of the Kennedy language.   Everyone claims to hate quotas, of course, and Mr. Kennedyeven put in a clause saying the bill doesn't &quot;require&quot; them.But, as Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) points out, this is&quot;worse than phony.&quot; The issue is whether the incentives inthe bill make it all but certain that employers will usequotas in practice.   Just how much all of this has strayed from the originalcivil rights vision is clear enough from a letter Mr. Bushreceived last month from Morris Abram. Mr. Abram is a hero ofthe original civil-rights days who argued the one-man,one-vote case before the Supreme Court. He didn't release theletter, but a copy was obtained by the Forward, a Jewishweekly.   Mr. Abram wrote that Kennedy-Hawkins &quot;is not a civilrights bill but a quota bill because it will achieveprecisely what the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act stoodfour-square against.&quot; He added, &quot;Abraham Lincoln's greatfriend Frederick Douglass understood the divisive anddestructive influence of proportional representation based onrace. `Equality of numbers,' he wrote in 1871, `has nothingto do with equality of attainments.'&quot;   Mr. Bush agrees with this philosophy, because he quotedthat last passage in a speech this Wednesday. If he pressedthese arguments, maybe Ted Kennedy would be making theconcessions.</TEXT></DOC>
