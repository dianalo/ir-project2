(products).andO;Product:   Knowledgeman/2 2.6 (Computer program).andO;Topic:     Integrated SoftwareEvaluationData Communications.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MDBS Inc.andM;KNOWLEDGEMAN/2 2.6andM;At the heart of KnowledgeMan/2 is a powerful database-management system builtaround a relational data model, with a central data dictionary and acomprehensive programming language using a subset of Structured QueryLanguage (SQL).andP;  In this regard, KnowledgeMan/2 compares favorably with anystand-alone database-management system.andM;However, the spreadsheet and text-processing components lack the full set ofexpected features, and serve only as auxiliary aids in manipulating,analyzing and reporting data extracted from the database.andM;The spreadsheet and database are very well-integrated.andP;  Copying values fromdatabase tables into a spreadsheet is controlled by SQL-like statements thatcan specify column names and criteria for record selection.andP;  Within thespreadsheet, however, the capabilities for manipulating data are fairlylimited.andP;  The lack of financial functions is particularly glaring.andM;The text-processing facilities are minimal -- so lacking that MDBS officialsdo not even claim that the module is a word processor.andP;  Basically,KnowledgeMan/2 includes a text editor most useful for writing programs.andO;Formatting, such as word wrapping and margins, is controlled through commandsembedded in the text; the effect is not visible until the document isprinted.andM;KnowledgeMan/2 is not the integrated package that will make life easy for thenovice end user.andP;  Rather, it is a professional-caliber development tool fordatabase applications that also require light-duty spreadsheet,text-processing and communications capabilities.andM;MDBS Inc., of Lafayette, Ind., can be reached at (317) 463-2581.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;By purchasing KnowledgeMan/2, CIS Technologies Inc. received a &quot;robust&quot;programming language as well as a database with a full, built-in text editor,debugger and screen-building system, according to Mac Gravette, director ofoperations for the Tulsa, Okla., health insurance claims clearinghouse.andM;&quot;Within the K-man file structure you are limited to 64,000 files per recordor characters per field, and that is an astronomical limit,&quot; said Gravette.andO;&quot;K-man places no artificial limits on the program size or the amount of datait can handle.&quot;andM;Because KnowledgeMan/2 can be integrated well with C, Gravette is able todevelop programs entirely within KnowledgeMan/2 or in C.andM;&quot;I can develop applications on the PC when I'm at home, dial in to themainframe with a modem and send the code that I have been developing to themainframe, and it will run,&quot; said Gravette.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
