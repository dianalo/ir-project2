At a forum on issues affecting families, Democratic Gov. JamesBlanchard of Michigan, temporary chairman of the 163-memberplatform committee, said the party should capitalize on an issue hesays Republicans have neglected.   ``We have a good record of family issues ... (while) theRepublicans have spent the last eight years trying to regulate ourbedrooms and tell us what prayers to pray,'' Blanchard said.   Republicans, he said, have gutted programs affecting low-incomefamilies, the young and the elderly, while Americans see a need forsuch programs.   However, Blanchard added, Democrats must convince voters suchinitiatives are financially feasible.   Friday's forum was the last of four held this week on issues thecommittee felt were key to winning the election. Earlier regionalforums dealt with jobs and the economy, education and youth, andforeign policy and defense.</TEXT></DOC>
