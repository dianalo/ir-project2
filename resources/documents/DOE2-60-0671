<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0671 </DOCNO><TEXT>A large number of critical process parameters in nuclear power plantshave hitherto been monitored using electromechanical chart recorders.The reducing costs of electronics systems have led to a trend towardsmodernizing power plant control rooms by computerizing all the panelinstrumentation. As a first step, it has been decided to develop a digitalrecording system to record the values of 48 process parameters. The systemas developed and described in this report is more than a replacementfor recorders; it offers substantial advantages in terms of lower overallsystem cost, excellent time resolution, accurate data and absolute synchronizationfor correlated signals. The system provides high speed recording of 48process parameters, maintains historical records and permits retrievaland display of archival information on a colour monitor, a plotter anda printer. It is implemented using a front end data acquisition unitconnected on a serial link to a PC-XT computer with 20 MB Winchester.The system offers an extremely user friendly man machine interaction,based on a hierarchical paged menu driven scheme. Softwre developmentfor this system has been carried out using the C language. (author).9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
