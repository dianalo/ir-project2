Botha, who isrecovering from a stroke he suffered two weeks ago, resigned todayas the leader of the governing National Party but said he will stayon as the nation's president.   Botha, 73, told party officials in a letter that he was resigningthe party post to concentrate on his presidential duties and todistance the presidency from partisan politics, state radio reported.   The National Party's parliamentary caucus chose NationalEducation Minister F.W. de Klerk to replace Botha as party leader.   At a news conference in Cape Town today, de Klerk declined todiscuss his political agenda. He appears to favor Botha's policiesof limited and gradual reform of South Africa's apartheid system ofracial separation.   The party parliamentary caucus chose de Klerk by a vote of 69-61over Finance Minister Barend du Plessis, who is considered slightlymore moderate, said the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp.   Other contenders _ including Foreign Minister Pik Botha and theacting president, Constitutional Develpoment Minister Chris Heunis _were eliminated in early rounds of balloting, according to stateradio.   Botha became party leader in 1978 when he was elected primeminister. He became president in 1984 under a new constitution thatabolished the post of prime minister.   South Africa's president is selected by the political party thatcontrols Parliament, which opens this year's session Friday in CapeTown.   Botha has refused to discuss his possible retirement but has saidduring the past year he would consider reducing his work load.   A bill has been introduced to revive the post of prime ministerto share leadership duties with the president.   Botha is recovering from his stroke at his private residence inCape Town and takes daily walks in his garden, his doctors say.   The stroke weakened Botha's left arm and left leg, and he willneed at least one more month of rest before he can considerreturning to work, the doctors said today.   As education minister, de Klerk, 52, has not been associated withany major reforms. He supported a controversial crackdown onanti-apartheid dissent at universities and has tried to haltdefections from the National Party to the extreme-right ConservativeParty.   De Klerk said today that if he wanted to propose any policychanges as head of the National Party, ``I would like first to havea discussion with the state president.''   ``A very special relationship will now have to develop betweenmyself as leader-in-chief of the National Party on the one hand andthe state president as chief executive on the other hand,'' he saidat the news conference.   De Klerk declined to answer directly when asked if his selectionas party leader made him the logical successor to Botha. He notedthat his position had ``no direct or formal constitutionalimplications.''   The independent South African Press Association said, however,that de Klerk's selection as party leader ``is a firm indicatorthat, should President Botha resign, he would succeed him.''   The president is chosen after national elections are held.   There was widespread speculation Botha would call for an electionin April, but his stroke makes such a ballot unlikely until laterthis year, observers say.   The National Party, which codified apartheid legislation aftercoming to power in 1948, has ruled uninterrupted since then and isexpected to maintain power in the next election.   Other contenders to succeed Botha as president include Heunis, duPlessis, Pik Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malan.   All appear to favor Botha's policies of gradual race reform,although Pik Botha is considered slightly more liberal than theothers.</TEXT></DOC>
