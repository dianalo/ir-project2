She says her former husband found bones here -- &quot;big bones&quot;-- while digging out the garden. She says she always wondered why this paleyellow house on a quiet hillside street stood vacant for two years. Only longafter she moved in did the neighbors confess what they had been afraid to tellher before: that the house once belonged to a mass murderer.;    As Materadescribes this, she eyes her yard fondly. This is where her 8-year-old sonplays and where she enjoys stretching out on her hammock. It's all right, sheexplains; the mass murderer butchered all his victims somewhere else. As faras she knows.;    &quot;But I hope there's at least one dead body under here,&quot; sheadds, as if more than one body is too much to hope for.;    I'm here to dig upa mystery, but it's probably not buried under Lia Matera's lawn. The puzzle iswhy Northern California has spawned not just Matera but Marcia Muller, JulieSmith, Sue Dunlap, Gloria White, Janet Dawson, Susan Wolfe, Linda Grant, JanetLaPierre, Jaqueline Girdner, Gillian Roberts, Alice Storey, Shelley Singer,Marilyn Wallace, Karen Kijewski. . . . There are about 30 women in all whohave published mystery novels, many of them just in the last few years. It'sgot to be the largest concentration of criminally minded women writers in thecountry.;    &quot;In the world,&quot; says Ruth Cavin, senior editor at St. Martin'sPress, laughing. Some New York publishers have even taken to joking aboutthese women as the Northern California Mafia. After all, every single one ofthem has murdered and most of them have done it repeatedly. They've beeningenious about it, too.;    One of Lia Matera's victims succumbed to apoisonous hemlock garnish on his mousse in a trendy San Francisco restaurant.In Sue Dunlap's Diamond in the Buff, a man was assaulted by a eucalyptusbranch in the Berkeley Hills while another sailed to his death on a loungechair off a lofty redwood deck. These women have murdered in San Francisco,Oakland and Alameda, on the San Mateo coast, in Marin County and theSacramento Delta, as well as in a host of other thinly disguised NorthernCalifornia towns. Palo Alto lawyer Susan Wolfe set her first book, theaward-winning Last Billable Hour, in Silicon Valley.;    There is often apeculiarly Bay Area twist to their plots and characters -- Matera's sleuthWilla Jansson is a lawyer who grows up in Haight-Ashbury with radical parents,smokes dope, and bears a grudge against the man who gave her herpes. ButBerkeley writer Julie Smith recently killed someone off on a float in the NewOrleans Mardi Gras at the hands of a Dolly Parton look-alike. The book, NewOrleans Mourning, just won an Edgar Award for best novel, making Smith thefirst American woman to win in that category of the award for mystery writerssince 1959.;    WHEN MARILYN WALLACE, A SAN ANSELMO mystery writer, decided in1986 to compile the first volume of Sisters in Crime -- an annual anthology ofshort stories by female crime writers -- she had about 22 authors to choosefrom. &quot;I'd say conservatively there are 100 now,&quot; says Wallace, who iscompleting the fourth volume of Sisters in Crime this year.;    &quot;My theory ofwomen mystery writers hangs around the social changes of the '60s and '70s,&quot;Wallace says. Northern California drew women who wanted to make politicalchange. &quot;Women who write mysteries -- and who create protagonists who takerisks and function on their own -- share some of the same values.&quot;;    Inpreparing her anthologies, Wallace has become something of a detective-fictionhistorian. She notes that mysteries used to be dominated by American men andBritish women. American men wrote tough private-eye fiction. &quot;The wholelineage of Hammett and Chandler presents a very bitter protagonist who isfiercely self-protective and has problems with interpersonal relations.&quot;;   British women, on the other hand, were known for writing cozies with amateursleuths, like the village mysteries of Agatha Christie. &quot;There was not a longand venerable tradition for American women,&quot; Wallace found, though there werealways some getting published, including Margaret Millar and Dorothy SalisburyDavis. Other American women, like Martha Grimes and Elizabeth Peters, achievedsuccess by imitating the British, setting their mysteries in the same Englishvillages.;    But now two of the hottest writers of tough private-eye fictionare women: Sara Paretsky, whose Scotch-swilling Chicago-based female p.i.,V.I. Warshawski, is being played by Kathleen Turner in a new movie. And SueGrafton, whose flinty Kinsey Millhone goes through crimes in alphabeticalorder. Grafton hit the best-seller list on G Is for Gumshoe; her H Is forHeroes is already selling like pistols.;    &quot;Some of the success of SaraParetsky and Sue Grafton is that they did seem to be direct descendants of theAmerican tradition. Publishers knew how to place them and how to sell them,&quot;says Wallace. The Bay Area's most successful female mystery writer so far,Marcia Muller, is in that same tradition. &quot;Marcia is the first of the modernfemale writers in a lot of ways,&quot; Wallace says. &quot;She opened things up.&quot;;   &quot;WE'RE GOING TO Seacliff.&quot; Marcia Muller shoots out from the curb in her redHonda Prelude. Sandy-haired and lightly freckled, she looks, in spite of ablazing orange shirt, downright wholesome. We are heading to Seacliff, one ofSan Francisco's poshest neighborhoods, because Muller -- who has just drivendown from her home in Sonoma -- chose it as the setting for the next scene inher new novel, the one that will follow Trophies and Dead Things.;    Thiswill be the 13th Sharon McCone mystery and Muller's 20th book. Her book coversinclude this blurb from Sue Grafton: &quot;Marcia Muller is the founding 'mother'of the contemporary female hard-boiled private eye.&quot;;    Muller's SharonMcCone totes both a gun and a sense of humor. And, unlike Lew Archer, sheworries about what kind of person she's becoming when she's forced to shoot.But she does shoot when she has to. Which is strange, because Muller herselflooks about as dangerous as a pleased pixie.;    Like many of the womenwriting in the Bay Area, Muller gives her books a Northern California spin.Sharon McCone works out of a very San Francisco-style law practice called AllSouls Legal Cooperative. &quot;The law cooperative is over there,&quot; Muller says witha vague wave toward a cluster of Victorian houses facing a triangle of greengrass in Bernal Heights. &quot;I thought this is better than having Sharon workalone in a seedy downtown office with a bottle in a drawer.&quot; She swervesthrough an intersection and mutters at a Muni bus.;    &quot;Sharon McCone is mybest friend. She's really me, except I took out my undesirable traits. She'sbraver than me and she doesn't gain weight,&quot; Muller says as we swing intoSeacliff. The scene she is writing requires some open space, not a notablecommodity in this neighborhood where multimillion-dollar mansions bump upagainst each other like common tenements. Muller wants to see what corner shemight conveniently make vacant. She explains that long ago she learned auseful trick: to imagine herself in a scene, by describing how things looked,sounded, smelled. She has brought along a camera and a tape recorder for herresearch. She calls this work.;    &quot;I've maneuvered my whole life not to haveto commute or dress up for work,&quot; she confesses cheerfully. She once fed hermystery writing habit by working as a Kelly Girl, later as a ghostwriterpartnered with Julie Smith. But she's supported herself with her mysteriessince 1983. &quot;Since then I haven't set an alarm clock.&quot;;    Still, it hasn'tbeen quite as easy as it looks and her persistence is testimony to a toughnessof purpose that she passed on to Sharon McCone. Though an editor once told herhe could sell any book set in San Francisco, it took Muller five years to gether first novel published in 1977. Although it sold well, she says, &quot;I'm notsure they saw it as more than a novelty.&quot; This was when women were justbeginning to become lawyers and police officers in large numbers in real life,and many of them were still seen as a novelty, too. It took Muller four yearsafter that to find a publisher for her second book. Meanwhile, the firstadvance was so generous that she used up half of it fixing her car.;    Duringthe stretch between her first and second novels, Muller took a UC Extensionclass on mystery writing. Who should be in it but Sue Dunlap and MickeyFriedman (who has since moved to New York and published). Julie Smith hadtaken the same class the year before. &quot;It's a very incestuous little group,&quot;Muller says. What they had in common was that they had all grown up readingmysteries.;    The car slows to a crawl as we pass the corner she has used ina first draft of the vacant lot scene. &quot;Maybe I picked the wrong place and Iought to move it over a few blocks,&quot; she worries. She's creating the lot, sheexplains, because she has imagined that a house figuring in a murder case oncestood on it. She will make the house burn down. &quot;Sometimes I'm amazed at howmuch power I have,&quot; she admits, and laughs. &quot;I took the entire town near MonoLake and moved it up higher in the Sierra in order to avoid a libel suit.&quot;;   Even after publishing book after book in hardback and establishing afollowing, most of Muller's works were allowed to go out of print. &quot;I couldnot get anyone to do the books in paperback except people with printingpresses in their garages.&quot; But that changed when Paretsky and Grafton zoomedonto the best-seller lists. &quot;The success of people like Sue Grafton and SaraParetsky I think really made publishers sit up and take notice.&quot; Now, Muller'sbooks have been re-released in paperback and she's signed a large contract toproduce more. She's being promoted all over the country. &quot;I spent 13 yearsbecoming an overnight success,&quot; she says with a laugh.;    &quot;Oh, look at that!&quot;We stop across from a boxy stucco structure that attaches to a huge brickEnglish Tudor. The stucco looks as if it were dropped in from Encino. Mulleris delighted. &quot;That's obviously going to have to be the one that burns down!&quot;Out comes the tape recorder. &quot;We've got three ugly modern buildings that aregoing to be not there . . . it's on the upward slope of the street.&quot; She putsdown the recorder. &quot;I love it when things work out.&quot;;    And things areworking out even faster for some of those who have followed her. Muller says,&quot;One thing that pulled women in was reading books by other women.&quot; Teachers,social workers, lawyers, newspaper reporters, bartenders, housewives -- womenwho had always read mysteries began furiously to scribble them.;    &quot;SUEGRAFTON, SARA PARETSKY AND Marcia Muller are probably the three leadingpractitioners of the woman p.i. novel,&quot; says agent Dominick Abel, whospecializes in mystery writers. &quot;But people like Lia Matera and Sue Dunlap,the people of that generation, are enjoying a greater amount of success soonerthan Marcia Muller.&quot;;    That's partly because the whole mystery genre isdoing so well, with some authors consistently producing best sellers. And it'spartly because publishers now have discovered that women mystery readers --and women have always read mysteries in large numbers -- like to read aboutwomen as protagonists and not just as victims. It's harder to publish aromance novel now than a mystery.;    In fact, in mysteries right now, &quot;Isuspect it's probably easier to be a bad woman writer and get published thanit is to be a bad male writer and get published,&quot; Abel says. &quot;But that's notsaying anything. There are always bad writers being published.&quot;;    Abel isnot alone in believing that there is already a glut of p.i. books, includingfemale private eyes. &quot;The tendency at the moment,&quot; he says, &quot;is to look forsofter, more character-driven novels.&quot;;    The first women sleuths were sohard that V.I. (&quot;Vic&quot;) Warshawski and Kinsey Millhone could be men. They carryguns (Warshawski also has a black belt in karate) and get shot withoutworrying about scars; they swear like sailors and go to bed on the first datewithout worrying about getting pregnant. But a lot of the female detectiveswho have followed are softer -- amateur sleuths with complicated relationshipsto old boyfriends, with nagging mothers who phone at inopportune moments, andmore self-doubts. They don't just stumble over yet another body, MissMarple-like, without rattling a tea cup. They worry about what the fact thatthey are always stumbling over bodies says about them as people. In fact, alot of the books are funnier than mysteries used to be because the femaleprotagonists don't take themselves so seriously. But the subject matter can bevery solemn indeed; they increasingly deal with issues like mental illness,child abuse, and the social movements of the '60s in ways once reserved forso-called serious novels.;    It may not only be women writers who areresponsible, but they are contributing to the soft-boiling of the Americandetective novel. &quot;The relationships and characters play a bigger role. This istrue of mysteries in the '80s. The lone wolf individual who works on his ownis really out of it now. Even the men have aunts and brothers,&quot; says LindaGrant, Berkeley author of Random Access Murders and Blind Trust. &quot;You don'tfind as much violence in women's books, even in books involving jeopardy. Ourviolence tends to be off stage.&quot; Yet the plots follow one basic rule: &quot;Theseare books where the men do not save the women.&quot;;    GRANT, WHOSE REAL NAME ISLINDA WILLIAMS, was a high school teacher when she got this idea around 1983-- &quot;me and 5,000 other people&quot; -- that she'd like to &quot;write a femaleinvestigator.&quot; Her no-frills gray hair hangs simply around her face andthere's a no-nonsense look in the blue eyes. She can be as funny as a stand-upcomic, yet she's tough enough to have spent time with a juvenile officer whileresearching the subject of child sexual abuse for her newest novel, which shedescribes as a book &quot;that's really about betrayal.&quot;;    Grant's first steptoward becoming a mystery writer was to attend conferences held for detectiveauthors and their fans, where she discovered &quot;there was a tremendous hunger&quot;among women readers. &quot;We all grew up with Nancy Drew. When we outgrew her whowas there, Miss Marple? Girls could be adventuresome up until their teens.That stopped at 20. Then, at old age you had the English spinsters whodetected.&quot;;    Twenty or 30 years ago, the women writing today's mysterieswere reading Nancy Drew, whose boyfriend regularly rode to her rescue. Theywere just entering adolescence in an era when the message delivered by bookswas clear-cut: Boys and men got to have adventures. Later, when they snuck theadult mysteries with the lurid covers off their parents' shelves to learnabout the world, mostly what they learned was that the world was too dangerousa place for a woman to roam unprotected. And that some of the very men whoprotected women basically held them in contempt.;    It made some girls angry.And the girls grew up. And some of them turned their anger into changing theplot.;    &quot;It has annoyed me for years to see these shows where the man hashis hands tied behind his back and the woman character stands there anddoesn't do anything,&quot; Grant complains. In her books, a series based on a womanwho specializes in solving white-collar crime, Grant explores the same issueshe thinks draws her readers to seeking out female detectives: &quot;A lot ofwomen's mysteries come from the fact that the world is not safe for women. Ifyou face that it can cripple you. How do you remain feminine in this unsafeenvironment and not allow this to set limits on what you want to do?&quot;;    THEHUNGER OF WOMEN READERS WAS one thing; getting booksellers and book reviewersto recognize it was something else. In keeping with their own protagonists,the women who write crime novels didn't leave these things to the men,either.;    In 1986, at a mystery writers convention, Sara Paretsky called thewomen authors together over breakfast and formed Sisters in Crime, a group todiscuss problems they were having, the chief one at that time being to getreviewed. They didn't threaten to bump anyone off; they just sent a politeletter to the New York Times pointing out that the year before, only 14percent of the 88 mysteries reviewed by the Times were written by women. Theyfound other ways of promoting their membership (which now also includes men).They published a publicity guide called &quot;Shameless Promotion for BrazenHussies.&quot;;    Not all women writers, not even all the members of Sisters inCrime, are comfortable with publicity based on gender. Some even wonderwhether it is &quot;moral&quot; to belong to a group based on gender. Mystery writers,who after all write about morality, turn out to be surprisingly idealistic.But they also want to sell books, and Sisters in Crime has worked.;    &quot;Womenare not socialized to promote themselves. Sisters in Crime has given us avehicle for promotion,&quot; says Sue Dunlap, who took part in the originalbreakfast and served as national president out of her Albany home this year.&quot;The change that's happened in the last five years is the number of books bywomen being published,&quot; she says. &quot;Those women who came before us were justkind of lost.&quot;;    Although females wrote crime fiction even as far back atthe Civil War, Dunlap points out that until World War II most wrote under malenames and about male characters. After that, they used their own names butthey were still writing about men. Until recently &quot;people were willing to readbooks written by women, but not about women.&quot;;    Dunlap, who began writing in1972, was a part-time Alameda County social worker until she got publishedeight years later. It was the seventh book she'd written. A Canadianpublishing house bought it for $3,500 but before it ever saw print, theycanceled their mystery line. &quot;This book has stood me in good stead. I sold itto another Canadian publishing house which distributed it wherever two orthree moose came together.&quot;;    When that house went out of business, she wasfree to sell the rights once again. Dell is bringing it out in August underthe title Karma, along with her entire back list. For the past few years,she's finally making more than she did half-time at the welfare office.;    Sopeople like Dunlap were writing at the right time and for the right audienceand they learned how to promote themselves. But why the Bay Area? Why somany?;    &quot;People who are willing to try something new move west,&quot; is Dunlap'stheory. &quot;This area gives people more freedom to try things. Having nine peopleto go to lunch with didn't hurt anything either.&quot;;    REGULARLY, MARCIAMULLER, LIA Matera, Sue Dunlap, Julie Smith, Janet LaPierre, Shelley Singer,Linda Grant, Judy Greber, Sarah Shankman and Marilyn Wallace get together forlunch. They drink too much wine and complain and gossip. They talk about theirart, a word most of them use a little self-consciously. They swap advice onagents and publishers, contracts and publicity. Some of them trade manuscriptswith each other to review. When Lia Matera was going through what one of herfriends describes as &quot;the divorce from hell,&quot; the lunch group took it uponthemselves to take turns sending her witty post cards, one a day for twomonths, to help her get through it. When Julie Smith was nominated for theEdgar, every single member of the lunch group immediately phoned to offercongratulations.;    They help each other. Instead of viewing each other onlyas competitors, they believe that there are enough insatiable mystery readersto go around. In a way that's unusual for writers, they are a community. Thiscommunity got them through years of return envelopes stuffed with rejectedmanuscripts that defeated isolated writers in other places.;    &quot;It's really avery generous group. A lot of us suffered a long time together,&quot; says JulieSmith. In fact, Smith just moved back to Berkeley from Santa Barbara. &quot;I hadSue Grafton in Santa Barbara. I saw her every day . . . But I like having thegroup. I like to have a lot of people to call when I'm putting off writing.&quot;She shakes a head of red curls and smiles.;    It's easy for Smith to smilethese days, with an Edgar that's bound to boost her books -- she already soldthe Japanese and French rights to New Orleans Mourning just after beingnominated. But, like the others, she was hardly an overnight success. A formerreporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, she wrote mysteries nine yearsbefore she published Death Turns a Trick in 1982, the start of her RebeccaSchwartz series. She also wrote a series about a male detective, a newspaperreporter named Paul McDonald. &quot;An agent I had then suggested maybe nobody wasinterested in female protagonists.&quot; She laughs, but not happily. She has sinceswitched agents. &quot;I think I've stopped the Paul McDonald series now becausethey weren't very successful. It turned out nobody wanted to read a womanwriting about a man.;    &quot;If you wrote as a woman in those days it had to be acozy, and mine are not.&quot; And Smith makes a wry face. In fact, she resented thebooks she read by women who allowed their heroines always to be rescued byboyfriends. There is a tough edge to Smith's books. She grew up in the Southand she found it &quot;mean,&quot; and she does not spare it in her descriptions of NewOrleans. Smith now has invented a 6-foot-tall woman police officer named SkipLangdon, who has never fit into the high New Orleans society to which she wasborn. Skip Langdon belongs to the category of crime fiction called a policeprocedural. &quot;It was kind of thought men owned the American p.i. and womenowned the British cozies. Of course women just moved in on the p.i. novel andsome of us are moving in on the police procedural.&quot; Smith now wants to invadethe last bastion and write a thriller.;    But she emphasizes that it's notbecause she is at war with men. In fact, it turns out it's not just the womenbut the whole mystery-writing community that is so nice it would make SamSpade turn to drink, if he hadn't already. Wherever published mystery writersgather, they have been generous with their time and advice to all of the womenwho are now celebrating success. They gather at local chapter meetings of theMystery Writers of America, at MWA's annual national Edgars convention in thespring and at the convention of fans called the Bouchercon held every fall toaward Anthonys. &quot;Mystery writers are awfully nice people,&quot; Smith says. &quot;Thebest part of being a mystery writer is you get to hang out with other mysterywriters.&quot;;    &quot;WE'RE LIKE A SMALL TOWN that's spread across the country. Wesee each other several times a year at Bouchercon, and New York for the Edgars. . . We've got mammoth phone bills . . . &quot; Lia Matera confesses thishappily.;    Matera has a book due this month. On the marker board in herstudy she has outlined the scene she is about to write. &quot;Next,&quot; it says. &quot;One-- McGwinn comes to the door. Two -- hospital where McGwinn works. DiscussKaren's convalescence.&quot; This book will revolve around a character who tries tocommit suicide with an ice pick and whose husband every day leaves a loadedgun on the table. If she succeeds in killing herself, is there any way underthe law to charge the husband with murder? The question of fairness versus thelaw intrigues Matera, who is a lawyer.;    Six weeks before the book is due,she confesses she has written only 35 pages. &quot;They're 35 good pages,&quot; shesays, and laughs. &quot;This has been a good year for me.&quot; The paperback rights toher latest book, The Good Fight, sold for $105,000. She got an advance on twomore books that's twice as much as her last one. Her entire back list has soldand will be reissued. On her wall hangs the Edgar nomination for A RadicalDeparture and an Anthony nomination for Where Lawyers Fear to Tread. The planetickets on her table are from her publisher, sending her widely on a bookpromotion tour for the first time. And to think she might have had to practicelaw for a living instead.;    A 1978 graduate of UC-Santa Cruz, where sherented a typewriter and wrote her first novel (&quot;it was rejected twice and Iput it away forever&quot;), Matera turned to mystery writing after graduating fromHastings Law School and taking a job as teaching fellow at Stanford. &quot;Ifigured I really needed to get something published or I'd have to be alawyer,&quot; she says with the same biting humor she puts in her books. &quot;I thoughtof it as publish or practice.&quot;;    Her smoothly written novels, taking anequally cynical look at lawyers and at the hypocrisies of some socialactivists of the '60s, have led her to the verge of becoming the next localwoman mystery writer to break out nationally.;    Matera is not above wieldingher fiction as a personal weapon. Just after graduating from Hastings, sheeagerly killed off so many law professors and students in the first draft ofWhere Lawyers Fear to Tread that she says she had to &quot;unmurder&quot; them in therevisions. In one of her books, there is a not very likable Santa Cruzlitigator who doesn't seem to care much whether his wife divorces him.Matera's former husband is a Santa Cruz litigator. There is also a warm butultimately sinister Italian mother who turns her back on a daughter-in-law forhaving an affair. Matera's parents are Italian immigrants who brought her upin Eureka and barely read English. When one of her books was finallytranslated into Italian, Matera says, she was afraid to go home. &quot;But the factthat my heroine smoked pot and had herpes and used bad language was just minorcompared to the operatic tizzy my mother was in over my divorce.&quot;;    But ifthey serve as personal vehicles for talking back, the mysteries women writeserve the readers as well. Matera's sister-in-law is an accountant who lovesV.I. Warshawski. &quot;She loves it that V.I. slaps around a minor bureaucrat toget information,&quot; Matera says, and laughs and shrugs an apology for hersister-in-law's taste at the same time. &quot;Women were ready for a more activevoice. Men were ready for good writing.&quot;;    And it seems to me that themystery, which once was the ultimate male fantasy -- the invincible loner whoneeds no boss and no woman to tie him down -- is easily turning into themodern female fantasy. And what's that? I think it's freedom from physicalvulnerability. In the books this is represented by Sharon McCone easilydeflecting come-ons in a seedy bar; V.I. Warshawski braving a burned-outtenement and talking back to cops; Skip Langdon on duty alone in adrug-infested neighborhood. But for the women who read them, it might just aswell be the simple liberty of walking unaccompanied down a darkened street orout the front door alone in broad daylight -- without being afraid. To be ableto take care of yourself. It's the freedom for Nancy Drew to grow up.;   Which leaves only one small mystery. Are there really bodies buried under LiaMatera's lawn?  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SUSAN COHEN  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910721  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  4,914  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 21, 199100203018,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
