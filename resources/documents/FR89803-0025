Box 231,Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition6E3403 to EPA on behalf of Dr. Robert H. Kupelian, National Director, IR-4Project, and the Agricultural Experiment Stations of California, Florida,New Jersey, Maryland, and Washington.This petition requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e)of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose the establishmentof a tolerance for the combined residues of the nematicide fenamiphos ethyl3-methyl-4-(methylthio)phenyl (1-methylethyl) phosphoramidate and its cholinesteraseinhibiting metabolites ethyl 3-methyl-4-(methylsulfinyl)phenyl (1-methylethyl)phosphoramidate and ethyl 3-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl (1-methylethyl)phosphoramidate in or on the raw agricultural commodity strawberries at0.6 part per million (ppm). The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for whichthe tolerance is sought. The toxicological data considered in support ofthe proposed tolerance include: 1. A 2-year dog feeding study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) forcholinesterase inhibition (ChE) at 1 ppm (equivalent to 0.025 milligram(mg)/kilogram (kg)/day) and no systemic effects at 10 ppm (the highestdose tested). 2. A 2-year feeding/oncogenicity study in rats with a NOEL for cholinesteraseinhibition at less than 2.0 ppm (equivalent to 0.1 mg/kg/day) and no systemiceffects at 10 ppm (equivalent to 0.5 mg/kg/day). The study was negativefor oncogenic effects under the conditions of the study at all feedinglevels. 3. An 18-month oncogenicity study in mice with feeding levels of 2, 10,and 50 ppm (equivalent to 0.3, 1.5, and 7.5 mg/kg/day) which was negativefor oncogenic effects under the conditions of the study at all levels tested.4. A three-generation reproduction study with no reproductive effects at30 ppm (highest dose tested). 5. A teratology study in rabbits with developmental and maternal NOEL'sat 0.5 mg/kg. 6. A neurotoxicity study in hens with no neurotoxicity damage at 12.5 mg/kg(highest dose tested). 7. In a metabolism study in rats, fenamiphos was metabolized to its sulfoxideand sulfone analogs with 50 percent excreted in the urine within 12 to15 hours.8. Genotoxicity studies including an Ames test (negative), a dominant-lethaltest in mice (negative), an <T3>in vitro </T3>assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells (negative for non-activationassay at concentrations up to 130 micrograms/milliliter and for activationassay up to 230 micrograms/milliliter), and gene mutation using <T3>Bacillus subtilis </T3>(negative). Data currently lacking include a teratology study in a second species.Data requirements for registration of fenamiphos are identified in a RegistrationStandard for the chemical, which was issued in June of 1987. The acceptable daily intake (ADI), based on the 2-year feeding study indogs with a NOEL for cholinesterase inhibition at 1.0 ppm (0.025 mg/kg/day)and using a 100-fold safety factor, is calculated to be 0.00025 mg/kg ofbody weight (bw)/day. The anticipated residue contribution (ARC) from existingtolerances is calculated to be 0.000094 mg/kg bw/day, which is equivalentto 37.8 percent of the ADI. The current action will contribute an additional0.000021 mg/kg bw/day of residues to the human diet. The nature of the residues is adequately understood and an adequate analyticalmethod, gas chromatography using a thermionic detector, is available inthe Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II), for enforcement purposes.There are currently no actions pending against the continued registrationof this chemical. Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the toleranceestablished by amending 40 CFR 180.349 would protect the public health.No secondary residues in meat, milk, poultry, or livestock are expectedsince strawberries are not considered a livestock feed commodity. Therefore,it is proposed that the tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registrationof a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein,may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that this rulemaking proposal be referred toan Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document controlnumber [PP 6E3403/P483]. All written comments filed in response to thesepetitions will be available in the Public Information Branch, at the addressgiven above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legalholidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C.601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishingnew tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions fromtolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. A certification statement to this effect waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 20, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Anne E.
