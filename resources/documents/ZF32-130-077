(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Unisys Corp., Blue Bell, Pa., like many other computer manufacturers, hasdeveloped a broad framework designed to allow its proprietary and Unix-basedcomputers to manage a multivendor environment.andM;The Unisys Architecture, like Systems Application Architecture (SAA) from IBMand Network Application Support (NAS) from Digital Equipment Corp., is aimedat allowing the applications and systems software to run across and managemultiple operating systems.andM;In addition to the systems and network management functions, the UnisysArchitecture incorporates systems connectivity, distributed systems,information management and applications information services.andM;While the Unisys Architecture was unveiled early this year, the company in1988 moved to aid in establishing international network management standardsby cofounding with eight other vendors the OSI/Network Management Forum(OSI/NMF).andM;Unisys said its work to provide OSI compliance as a key to Unisys'Architecture will be an advantage in furnishing systems management solutions.andM;&quot;Functionally, we're obviously trying to provide the same thing as IBM andDEC,&quot; said Joseph Arrington, program manager for the information networkgroup.andP;  &quot;We want to provide change management, operations and applicationsmanagement, performance management, problem management, and businessmanagement and security management.andM;&quot;I think that we have a large edge because andlsqb;the Unisys Architectureandrsqb; is anopen OSI platform,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I dare say that over time we will see othersgoing in that direction, but I think we have a leg up, and we expect to keepit.&quot;andM;MORE THAN A BLUEPRINTandM;Arrington added that the Unisys Architecture &quot;is not only a blueprint, it canalready implement a technology that a customer can use.&quot;andP;  He maintains thatUnisys can now provide products that offer users &quot;what we believe to be coretechnologies for building enterprise technology.&quot;andM;So far, Unisys has introduced a trio of OSI-based network management productsthat are now part of the overall Unisys Architecture.andM;The Single Point of Operation (SPO) package, introduced late last year withthe Base 4 OS/1100 operating system for the 1100/90 and 2200 series of Unisysmainframes, &quot;allows multiple hosts to be run from a single workstation,&quot;Arrington said.andM;Ultimately, he said, SPO will have the capability of monitoring andcontrolling a network of computers from multiple vendors, located both in acentral control room and at remote facilities.andM;Last December, the company unveiled a centralized remote site managementsystem for the Unisys and non-Unisys Ctos-based workstations called CtosInControl.andM;Finally, Arrington said, Unisys plans to unveil by the end of September aCommon Network Management System (CNMS) based on the first release of opensystems network management specifications from the OSI/NMF group.andP;  The CNMSis a key to the effort to create a multivendor network management system runby Unisys hardware and software, Arrington said.andM;The CNMS software, according to Arrington, will implement the SystemsManagement Services defined in the Unisys Architecture.andP;  Those services aredescribed by Unisys as offerings that &quot;enable enterprises to define,implement and enforce operational policies and procedures.&quot;andM;According to the Unisys outline of the architecture, &quot;these procedurescontrol, monitor, and safeguard andlsqb;anandrsqb; organization's information systemsassets.&quot;andM;Initially, Arrington acknowledged, the CNMS offering will run only on Unisys2200 mainframes and the DCP line of front-end processors.andP;  Future releasesincorporating TCP/IP and further OSI features will allow the package tomanage other Unisys and several non-Unisys hardware platforms, he said.andM;The open systems effort, Arrington said, is expected by Unisys to promptadditional third parties to develop systems software that can run on thevarious Unisys machines.andP;  To aid the third parties, &quot;we will publish thespecifications and distribute them to whoever wants it,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We have to have some control andlsqb;of the specificationsandrsqb;,&quot; he said, &quot;but we alsohave to encourage people to support andlsqb;the architectureandrsqb;.&quot;andM;Ultimately, any third-party vendor whose product supports the OSI standardwill run on Unisys mainframes.andP;  In an effort to attract even more independentvendors, Arrington said Unisys will provide tools to develop links to theUnisys Architecture.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
