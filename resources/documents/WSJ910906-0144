The $450 million combination of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.and Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc., executives say,will be able to cut and consolidate and reap the benefits ofbigger, better economies of scale. And it will have astronger management.</LP><TEXT>   But industry analysts and executives are skeptical aboutthe transaction. Both companies, saddled by debt andafflicted by widespread industry price-cutting, have haddisappointing earnings records in the last several years.   Some see the transaction as the most recent attempt byCoca-Cola Co., which owns 49% of Coca-Cola Enterprises and20% of Johnston, to solve problems in its domestic bottlingsystem. Bottling companies buy concentrate from Coke, thenmix it with carbonated water, bottle or can it and distributeit to retailers and other outlets.   Coke is worried about the future of &quot;two weak economicentities&quot; that are its biggest distributors, says Roy Burry,an analyst with Kidder Peabody Inc. Coke says that it ishappy with Coca-Cola Enterprises' performance and that itendorses the merger because it advances its strategy ofstrength through consolidation of bottlers.   But to some, the transaction is the latest reminder ofjust how badly Coca-Cola Enterprises has missed its marksince it went public in a high-profile public offering fiveyears ago. Since then, the bottler has increased its overallvolume and market share, benefiting both itself and Coke.   As for Coca-Cola Enterprises, its earnings have beenvolatile. It now says its earnings will decline at least 36%this year. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,Coca-Cola Enterprises shares were quoted at $14.125, wellbelow the initial offering price of $16.50. Last month, oneanalyst's report called the company's stock in the near term&quot;dead money.&quot;   What went wrong? Executives of Coke and Coca-ColaEnterprises declined to be interviewed. But former Cokebottling executives, competitors and analysts all agree amajor part of Coca-Cola Enterprises' problem has beenindustry price-cutting, much of it, they say, brought on byitself. &quot;There's too much dealing out there, and the bottlingcompanies are suffering,&quot; says Tom Pirko, president ofBevmark Inc., a Los Angeles beverage consultant. &quot;We're goingto need more consolidation just to provide financialstability in this period of relatively flat growth.&quot;   A Coca-Cola Enterprises spokesman said price-cutting isn'tpart of its strategy. &quot;It has always been our intent tojudiciously raise prices and have volume growth and lowercosts,&quot; he said. &quot;We have not become efficient in order todrive prices down.&quot;   But a former company executive says price-cutting alwayswas to be a major component of the company's strategy. Partof the plan was to consolidate many of Coke's smaller,disparate bottlers and cut production costs significantly,the executive said.   Once that had been accomplished, he said, Coca-ColaEnterprises would be able to adjust its own prices lowenough, while still maintaining comfortable profit margins,that competitors such as PepsiCo Inc. wouldn't be able tofollow without seriously eroding profitability.   Coca-Cola Enterprises did do a good job of consolidatingand cutting costs. It bought 34 bottlers for about $3.6billion, and then molded them into its single operation. Itcut its work force by 20% to 20,000 and cut costs by mergingdistribution and raw-materials buying. But it badly misjudgedhow far Pepsi would eventually go to meet its price-cutting,the former executive said. &quot;If the cost advantage everexisted, Pepsi and other bottlers wouldn't allow CCE to buyup market share,&quot; he says. The price wars turned out to bedeeper and more prolonged than CCE had anticipated.   The bottler was also under pressure to keep up its volume,competitors and former executives say. With its earningsrecord so erratic, it was difficult for Coca-Cola Enterprisesto raise prices without suffering the consequences: an almostcertain short-term decline in both volume and earnings. WithCoke looking over its shoulder quarter-by-quarter, it wasespecially difficult for Coca-Cola Enterprises to take thevolume hit, it is widely believed. What makes money for asyrup company -- notably retail discounting to boost volume-- can whittle a bottler's profits.   &quot;CCE is very much caught between their public shareholdersand the desire of Coca-Cola to sell as much syrup as theycan,&quot; says Mr. Burry, the analyst. He believes Coke wouldprevent Coca-Cola Enterprises from doing much that would hurtvolume.   Coke and Coca-Cola Enterprises both deny that Coke hasanything to do with the pricing strategies of its bottlers.&quot;It is a highly complex decision, which we leave to thebottler,&quot; said a Coke spokeswoman.   Coca-Cola Enterprises and the rest of the bottlingindustry have been hurt by a slowing of soft drink marketgrowth. From its peak growth rate of about 4% to 5% in themid 1980s, the soft drink market has settled into a 1% to 2%rate currently. That may be partly Coke and Pepsi's fault, asthey haven't come up with the kind of glitzy new products,like the diet drinks with NutraSweet, decaffeinated drinksand fruit flavored sodas, that stirred up consumer demand inthe early to mid-1980s. Coke's advertising, too, has beengenerally considered lackluster lately.   Coca-Cola Enterprises isn't the only bottler to havesuffered, by any means. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidatedhad a slight profit last year after several years of losses,and analysts believe Pepsi, which doesn't break out resultsfor its company-owned bottlers, hasn't been immune to theprice wars that have eroded profit margins elsewhere.Johnston Coca-Cola has had losses in its past five fiscalyears. A series of acquisitions in recent years has leftJohnston Coca-Cola with about $1 billion in debt.   Under the merger proposal, Johnston and Coca-ColaEnterprises combined would control about 55% of all Coke'sbottle and can sales domestically. The plan also calls for achange in top management that, apparently, caught executivesof Coca-Cola Enterprises by surprise. The bottler's chiefexecutive, Brian G. Dyson, a former Coke top gun who had beenchosen to run Coca-Cola Enterprises, will be moved aside. Andlast week, James M. Stevens, Coca-Cola Enterprises' chiefoperating officer since April 1989, resigned. His job is tobe filled by a Johnston executive under the proposal. TheCoca-Cola Enterprises spokesman said he left to &quot;pursue otherinterests,&quot; and the departure was unrelated to the mergerproposal. Plans are to make Mr. Dyson one of two vicechairman of the merged company.   The combination of the bottling companies could, indeed,help Coca-Cola Enterprises, analysts say. For one thing,Henry A. Schimberg, Johnston's president and chief operatingofficer, is widely regarded as one of the top bottlingexecutives in the country. He has been an innovator in thebasics of the bottling business, developing improveddistribution methods. Under the merger, he would becomepresident and chief operating officer of Coca-ColaEnterprises.   Moreover, Johnston has developed some state-of-the-artprocessing techniques; it has one plant in Cincinnati, forexample, that is the industry's first fully automatedwarehouse, replacing forklifts with automatically guidedvehicles, thus reducing labor costs. Johnston's territories,primarily in the Midwest, would fit nicely with some ofEnterprises' adjoining areas.   And while some securities analysts are optimistic aboutthe combined bottlers' chance for success, some are guardedabout how effective the organization can be in changing whatreally matters: price. &quot;Breaking out of price promoting isone of the most difficult things to do,&quot; says Michael Bellas,president of Beverage Marketing Corp., a New York consultant.&quot;You can't collude, but you have to maintain your volume.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
