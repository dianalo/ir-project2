The maker of solar water heaters and distillers said its creditors filed proceedings in October to place it into Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which usually forces a company to liquidate. However, Equinox said it succeeded this week in transferring the proceedings to Chapter 11, under which a company is protected from creditors while it tries to work out a plan to pay debts.    The company said it has assets of about $1.2 million and liabilities of about $950,000. In 1987, Equinox said, it had a net loss of $1.7 million on sales of $151,115.    Equinox also said its chairman, George Friedlander, resigned in November. Hamid R. Momayez-Zadeh, 32 years old, who was president and chief executive officer until he quit last June because of a dispute with Mr. Friedlander, becomes chairman and chief executive.    Neither the management shake-up nor the October action of creditors was announced until now. Mr. Zadeh said that the company didn't report the moves because it was involved in talks with prospective investors and that in the fight to transfer bankruptcy proceedings it would have been &quot;frivolous for us to say anything until that was settled.&quot;    Mr. Zadeh said the company has sued Mr. Friedlander for breach of fiduciary duty and also is disputing the bankruptcy court claim of its major creditors, closely held Cambridge Lee Industries Inc., Boston.    Mr. Friedlander couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
