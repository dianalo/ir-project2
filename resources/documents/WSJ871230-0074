Commonwealth Electric Co., a unit of Cambridge, Mass.-based Commonwealth Energy System, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate Boston Edison's management of its temporarily shut-down Pilgrim nuclear power plant. Commonwealth asserted that Boston Edison &quot;has not fulfilled its obligations to manage the Pilgrim plant prudently and diligently during its current and prior outages.&quot;    Under a contract with Boston Edison, Commonwealth, which buys power produced by the Pilgrim plant, is required to pay $1.8 million a month to Boston Edison regardless of whether the plant is operating. In addition to its FERC request, Commonwealth sued Boston Edison in federal court in Boston requesting that Commonwealth not be required to make the monthly payments while the plant is idled.    Boston Edison said it may respond with a suit against Commonwealth, but declined to elaborate.    Separately, Commonwealth asked the FERC to order Boston Edison to pay $60 million in damages to Commonwealth for failing to repair the plant, which has been shut down since April 1986.    Since Pilgrim's shutdown, Commonwealth has purchased replacement power from a New England power group at a cost of about $1.2 million a month, a company spokesman said. Noting that the 20-month shutdown has cost Commonwealth about $60 million, the utility asked the FERC to terminate or alter its contract with Boston Edison so that it won't have to pay for services it doesn't receive, the spokesman said.    &quot;We regret having to take this very serious action,&quot; Jeremiah Donovan, Commonwealth Electric's president and chief operating officer, said. &quot;The magnitude of this problem leaves us no choice but to file this petition and is, in fact, a last resort after having failed to arrange a reasonable alternative with Boston Edison Co.&quot;    Sharon Hyland, a FERC spokeswoman, said that complaints filed by one utility against another are rare.    Two other utilities receive power from Pilgrim: Eastern Utilities Associates and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Cos. An Eastern spokesman said that it agreed yesterday with Boston Edison temporarily not to take legal action against Boston Edison regarding the Pilgrim plant. However, if Commonwealth's requests regarding the plant are granted, Eastern may seek similar compensation or changes in its contract with Boston Edison, the spokesman said.    Officials with Massachusetts Municipal couldn't be reached for comment.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boston Edison shares closed at $18.875, unchanged.    As previously reported, state regulators last year issued an unusually harsh criticism of Boston Edison's managers, charging that they were remiss in their duty to plan for the future. Earlier this year, a report commissioned by directors of Boston Edison faulted the utility for &quot;its excessive adversarial stance against&quot; regulators and for its insufficient support for energy conservation.    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ranks Pilgrim as one of the worst-managed nuclear plants in the country. </TEXT></DOC>
