SeibStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTEXECUTIVE (EXE)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   While the U.S. agonizes over the Reagan administration's plan to give military protection to Kuwaiti tankers, Iran's &quot;Defenders of the Persian Gulf&quot; are preparing for action.    Fifty battalions of the Defenders -- 20,000 irregulars -- marched noisily through the streets of Tehran and headed off to the gulf about a week ago, Tehran Radio reported. Ali Reza Afshar, a spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guards, claimed without elaboration that his men are turning islands in the gulf into &quot;huge battleships that can easily hunt all of the enemy's ships and naval apparatus.&quot;    Though the Iranian drum-beating has gone almost unnoticed here, it illustrates how rapidly the U.S. and Iran are letting their rhetoric push them toward a confrontation that isn't in the long-term interest of either side. Few experts think Iran will launch a frontal attack on U.S. ships in the gulf. But Iran's recent war history suggests that after it threatens and blusters, it usually acts - albeit often indirectly, or incompetently, or counter to its own best interests. Iran often feels compelled to do something -- even if only to save face.    As a result, American intelligence experts are worried about Iranian-inspired terrorist or commando attacks against U.S. targets. If an attack occurs, the most important -- and most difficult -- task for the Reagan administration and Congress will be to avoid overreacting. An all-out fight probably isn't what Iran wants and could be a strategic disaster for the U.S.    American intelligence analysts believe Iran may be tempted to launch unconventional attacks that can't be traced clearly to Tehran, yet still get across the message that Iran isn't taking an expanded U.S. presence lying down.    Thus, American officials worry, Iran may float more mines into the path of U.S. ships in the gulf. Some U.S.-related installations could become terrorism targets: the port in Bahrain, where the command ship of the U.S. Persian Gulf task force docks; the Arabian-American Oil Co. in Saudi Arabia; and U.S. embassies in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. In addition, intelligence analysts think there is danger of more hostage-taking and airline hijackings.    These concerns arise in part because Iran's posture has stiffened. Its reaction was surprisingly low-key when Washington announced plans to put U.S. flags on Kuwaiti tankers and guard them against Iranian attack.    That changed, in the view of American analysts, when an Iraqi missile struck the USS Stark in the gulf this spring. The Stark incident focused attention on the gulf and on the U.S. agreement to escort Kuwaiti tankers. That attention made it impossible for Tehran to ignore what it saw as a challenge in its own back yard, U.S. officials believe.    So Iran has grown more belligerent. Tehran radio has said that the first Defenders of the Persian Gulf battalions would be in place by this past weekend. As they began heading off, Iranian chief justice Ayatollah Abdulkarim Musavi Ardebili warned: &quot;If Reagan doesn't use his brain and enters this dangerous abyss, he should know that our youth will defend their honor and humanity with all their might.&quot;    Such talk hardly means Iran wants to go toe-to-toe with the U.S. Indeed, Iranian parliament speaker Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has called chances for a confrontation with the U.S. &quot;small,&quot; and Iran's posturing may be defensive.    Gary Sick, who handled Iranian affairs in the Carter White House, argues that &quot;the Iranians, for all their incendiary rhetoric, have in fact avoided a direct military confrontation with the U.S. They've got a war on their hands {with Iraq}. They don't want another one.&quot;    But Iranian war bluster has often led to action, even if the action was less than the bluster suggested. For instance, Iran followed up its threat to strike deep into Iraq in retaliation for raids on Iranian cities by firing missiles into Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. Iran recently warned Kuwait against hosting an Islamic summit at which Iran was to be criticized -- and soon, mysterious explosions hit Kuwaiti oil installations.    So it won't be surprising if an isolated U.S. target is hit. But it is worth remembering that such an attack may spring more from an Iranian desire to save face than from an itch to take on America.    Both history and geopolitics suggest that over time Iran will be drawn toward the U.S. and away from the Soviet Union. Yet if American leaders don't show restraint, they could drive this strategically important country even further away and invite precisely what President Reagan wants to prevent -- an expanded Soviet role in the gulf. </TEXT></DOC>
