This NPRM proposedto require operators of pipeline facilities (including LNG facilities butexcluding master meter systems) used for the transportation of naturalgas or hazardous liquids to have an anti-drug program for employees whoperform sensitive safety- and security-related functions. The NPRM invitedcomments from the public on these proposed rules and 73 written commentswere received by the end of the comment period on September 6, 1988. Thesecomments are in the public docket and have been reviewed in the developmentof the final rule.The RSPA held public hearings on these proposed regulations on August 17,1988, in Irving, Texas, and on September 6, 1988, in Washington, DC. Twenty-sixpersons testified at these hearings and the testimony was recorded by acourt reporter. The transcripts of the hearings and any statements or othermaterial submitted at the hearings are in the public docket and have beenreviewed in the development of the final rule. The NPRM proposed that this regulation would be included in Part 192, 193,or 195, as appropriate. In response to a few commenters who suggested thatdrug testing regulations should not be included with those commodity-specificregulations, the RSPA has adopted a new Part 199 specifically for theseregulations. <T3>Drug Testing Program Guidelines. </T3>In the NPRM for this rule, RSPAproposed that all drug testing take place in accordance with the ``MandatoryGuidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs'' of the Department of Healthand Human Services (DHHS) (53 FR 11970; April 11, 1988). These guidelinesdescribe the collection and testing procedures applicable to all drug testingin the federal government, and they include safeguards for the accuracyand privacy of testing. The DOT has determined that certain modifications of the DHHS Guidelinesare appropriate in the context of this and other DOT operating administrationdrug-free workplace regulations. The result is the DOT <T3>Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs. </T3>These``DOT Procedures'' are intended to preserve, to the greatest extent practicable,the important safeguards provided by the DHHS Guidelines. The Office of the Secretary of the Department of Transportation is publishingelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>an Interim Final Rule and request for commentsentitled, <T3>Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs. </T3>TheseProcedures, which will be codified in 49 CFR Part 40, are based on Departmentof Health and Human Services Guidelines for Drug Testing, with appropriatemodifications to allow them to apply to private industry and state andlocal governments. The new 49 CFR Part 40 provides detailed informationfor implementation of the drug testing requirements of this rule, settingforth requirements for such things as specimen collection procedures, laboratoryprocedures, and quality assurance. Some of the modifications to the DHHS Guidelines are editorial in nature(for example, references to responsibilities of ``agencies'' are changedto references to ``employers''). Other modifications are intended to takeinto account differences in the situations of federal agencies and DOTregulated industries. For example, in testing at remote sites, DOT regulatedindustries may find it necessary to conduct some kinds of testing in medicalfacilities or through use of mobile units, rather than the more permanentcollection sites contemplated by the DHHS Guidelines. It may not be practicablefor regulated parties to maintain on-site permanent log books. Consequently,the DOT Procedures permit alternative collection and recordkeeping proceduresin these circumstances. During the comment period on the NPRM and anti-drug rules proposed by otheroperating administrations, comments were received concerning the DHHS Guidelines.These comments will be incorporated in the docket for the OST interim finalrule creating 49 CFR Part 40. The OST will respond to those comments, aswell as comments received during the comment period for Part 40, in itsnotice following the end of the comment period on the interim rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>The RSPA received 73 timely comments in response to the NPRM, includingfive comments from labor unions, five from state and federal governmentagencies, eight from pipeline industry associations, a few comments fromindividuals and others, and the remainder from pipeline operators. Themajority of the commenters were opposed to one or more aspects of the proposedrule, while some commenters generally supported the proposed rule. TheRSPA considered all timely-filed comments submitted in response to theNPRM as well as the testimony of the 26 individuals who presented statementsat the two public hearings. Discussion of the comments received on majorissues and RSPA's response follows. Specific Issues <T3> Constitutionality of Mandatory Drug Testing</T3>. Many commenters,raising issues related to the Fourth Amendment and right of privacy, questionthe constitutionality of drug testing programs for pipeline personnel.The majority of commenters who raised the constitutional issues questionedthe wisdom of proceeding with a drug rule while cases involving constitutionalityof drug testing are pending in the Supreme Court. The commenters specificallynoted that, in<T3> Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Burnley</T3>, the Ninth Circuithas ruled that a mandatory drug testing program of railroad employees violatedthe Fourth Amendment because the program required testing of entire operationcrews involved in accidents without requiring the existence of a reasonableand particularized suspicion of drug use or drug-related impairment onthe part of those to be tested. The Fifth Circuit took a contrary viewin<T3> National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab</T3> by holding thatdrug testing of Customs Service employees seeking transfer to certain sensitivepositions is permissible. Both cases are now pending before the UnitedStates Supreme Court. Commenters also point to the recent case of<T3> Mark B. Harmon v. Edwin Meese III</T3>. (No. 88-1766 GHR, U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia, decided July 29, 1988). In that case,the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted theplaintiffs, Department of Justice employees, a preliminary injunction toenjoin the Department from implementing mandatory random drug testing ongrounds that the program constituted an unreasonable search and seizure.The Court subsequently made the injunction permanent. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. The RSPA recognizes that there are legitimate andsignificant constitutional concerns surrounding drug testing in generaland random drug testing as a specific component of drug testing. The RSPAacknowledges the current wide-scale litigation and apparent disparate judicialopinions on drug testing programs. Although the state of the case law isstill evolving in rapid fashion and the Supreme Court has not resolvedmany of the relevant and complex issues, the RSPA is confident that testingof employees under this rule will withstand judicial scrutiny on constitutionalgrounds. Of particular concern to the commenters was the relevance of the FourthAmendment to drug testing. The principles of the Fourth Amendment to theU.S. Constitution are paramount in scrutinizing the fundamental legalityof many drug testing programs. The Fourth Amendment applies to ``searches''conducted or mandated by the government (i.e., ``state action'') and protectsindividuals against ``unreasonable searches and seizures.'' Action by aprivate party does not constitute state or federal action unless thereexists a close nexus between the state and the action in question.<T3> See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison</T3>, 419 U.S. 345 (1974);<T3> Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis</T3>, 407 U.S. 163 (1972). Because drug testing programs required under the final rule are imposedby the government, two collateral issues arise concerning whether the proposedurine tests under these programs constitute a search or a seizure and,if so, is the search or seizure unreasonable within the meaning of theFourth Amendment. Although most courts to address the issue to date haveruled that toxicological testing of employees for the purpose of determiningfitness for duty is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,the issue is not entirely settled.<T3> See Wyman v. James</T3>, 400 U.S. 309, 317-338 (1971) (governmentwelfare caseworker's ``home visit'' as a precondition for assistance paymentsis not a Fourth Amendment search).<T3> See also, Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga</T3>, 846 F.2d 1539, 1553-54(6th Cir. 1988) (Guy, J., dissenting)<T3> vacated and rehearing en banc granted</T3> (6th Cir. Aug. 3, 1988);<T3> National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab</T3>, 808 F.2d 1057,1060, 1062 (5th Cir. 1987) (Higginbotham, J., concurring).<T3> Cf. Mack v. United States, F.B.I.</T3>, 814 F.2d 120, 125 n.2 (2ndCir. 1987). Also assuming,<T3> arguendo</T3>, that urine tests of personnel for prohibited substancesare ``searches'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, it is clearthat while searches ordinarily must be conducted pursuant to a warrantissued on probable cause grounds, such a requirement is not always necessary.<T3> Almeida-Sanchez v. United States</T3>, 413 U.S. 266, 277 (1973) (Powell,J., concurring). Where, for example, ``* * * the burden of obtaining awarrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search* * *,'' the Supreme Court has routinely held that a warrant is not requiredby the Fourth Amendment (citing<T3> Camera v. Municipal Court</T3>, 387 U.S. 523, 533 (1967).<T3> See e.g., Griffin v. Wisconsin</T3>, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3167 (1987) (pluralityopinion);<T3> New Jersey v. T.L.O.</T3>, 469 U.S. 325, 340 (1985). The Supreme Courthas likewise found that the probable cause standard is inappropriate whereit would defeat the purpose that the search is designed to achieve.<T3> See e.g., New Jersey v. T.L.O.</T3>, 469 U.S. at 340-342;<T3> United States v. Martinez-Fuerte</T3>, 428 U.S. 543, 560-561 (1976)(footnotes omitted) (while ``* * * some quantum of individualized suspicionis usually a prerequisite to constitutional search or seizure[,] * * *the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion'').Rather, ``[t]he fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searchesand seizures be reasonable * * *.''<T3> New Jersey v. T.L.O.</T3>, 469 U.S. at 340. In determining the reasonablenessof a search, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed the importance ofthe facts particular to the search while acknowledging that the test ofreasonableness ``* * * is not capable of precise definition or mechanicalapplication.''<T3> Bell v. Wolfish</T3>, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). In analyzing a drugtesting program, ``* * * what is reasonable depends on the context withinwhich a search takes place.''<T3> New Jersey v. T.L.O.</T3>, 469 U.S. at 337. In scrutinizing whether a particular search comports with the Fourth Amendment,courts have adopted a balancing test. In general, to support a claim thata search of an individual or the individual's property is reasonable, thegovernment must demonstrate that, on balance, the public's legitimate interestin conducting the search outweighs the individual's legitimate expectationor privacy.<T3> See e.g., United States v. Montoya de Hernandez</T3>, 473 U.S. 531,537 (1985);<T3> United States v. Villamonte-Marquez</T3>, 462 U.S. 579, 588 (1983);<T3> Delaware v. Prouse</T3>, 440 U.S. 648, 654 (1979). Thus, the courtsmust ``* * * consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the mannerin which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and theplace in which it is conducted.''<T3> Bell v. Wolfish</T3>, 441 U.S. at 559.Viewed in this light, the clear public interest in assuring that certainsensitive safety-related pipeline personnel perform their duties free ofprohibited substances provides justification for testing and its limitedintrusion on privacy expectations of covered employees. The drug problemin society in general and probability of drug use in the pipeline industrywere discussed in the preamble of the NPRM. The impairing effects of drugsand the substantial risks to public safety posed by sensitive safety-relatedpipeline personnel who use drugs underlies the compelling governmentalinterest in the promulgation of this rule. It is important to note that the drug testing requirements of the finalrule are limited in scope and involve a minimal intrusion on privacy. Asthe Supreme Court has indicated, where searches are undertaken in situationswhere individualized suspicion is lacking, other safeguards must be reliedupon to ensure that the discretion of the party conducting the search isproperly defined and the scope of the search is limited. <T3>See Delaware v. Prouse, </T3>440 U.S. at 654-655 (footnote omitted);<T3>New York v. Burger, </T3>107 S.Ct. 2636 (1987). The drug testing requirementsof the final rule place significant constraints on an operator's discretionin conducting drug testing. For example, the requirement for random drugtesting calls for selection of an employee to be tested in a scientifically-acceptablemanner, such as by use of a computer-based random number generator. Requirementsfor testing based on reasonable cause or post-accident testing also areseverely circumscribed in order to limit an employer's discretion in administeringthese tests to employees. The actual testing procedures that each employer is required to implementunder this final rule are narrowly tailored to respect an employee's reasonableexpectations of privacy. The DOT Procedures governing collection of urinesamples are carefully designed to preserve privacy while protecting theintegrity of the sample. The final rule contains a number of importantemployee safeguards, including privacy during collection under most typesof tests, stringent laboratory safeguards, and provisions for challengingthe test results. Other employee drug testing programs incorporating thecollection and testing procedures of the DHHS Guidelines have been upheldagainst constitutional challenge. <T3>See American Federation of Government Employees v. Dole, </T3>670 F.Supp.445 (D.D.C. 1987), <T3>appeal filed, </T3>No. 87-5417 (D.C.Cir. Dec. 11, 1987) (upholdingthe constitutionality of the Department of Transportation program for randomdrug testing of safety-sensitive agency employees); <T3>National Association of Air Traffic Specialists v. Dole, </T3>2 Ind.Emp.Rts.Cases (BNA) 68 (D.Alaska 1987) (denying a motion for a preliminary injunctionagainst the FAA's use of urinalysis drug testing as part of an annual physicalexamination of the agency's air traffic specialists). Equally significant is the fact that urine drug testing of sensitive safety-relatedemployees is to be conducted in the ``context'' of the employment relationship.As the Supreme Court has noted, ``[t]he operational realities of the workplace* * * may make <T3>some </T3>employees' expectation of privacy unreasonable.'' <T3>O'Connor v. Ortega, </T3>107 S.Ct. 1492 (1987) (emphasis in original).This is particularly important in circumstances where the employee worksin an industry in which an employee's activities are subject to extensiveregulation. Thus, persons who work in such ``closely regulated'' industrieshave a ``reduced expectation of privacy'' [<T3>New York v. Burger, </T3>107 S.Ct. 2636 (1987)] and, ``in effect consent[]to the restrictions placed upon them'' [<T3>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </T3>413 U.S. at 271]. For thesereasons, two federal courts of appeals have upheld urinalysis testing,in the absence of particularized suspicion, in industries where pervasiveregulation has reduced an employee's expectation of privacy. <T3>See Rushton v. Nebraska Public Power Dist., </T3>844 F.2d 562, 566(8th Cir. 1988) (nuclear plant operators); <T3>Shoemaker v. Handel, </T3>795 F.2d 1136, 1142 (3rd Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>479 U.S. 986 (1986) (jockeys); <T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n, Local 318 v. Township of Washington,</T3>850 F.2d 133 (3rd Cir. 1988) (police officers). The RSPA recognizes that a number of federal and state courts have rejectedgovernment-mandated drug testing programs on Fourth Amendment grounds.However, even courts striking drug testing programs have recognized thatdrug testing is appropriate in other contexts. <T3>See e.g., Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga, </T3>846 F.2d 1539, 1553-54(6th Cir. 1988) (Martin, J.), <T3>vacated and rehearing en banc granted </T3>(6th Cir., August 3, 1988)(``When determining, then whether a mandatory drug search is `reasonable,'we believe that, as the costs to society of an impaired employee increase,the requisite level of suspicion that a drug problem exists decreases.'');<T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n, Local 318 v. Township of Washington,</T3>672 F.Supp. 779, 792 (D.N.J. 1987), rev'd 850 F.2d 133 (3rd Cir.,1988) ([T]he need to prevent a major airline disaster presents a far morecompelling rationale than those presented [by the municipality in supportof testing its police officers.]''); <T3>American Federation of Government Employees v. Meese, </T3>No. C-88-1419-SAW(N.D.Cal. June 17, 1988) (issuing a preliminary injunction against a Bureauof Prison plan to test randomly all agency employees but nonetheless notingthat ``[t]here are cases in which compulsory drug testing may be justifiedin the interest of public safety or security.'' Memorandum opinion at 2).The RSPA also is aware of the recent Ninth Circuit decision that held thatthe Federal Railroad Administration's mandatory blood and urine tests aftercertain accidents, incidents, or rule violations are unconstitutional becausethe rules do not require a showing of ``particularized suspicion'' of drugor alcohol impairment prior to testing. <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Burnley, </T3>839 F.2d 575(9th Cir. 1988), <T3>cert. granted, </T3>108 S.Ct. 2033 (1988). The Supreme Court has granteda government petition for <T3>writ of certiorari </T3>in this case and has ordered that the casebe argued this term ``in tandem'' with <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab, </T3>816 F.2d 170 (5thCir. 1987), <T3>cert. granted, </T3>108 S.Ct. 1072 (1988) (upholding drug testing ofapplicants for critical safety or security sensitive positions in the U.S.Customs Service). Decisions in these cases may not be forthcoming untilthe Spring of 1989. Numerous commenters urge that RSPA should delay a decisionon a final drug rule until these cases are resolved. The RSPA disagrees.Although currently not resolved, the RSPA believes that RSPA's anti-drugprogram and similar drug testing regimens proposed by other administrationswithin the Department will be ruled constitutional. The critical publicsafety need for properly administered drug testing to ensure that employeesin the transportation industry are free from drugs while performing certainsensitive safety-related functions outweighs the practical considerationswhich would delay rulemaking so that it could be tailored to any guidancethat may be offered by the Supreme Court when the pending cases are ultimatelydecided. Such a decision would unnecessarily delay the adoption of thisimportant safety rule well beyond that needed to allow reasonable timefor implementation. Furthermore, partly in response to the comments thaturge delay pending the Supreme Court decisions, RSPA has adjusted the implementationdates provided in this rule. This delayed implementation of the rule willensure that it can be implemented as soon as practical and will allow timeto amend the rule in the unlikely event the Supreme Court provides guidancethat makes that necessary or appropriate. <T3>Need for Pipeline Anti-Drug Program. </T3>Many commenters who opposedrug testing in general, and random testing in particular, and even commenterswho support the comprehensive drug testing proposals, expressed the beliefthat there is not sufficient evidence of a drug problem in the pipelineindustry to warrant mandated drug testing requirements. Many commentersindicated that the proposed rule did not discuss or recognize the exemplarysafety record in the pipeline industry. They also said that neither thepipeline industry nor the RSPA could show any pipeline accident that couldbe attributable to an employee that had been impaired due to the use ofdrugs. Many commenters further note that most pipeline accidents are causedby third party excavators over which the pipeline operators have littlecontrol.  The American Gas Association (AGA) also pointed out that pipelines areunique forms of transportation which do not carry people, unlike otherforms of transportation regulated by DOT. Therefore, there are no passengersthat depend upon the physical condition of the pipeline for their safety.Pipeline employees usually work in groups or teams, which make it lesslikely for an impaired worker to endanger the public. The AGA further arguedthat pipelines also have built-in safety features that would preclude adrug-impaired employee from causing an accident.  Comments from the Ohio Gas Association state that the presence of drugsin a person is an inadequate gauge of a person's present impairment anda person's performance on complex tasks does not necessarily suffer whenunder the influence of drugs. That Association cites one study that examinedhow well 12 daily users of an opiate could perform complex tasks. The resultsshowed that the regular drug users performed as well as a nonuser controlgroup.  The American Petroleum Institute (API) said it believed that any regulatoryrequirement, regardless of its worthwhile intentions, must demonstrateboth a need and a solution that bears a positive relationship between costsand benefits. The API further asserts that a thorough assessment resultingin a demonstrated and compelling need must precede any broad and costlyregulatory remedy for such a problem and they recommend that DOT undertakesuch a study.  The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) representing 10,000 membersemployed in the gas industry, primarily in gas distribution, is opposedto random and universal drug testing stating that the presence of drugsin a person's system does not indicate impairment on the job. The SEIUsays that often tests detect the use of drugs in the past or during off-dutyhours, and they object to the control of a worker's actions beyond thetime the employee is at work.  On these bases, the commenters assert that the RSPA cannot justify thecomprehensive proposals contained in the NPRM. Many of these commentersmaintain that the industry should police itself in the area of drug useand abuse.  <T3>RSPA Response. </T3>RSPA does recognize the excellent safety recordof the hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline industry. However, asstated in the NPRM, RSPA also has in the record evidence of a serious drugproblem in our society generally. In fact, one in five Americans used drugsin the last year and one in ten in the last month. RSPA also believes thatthis societal problem may extend into the pipeline workplace. While manycommenters do not believe there is a problem in their industry, no commenterpresented any statistically reliable data to prove there is not a drugproblem similar to the societal problems. In fact, the reason that neitherRSPA nor the commenters have such data is because very little testing hasbeen done.  On the other hand, the large majority of commenters, even those opposingthe rule, agree that a drug-impaired employee should not be performinga safety-related function on a pipeline. In fact, the majority of pipelinecompanies commenting on the rule stated that they had implemented anti-drugprograms which generally included pre-employment, post-accident, and reasonablecause testing. The RSPA believes that the safety positions on a pipelineshould not be performed by those impaired by drugs and that this rulemakingaction to deter drug use is warranted and will promote safety.  The RSPA does not adopt safety regulations only after an ``accident'' occurs.A safety regulatory agency must anticipate potential problems and act ina rational, reasonable, and practicable way to prevent ``accidents'' fromoccurring.  Although pipelines do not transport passengers, this is not a criticaldeterminant in deciding whether an anti-drug abuse rule is needed. Many,if not most, of the transportation employees who are or are proposed tobe covered in other of the Department's anti-drug abuse programs are involvedin freight rather than passenger transportation. Drug-using transportationemployees can endanger not just passengers but other members of the publicas well. Pipelines criss-cross the nation with transmission pipeline systemsand there are extensive natural gas distribution systems located in theheart of most populated areas. Release of the hazardous commodities transportedby these pipelines can endanger both pipeline employees and any memberof the public who may happen to live, work, attend school near, or simplypass by the pipeline. Risk is even greater for people living near LNG storagefacilities where the sudden release of a large volume of LNG can engulfsurrounding areas with a flammable vapor cloud and create the potentialfor conflagration.  The RSPA also rejects claims that the degree of supervision afforded pipelineemployees, the fact that they work in groups, and the existence of numerousbuilt-in safety features on pipelines, renders an anti-drug abuse programunnecessary. In this regard, pipelines are not unlike many other transportationindustries. For example, train operators are heavily supervised and workin teams, operating trains which are frequently equipped with safety devicesthat check the performance of the train operator. Yet in the January 4,1987, Chase, Maryland, train accident, a Conrail movement passed an absoluterestrictive signal and went through a switch into the path of a high-speedAmtrak train. Sixteen persons were killed and 174 were injured. The engineerand conductor of the Conrail train later admitted smoking marijuana inthe cab just prior to the collision. The built-in safety devices had beentampered with.As further example, the nuclear industry is much more extensively supervisedwith substantial built-in safety devices. Anti-drug programs have beenrecognized as appropriate under these conditions because of the grave riskto public safety. <T3>Rushton v. Nebraska Public Power Dist., </T3>cited above. No amountof supervision or peer observation in the pipeline industry will assurethat a drug abusing employee does not report for duty with drug use undetectedand no built-in safety device is truly fail-safe.  Many reports, some referenced in the NPRM, clearly illustrate that theuse of drugs impair employees' performance in the workplace. The effectsof drugs have been documented in numerous studies and the RSPA is not persuadedby the few studies, mentioned by some commenters, that drugs do not affectthe performance of employees and the safety of the workplace.  <T3>Accuracy of Drug Test Results. </T3>A few commenters base their oppositionto drug testing on the perceived inaccuracy of analysis and test results.The commenters include the issues of false-positive test results, passiveinhalation of illicit drugs, and misidentification of licit drugs resultingin a positive drug test result.  The Steelworkers' comments included the testimony of Mr. Lawrence Miikeof the Office of Technology Assessment that he gave on April 9, 1987, beforethe Senate Committee on the Judiciary. That testimony details the pitfallsand costs of extensive drug testing procedures and methodology where thepopulation tested is small.  <T3>RSPA Response: </T3>The RSPA is aware of these expressed concerns becauseeach of these issues surfaced in the early 1980's with the first seriesof drug testing programs introduced in the military and the private sector.In the early years of drug testing and analysis, laboratory security andanalytical procedures had not reached today's level of sophistication.False-positive test results occur primarily during analysis of a specimenduring an initial screening test, although contemporary screening tests,such as immunoassay tests, have become extremely accurate and approach99 percent accuracy levels. Despite its accuracy, the initial screeningtest remains a less expensive test used only to yield a preliminary indicationof the possible presence of drugs or drug metabolites. In order to ensurethe integrity and accuracy of any final test result, each positive initialscreening test result must be confirmed using the gas chromatography/massspectrometry (GC/MS) test as approved by DHHS. The GC/MS confirmation testis an extremely accurate and sophisticated test and is virtually error-freewhen used in compliance with the DOT Procedures.  Operators must comply with the DOT Procedures when conducting a testingprogram pursuant to these rules. The DOT Procedures provide a system ofchecks and balances during collection and analysis of specimens to ensurethe integrity and accuracy of the tests using appropriate scientific methodsand rigid chain-of-custody procedures. An operator may only use a laboratorythat has been certified by DHHS to process and analyze specimens. Sincethe mid-1980's, laboratories have become increasingly sophisticated intheir analytical methods and chain-of-custody procedures. Many laboratorieshave compiled extensive records demonstrating scientific accuracy and protectionof individual specimens.  For example, since 1980, one major drug testing laboratory has analyzedover 500,000 urine samples, conducting discrete testing for nine differentdrugs which resulted in nearly five million distinct analyses of thesespecimens. The company also has analyzed approximately 750,000 urine samplesfor the presence of two different drugs, resulting in nearly 1.5 millionanalyses of these specimens, pursuant to its contract with the military.None of the over six million analyses performed for DOT, the military,and other private and public entities has resulted in a false-positivetest result.  The RSPA does not believe that the issue of ``passive inhalation'' of marijuanasmoke will prove to be a significant issue leading to false-positive testresults. First, the threshold levels at which a drug test would yield apositive result for the presence of marijuana or marijuana metabolitesare set at a level sufficiently high to preclude the possibility that suchresult was based on passive inhalation of marijuana smoke. Second, studiesconducted to simulate the conditions that result in passive inhalationhave been conducted in artificially-devised and extremely confining areasthat were poorly ventilated. Also, in order to obtain a positive test result,testing was conducted immediately after this prolonged and intensive exposureto the marijuana smoke. It is unlikely that the identical circumstanceswould be encountered or accurately reproduced outside a laboratory.Finally, the RSPA believes that the safeguards that will be provided inthe DOT Procedures and by the medical review officer (MRO) review processwill preclude misidentification of food substances or licit drugs thatmight produce a false-positive test result. The DOT Procedures providean individual with an opportunity to report any legal or prescription drugsthat he or she may be taking at the time of collection of the specimen.The MRO's broad authority to interpret each confirmed positive test result,to evaluate and interview an employee, based on the MRO's knowledge ofdrug abuse disorders, and to verify that a confirmed positive test resultis accurate should preclude misidentification of licit drugs taken in accordancewith a valid prescription or food substances. In summary, the RSPA believesthat the two-step testing process, coupled with the DOT Procedures andthe MRO procedures, provides a process by which an individual is protectedfrom erroneous false-positive drug test results. <T3>Employees Who Must be Tested. </T3>Many commenters requested that RSPAbroadly identify employees to be tested. They argued that RSPA should notattempt to define each sensitive safety- and security-related functionby job category. Some commenters stated that operators should include intheir Operations and Maintenance (Oandamp;M) Plans a list of job classificationsthey consider to be sensitive safety- and security-related positions.A smaller number of commenters were concerned that the term ``sensitivesafety- and security-related functions'' would be subject to varying interpretationby different operators. Those commenters thought that operator decisionson the types and degree of sensitive safety- and security-related functionsrepresented by an individual's job responsibility would be arbitrary andwould subject an operator to significant potential liability from employeesuits. A few commenters pointed out that more specificity was needed topreclude a court challenge based on state statutes that limit random testingto very specifically identified positions or functions. A few commentersthought all employees of pipeline operators should be tested. Practically all commenters objected strongly to including employees ofcontractors in the drug testing program. Some of the commenters based theirobjections to testing contractor employees on the transient nature of manyunskilled contractor employees. Most commenters pointed out that it wouldbe extremely difficult to assure that contractor employees had been drugtested. Transok, Inc., states that because several months pass betweenjobs conducted by contractors, operators would need to test these contractoremployees every time that they were called in for a job. <T3>RSPA Response.</T3> Those ``sensitive safety- and security-relatedfunctions'' that were proposed for testing in the NPRM have been more narrowlyidentified in the definition of ``employee'' in the final rule. An ``employee''has been defined to mean a person who performs duties for an operator inthe following three functional areas regulated by Part 192, 193, or 195_operation,maintenance, or emergency-response. This narrower definition of ``employee''applies only to persons performing functions directly related to the pipelinesafety regulations. This does not include clerical, truck driving, accounting,or any other functions not subject to Part 192, 193, or 195. These regulationsdo not apply to employees who perform design or construction functionsregulated by Part 192, 193, or 195. The RSPA believes that the design functionis subject to many varying levels of review and the employees performingthose functions need not be tested. The RSPA also believes that it is notnecessary to apply these regulations to employees that perform constructionfunctions. Because the pipeline is pressure tested for strength or leakageupon completion of construction, the RSPA believes that the pressure testwill ensure detection of any construction defects that may have been causedby drug impaired employees.Security-related functions are not covered by the final rule because functionsperformed by security personnel do not directly impact on the safe operationof the pipeline systems. Instead, security personnel provide secondarysecurity protection from outside parties (primary protection being providedby fences, alarms, lighting, etc.). Given the indirect nature of this potentialimpact on safety, we have decided not to include such personnel withinthe anti-drug abuse program at this time. We do, however, encourage operatorsto voluntarily include such personnel in their programs.The ``employee'' definition includes contractors and contractor workers.Although these persons may not be under the direct control of operators,their job performance is no less critical than the performance of employeeswho are employed directly for operators. Pipeline operators who chooseto use contractors to perform their safety-related work have always beenheld responsible for compliance with safety regulations just as if theoperator's own employees were performing the work. A decision to use acontractor rather than one's own employees should not result in a levelof safety lower than intended.However, two aspects of the final rule should assist operators in compliancewhen they use contractors: First, operators may require contractors toimplement their own drug programs instead of including contractor employeesin the operator's own program. So long as the operator is diligent aboutmonitoring the contractor's compliance with such a requirement, the ``knowingly''requirement should protect an operator from unfair liability. Second, limitingthe employees covered by the drug rule to those who perform regulated operation,maintenance, or emergency-response functions, including welding, radiographyand corrosion control on existing pipelines, should minimize the effectsof the rule on operators who employ or contract for unskilled transientlabor.<T3>Pre-employment Testing.</T3> Most of the commenters who addressed pre-employmenttesting agreed with its use and many stated that they were already conductingpre-employment testing. However, some interpreted the proposal to be broaderthan intended and thus to apply to all job applicants. It was recommendedthat pre-employment testing be limited to otherwise successful applicants.A few commenters said that pre-employment drug testing was easily administeredbecause such testing could be conducted as part of the medical examinationthat is required by most operators for new employees.<T3>RSPA Response.</T3> The RSPA believes that pre-employment testing isa necessary component of an effective anti-drug program. Pursuant to therule, a pre-employment drug test is required only when an applicant hasbeen selected for employment to perform certain regulated functions. Inorder to clarify the applicability of this requirement, the RSPA has revisedthe proposed rule. Therefore, the pre-employment testing provision doesnot require an operator to test each applicant for a position. The rulesimply states that an employer may not hire or use anyone to perform certainfunctions until he or she has passed a drug test. Therefore, the employerneed only test a prospective employee who the operator intends to hireand use for a position subject to drug testing. The proposal that operatorswould be required to notify applicants that pre-employment drug testingwould be conducted has been dropped from the final rule because such anotice is not necessary to accomplish the intent of the operator's drugprogram. The RSPA believes that such notice should be left to the operator'sdiscretion.The RSPA believes that the frequency of pre-employment testing is mitigatedby the continuity of an employee's involvement in a drug testing programunder these new regulations in Part 199. So long as an employee is currentlysubject to an operator's RSPA-required anti-drug program, another operatormay use that employee to perform certain functions. If an individual isnot currently subject to an operator's or contractor's RSPA-required anti-drugprogram, whether by termination of a previous contract or previous employment,an operator would be required to conduct a pre-employment drug test beforeusing that individual in a position subject to drug testing. Under the amendment, it would be permissible for an operator to allow acontractor or contractor's employee to continue in the operator's anti-drugprogram after termination of a contract. Similarly, a contractor may chooseto run its own anti-drug program in conformity with Part 199 requirementsto maintain continuity. Particularly in the case of an operator who engagesemployees pursuant to a series of short-term contracts, both the operatorand the employee benefit if the employee is continuously subject to a Part199 anti-drug program. The operator could ``rehire'' the employee at anytime but would not be required to give the employee another pre-employmentdrug test. In addition, the employee could provide functions for anotheroperator on a temporary basis but would not be required to participatein the other operator's anti-drug program or to submit to another pre-employmentdrug test.<T3>Random Testing.</T3> A majority of commenters strongly oppose randomtesting for a variety of reasons. Among these reasons are the lack of evidenceof drug use or abuse in the pipeline industry, invasion of individual privacy,violation of constitutionally-protected rights, and the high costs of conductingsuch testing. Many commenters said that such a testing program would bedisruptive of the normal business activities of pipeline operators andwould have a detrimental effect upon worker morale. This would result inunnecessary administrative and financial burdens.The RSPA received many comments regarding the proposed random testing rates.However, of those commenters endorsing random testing, most suggested thata random testing rate of 10 percent to 20 percent is sufficient to deterdrug use in the pipeline industry.Some commenters argued that if the RSPA proceeds in the promulgation ofa final rule, the random testing of employees should be delayed until theSupreme Court issues a decision on this issue. Some commenters also indicatedthat requirements to randomly test employees for the presence of drugsviolated state statutes (Ohio and Vermont were among the states mentioned).The United Steelworkers of America (Steelworkers) oppose government impositionof mandatory drug testing. The Steelworkers stated that while the publicsupports mandatory drug tests, as cited by the NPRM, that does not meanthe public supports random tests.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The comments opposing random testing on the basisof the constitutionality of and need for the rule have been discussed previously.The costs are discussed below in the Economic Analysis section. The RSPAbelieves that unannounced testing based on random selection is a fundamentalcomponent of an effective drug testing program. Unannounced random testinghas proven to be an effective deterrent to drug use and will provide safetybenefits to the pipeline industry by reducing or eliminating drug use bypipeline personnel. Unannounced random testing programs initiated by themilitary, including the Coast Guard, and private industry show decliningdrug use, evidenced by a decrease in the number of individuals who testpositive for drugs, over the course of the drug testing program.The NPRM proposed a testing rate of up to 125 percent. No commenters providedany data to support a particular level of testing. The RSPA believes thata 50 percent testing rate is sufficient and necessary to establish a validconfidence level as well as to provide an adequate deterrent to drug useby employees. At the same time, this rate should avoid the imposition ofan undue economic or administrative burden on employers and employees subjectto the requiremens of the regulation. In addition, the 50 percent randomtesting rate will produce a sufficient data base for the RSPA to analyzethe scope of any drug problem in the pipeline industry generally or withinany particular sector of the pipeline industry. Analysis of the randomdrug testing data will allow the RSPA to determine if the random testingprogram should be revised, including a revision of the random testing rate.The 50 percent random testing rate is consistent with the random testingprogram currently applicable to sensitive safety-related employees of DOT.The DOT random testing program began in September 1987 and the random testingrate has gradually increased and will reach a level of 50 percent by theend of this year.According to the provisions of the final rule, all operators are requiredto randomly select a sufficient number of employees to enable the operatorto conduct unannounced testing of 50 percent of employees, who performthe applicable sensitive safety-related duties for the operator, duringa calendar year. In order to test 50 percent of the employees who performsuch functions, an operator may be required to select in excess of 50 percentof the employees who perform these functions for unannounced tesing. Selectionof a greater number of employees enables the operator to reach a 50 percenttesting level despite absences due to vacations and medical leave or aninability to reach a collection site due to travel or duty requirements.For some operators, particularly those with a large number of employeessubject to drug testing, it may be a substantial burden to move from nodrug testing directly to a 50 percent random testing rate. If requiredto have tested 50 percent of all covered employees by the end of the firstyear, operators might have to test at rates far above a 50 percent ratetoward the end of the year, to make up for lower rates at the beginning.Operators should be permitted to start out at a lower testing rate andwork up to 50 percent as experience is gained and the testing procedurebecomes administratively more routine. The RSPA does not want to createa situation which might lead to mistakes by requiring initial testing attoo high a rate.The final rule, therefore, provides an implementation procedure that allowsoperators to phase in random drug testing during the first 12 months inwhich tests are conducted. Operators would not be required to reach anannualized rate of 50 percent until the last test collection. The testswould have to be spaced reasonably through the 12-month period to permitthe operator to phase in to the 50 percent rate, and the total number oftests conducted would have to be equal to at least 25 percent of the coveredpopulation.Suppose, for example, that an employer has 1,000 sensitive safety-relatedemployees. At a 50 percent annual rate, 500 tests would have to be conductedduring each 12-month period. During the phase-in period, however, the operatorcould conduct only a few drug tests at the beginning of the program andthen gradually increase the number of tests until, by the end of the first12 months, the annualized rate of 50 percent was achieved. Thus, duringthe phase-in if the operator's anti-drug plan calls for administering randomtests on 12 occasions, the operator would need to administer at least 42tests (500 divided by 12) on the last testing occasion, but could administerfewer tests on earlier occasions. Overall, the operator would have to conductat least 250 random tests during the phase-in period. In subsequent 12-monthperiods, the 50 percent rate would be maintained.<T3>Post-accident Testing. </T3>Many industry commenters stated that theirdrug programs provided for conducting post-accident testing and were generallysupportive of this part of the proposed regulation. However, industry commenterssuggested that such testing should be limited to accidents that reasonablycould have resulted from performance by an employee who was drug impaired.The commenters argued that the proposed rule to test employees whose performanceis directly related to an accident was overly broad.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that a timelimit of 4 hours be set for the collection of test specimens because alonger delay seriously limits the ability of tests to detect the parentdrug or its psychoactive components in the blood. The NTSB further commentedthat toxicological samples collected even after 4 hours may provide usefulinformation and therefore samples should be collected even if the 4-hourperiod has expired. The NTSB also recommended that collection of bloodspecimens be required in all post-accident testing. Some commenters objected to post-accident testing as a separate categoryand suggested that an accident should be one factor in deciding to conducta ``for cause'' test. <T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The RSPA agrees with the commenters who recommendedlimiting post-accident testing and has limited such testing to employeeswhose performance either contributed to an accident or cannot be completelydiscounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An exception is alsoprovided when an employee's performance (e.g., maintenance) may have contributedto an accident, but whose performance occurred so far in advance of theaccident that drug testing would not be useful in detecting drug use atthe time of performance. This limitation in the final rule will ensurethat testing is conducted only when the employee's performance may be causallylinked to the accident and should allay the concerns of some commentersthat a great number of employees would be subject to post-accident testing.The final rule requires that post-accident testing be conducted as soonas possible but no later than 32 hours after an accident. This will ensurethat such testing is not delayed and that the testing be conducted withdispatch. The RSPA strongly encourages employers to promptly determineif an employee is subject to post-accident testing, particularly in caseswhere there is little or no uncertainty that an employee's performancewas a contributing factor in the accident. The RSPA intends to vigorouslyenforce the regulation where there is unreasonable delay in determiningwhether an employee should be tested under this provision or where thereis unreasonable delay in testing after the determination to test is made.The NTSB's suggestion that the RSPA require an employer to conduct post-accidenttesting within 4 hours after an accident is based on the time-sensitivenature of toxicological testing of blood samples. On the other hand, urinalysistesting does not involve the extreme time-critical considerations associatedwith collection and testing of blood samples. The RSPA believes that post-accidenturinalysis testing is sufficient at this time to demonstrate an individual'sdrug use, evidenced by the presence of a drug or a drug metabolite in theindividual's system. Also, the RSPA proposed only urine testing in theNPRM, specifically excluding blood testing as an option, for all drug teststhat would be conducted under the anti-drug program. Further, as notedin the NPRM, the blood test method of checking for the presence of drugsis considered to be a more invasive procedure. Therefore, the RSPA considersNTSB's suggestion to be beyond the scope of the notice and the RSPA hasnot adopted NTSB's suggestion to require post-accident testing by collectinga blood sample. <T3>Reasonable Cause Testing. </T3>The commenters generally supported theconcept of testing of an employee based on reasonable cause. However, theyrecommended that testing be based on reasonable suspicion of drug use,rather than on reasonable cause because the reasonable cause standard isa more restrictive standard. The commenters stated that adopting a ``reasonablesuspicion standard'' rather than a ``reasonable cause standard'' wouldreduce the weight of evidence needed to support and invoke that standardand thus increase the frequency of such tests. Many commenters also thought that the proposal that at least two of theemployee's supervisors substantiate and concur in the determination thatreasonable cause exists to test an employee is too restrictive. While havingtwo supervisors concur that an employee's behavior warrants drug testingmight be desirable in light of the subjectivity of reasonable cause testing,the commenters thought it would not be practical in all circumstances.The particular location of the job site or the time of day might make itimpractical for two supervisors to concur, since many job sites may onlyhave one supervisor and the next level of management may be many milesaway. The commenters wanted operators to be given flexibility in determiningwhether reasonable cause exists. The NTSB questions the requirement fortwo supervisors to concur in the determination that ``reasonable cause''exists and recommended that RSPA modify this requirement to require thatone supervisor can call for reasonable cause testing, but with appropriatesupervisory oversight to discourage abuse. <T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The RSPA has not revised the regulation to be basedon reasonable suspicion, because there does not appear to be a clear distinctionbetween reasonable cause and reasonable suspicion. Also, reasonable causeis the basis for testing adopted by other DOT agencies in their anti-drugrules. The RSPA is not persuaded that only one supervisor should determinereasonable cause because the seriousness of such a subjective determinationshould require the concurrence of two persons. The rule requires that atleast two of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detectionof possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in thedecision to test an employee who is believed to be using a prohibited drug.The decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable beliefthat the employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific,contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probabledrug use. The rule does not require that two supervisors observe the behaviorof a suspected employee. The rule merely requires the concurence of twosupervisors. The RSPA believes that such concurrence between two supervisorscan be accomplished by phone, by discussions a few hours later, or by havinganother supervisor travel to the job site, if only one supervisor is availableat that particular job site.An exception has been made for small operators having 50 or fewer employeessubject to the drug testing program because sometimes these operators donot have two supervisors for every employee. For these operators, the substantiationof one supervisor is sufficient to require that an employee be tested fordrugs, provided that supervisor has received training as required. The RSPA has written the description of circumstances that might triggertesting under this provision in performance-type language. In additionto the broad criteria listed in the rule, evidence of repeated errors onthe job, regulatory or company rule violations, or unsatisfactory timeand attendance patterns, if coupled with a specific, contemporaneous eventthat indicates probable drug use, could provide additional, cumulativeevidence to support a decision to test an employee based on reasonablecause.<T3>Retesting. </T3>The final rule requires that confirmed-positive samplesbe retained for at least 365 days. The rule also creates a right to havethe original sample retested if the employee makes a written request within60 days of receipt of a final test result from the MRO. The employee maydesignate retesting by the original laboratory or another DHHS certifiedlaboratory. The operator may require the employee to pay the cost of re-analysisin advance, subject to reimbursement if the retest is negative. Employee Assistance Programs<T3>Rehabilitation. </T3>The RSPA sought comment in the NPRM regardingfour different EAP rehabilitation options. These options specified thecircumstances under which an employee would be given the opportunity toseek rehabilitation. Option 1 would allow all employees to seek an opportunityfor rehabilitation regardless of how the employee's drug use was detected.Option 2 would allow employees, except those employees whose drug use wasdetected as a result of post-accident testing or testing based on reasonablecause, to seek an opportunity for rehabilitation. Option 3 would only allowemployees who volunteer to seek rehabilitation and would exclude all employeeswhose drug use was detected by any other means. Option 4 would permit eachoperator to determine its policy concerning whether rehabilitation wouldbe offered.Most commenters indicated that rehabilitation of employees should be leftto the operator's determination because federal regulations should notinterfere in the management-labor relationship. Most commenters also saidthat drug rehabilitation was part of union collective bargaining agreementsand those issues should not be subject to federal regulations. Some commenterspointed out the significant problems faced by small operators if a positionwould have to be held open while the employee was rehabilitated. Most laborunions supported Option 1. Most pipeline operators supported Option 4.The NTSB supported Option 3 because the Board believed that employers shouldbe required to remove from service all those employees in safety-sensitivepositions when testing confirms drug use.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>RSPA agrees that rehabilitation is a labor-managementdecision and is not directly relevant to the safe operation and maintenanceof the pipeline. Further, there are significant problems in applying rehabilitationregulations to all segments of the pipeline industry. Therefore, an EAPrehabilitation program is not mandated by these regulations. Nonetheless,the RSPA hopes that pipeline operators will provide rehabilitative assistanceto the employee, especially those employees with long and significant service,by providing those employees an opportunity to be rehabilitated. With respectto NTSB's comment, the final rule prohibits an operator from using an employeein certain sensitive safety-related functions when drug use has been confirmed,unless that individual has successfully completed a rehabilitation program.<T3>Education and Training. </T3>Most commenters supported the EAP educationand training program. Some commenters, however, thought that the type andlength of EAP training should be left to the discretion of the operator.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The education and training proposal in the NPRMhas been adopted in the final rule. In response to a few commenters, someminor editorial changes were made to these requirements to distinguishthe difference in these two facets of the drug program. The final rulepermits an operator to develop and provide education and training as partof an internal program or to contract for these services. Operators maydetermine the extent of employee training. The 60 minutes of training proposedin the NPRM as a minimum for both employees and supervisors has been limitedin the final rule to 60 minutes for supervisory personnel who will determinewhether an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable cause. TheRSPA believes that operators will not have difficulty in developing educationand training programs for employees and supervisory personnel because ofthe many EAP's that are already being conducted by pipeline operators throughoutthe country.<T3>Post-rehabilitation Testing. </T3>Some commenters stated that the RSPAshould not specify the number of post-rehabilitation tests that shouldbe conducted. The commenters recommended that post-rehabilitation testingshould be left to the discretion of rehabilitation and medical personnelafter taking into consideration the particular circumstances of each case.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The RSPA has included a provision regarding unannouncedtesting after an employee's return to duty. This section requires an operatorto subject an employee who has returned to duty following rehabilitationto a reasonable program of follow-up drug testing for not more than 60months after the employee's return to duty. The RSPA believes that thisprogram is required as a minimum to ensure that rehabilitation has beensuccessful.<T3>Confidentiality. </T3>Most commenters stated that drug test resultsshould remain a confidential matter between the employer and the employee,as should any rehabilitation information. Several commenters stated thateven employers should not have access to test results that would identifyemployees, but that such information should be available only to medicaland EAP personnel. Commenters were concerned that disclosure to anyoneother than the employer, without the consent of the individual, could exposethe employer to liability, including defamation and slander suits. Severalcommenters noted that disclosure would violate state privacy laws and compromiselegitimate privacy interests of individuals. Most commenters objected toproviding test results to prospective or future employers, and severalsuggested that test results should be destroyed if an applicant was nothired. Commenters differed on whether RSPA or state pipeline safety agenciesshould have access to records kept on testing and rehabilitation. Mostcommenters opposed access to records but stated that they would not objectto release of general information in the form of statistics. These commentersstated that statistical information, such as the number of persons testedand the number testing positive for certain drugs, could be released toRSPA or state pipeline safety agencies.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The RSPA Has decided that the legitimate individualprivacy rights of an individual warrant strict limitations on the availabilityof drug testing results and rehabilitation information. With one exception,the final rule provides that, other than in statistical form, an individual'sdrug test results and information about an individual's rehabilitationprogram may be released only with the written consent of the individual.The exception is that individual information must be released upon requestby RSPA or an appropriate state pipeline safety agency as part of an accidentinvestigation.<T3>Preemption of State and Local Laws.</T3> Many commenters stated thatstate and local laws, especially those prohibiting or limiting an employer'sability to conduct random drug testing of its employees, could conflictwith this rule. Several of these commenters recommended that RSPA includea regulatory provision that explicitly preempts state or local law on drugtesting in the work place.<T3>RSPA Response.</T3> The RSPA agrees with the commenters that conflictingstate and local laws would interfere with an effective anti-drug program.Inconsistent state or local laws applicable to the subject matter of thisfinal rule would frustrate the safety purposes of the rule and severelyhamper implementation and administration of an anti-drug program. RSPAintends that issuance of the final rule, which mandates the conduct ofan anti-drug abuse program that includes random testing, preempt, underthe Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, any state or local law,rule, regulation, order, or standard that covers testing of pipeline employeesfor the presence of drugs or drug metabolites. This preemption exists tothe extent that the state or local law interferes with implementation ofthe federal law. The rule does not preempt any state law that imposes sanctionsfor the violation of a provision of a state criminal code related to recklessconduct leading to actual loss of life, injury, or damage to property,whether such provisions apply specifically to pipeline employees or generallyto the public. Consistent with RSPA policy that recognizes that a declarationof preemption is a judicial prerogative, no express provision has beenincluded in the rule.<T3>Collective Bargaining.</T3> A major issue raised by many commentersconcerns the effect of collective bargaining on the ability of operatorsto implement Federally-imposed regulations fully and in a timely manner.Those commenters point out that operators who are parties to collectivebargaining agreements are required under the National Labor Relations Actto bargain in good faith with labor unions on issues involving wages, hours,and other conditions of employment. Drug testing for industry employeesand job applicants is a mandatory subject of bargaining under section 8(b)of the National Labor Relations Act. In <T3>NLRB General Counsel Memorandum GC 87-5,</T3> the General Counsel ofthe National Labor Relations Board stated that the implementation of adrug testing program would constitute a substantial change in working conditions.Thus, the commenters state that compulsory urinalysis testing is a conditionof employment with regard to which employers who are parties to collectivebargaining agreements must bargain in good faith.Operators who are parties to collective bargaining agreements may havea more difficult time in adopting anti-drug programs that satisfy Part199 criteria than in adopting broad guidelines that allow more flexibility.The commenters urged DOT to address the collective bargaining issue inits final rule in terms of granting operators sufficient time to adopta drug plan and in allowing operators flexibility in the design and implementationof their drug programs. Commenters stated that employers will be requiredto bargain on the effects of drug testing, such as which positions wouldbe covered, which drugs would be tested for, chain-of-custody procedures,who will pay, the random selection method to be used, and whether unionrepresentatives should be involved in ``for cause'' decisions.Several commenters suggested that RSPA provide additional time to developand implement drug programs. Suggestions included 120 days after expirationof existing agreements, 12 to 15 months after issuance of the rule, and12 months to develop and 18 months to implement a drug testing program.Commenters also mentioned grievance and arbitration issues which coulddelay implementation.<T3>RSPA Response.</T3> Based on the comments, the final rule establishesan extended period to prepare for implementation of the anti-drug program.Operators with more than 50 employees subject to drug testing will have1 year after the general effective date of this final rule to set up testingprograms and EAP services. Drug testing does not have to begin until 1year after the effective date of the rule. Operators with 50 or fewer employeessubject to testing will have 16 months beyond the effective date to implementthe anti-drug program. These periods should provide sufficient time torevise or adopt collective bargaining agreements.<T3>Economic Analysis.</T3> Many commenters disagreed with the economicanalysis of costs and benefits conducted in the Draft Regulatory Evaluation.First, they state that the costs to conduct the anti-drug testing of employeeswere underestimated. The AGA thought that the cost of the initial urinalysistest and confirmatory test would average $200 per employee. The AGA furtherindicated that the per employee costs of random testing should includethe urinalysis sampling, confirmation tests, transporting workers to testsites, lost productivity of workers being tested, testing contractor employees,operating a test lab facility, maintaining a rehabilitation program, andcomplying with DOT recordkeeping requirements. They estimated that 240,000employees were in sensitive safety- and security-related positions andwould be subject to testing, instead of the 116,500 employees thought tobe subject to testing by the RSPA. The AGA stated that they thought itwould cost $60 million dollars per year for random testing alone at theproposed 125 percent sampling rate. The AGA and several other commentersfurther pointed out that the $33 million in estimated benefits erroneouslyassumed that all accidents in which human error was involved would havebeen prevented by drug testing.<T3>RSPA Response.</T3> A Final Regulatory Evaluation has been preparedto reflect the changes in the final rule. The cost estimates of conductingtesting have been revised to be $25 per initial test, $35 per confirmationtest, and $35 for administrative costs. These costs have been verifiedby DOT based on its own testing program. The DOT program indicates thatthe $35 administrative costs include specimen collection, recordkeeping,and chain-of-custody procedures. The cost of the program has been significantlyreduced by limiting the random testing rate to 50 percent, by deletingthe significant costs associated with rehabilitation of employees, by limitingthe types of sensitive safety-related employees that must be drug tested,and by eliminating security-related positions. The discounted costs overa 10-year period of these regulations are estimated to be $29.1 million.The benefits of the program have been revised in the Final Regualtory Evaluationto limit the impact to employees that may have been under the influenceof drugs in accidents that were due to human error or other causes. Inaddition, the evaluation notes the important benefits that would accrueby preventing even one major accident. The estimated discounted benefitsof the program over a 10-year period are $41.6 million.Additional Issues<T3>More Stringent Anti-Drug Programs.</T3> Some commenters said that theircompanies' drug testing programs went beyond the proposed federal rulesand suggested changes to the proposed rules to allow more stringent requirements.The final rule sets forth minimum requirements that must be included inan operator's anti-drug plan. However, the rule generally does not setforth detailed program administration requirements in most areas of theprogram. As a result, a significant degree of flexibility is retained foran employer's administration of its anti-drug program.Section 199.11 of this regulation provides that an employer may test thesample obtained under this rule only for the drugs required or specificallyauthorized to be tested under this rule. That is, an employer must testthe sample for the five major drugs listed in each DOT drug regulation.Only if, in the context of reasonable cause testing, the RSPA authorizestesting for additional Drug X under 49 CFR Part 40 (an approval which wouldbe granted only after consultation with the Department of Health and HumanServices, and only on the basis of an HHS-established testing protocoland positive threshold) may the employer also test the sample for thatdrug.Absent such an approval, if the employer wants to test, in addition, forDrug Y, the employer must obtain a second sample from the employee. Theobtaining of this second sample is not under the authority of the DOT regulation.The employer must base its request for the second sample on whatever otherlegal authority is available, since the employer cannot rely on the DOTregulation as the basis for the request.<T3>Alcohol. </T3>Many commenters suggested that the RSPA include alcoholas a tested substance in any required testing program. These commenterspointed out that alcohol is probably the substance most abused by the public.The comments indicated that some operators already include alcohol in theiranti-drug program.The RSPA expressly excluded the issue of alcohol testing from this rulemakingfor a variety of reasons stated in the NPRM; therefore, these commentsare beyond the scope of the rulemaking. Alcohol testing was not proposedbecause the two preferred methods of testing an individual for the presenceof alcohol are by breath analysis and by drawing blood. If tests were runfor alcohol and for drugs, two different types of tests (blood alcoholconcentration and urinalysis) would have to be conducted. This would greatlycomplicate the process as well as increase costs. Also, the blood testmethod generally is considered to be a more invasive procedure. Finally,it is easier to identify someone who abuses alcohol and reports for workimpaired than someone who uses drugs.Excluding alcohol testing from this rulemaking should not be construedto mean that the RSPA is ignoring the possibility that alcohol may be asubstance of widespread abuse in the pipeline industry. The RSPA may considerrulemaking action against alcohol abuse in the future. Additionally, anoperator is not prohibited from testing its employees for alcohol if theoperator has the independent legal authority to do so.<T3>Prohibited Drugs. </T3>The NTSB believes that the list of prohibiteddrugs is too narrow. The NTSB indicates that it has investigated a numberof accidents in other modes of transportation caused by individuals impairedby drugs in Schedules III to V of the Controlled Substances Act.In the final rule the definition of ``prohibited drug'' has been limitedto the five substances for which drug testing is required: marijuana, cocaine,opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP), except that if an operatorwishes to test for other substances during reasonable cause or post-accidenttesting, it may do so provided it has obtained approval from RSPA, as specifiedin 49 CFR Part 40. In addition, the rule does not prohibit an operatorfrom testing for other drugs if the operator has the independent legalauthority to do so.<T3>Medical Review Officer (MRO). </T3>The RSPA has clarified and expandedthe role of the MRO which is established in the DHHS guidelines. For example,the MRO also is the final arbiter regarding disputes on anti-drug testingprograms and schedules for unannounced testing. The MRO is also responsibleto determine a schedule of unannounced testing, and when applicable, inconsultation with the rehabilitation committee, for an employee who hasreturned to duty after rehabilitation.<T3>State Agency Inspectors. </T3>Most commenters that commented on thesubject thought that state pipeline safety agency inspectors should alsobe subject to a drug testing program. The RSPA plans to establish standardqualifications for state pipeline safety inspectors. The comments on theneed for a drug testing program for state inspectors will be consideredin any future rulemaking regarding those standards. <T3>Small Operators. </T3>Most commenters thought that small operatorsshould also be subject to these drug testing programs. The American PublicGas Association (APGA) recommended that master meter systems should notbe excluded from participation in this program. A few commenters, suchas the Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities, thought that operatorshaving 25 or fewer employees should not be included in this rule. The RSPA believes that the problem of drug abuse is so universal that smalloperators should be subject to these rules to ensure that all the nation'spipeline transportation system is protected from the hazards of drug impairedpipeline employees. Furthermore, because small operators are typicallydistribution companies supplying gas to the public in populated areas,the public exposure is greater. Therefore, small operators are subjectto these rules, except that a change has been made to the reasonable causetesting for operators with fewer than 50 employees subject to this part.In that case, only one supervisor is necessary to determine that thereis reasonable cause for an employee to be drug tested. In addition, smalloperators are given additional time to begin their testing programs. The RSPA has not changed the final rule with regard to master meter systems.Those systems are still excluded from the requirements of these regulationsbecause they do not usually perform the functions traditionally consideredas operating or maintaining a pipeline. The gas distribution company isresponsible for the operational characteristics of the pipeline system.Under the pipeline safety rules, the master meter operator is responsiblefor maintenance of the pipelines on his property. He normally contractsthis out to a local maintenance or plumbing company. If there is a leak,he does not shut off the system or lower the pressure. Instead, the residentof a unit usually calls the gas distribution company, which in turn checksto see if there is a problem and then takes appropriate action. Therefore,the types of incidents that would arise, such as leaks or explosions, wouldnot be prevented by the drug testing of master meter operators. <T3>Action that May be Taken by an Operator. </T3>Some commenters objectedto the proposal that an operator may not discipline or terminate an employeefor drug-related causes if the employee successfully completes rehabilitation.They argued that the proposed rule interjected the federal government intodecisions and regulations between management and labor_an untenable situationto both the supervisors and supervised employees. The RSPA agrees and has deleted this proposal from the final rule. <T3>Suggested Alternative Plan. </T3>Transok, Inc., suggests that insteadof mandating drug testing, the RSPA should impose a fine on employers of$500 for the first drug or alcohol related accident and $5,000 for subsequentaccidents occurring within 5 years of the initial accident. This, accordingto Transok, Inc., would ensure a drug-free transportation system by penalizingemployers who do not adequately supervise employees. The RSPA believes that this approach would not ensure the prevention ofdrug use by pipeline industry employees. First, without a drug testingprogram, the RSPA would not be able to identify the accidents caused bydrug-impaired employees. Secondly, such an approach would not be preventativesince the accidents would already have occurred. <T3>Conflict with Foreign Laws</T3>. We have determined not to make thefinal rule applicable in any situation where compliance would violate thedomestic laws or policies of another country. In addition, because of thepotential confusion that may exist involving application of this rule insituations where compliance could violate foreign laws or policies, wehave determined not to make the rule applicable, until January 1, 1990,in any situation where a foreign government contends that compliance withour rule raises questions of compatibility with its domestic laws or policies.During the next year, the Department and other U.S. government officialswill be working closely with representatives of foreign governments withthe goal of reaching a permanent resolution to any conflict between ourrule and foreign laws and policies. The U.S. and Canadian Governments havealready established a bilateral working group in an attempt to achievethis objective. We believe that considerable progress has already beenmade, and further meetings will be held in the near future. While we believethat this can be a model for addressing the concerns of other countries,it is not intended to be the exclusive means. The Administrator may delaythe effective date further under this section, if such delay is necessaryto permit consultation with any foreign governments to be successfullycompleted. It is the agency's intention to issue a notice no later than December 1,1989, that would make any necessary amendments to the rule as a resultof discussions with foreign governments. Shortly after their issuance,any such notices will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. While we recognize that any decision not toapply our rule to foreign citizens has the potential to create some anomalousconditions in competitive situations, it is the intention of the U.S. governmentto make every effort to resolve potential conflicts with foreign governmentsin a manner that accommodates their concerns while ensuring the necessarylevel of safety by those we regulate. Advisory Committee ReviewSection 4(b) of the NGPSA, as amended (49 App. U.S.C. 1673(b)), requiresthat each proposed gas pipeline safety standard be submitted to the TechnicalPipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) for its consideration. Similarly,under section 204(b) of the HLPSA (49 App. U.S.C. 2003(b)), proposed hazardousliquid pipeline safety standards must be submitted to the Technical HazardousLiquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC). These Committeesdiscussed the proposed rule at a joint meeting held on September 14, 1988,in Washington, DC. The official report of each Committee and the transcriptof the meeting is in the docket. The following sets forth the recommendations of each of the advisory committeesregarding the feasibility, reasonableness, and practicability on the proposedrule and disposition of these recommendations by RSPA. <T3>TPSSC. </T3>The TPSSC voted nine to four that the proposed rule isfeasible, reasonable, and practicable with the following recommended changes:andbullet; Section VI. Adopt Option 4, which leaves rehabilitation to anoperator's discretion. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. RSPA agrees and the requirement for a mandatoryrehabilitation program has been deleted in this final rule. andbullet; Section VI.C. Eliminate random testing. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. As noted previously, the RSPA believes that randomtesting is a critical component of an anti-drug program and that a 50 percentdrug testing rate is necessary to establish a valid confidence level aswell as to provide a sufficient deterrent to drug use by employees. TheRSPA believes that the 50 percent rate will not impose an undue economicor administrative burden on operators and employees. andbullet; Section VII. Eliminate this section regarding restrictions onemployee discipline. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. RSPA concurs, and this section has been eliminatedsince rehabilitation is discretionary in the final rule. andbullet; Section VIII.A. Change time for preparing anti-drug plan from120 days to 1 year. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. The RSPA agrees more time is needed and has adjustedthe compliance date of the final rule. andbullet; Section I. Eliminate applicability to contractor employees indefinition of ``employee.'' <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. As noted previously, the RSPA believes that contractoremployees should be included in the group of employees that must undergodrug testing. Although these persons may not be under the direct controlof operators, their job performance is no less critical than the performanceof employees who work directly for operators. The RSPA has limited theemployees covered by the drug rule to those who perform regulated operation,maintenance, or emergency-response functions, which should minimize theeffects of the rule on operators who contract for unskilled transient laborers.andbullet; Section IV.C. Use more performance language in training. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. The RSPA believes that the requirements proposedfor training generally were already in performance language. However, theproposal to require at least 60 minutes of training annually has been deletedas too specific. The final rule requires that operators provide 1 hourof training for supervisory personnel who will determine whether an employeemust be drug tested based on reasonable cause. The training should includethe effects and consequences of drug use and the manifestations and behavioralcues that may indicate drug use and abuse. The RSPA believes the rule providessufficient flexibility and performance language to permit the tailoringof a training program to fit the operations of each particular operator.If an operator wishes to provide training in excess of the minimum requirementsof this rule, the operator has the option to do so. andbullet; Section IX. Limit access to records to circumstances followingaccidents. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. The RSPA has limited access to the drug testingrecords of a particular employee to when RSPA or a state pipeline safetyagency are conducting an accident investigation. <T3>THLPSSC. </T3>The THLPSSC voted 11 to 0 not to support the NPRM ondrug testing because the need for such a rule has not been demonstrated.However, that advisory committee recommended that if the RSPA issues afinal rule, the RSPA should consider the following recommendations: andbullet; Section IV.C. Eliminate random testing. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. As noted previously, the RSPA believes that randomtesting is a critical component of an anti-drug program, and that a 50percent drug testing rate is necessary to establish a valid confidencelevel as well as to provide a sufficient deterrent to drug use by employees.The RSPA believes that the 50 percent testing rate will not impose an undueeconomic or administrative burden on operators and employees. andbullet; Section IV.D. Eliminate reasonable cause of testing. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. The RSPA has not eliminated this section. The RSPAbelieves that testing for ``reasonable cause'' is a necessary element andone of the cornerstones of the testing program. If an employee is believedto be taking prohibited drugs or under the influence of a prohibited drugwhile on duty, it is incumbent on the operator to determine if that employeeis using prohibited drugs. More over, the comments indicate that most largeoperators are already conducting drug testing when their employees arebelieved to be using prohibited drugs. andbullet; Section VI. Adopt Option 4, which leaves rehabilitation to anoperator's discretion. <T3>RSPA Response</T3>. The requirement for a rehabilitation program hasbeen deleted in the final rule. andbullet; Eliminate the applicability of the proposed rule to contractoremployees. <T3>RSPA Response. </T3>This has not been done for the reasons stated previously.andbullet; Section I. ``DHHS Guidelines'' should be a minimum requirement.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The DOT has modified the DHHS Guidelines and adoptedthem as the DOT Procedures. As in all pipeline safety regulations, theoperator may exceed the requirements as set forth in the federal regulations.andbullet; Section IX. The RSPA should be given access to statistical informationonly.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>As mentioned before, the RSPA has limited accessto the drug testing records of a particular employee to when RSPA or astate pipeline safety agency are conducting an accident investigation.andbullet; Section 195.401(d)(3). Eliminate the absolute prohibition againstan employee having any amount of a prohibited drug in his system.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The RSPA has eliminated this requirement to beconsistent with the ``DOT Procedures'' covering the amount of drug in anemployee's physiological system that constitutes failure of an initialor confirmatory drug test.andbullet; Section VII. Eliminate the restrictions on employee discipline.However, don't eliminate the employee discipline restrictions if randomtesting and testing based on reasonable cause are included in final rule.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The proposed employee discipline restrictions arenot in the final rule. The RSPA does not believe that any restriction onemployee discipline is needed because the final rule does not mandate rehabilitation.Absent mandatory rehabilitation, any restriction on disciplinary actionwould unnecessarily interject RSPA into the management-employee relationship.andbullet; Section VIII. Change time for preparing anti-drug plan from 120days to 1 year.<T3>RSPA Response. </T3>The RSPA agrees more time is needed and has adjustedthe compliance date of the final rule.Regulatory Flexibility DeterminationThese final rules apply to all entities subject to RSPA's jurisdictionunder Part 192, 193, or 195, other than operators of master meter systems.Operators of master meter systems constitute the bulk of small businessesor other small entities that operate gas pipeline systems. There are few,if any, small entities that operate hazardous liquid pipelines subjectto Part 195 or LNG facilities that are subject to Part 193. The final ruleprovides additional time for small operators to prepare their anti-drugplans and begin drug testing. In addition, the rule provides small operatorsflexibility in testing for reasonable cause by allowing one supervisortrained in detection to substantiate the decision to test. Therefore, Icertify that pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,this final rule will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.''Paperwork Reduction ActThe final rule requires that the operator develop a written program andmaintain records on drug testing and training. In accordance with the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), these information collection requirementshave been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval.Information need not be collected under this rule until OMB clearance isreceived and the OMB clearance number is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Federalism ImplicationsThe RSPA has reviewed the final rule in light of the Federalism considerationsset forth in Executive Order 12612. Although the final rule will have tobe adopted by states participating in the federal-state relationships prescribedin the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Hazardous LiquidPipeline Safety Act of 1979, the impact of such adoption based upon currentlyavailable information would not be substantial. In addition, RSPA doesnot expect that such adoption would have a substantial direct effect onthe relationship between the federal government and the states or on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels ofgovernment. This expectation takes into account the preemption of inconsistentstate or local laws governing drug testing as discussed supra. Accordingly,preparation of a Federalism Assessment under Executive Order 12612 is notwarranted.SignificanceThis final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and determinednot to be a major rule because it would not have an impact on the economyin excess of $100 million annually, would not result in a major changein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, government, orany geographic region, and would not significantly affect competition.However, it is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because it concerns a matter on whichthere is substantial public interest and because it involves importantDepartmental policy. The Draft Regulatory Evaluation has been revised toreflect the changes in the final rule. The total discounted cost of theseregulations over a 10-year period is now estimated to be $29.1 million.The discounted benefits of the program have been revised and are now estimatedto be $41.6 million over a 10-year period. A copy of the Final RegulatoryEvaluation has been placed in the docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 199</ITAG>Pipeline safety, Drug testing.In view of the foregoing, RSPA amends Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulationsby adding a new Part 199 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_DRUG TESTING </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.1  Scope and compliance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.3  Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.5  DOT procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.7  Anti-drug plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.9  Use of persons who fail or refuse a drug test. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.11  Drug tests required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.13  Drug testing laboratory. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.15  Review of drug testing results. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.17  Retention of sample and retesting. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.19  Employee assistance program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.21  Contractor employees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">199.23  Recordkeeping. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>49 App. U.S.C. 1672, 1674a, 1681, 1804, 1808, 2002,and 2040; 49 CFR 1.53</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 199.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope and compliance. </ITAG>(a) This part requires operators of pipeline facilities subject to Part192, 193, or 195 of this chapter to test employees for the presence ofprohibited drugs and provide an employee assistance program.
