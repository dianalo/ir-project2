As a resultof the ACRS's concerns, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC)Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) in conjunction with the Officesof Research and Inspection and Enforcement, and the NRC regional offices,embarked upon a program to reevaluate Control Room Habitability. ArgonneNational Laboratory was contracted by the NRC to perform a Control RoomHabitability Study on twelve licensed power reactors. The plants selectedfor the study were chosen based upon architect engineer, nuclear steamsystem supplier, utility, and plant location. The major findings of thisstudy are included in this report along with generic recommendationsof the review team that apply to control room HVAC systems. Althoughthe study is not complete, at the time of publication of this report,the results obtained to date should be useful to persons responsiblefor Control Room Habitability in evaluating their own systems.</TEXT></DOC>
