National Bank of Alaska, the state's largest bank with assets of about $1.8 billion and net worth of $171 million, said it paid $4.1 million for First Interstate.    First Interstate of Alaska had a loss of $15.8 million in 1986 compared with year-earlier profit of $4.1 million, or $1.57 a share. It was closed by the state commisioner of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development, which named the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corp. as receiver. First Interstate Bank of Alaska, a bank holding company, was a franchise of Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp.    The FDIC used a so-called purchase and assumption transaction, which extends protection to all deposits, including those over $100,000. Former First Interstate of Alaska depositors will have their deposits transferred to a National Bank of Alaska account.    National Bank of Alaska said it initially would reopen 15 of First Interstate of Alaska's 18 branches, but would later close an unspecified number of the reopened branches. </TEXT></DOC>
