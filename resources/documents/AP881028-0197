The provincial court hearing is to determine if enough evidenceexists to extradite Ng, a 27-year-old former U.S. Marine, toCalifornia. The hearing has been closed to the public in its secondweek.   Ng, whose name is pronounced Ing, is accused in the slayings of12 people between June 1984 and January 1985. Most of the chargesinvolve sex-torture killings at a rural cabin in Calaveras County,east of San Francisco.   He faces 25 charges in California, including at least 10 ofmurder.   San Francisco police detective Edward Erdelatz said in anaffidavit released by the court on Thursday that he interviewed Ngin Canada about the slaying of one of the victims, Paul Cosner, aSan Francisco car salesman.   After being advised of his rights, Ng said he had a meeting inCosner's car with Leonard Lake, who was also suspected in theslayings, Erdelatz said in a sworn statement.   ``Ng stated that Lake said he (Lake) had just shot Cosner, whosebody was in the car,'' Erdelatz said. ``Ng stated he then helpedLake dispose of Cosner's body.''   Lake killed himself in custody in 1985. Ng came to Canada and isserving a 4{-year sentence for an armed robbery in Calgary, Alberta.   If extradited and convicted, Ng faces possible execution inCalifornia.   Canada has a policy against extraditing anyone facing the deathpenalty. The final decision rests with Federal Justice Minister RayHnatyshyn.   Reporters have been told that the hearing, which was expected tolast five weeks, possibly could end sooner.   Allegations of torture and mass murder in the California deathshave raised questions about Canada's extradition procedure. Asrecently as May, California Gov. George Deukmejian urged CanadianPrime Minister Brian Mulroney to speed up the process.   In a letter, Deukmejian said denying the extradition ``could havethe unfortunate consequence of making Canada a haven for deathpenalty fugitives.''   But Ng's Calgary-based lawyer, Don MacLeod, predicted it could bea long time before Ng heads south. Regardless of the outcome of theextradition hearings, McLeod said, an appeal is likely.   The hearing has attracted widespread attention in Canada, wherethe national news weekly Maclean's said the case ``will provide aclear test of Canada's wilingness to return suspected criminals tojurisdictions where they could be put to death.''   Ng is being held at the maximum security Edmonton Institutionduring the hearing.</TEXT></DOC>
