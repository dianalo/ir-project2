But fund companies are grumbling.    After a two-year debate, the SEC in January voted 3-2 to set strict standards on how mutual funds can advertise performance. The result will be a uniform formula for calculating yields, among other things, that will allow investors to make more meaningful comparisons when shopping for funds.    Fund officials grouse that the rules, set to take effect May 1, are giving them operational and accounting headaches. At the annual Mutual Funds and Investment Management Conference here this week, fund executives said they'll likely need more time to put the systems into place. Some funds seem hard-pressed to understand the rules, let alone implement them.    Many mutual funds &quot;didn't face up to how complicated the (rules) could be,&quot; said James Riepe, director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., a Baltimore-based fund group. &quot;An awful lot of people in the industry are simply not going to get their ads (ready) in that time frame,&quot; he said. Many fund groups, including Rowe, are seeking more time to comply.    But SEC officials aren't sympathetic, noting that the issue has been debated for years. &quot;We gave you guys a lot of rope, but you hung yourselves,&quot; chided Kathryn McGrath, head of the SEC's investment management division. &quot;Now you've got a rule that's not much fun.&quot;    If a formal extension request is made, staffers said the commission will consider it. &quot;But don't assume there will be one,&quot; said Mary Joan Hoene, deputy director of the SEC's investment management division.    Currently, income funds other than money market funds are free to compute and advertise their yield performance any way they wish, as long as it doesn't violate federal securities laws. As a result, funds use different performance figures and disclosure styles, making it hard for investors to make comparisons. (If interest rates were dropping, for instance, funds might often display their one-year average yield; if rates were rising, they might cite a one-week average.)    Under the new rules, an income fund will have to advertise a uniform, 30-day yield figure. Also, if any income or equity fund wants to tout performance, it also must include the fund's average annual compounded total return for the past one, five and ten-year periods. The ads also have to disclose investment risks, among other things.    That means a lot of work for the funds. Here's a catch: While some parts of the yield calculation can be culled from existing account records, other factors -- such as determining dividend and interest -- will require creating new information for each security position in the funds.    The systems' challenge is substantial. A recent report by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse indicated that in addition to developing software and detailed plans to crunch the numbers, funds will have to use judgment in several hazy areas. One is computing yield-to-maturity for bonds subject to being called. Funds are supposed to use the date when the security &quot;reasonably&quot; may be expected to be called.    Some SEC officials suggested the commission will be flexible. &quot;We'll apply the rule to reason,&quot; said Charles Padgett, SEC associate regional administrator in New York. If a fund makes an earnest effort to comply, he said, an enforcement action wouldn't be likely. &quot;But if there's blatant disregard of the rule, that's another issue,&quot; he warned.    The rules' practical effect, fund officials say, is that many funds will stop advertising yield and stress total return. Many officials go further. &quot;Some funds may just not advertise,&quot; said Vincent Nave, senior vice president of Boston Co. Advisors Inc.    A few funds, particularly the largest groups with the most money and staff, will largely meet the May 1 deadline. But some, such as Colonial Group Inc., say they'll try to get only &quot;priority&quot; funds on line for May 1 if they're not fully prepared. Others will simply step to the sidelines. &quot;We just won't be advertising yields,&quot; said Charles Kierscht, president of Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. &quot;We'll wait until the dust settles.&quot;    Meanwhile, load funds are complaining because any sales fees must be computed in performance numbers and disclosed in ads. But no-loads say they'll be hit hardest. They generally don't have brokers promoting their funds and instead are more heavily dependent on ads to entice customers.    Said Mr. Riepe of Rowe, a major no-load group, &quot;Brokers can deal with the numbers in a more facile way.&quot;    ---   Money Fund Assets Drop   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's money market funds fell $730.4 million to $278.78 billion in the week ended Wednesday.    The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said, &quot;Institutional investors withdrew assets from their mutual funds in search of higher short-term yields in the marketplace.&quot;    Assets of 210 general-purpose funds increased $226.2 million to $82.23 billion, and the assets of 98 broker-dealer funds rose $266.2 million to $117.66 billion. But the assets of 114 institutional funds fell $1.22 billion to $78.89 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, fell to 6.04% from 6.06% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for funds fell to 6.07% from 6.10%, and the average maturity of funds lengthened to 44 days from 43 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.47% on money market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, compared with 5.48% the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were unchanged from the previous week at 6.36% for six-month savings certificates of deposit, and 6.70% for one-year bank savings CDs. </TEXT></DOC>
