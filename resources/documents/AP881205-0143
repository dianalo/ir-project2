In 1984, he announced thesale of lifetime memberships for the purpose of financing thehotel's construction, the indictment said.   Lifetime partners were to receive free lodging at the Fort Mill,S.C., complex in exchange for big contributions to PTL.   The indictment alleged that Bakker and Dortch made falsestatements to induce members of the public to buy partnerships andthat the partner funds weren't used to construct the lodgingfacilities promised.   Bakker and Dortch promised that the funds would be used to buildthe Grand Hotel, Tower Hotel, Country Farm Inn, Heritage GrandMansion, a campground and several bunkhouses, the indictment said.But by the time Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987, only theGrand Hotel and one bunkhouse had been completed, the indictmentsaid.   According to the grand jury's report, more than 152,000 fullypaid partnerships were sold producing at least $158 million inrevenue for the evangelical empire built by Bakker and his wife,Tammy, before his downfall in a sex and money scandal in March 1987.   The indictment alleged that Bakker and Dortch diverted PTL fundsfor their own use. Bakker and his wife were given bonuses totalingnearly $3.5 million and Dortch obtained bonuses totaling $550,000,the indictment said.   At the same time, Bakker and Dortch were concealing the truefinancial condition of PTL from the ministry's board of directors,the indictments said.   The defendants were ordered to appear Dec. 15 in federal court.   The maximum penalty for each count of mail fraud, wire fraud,conspiracy and tax evasion is a fine of up to $250,000 and fiveyears in prison.   Prosecutors in the case declined comment. U.S. Attorney ThomasAshcraft said, ``There has already been too much publicity on thisalready and we don't want any more.''   Last month, Bakker, Dortch and Roe Messner, PTL's former chiefbuilder, received letters from prosecutors informing them that theywere targets of the investigation and inviting them to testify.   Only Messner, a Wichita, Kan., contractor, accepted.   Bakker resigned from PTL in a scandal over the payment of hushmoney to Jessica Hahn, with whom he had a sexual encounter in ahotel room in 1980. He was later dismissed as a minister by theAssemblies of God amid allegations that included homosexualencounters.   Former TV preacher John Wesley Fletcher, who appeared on ``ThePTL Club'' from the mid-1970s to 1981 and admitted introducingBakker and Hahn, said in an interview for Penthouse magazine that hehad sex with Bakker three times. He is the second man to saypublicly that he had sex with Bakker.   Bakker denied the earlier allegations by former PTL official JayBabcock.   Three months after Bakker left PTL, the ministry filed forbankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11.   Bakker has denied any criminal wrongdoing. He has called thegrand jury investigation ``a fishing expedition.''      Three months ago he predicted: ``I don't think I'll be indicted.I never have. If I am, I'll be shocked.''   As members of the grand jury left the federal building today, onejuror was asked if he was relieved the investigation was over.``It's all part of life,'' said the man, who didn't give his name.</TEXT></DOC>
