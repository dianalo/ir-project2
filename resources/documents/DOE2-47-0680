Examines effects of accidents and effectsof normal operation which are divided into regional effects (emissionof chemical substances, emission of radioactive substances, emissionof heat) and global effects (emission of carbon dioxide, emission ofradionuclides with a very long half-life). Concludes that economicallyexpressed damage to health and environment is at least 5 times greaterwith coal power plants than with nuclear power plants of similar output(during normal operations), mainly due to emission of carbon dioxide.States that the main risk of using nuclear power is the possibility ofa large-scale accident, although the number of victims has so far beensmaller than in other types of disaster. 16 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
