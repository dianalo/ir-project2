This is complicated by the fact that even in indoorenvironments, with their sharply defined boundaries, numerous variablesneed to be considered, and, because of possible synergistic effects orinteractions, they need to be considered simultaneously. Nevertheless,there is a tendency to make model investigations on a one-variable-at-a-timebasis, assuming that the effects of the variables on the phenomenon ofinterest are additive. Here, a relatively simple approach is presented.It is based on the concept of factorial design, which is used often inprocess development but has been applied seldom in environmental studies.And since all the variables are considered simultaneously, not only canthe main effects of the individual variables be estimated, but also thepresence or absence of a synergistic effect can be detected. The applicationof this approach was tested on a model study, investigating the transferof the biocide Lindane ({gamma}-hexachlorocyclohexane) from a treatedwood surface to cotton fabric. There is reason to believe that possibletoxic effects are less likely to be caused by the incorporation of biocidesthrough ambient air than by absorption from clothing or bedding, whichhave adsorbed and concentrated these materials.</TEXT></DOC>
