Casey Jr., submitted a petition dated June 6, 1989, requestingNHTSA to investigate alleged unreliability of the fuel system in VolvoPassenger vehicles. The petitioner cited, ``* * * serious unresolved questionsand doubt on the reliability and safety of the overall fuel system usedon Volvo 240 model vehicles * * *.'' He contends that the subject vehicleis ``prone to sudden unexpected vehicle decelaration'' resulting from afuel system failure or malfunction. He cites the possibility of accidentsresulting form the alleged problem.The petitioner supports his contention with a ``Risk Factor Analysis''derived from his private survey of other Volvo owners and with a list ofVolvo service bulletins and letters relating to diagnostic procedures andthe introduction of various revised or updated fuel system components.Analysis of the agency's computerized consumer complaint records for the1987 Volvo 240 vehicle disclosed 42 reports related to alleged vehiclestalling. Seven are from the petitioner. The remaining 35 reports are pre-printedinquiry form letters to ODI. They were distributed to Boston area Volvoowners by an unknown source. Except for three complaints these reportsdo not cite stalling problems. Agency review of the petitioner's repairorders and of information from the manufacturer disclosed that three unrelatedrepairs were performed. The manufacturer, in its August 23, 1989, responseto NHTSA inquiry, reported receiving five reports relating to vehicle driveabilityor stalling, including the complaint from the petitioner. The manufacturerreported that, * * * there are no accidents, subrogation claims or lawsuitspertaining to the alleged defect in the subject vehicle known to Volvo.''The petitioner provided a NHTSA-supplied list of Volvo service bulletins.The petitioner referred to those bulletins which described improved fuelpumps and related fuel system components and questioned why his vehiclewas not ``recalled'' for updating with the improved items. Agency examinationof the bulletins revealed no evidence that the problems being correctedby the described product improvements are safety-related.The petitioner also provided an analysis of the results of his Volvo ownersurvey. He did not provide a sample of the survey or the list of ownerssampled or how they were selected. His ``risk analysis'' purports to showthe existence of safety problems in the subject fuel system. The petitionerprovided no evidence of actual accidents, injuries, or fatalities to supporthis contentions.The petitioner has previously been advised by this agency that it is authorizedto order manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles or items of equipmentwhen its investigation indicates that the vehicle or item of equipmentcontains a safety-related defect. A safety-related defect is present whenthere is evidence of a significant number of failures and these failurespresent an unreasonable risk of accident, injury or fatality. He was furtheradvised that the agency cannot act on isolated problems or disputes betweenindividual owners and dealers or manufacturers.In consideration of the available information, the agency concludes thatthere is not a reasonable possibility that an order concerning the notificationand remedy of a safety-related defect in relation to the alleged fuel systemproblems would be issued at the conclusions of an investigation. Becausethe information the agency gathered in the review it conducted in responseto this petition reveals no safety-related defect trend, further commitmentof resources to determine whether such a trend may exist does not appearto be warranted. Therefore, the petition is denied.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 124, Pub.
