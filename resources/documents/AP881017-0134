SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Antarctic ``ozone hole,'' which has raisedscientific concern in recent years, seems to have moderatedslightly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationreported Monday.   The so-called hole is a depletion in the amount of ozone high inthe atmosphere over the South Pole region. Some scientists alsohave found indications of a similar North Pole depletion.   This phenomenon was detected in the early 1980s and raisedconcern because ozone _ a form of oxygen _ helps block harmfulultraviolet radiation from the sun. That radiation has beenassociated with skin cancer.   Instruments sent up in balloons have found that the amount ofozone in the air above Antarctica this month averaged 200 Dobsonunits.   By comparison, measurements averaged 135 Dobson units lastOctober and 165 the October before. They were as high as 250 unitsin 1980.   The Dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing howmuch of each of two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed in the air.That ratio changes depending on the concentration of ozone.   October, which marks springtime in the Antarctic, is the time ofyear when ozone is most depleted over the area, according to WalterKomhyr of NOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories in Boulder,Colo.   However, the apparent improvement does not mean the threat ofozone depletion is reduced, Komhyr said.   Rather, it seems to indicate that natural variations in theatmosphere can lead to large year-to-year changes in ozone, he said.   The ozone hole occurs within a vortex of west-to-east windswhich tend to circle the Antarctic during the winter and springmonths.   This year, Komhyr noted, the temperatures high in the atmospherehave been a few degrees warmer than during the last two years.   The warmer temperatures reduce the formation of clouds in thestratosphere and that may be helping protect the ozone. It iswithin those clouds that chlorine compounds tend to do the mostdamage to ozone, Komhyr explained.   Reducing the release of chlorine compounds has become a majorfocus in recent years. They are largely derived fromchlorofluorocarbons, man-made gases used in refrigeration,industrial processes and as aerosol propellants in some countries.</TEXT></DOC>
