Minimum-deposit insurance is based on borrowing from a policy's cash value each year to pay the premium. The policyholder then takes a deduction for the interest on the loan. Before the 1986 tax law, the after-tax cost for someone in the 50% bracket was half the annual interest and could be cut to zero by borrowing additional cash value equal to half the interest payment.    But the interest deduction is being phased out under the tax law. For individuals, the write-off is cut to 65% of consumer interest this year, 40% in 1988, 20% in 1989, 10% in 1990, and zero after that. Without the deduction, the cost of minimum-deposit insurance &quot;can be astronomical down the road and you'll have to drop the policy,&quot; says Larry Brickner, a vice president at Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co., Avon, Conn.    The thousands of people with minimum-deposit policies that have been in effect for several years can't simply walk away from them, however, because of the tax consequences. The cash value in an older policy usually exceeds the policyholder's cost basis, meaning there is a gain that will be taxable income if the policy is ended for any reason other than the insured person's death.    &quot;It can be a real problem if the policy is in a gain situation,&quot; says David Parsons, national director of financial planning at Oppenheim, Appel, Dixon andamp; Co., a New York accounting firm. Mr. Parsons recently dealt with a client who had $750,000 of minimum-deposit insurance with a $274,000 loan against the policy, net cash value of $44,000, and a potential taxable gain of $177,000. The client would get only $44,000 if the policy ended, but taxes would have to be paid on the $177,000 gain.    Life-insurance companies are working on ways to bail out their minimum-deposit policyholders, says Paul LaPorte, an executive at the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association. The bailouts generally involve exchanging the minimum-deposit policy for a new policy that is based on more recent mortality rates and higher earnings assumptions. Some companies will even exchange new policies for another company's minimum-deposit policy.    Depending on the age of the policy and the loan against it, the policyholder can end up with a loan-free policy with the same death benefit as the minimum-deposit one. Premiums have to be paid on the new coverage, but dividends could significantly reduce the net cost.    A big unanswered question is whether such a swap would trigger taxes on the gain in the old policy. The Internal Revenue Service hasn't said how it would treat such exchanges. &quot;Anybody who is out guaranteeing to make an exchange without a taxable event is kidding himself,&quot; says Robert E. Carlson, executive vice president of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Milwaukee, which has 225,000 minimum-deposit policies.    In a typical bailout example constructed by Northwestern, the company would issue a new policy for one of its old $100,000 policies that carried a $2,205 annual premium, a $91,000 loan and net cash value of $1,860. The new policy would have the same $100,000 death benefit, annual premium and cash value as the old policy -- but no loan. This is possible because the policy is based on the more recent, lower mortality costs and higher earnings than the old policy, and the new policy's death benefit is part cash-value and part term insurance, instead of all cash-value.    For those worried that the gain in the old policy will be taxed, Northwestern will carry the loan over to the new policy, Mr. Carlson says. Then, the dividends are used to reduce the loan each year. Tax specialists say such steps should make it even less likely that the gain would be taxed.    Not all minimum-deposit policyholders need to get out of such arrangements. Depending on the amount of the loan and the dividend that the insurance company pays, it may be better to keep the policy, start paying premiums again, and use the annual dividend to reduce the loan.    Before deciding whether -- and how -- to get out of a minimum-deposit policy, Mr. Brickner says, &quot;We recommend the involvement of accountants and attorneys because we're talking about tax ramifications and long-term commitments.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
