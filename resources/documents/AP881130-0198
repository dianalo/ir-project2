(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who sued the heavy-metal rock group JudasPriest, contending its music drove him to a 1985 suicide attempt,has died after lapsing into an unexplained coma.   ``The Judas Priest lawsuit is going forward. We are not dauntedone bit. As a matter of fact, it's more important than ever,''attorney Timothy Post said Wednesday.   James Vance, 23, was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m. Tuesday atWashoe Medical Center, where he had been in a coma sinceThanksgiving Day, said spokesman David Stipech.   Vance had been on a life support system since he lapsed into acoma. He was disconnected from the respirator after he was declaredbrain dead.   Vance and his parents sued Judas Priest and CBS Records, allegingthat subliminal messages in the British group's music caused Vanceand Raymond Belknap, 19, to make a suicide pact after listening tothe ``Stained Class'' album for six hours while smoking marijuanaand drinking beer.   The two took a shotgun to a church playground in nearby Sparkstwo days before Christmas 1985 and shot themselves in the head.Belknap died instantly and Vance was disfigured after shooting awaypart of his face.   The lawsuit, which was filed by both families, is pending inWashoe District Court.   Judge Jerry Whitehead has ordered CBS to produce the 24-trackmaster tape of the ``Stained Class'' album, but so far thedefendants have found the master for every track but a song called``Better By You _ Better Than Me.''   Prosecution attorneys contend that song contains the hiddenmessage, ``Do it. Do it,'' and claim those words along with otherreferences to death and suicide pushed the young men into their pact.   Without evidence of subliminal messages, Whitehead said the casewould not go to trial since music and lyrics are protected by theFirst Amendment.   If subliminal messages do exist within the ``Stained Class''album, Whitehead said the trial would concentrate on whether suchhidden communication deserves the same First Amendment protection.   Vance was admitted to the hospital's psychiatric ward Nov. 15 fortreatment of depression and was scheduled to be released lastThursday, the day he went into a coma.   An autopsy was pending.</TEXT></DOC>
