Macy andamp; Co. made a surprise bid forFederated Department Stores Inc., challenging a competing offer byCampeau Corp. for the nation's largest department store operator.   The bid Monday by New York-based Macy's is valued at about $6.6billion, topping the $6.1 billion offer from Campeau, aToronto-based department store and real estate company, Federatedsaid in a statement.   Campeau responded today that ``their deal is simply notcompetitive'' and that it was prepared to structure an offer alongthe lines of the Macy's proposal.   Campeau has been trying to buy Federated for more than a month,but Federated's board rejected three successively richer offers. OnFriday, Campeau sweetened its offer again and Federated agreed tostop fighting and start merger talks.   Federated disclosed Macy's offer late Monday night from itsheadquarters here after Federated's board met in New York toconsider the latest, $68-a-share offer from Campeau for all ofFederated's 89.6 million common shares outstanding.   Macy's declined today to comment publicly today on its offer.   Under the prposal, privately held Macy's would make a cashtender offer for approximately 80 percent of Federated'soutstanding shares at $73.80 per share, Federated said.   Federated shares not purchased in the tender offer would beexchanged in a merger transaction, for a number of newly issuedshares of Macy's common stock, equal to approximately 40 percent ofthe unpurchased shares.   No value could immediately be placed on the stock portion of thebuyout offer, but the total offer would be worth about $6.6 billionif valued at $73.80 in cash or stock for all of Federated's shares.   ``The transaction just depends too heavily on the speculativetrading value of the shares of a new highly leveraged combinedMacy's-Federated,'' Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau said instatement.   ``If the Federated board prefers a two-tiered offer rather thanour all- cash $68 offer, we are prepared to structure a transactionalong those lines,'' he said.   The Federated board took no action on the Campeau bid butdirected its management and advisers to investigate Macy'sproposals, to negotiate a definitive agreement and submit bothnegotiated agreements to the board as soon as possible, Federatedsaid.   Federated officials did not know when the board would get theproposals, said spokeswoman Carol Sanger.   The board of directors of the merged company, which would becalled Macy's-Federated Inc., would include significantrepresentation from the existing Federated board, Federated said.   The Macy's proposal would be subject to execution of adefinitive merger agreement, and to approval by the boards ofdirectors and stockholders of both companies. Some Macy's outsidedirectors already have participated in the deliberations, Ms.Sanger said.   Macy's was taken private in a $3.6 billion leveraged buyout bymanagement in 1986. Its stockholders and directors include A.Alfred Taubman, a major shopping mall developer, and Laurence A.Tisch, the chief executive of CBS Inc. and Loews Corp.   The company is one of the nation's biggest and best-knownretailers. Its approximately 100 stores rang up $5.21 billion insales during the year ended Aug. 1.   Cincinnati-based Federated took in $11 billion last year fromits more than 650 department stores, supermarkets and other outletsnationwide, including the Bloomingdale's, Filene's, Burdine's,Lazarus, Bullock's and Gold Circle chains.   Federated stock closed up $2 at $66.50 a share in New York StockExchange trading Monday.   In addition to the Campeau proposal, Federated's board had beenconsidering whether to entirely shun purchase offers in favor of arestructuring that would keep present management in control.   Campeau has been pressing its takeover attempt since Jan. 25. InDecember 1986, the company acquired giant Allied Stores Corp.,whose operations include the Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Brooks Brothersand Ann Taylor retail chains.   Some industry analysts have said they expect Federated tocontinue soliciting other buyers to fend off Campeau's overtures.</TEXT></DOC>
