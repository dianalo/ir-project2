Transitionmetal carbides and nitrides, boron carbide and silicon carbide were selectedfor the experimental phase of this research. Due to their low temperaturecoefficient of resistance and good stability, TiC, ZrC, B sub 4 C andbeta-SiC are suggested as good candidates for high temperature resistancestrain gage applications.</TEXT></DOC>
