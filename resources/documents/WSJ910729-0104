And in fact, the Polish bust is booming.   The streets have lit up with signs and window displays.Every pizzeria -- Warsaw must have 20 -- has an awning in redor gold. Dress shops install track lights, shoe shops soundsystems. Grocery stores put in gourmet counters andcomputerized cash registers that beep. Far into the night,workers hang shelves and paint away the drabness of fourdismal decades.</LP><TEXT>   When Poland cut loose from communism, its entrepreneursdidn't wait, as state managers did, for venture capital thatnever came or foreign aid that is still in the pipeline.Businessmen got down to business, and they are proving thatprivate enterprise -- not privatized enterprise -- will helpPoland escape its past.   Jerzy Czech, a private toolmaker, used to produce a littleutility knife in his suburban shed. He sold it to a chain ofstate craft shops. Then his wholesaler went broke, the chainbroke up, the shops went private and his orders stopped.   &quot;I had to give it up or go bankrupt,&quot; Mr. Czech says. Astate manager in his fix might furlough the work force,borrow from a buddy and pray for a joint venture. Mr. Czechwent for a walk. All kinds of stores were opening, henoticed. In one window, he saw an Italian mannequin made ofmetal tubing. He copied it, and was quickly in clover:&quot;Everything I produce, I instantly sell.&quot; Now Mr. Czech isbuilding a dummy-making machine tool and thinking massproduction.   He was saved by the shopkeepers. The free market's arrivallast year turned Poland's cities into cut-price bazaars. Thestate's hopeless wholesalers and tired retailers caved in.Their employees, along with street traders trading up, tookthem over. In 1989, 20% of retail sales were private; now itis 80%. Private business is already handling 12% of Poland'sexports and 36% of its imports.   Poles benefit from a mercantile mindset only Hungariansmatch in this part of the world. While eastern Germans takecues from western mentors, Czechoslovaks have little to goon, the Soviets far less. Yet for all the grand plans of massprivatization and massive aid, the basic work of building anymarket on the ruins of communism will have to be done fromthe bottom up, mannequin by mannequin.   How does Mr. Czech sell his? Like any Pole with atelevision set, he saw commercials day after day for acompany called Intercommerce. It was pushing shop equipmentthe way Procter andamp; Gamble pushes soap. His head filled withits jingle, Mr. Czech signed an exclusive contract.   The Intercommerce warehouse, past a jam of trucks at theend of a muddy road, was owned by a state potato distributor.Now, its 300,000 cubic feet of cool, cavernous space isprivate property, piled with scales from Korea, cashregisters from Japan and stack upon stack of German shelves,racks, baskets, hangers, supermarket carts, bar-code readers,price-tag tape and check-out counters.   Started by a trader named Rudolf Skowronski, the company'ssales at the beginning of 1990 were $10,000 a month; byyear's end, they were $600,000 a month. Vice President JanuszRaspopin, who left the collapsing state vegetable monopoly,is its chief shop outfitter.   &quot;Someone comes in,&quot; he says in his office above thewarehouse. &quot;I give them a plan in an hour, give them a listof what they need, we truck it over and that's that.&quot; He hasdone it a thousand times.   Imports fill most of the space downstairs, but localproducts have already begun to squeeze them out. Mr. Czech'sdummies are down there already. So are wooden counters fromanother workshop and iron baskets, from another, that stackmore neatly than chrome baskets from Germany.   &quot;It's the finishing touch, the last layer,&quot; says Mr.Raspopin about the rise of local products. &quot;Poles aren'tblind. They know what's up. Private companies will be makingthese things. They'll start simple, and then they'll expand.&quot;   At the end of 1989, Mr. Czech and others with smallfactories, accounted for 8% of Poland's industrialproduction. A year later, the figure was 13%. The statisticsdon't show it (many entrepreneurs tend to be less than honestwith the taxman) but by now it could be as high as 25%.   A fifth of all workers not on Poland's private farmsalready hold private jobs. With social tension rising andstate companies crashing, private ones help soak up theunemployed, tempering the complaints against Poland'seconomic austerity.   The government hasn't capped private wages, either, as ithas the state's; private pay is four times higher. So goodstate workers are quitting before they get sacked, and thatgoads state companies to go private before they areabandoned.   Poland's traders, it seems, haven't only been unloadinggoodies from abroad for a quick zloty. Whether they work outof warehouses, shops or suitcases, they know how to spot whatwill sell -- and that begets production. Production ignites ademand for services and for more production that spreads likea chain reaction.   Just follow the trail of one invoice from theIntercommerce warehouse.   A load of dummies and baskets goes to a company calledMarcPol. In a dingy downtown building, its office entrance --red lacquer, gold lettering -- glares under a spotlight.Inside, Chairman Marek Mikuskiewicz removes a Danish salamifrom his black-marble conference table and expounds onexpansion.   &quot;I'm buying a pharmaceutical company,&quot; he says. &quot;Of courseit will flourish.&quot; Well-fed and 40, he wears a pink-on-pinkshirt, a diamond ring, and has a faded blue tattoo on onehand. &quot;There's an incredible boom on here, amazingopportunities.&quot;   In Poland's black-market days, Mr. Mikuskiewicz ran aprivate restaurant, a kind of enterprise known for itslucrative sidelines. Over 13 years, he managed to &quot;set aside&quot;$400,000 and, in 1989, founded MarcPol. Now he is fresh froma trip to the U.S. and a meeting with Kentucky Fried Chicken.He is also building a plant to process fruit juice and frozenfrench fries. And he won the contract for a $5 millionshopping center on the parade ground in front of Warsaw'sPalace of Culture.   &quot;I pay everything,&quot; he says. &quot;It will be 100% myoperation.&quot; Mr. Mikuskiewicz is thinking mall. Until it iscomplete, though, he and his 400 employees will go on rakingin profits from MarcPol's original business: trading fromwarehouses, boutiques and a nascent chain of supermarkets.   Among the imports in the flashy window of the MarcPolboutique on Mazowiecka Street stand some of Mr. Czech'smannequins. And among the imported clothes they wear is anoutfit by Janusz Chrusciel, who worked for 15 years on Berlinbuilding sites, came home two years ago with &quot;a bagful ofmoney,&quot; and went into the rag trade.   &quot;This is a jungle,&quot; he says, lighting a Dunhill cigarettein the office of his shop in a nearby walk-up. He is 36, inpantaloons and a pony tail. Sportswear, his first idea, was adisaster because of high costs, low prices. So Mr. Chruscielswitched to women's wear. He imports fine fabric and haslured 10 seamstresses away from state mills. Now, his pricesare high.   &quot;I know who buys my things,&quot; he says. &quot;It's people inprivate business, people with good positions in bigorganizations. Recently, I've been dressing the wife of theowner of MarcPol.&quot;   The less lucky can still taste luxury at MarcPol'ssupermarkets. There is one in Ursinow, a monstrous housingproject built for 140,000 people by the Communists without ashopping center. Now Ursinow has a busy MarcPol, with basketsfrom Intercommerce and shelves packed with private importssuch as French wine, Dutch cheese and Italian olives,alongside the state's pathetic efforts.   Squeezing in between them is a new category: Polishcroissants from private bakeries; Polish mustard, privatelyproduced, with the sticker on straight for a change; and aline of Polish ice cream in plastic tubs with a top-notchlabel. The brand is &quot;Sulima,&quot; named after Stanislaw Sulima,the man who makes it.   In moca-almond and strawberry swirl, Mr. Sulima has struckgold. Poles may be tightening their belts, but at the MarcPolthey will buy all the ice cream they can eat if it's good,and Sulima is good ice cream. It's made from Polish cream andItalian flavorings in a small white building 15 miles outsideWarsaw. In the yard one day, a crew of workmen (private, ofcourse) are putting up an extension.   &quot;We want to flood the boom with ice cream,&quot; Mr. Sulimasays inside, serving his guest a cup of chocolate chip. As hespeaks, a young man shows up looking for a job. A salesmanhawks a lamp that kills bugs. And a man who owns arefrigerated warehouse arrives to beg for a shipment. &quot;Maybein a month,&quot; says Mr. Sulima.   At 26, in 1981, he went into business fillingcarbon-dioxide cartridges, and made the switch to his hotproduct last year. He bought an ice-cream machine in Italyand brought the plastic tubs in from Austria. To produce thelabel, he hired Maciej Krawczyk, who has a print shop downthe road. To design it, Mr. Krawczyk hired Jacek Ebert, anartist free-lancing from a Warsaw garret. And Mr. Ebert hiredphotographer Jacek Wolowski to arrange the scoops and takethe pictures.   &quot;As you can tell, we paid a lot of attention to thepackage,&quot; Mr. Sulima says. &quot;That's the key to success.&quot;   To pay for all this, he dug up $25,000 of his own moneyand borrowed $25,000 more. The loan came from the Bank forEconomic Initiative, which uses its Polish initials: BIG.   BIG represents another level of the boom. It was foundedin 1989 by a group of state companies. Today, after two sharesales, 1,100 individuals own 90% of it; many of them wereregulars of the Communist regime. BIG wants big clients. Ithas already handled one privatization, and is the firstPolish bank to issue Visa cards. Still, BIG is small. Itdidn't turn Mr. Sulima away, and it soon may have a chance towelcome him back.   &quot;We want a string of ice-cream parlors,&quot; he says. He isalso backing a man who copies Italian ice-cream machines, andtalking another into making those plastic tubs. Mr. Sulimaneeds more loans to manage his ambitions, and more sales. Anad campaign is in order, he thinks. If so, he would do wellto stop in at ITI, the ad agency that set off this particularchain reaction by filling Mr. Czech's head with its jinglefor Intercommerce.   International Trade andamp; Investment, though its offices arein a private house, with a satellite dish on the roof and aMercedes in the driveway, has 550 employees, and its salesthis year may touch $200 million.   Its founders are Mariusz Walter, a producer fired by stateTV during martial law, and Jan Wejchert, who opened Poland'sfirst car wash. They began making commercials in 1984. Barredfrom the air, they put sets in hotel lobbies, then won theHitachi distributorship for state hard-currency shops -- andbuilt a potato-chip factory.   &quot;It didn't fit the image,&quot; says Riszard Sibilski, a youngjazz promoter turned ITI finance director. &quot;But potato chipswere very effective, capital-wise.&quot;   The next year, commercials appeared on TV and the state,relenting, let ITI make them; now it has 60% of the market.Three years later, ITI signed on as tape-pirate watchdog forWarner Home Video. Last year, it opened a licensedtape-copying plant, dubbing soundtracks into Polish anddistributing legitimate videos to 10,000 private rentalshops; now it has 90% of that market.   Hitachi sales have since surpassed $50 million a year, andITI has opened 30 stores of its own, selling Japanese TV setsfor zlotys. For Warner Bros., ITI distributes films among 400privatized theaters. It is about to merge its ad agency intoa joint venture with McCann-Erickson. It bought 17.5% ofExbud, a money-making construction company the state floatedon Warsaw's new stock market.   Impatient with Poland's high taxes and terrible phones,ITI has moved its legal headquarters to Dublin. Mr. Wejchertmoved, too, and took on an Irish accountant named PatrickShortall to be president. Now ITI is building Hitachi anoffice building in Warsaw and angling for the rights to startPoland's first private TV network.   ITI is the model of a Polish private enterprise.Recounting its progress, Mr. Sibilski, the finance director,has energy left for one more tidbit: &quot;We're planning amanufacturing operation -- Exports West, entering the worldcommunity.&quot; He pauses to catch his breath and grins. &quot;We're aserious outfit, I'd say.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
