Many of these new funds concentrate on tax-exempt municipal bonds. This week, Dreyfus Corp. said it registered a 50 million share, $500 million offering of Dreyfus Strategic Municipals Inc. And last week, Van Kampen Merritt Inc. registered three closed-end fixed-income funds with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Two of those would specialize in municipals.    Proponents say closed-end funds, which don't issue or redeem shares to meet demand, may have an advantage over conventional mutual funds in the municipal bond area.    &quot;Investors are just coming around to realizing it now,&quot; Gene Strandberg, a vice president at Van Kampen Merritt, says. In a time of rising interest rates, he says, &quot;You don't have redemptions. You never have to sell out of the portfolio in a bad market,&quot; as many open-end funds had to do late this spring. As the mutual fund houses sold securities to meet investor redemptions, they contributed to the declines in the market and in net asset values.    With closed-end funds, investors instead sell their shares to other outside investors. In a bad market, though, such a sale might have to be at a discount to the fund's net asset value.    But Thomas Herzfeld of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors Inc., a South Miami, Fla.-based money management concern specializing in closed-end funds, says he finds it &quot;very discouraging&quot; from the investor's point of view that underwriters and advisers are &quot;marketing these (closed-end funds) so aggressively.&quot;    The big expansion of supply, he says, is having a little-noticed, unwelcome effect on shares.    &quot;Because closed-end funds are based on supply and demand, a large increase in supply puts downward pressure on share prices,&quot; he says.    By his count, 45 closed-end funds were brought to market from January 1986 to June 1987. Of those, at least four have been municipal bond funds. Overall, Mr. Herzfeld figures that $11.4 billion of closed-end assets have been brought to market since the start of 1986, probably generating more than $700 million of underwriting commissions and $100 million of advisory fees.    &quot;The advisers and underwriters are doing nicely,&quot; Mr. Herzfeld says. &quot;Yet investors in a few cases haven't made any money and in some cases have lost money. I attribute that to the proliferation of supply.&quot;    In any case, analysts expect the boom in closed-end bond funds to continue. In Van Kampen Merritt's case, the three filings cover a current income trust, which can invest in a wide range of fixed-income securities, a high-yield municipal trust and an insured municipal trust. American Portfolio Advisory Service Inc. would be the investment adviser to each of the funds.    Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. plans to underwrite the Dean Witter Tax-Free Income Trust, which recently registered $60 million of shares. A Dean Witter unit would be the investment manager.    In addition, a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. unit, Fund Asset Management Inc., would be the investment adviser to the Munimax fund, which recently registered $115 million of shares, and the MuniInsured Fund, with $100 million of shares. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets would underwrite both offerings.    Despite all the closed-end funds being brought to market, Van Kampen Merritt's Mr. Strandberg says: &quot;We think there's some room left in the market. There's demand for closed-end funds right now.&quot;    ---   Money Fund Assets Rise   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 386 money market funds rose $2 billion to a record $240.57 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said.    The previous record was $239.33 billion, set the week of May 27. This week's rise was the fourth in a row for the funds' assets.    &quot;Institutional investors moved money from short-term credit instruments to higher-yielding money market funds,&quot; Alfred P. Johnson, vice president and chief economist at the institute, said. At the same time, he said, some investors in general purpose funds and broker-dealer funds may have taken profits on their equity funds and shifted some holdings to money market funds.    Assets of 200 general purpose funds rose $915.4 million to $68.35 billion, and assets of 90 broker-dealer funds increased $426.9 million to $105.33 billion. Assets of 96 institutional funds gained $652.9 million to $66.90 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds in the week ended Tuesday dropped to 6.01% from 6.05% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield fell to 6.04% from 6.05%. The average maturity of funds remained at 45 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.39% on money market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, unchanged from the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service.    Bank yields were 6.47% on six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 6.50% the previous week, and 6.85% for one-year bank savings CDs, unchanged from the week before. </TEXT></DOC>
