This is one of aseries of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the economic,social and political turbulence that has turned South America intoa continent in crisis.</TEXT><NOTE>By TODD LEWAN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South America's young are losingfaith in their debt-ridden continent's future. They are emigratingin ever-growing numbers to escape deepening economic and socialcrises in their homelands.   Angry with widespread nepotism, patronage and corruption intheir governments and frustrated by shrinking job markets, more andmore youngsters are lining up outside emigration offices for visas,hoping to pursue careers in the United States or Europe.   In Rio de Janeiro alone, on every business day, visa lines ofabout 200 people form outside the U.S. Consulate. Most in the linesare young.   Similar lines are seen in such capitals as Buenos Aires inArgentina and Montevideo in Uruguay.   Young people, youth leaders and professional counselorscontacted by The Associated Press in eight South American nationssaid 16 to 21-year-olds doubt a ready solution exists to thecontinent's inflation, joblessness, indebtedness and economicstagnation.   ``It's like inheriting a nightmare,'' said Luciana Jorge daSilva, 16, a high school sophomore and a youth leader in Santos,Brazil. ``You don't know exactly when it began or how to end it.''   Widespread anxiety has replaced a mood of optimism born 10 yearsago when a number of South American countries began a passage fromdictatorship to civilian rule.   Since then, the region's youth have seen civilian authorityerode from within by corruption, inefficiency and governmentindecision and challenged from without by disgruntled militaryofficers, drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas.   Newly restored press freedoms have exposed violence,environmental abuse and social injustice often hidden duringmilitary rule, forcing the young to view their countries in a new,painfully realistic manner.   ``We are victims of a lost decade,'' said Marcelo Rodrigues deCarvalho, 21, a university biology student in Rio de Janeiro. ``Oureconomies are in ruins, we are financially exploited by the U.S.and Europe, and we have lost our cultural identity.''   Runaway inflation, shrinking buying power and spiralingunemployment add to the gloom.   University students often abandon school to become maids, streetpeddlers, movie ushers or black marketeers.   Raul, 18, is one of some 3,000 money changers on the streets ofLima, the capital of Peru.   ``I change dollars now because it's the only way for me to makedecent money,'' he said. ``Besides, I'm not strong enough to carryheavy loads and I'd rather do this than steal.''   In Venezuela or Chile, two of South America's more economicallystable nations, there is a vague awareness among young people thatthings are getting worse.   ``Finding a job will be more difficult than graduating,'' saidCarlos Garofalo, 18, a college freshman in Caracas, Venezuela,studying electrical engineering.   In some countries, desperation turns to violence.   In Colombia and Peru, where leftist insurgenices have grown, thenations' young play a key role in armed struggle against governmentforces. In Peru, the average age of a guerrilla fighter in theMarxist Shining Path group is 16 to 20.   Unemployment and deficient educational systems have likewisetriggered a steep rise in drug and alcohol abuse among youth acrossthe continent, especially in slums around large metropolitancenters.   A recent survey of high school students in Montevideo, Uruguay'scapital, found that 11 percent of 13-to-17-year-olds were drug oralcohol addicts. In 1987, more than 44 percent of Peruvians 19 to24 consumed cocaine paste, according to police figures.   In Rio de Janeiro, slum dwellers are often organized and ruledby young narcotics kings who train children as young as 12 to useguns and run cocaine to customers in wealthy suburbs.   In Santiago, Chile, where various social research organizationsestimate that more than 500,000 young people in the metropolitanarea of 4 million are underemployed or unemployed. Drug abuse isrampant there too.   Juan Reyes, 19, who works as a doorman at the garage of a majorSantiago bank, said, ``In the ghetto where I live, there were twokids who used drugs a few years ago. Now, there are dozens who doit. And many others drink. It's because they have nothing to do buthang around.''   The economic squeeze has made a college education impossible forall but the elite. In Chile, where the minimum legal salary ofabout 38 percent of the population is the equivalent of $72 amonth, state-owned universities charge $120 a month tuition.   In Brazil, where only 35 percent make more than the minimum wageof $85 monthly, an average college tuition upwards of $130 a monthis far out of reach.   Allessandra de Oliveira Nobre, 17, dropped out of a Rioinstitute that trained flight stewardesses to take a job in aMcDonald's for $20 a month.   ``My life seems like it's over and I haven't even had a chanceat a career,'' she said.   Still, most student and vocational couselors regard a collegediploma as little more than a piece of paper.   ``Young people go to college knowing they'll get a degree, butnot a job,'' said Sen. Enrique Bernales of Peru.   ``What does education in Argentina do for young people?'' saidRoman Ojeda, 20, a pre-law student at the University of BuenosAires. ``It gives them the opportunity to leave Argentina.''   Indeed, escape seems the only way out.   In Buenos Aires, long lines snake around blocks outside theItalian and Spanish embassies, where work papers can be obtainedeasily for children and grandchildren of Italians and Spaniards.   In Montevideo, one survey indicated that a third of people 15 to29 years old hope to leave Uruguay to find a better job in Spain,Argentina or the United States.   At the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, the young apply forstudent visas or work permits.   Yet while history shows that South American teen-agers oftenlook to the armed forces to provide leadership in times of crisis,this is not happening today, at least in part because of growingawareness that the continent's social crisis and foreign debt wereleft behind by preceding miltiary regimes.   As a result, most guidance counselors and vocational expertssay, the brain drain will deprive South America of talent neededfor economic development.   Young people, though aware of economic strains imposed by SouthAmerica's $277.4 billion foreign debt, overwhelmingly blame corruptgovernment officials for their nations' problems.   ``Everybody knows they're all thieves,'' said Maye Villarroel,15, a high school student in Caracas, reflecting what seems to be ageneral sentiment among youths.   More alarming to some, such as Brazilian career counselor PauloQuintanilha Nobre de Mello, the continent's economic decay seemsdirectly and indirectly linked to a ``savage individualism'' andmoral decadence.   ``Everybody is responsible for the current situation,'' saysDaniel Lin, 17, a high school student in Buenos Aires. ``Butabsolutely nobody takes responsibility.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 4</NOTE></DOC>
