The tax demand, assessed Friday by the Tokyo regional taxoffice, is the first penalty levied against the so-called BigFour securities houses -- Nomura Securities Co., DaiwaSecurities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and Yamaichi SecuritiesCo. -- since a scandal erupted two weeks ago over asecurities-industry practice of compensating selected clientsfor stock-and-bond-trading losses they otherwise would haveincurred. The presidents of Nomura and Nikko resigned twoweeks ago over the scandal, as well as over reports thattheir firms had lent money to an organized-crime syndicate.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the furor over the loss-compensation scheme forthe first time tainted the banking industry, with pressreports that two unidentified banks received fees for passingalong underpriced securities on behalf of Nomura, the world'sbiggest securities house. A Finance Ministry official said heknew of the allegations but said it wasn't clear that thebanks had done anything illegal.   The latest reports, which surfaced over the weekend in theJapanese press, depict Nomura's method of reimbursing favoredclients for stock-trading losses as global money launderinginvolving other Nomura clients, as well as the New York andHong Kong branches of two major Japanese commercial banks.The other clients and the banks bought underpriced bonds fromNomura and sold them to the brokerage firm's favored clients,who were able to sell them back to Nomura at a profit. TheMainichi Shimbun, which first reported the allegations, saidNomura used the method after the October 1987 Black Mondayglobal stock-market crash.   Nomura officials were unavailable to comment on the latestreports. They have conceded that the company paidcompensation to some big institutional clients but haven'tdisclosed the methods used.   According to the tax authorities in Tokyo, though, thesecurities firms failed to report the income they paid out ascompensation, calling it instead &quot;trading losses.&quot; As aresult, the government said it will require all of them tocome up with additional tax payments and penalties.   Nomura must pay an additional 4.05 billion yen on aboutnine billion yen it paid out to clients; Daiwa was ordered topay out 670 million yen on undeclared earnings of 1.5 billionyen; and Nikko and Yamaichi each were ordered to pay around2.16 billion yen on compensation that totaled about 4.8billion yen at each firm.   Moreover, in order to avert the possibility of futurecompensation schemes, a senior Finance Ministry officialFriday said the government soon would ban discretionaryaccounts that allow securities firms to buy and sell stock onbehalf of a client without informing the client. Losses thatthe securities firms incurred in such accounts were amongthose for which the firms later compensated clients. HiroshiYoshida, vice finance minister for administrative affairs,said the securities industry will be expected to policeitself more aggressively.   At the same time, his boss, Finance Minister RyutaroHashimoto, ruled out the possibility of establishing aspecial securities industry watchdog like the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission. Mr. Hashimoto noted that Japan'ssystem differs from that in the U.S. because securities firmsin Japan are licensed, and thus more tightly controlledalready.   &quot;Japan would rather enhance the current system'sperformance and quality to supervise the financial circlemore effectively,&quot; the finance minister said.   But calls for reform in the industry are rising. Oneindication of popular support for change came when the cityof Kobe, a port in southern Japan, said it would remove allof its business from the Big Four brokerages for anindefinite period.</TEXT></DOC>
