<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-0073 </DOCNO><TEXT>To control the hazards associated with the handling, storage, use andrelease of toxic gases in the manufacturing process, a number of codesand regulations have been promulgated. At the forefront of these regulationsare the Uniform Fire Code (UFC), Article 51, ''Semiconductor FabricationFacilities Using Hazardous Production Materials,'' 1985 Edition; UFCArticle 80, ''Hazardous Materials,'' 1987 Revision; and the Toxic GasModel Ordinance, California Assembly Bill 1021. Article 51 of the UFCis specific for semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities and regulatesthe storage, handling and use of hazardous production materials. Article80 of the UFC has a much broader scope and incorporates requirementsfor prevention, control and mitigation of dangerous conditions relatedto hazardous materials. As it applies to toxic gases, Article 80 incorporatesArticle 51 requirements and in addition requires treatment systems toreduce discharge concentrations and mitigate unauthorized releases oftoxic gases. The Toxic Gas Model Ordinance is specific to toxic gasesand regulates storage, handling and use of toxic gases at new and existingfacilities incorporating monitoring and treatment systems should an unauthorizedrelease occur. This paper will focus on these regulations as they applyto toxic gases used by the semiconductor and photovoltaics industries.</TEXT></DOC>
