Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo is vilified by union members.Pilots and flight attendants walk off their jobs. Stranded travelersare irate.   The scenario is not unlike the one that climaxed Thursday withthe reorganization filing by strikebound Eastern Airlines inbankruptcy court in New York.   But in an earlier series of tumultuous events, the bankruptcycourt was in Houston, the year was 1983, and the airline taken tocourt was Continental.   Continental, then the nation's eighth-largest carrier, filed forprotection Sept. 24, 1983, closed for three days and then re-openedas a non-union discount carrier, generating public acceptance byoffering $49 fares anywhere it flew in the United States _ fares thepublic found too good to pass up.   Continental employees would bear the brunt of the changes. Somesalaries were cut in half. The workforce of 12,000 was cut bytwo-thirds. And it would be two years before Continental unveiled aplan to fully repay nearly $1 billion to creditors.   Continental's labor strife could be tracked to 1981, when theairline asked that its agreement with the Machinists be amended tochange pay rates and work rules and conditions. By 1983, a federalmediator in the talks threw up his hands.   A month later, on Aug. 13, 550 Machinists were laid off, theirjobs abolished. The next day, the union struck.   The bankruptcy court filing came six weeks after that.   On Sept. 29, 1983 _ two days after Continental returned to theskies _ the airline told pilots they could not strike under theFederal Railway Labor Act.   Pilots and flight attendants called the airline's bluff, walkingoff their jobs Oct. 1. Continental sued the pilots union for $50million. The Air Line Pilots Association countersued, upping theante to $100 million.   Continental kept flying.   The pilots union threatened slowdowns at other carriers.   Continental kept flying.   Seven weeks after the filing, airline capacity reached 50percent. By April 1984, Continental was up to 85 percent of thecapacity it had before the bankruptcy action.   First to show cracks in solidarity were pilots. Only one monthafter they walked off their jobs, 500 of them _ more than one-thirdof the original pilot workforce _ were back in Continental cockpits.   It would be two years before ALPA totally gave in. Picket lineslong gone, the union in September 1985 authorized members to returnto work.   Six months earlier, the Machinists and the Association of FlightAttendants had ended their walkouts. By then, 50 percent of the2,000 Machinists and 60 percent of the 2,600 flight attendantsalready had returned to work.   The costs of filing for bankruptcy accounted for $25 million ofthe airline's $77.2 million third-quarter 1983 loss.   But Continental, which lost $260 million in 1982 and 1983, showeda $50.3 million profit in 1984. And in early 1986, parent companyTexas Air bought Eastern.</TEXT></DOC>
