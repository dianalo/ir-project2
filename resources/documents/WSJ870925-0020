Mr. Baker didn't give details of that lengthy meeting. But the two men apparently talked about whether to try to get Japan and West Germany to lower their interest rates in return for the Fed's rate increase. Mr. Baker is said to have favored such a move initially, but he and Mr. Greenspan ultimately agreed not to seek coordinated action because it would require a delay in the Fed's rate increase, and probably wouldn't have been possible anyway.    Mr. Greenspan was under pressure to demonstrate his inflation-fighting resolve to both the domestic and international financial markets, and any delay would have weakened the message he was trying to send.    Mr. Baker said yesterday he thought the discount rate increase &quot;was the right action at the time and we continue to think it is the right action.&quot;    The Treasury secretary disclosed the lengthy meeting during an interview on NBC-TV's &quot;Today&quot; show. The comments were in a portion of the show that was pre-empted on many television stations by local broadcasts.    Although the Federal Reserve Board is designed as an independent institution, the long meeting between Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Baker is a sign of the close ties between the new Fed chief and the Reagan administration. Mr. Baker was instrumental in getting Mr. Greenspan appointed to the Fed chairmanship.    A report in the New York Times yesterday said the Fed chairman &quot;rebuffed appeals&quot; from the Treasury Department to ask West Germany and Japan to lower their interest rates, causing &quot;the first apparent conflict&quot; between the two men.    Treasury and Federal Reserve officials refused to comment publicly on the newspaper report, which quoted an unnamed administration official. But while Mr. Baker is known to have favored negotiating with Japan and West Germany, he is also said to have understood the pressures on the new Fed chairman to act immediately in order to demonstrate his inflation-fighting credentials.    The Sept. 4 discount rate rise was applauded publicly by the Reagan administration, and was also supported by three other Reserve Board members appointed by President Reagan. </TEXT></DOC>
