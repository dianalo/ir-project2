The move follows the surprise ouster of president ChadliBendjedid. Mr. Bendjedid announced his resignation onnational television Saturday night after 13 years in power.He was succeeded by Algeria's Constitutional Council and aspecial State Security Panel, composed of the militaryofficers and others.</LP><TEXT>   In a first round of voting Dec. 26, Islamicfundamentalists won 188 of 231 seats on the ballot, almostassuring them of obtaining the parliamentary majority in thesecond round. A fundamentalist victory in Thursday'selections, which had been widely expected, would pave the wayfor the first Islamic republic in North Africa, and wouldmake Algeria the world's first nation to bring Islamicradicals to power through the ballot box. That prospect wasworrisome to many domestically and internationally.   The platform of the fundamentalists' party, the IslamicSalvation Front, promises better economic times, but alsocalls for banning the consumption of alcohol, separating thesexes at school, and protecting the family -- a positionwidely interpreted as denying jobs to women.   Mr. Bendjedid's departure, which had all the marks of abackstage military coup, provides a temporary solution toAlgeria's fundamentalist threat. In the event of thepresident's resignation, Algeria's constitution calls forpresidential elections to be held within 45 days, duringwhich time the current government cannot be altered.   Thus, by ousting Mr. Bendjedid, Algeria's militaryleaders, who have pledged to uphold the nation's &quot;unity&quot;against the fundamentalists' threat to impose Islamic law,have bought some badly needed time without announcing ablatant coup d'etat. Council members include acting head ofstate Abdelmalek Benhabyles, who took over from Mr.Bendjedid, top members of the army and security forces, theprime minister and the defense, interior and justiceministers.   &quot;The threat is much less immediate now,&quot; said ZoubidaHaddab, a political scientist at the Univerity of Algeria.&quot;But it's only a stop-gap measure; the Islamists haven't goneaway.&quot;   The Islamic Front vowed to make Algeria an Islamic stateand described democracy as &quot;atheism.&quot; The fundamentalistparty's provisional leader, Abdelkader Hachani, termed Mr.Bendjedid's departure &quot;a piece of theater aimed atsuppressing the people.&quot; His statement warned &quot;against anymeasures to thwart the people's choice.&quot;   The independent newspaper El-Watan said that &quot;the bigunknown is how the Islamic Salvation Front will react. Itmust feel extremely cheated out of certain victory in thelegislative elections.&quot;   One Islamic Front leader who declined to be named said thefundamentalists' reaction to cancellation of the electionswill depend on how the government proceeds. For now, he said,the Front doesn't plan to mobilize its people in the streets.&quot;If the president of the Constitutional Council decides tomake the second round {of legislative elections} after thepresidential election, that will be OK,&quot; he said. &quot;We're forthe constitution.&quot;   Though all was normal in the streets of Algiers thisweekend, except for the occasional tank and soldier withbayonet, the fundamentalists are expected to seek vindicationif a presidential election is actually held. A statementissued by the Defense Ministry reaffirms the military'sloyalty to the constitution. But that loyalty would be sorelytested in a presidential campaign in which a fundamentalistcandidate would be a clear favorite.   The Algerian situation illustrates the problems ofintroducing democracy to a Muslim country with extremepoverty and bad memories of Western colonialism. Sincewinning its independence in 1962 after a long war withFrance, Algeria has vacillated between socialist andcapitalist models, and between its French, Arab and NorthAfrican heritages.   Today, the core of the Islamic fundamentalists' support isamong Algeria's 21 million people under age 30-75% of thepopulation -- many of whom have no jobs and little hope ofimprovement. Unemployment runs officially at 23%, butAlgerians say it's much higher.   An exhibition at the Islamic Front's headquarters hereprovides few details of the fundamentalist economic program,but prosperity is assured in an Islamic state, they say, fromsuch Koranic instructions as government control of wages andprices. As for women, the display says they will be requiredto wear traditional Muslim garb, including head coverings.   Many Algerians think Mr. Bendjedid was asked by themilitary to resign because he didn't take a hard enough lineagainst the fundamentalists. Though he denied it, the localpress reported before his resignation that the president metwith Islamic leaders -- an allegation that dovetailed withthe Front's proclamation that Mr. Bendjedid should serve theremaining two years of his term, rather than resign as theFront had previously demanded.   &quot;The military lost confidence&quot; in Mr. Bendjedid, saidPierre Colonna, a Frenchborn doctor who has lived in Algeriasince 1948. &quot;There was a difference of opinion in themilitary on when to stop the {electoral} process. Theyfinally decided they couldn't let {the president} play gameswith the Islamic Front.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
