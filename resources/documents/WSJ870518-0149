We particularly object to your use of the term &quot;Tamil Terror&quot; and the linking of Tamils to Marxists. Instead of relying on Sri Lankan government accounts, you should use independent sources of information. The government attacks on &quot;rebels&quot; have frequently consisted of terror actions against nonpolitical Tamil civilians. The Sri Lankan leaders have been making inflammatory anti-Tamil statements that have gone largely unreported in the Western press. The policy of the current Sinhalese regime has consisted of indiscriminate persecution, torture and murder that have been condemned by Amnesty International.
