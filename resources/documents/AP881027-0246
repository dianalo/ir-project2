(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Great Western Bank, the nation'sthird largest savings and loan, says it wants to leave the troubledfederal system that bails out failed thrifts and to join theinsurance system for commercial banks.   The move would save Great Western at least $27 million a year ininsurance premiums and send a message to Congress that the nation'shealthy thrifts are fed up with paying to rescue faltering, oftenbadly managed Sandamp;Ls, analysts said.   ``This is a very important statement,'' said Peter Treadway, ananalyst for the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham in NewYork. ``This is a signal that Great Western is not going to put upwith any more nonsense and have its net worth stolen without afight.''   Great Western said Wednesday it has applied for permission todrop Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. coverage of depositsin its 263 retail branches in California, Florida and Arizona infavor of insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whichcovers most banks and some thrifts.   At least one other big California thrift, San Diego-based HomeFederal Savings andamp; Loan Association, was considering pulling out ofthe FSLIC, but was prevented from doing so immediately by itscharter.   Most savings institutions are barred by Congress from leaving theFSLIC, although Great Western says it is exempt from that rule.   Great Western's action appeared unlikely to mark the beginning ofa mass exodus from the FSLIC, which faces $50 billion to $100billion in bailout costs. But the move was seen to have greatsymbolic significance as members of Congress are expected thissession to put a high priority on the issue of thrift bailouts.   ``This is sure to get the attention of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard and Congress,'' said Norman Coulson, chief executive ofGlendale Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association. ``Congress has got toaddress this problem sooner or later. They can't continue tappingthe healthy thrifts forever.''   James Montgomery, chairman of parent Great Western FinancialCorp., said the application was made to protect the firm'sstockholders from special insurance levies.   The insurance switch, if approved, wouldn't affect customers oremployees, but would save the parent company and its stockholdersabout $26 million a year in special FSLIC premiums, said spokesmanIan Campbell.   Great Western is among about 40 of the nation's 3,200 Sandamp;Ls thatfiled documents making them eligible for exemptions from the ban ondefections from the FSLIC that was imposed by Congress in August1987 and renewed Aug. 10.   About 10 Sandamp;L's, none of them as large as Great Western, have leftthe FSLIC to be insured by the FDIC while retaining their savingsand loan charters.   What irks healthy thrifts are the high FSLIC premiums they arecharged to offset the losses of a minority troubled thrifts. Thosepremiums run about 2{ times more than those assessed by the FDIC.   Both the FSLIC and the FDIC insure customers accounts up to$100,000. But while the thirft insurer is insolvent, the FDICexpects to have at least $15 billion in reserves by the end of theyear.   Great Western Financial, based in Beverly Hills, is the nation'sNo. 3 thrift holding company with $31 billion in assets and 900offices nationwide. It focuses its business in industry'straditional area of home mortgages, as opposed to aggressive andsometimes shaky thrifts that have made commercial loans.   Great Western said it would accomplish the insurance switch bymerging its California, Florida and Arizona retail operations into asmall thrift subsidiary in Washington state that already has FDICinsurance.   In California, defections from the FSLIC are hampered by statethrift laws, which don't allow state-chartered Sandamp;Ls to carry FDICinsurance.</TEXT></DOC>
