Topicsdiscussed included: (1) General reviews of hydrogen embrittlement andfilm rupture - anodic dissolution mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking,(2) environmental factors involved in PWSCC, (3) the influence of microstructureon PWSCC, and (4) the influence of stress and plastic strain on PWSCC.A significant portion of the discussions of all of these topics was devotedto the subject of modelling of crack initiation and crack growth.</TEXT></DOC>
