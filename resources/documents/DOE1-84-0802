<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-0802 </DOCNO><TEXT>A numerical study is performed on steady natural convection inside a cylindricalenclosure filled with a volumetrically-heated, saturated porous mediumfor the case when the vertical wall is isothermal and the horizontalwalls are either adiabatic or isothermally cooled. When the horizontalwalls are insulated, the flow in the cavity is unicellular and the temperaturefield in upper layers is highly stratified. However, if the top wallis cooled, there may exist a multicellular flow and an unstable thermalstratification in the upper region of the cylinder. Under the influenceof weak convection, the maximum temperature in the cavity can be considerablyhigher than that induced by pure conduction. The local heat flux on thebounding walls is generally a strong function of the Rayleigh number,the aspect ratio and the wall boundary conditions. The heat removal onthe cold upper surface decreases with the aspect ratio thereby increasingthe Nusselt number on the vertical wall. The effect of Rayleigh numberis, however, not straight-forward. Several correlations are presentedfor the maximum cavity temperature and the overall Nusselt number.</TEXT></DOC>
