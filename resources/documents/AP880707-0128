Although the party's platform writers approved a roughly3,500-word draft platform in Denver June 25, they have not yetcompleted the task of polishing the amendments approved at thatmeeting.   The Michael Dukakis campaign is still negotiating with JesseJackson's forces over the civil rights leader's plan to pursue asmany as 13 minority plants at the party's convention in AtlantaJuly 19.   The Jackson campaign was rebuffed at the Denver meeting on suchissues as Jackson's call for higher taxes on the wealthy, aPentagon freeze, a U.S. promise of no-first-use of nuclear weapons,and self-determination for the Palestinians.   Mike Barnes, a former Maryland congressman handling the platformfor the Dukakis campaign, said, ``We are continuing to work withthe committee members and the other campaign trying to resolveoutstanding issues.''   He said ``purely mechanical'' reasons had delayed issuing theamended majority report. ``People were hard to reach during theholiday weekend,'' Barnes explained.   A platform committee official, who asked not to be identified,said the entire report, including the Jackson minority planks, maybe released Monday.   The convention starts July 18 in Atlanta, with the delegatesscheduled to take up the platform the next day.   Jackson controlled more than a quarter of the 186-memberplatform committee, enough to ensure that he can carry any issue hewishes to the floor.</TEXT></DOC>
