The congress called for intensified military action to end theIsraeli occupation of the territories and rejected Israeli PremierYitzhak Shamir's plan for elections.   ``What we are after is freedom, like any other people,'' Sharifsaid. ``We are asking the Israelis to come and sit down and talk tous.''   But he said that as long as Israel occupies the territories thePLO will continue to lead the uprising in the West Bank and GazaStrip. More than 530 Palestinians and 38 Israelis have been killedin the uprising that began in December 1987.   Shamir has proposed elections in the occupied lands and talkswith the elected Palestinian representatives on an interimself-rule solution for the 1.7 million Arabs in the territories.   In Jerusalem, an Israeli government official, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said he saw nothing new in Abu Sharif'sstatement.   He said the PLO's repeated demand for guaranteeing creation of aPalestinian state before any negotiations amounts to rejection ofIsrael's call for talks without conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
