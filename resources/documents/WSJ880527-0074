Samuel, Patlex's chairman. The patent has been upheld twice in federal litigation and in a re-examination proceeding in the U.S. Patent Office, the company said.    Patlex, based in Chatsworth, Calif., makes, markets and licenses lasers and other advanced industrial technologies. The company wants to collect both back royalties and ongoing royalties from the government.    Spokesmen for the Department of Defense declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
