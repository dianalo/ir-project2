The disclosure by Minneapolis-based First Bank, among the 20 biggest bank holding companies, is the latest indication that regional banks are moving rapidly to shrink their Latin American loan portfolios. The trend, which increasingly shows the difference between regional institutions and money center banks, which have more Latin American loans, is expected to accelerate under the proposed Mexican debt plan.    During the last half of 1987, First Bank said, it sold $146 million in Third World loans, taking a charge of $73 million, or 50 cents on the dollar, from reserves it had already set aside. First Bank's Third World loans now total about $317 million, only $53 million of that carried as performing.    First Bank said it added $164 million of Third World loans, mostly to Mexico and Argentina, to its nonperforming loans. It previously had placed about $100 million of loans to Brazil and Ecuador on nonperforming status. All of those loans are non-trade-related. The $53 million still carried as performing are better secured, trade-related loans, mostly to Brazil.    Typically, banks classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days or more past due, and stop accruing interest until it is actually paid. First Bank said that any future payments on the $264 million of nonperforming Latin American loans would be applied to principal, not interest, further indicating a desire to reduce its Latin American loans. That will cut expected 1988 net interest income -- the difference between what a bank collects on loans and pays on deposits -- by about $14 million.    First Bank, as of Dec. 31, had about $145 million of reserves against foreign loans, or about 55% of the Latin American loans now classified as nonperforming.    That level of reserves positions First Bank to bid aggressively for partially U.S.-backed bonds that Mexico would offer under a new debt plan. Under the plan, banks would agree to accept a discount -- many bankers figure as little as 50 cents on the dollar -- in return for Mexican bonds, the principal of which would be guaranteed by U.S. Treasury securities, the interest paid by Mexico.    First Bank wouldn't comment on its interest in the Mexican plan. As previously reported, some regional banks with similar or higher reserve levels have indicated that they will bid aggressively for the Mexican bonds, a move likely to make use of the plan more costly for money center banks that have more Mexican loans and lower reserve levels. </TEXT></DOC>
