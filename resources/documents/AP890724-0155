Foley spoke Mondayagainst lightly and frivolously amending the Constitution to banflag burning.   ``I cannot imagine why anyone in this country, the president oranybody else, should favor amending the Constitution unnecessarilywithout reason if a statute can accomplish all the objectives thatthe president or others seek,'' the Washington Democrat said in hisfirst appearance as House speaker before the National Press Club.   Foley and other Democratic leaders contend it is possible todraft a statute banning flag burning that will meet the standardsof the Supreme Court, which ruled last month in a Texas case thatflag burning was a protected form of free expression.   President Bush and House and Senate Republican leaders arebacking a constitutional amendment, arguing that a statute can'twork.   The issue has raised political tensions in Congress, withDemocratic lawmakers opposed to the amendment worried that the GOPcampaign organization will flog them as less patriotic unless theyvote for it.   ``I think to lightly, frivolously almost, rush forward and amendthe Constitution out of political or partisan or legalistic reasonswhen there is an opportunity to consider a statute ... achievingthe objectives is something that we should all be concernedabout,'' Foley said.   ``The Congress would be wise to draft a statute and see what thecourts do with it,'' he said.   Congress can include with the statute a provision that wouldspeed court review, he said.   The House Judiciary Committee is expected to meet on flaglegislation later this week and Foley said he still intends tobring a statute to the full House before the August recess.   Foley said he might not be able to block a House vote on theconstitutional amemdment, but indicated he'd at least like to letthe Senate act first, which it is now scheduled to do in October.   ``The danger is not only amending the Constitution withoutnecessity, it's lowering the level of resistance in the Congressand the country to amendments to the Constitution and mostparticularly to the First Amendment, which is the basis as we allknow of speech, religious and press liberty,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
