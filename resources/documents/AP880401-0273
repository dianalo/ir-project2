The film, which will be broadcast Wednesday night on most PBSaffiliates, is more dated now than it was last year, when``Frontline'' decided not to air it because parts were obsolete.   At the time Briton Antony Thomas made the film, Jim and TammyBakker ran the fastest-growing television ministry. At the time,Jessica Hahn was not yet a national celebrity.   ``Thy Kingdom Come'' has been updated to mention the uttercollapse of Bakker's empire, but it does not reflect the scandalthat recently hit TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.   The version of ``The Kingdom Come'' made available for reviewwill have to be updated again to amend Thomas' comment that PatRobertson, the former evangelist turned presidential candidate,``seems to be going from strength to strength.''   That was well before the South Carolina primary which Robertsonpromised to win.   After all the developments of the past year, it's also old newsthat TV evangelism is a fund-raising treadmill, begging for moneyto buy television time in order to beg for more money.   The film concentrates on the alliance between variousfundamentalist and pentecostal Christians and the political right,but mostly from the perspective of 1980. Included is a clip ofcandidate Ronald Reagan's ``I endorse you'' speech to a gatheringin Dallas organized by TV evangelist James Robison.   It's now the end of the Reagan era, and Thomas does not addressthe pertinent question: What were the fruits of this alliancebetween a president and the religious right?   Thomas also notes that the religious right supported RepublicanBob Martinez in his candidacy for governor in Florida, but doesn'ttry to assess how important that support was in his victory. Itleaves the impression that it was decisive.   The film slights a point that became evident as the PTL storyunfolded: the religious right is not a monolithic movement. TheRev. Jerry Falwell was rejected by many of Bakker's followers,Bakker feuded with Swaggart, and Swaggart traded insults with OralRoberts.   ``Thy Kingdom Come'' avoids total obsolescence through Thomas'sympathetic interviews with a few grass-roots believers: one aformer alcoholic, another a victim of child abuse and rape, a womanwho says she was addicted to drugs for 20 years, and a man who feltempty despite material success.   ``Before I met Jesus I felt empty, I felt hurt and lost,'' saysthe rape victim. ``He's healed me of hatred and bitterness I'vecarried for 35 years.''   ``Thy Kingdom Come'' is paired with ``Thy Will Be Done,'' a filmabout the First Baptist Church of Dallas and its minister, the Rev.W.A. Criswell, a leader of the dominant fundamentalist wing in theSouthern Baptist Convention.   Here, Thomas takes on the issue of the relationship betweenreligion and wealth. He is candid about his own belief that thegospels are on the side of the poor, and that Jesus meant what hesaid when he talked of the unlikelihood of the rich getting toheaven.</TEXT><TEXT>   MOST PLEDGES _ PBS stations are celebrating their best month offundraising.
