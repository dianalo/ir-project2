Philips, along with new partner Nintendo of America Inc.,and Sony shook up executives attending the Summer ConsumerElectronics Show as they tried to outdo each other and setnew directions for the $6 billion video-game market.</LP><TEXT>   Sony, which brought the world the Walkman and an array ofother electronic gadgets, went first, announcing Friday itwould take its first plunge into the home video games with asystem called Play Station. The system will use compact diskcomputer technology, on what Sony called a super disc, thatshould give its video games high-quality sound and imagesthat outclass today's video games, like those from Nintendo.   Philips and Nintendo played their hand on Saturday,stunning show attendees with news that the two companies willdevelop a sophisticated compact-disk player that can behooked up to Nintendo's newest videogame machine, the SuperNintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo also will develop newcompact disk-based video games for the Philips-Nintendosystem.   The Philips-Nintendo tie surprised executives at Sony,which also had been working with Nintendo on video games forSony's newly announced compact-disk system. Nintendo informedSony executives of the Philips deal only 48 hours before itsannouncement.   And although all three companies have worked together ondeveloping several electronics formats -- Sony and Philipscooperated on the compact disk interactive standard, andNintendo had worked on separate video-game standards witheach big company -- all three systems are incompatible. Thatcould end up confusing customers and retailers alike and mayhinder the market's growth early on.   The announcements have industry executives girding for anintense video war similar to that of a decade ago. Thevideo-game business, which the Nintendo system has dominatedfor five years, is expected to be splintered permanently.   &quot;It will be fierce competition,&quot; says the executive of alarge consumer electronics company. &quot;Is it good for anyone? Idoubt it. It will confuse customers and it's a headache forretailers.&quot;   Both Sony and Nintendo say their machines will reachstores within 18 months, after which executives here expectcustomer confusion and intense price-cutting. Once in stores,the Sony and Nintendo systems will have to contend withcompanies such as NEC Technologies Inc., whose TurboGraxsystem has had a CD attachment available since 1989, andwhose disks also aren't compatible with any other player.   What's more, any new CD video game will be going upagainst a huge installed base of video game players fromNintendo, as well as Sega's Genesis machine and other videogame systems. Nintendo is clearly the leader, selling in thepast five years 28 million original Nintendo systems and 160million game cartridges. But at the show here, Nintendo tookthe wraps off its new Super Nintendo system, which at $199 istwice the cost of the original system and won't be able toplay the old game cartridges. The original Nintendo uses8-bit technology that processes computer instruction inchunks of eight bits at a time; the new Super systemprocesses data 16 bits at a time.   &quot;Each generation has a dominant player,&quot; says Kenneth R.Wirt, a vice president of NEC. &quot;Now it's a generation ofgames with 16-bit technology and CDs sneaking in. It will bea battle to see who dominates this generation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
