There a scan disclosed a long-hidden ailment: calcified arteries from his pelvis to his ankles, a telltale pattern suggestive of diabetes.    He was beyond cure, however. An Egyptian mummy known as Nes-Ptah (pronounced ness-TAH), the Barber of Amun, he had died in his 60s in about 950 B.C. He was scanned some 3,000 years later, then was returned to his resting place at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.    Nes-Ptah, his wife and 13 other mummies made the same round trip. Along with pictures of their scans, they will star in an exhibit at the museum next fall called &quot;Mummies and Magic: Funerary Arts of Ancient Egypt.&quot;    At one time, scholars would unwrap mummies and perform an autopsy on their crumbling forms. &quot;The trouble is, once you unwrap a mummy, you can't put it back together,&quot; says Sue D'Auria, an Egyptologist at the museum. &quot;The linen wrappings just disintegrate.&quot; But this is a new era in medical archaeology.    Today scholars can peer and gently probe -- without ever unwinding the shroud -- by using CT (computed tomography) scanners. The scanners take crosssectional views like slices from a loaf of bread, which computers reconstruct as a three-dimensional image of the mummy inside. &quot;Mummies were destroyed wholesale, but this project is noninvasive and nondestructive,&quot; says Myron Marx, a radiologist at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco who is Ms. D'Auria's collaborator. &quot;It ensures their preservation.&quot;    Of course, mummies can be X-rayed, too -- these same mummies were X-rayed in the 1930s -- but that works well only for viewing bones. CT scans give sharper images of soft tissue. &quot;We can diagnose disease, because mummies aren't just bones; they're skin, muscles and nerves,&quot; says Dr. Marx. But he adds, &quot;We don't want to open and touch them. To open would be to change what's there.&quot;    Mummies have long been probed and plundered. Once in plentiful supply, their numbers have waned because of the predations of collectors and grave robbers. They were pulverized for medicine and dye in the Middle Ages. Later they were burned as railroad fuel and plowed under as fertilizer. They were unwound for thrills as a Victorian parlor entertainment, and then discarded.    When they were alive, these ancient Egyptians were subject to most of the same diseases and injuries that plague modern man. Dr. Marx diagnosed several small tumors among the 15 mummies, including a benign but probably painful spinal growth that today would be removed surgically. Another mummy had a fractured right forearm, &quot;perhaps from warding off a blow,&quot; Dr. Marx speculates. &quot;It healed in near-normal alignment,&quot; he says, &quot;suggesting that it had been set.&quot;    A poignant sign of mortality shows in the mummy of a young boy who died during the Roman occupation of Egypt. His bones show what doctors call &quot;growth arrest lines,&quot; like rings on a tree trunk, depicting disruption of normal growth by disease. The rings start out widely spaced, growing closer and closer together as his disease recurred -- until his growth stopped forever at about age 10.    A mummy's age at death can only be approximated. The coffin inscriptions are discreetly silent. But Egyptian bread provides a clue. It was baked from grain milled with sand, and the residual grit wore down teeth. So the shorter the teeth, the older the mummy. Spinal degeneration also helps fix the age of death.    Precise causes of death also are elusive. One good reason: Except for the heart, the internal organs of those being mummified were removed, dried out, wrapped in linen and then either put back where they were in the body or placed in jars elsewhere in the tomb. This mummifying of the organs so altered them that not much can be learned from them.    Still, signs of disease abound. &quot;We've seen gallstones, bladder stones, tumors and parasites,&quot; says Dr. Marx, along with rampant dental disease and jaw abscesses. &quot;I've diagnosed diabetes, hardening of the arteries and a small brain tumor. It's fun to speculate (about the cause of death), but you have to label it as such.&quot;    One mummy's death remains more a mystery than most. Her name was Tabes (pronounced tah-BESS), Songstress of Amun. The wellborn wife of Nes-Ptah -- the 60-ish barber with bad arteries -- she died in her early 30s, but her body bears no sign of injury or illness. Perhaps the answer lies in one of the organs that were mummified and put back into her body.    Three millenniums after Tabes's death, Dr. Marx electronically unveils her face and sees the singer's lips and throat. He switches slides and begins scanning her torso, its belly, breasts and ribs wizened but intact. He points to a dot on her abdomen and exclaims, &quot;There's a 3,000-year-old bellybutton.&quot;    Tabes appears to have been &quot;carelessly mummified,&quot; Ms. D'Auria says. The embalmer's incision was left gaping and her body left devoid of preservative resins, unlike her well-embalmed husband. Such differences stump the scholars. &quot;They could be regional or chronological -- if they died in different places or times,&quot; Ms. D'Auria says. &quot;We just don't know.&quot;    Mummification -- basically, drying out and anointing -- took months but lasts for thousands of years. The removed internal organs were dried in natron, a substance similar to baking soda. The body was bathed in oils and spices, then adorned with funeral jewelry: amulets to guide it to the Underworld, and a heart scarab &quot;to keep the heart from testifying against its owner on Judgment Day,&quot; Dr. Marx says. After being wrapped in a linen shroud, the body was placed in a painted cartonnage, or mummy case. The cartonnage was placed in a wooden coffin, and the coffin was placed in a stone sarcophagus.    Such funereal splendor wasn't for the poor. &quot;Most of these people belonged to the priestly class,&quot; says Ms. D'Auria. &quot;Those whose bodies survived were those who could afford to pay for it.&quot;    The decoration of the coffin advertised an extension of the good life into eternity. &quot;One man's painted coffin lid shows legs of beef, scallions -- because Egyptians loved onions -- along with chickens, freshly slaughtered, and beer and wine of known vintages,&quot; says Dr. Marx admiringly.    Egyptians wanted not only to live well but also to look good in the afterlife. Dr. Marx's CT scans clearly depict the mummies' cosmetic rituals. Beeswax -- identified by its density -- was poured into the mummy's mouth and neck to give a fuller, more vital appearance, much as modern women and men take collagen injections to plump up their lips and cheeks. Eyes were filled with wax or resin and capped with magic amulets to adorn and symbolically restore sight.    All these baubles, designed to preserve and protect, also lured grave robbers, who literally broke bodies apart in their gold lust. Some of Dr. Marx's pictures show necks fractured and cervical vertebrae yanked out of alignment by robbers tearing off a necklace. &quot;Here's a mummy with a V-shaped stab wound,&quot; he points out. &quot;Grave robbers would slash through shrouds, rip off jewelry and run. Many mummies don't have necks or arms&quot; at all. Some Egyptian papyri show trials of tomb makers charged with grave robbing.    Dr. Marx fell under the spell of mummies as a young boy visiting the British Museum. Today, he says, &quot;there's a real sense of intimacy with these people&quot; thanks to the combination of ancient embalming and modern scanning. </TEXT></DOC>
