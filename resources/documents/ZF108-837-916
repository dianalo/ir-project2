[or] laser printers.andP;  Gradually people started saying, 'Gee, Ican send a message to someone on the screen.'andM;Local area networks have made a major revolution over the last seven or eightyears.andP;  I would argue that most LANs I see, at least in large organizations,have really become primarily communications networks.andP;  Sharing peripheralsand hard disks was the era of the workgroup LAN.andP;  Now I think we're really inthe era of the enterprise LAN.andM;Next we'll see LANs being recognized as a communication system, not just away of tying PCs together.andP;  And it may seem like a subtle distinction, but itreally isn't because a lot of people still would say, a PC, typewriter, bigdeal.andP;  As a communication system, it has exactly the same kind of importancein organizational structure as the phone system.andP;  If the phone system goesdown, unless they happen to be blessed with a pneumatic tube system, andthere aren't many modern organizations that are, you're out of luck.andP;  Yourorganization doesn't work.andM;If you sell LANs as communications system, then centralized management ofthese resources becomes absolutely essential because the enterprise networkis a mission-critical application.andP;  It's not something that can be left tothe vagaries of the PC hotshot over in building C whom you call and who showsup two or three days later.andP;  You can't afford to have your network go downanymore.andP;  So centralized management of networks is really going to become themajor theme of the 1990s.andM;LAN: Do you think Token Ring is better suited for centralized networkmanagement than Ethernet or Arcnet?andM;Mick:  I think Token Ring is definitely [better] than Arcnet and, right atthe momentM than Ethernet,  It could be that Ethernet will have a chance tocatch up a little bit.andP;  [Recently] IBM and 3Com made an announcement thatthey are going to build a network managementandM;system for Ethernet.andP;   They are going toandM;take OSI's network-management structure and try to figure out a commoninterface.andP;  The common interface is LLC Type 2.andP;  To have management at thatlevel would be an incredibly powerful tool.andM;[With Token Ring,] from a central location you can take anybody out of thering, given the right software.andP;  You've got all these MAC [Media AccessControl] frames telling you what's going on, and if you've got a program thatreads them, you can really figure it out.andM;The stations actually manage themselves.andP;  If there's a problem with the TokenRing station, it will try to fix itself.andP;  If it can't, it will de-insert outof the ring, so the ring continues.andM;In Ethernet, if you start having trouble with a station, you start at one endand you go down T-connector by T-connector, and that's a terrible thing todo.andP;  It's one thing if you've got a 25-node local LAN.andP;  But as soon as youstart tying those suckers together across bridges and routers, between floorsand buildings, or even worse, campuswide, that's just impossible to do.andP;  InEthernet, the network is essentially only as strong as the weakest link, andthe weakest link is the terminator on either end or the T-connector that goesin the back of every card.andP;  That's an awful thing to maintain, because mostpeople dont't have the reverence for tight-fitting T-connectors that LANfreaks do.andP;  Token Ring takes care of all that.andP;  That is a really powerfulblessing.andM;The goal is to have [management] require very, very small RAM kernels, soit's something that might stay resident in individual machines.andP;  The othercentralized management structures we've seen normally are based on SNMP, andthat just eats up too much RAM.andP;  SNMP can go down as far as a bridge.andP;  Ifyou're SynOptics, it could go down as far as one of those nice big cabinetsSynOptics sells, which will allow you to control down to the node level ifyou don't want to buy SynOptics' solution, you're pretty much stuck with onlybeing able to manage as far as the bridge or the router, and that's just notenough.andM;From a management structure, Token Ring, right at the moment, has it all overEthernet.andP;  I think that 10BaseT, with its notion of hubs, will help.andP;  As Iunderstand the 10BaseT standard, you've got the notion of activeconcentrators that can be managed.andP;  But those have to be managed by anexternal source.andP;  You're going to have to build on another layer to handlethat.andP;  If you're going to do that, either you're going to have proprietarysolutions, which is what you've got now, or you'll have something like anOpen 10BaseT Foundation that's going to have to try and coordinate.andM;LAN: What do you see as the OTF's main role?andM;Mick: One of the best things we provide is a neutral place where people cantalk about these problems.andP;  I'm a central node in the network, wheredifferent vendors can talk to us about these things and we can figure out howmuch you can say to somebody else and filter out the part that the other guysdon't need to know.andM;There's a lot of information floating around, but there's isn't muchinformation that's in the right place to get what you want.andP;  That didn'texist in Ethernet.andP;  It wasn't needed in Ethernet because there wasn't theneed for commonality of solution, because there was so much lessfunctionality provided.andP;  There are no parameters to argue about,manufacturer-to-manufacturer.andP;  The standard says, 'Here's what the bandwidthis, what the signal is going to look like on the wire, and the protocol forthe packet.'andP;  There's nothing left to jiggle in Ethernet that these guys canwork with, or at least, that they're willing to work with.andM;That's not the case in Token Ring.andP;  If you look in a Token Ring packet,there's a whole mess of bits that IEEE has said are available for networkmanagement.andP;  They haven't said, 'When this bit's zero, it means this, andwhen this bit's one, it m eans that.'andP;  I've heard the number 47 bandiedaround.andP;  And if there are 47 of th ose, then [2.sup.47] means a lot ofoptions somehow have got to get coordinated across vendors.andM;LAN: Are any vendors already using those bits in propriety managementsolutions?andM;Mick: I don't think they are yet.andP;  The potential exists for them to do that.andO;That potential isn't in Ethernet because it isn't in the packet.andM;They are different approaches to the same problem.andP;  If you went back toThomas Kuhn, in the STructure of Scientific Revolutions, he says you startwith a nice theory that explains everything, and then it doesn't, so you add'except in this case you do this,' and the next thing you know, you have thisnice clean little paradigm but it's got all these caveats tacked on.andP;  Then weget a major scientific genius who says, 'We don't need all that stuff.andO;Here's this new, simple paradigm that explains all of those &quot;buts.&quot;'andM;Token Ring does that to a certain extent.andP;  It takes a lot of the stuff thatwas tacked onto Ethernet to make it a viable solution in an enterprisesituation, and puts it all in one.andP;  It's not to say that it's the best one,but at least it's a different one, and sort of a simpler one, if youunderstand it.andM;LAN: The OTF's literature says you are now promoting the interoperability ofFDDI.andP;  Is the OTF as active in FDDI standards as in the 802.5 committee?andM;Mick: I haven't been, because there are more structures there.andP;  OTF isn't theonly one out there.andP;  I think FDDI is a little less ready to come all the wayto market.andP;  There is the Advanced Networking Group that AMD [Advanced MicroDevices] set up, which is company-specific, even though there is a roadmembership.andP;  I maintain contact with them.andM;The University of New Hampshire set up the interoperability Lab, which isdefined mostly as taking their engineering and science building and pulling62-micron fiber cable.andP;  They're trying to build a consortium to talk aboutinteroperability.andM;I'm trying to figure out what to do and how much effort can be investedwithin the OTF.andP;  We [exhausted our resources] demonstrating thatinteroperability exists on 4Mbps cards [at Networld Dallas in 1989].andP;  Ournext major issue will be to start talking about the interoperability of16Mbps Token Ring.andP;  We've been quiescent for a quite while now, waiting forthe 16Mbps market to develop.andM;Once you've done the interoperability demo like we did last year at Networld,there's just not a whole lot els we can do.andP;  You could go to greater andgreater lengths.andP;  You can have organizations that can spend a lot of timejustifying their existence, but I don't think that's what OTF should do.andP;  OTFis primarily a forum for manufacturers and vendors and users to get togetherto talk about these issues.andP;  It ought to be issue-based.andM;Designing InteroperabilityandM;LAN: Bob Metcalfe was the driving force in founding the OTF.andP;  Does he or 3Comcontinue to play an active role in the OTF?andM;Mick: No.andP;  3Com pulled out of Token Ring.andP;  3Com had mixed emotions aboutToken Ring.andP;  On the one hand, Metcalfe founded the firm, and it clearly is afirm built on Ethernet.andP;  Most of their successes were with Ethernet, and theymoved into Token Ring early, saying it offered some management sophisticationthat Ethernet didn't.andP;  One of the decisions they made strategically was topull back from Token Ring and focus on their strength, which was Ethernet,and to start to build extensions to 10BaseT.andM;One of the things they asked was the difference between Token and 10BaseT.andO;And their answer was very simplistic: 'Gee, they're really about the same.'andM;I don't think that's it, because a lot of the management issues aresoftware-oriented, and 10BaseT falls considerably short there.andP;  3Com isstarting to remedy that with this alliance with IBM to develop a standard toallow some Token Ring-like management capability with Ethernet.andP;  They'retalking about developing a standard for how such a product might exist.andM;There will be the same issue that Token Ring has--there's a big differencebetween a standard and the implementation of a standard.andP;  The standard tellsyou what you have to design to, but it mostly defines outputs.andP;  It doesn'tdefine internal processes.andP;  Those internal processes are really the key todetermining the outputs.andP;  If you don't have some organization that can helpgo behind the outputs, as the sophistication of your system increases, thedanger of noninteroperability increases.andM;We make a big thing of the differences between compliance, conformance, andinteroperability.andP;  Conformance isn't necessarily a condition forinteroperability.andP;  The standard makes it a lot nicer and easier to develop aninteroperable product, but conformance to a standard doesn't mean productsare interoperable.andM;It's possible to design your implementation in a number of different ways.andO;It's quite difficult to ensure interoperability.andP;  On the other hand, thingscan be interoperable and not conformance-standard.andM;The proper standard is something that's fixed.andP;  It may evolve, but theevolution is done in an agreed-upon way.andP;  Interoperability is driven verymuch by the technology limitations of the products.andM;Designing interoperability is a scary thing.andP;  It's very important to havesome dynamic consensus system built in.andP;  For example, when I sat in on someof these initial discussions of interoperability testing for the AdvancedNetworking Group, the defined interoperability testing as opening their lab,and building an FDDI network, and the first FDDI network they built was withAMD's products.andM;So interoperability would be defined as your product working with theirproduct.andP;  So you're interoperable.andP;  Then [another vendor] brings its productin, and its product is tested against AMD's and [the first vendor's], and ifit works, you're interoperable.andP;  But suppose it doesn't work.andP;  Who's atfault?andM;You can make interoperability become a gradually diminishing set offunctions, or you can have some kind of mechanism which will say, 'Okay,here's your problem, how are we going to deal with it?'andP;  The standards groupsdo that at more of a theoretical level than at a practical level.andP;  A grouplike OTF or the Advanced Networing Group does it at an operational level.andM;LAN: How does the OTF encourage interoperability among the products or itsmembers?andM;Mick: By acting as a clearing-house, getting people to talk about things, bytesting, for example.andP;  I'll normally encourage [a vendor] to test when I seethere's a problem.andM;Most Active NonmemberandM;LAN: IBM is not a member of the OTF.andP;  Have you had any kind of communicationwith them?andM;Mick: I have a joke with Bill Selden and John MacElroy that IBM is our mostactive nonmember.andP;  May understanding of what they would say is, 'We thinkinteroperability is a good thing, and we're willing to support activitiesthat promote interoperability.andP;  We're not sure on a long-term basis that OTFis the right way to do it.andP;  So we aren't so sure we want to join yet.andP;  Butthere's a difference between the organization and its activities.andP;  If we wantto participate in the activities, we're kind of leaving the door open on theorganization.'andP;  They've never said they'll never join, only that they're notready to join.andM;LAN: Could you explain how IBM participates as if it were a member withoutactually having joined?andM;Mick: We invited them to participate.andP;  They volunteered to send an engineerto help me set up [the Networld demonstration], which, in retrospect, Iprobably should have accepted.andM;IBM showed up in advance.andP;  They came over the day we were setting up, threepeople came over and said, 'What can we do to help?'andP;  They had practicallytheir senior Token Ring design guy there with us.andP;  They staffed the booth thewhole time.andM;LAN: Does IBM seem to be willing to move into interoperability?andP;  They're nottaking the standpoint that they're No.andP;  1 in Token Ring and don't have towork with other vendors?andM;Mick: Yeah.andP;  We did a forum in January where we talked mostly about bridging,and in particular about Token Ring.andP;  And IBM did a presentation.andP;  That kindof interaction is something very difficult for them to do.andM;You get some of that in an OTF or IEEE meeting, but it's at a whole differentlevel.andP;  There you're in those rarefied metalevels of talking about how manyDBs of attenuation on the signal under the following circumstances.andP;  Really,you're talking about engineering-type camaraderie.andM;The kind of thing you see in the OTF is probably less engineering and moreproduct-manager camaraderie about how your product works, how itinteroperates with this product, what it does that makes it easier or moredifficult for other people to work with it.andP;  There isn't any other place thatkind of discussion takes place.andM;We'll have to see some of this in 10BaseT, because they're starting to talkabout some fairly interesting things.andP;  The wiring hubs are smart and active.andO;I would assume that it's going to be interesting when you start lookingacross manufacturers.andM;I don't know of many people who are talking about interoperability.andP;  Maybethe biggest part of the problem was that the Open Token Foundation shouldhave been the Open Networking Foundation.andM;Driving FasterandM;LAN: Toshiba, Western Digital, Chips andamp; Technology, and others have beenhinting that they will have a Token Ring chipset.andP;  How do you think multiplechipsets will affect interoperability?andM;Mick: It will make things real exciting.andP;  I'd talk about interoperability attwo levels.andP;  I'd talk about the analog interoperability and digitalinteroperability.andP;  And maybe I'd talk about software.andM;I think interoperability will be more difficult.andP;  We've got a lot ofinteroperability issues now getting raised that we're going to have to dealwith.andP;  [Getting it] properly assembled into a packet to put out on the wire,as an interoperability issue, won't be much of an issue.andP;  Granted, the wayyou use those network management bits is something that will harness that.andO;On the other hand, that's the price you pay for having the power.andM;I'd be more concerned with, after you get that packet in the buffer, whatit's going to look like when you tack it onto that token and get it going outon the network.andM;I think LLC Type 2 is going to become mandatory.andP;  IT's not mandatory nowbecause Novell doesn't use it.andP;  And I don't think what I see in LLC Type 2adds that much more overhead.andP;  IT's a really nice, clean way to ensuredeliverability.andP;  I'd like to see that in Token Ring applications, and I thinkthat if Novell were smart, they'd build their driver on top of LLC Type 2,rather than drop it down [directly to the physical layer].andM;Everybody is talking about making a uniform interface.andP;  Not having one inEthernet is a real frustration, becaus it doesn't allow you to do things.andP;  IFyou had a standardized interface between the card and the drivers, then thecard manufacturers would do the part that they do best, and the other companywould do that part that they do best.andP;  Right now, the way these things aredone is a disaster.andM;If we can clean some of this up, and we can say some of this ought to be doneby the card manufacturer and some of it ought to be done by Novell, we canparcel it out so that everybody does the part he does best and we cansignificantly improve performance.andM;LAN: Is cleaning up drivers one of the things that the OTF is trying topromote and encourage?andM;Mick: I'd say that not so much the OTF, but Lanquest.andP;  If you were looking atperformance issues, given what we've got to work with, drivers are the mainthing.andP;  No matter what you do, when you look at performance in a networksetting, unless you're using a Seagate ST-225 or something older, almostevery performance difference you see will be masked by river inefficiencies.andM;LAN: Are LAN Manager and LAN Server better tuned for Token Ring than othernetwork operating systems?andM;Mick: They could be.andP;  Ther's a lot of potential there, and I don't think ithas been utilized yet.andM;Part of the problem is that we need to have a level of user sophisticationthat we don't have.andP;  Everybody is desperately interested in making sure itworks.andP;  They don't have the luxury of being able to go back and say, 'Nowthat it works, what can I do to make this not just a solution, but an elegantsolution?'andP;  We don't really have elegant LANs out there.andP;  We need to get tothe point that a functioning LAN is a given.andP;  And then we can start to workon elegance.andM;LN: You have a lot of expertise at your disposal at Lanquest that manycompanies just don't have.andP;  Doesn't this help significantly?andM;Mick: It isn't all expertise.andP;  It's almost like going through a craftsman'ssystem.andP;  You start with apprentices, and then you get to be journeymen.andP;  Youstart to understand the rules of thumb.andP;  The first thing you understand issurvival, and that's the apprentice And you get to the jorneyman, and youunderstand the rules.andP;  And then beyond that, you get to elegance.andM;That's why benchmark testing and getting people together to talk about[drivers and benchmarks] is important.andP;  Hopefully, in the '90s, we'll getinto the area where we'll have some master craftsmen in the network business.andM;I think the message that we're trying to get out is that this is the way tomake a lot of this stuff more efficient.andP;  The really frustrating thing isthat nothing ever moves as fast as you want it to.andM;It's terribly frustrating, particularly if you're trying to sell elegantthings and people are only worried about survival.andP;  You want them to buyelegant things.andP;  You can't just reduce the price, because they don'tunderstand what elegance means yet.andM;You can either descend and sell survival or you've got to bring them up to where you want to go.andP;  And so what you really become is a proselytizer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
