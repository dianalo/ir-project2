The one-hour documentary, shot in Kenya and Zimbabwe last year,airs Sunday on SuperStation TBS. It is narrated by Richard Kileyand features music by Ladysmith Black Mombazo.   Cayford has serious reasons for doing rhino PR. Of the more than30 species of rhinoceros that once existed on the Africancontinent, only five remain, and all are endangered, especially theblack rhino. In the early 1970s, there were 65,000 rhinos inAfrica. Now there are 4,500.   Says a park ranger in Zimbabwe, ``You do not want to show toyour children one day how an elephant or a rhino look in astorybook.''   ``Ironically,'' notes Cayford in the film's narration, ``thevery feature that evolved for the animal's defense may bring aboutits extinction.''   Poachers are killing rhinos for the horn. A rhino's horn iscaratin, like a human fingernail. The easiest way to remove it isto kill the animal.   Contrary to popular belief, rhino horn powder is not primarilysought as an aphrodisiac, but rather in the Far East as a supposedfever reducer.   More recently, however, conservationists uncovered an alarmingnew market for much of the rhino horn _ North Yemen, whererhino-horn dagger handles are symbols of virility that command upto $15,000. In the oil-rich country, there is plenty of money forsuch extravangances.   In Africa, the battle to save the rhino has in fact become awar, complete with soldiers, helicopters, guns and death. Theenemies, notes Cayford, are ``greed, corruption and ignorance.''   In Zimbabwe, where armed poachers moved after virtually wipingout the rhinos in eastern Africa, the government has given parkrangers authority to shoot to kill poachers. Cayford's camerascapture the rangers' exhilaration after a violent confrontation. Adead poacher is juxtaposed with grim eloquence against the carcassof a rhino.   Since 1985, more than 30 poachers have died. So have 330 rhinos.The rangers say they don't like to kill humans to save animals, butfeel the decision is a moral one. The poachers are on the short endof the economic stick. They risk their lives for a few hundreddollars. The middlemen who smuggle the horns out of Africa makethousands.   Cayford says that despite their frightening appearance, rhinosare peaceful beings. Nevertheless, the filmmakers are seen rapidlyretreating when one trots toward them.   Cayford knows humans can't resist baby animals, even rhinos. Onebaby who was savaged by lions is seen on a preserve for orphanedand injured animals, trotting about with his loyal new friend, aspritely sheep.   ``He was sweet,'' said Cayford. ``I saw him a couple of monthsago, and he's doing fine.''   For conservationists, it is an uphill battle to convinceAfricans who are struggling to develop their countries that savingwildlife should be a priority. Africans themselves are beginning totake up the cause. Michael Werikhe of Kenya walks across hiscountry promoting wildlife conservation. ``It's time wildlifeawareness was taken to the people,'' he says. ``It's them who havethe final say.''   ``There is concern, sure there's concern,'' Cayford said. ``Itjust takes time. At the time people were wiping out the bison,nobody cared very much.   ``What you have to do is come to the country understanding thecountry's problems, and helping rather than preaching,'' he said.``You show them how wildlife has an economic value, that if youlook after wildlife by doing this, this and this, it's going tobring you a natural benefit, that it's not something just topreserve for its own sake, which is a nice idea, but it only workswhen you can afford it.''   At the conclusion of the film, the camera pans from a rhinostanding majestically on a ridge to the tall fence that he faces.   If the rhino war is lost by the conservationists, the narrationsays, ``the rhino will be doomed to exist in a child's picture bookof things that once were, but are no more.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in televsion:</TEXT><TEXT>   POWERS PLAYS MARKHAM _ Stefanie Powers will portray aviatrixBeryl Markham in a two-part, four-hour CBS miniseries ``A Shadow onthe Sun,'' now in production in Kenya.
