RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today let stand a decisiongenerally barring foreign car manufacturers from forcing franchisedU.S. dealers to buy replacement parts exclusively from them.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Mercedes-Benzof North America Inc. that had been supported by other foreign anddomestic car makers.   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September thatMercedes violated antitrust restrictions on tie-in arrangements byrequiring franchised dealers to use ``genuine Mercedes-Benz parts''when servicing customers' cars.   The appeals court rejected Mercedes' argument that a 1936Supreme Court ruling granted car manufacturers an exemption fromantitrust enforcement for tie-in arrangements.   The appeals court also ordered a new trial to determine how muchmoney Mercedes must pay in damages to Metrix Warehouse Inc., anindependent auto parts distributor.   A federal jury had ordered Mercedes to pay Metrix $7 million indamages. The figure was based on $2.3 million in losses Metrix saidit suffered from 1977 through 1983, with the figure tripled under aprovision of antitrust law.   A judge overturned the jury award on grounds some of the moneyMetrix claimed it lost may have been the result of lawfulcompetition and not illegal tie-in arrangements.   Mercedes, which sold some 90,000 cars in the United States in1987, said its 1 percent share of the U.S. market depends onguarantees of high quality.   Requiring franchised dealers to buy parts from the manufactureris essential to assuring that quality, Mercedes said.   The 4th Circuit court said many of the parts sold by Metrix weremade by the same companies that supplied Mercedes. Metrix also saidmost of the parts were non-warranty, quick-turnover items such asfilters, plugs, hoses and belts.   But Mercedes said it conducted random testing of the parts toassure they were not defective, and Metrix did not test theproducts.   Mercedes said to maintain the goodwill of its customers it mustassure ``meticulous supervison of the products, components andservices offered by its franchised dealers.''   The 4th Circuit court said Mercedes could offer such assuranceby less restrictive means than tie-in arrangements.   For example, the appeals court said, Mercedes could requiredealers to tell customers the origin of replacement parts, andcould require that any parts sold by dealers meet certainspecifications.   The appeals court also rejected a counterclaim by Mercedes thatMetrix illegally offered incentives to dealers to induce them topurchase replacement parts from Metrix.   Automobile Importers of America Inc., representing foreign carmanufacturers, and Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of theUnited States Inc., representing domestic producers, supported theMercedes appeal.   The case is Mercedes-Benz vs. Metrix, 87-1560.</TEXT></DOC>
