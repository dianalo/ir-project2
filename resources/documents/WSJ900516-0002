In documents and sworn testimony, government agentsalleged that Mr. Guerin, along with a group of associates,used a host of phony front companies, fraudulent profitreports and 39 bank accounts in Switzerland and the U.S. tocarry out their scheme over a 12-year period.</LP><TEXT>   In Philadelphia federal court, Amy Zelnik, an InternalRevenue Service agent, said Mr. Guerin &quot;directed&quot; the schemethat defrauded a large British defense electronics company,Ferranti International PLC, and forced it last year to writeoff $365 million, or almost half its net worth.   Mr. Guerin, who was profiled in a front page Wall StreetJournal story in January, hasn't been formally charged andhas denied violating any law. But he has been discussing aplea bargain with federal prosecutors, according to peoplefamiliar with the talks. Moreover, one of the companies hecontrolled, Parent Industries Inc., agreed to plead guilty toa federal racketeering charge and agreed to pay thegovernment $4.4 million. Mr. Guerin's attorney, Joseph Tateof Philadelphia, couldn't be reached for comment.   Mr. Guerin has been under investigation by prosecutors anda task force of investigators for more than two years. Thecourt testimony and filings mark the first time that thegovernment laid out some of the evidence it has accumulatedagaint Mr. Guerin, once a revered figure in Lancaster, Pa.   Mr. Guerin built a backyard business, International Signalandamp; Control, into a global conglomerate. His troubles, however,surfaced after he sold International Signal to Ferranti in1988 and internal auditors began questioning the legitimacyof some of his largest contracts.   Federal prosecutors and agents charged that Mr. Guerin andthe other alleged conspirators concocted contracts withPakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and various South Africancustomers.   In an affidavit, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agentalleged that Mr. Guerin and his associates hid their actionsthrough a maze of bank accounts and phony customers beforeand after the sale to Ferranti. The affidavit indicated thatthe government had obtained the cooperation of Mr. Guerin'sformer chief financial officer, Robert Shireman.   &quot;The losses to victims of the fraud are extensive,&quot; theFBI affidavit said. Moreover, a federal prosecutor, RobertGoldman, said after yesterday's hearing that the evidencepresented to the court showed that stockholders ofInternational Signal and later Ferranti were defrauded. Headded that Ferranti, primary victim of the scheme, relied on&quot;fictitious&quot; financial statements in acquiring InternationalSignal.   Ferranti has filed civil suits againt Mr. Guerin andothers seeking $600 million in damages, according to thegovernment.   In painting a picture of intrigue inside Mr. Guerin'scorporate empire, the government indicated that Mr. Guerin'sformer general counsel, William Clark, had threatened todisclose his superior's questionable activities. Prosecutorswent into court to block Mr. Clark's efforts to obtain a $2million severance payment from Mr. Guerin. The governmentalleged that Mr. Clark used &quot;blackmail&quot; to obtain theagreement. Mr. Clark, who has previously denied actingillegally, declined to comment.   The government didn't provide any details on one importantfacet of its inquiry: allegations that Mr. Guerin smugglednavigational technology for fighter planes and electronicsparts to South Africa, where he began doing business in the1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
