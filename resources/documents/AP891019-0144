Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said as theSenate defeated the amendment, ``We do not serve our nationaltradition by forcing Americans to make a false and unnecessarychoice between the flag and the Constitution.''   However, Republican leader Bob Dole said, ``I think the flagshould be flown at half-staff after this vote.''   The White House said Bush was ``disappointed'' at the Senate'saction.   The proposal won a slight majority, 51-48, but that was 15 votesshort of the two-thirds of senators present and voting that wasneeded for approval.   Democrats led the opposition, but the vote was hardly alongstrict party lines. Thirty-three Republicans and 18 Democrats votedfor the measure, while 11 Republicans and 37 Democrats opposed it.   Congress gave final passage last week to a bill to ban flagburning by simple statute.   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said after Thursday's votethat Bush continued to believe that a constitutional amendmentoffered ``the only ... real protection for the flag'' and that thelaw, which he will allow to take effect without his signature,``would not survive constitutional scrutiny.''   He had called for the constitutional amendment in June after theSupreme Court threw out the conviction of Texas flag burner GregoryLee Johnson on grounds that a Texas flag-burning law violated hisconstitutional right of freedom of speech.   Arguing broke out between the parties even after the vote asDemocrats charged that Bush and GOP National Chairman Lee Atwaterhad pushed the amendment to put pressure on them. ``He has used hishigh office for a low purpose,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,said of Bush.   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted that 18 Democrats hadsupported the measure. ``I do not think this is a partisan matterthat is being engineered for crass political purposes.''   The argument that the issue could be a potent election weaponagainst senators who opposed the amendment appeared to lose steamthis week.   Mitchell told reporters Thursday morning before the vote thatthe outcome, by then sure, was due to the ``sound judgment of theAmerican people.'' Other lawmakers said most Americans apparentlyare not overly interested in the proposed amendment.   The measure would have authorized state and federal governmentsto ban burning and desecration of the flag. Critics said the dangerto the flag was not as great as to the Bill of Rights.   ``For 200 years, they have protected the liberties of Americansthrough economic turmoil, civil war, political strife, socialupheaval and international tension,'' Mitchell said.   ``Despite the worst that fate has hurled at us, we have neverfound it necessary to abandon the fundamental principles on whichour government was founded and by which our liberties aresecured,'' he added.   ``We face no sudden or controllable burst of flag destruction.We face no massive alienation by our people from the symbols andtraditions of our nation. Yet we are being asked to believe thatthe flag which neither Hitler nor Stalin could defeat is nowthreatened by a single misguided person who most Americans neverheard of and don't care about,'' Mitchell said.   In a final appeal on behalf of the measure, Senate MinorityLeader Dole, R-Kan., took the Senate floor to invoke the history ofthe flag from Iwo Jima to the moon landing.   ``To say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeplyenshrined in the First Amendment is preposterous,'' Dole said. Hesaid it was wrong in view of laws that ``make it illegal to rip thewarning label off your own mattress in some states.''   ``The purpose, the need, for this amendment will not be found ina textbook or in a treatise on constitutional law,'' Dole said.``No, it will be found in the emotions of the heart, emotionsdeeply rooted in the real life experiences of millions of Americansand emotions that are crying out today to give the flag real andlasting protection.''   The vote came as no surprise to Republicans. Two GOPco-sponsors, Sens. John C. Danforth of Missouri and Warren Rudmanof New Hampshire, dropped their support Tuesday and joined theranks of the critics.</TEXT></DOC>
