Linda our leader is back!    --From &quot;A Hero Returns From Abroad,&quot; by and about Tamsanqa Linda.    PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa -- He is back, all right. Tamsanqa Linda is back in this tattered port city, running for re-election as mayor of the troubled black townships. Inside the Ibhayi City Council building, a fortress-like structure surrounded by razor wire and armed guards, he plots his campaign in a spartan office with the window shades pulled down.    &quot;The radicals, they'd like to get me again,&quot; he says. &quot;But I can't let that stop me.&quot;    The chubby, 41-year-old self-promoter is just the sort of man the government wants running its black townships. A former railroad ticket puncher, Mr. Linda was elected mayor in 1983. Two years later, he was run out of town by angry black residents who accused him of collaborating with the apartheid government.    Now, he is back, denouncing the militant foes of apartheid as &quot;radicals.&quot; He insists he is no &quot;government stooge&quot; though his political philosophy sounds strikingly like that being pressed by Pretoria: He favors flush toilets over equal rights for black South Africans. &quot;We have to remove the wrong political ideology that has been put in people's minds by the radicals,&quot; he says. &quot;That is why I have returned.&quot;    Today, for the first time in the nation's history, South Africans of all races are going to vote -- albeit at segregated polls to elect representatives to segregated city councils. The black elections are a crucial ingredient of the government's strategy to reassert authority in the black townships, following years of unrest in the mid-1980s.    But the government may be disappointed by the turnout at the polls. Black activists are urging a boycott of the elections, which they condemn as an extension of apartheid. Until blacks obtain voting rights on the national level, activists say, voting on the local level is meaningless.    Mr. Linda was last seen in these parts in late 1985, holed up in the Holiday Inn, surrounded by bodyguards, a mayor in disgrace and on the run. Members of the city's anti-apartheid organizations had denounced him for selling out the black struggle by serving the government. After Mr. Linda purchased the home of a black family that had been evicted for not paying the rent, residents' anger turned violent. They took a torch to the mayor's house and his general store.    Similar things happened to black councilors across the country. Some were killed by angry mobs. Mr. Linda was lucky; he escaped with his life. For two months after fleeing the townships, he lived at the Holiday Inn, then left without paying the bill. &quot;He ate breakfast here with the state president one day,&quot; the hotel manager says, &quot;so we figured his credit was good.&quot;    Mr. Linda did, too; he says he thought the city council would pick up the entire tab, but it left a debt of roughly the equivalent of $5,000. Under a court order, Mr. Linda recently agreed to repay the debt in monthly installments.    After checking out of the Holiday Inn, Mr. Linda returned to his tribal home in the black homeland of Transkei, where he arranged demonstrations against the anti-apartheid leader, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu. From time to time, Mr. Linda also popped up in Europe and North America, speaking on behalf of his United Christian Conciliation Party, a conservative black party that Mr. Linda claims has four million members. Not coincidentally, many are members of the Reformed Independent Churches Association, headed by Bishop Isaac Mokoena, who co-founded the party with Mr. Linda.    While Mr. Linda was away, South Africa erupted. Pretoria imposed a state of emergency, detained thousands of black political opponents and banned a host of anti-apartheid organizations -- including those that had forced Mr. Linda out of town. Mr. Linda, figuring it was safe to return to Port Elizabeth, came home and declared himself candidate for mayor.    &quot;I'm fighting back to prove to the radicals that I'm one of the greatest leaders in the county,&quot; says Mr. Linda. &quot;I'm not hiding. I'm prepared to speak out.&quot;    Mostly he does this from inside his maroon BMW, shouting through the two loudspeakers strapped to the roof of the car as he meanders through the potholed and narrow dirt roads of the townships. These streets, lined with dilapidated shacks, are teeming with tension. Port Elizabeth was one of the hottest areas of the country during the unrest of the mid-1980s, and the government fears that its 500,000 black residents could erupt again.    Mr. Linda worries, too. His BMW has been stoned, and last week the homes of several other candidates for city council were firebombed. One other candidate was shot to death. But for the most part, it seems, his campaign is being ignored. A recent rally attracted no more than 60 to a cavernous hall where 200 chairs had been set up for the anticipated crowd. Of those who came, most were elderly, unemployed women behind on their rent payments and hoping for help from Mr. Linda.    &quot;Oooh, he's powerful,&quot; says a matronly women named Joyce. &quot;He'll give out food and houses and jobs to those who support him. He's a great man.&quot;    Mr. Linda's campaign literature echoes her sentiments. He wrote most of the pamphlets himself, including a poem in which he hails himself as a black hero: &quot;Our father Linda is our leader! The people told Linda to take his seat on Oct. 26 as a mayor! and build houses for them. The leader promised.&quot;    Such patronage costs money, and the government is ready to spend plenty here after the election in an effort to bolster the credibility of the black council and its mayor. But Mr. Linda, whose campaign is on a shoestring budget, is taking no chances on the money running out.    &quot;Tell America to send money,&quot; Mr. Linda tells an American visitor.    &quot;Send it to whom?&quot; he is asked.    &quot;To me and my party,&quot; he says. &quot;You send money to the radicals. Why not send some to me?&quot;    Black activists shrug off the elections as a farce. &quot;Our people won't vote until our real leaders are released from detention and we can vote for them,&quot; says a member of the banned Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organization who is in hiding in the townships. He points to a polling station recently built by the government -- a one-room concrete hut surrounded by rolls of razor wire and guarded around the clock by several soldiers -- and laughs at the idea of holding elections under the state of emergency.    &quot;A vote in these elections is a vote for our continued oppression,&quot; he says. &quot;The people see Linda's name and they know right away that the elections are illegitimate. Everyone identifies him with the system.&quot;    Mr. Linda doesn't seem to mind the association. &quot;We must support local government, for right now that is what the government is giving us. It is a step along the way,&quot; he says. &quot;The radicals say they won't take part in elections until all political prisoners are released. But municipal elections are not the place to call for their release. That time will come.&quot;    Mr. Linda says blacks are more interested in improving their living conditions than in equal political representation. &quot;The radicals are introducing foreign ideas that don't fit in this country,&quot; he says. &quot;A system of one-man, one-vote in a unitary state, which the radicals want, won't work in South Africa. The people in the townships aren't interested in living in white areas, like the radicals say. They just want to be taken care of in their townships.&quot;    Mr. Linda says he is the man to do this in Port Elizabeth. He promises to start spending the million of dollars the government has earmarked for upgrading projects in the black townships. He talks about putting a flush toilet in every house. He assures those threatened with eviction for not paying their rent that he won't turn them out. For now, the other things, like equal rights, can wait. </TEXT></DOC>
