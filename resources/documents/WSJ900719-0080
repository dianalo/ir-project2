Skittish investors found reasons to unload stocks of manycompanies despite profit reports that at first blush appearedrobust.</LP><TEXT>   MCI Communications, which came under pressure Tuesdayafter competitor United Telecommunications's US Sprint unitreported a huge loss, fell further yesterday even though itssecond-quarter income was at the high end of analystsexpectations. The stock lost 1 7/8 to 36 1/2.   Intel, which reported strong second-quarter resultsTuesday, came under further selling pressure yesterday,dropping 2 points to 48 1/2.   &quot;I've never seen a market go from euphoria to completepessimism in such a short amount of time,&quot; says JimTarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht andamp; Quist in SanFrancisco.   The selling sent the Nasdaq Composite Index careening 3.66points for a 0.8%-drop to 460.82. The New York Stock Exchangedidn't fare any better, with the composite index there losing0.83%   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 791 to 1,107. Volumeeased to 159 million shares from Tuesday's 167.8 millionshares.   Hambrecht andamp; Quist's Mr. Tarrantino says the profit-takinghas been orderly. But analysts and investors are franticalyreassessing outlooks for many of the OTC market's largestcompanies.   MCI Communications reported profit of 67 cents a share inthe latest second quarter, up from 56 cents a year ago. Thatwas at the high end of the range of 64 cents to 68 cents ashare estimated by analysts.   But MCI's stock fell yesterday on concerns that revenuegrowth from the first quarter was not as robust as someinvestors had hoped. The second quarter's $1.86 billion inrevenue was up about 3% from the first quarter.   PaineWebber telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman saysthe revenues were about $40 million below what he had hopedfor, adding that many people were looking for 5% growth inrevenue from the first quarter.   &quot;People are worried about the longterm growth rate,&quot; Mr.Grubman says. He adds that both MCI and US Sprint are losingmarket share to American Telephone andamp; Telegraph in thehigh-margin general business market. Mr. Grubman hasn'tchanged his rating on the stock or estimates for thecompany's future earnings.   &quot;The stock market isn't being driven by Wall Streetanalysts, but by investors who are beginning to worry aboutthe revenues,&quot; the PaineWebber analyst says.   Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst RajivChaudhri removed Intel from the firm's &quot;focus list&quot; of stocksthat are attractive on the short-term basis.   Mr. Chaudhri says this stock remains on Goldman's&quot;recommended for purchase list&quot; for long-term orientedinvestors. But he says the company's microprocessor revenueis slowing on a quarter-to-quarter basis, while analysts'earnings estimates continue to rise. That means Intel is lesslikely to do much more than meet analysts estimates in thenear future, Mr. Chaudhri says.   Lotus Development sank 2 7/8 to 31 1/4 despite reportingthat its profit surged to 54 cents a share in the latestsecond quarter from 25 cents a year earlier. But the companytold analysts at a meeting later in the day that it thinksWall Street's third quarter earnings estimates are too high.   Apple Computer was a rare winner among the big OTCtechnology stocks yesterday. The computer maker's stock rose3/8 to 44 5/8 in anticipation of its third quarter earningsreport, released after the market closed. Apple reported thatit earned 96 cents a share in the quarter, compared to 74cents a year earlier. But Apple cautioned that its operatingearnings for the fourth quarter may not match those posted ayear earlier. For the fourth quarter ended Sept. 29, 1989,Apple reported profit of $161 million, or $1.24 a share,which included a gain of $8 million, or 37 cents a share,from the sale of Apple's stake in Adobe Systems.   Hambrecht andamp; Quist computer analyst Bruce Lupatkin saidApple &quot;painted a pretty dismal picture&quot; in a conference callwith analysts late yesterday. The company told analysts it isin a &quot;transitional period&quot; that is likely to continue throughthe first half on fiscal 1991, Mr. Lupatkin said.   Cetus fell 1 1/4 to 17 1/2 on volume of more than 3million shares. The company has announced that it hadtemporarily stopped testing of Proleukin as a potentialhypertension drug, citing difficulty in replicating resultsfrom animal testing. The drug is currently pending approvalby the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatmentof kidney cancer. An FDA advisory committee panel will hear apresentation on the drug at the end of July.   American Ecology rose 2 3/4 to 8 1/4 after it reportedsecond quarter profit of 57 cents a share, compared with aloss from continuing operations of 11 cents a share a yearago. The company's revenue rose to $14.7 million from $9.6million.</TEXT></DOC>
