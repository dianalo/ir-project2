Manuel Antonio Noriega was ashrewd and ruthless survivor, and it was often said that he wouldprefer death to losing power.   Even after U.S. troops invaded Panama last week, he broadcast adefiant message from hiding, vowing ``to win or die _ not one stepback.''   On Sunday, Noriega came out of hiding and sought politicalasylum at the Vatican embassy in Panama City.   During his tenure as ruler of Panama he eliminated politicalopposition, nullified the May 7 elections when they were goingagainst him and repeatedly defied the United States, which indictedhim on drug trafficking charges in February 1988.   In a speech after the indictments in Floria, Noriega brandisheda machete above his head and slammed it down on the podium, againusing the phrase ``Not one step back!''   It had long been known that ``Tony'' Noriega enjoyed a crisisand it was widely said he would prefer death to losing power. Hereveled in thumbing his nose at the United States, which he called``the colossus of the north.''   Noriega, who comes from El Chorrillo, the Panama City districtwhere the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters is located,created a mystique that won him the nickname ``The Man,'' theEnglish word his initials spell.   Noriega wrapped himself in nationalism, saying it was part ofthe historic mission of his generation to take control of thePanama Canal. Under an accord with the United States, Panama is totake over the canal by the year 2000. Noriega claimed his enemieswere plotting to abrogate the canal pact.   He said Washington wanted to oust him to make it easier for theUnited States to renege on the canal treaties.   On Oct. 3, elements of the 15,000-man Defense Forces hecommanded rebelled and claimed they had deposed him, but troopsloyal to him suppressed the rebellion and he personally acceptedthe rebels' surrender.   During his last crisis in May after the opposition swamped hiscandidate the annulled presidential elections, Noriega was seenstanding alone before the tomb of his patron, Gen. Omar Torrijos.   The epitaph on the tomb is: ``I don't want to enter heaven. Ijust want to enter the Canal Zone.''   Torrijos, who seized power in a 1968, signed the 1977 accordwith former President Carter to turn over the canal. Torrijos diedin a plane crash in 1981, and Noriega became commander of theDefense Forces in 1983, giving him de facto control of thegovernment.   Noriega was raised by foster parents and joined the DefenseForces in 1962. His ascent began when he caught the attention ofTorrijos, then an ambitious young officer.   In his climb to the top, he dealt with everyone from the CIA toColombian cocaine cartels.   Less than a year after Torrijos took power in 1968 coup, he madeNoriega, then an obscure major, chief of intelligence with the rankof lieutenant colonel.   It was like having the keys to the city. Noriega immediatelybegan compiling dossiers on everyone who counted in Panama. The jobalso gave him close contact with U.S. intelligence agencies, and heformed powerful alliances.   One U.S. official who dealt with Noriega at the time, on drugenforcement efforts, said Noriega was polite but when it came tosomething he wanted, he was ``the coldest man I ever met.''   After Noriega became the Defense Forces commander, he acquired afleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood.   His financial interests reportedly included a vast array ofbusinesses including hotels, casinos, a television station, radiostations, maritime services, duty-free liquor stores andprostitution.   Rumors about his personal life were plentiful, but there werefew facts. Even his age was disputed. The general has said he is51, but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54.   He is married and has a daughter who lives in the DominicanRepublic.   Although wealthy, he worked hard to develop a populist imagemodeled on the revered Torrijos, spending weekends meeting withresidents of towns and villages in this nation of 2.2 million.   Noriega often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes hisdomestic opponents as rich and white. ``The humble, the poor andthe blacks, they are the utmost authority of the people,'' he oncesaid.   As the standoff with the United States dragged on, Noriegaenjoyed underlining what he termed Washington's helplessness,despite the 12,000 troops it stationed in Panama.   Noriega exercised power with ruthless assurance. He closednewspapers for months at a time. Presidents served at his pleasure.   Rumors of opposition inside the Defense Forces were met withpurges and reorganizations. ``Kisses,'' was how he described thebullets fired in an attempted coup in March 1988.   The United States, long his ally, began to distance itself afterthe headless body of one of his opponents, Hugo Spadadora, wasfound in a U.S. mailbag in Costa Rica in 1985.   A full break came in February 1988, when two federal grandjuries in Florida indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking andmoney-laundering charges.   The domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign againstNoriega and Washington imposed crippling economic sanctions, butNoriega didn't budge.   An intelligence source in Washington said that in the monthsleading up the October coup attempt, there had been reports of adeterioration in Noriega's mental state, including increasedparanoia and constant drinking.   Through his control of the Defense Forces, he was named chief of    government on Dec. 15 by a rubber-stamp assembly. It said hisleadership was needed to confront a ``state of war'' caused by U.S.economic sanctions and other efforts to oust the general.</TEXT></DOC>
