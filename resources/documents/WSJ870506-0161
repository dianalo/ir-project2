Sales at the West German electronics company jumped 18%, to $14.7 billion from $12.44 billion. All figures are converted at the mark's current rate.    Siemens said sales in the latest period were boosted by delayed accounting for delivery of a nuclear power plant in Brokdorf, West Germany. Domestic sales climbed 32%, to $7.75 billion from $5.82 billion. Without the Brokdorf project, domestic sales would have risen 5%, Siemens said.    Export sales increased 6%, to $6.96 billion from $6.62 billion. The company said increased business volume from its acquisitions compensated for the negative effect on orders from the lower dollar.    Siemens gained an important distribution vehicle in the U.S. earlier this year through the purchase of most operations of Telecom Plus International Inc. Analysts said that acquisition will aid the German company in its effort to market its digital telephone switching gear in North America.    Fiona Ward, a London-based analyst who follows German stocks for Enskilda Securities Ltd., said Siemens will benefit from an improving position in the American telecommunications market in coming years, as well as from good order bookings for its Kraftwerk Union AG power-station unit. </TEXT></DOC>
