Section 71.181of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in Handbook7400.6E, dated January 3, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule</ITAG>This amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations will revisethe transition area located at Laredo, TX. The development of a new VOR/DMERWY 17 SIAP to the Rancho Blanco Airport, utilizing the Laredo VORTAC,has necessitated this revision. The intended effect of this revision isto provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing the newSIAP. Coincident with this action is the changing of the status of theRancho Blanco Airport from VFR to IFR.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, Transition areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
