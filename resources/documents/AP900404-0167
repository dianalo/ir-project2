(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of space shuttle Atlantis' fuelcells probably was damaged because excessive pressure was exertedwhen the unit was being prepared for removal, NASA said Wednesday.   The extent of damage was not immediately known, said Dick Young,a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.   There are enough other fuel cells in the system for flight, andany damage will not affect Atlantis' next mission in July. Atlantisreturned to Kennedy Space Center on March 13 following a secretPentagon mission to send a $500 million spy satellite into orbit.   Fuel cells provide electrical power to space shuttles through areaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.   One of the fuel cell unit's 96 individual cells had failed avoltage test during a postflight checkout March 31, Young said.   NASA decided to remove the entire unit and return it for repairto the vendor, International Fuel Cells of Hartford, Conn., Youngsaid. The unit had been purged with gaseous helium following theMarch 31 test, and residual gas pressure was being vented outWednesday.   ``As the operation proceeded, it became apparent that the oxygenvent was working but the hydrogen vent was not,'' NASA said in astatement issued Wednesday night. ``It was discovered that a caphad been placed on the vehicle's hydrogen vent port, possibly as aconclusion of the March 31 electrical test.''   The procedure was halted immediately, and the area was clearedof workers as a safety precaution, Young said.   The oxygen and hydrogen sides of the fuel cells are divided by aplate an eighth of an inch thick containing potassium hydroxide, acorrosive chemical used as an electrolyte. Pressure normally iskept higher on the oxygen side of the cell to keep the potassiumhydroxide from seeping through.   Young said the potassium hydroxide likely was forced into theoxygen side of the cell, causing the difference in pressure oneither side to exceed allowable levels. That could affect the fuelcell's operation and corrode the oxygen piping, he said.   The fuel cell will be removed as soon as possible, Young said.   Young said NASA planned to appoint a review board to investigatethe matter. He declined to comment further.</TEXT></DOC>
