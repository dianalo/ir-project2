But the European Economic Community should not reconsider itsrefusal to accept U.S. meat products containing growth hormones,Genscher said in an interview with Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio.   He said the ban ``is not any form of discrimination because thesame rules apply to all of us, and the decision is based on healthpolicies.''   American officials are threatening to impose $100 million worthof trade sanctions on European food products starting Sunday becauseof the EEC's refusal to accept American meat containing growthhormones.   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Tuesday thatthe sanctions, which would effectively double the price of Europeanfood imports, would go into effect unless the meat restrictions arelifted.   The use of growth hormones on livestock is prohibited in the EEC,although a number of scandals involving illegal hormones have rockedthe meat industries of West Germany and other European nations inrecent months.   Genscher urged that no countermeasures be undertaken by the EECif the U.S. sanctions are imposed. He said the two sides should tryto resolve their disagreement through the framework of theinternational General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT.   Genscher said the EEC should try to defuse the dispute in talkswith the American government at the same time.   European and some American consumer groups say the hormones,which U.S. producers use to make cattle grow faster, are hazardousto human health. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says thequantities are miniscule compared with the amounts of the samehormones produced by the human body.   The FDA approves only three kinds of hormone treatment _estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. It banned diethylstilbestrol, or DES, 10 years ago after it was proven to becancer-causing.   Use of DES by European cattle growers led to a scare for Italianconsumers in 1980, when hundreds of children showed signs of earlysexual development such as breast growth.   Residues of DES were also discovered in residents of West Germanyand Holland, prompting a consumer movement that led to European-widelegislation against hormone-treated meat.</TEXT></DOC>
