The United States stands to lose the friendship of 21 Arabpowers by ``exaggerating its support for Israel,'' he said.   Otherwise, he said, the United Arab Emirates ``has warm andfriendly relations with America.''   Answering a wide range of questions by Arab and foreignreporters, the sheik lauded Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachevfor introducing ``appreciable changes'' for his people.   But he cautioned the Arabs against hinging any hopes on theU.S.-Soviet summit talks, contending that ``the two superpowerscare more about their own interests and less about everythingelse.''   The 71-year-old president rejected the concept of Arab unity asa ``meaningless hallucination.'' He stressed that ideas of``integration or cooperation are far more meaningful.''   ``I have been hearing the term unity for 40 years now but haveseen nothing real, nothing tangible, of it,'' he said. ``We haveopted for cooperation, as opposed to unity in the common sense ofthe term in our parlance.''   He was referring to the creation of the Gulf CooperationCouncil, a six-nation economic integration and collective defensepact grouping Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and theUnited Arab Emirates.   The United Arab Emirates was created in 1971 by merging theseven sheikdoms of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Umm al-Quwain,Fujairah, Ajman and Ras al-Khaimah.</TEXT></DOC>
