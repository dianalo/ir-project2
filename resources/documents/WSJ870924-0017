But an EPA spokesman, David Cohen, said the agency has no evidence to suggest that the levels of contamination present a health risk.    Greenpeace, an environmental group, said a paper-industry study found dioxin contamination of some paper products in the low parts-per-trillion range. The EPA says regular consumption of fish with that level of contamination might cause concern over human-health effects. But for contaminated earth, which usually doesn't penetrate the body, the agency calls for cleanups if the concentration reaches one part per billion.    The discovery of dioxin in paper follows a finding by the EPA and the paper industry that some paper mills produce low levels of dioxin in the process of bleaching pulp. As a result, warnings against fish consumption were issued for some rivers downstream from mills.    The EPA has said it is considering regulating dioxin in waste water emitted from mills.    Mr. Cohen said the EPA has no evidence that dioxin in paper would penetrate human bodies. But he said some federal agency may need to study whether such a risk might result from the use of such things as paper coffee filters, feminine hygiene products and baby diapers. </TEXT></DOC>
