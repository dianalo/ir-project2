KENT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Sears' 824 stores across the nation began reopening today after a42-hour facelift to complete price reductions on 1.5 billion piecesof merchandise.   ``People are backed up as far as we can see. It's wall-to-wallpeople,'' said Bob Dumas, manager of the Sears, Roebuck and Co.store at the Northland Mall in Columbus, Ohio.   ``We have Christmas-quantity people, and we have better thanChristmas traffic,'' said Dumas, who estimated more than 1,000people waited outside for the doors to open.   Workers changed prices Tuesday on everything _ including lightbulbs, toasters and polished door knobs _ as Sears prepared for anew retailing strategy it hopes will win customers.   Employees also had to change signs and displays, take inventoryand clean up before the openings, which occurred at noon local time.   ``The worst was the screwdrivers,'' said Chris Skinner, a highschool freshman who spent much of the day at the Northland Mallstore repricing baby booties and toddlers' dresses. ``You had totake them all down, clean each one by hand, then put them all back.''all.Otherwise, it willuse the strategy that retailers call ``everyday low pricing.''   Sears, in adopting the strategy, joins a growing list, thatincludes K mart Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount chainand Montgomery Ward and Co.   At the Columbus store, 700 workers scrambled to the tune of``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' as they marked down items such as twincanopy beds from $269.99 to $99.00, a Diehard automobile batteryfrom $72 to $64, and a Craftsman power drill from $59.99 to $32.62.   Sears' new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its ownbrands and the 1,000 other brand names it carries.   ``I don't think they had any choice. They lost their customerbase,'' said Karen Sacks, an analyst with Standard and Poor's Corp.in New York. ``I think Wednesday will be a madhouse at Sears. Butwill they be able to re-educate their customers not to come in justfor a sale?''   Monroe Greenstein, an analyst with the investment firm BearStearns in New York, said the strategy paid off in Wichita, Kan.,where sales rose 15 percent when Sears tested the idea last fall.   ``And Sears will invest in an advertising campaign that, to nothear about it, you would practically have to be comatose,''Greenstein said.   The cash register rings about 3,000 times a day in the100,000-square-foot Columbus store, but the only sound in the lastcouple of days was the clicking of pricing guns and muffled soundsof store officials keeping in touch with walkie-talkies.   About 100 high school students worked for $5 an hour to helpcompany officials in shirt-sleeves and scores of others with themakeover.   ``It's the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in inSears,'' said Bob Dumas, manager of the Northland Mall store and a30-year Sears employee.   ``It's no longer that old sea of yellow,'' he said, referring toSears' old yellow-with-black-lettering sale signs.   The new signs, touting new, lower prices, are in vibrant red andblue. In apparel, the signs are magenta and gray.   ``They really needed to do something dramatic like that,'' Ms.Sacks said. ``We'll just have to wait a year or two to see if itworks.''</TEXT></DOC>
