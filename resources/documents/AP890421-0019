Gerhard Roux, chief aide to Namibia Administrator-General LouisPienaar, gave the death toll for the Thursday afternoon battlebefore flying north Friday on what he said was a routine trip.   He said he had no more information about the clash.   Col. Richard Warren, commander of Australian U.N. militaryforces in northern Namibia, said the battle was reported to beserious. He said it took place three to five miles from Okankolo,which lies about 30 miles southeast of Ondangwa airbase, where Rouxwas headed.   Martti Ahtisaari, the special U.N. representative for Namibia,was informed of the fighting, sources said.   The United Nations forces in Namibia have set up assembly pointsin the north for the guerrillas to report to and be transportedback across the border to Angola.   But according to police and military reports, most of theguerrillas who have left crossed the border on their own ratherthan report to the assembly points or to church premises, whichalso have been declared safe havens.   The incursion by several hundred guerrillas from the South-WestAfrican People's Organization, or SWAPO, across the border fromAngola on April 1 interrupted the implementation of a U.N. peaceplan intended to lead to independence elections in November.   South Africa, which has ruled the territory for 74 years, hadagreed to the plan, which called for the orderly, unarmed return ofthe guerrillas in mid-May from their bases in Angola and Tanzania.   SWAPO guerrillas have been fighting since 1966 to end SouthAfrican control of the territory, which is also called South-WestAfrica.   In another development, a U.N. official said Thursday the UnitedNations has completed an investigation into allegations of policeintimidation at a mission station in northern Namibia and has askedthe South African-appointed administrator of the territory to takeaction.   U.N. official Cedric Thornberry said the report by the U.N.police commissioner, Steven Fanning, would not be made public.   Residents of the area around Oshikuku, where some SWAPOguerrillas had assembled for transport to Angola, had told churchofficials and reporters that police threatened and harassed them inan attempt to make them give information about guerrillas in thearea.</TEXT></DOC>
