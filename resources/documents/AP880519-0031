Rabin made the comment Wednesday, a day after one Palestinianguerrilla crossed the border fence between Jordan and Israel andwas wounded and captured by Israeli troops. Two other guerrillasescaped back to Jordan.   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the authorities in Egypt andJordan are doing sometimes not everything that can be done toprevent the (infiltrations),'' Rabin said on Israel radio.   Tuesday night's infiltration was the second from Jordan and the13th attempt since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip. Since Dec. 1, guerrillas have twice triedto enter Israel from Egypt.   Rabin linked the increase in infiltration attempts to the``intefadah,'' Arabic for uprising. He charged the PLO withinciting terror attacks from Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt as well asinside the occupied lands to breathe life into the rebellion.   But Rabin said that thanks to the army's tough response, theuprising was dying out. ``We have seen a gradual reduction ofcivilian violent activities as a result of ... measures we havetaken such as arrests, administrative detentions, deportations,''he said on a tour of the Gaza Strip.   Jordan denied that the latest raid into Israel was launched fromits territory, saying it ``would never allow infiltrators to crossfrom Jordan into occupied Arab territories.''   In another development, Israeli troops backed by helicopters andbulldozers on Wednesday carried out a pre-dawn raid on two Arabmountain villages and were surrounded by hundreds of stone-throwingPalestinians. Hospital officials said one Arab villager was killedand 10 were wounded.   Troops also shot and wounded four Arabs during a confrontationin the marketplace of Nablus, the largest West Bank city, the armysaid.   The fatality Wednesday brought the Arab death toll in theuprising to 191, according to U.N. figures. Two Israelis also havedied.   Arab doctors said at least 20 Palestinians were injured bybeatings and rubber bullets during the clashes in Abwein and Arura,neighboring villages north of Ramallah. Witnesses said hundredswere arrested.   An army spokesman confirmed one Arab was killed and ninewounded. But he refused comment on the arrests or the reason forthe sweeps on the final day of Id el Fitr, the three-day Moslemholiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.   In both villages fighting lasted through Wednesday morning, withhelicopters dropping tear gas, before soldiers gained control andmoved from house to house in search of suspects, witnesses said.   In Arura, troops rounded up about 300 teen-agers and young menin a schoolyard, a 19-year-old Palestinian said from his hospitalbed in Ramallah.   In Abwein, soldiers made no arrests, apparently because mostyouths fled into the surrounding hills, said a merchant who wouldonly give his first name, Saam. But he said troops beat severalwomen and in some cases smashed furniture with clubs.   Army bulldozers pushed aside roadblocks that had been set up byvillagers and forced residents to remove outlawed Palestinian flagsfrom a mosque tower and utility poles, witnesses said.   A black flag of mourning fluttered from the home of MajdiYoussef Hilal, a 16-year-old boy who was fatally shot in the chestduring the clashes.   In Nablus, troops were attacked by youths throwing stones asthey patrolled the city's market, an army spokesman said.   ``The troops fired at the Arabs when they were in danger,''wounding four Palestinians, the spokesman said.   The Defense Ministry on Wednesday ordered that teen-agers in theGadna paramilitary youth corps not be allowed to serve in areaswhere Arab prisoners were held, the army said.   A army spokesman said the order was in response to an incidentin which a teen-ager in the corps beat an Arab prisoner during avisit to a detention center after being encouraged to do so by anarmy sergeant.</TEXT></DOC>
