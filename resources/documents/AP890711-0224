The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 70.75 points, or 0.21percent, closing at 33,746.77. The index had fallen 27.95 pointsMonday.   The dollar closed at 139.62 yen, up 0.34 yen from Monday's139.28-yen finish. It opened at 139.47 yen and ranged narrowlybetween 139.47 yen and 139.78 yen. The dollar had declined 0.37 yenon Monday.   Ichiro Ikeda, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said tradingwas quiet in the absence of fresh market-affecting news.   He said the dollar rose today mainly because many New Yorkinvestors who had sold dollars earlier were buying them back inposition adjustments.   Most Japanese market players remained on the sidelines to awaitthe release Friday of the U.S. wholesale price index, Ikeda added.   ``Expectations that the United States will make a further move torelax its monetary policy no longer are affecting the Tokyo marketbecause it has been expected for quite some time already,'' Ikedasaid.   But lower U.S. interest rates could discourage dollar-buying, hesaid.   Following Friday's prime lending rate cut of 0.5 percentage pointby Southwest Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank also cut its rate Monday by0.5 percentage point from 11 percent.   On the stock market, trading was thin because most investors hadlittle buying incentive before the July 23 elections for half theseats in Parliament's upper house, said Daiwa Securities dealerKenji Ishizuka.   Analysts predict the governing Liberal Democratic Party willsuffer major losses, and investors expect such a defeat for thepro-business party would push down stock prices.   Volume on the first section was estimated at 550 million shares,up from Monday's 500 million. Among gainers were steel, securitiesand bank issues.</TEXT></DOC>
