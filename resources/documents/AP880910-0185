(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Willis ``Be Bop'' Edwards goes whereverblues great B.B. King travels. The two men have been inseparablesince 1952 when King got into Edwards' taxi in Houston, Texas.   ``I'm right there with the band every day. I'm writing a book,`B.B. King, Then and Now,''' Edwards said in an interview at hishome in Mobile.   King is 64. Edwards, a great-grandfather of four, will be 65 inNovember. Neither plans to retire soon.   ``He stays polished,'' Edwards said.   Edwards, now the singer's road manager, began as his valet.   ``I was driving a taxi cab for a studio. This guy that owned thecab line owned a couple of recording companies. He had me go to thehotel and take King to his lawyer's office to sign the papers tostart recording.''   Edwards parked his cab that day and left with King.   ``From that date to this one, I've been with him.''   King started in the early days playing black clubs around thecountry.   ``That was from the '50s until the early part of the '60s,''Edwards said. ``King's fortunes changed when he guest-starred withEric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin at Fillmore West (inSan Francisco). When he made the record, `The Thrill Is Gone,' thatwas the major change.   ``The crowd now is 75 to 80 percent white. Deep South, the crowdis more black,'' Edwards said. ``It varies with the territory.''   Edwards moved to Mobile 25 years ago and began operatingrestaurants and nightclubs. Everything was called ``Be Bop's'' _record shop, social club, chicken shack and lately his tamale plaza.   ``We sell hot tamales and boudin (a Cajun sausage with rice).The tamales come from Mississippi, the boudin is from NewOrleans,'' he said.   When he gets the call from Polly Walker, King's secretary inMemphis, Tenn., Edwards goes on the road. Her husband, Cato, whodied this summer, was King's long-time bus driver, and her twodaughters worked for King. She said they all have been friends forlife.   ``I grew up across the street from King's house in Memphis,''Mrs. Walker said.   Edwards has been with King the longest of his co-workers. Hetakes his wife, Lillie, with him on concert trips when possible.Bus driver Barnett Fogg has been with them 11 years, and tenor saxEddie Synagal has nine years with the group.   The King show has made two European trips this year, in Marchand July. Edwards said they hit 29 cities. ``Every day it was adifferent language, different money, different food,'' Edwards said.   ``I've been going to Europe for the last 20 years. I'm goingtwice again before Christmas.''   Edwards doesn't play any instrument. ``I don't handle nothingbut money and writing checks. But I know music, I've got to knowmusic to hire and fire.''   King, he said, is all blues: ``If B.B. King sang the nationalanthem, it would be bluesy.''   King, who lives in Las Vegas, Nev., rose to fame from humblebginnings in Indianola, Miss. With a New York agent, hisperformance itinerary runs nearly year-round.   ``He's got people, family all over the United States,'' Edwardssaid.   He said King's favorite place is his home in Las Vegas, but Kingrecently purchased a new bus manufactured in Belgium. ``It tookthem nine months to make it to B.B. King's specifications. The samething that's in a Stouffer's hotel is in that bus.   ``When we're traveling down the highway, people take pictures ofit from their cars,'' Edwards said.   The group does as much flying as bus travel. That's all in starkcontrast to the early days, when the band got around in a fewstation wagons and a Cadillac. Back then, they were worried aboutbeing able to use public restrooms because they were segregated andblack people were not permitted to use them.   Edwards said he has kept Mobile as his home base because of hisfamily and business interests. He has stayed despite the lack ofmajor entertainment _ blues or jazz.   ``The people here are not ready for it,'' he said. ``They won'tsupport it. A lot of people notice it, but it's the less supportingentertainment city in the world. For what reason, I don't know.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Fri Sept. 23</NOTE></DOC>
