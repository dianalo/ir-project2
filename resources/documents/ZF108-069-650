 The configuration features the HP DeskJet Plus inkjetprinter, Adobe Type Manager and either Orange Micro's Grappler LXcable or the MacPrint DeskJet driver.andP;  There are some drawbacks:inkjet printers cost more per page in the long run than laser-jetprinters, the user must figure out spooling, and PostScriptdrawing programs such as Adobe Illustrator cannot be used.andP;

carried a hefty pricetag in the Macintosh universe.andP;  The minimum requirement for high-qualityoutput was a Post-Script laser printer, a Mac, cables, software and fonts.andO;If you threw in faster processing speed, a hard disk and other goodies, youwere looking at nine or 10 grand just to start.andP;  The arrival of QuickDrawlaser printers like the GCC Personal LaserPrinter and the Apple LaserWriterII SC lowered the outlay considerably, but these machines' limits on fontusage kept them poor cousins indeed to their more-expensive relatives.andM;For those without the budget or the print volume needed to justify theexpense of laser devices geared to the Mac, desktop publishing remained aluxury.andP;  As 300-dpi output became de rigueur for almost all businesscommunications, I heard a lot of grumbling about the cost of Mac technology.andO;Not a few users were driven to the MS-DOS world, sacrificing the ease of theMac's interface and software for access to printers such as theHewlett-Packard DeskJet, the HP LaserJet series and LaserJet work-alikes fromother vendors, many of which weighed in at less than half the cost of thecheapest PostScript devices.andM;Some users who stayed loyal to the Mac turned to early versions of OrangeMicro's Grapplers, &quot;smart&quot; cables with QuickDraw routines in firmware, orInsight Development Corp.'s MacPrint software drivers for HP printers.andO;Although these products enabled Mac owners to use non-Mac printers, theyrelied on the technique of reducing bit maps to achieve the desiredresolution.andP;  For each size of each font you wished to use at 300 dpi, you hadto stuff your system with bit maps of both the correct size for the displayand a 400 percent multiple for the printer.andP;  What a pain!andM;I'm pleased to report that times have changed.andP;  For the past couple of monthsI've been experimenting with low-cost desktop publishing.andP;  My setup hasincluded Adobe Type Manager, the HP DeskJet Plus inkjet printer, and eitherthe MacPrint DeskJet driver or Orange Micro's Grappler LX cable.andP;  Frankly,I've been amazed at the results.andP;  With street prices for the basicconfiguration totaling less than $900, I'm getting top-quality 300-dpi outputwithout much loss of flexibility.andM;These are all superior items, but the Adobe product is the magic bullet.andO;Because ATM uses compact PostScript outline files to generate data for theprinter, it gives me the ability to produce nifty layouts with lots oftypefaces at odd point sizes; without it, I'd be back to playing games withbit maps.andP;  So I'm very happy.andP;  While I have not tested every possiblecombination of software, hardware and layout tactics, I've proved to myselfthat this collection of tools is more than adequate for the bulk of myday-to-day printouts.andP;  And even though the inkjet is more expensive to runthan a laser printer on a page-by-page basis, it will be a long time before Iburn through enough ink cartridges to equal the cost differential between theDeskJet and any laser printer.andM;There are, of course, some drawbacks.andP;  I've lost the use of PostScriptdrawing programs like Adobe Illustrator and Aldus FreeHand, I'm scratching myhead over the mathematics of reconciling 72- or 288-dpi data with 300-dpioutput, and I haven't quite figured out how to manage spooling (a necessitybecause imaging can be time-consuming).andP;  And I'm not sure I'd recommend thisstrategy to anyone in a heavy graphics-production environment, even for roughproofs.andP;  But then, those folks should all have PostScript capacity, shouldn'tthey?andM;What it boils down to is that designers on a shoestring need no longerbutcher their layouts to match restricted output possibilities.andP;  Thesuffering is over; we now have alternatives.andP;  The DeskJet Plus is perfect forme, since I also own a bunch of non-Mac computers that can print to it.andP;  Forthose with only Mac equipment, the HP DeskWriter obviates the need forspecial drivers and adds a bit of speed.andP;  If you up the stakes by $500 to$1,000, you can buy a LaserJet variant and a driver, or choose a QuickDrawprinter.andP;  Naturally, you've got to do your homework; certain configurationsdemand so much processing from the CPU that printing can take an eternity.andM;But whatever your specific needs, it's gratifying to have a solid middleground between PostScript laser printers and dot-matrix printers.andP;  At last.andO;n</TEXT></DOC>
