Timothy Ryan Jr. as top savings and loanregulator, but Democrats also gained.   Ryan, a labor lawyer with no banking experience, was confirmedon a 62-37 vote as director of the Treasury Department's Office ofThrift Supervision. He's expected to be sworn into office Monday.   The administration lobbied hard for that result. TreasurySecretary Nicholas F. Brady worked the phone for days. White Houselobbyist Tom Korologos roamed the halls of Congress. Ryan himselfmet with dozens of senators, some as late as Wednesday morning, theday of the vote.   The hard work paid off in a wider-than-predicted victory.Seventeen Democrats joined all 45 Republicans in endorsing Ryan.That left 37 Democrats opposed.   Democrats acknowledged from the outset that the battle was lost.Yet, for six hours leading to the vote, they railed against Ryan asunqualified for the job and at the administration for even thinkingabout sending his name. Why?   In part because that's what they believed. But Senate RepublicanLeader Bob Dole of Kansas offered an alternate explanation. TheDemocrats, he said, just created an opportunity to say ``I told youso'' to the president if Ryan doesn't work out.   ``I have a sneaking suspicion that much of this debate is notreally about Tim Ryan,'' Dole said. ``It may be an exercise inpolitical self-protection, and it may be about writing the openingchapter in who is really to blame for the savings and loan mess.''   The Sandamp;L crisis was years in the making and the blame definitelyrests on both parties and on both the legislative and executivebranches of government. But Democrats are frustrated that the messhas left President Bush, and Ronald Reagan before him, politicallyunscathed.   This is especially distressing because of the ethicsinvestigation of four Democratic senators and one Republican whoreceived $1.3 million in campaign contributions from Charles H.Keating, the man at the center of the nation's worst thrift failure.   During his eight years in office, Reagan never mentioned thedeveloping problem. Bush has barely touched on the subject sincesigning the bailout law eight months ago.   ``Though the Congress is unquestionably the one that is writingthe laws ... this needs to be shared as well by the president,''said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.``In terms of the amount of money weare allocating to this bailout, President Bush deserves to be knownas the savings and loan president, not the education president, notthe clean air president.''   Slowly but surely that's happening. Bush has had to put theadministration solidly behind Ryan, who will have the thankless jobof deciding which Sandamp;Ls are strong enough to survive and which mustsurrender to government control.   Bush also will be confronting the dilemma of finding more moneyfor the problem. On Friday, a report from congressional auditorsmade it clear the need for more dollars will be soon.   Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general of the GeneralAccounting Office, increased the agency's estimate of the crisis'cost from $257 billion to at least $325 billion. He said it couldeasily top $400 billion and may hit $500 billion in the economyfalters.   Bush's 1991 budget, through various budget gimmickry, earmarksonly $7.3 billion for Sandamp;Ls. Recognizing reality as described by theGAO means Bush's budget deficit projection would have to zoom.   ``The administration ... seems to have felt the job was done theday the bill was signed. Actually the job just began,'' said Rep.Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking Committee.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Dave Skidmore has covered the savings and loancrisis for The Associated Press since 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
