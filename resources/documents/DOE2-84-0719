Wheneverfossil fuels containing sulfur are fired in heater or boilers, sulfurdioxide, and to a small extent sulfur trioxide, are formed in additionto CO/sub 2/ and water vapor. The SO/sub 3/ combines with water vaporin the flue gas to form sulfuric acid and condenses on heat transfersurfaces, which could lead to corrosion and destruction of the surfaces.This condensation occurs on surfaces that are at or below the dew pointof the acid gas. Also, when cooled below the water vapor dew point, CO/sub2/ can combine with water vapor to form carbonic acid, which though weak,can attack mild steel. While thermal efficiency of the equipment is increasedwith reduction in exit gas temperature (or enthalpy), lower temperaturesthan the acid gas dew point are not advisable for metallic surfaces incontact with the gas. In municipal solid waste fired plants, in additionto sulfuric acid, one has to deal with hydrochloric and hydrobromic acidformation. This article deals with methods for solving cold, or backend corrosion as it is called, with the most commonly used heat recoveryequipment, namely economizers or water heaters. These are used to preheatfeed water entering the system and operate at low metal temperatures,thereby increasing their susceptibility to corrosion by sulfuric, hydrochloric,hydrobromic and carbonic acid.</TEXT></DOC>
