The Impact-7000integrated mask processing advanced cluster equipment can measurecritical-dimension locations on the photomask from behind theglass, with accuracy of 0.0003 micron.andP;  The equipment aligns,locates, and measures automatically, reportedly making it muchmore accurate than products currently in use.andP;  The Impact-7000 isintended to reduce human error and lower costs by replacing somehuman labor.andP;  The system measures about 10 masks per hour.andO;Photronics will use the equipment to support a reticle-engravingsystem, and perhaps to work on optically-generated photomasks.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Photronics Inc.
