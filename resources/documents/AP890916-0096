(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After months of delicately dancing aroundquestions about race, Virginia's candidates for governor suddenlywere confronted by the issue with the Labor Day rioting by blacks inVirginia Beach.   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder and Republican J. Marshall Coleman,though, have stuck to their caution steps.   Wilder, seeking to become the first elected black governor of aU.S. state, distanced himself last week from any appearance of beingsympathetic to the unrest and claims by black leaders of policemisconduct in quelling the violence.   Coleman, who has said he will not let Wilder use race as a shieldto avoid tough questions, has been careful on his part to avoid anycomment that could be construed as racially inflammatory.   The rioting Sept. 3 and 4 coincided with a fraternity festivalthat annually draws thousands of students from predominantly blackcolleges along the East Coast to the resort city.   Rioters looted more than 100 businesses, and police arrestedabout 220 people. Afterward, many of the students visiting the beachcomplained that they were harassed by police and sometimes beaten asauthorities imposed a curfew after the looting and tried to clearthe ocean-front strip.   The state NAACP chapter has asked Gov. Gerald L. Baliles toappoint a commission to conduct a state investigation. The U.S.Justice Department and the FBI are already reviewing the matter.   ``Violence of this type _ of any type _ will not be condoned ortolerated while Doug Wilder is governor,'' Wilder said Monday in avisit to Norfolk, just a few miles from Virginia Beach. ``I willtake whatever measures are necessary to enforce this promise.''   Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor, has been fightingRepublican efforts to make him appear soft on crime. He made nomention of the allegations against police.   Instead, he supported Baliles, a fellow Democrat who by lawcannot run for a second consecutive term, in calling out statepolice and National Guard troops as backups for Virginia Beachofficers during the rioting.   Wilder ``is trying to be fair,'' said Laura Dillard, his presssecretary. He steered clear of the complaints against police``because it is still under investigation,'' she said.   Coleman, a one-time moderate from the Shenandoah Valley whose1989 campaign has taken on a more conservative slant, also calledBaliles' response ``necessary and appropriate under thecircumstances.''   ``Such lawlessness can never be justified or condoned,'' Colemansaid, adding that he saw nothing racial about the episode.   ``Given the volatility of the situation and the intenseemotionalism that surrounds it, it is absolutely essential thatpublic officials and private citizens refrain from politicizing thisregrettable incident,'' he said.   Polls show the two sides about even.   In 1977, when Coleman won the race for attorney general, hereceived substantial support from black voters.   But Wilder is expected to draw 90 percent or more of the state'sminority vote this year, partly because he is black and partlybecause Coleman does not have the advantage, as he did 12 years ago,of having a former segregationist as an opponent.   Wilder's law-and-order comments apparently have not hurt hisstanding among blacks, who comprise 17 percent of the state'spopulation.   ``What he's saying is consistent with what the NAACP has beensaying,'' said Jack W. Gravely, president of the Virginia chapter ofthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.   ``We have condemned the looting. We have condemned the violationof the law,'' Gravely said. ``We don't feel he's turning his back onus.''   Patrick Buchanan, a conservative newspaper columnist and one-timeaide to former President Reagan, sees the Virginia Beach rioting asdamaging to Wilder.   ``I think this racial violence in Virginia Beach and the factthat it's been nationalized by the TV media are really going tofinish him off in Virginia,'' Buchanan said on a syndicatedtelevision program last week.   However, Tom Morris, a University of Richmond political analyst,said neither side can do anything to turn the event to hisadvantage, particularly Coleman.   ``But it was unfortunate for Wilder, because it's a reminder thatthere are racial tensions in our society lurking below the surfaceand they can break through at any time,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
