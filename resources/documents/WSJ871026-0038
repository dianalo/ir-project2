But progress also has made the volatility worse.    That's the view of analysts, brokers and traders after the most turbulent week in recent memory in London financial markets. Big Bang, whose first anniversary is tomorrow, ended fixed trading commissions and barriers between agent brokers and risk-taking market makers.    The removal of such anti-competitive restrictions improved efficiency, and led to an influx of new, better-capitalized securities houses into the stock market.    The bolstered market structure and greater liquidity may have averted disaster last week, as record volumes and unheard-of volatility wracked the market.    &quot;There's no way under the old system that we could have coped with a doubling of volume they way we did this (past) week,&quot; said Alan Bartlett, deputy managing director of the securities unit of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, a securities and investment-banking concern.    &quot;It's extremely unlikely that any major market maker will fail,&quot; he added, suggesting that the casualties would have been greater if last week's shakeout had happened before Big Bang.    London &quot;stood up better than it ever could have a year ago,&quot; added David Neeson, managing director of international equities at Morgan Stanley International, a London securities unit of U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;As a whole, the market is in better shape by having introduced more and better-capitalized players, and by introducing more visibility into the system.&quot;    But while London clearly has been buttressed by deregulation, last week's trading hurt some firms. Already bruised by increased competition and lower commission rates in the past year, some firms appear to be facing significant losses in the value of their trading books because of last week's turbulence.    Smaller, less-capitalized stockbrokers probably are facing the biggest problems, analysts say.    In back offices, the trading-volume boom will exacerbate the settlements backlog, already running at an estimated #6 billion ($9.88 billion). Most important, no one yet knows how many clients will fail to pay brokers by next Monday, the final date for meeting trading obligations for last week's trading.    The exchange, mindful of this, last week made several public announcements about its confidence in the capital positions of member firms, verified by beefed-up daily checks from the exchange's surveillance unit. The stock exchange chairman, Sir Nicholas Goodison, said Friday that he saw &quot;no reason to suspect&quot; any firm might collapse under the weight of unsettled trades.    Nevertheless, a senior exchange official acknowledged no one will really know about the status of some firms until accounts are settled next week.    Such factors are likely to increase pressure on margins, which already has caused layoffs at some securities firms.    &quot;Markets like last week tend to concentrate the mind,&quot; said a senior official at London's stock exchange. &quot;Anyone who was thinking he was overstaffed before last week probably has had his mind concentrated wonderfully.&quot;    The market's biggest test was handling the surge in volume. The computer hardware installed during the past year was strained, traders say, but performed reasonably well.    Volume on London's stock exchange hit a record last Tuesday, when #3.5 billion in equities traded hands, compared with an average daily volume of #2.5 billion, and #643 million daily before Big Bang. Volume on Wednesday and Thursday was close to Tuesday's record.    Volume was lighter Friday. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index fell 38 points to 1795.2, well above its intraday low. The Financial Times 30-share index closed 38.5 points lower at 1396.8. Volume was 776 million shares, down from 914.6 million shares Thursday.    Dealers said shares were pushed to their lows in the morning on anticipation that Wall Street would open weaker after the Friday plunge in Tokyo share prices. But stocks fared better at the New York opening than traders expected.    Also, news that Britain's current account and merchandise trade deficits were much narrower than expected sparked a brief rally that lifted the Financial Times 100 index about 40 points above its lows before running out of steam as some participants used the rise as an opportunity to sell.    Earlier in the week, as the market tumbled and volume soared, some of the biggest complaints were from frantic investors who said traders weren't answering phones. Accurate estimates of the scope of this problem are impossible to find, with the exchange acknowledging only that it has received &quot;some&quot; complaints. But most observers agree it has been aggravated by the growth of electronic trading.    Before Big Bang, when trading was still based on the floor of London's exchange, &quot;you couldn't run away when things went wrong,&quot; said an analyst at a big U.S. securities house here. Now, &quot;you can effectively run away by not answering the phone.&quot; That contributes to volatility, he said, because &quot;by not giving a price, the price just falls further.&quot;    Some private investors clearly suffered. In a letter to London's Financial Times newspaper Saturday, investor Peter Arbuthnot complained of being charged premium prices, when market makers could be reached to trade at all.    &quot;On the old-style stock exchange, jobbers (traders) faced the howling pack bravely,&quot; wrote Mr. Arbuthnot. &quot;Today, mesmerized by their TV screens, market makers can cower behind the endlessly ringing telephone. An improved service for clients? I wonder.&quot;    The greater share-price volatility is a result of the post-Big Bang trading system, says Ian Harwood, an economist at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co., a securities and investment house in London.    &quot;In the old days, there weren't so many firms, everybody knew what everyone else was doing and trading was in a much more confined space,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, there are more firms, not all in the same place, trading on screens and telephones with much more information. That in itself makes for volatility.&quot;    Such volatility also spreads to other markets.    &quot;These markets are so interlinked, whatever happens in one has effects,&quot; said David Walton, a London-based economist at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., the investment-banking and securities concern.    In Continental European equities, for example, some London firms reported a doubling of volume as trading restrictions on the Continent sent investors scrambling for an open market. London had longer trading hours in German equities than Frankfurt last week, said a British broker.    &quot;The Germans have been slow to start and quick to finish,&quot; he added. Others reported a sharp increase in French and Scandinavian equity trading.    Volatility also had an effect on the London-based Euromarkets. On Friday, Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd. withdrew a 1 billion Australian dollars ($765 million) Euro-convertible equity offering for Bell Resources Ltd. because of &quot;unprecedented volatility and adverse changes in world financial market conditions.&quot;    However, unlike major markets in the U.S. and elsewhere, London's exchange has decided against restricting trading hours to help firms catch up with backlogs. Such actions, the exchange said, wouldn't &quot;have significant effect on volume or the settlement backlog.&quot;    In Saturday trading in Tokyo, stocks rebounded somewhat -- rising 97.56 points, to close at 23298.78 -- after posting the second-largest drop on record in Friday's trading. Friday, the Nikkei average plummeted 1203.23 points, second only to last Tuesday's 3836.48-point decline.    The Osaka Stock Exchange, the second largest in Japan, fared no better Friday. The main index there also registered its second-largest drop.    Traders said Wall Street's sharp drop Thursday shook investor confidence in Tokyo and Osaka and sent prices into the tailspin.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei average slid 949.41 points on light volume, closing the session at 22349.37.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed broadly mixed with an upward bias after nervous trading Friday, brokers said. Some automobile shares registered gains, while losses were restricted mainly to bank stocks. In other sectors, shares seldom gained or lost more than five marks each.    Stocks were also mixed in Amsterdam and Stockholm. Shares finished lower in Sydney, Singapore, Paris, Zurich, Brussels and Milan.
