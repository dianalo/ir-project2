 Two such products areUltraLock and FastLock.andM;UltraLockandM;The security system provided by UltraLock involves the encryption anddecryption of individual files as they|re read from or written to disk usinga proprietary patented algorithm.andP;  The nucleus of the system is a 22Kbsection of memory-resident code which transparently proceses the filesaccording to a list of supplied file specifications and security keys.andO;Attempts to use a protected file without the correct key result in a totallyunusable copy being read from the disk.andM;Other utilities are supplied to erase the current keys, to show which filesare currently being protected (to verify that any scheme implemented isworking as planned) and to temporarily load another set of keys so thatanother user could, for example, hop on to a machine, grab a file and thendisappear without disturbing the current file and key lists.andM;Setting up the software looks daunting because its flexibility allows quitecomplex security structures ot be set up.andP;  Keys can be split so that only onehalf is known to any one person, with the remainder being supplied, forexample, by a supervisor.andP;  In practice, the system can be as simple orcomplex as desired by individual users.andM;The basic protections scheme involves manually typing the specifications andtheir keys using the Setkey software.andP;  Once input, the key list can't beviewed, so it's important to ensure that everything is typed carefully; ifthe key entered at a later date differs from the original the matching fileswon't decrypt as expected.andP;  Indvidual keys can be made to echo on the screenas they are input and this may help during initial trials.andM;To avoid any unnecessary typing, the file and key information can also be putinto a text file to be read by the software.andP;  Naturally, this list can alsobe protected by its own key to avoid prying eyes?andP;  The manual supplied withthe software shows how various features of Setkey may be combined to producequite complex multiuser protection systems with different levels of accessand a mix of global and private keys.andP;  New files cna inherit keys based uponthose previously entered for their home directory.andM;Installation is straightforward, but the manual does require thorough readingto appreciate the power of the package.andP;  It contains important informationregarding potential problems with certain DOS commands, programs thatgenerate temporary files and it explains what can happen if you get toocarried away with wildcards?andM;UltraLock appeared totally transparent to a wide variety of packages,including Wordperfect 5.0, Windows 286, Splash!M the VGA paint package, andTurbo Pascal.andP;  Its effects on disk throughput can be a bit more noticeable:experiments on a 12MHz AT (Olivetti M280) with SCSI drive show that theencryption/decryption can add considerable delays to read/write operations(see table 1).andP;  These delays will obviously have to be balanced against thesecurity benefits.andM;Try ing to hack UltraLock was enjoyable but fruitless.andP;  Protected files areeasily read and copied but, of course, the information they contain istotally scrambled.andP;  Delving deeper, armed with an array of memory-probingutilities, it didn't take too long to find the location where the residentcode stored the file and key lists.andP;  The file specification part was instraight ASCII, so it was easy to discover which files were being protected.andO;The key list was, however, sensible encrypted, making it impossible to findout how they were being processed.andM;The software developer, Business Simulations, offers an ad hoc, chargeablerecovery service for users who forget a password, but the recovery process isapparently  known to only one person in the company (let's hope he doesn't gosick) Furthermore, the encryption algorithm is apparently so high-tech anduncrackable that an export licence is required to take the software out ofthe country.andM;UltraLock is certainly a slick package and would be ideal in all but thehighest-security shared PC environment.andP;  The only drawback is that althoughit permits secured, shared access, it can't do anything to stop usersaccidentally or deliberately encrypting another person's files.andP;  This willput even greater emphasis on the importance of regular (encode) backups beingkept safely for a machine with UltraLock installed.andM;FastLockandM;FastLock's method of operation is quite different from that of UltraLock, inthat it doesn't encrypt files but denies access to the bootable partition ofthe hard disk unless the correct password is supplied.andP;  This makes FastLockmuch easier to implement, but it also makes it unsuitable for shared machinesbecause a single password grants everyone access.andP;  The only way to secure themachine from outsdiers is to keep 'locking' it and rebooting after each userhas completed their tasks -- something which would soon be forgotten in abusy office.andM;Two disks are supplied with the package -- a 3-1/2-inch and 5-1/4-inch --containing a README file with update information and the program itself.andO;Locking the hard disk just requires the FL.EXE program to be run and then apassword supplied and retyped for verification.andP;  If all is well, the programgoes to work examining the hard disk and patching the boot code.andP;  If, duringthe locking phase, FastLock doesn't like the configuration of the hard disk-- either a non-standard format or partition size -- then it will abandon thetask with a suitable message.andP;  The program will also park the heads unlesstold otherwise, as well as locking the hard disk -- that's a nice touch.andM;In the best traditions of a PC User reviewer, I volunteered my own PC -- anOlivetti M280 with a 64Mb SCSI drive in two 32Mb partitions -- to be firstfor the FastLock treatment (after backing up all important data).andO;Installation was quite painless; after verifying my password, the lockingproces took about three seconds and I was then prompted to switch off orreboot.andP;  After resetting the machine, all was normal except that the usualboot process had been replaced by a technicolor message asking for mypassword.andP;  As soon as this was entered, the machine reset itself again butthis time booted normally.andP;  The software was also tested on a variety ofTandon and Toshiba machines, including the new Tandon 386-33 with a 300Mbhard disk.andP;  In each case, the software locked and unlocked the hard diskswithout any problems.andM;FastLock initially allows three attempts at entering the correct password.andO;If it's still not entered correctly after the third attempt, the PC emits themost raucous noise from its speaker for about 10 seconds after everysubsequent wrong entry.andP;  In any event, the number of incorrect attempts isdutifully reported as soon as a 'legitimate' user gains proper access.andP;  Ifthe correct password is completely forgotten, the authors, Rupp Corporation,offer a recovery service but this isn't available via the UK distributors --users will have to approach Rupp in the US directly.andM;Attacking the lock using all methods readily to hand proved fruitless.andP;  Ifthe machine was booted from floppy, then drive C (and logical drive D) became'invalid'.andP;  File Rescue Plus, Norton's Advanced Utilities and a few 'trade'software tools wouldn't touch the drive either.andP;  Re-installing the standardboot code using the DOS SYS command also failed.andM;Turning to the FL.EXE program itself, a quick glance through the coderevealed that the locking process involved copying the standard boot codeonto an unused section of the hard disk and replacing it with FastLock's ownboot code.andP;  In addition, Both File Allocation tables (which are used to keeptrack of where on the disk each part of a file has been stored) are alsomoved and possibly encrypted to ensure that, even if someone did manage toaccess the drive, it would be extremely difficult to piece togetherindividual files.andM;From my limited investigation, I can foresee that it would be possible for areally determined hacker with a fair degree of programming skills toeventually gain access to a locked hard disk though, with no valid FATs toguide them, it would be difficult to copy off individual programs.andP;  It would,however, be relatively easy (although time-consuming) to lift chunks of ASCIIcode and perhaps 'stick' together a document or a program source code file.andO;However, as a product which promotes itself as offering a 'medium level ofsecurity', FastLock does its duty very well and will easily deter all but theprofessional software thief.andM;USER VERDICTandM;* PRODUCT NAME FastLock.andM;* SUPPLIER Software Paradise Limited, 2 Clive Chambers, Clive Street,Caerphilly, Mid-Glamorgan, Wales CF8 1GE.andP;
