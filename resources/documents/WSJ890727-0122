Terms weren't disclosed, but it is understood the purchase price would approach $150 million.    The sale is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission. The agency required Beatrice's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., to sell certain businesses as part of an agreement allowing it to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. last fall. RJR Nabisco owns Planters, the leading brand with 50% of the salted-nut business.    The Cincinnati consumer products concern quietly had expressed interest in buying Planters, but settled for No. 2 Fisher, which has an estimated 11% of the salted-nut market.    The proposed purchase met with mixed reaction from analysts, largely because Pandamp;G has a spotty record in the food business. &quot;Once again, they're the David going after Goliath,&quot; said Lynne Hyman, analyst with First Boston Corp.    In potato chips, for instance, Pandamp;G's Pringle's brand trails Frito-Lay's chips, while its Citrus Hill orange juice lags in third place behind Tropicana and Minute Maid.    But the purchase would offer some synergies for Pandamp;G, which already buys peanuts for its Jif peanut butter. The Fisher unit, which has a variety of peanuts, cashews and other nuts, has annual sales of about $100 million, analysts said.    Pandamp;G is expected to bolster the Fisher brand by increasing distribution of the products. Only half of the U.S. retail outlets now carry the Fisher line, analysts said.    Pandamp;G's snack food business could also benefit should its fat substitute, olestra, get Food and Drug Administration approval. In a recent interview, John G. Smale, chairman and chief executive officer of Pandamp;G, said he considered the fat substitute category to be a &quot;multibillion-dollar market.&quot;    Mr. Smale wouldn't predict when the FDA will rule on Pandamp;G's petition for approval of olestra, but he said Pandamp;G scientists have &quot;almost total confidence that approval will come.&quot; He added: &quot;They are less willing to predict when it's going to come.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
