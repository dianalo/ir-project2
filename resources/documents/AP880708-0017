A slew of streets have been shut down for the ninth MontrealInternational Jazz Festival, a 10-day blowout expected to attract arecord 600,000 people by the time a Louisiana bayou blues band laysdown the final riffs early Monday.   With a roster ranging from Miles Davis to Manhattan Transfer,the festival, which began last Friday, has transformed the towninto a musical mecca.   Under the cast-iron balconies of gabled houses on Rue St-Denis,buskers, acrobats and bongo players entertain between bandstandsand the snap of bebop trumpets emerges from crowded cafes.   A few blocks away, 60,000 listeners packed Place des Artsearlier this week to hear white South African singer Johnny Cleggand his integrated band Savuka deliver their soulful anti-apartheidmessage.   Organizers of the non-profit $3.5 million festival also staged aCuban night featuring keyboard prodigy Gonzalo Rubalcaba; theCanadian debut of Mamma Tongue, a Gambian-American band mixingAfrica oral tradition with jazz; and an inspired double bill ofpianist Dorothy Donegan and alto sax star Phil Woods that caused ahappy riot.   After many encores, an exhausted Donegan quipped: ``Did I getthe job?''   Guitarist Pat Metheny, a guest at eight of the nine Montrealgatherings, was dubbed the festival's patron saint and appointedjudge of a Canadian jazz band contest.   ``It's the best fest going,'' Metheny told a news conference.``I don't think there's anything that can compare. It's such agreat town and a great setting, especially with the wholeenvironment of closing off the streets.''   George Wein, who once ran the Newport Jazz Festival, has calledMontreal the most complete and best-organized jazz festival in theworld _ aided by $415,000 in government grants.   With its gallic atmosphere and European sophistication, Montrealhas always been hip to jazz _ it's the hometown of Oscar Peterson.   A recent influx of Third World immigrants has rejuvenated andbroadened the tradition.   ``Within the heart of the city you have French, English, Cubans,Puerto Ricans, Irish _ it's so culturally varied,'' said strollingmusician Jeremy Dunlop who arrived from Jamaica 13 years ago and issitting in on the deep-barrelled African djembe drum whenever aband offers an invitation.   Miles Davis contributed not only the festival's opening nighthighlight on Friday, he drew a self-portrait in pastels that becamethe official poster and made its way onto stage backdrops andT-shirts.   Although afficionados paid up to $24.50 to hear Davis, DizzyGillespie, Ornette Coleman and Robert Cray, the heart of thefestival is the 250 free concerts in the open air, plus fivemarching bands.   Festival president Alain Simard defends his decision to invitereggae star Jimmy Cliff, blues singer Etta James, Senegalesesensation Youssou N'Dour and other acts outside the realms oftraditional jazz.   ``We don't have a dogmatic vision of jazz. It's not something toput in a museum. Lately, jazz has been very influenced by Latin andAfrican music,'' Simard said in an interview.   He said musicians tell each other about Montreal and it's neverany problem booking acts. ``In nine years we've not had acancellation.   ``People feel secure here, even at late hours out in thestreets. It probably couldn't happen in New York.''</TEXT></DOC>
