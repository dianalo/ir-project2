Diplomats in Rangoon said they feared the move could prompt anew clampdown by the government.   The dissidents, calling themselves the National CoalitionGovernment of the Union of Burma, said they had picked Sein Win asprime minister.   He is a cousin of Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader whoseNational League for Democracy won 80 percent of the parliamentaryseats contested in May's national election.   The opposition leader has been under house arrest since July1989, and her party has not been allowed to govern. On Tuesday,U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar urged the Burmesegovernment to release her.   The military government said Wednesday night it would free Ms.Suu Kyi only if she left Burma to join her family in Britain. Itsreply to Perez de Cuellar came in a Foreign Ministry statementcarried by state radio.   Most of the party's leaders have been detained since the armytook power by crushing a nationwide movement for democracy in 1988.   Sein Win said forming the new body ``was the only option for usto choose because this military junta has no will and no way totransfer power to the people.''   The announcement of the formation of a new government was madeat the headquarters of the Karen National Union in Manerplaw, about120 miles northeast of Rangoon on the frontier with Thailand. TheKaren are an ethnic rebel group that has fought successivegovernments in Rangoon since the 1940s.   The dissidents named an eight-member Cabinet, all of whom hadwon parliamentary seats in the election. Six are League members andone is an independent. Sein Win is a member of the closely alliedNational Democracy Party.   All had fled under threat of arrest when their plan to form aparallel government became known to the Rangoon government. Themilitary government said earlier this month it had arrested 48members of the National League for Democracy for involvement in theplan.   Diplomats from Rangoon have said the figure could be higher.   The dissidents called for the immediate elimination of themilitary administration, a national convention including members ofparliament and insurgent groups, and the establishment of ademocratic government.   Their goal, they said, was to create ``an independent,prosperous and modernized Federal Union of Burma.''   Troops killed thousands of people crushing the pro-democracymovement in 1988. Amnesty International and other human rightsgroups say hundreds and perhaps thousands of dissidents have sincebeen detained without charge or trial or sentenced to prison termsafter unfair military trials.   Amnesty has cited numerous reports of routine torture ofdissidents, particularly of members of insurgent groups.   A Rangoon-based diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Tuesday the declaration of a rival government could give themilitary an excuse to intensify its crackdown on the opposition. Hesaid it might even provide a pretext for it to declare the NationalLeague for Democracy illegal.   A powerful member of the Rangoon government warned in newspaperinterview published Tuesday that the declaration would be ``a greatmistake.''   Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, Burma's head of military intelligence,told the Bangkok Post the existing government was recognized by theUnited Nations and he did not believe that any country wouldrecognize a government-in-exile.   Western diplomats expressed doubt that the breakaway group wouldgarner much popular support inside Burma. The Democratic Allianceof Burma, an umbrella organization of 21 ethnic and other rebelgroups fighting the central government, backed the declaration. TheKaren are members of the DAB.</TEXT></DOC>
