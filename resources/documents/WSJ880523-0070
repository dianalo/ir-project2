A survey released this month of projected enrollments estimates that the state's high schools will graduate nearly a third fewer students by the year 2004.    High-school enrollment nationwide has been on a roller-coaster ride, giving school planners fits. The number of high-school graduates peaked in 1979, declined through the mid-1980s, and turned up slightly the past couple of years. Another major slump is expected in 1989 but will bottom out in the mid-1990s and then recover strongly just past the year 2000. The ups and downs reflect fluctuations in the U.S. birth rate and the influx of immigrant groups who favor large families.    The study by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, Boulder, Colo., and the College Board, New York, relies on population trends but doesn't try to forecast state economic conditions, which can cause sharp population swings.    The study says Nevada's high-school graduates will more than double by 2004. Graduates in California and Florida will increase by nearly two-thirds. Iowa, Illinois and Massachusetts face sharply fewer graduates.    ---                 State of Graduates   Projected change in numbers of public and private high school graduates between 1986 and 2004                     BIGGEST GAINS           Nevada           9,600     109%           Arizon          22,500      79           California     158,100      63           Florida         58,600      63           Washington      18,400      38                      LARGEST LOSSES           Virginia         7,100      31%           Iowa             9,100      24           Illinois        20,800      16           Massachusetts    8,800      12           Pennslyvania    15,600      11   Sources: Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education; The College Board.   If You Can't Beat Them,   Change the Rules   CARBONDALE, ILL., news paper publisher W. Stephen Burgess says: &quot;If you aren't in those books, you don't exist.&quot;   He's speaking of the bibles of the advertising, media and sales industries -- such as Newspaper Rates and Data, and Survey of Buying Power -- that list income and demographic data for metropolitan areas. Because Carbondale doesn't meet the complex federal definition of a metro area, it isn't on these lists. And as a result, Mr. Burgess says, his newspaper, the Southern Illinoisan, has a tough time catching the attention of national advertisers.   The solution? Become a metro area by act of Congress. At the behest of the city's boosters, Rep. Kenneth Gray (D., Ill.) introduced a bill naming the county that includes Carbondale and two adjacent counties as one Metropolitan Statistical Area. Though Carbondale has just 26,000 residents -- including 12,000 Southern Illinois University students -- the combined counties have more than 100,000 residents, one of the benchmarks of a metro area.   Two other areas, Harvey County, Kan., and a two-county region including Decatur, Ala., have achieved the status by congressional fiat since 1986. The tinkering disturbs statisticians, though, who say it makes all metro area figures suspect.   If the Carbondale bill is approved, it could be a shallow victory. Survey of Buying Power, a widely used sales and media guide, will stop listing metro areas that don't meet the government's traditional definition. &quot;We're seeing statistics used in an improper way for private gain. It's a subtle form of pork barrel,&quot; says Edward Spar, vice president of Bill Communications, New York, the survey's publisher.   Census Won't List   Various Asian Groups   CALIFORNIA congressman Robert Matsui appears to have lost a battle with the Census Bureau over how the nation's fast-growing Asian population will be counted.   Rep. Matsui wants the 1990 census form's question on racial identity to contain a list of at least 11 Asian groups: Japanese, Korean, Hawaiian, Chinese and Samoan, for instance. Ethnic Asians would be asked to check one of the categories, or an additional line marked &quot;other.&quot; A similar question was on the 1980 census.   But the Census Bureau, citing space problems, has decided on a single fill-in-the-blank question, requiring Asians and Pacific Islanders to write in their ethnic identification. Paula Schneider, chief of the bureau's population division, says that in several field tests the write-in question resulted in more accurate data than the check-off method. Rep. Matsui, however, says many immigrants with poor English skills won't fill in the blank correctly.   The Office of Management and Budget -- which has final say on census matters, barring congressional override -- is expected to side with the bureau.   As a compromise, though, Ms. Schneider says the 1990 census will include far more detailed information on Asian groups than previous censuses, and the figures will be rushed out by the spring of 1991. After the 1980 census, it took until the mid-1980s before all the data on Asians were released.   Odds and Ends   SUN BELT inflation: Arizona's purchasing managers report that the rate of price increases last month was the state's second highest for any month in the past seven years. . . . So far this year, the Centers for Disease Control has identified 192 animal rabies cases in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia -- making it the region with the highest incidence of rabies in the U.S. . . . High-density bureaucrats: Alaska, New York, and Wyoming have more than 600 federal, state and local government employees per 10,000 population, the Census Bureau says.</TEXT></DOC>
