The standards proposed for revision regulatethe design, availability, and use of personal protective equipment in shipyards.The existing shipyard employment standards (29 CFR Part 1915) apply toshipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking operations and related employments.However, the present standards in Part 1915 are not comprehensive in theircoverage of shipyard hazards, and are supplemented by the general industrystandards (29 CFR Part 1910) as necessary to provide complete coveragefor all the hazards encountered in shipyards. This document is one of aseries of proposals which are intended to revise Part 1915 to provide comprehensivecoverage of shipyard employment solely within that part. This action would consolidate, reorganize, and update the shipyard personalprotective equipment standards and the appropriate general industry personalprotective equipment standards into a single, comprehensive Part 1915 thatwould apply to all activities and areas in shipyards (except constructionactivities covered by Part 1926). The proposal would, where appropriate,delete existing specification provisions which currently limit employerinnovation and use performance-oriented provisions to address the hazardsof falling or being struck by falling or flying objects. The proposal wouldalso add criteria for personal fall protective equipment which are notcurrently set forth in either Part 1910 or Part 1915. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments on this proposed rulemaking must be postmarkedby February 27, 1989.

Pierce, Office of Fire ProtectionEngineering and Systems Safety Standards, Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background and Approach</ITAG>In May 1971, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under authoritygranted by section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970(29 U.S.C. 655), adopted established Federal standards issued under section41 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 941),as standards applicable to ship repairing (29 CFR Part 1915), shipbuilding(29 CFR Part 1916), and shipbreaking (29 CFR Part 1917) operations. Inaddition, OSHA adopted other Federal standards and national consensus standardsas general industry standards (29 CFR Part 1910) and construction industrystandards (29 CFR Part 1926) which were made applicable to hazards andworking conditions not specifically covered by Parts 1915, 1916, or 1917.On April 20, 1982, the ship repairing, shipbuilding, and shipbreaking standardswere consolidated into one Part 1915 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations,and titled ``Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Shipyard Employment''(47 FR 16984). The consolidation eliminated duplicate provisions and overlappingprovisions, but did not alter substantive requirements. The consolidationdid not affect the applicability of general industry standards in 29 CFRPart 1910 to hazards or conditions in shipyard employments not specificallyaddressed in the consolidated Part 1915 (See 29 CFR 1910.5(c)(2)). In 1982, the Shipbuilders Council of America and the American WaterwaysShipyard Conference requested OSHA to identify the specific applicableprovisions of the general industry standards which apply to shipyards,and consolidate them with the existing Part 1915 provisions into a singleset of shipyard employment standards. OSHA has determined that such consolidationis appropriate. This and other proposed rulemakings will eventually incorporateall applicable Part 1910 provisions into the existing organization of Part1915. The present Part 1915 organizational format, which is already familiarto present users of the shipyard standards, provides a logical groupingof related provisions based on the type of work activity, hazard, or equipmentinvolved. However, when a regrouping of topics would facilitate understandingof the rules, or when existing Part 1910 provisions have no counterpartin the existing Part 1915 structure, the proposals would create new subpartsor subpart headings in Part 1915. In addition to consolidating the provisions of Part 1910 and Part 1915,OSHA proposes to revise the consolidated provisions as appropriate. OSHAhas not substantively revised many of the current provisions in these partssince they were promulgated in 1971. OSHA believes that some provisionsneed to be revised to reflect technological advances. Other provisionsneed to be revised because they are based on national consensus standardsissued prior to 1971, and do not reflect the revisions made since thattime. As the provisions are consolidated, all such revised consensus standardswill be reviewed, and OSHA's provisions revised as necessary to effectuatethe purposes of the standard and the OSH Act. Where practical, all currentincorporations by reference of national consensus standards will be updatedto reference the most current national consensus standards for the <T3>design</T3> of personal protective equipment (PPE). Requirements forthe selection, care and use of, and training in, PPE will be proposed forinclusion in the body of the proposed standard. This approach is intendedto assist employers in determining what duties and obligations are imposedby a provision by minimizing the need to refer to documents outside Part1915, except for the design requirements for PPE, which are normally notused by employers or employees, but rather by manufacturers of PPE. OSHAwill also use the consolidation project to replace specification requirementswith performance-oriented requirements where it is known that there ismore than one way to provide safety equivalent to that provided by thepresent specification requirements. Specification requirements would beused only where necessary to set appropriate limits and to clarify dutiesand obligations. The revision of the shipyard employment standards will be coordinated withefforts to revise parallel provisions in the construction and general industrystandards so that consistent coverage of hazards which are encounteredin these industry sectors can be provided. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary and Explanation of the Proposal</ITAG>The current standards for shipyard personnel protective equipment, 29 CFRPart 1915, Subpart I, apply to personal protective equipment used in shipyardworkplaces and operations, including shipbuilding, ship repairing and shipbreaking.Those standards, however, are not comprehensive. They must be supplementedby general industry standards in Part 1910, Subpart I, in areas, such asthe design and use of personal protective equipment, which are not specificallyaddressed by the shipyard employment standards. OSHA believes that consolidatingall personal protective equipment standards applicable to shipyard employmentinto a single, comprehensive set of standards in Part 1915 will facilitateunderstanding of the rules and, as a result, provide at least as effective,if not improved, protection of shipyard employees exposed to respiratoryhazards, fall hazards and the hazards of being struck by falling or flyingobjects.OSHA proposes to revise Subpart I of 29 CFR Part 1915 to incorporate thoserequirements of 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart I, which OSHA has determinedare applicable to shipyard employment.The requirements of proposed Subpart I would apply to personal protectiveequipment (PPE) in shipyard workplaces and operations, including shipbuilding,ship repairing, and shipbreaking, except for construction work coveredby 29 CFR Part 1926. The proposal would consolidate the current PPE provisionsof Part 1915 with the applicable provisions of 29 CFR Part 1910, SubpartI, including all of andSection; 1910.134, Respiratory protection.At present, andSection; 1910.134 supplements the limited coverage of respiratoryprotection which is found in andSection; 1915.152 of the shipyard standards.The proposal would delete andSection; 1915.152 and apply andSection; 1910.134in its entirety to shipyard employment. Deletion of andSection; 1915.152will not substantively change the current respirator coverage for shipyards,since the requirements currently in that section are also found in andSection;1910.134.Although andSection; 1910.134 would continue to apply to shipyards underthe proposal, the substantive requirements for respiratory protection inshipyards are not open for revision as part of this rulemaking. As notedbelow, OSHA is aware that much of andSection; 1910.134 needs to be reexaminedin light of changes in technology and industrial hygiene practice whichhave occurred in recent years. Therefore, OSHA has prepared a separatedraft revision to andSection; 1910.134 which involves a highly complex rulemakingeffort that cuts across industry lines. Respiratory protection requirementsneed to be consistent to provide adequate protection whenever respiratorsare used. For the present, therefore, OSHA will continue to apply andSection;1910.134 to shipyards, pending the future rulemaking on that standard,which is expected to be proposed soon. When andSection; 1910.134 is promulgated,these revisions will be applicable to the shipyard standards. The Agency'sapproach to shipyard respiratory protection is explained further in thediscussion below of proposed andSection; 1915.154.OSHA also proposes to change the format of Part 1915, Subpart I, to accommodatethe consolidated 1910 and 1915 provisions. New section numbers and sectionheadings are proposed wherever it would facilitate understanding of therules, and where otherwise necessary to accommodate applicable provisionsof Part 1910 which have no counterpart in the existing structure of SubpartI, Part 1915. The revised format of Part 1915, Subpart I, would containthe following sections:andSection; 1915.151_Scope, application, and definitions applicable to thissubpart.andSection; 1915.152_General requirements.andSection; 1915.153_Eye and face protection.andSection; 1915.154_Respiratory protection.andSection; 1915.155_Head Protection.andSection; 1915.156_Foot protection.andSection; 1915.157_Hand and body protection.andSection; 1915.158_Lifesaving equipment.andSection; 1915.159_Personal fall protection equipment.The provisions of the current Subpart I standards, andSection;andSection; 1915.151through 1915.154, are being revised, supplemented and reorganized as setforth in the table which appears below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,s10,r10</C><H1>Current standard</H1><H1>Proposed standard</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(a)(1) <D>andSection; 1915.153(b)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(a)(2) <D>andSection; 1915.152(c)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(a)(3) <D>andSection; 1915.152(d)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(a)(4) <D>andSection; 1915.153(a)(4)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(b)(1) <D>andSection; 1915.153(a)(1)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(c)(1) <D>andSection; 1915.153 (a)(1), (a)(5)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(c)(2) <D>andSection; 1915.153(a)(5)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.151(c)(3) <D>andSection; 1915.153(a)(5)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.152 <D>andSection; 1915.154</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.153(a) <D>andSection; 1915.155(a)(1)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.153(b) <D>andSection; 1915.155 (a)(2), (b)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.153(c) <D>andSection; 1915.152(d)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.153(d) <D>andSection; 1915.152(a)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.153(e) <D>andSection; 1915.157(a)(2)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.153(f) <D>andSection; 1915.157(a)(1)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.154(a)(1) <D>andSection; 1915.158(a)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.154(a)(2) <D>andSection; 1915.158(c)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.154 (b)(1)-(b)(3) <D>andSection; 1915.159</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.154 (c)(1)-(c)(4) <D>andSection; 1915.158 (b)(1)-(b)(5)</D></ITAG></ITAG>In addition to these sections, OSHA proposes to add a non-mandatory AppendixA, which provides guidelines for designing and testing personal fall protectionequipment.This format change will necessitate the change of references to specificsections of current Subpart I, contained in Subparts C and H of the shipyardstandards, to the appropriate new sections of proposed Subpart I. Thesechanges of references, which are contained in this proposal, do not substantiallychange the requirements for the use of PPE in those subparts.Provisions of Parts 1910 and 1915 which OSHA believes unnecessarily restrictemployer innovation and the application of technological advances wouldbe revised into performance-oriented standards. These changes are discussedmore fully below.OSHA has used the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Injury Reports (WIR)on eye, face, foot and head injuries as a basis for determining the typeof PPE-related injuries that occur (References 24, 25, 26, 27). Althoughthese reports do not specifically include shipyard injuries, OSHA believesthat the WIR data are representative of the types of PPE-related incidentsin shipyards as well (See injury tables below. These tables are based onBLS surveys of injured workers, and do not reflect the universe of non-injuredworkers). This finding is supported by visits made by OSHA personnel toseveral shipyards in order to observe the use of personal protective equipment.The Agency has used the information gained from these visits and reportsto develop effective provisions for shipyards. In addition, many proposedsections adopt language from current ANSI personal protective equipmentstandards.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s200,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Eye Injuries By Type Of Accident, Selected States </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[July-August 1979]</ITAG><H1>Item</H1><H1>All workers (100%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Workers wearing eye protection (41%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>1,052</D><D>100</D><D>435</D><D>100</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flying or falling object struck you<D>727</D><D>69</D><D>355</D><D>82</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck non-moving object<D>21</D><D>2</D><D>5</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Liquid or chemical injured you<D>216</D><D>21</D><D>59</D><D>14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in another way<D>88</D><D>8</D><D>16</D><D>4</D><F>(Workers not wearing eye protection = 59 percent)</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_This table does not reflect workers whose eye protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7,7</C><T4>Face Injuries By Type Of Accident, Selected States</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[July-November 1979]</ITAG><H1>Item</H1><H1>Number of workers</H1><H1>Percent of workers</H1><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>774</D><D>100</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flying or falling objects struck you<D>344</D><D>44</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck non-moving object<D>48</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Liquid or chemical injured you<D>35</D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Swinging object struck face<D>154</D><D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Object or tool was pulled into face<D>114</D><D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Powered tool kicked back into face<D>33</D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in other way<D>46</D><D>6</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_This table does not reflect workers whose face protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s200,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Foot Injuries By Description Of Accident, Selected States </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[July-August 1979]</ITAG><H1>Item</H1><H1>All workers (100%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Workers wearing safety shoes (23%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>1,251</D><D>100</D><D>283</D><D>100</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Stepped on sharp object<D>194</D><D>16</D><D>24</D><D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck by falling object<D>721</D><D>58</D><D>191</D><D>67</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Object rolled onto or over foot<D>168</D><D>13</D><D>36</D><D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Squeezed between<D>59</D><D>5</D><D>13</D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck foot against object<D>28</D><D>2</D><D>3</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in another way<D>81</D><D>6</D><D>16</D><D>6</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_This table does not reflect workers whose foot protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s200,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Head Injuries By Description Of Accident, Selected States</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[July-September 1979]</ITAG><H1>Item</H1><H1>All workers (100%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Workers wearing hard hats (16%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>1,033</D><D>100</D><D>170</D><D>100</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Head struck non-moving object<D>299</D><D>29</D><D>21</D><D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Swinging object struck<D>198</D><D>19</D><D>44</D><D>26</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Falling object struck head<D>371</D><D>36</D><D>62</D><D>36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flying object struck head<D>120</D><D>12</D><D>34</D><D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in another way<D>45</D><D>4</D><D>9</D><D>5</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_This table does not reflect workers whose head protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG>The current standards in Part 1915 also incorporate various national consensusstandards by reference. OSHA proposes to update these incorporations byreference for the design requirements for PPE, and include the relevantrequirements and other information that is directly applicable to employersin these documents within the text of the revised standards. The provisionsaffected by these deletions, current paragraphs andSection;andSection; 1915.151(a)(1)and 1915.153(b), are discussed in more detail below. This approach wouldenable employers to determine what duties and obligations are imposed bypart 1915 without referring to documents outside Part 1915, except forthe design requirements for PPE, and in the case of respiratory protection.In accordance with paragraph 6(b)(8) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), the Agency has reviewed the various nationalconsensus standards that cover working conditions addressed in this proposal.OSHA has incorporated appropriate provisions from those national consensusstandards as part of this proposal. OSHA believes that the proposed standardwill better effectuate the purposes of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 than the national consensus standards which have not been madea part of this proposal, because this proposal is more comprehensive andprovides greater flexibility in its requirements for safety.The following discussion provides a more detailed explanation of the proposedprovisions related to personal protective equipment.Section 1915.151 Scope, application, and definitions applicable to thissubpart.Proposed paragraph (a) sets forth the scope and application of the proposal.This Subpart would apply to all personal protective equipment used in shipyardworkplaces and operations, except that used in construction work coveredby Part 1926. The personal protective equipment provisions of Subpart Iof Part 1910 would no longer apply unless specifically referenced.Proposed paragraph (b) defines key terms used in the proposed standard.While the proposed definitions are self-explanatory, several are discussedbelow to facilitate understanding of the fall protection provisions ofthis proposal.``Deceleration device'' is defined as a personal fall arrest system withcomponents which dissipate a substantial amount of energy during a fallarrest by means other than the simple stretching of a rope or line. Itincludes such devices as rope grabs, rip stitch lanyards, special wovenlanyards, and automatic-self retracting lifelines, and excludes rope, wire,chain or webbing lanyards.``Personal fall arrest system'' is defined as the system and componentsthat are used to arrest the fall of employees who have fallen from worksurfaces. This type of system differs from a positioning device systemin that the primary purpose of the personal fall arrest system is to <T3>arrest</T3> safely an employee who has fallen, while positioning devicesystems are used primarily to <T3>prevent</T3> a fall.``Positioning device system'' is defined as a system which is used to supportor aid an employee in working with both hands free at a given work level.``Restraint (tether) line'' is defined as a device which is attached betweenthe employee and an anchorage to prevent the employee from walking or fallingoff a work surface. It has been treated as a ``positioning device system''in the proposed standard, although its function is somewhat different.It does not support an employee at a work level, but, rather, preventsthe employee from leaving the work level or work position. The forces encounteredwith a restraint line system are much less than those experienced witha fall arrest system, and are similar to those encountered with a positioningdevice system.``Strength factor'' is defined as the ratio of the strength of a personalfall arrest system to the arresting force which would be experienced bya human during a fall arrest. This term is used in proposed requirementandSection; 1915.159(a)(4)(iv), discussed further below, which mandates thatthe personal fall arrest system be strong enough to withstand twice thedesign arresting force safely. For example, using a worker design weightof 250 pounds (113 kg), if a system were capable of limiting the arrestforce to six times the worker's weight (arrest force of 1,500 pounds (6.67kN) (250andmultiply;6=1,500)), the system strength would have to be at least3,000 pounds (13.3 kN) in order to meet the strength factor requirementof two. (The test methods contained in Appendix B of this proposal couldbe used to demonstrate a strength factor of at least two.)Section 1915.152 General requirements.In paragraph (a), OSHA proposes that employers make available to theiremployees personal protective equipment for eyes, face, head, and extremities;protective clothing; protective shields and barriers; personal fall protectionequipment; and life saving equipment whenever such equipment is necessaryfor employee protection. The employer shall ensure that the equipment isused. Personal protective equipment would include such items as hard hats,safety glasses, safety shoes, and work gloves. This paragraph is basedon current andSection;andSection; 1915.153(d) and 1910.132(a), which requirethe employer to make personal protective equipment available. Sections1915.153-1915.158(b) of this proposal incorporate the duty to use the varioustypes of equipment, as set out in current paragraph (a) of andSection; 1910.132.In addition, the proposal provides criteria for selection and proper useof personal flotation devices (PFD) (andSection; 1915.158(a)) and personalfall protection equipment (andSection; 1915.159), but does not include requirementsfor where and when such equipment must be used. Such requirements willbe included in another OSHA shipyard proposal on fall protection, SubpartM of Part 1915 (Docket No. S-046). For example, the Subpart M proposalwould require PFD's for employees working on floating vessels where otherprotection, such as guardrails, is not provided. Subpart M would also mandatethe use of personal fall protection equipment for employees working onelevated work surfaces when other fall protection is not provided.In paragraph (b), OSHA proposes that personal protective equipment be selectedto protect employees from the particular hazards to which they are exposed.This language, while based on andSection; 1910.133(a)(1), has been expandedso that it covers the selection of all personal protective equipment.In paragraph (c), OSHA would bar the use of defective or damaged personalprotective equipment. This paragraph is derived from existing andSection;andSection;1915.154(a)(2), 1915.154(b)(2), and 1910.132(a).In paragraph (d), OSHA proposes that any and all personal protective equipmentwhich has been used be cleaned and disinfected as necessary before it isreissued to another employee. This requirement is based on existing andSection;1915.151(a)(3).In paragraph (e), OSHA proposes that employees be trained in the properuse of personal protective equipment. This paragraph is based on existingandSection; 1915.152(a)(4).Section 1915.153 Eye and face protection.In paragraph (a)(1), OSHA proposes to require that eye and face protectiveequipment be used by employees when they are exposed to eye or face hazardsfrom flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, chemical gases orvapors, or injurious light radiation. This is based on the requirementscontained in existing andSection; 1915.151 (b)(1) and (c)(1).In paragraph (a)(2), OSHA proposes that eye and face protective equipmentfit employees properly. This requirement is based on existing andSection;1910.133(a)(2) (ii) and (iii), and is proposed to assure good vision andproper protection.In paragraph (a)(3), OSHA proposes, as a new requirement, that workerswho pass from well-lit to dimly-lit areas not wear protectors with tintedor variable tinted lenses. This paragraph would prevent workers from beingexposed to situations in which extreme lighting changes might temporarilyimpair their vision due to the darkened effect of the tinted lenses, suchas when a forklift operator drives a forklift from outdoors into a poorlylit warehouse. OSHA solicits comments regarding the need for and suitabilityof this proposed requirement, with emphasis on whether or not wearing oftinted lenses in these situations actually does add to the existing visionproblem caused by dim lighting.In paragraph (a)(4), OSHA proposes that employees who wear prescriptionlenses be protected by eye protection that incorporates the prescriptionin its design, or by eye protection that can be worn over prescriptionlenses without interfering with the prescription lenses such that visionbecomes impaired, or when protection is not fully provided because of interference.This requirement is essentially the same as existing andSection; 1915.151(a)(4).In paragraph (a)(5), OSHA proposes that employees use equipment with filterlenses for protection from injurious light radiation with a shade numberappropriate for the work being performed. In addition, Table I-1, <T3>Filter Lenses for Protection Against Radiant Energy, </T3>is providedto list the proper shade numbers for various operations. These provisionsare essentially the same as existing andSection; 1915.151(c)(2) and TableI-1 in andSection; 1915.118 of the current standard. OSHA proposes to moveboth sections to andSection;1915.153.In paragraph (b), OSHA proposes that the design of eye and face protectioncomply with the requirements of American National Standard Practice forOccupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection (ANSI Z87.1-1979)as stated in proposed paragraph (b)(1), or alternatively, in the case ofplano (non-prescription) spectacles, that these protectors meet the requirements,of proposed paragraph (b)(2). Paragraph (b)(2) would cover impact protection,optical requirements, flammability resistance, and radiant energy protection.It presents essentially the same protective requirements for spectaclesfound in the current OSHA standards, the current American National StandardPractice for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection, ANSIZ87.1-1979 (Reference 5), and the August 1986 and August 1987 drafts ofANSI Z87.1-198x,, (References 23 and 29) (which have been developed bythe ANSI Z87 Standards Committee, but have not yet been adopted as nationalconsensus standards). However, proposed paragraph (b)(2) does not containmany of the design restrictive provisions, such as a single minimum lensthickness (3 mm) for all spectacle lens materials, which apply in the currentOSHA standards, because they have been superseded by technological advances.In the case of the lens thickness requirement, stronger materials are beingused for protective lenses which provide sufficient protection at reducedlens thicknesses (down to 2 mm thickness). In addition, frame designs havebeen developed which provide improved employee protection, but do not conformwith the design restrictions in the current OSHA standards. The currentstandards, andSection;andSection; 1915.151(a)(1) and 1910.133(a)(6), referenceANSI Z2.1-1959 (a very early version of ANSI Z87.1) and ANSI Z87.1-1968.OSHA has determined that those consensus standards are outdated. The proposedcriteria in paragraph (b)(2), which are based on the most recent ANSI Standardand on the August 1986 and 1987 draft revisions, are much more performance-orientedthan those in the current OSHA standard, and can be met by eye and faceprotection that is currently in use. In addition, OSHA has determined thatthe majority of the eye and face protection currently in use in shipyardemployment meets either ANSI Z87.1-1979 or the proposed criteria in paragraph(b)(2), and that the level of protection afforded by these provisions isessentially the same. OSHA requests comments on this performance-orientedapproach, and on whether or not proposed paragraph (b)(2) contains theprovisions necessary to provide proper plano spectacle eye protective equipmentfor employees.Section 1915.154 Respiratory protection.OSHA proposes to substitute the requirements of andSection; 1910.134, Respiratoryprotection, for the requirements of the current andSection; 1915.152 becausethe Agency has determined that the Part 1910 respiratory protection provisionsare more comprehensive and provide better employee protection from respiratoryhazards than the Part 1915 provisions. Indeed, the Agency has determinedthat all of the requirements of existing andSection; 1915.152 are alreadyeffectively covered in andSection; 1910.134. Therefore, OSHA believes thatthe deletion of current andSection; 1915.152 will not reduce the protectionof employee safety or health. As noted above, OSHA has proposed to reorganizeand retitle Subpart I of Part 1915, so that proposed andSection; 1915.152presents general PPE requirements and proposed andSection; 1915.154 referencesthe respiratory protection provisions. The lifesaving equipment provisionsof the current Part 1915, presently found in andSection; 1915.154, wouldbe relocated to new andSection; 1915.158.OSHA has long applied andSection; 1910.134 to shipyard employment. Between1976 and 1984, violations of andSection; 1910.134 respirator provisions accountedfor over 85% of all shipyard personal protective equipment citations issuedby OSHA. On November 4, 1985, OSHA issued a field instruction, OSHA Instruction,STD .2, which affirmed that andSection; 1910.134 applies to shipyard employment.The Agency is currently reviewing andSection; 1910.134 in order to determinewhich provisions need revision, and is developing a proposed rule whichincorporates the necessary changes for all industry sectors in which itapplies. The revision of andSection; 1910.134 will involve a complex rulemakingeffort. Therefore OSHA has determined that the incorporation of andSection;1910.134, without change, into 29 CFR Part 1915 would at this time bestprotect the safety and health of shipyard employees. This proposal woulddelete the current shipyard provisions on respiratory protection in andSection;1915.152, and would place a reference to andSection; 1910.134 in new andSection;1915.154 to indicate the continued coverage of that section. Although therequirements of andSection; 1910.134 are not proposed for revision in thisrulemaking, OSHA does request comments on whether the current provisionsof andSection; 1915.152 should be deleted as proposed, or whether any ofthem should be retained in addition to andSection; 1910.134.Section 1915.155 Head Protection.In paragraph (a)(1), OSHA proposes that employers require their employeesto wear protective helmets when they are working in areas where there isa potential for injury to the head from falling or moving objects. Theserequirements are essentially the same as current andSection;andSection; 1915.153(a)and 1910.132(a).In paragraph (a)(2), OSHA proposes that employers ensure that employeeswear protective helmets designed to reduce electrical shock hazard, wheneverthey are near exposed energized conductors which could be contacted bythe protective helmet. This is essentially the same requirement as currentandSection;andSection; 1915.153(b), 1910.132(a), and 1910.135.In paragraph (b), OSHA proposes that the design of protective helmets complywith the provisions of American National Standard Requirements for ProtectiveHeadwear for Industrial Workers (ANSI Z89.1-1986) (Reference 4) or be ofa design that provides equivalent protection. The provisions in ANSI Z89.1-1986would cover impact resistance, penetration protection, flammability, waterabsorption resistance, electrical insulation and maximum weight. The currentOSHA standards for head protection, andSection;andSection; 1915.153(b) and1910.135, reference earlier editions of ANSI Z89.1, ANSI Z2.1-1959 (Reference15) and ANSI Z89.1-1969 (Reference 17). These earlier editions, exceptinsofar as they address electrical insulation for Class B helmets, specifyessentially the same requirements which are in proposed paragraph (b).One significant difference between the helmet provisions in proposed paragraph(b) (which references the latest ANSI standard for head protection (ANSIZ89.1-1986)), and the present OSHA requirements, involves the relevanttesting for helmets used for protection against live electrical conductors.The testing requirements in the 1986 ANSI standard are somewhat more stringentfor ``Class B'' helmets than those contained in the current OSHA standards.However, OSHA believes that helmets currently used for protection againstelectrical contact in shipyards meet the electrical insulation requirementsin ANSI Z89.1-1986. This involves a relatively small number of employees,primarily linemen, who generally wear helmets which are classified underthe ANSI standard as ``Class B'' helmets. The Agency solicits commentsand information on helmets presently used for electrical protection inshipyards, and whether such helmets would comply with the proposed OSHAstandards.Section 1915.156 Foot protection.In paragraph (a), OSHA proposes that employers require their employeesto wear protective footwear when they are working in areas where fallingand rolling objects create risk of foot injuries. In substance, the samerequirement is contained in andSection; 1910.132(a). This proposed languagewould, however, make a change from andSection; 1915.153(d) of the currentshipyard standards which merely requires that employers make safety shoes<T3>available </T3>and <T3>encourage </T3>their use. OSHA believes that requiring employees towear protective shoes, in certain circumstances, is a necessary precautionto protect workers' feet. In order to gain a fuller understanding of theissue, OSHA requests comments regarding the extent to which shipyard employeesalready wear safety shoes when they are exposed to foot hazards, and solicitsdata and comments on the need for the proposed requirement.In paragraph (b), OSHA proposes that the design of protective footwearcomply with the provisions of American National Standard Personal Protection-ProtectiveFootwear (ANSI Z41-1983) (Reference 3) or be of a design that providesequivalent protection. The provisions in ANSI Z41-1983 would cover compressionresistance and impact resistance. Section 1910.136 currently referencesANSI Z41-1967, which contains the same compression and impact requirementsas ANSI Z41-1983. However, the 1967 ANSI standard applies only to men'sprotective footwear. ANSI Z41-1983 covers both men's and women's protectivefootwear thus filling a serious gap in the current OSHA standards for footprotection. Protective footwear which complies with the ANSI Z41-1967 standardwould also comply with the proposed requirements in paragraph (b).As stated above, the requirement that employers ensure that employees usethe necessary protective footwear would be added through this rulemaking.Therefore, OSHA has determined that delaying the effective date of thisnew provision for 90 days would be appropriate so that employers wouldhave time to ensure that their workers are using foot protection when theyare exposed to foot hazards. The Agency invites comments, with supportingdata, regarding the need for a delayed effective date for this provision.Section 1915.157 Hand and body protection.In paragraph (a)(1), OSHA proposes that employees wear gloves and otherprotective clothing when they are exposed to hazards of heat, chemicalburns or sharp objects. This requirement is essentially the same as andSection;andSection;1915.153(f) and 1910.132(a) of the current standards, and covers the safetyhazards of cuts and chemical burns. The health hazards of toxic chemicalsand the required protective clothing are covered in Part 1910, SubpartZ, which applies to shipyards.In paragraph (a)(2), OSHA proposes that employees not wear greasy clothingwhen performing hot work. This provision is similar to current andSection;1915.153(e). It is intended to minimize the risk that the grease will catchfire and burn rapidly, especially where the workplace atmosphere is oxygenenriched.In paragraph (a)(3), OSHA proposes that electrical insulating gloves andsleeves be available to and used by employees who are exposed to electricalshock hazards while performing electrical work. This requirement is basedon current andSection; 1910.132(a).Section 1915.158 Lifesaving equipment.This section contains the requirements for lifesaving equipment, such aslife jackets, life rings, ladders and rescue lines. These requirementsare essentially the same as those found in current andSection; 1915.154,which specify that the U.S. Coast Guard requirements for this equipmentbe followed.Section 1915.159 Personal fall protection equipment.This section presents the proposed requirements for personal fall protectionequipment. The proposal covers personal fall arrest systems such as lifelines,lanyards, body belts and body harnesses, and positioning device systemssuch as window cleaner's belts and straps. OSHA has proposed these criteriabecause it intends to recognize the use of personal fall protection equipmentas an acceptable alternative to the use of guardrails, when the use ofguardrails is not feasible. The provisions for personal fall protectionequipment in proposed andSection; 1915.159 are, for the most part, basedon a National Bureau of Standards report, ``A Study of Personal Fall-SafetyEquipment'' (NBSIR 76-1146) (Reference 10) and the American National StandardRequirements for Safety Belts, Harnesses, Lanyards, Lifelines and DropLines for Construction and Industrial Use, ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference1).OSHA is currently developing a proposed rule to establish strength andother criteria for personal fall protection equipment in Subpart I of theGeneral Industry Standards, (Part 1910). In addition, on January 22, 1985and November 25, 1986, OSHA issued Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, respectively,for Powered Platforms in General Industry [50 FR 2890] (Reference 22),and Fall Protection in the Construction Industry [51 FR 42718] (Reference28), which both contained proposed criteria for personal fall arrest systems.The proposed criteria for Part 1915 parallel those in the powered platformand construction fall protection proposals. In that regard, OSHA notesthat numerous comments and much of the hearing testimony in the poweredplatform rulemaking (Docket No. S-700A) involved suggested changes in theproposed provisions for personal fall arrest systems (References 18, 20,21, and 22). OSHA invites comments on whether any such changes made inthe proposed provisions for powered platforms should also be made in theparallel provisions of proposed andSection; 1915.159. Issues relating topersonal fall arrest systems are raised at the end of this section of thepreamble.In paragraph (a), OSHA proposes performance criteria and requirements forthe use of personal fall arrest systems. This type of equipment is partiallycovered by current andSection; 1915.154(b). However, the current standarddoes not provide performance criteria for the proper functioning of thesystems.In paragraph (a)(1), OSHA is proposing that personal fall arrest equipmentbe used only for employee protection. This would prevent the deteriorationcaused by improper uses and types of loads.In paragraph (a)(2), OSHA proposes that personal fall arrest systems andtheir components which have been subjected to impact loading be removedfrom service, and that they not be used again until the equipment has beeninspected and determined, by a capable person, as defined in andSection;1915.151(c), to be undamaged and suitable for reuse. Impact loading weakensthe fall arrest system, greatly reducing its energy absorbing characteristics.Thus, if a system were used a second time, without inspection, higher forcescould be transmitted to the employee and the system. This might resultin injury to the employee. This requirement is based on paragraph 3.3.8of ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference 1).In paragraph (a)(3), OSHA proposes that lifeline and lanyards be protectedagainst being cut, abraded, burnt, or corroded by chemicals. This is essentiallythe same requirement as paragraph andSection; 1915.154(b)(3) of the currentstandard.In paragraph (a)(4)(i), OSHA would require that a fall arrest system beinstalled to minimize free fall distance so that an employee could neitherfree fall more than six feet (1.8 m) nor contact any lower level or obstruction.This provision is based on paragraph 5.3 of ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference1), and is included because the proposed system strength and decelerationcriteria are based on this maximum free fall distance, and because a fallarrest system will not protect falling employees from injury if the system,as installed, allows them to hit a lower level.In paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)-(iv), which are discussed in more detail below,OSHA proposes new performance requirements for personal fall protectionequipment. The current shipyard standards do not provide any performancecriteria for such equipment. In order to allow employers a reasonable amountof time to ensure that employees are using equipment which meets thesenew requirements, OSHA proposes to delay the effective date for these newrequirements until 180 days after publication of the Final Rule in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. OSHA solicits comments on the utility and needfor this delayed effective date.In paragraph (a)(4)(ii), OSHA proposes that a personal fall arrest systembring an employee to a complete stop within a deceleration distance of42 inches (1.1 m), excluding lifeline elongation. This distance is in additionto the maximum six-foot (1.83 m) distance of free fall and is based ona requirement contained in the British and Canadian standards (References6 and 7) for rope grab devices and self-retracting lifelines_two typesof personal fall arrest systems not yet specifically covered by any ANSIor OSHA standards. OSHA requests comments as to the appropriateness ofapplying this 42-inch (1.1 m) distance limitation to all personal fallarrest systems used in the U.S., and the availability of systems whichcurrently meet this proposed requirement.In paragraph (a)(4)(iii), OSHA proposes that a personal fall arrest system,under fall conditions, not produce an arresting force of greater than 10times the employee's weight, or 1,800 pounds (8 kN), whichever is lower.This requirement is based on paragraph 3.3.5 of ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference1), and a review by OSHA of pertinent literature on human tolerance whenusing various restraint systems (References 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12). (Seealso Issues 1 and 2 below.)In paragraph (a)(4)(iv), OSHA proposes that the strength (or safety) factorfor a personal fall arrest system be at least two. This means that thesystem would not fail even if subjected to twice the design shock load.This safety factor is derived from the strength criteria contained in theANSI A10.14 standard, using the maximum permitted arrest force of 10 timesgravity, and a design weight of 250 pounds (113 kg). In normal usage, personalfall arrest systems will experience arresting forces well below the designshock load because the free fall distance will usually be less than sixfeet (1.8 m), and because the lifeline generally used will absorb energy.Therefore, OSHA anticipates that the proposed margin of safety would beseveral times the actual arresting force. (See also Issues 2.d. and 5 below).Appendix A contains examples of test methods for evaluating personal fallarrest systems. OSHA recognizes that test methods not listed in AppendixA would also, if properly implemented, enable employers to determine whetheror not their equipment satisfies the criteria of proposed andSection; 1915.159.These examples are provided solely to assist those employers who are notaware of proper test methods for their equipment. The procedures listedin Appendix A are essentially the same as those contained in the Noticesof Proposed Rulemaking for Powered Platforms in General Industry (50 FR2890), and Fall Protection in the Construction Industry (51 FR 42718).In paragraph (a)(5), OSHA proposes criteria for attachment point locationson body belts and body harnesses. Three locations are specified, as follows:On or behind the hips; above the waist in the back; or above the head.These criteria reflect OSHA's awareness that the human body is more susceptibleto injury when deceleration forces are applied to the front of the bodybelt or harness. Also, the proposed deceleration force limits of paragraph(a)(4) are based on forces being applied to one of the three locationsspecified in this paragraph. These three acceptable locations are discussedin NBSIR 76-1146 (Reference 10).In paragraph (a)(6), OSHA proposes that body belts measure at least oneand five-eighths inches (4.1 cm) in width, in order to distribute adequatelythe arresting force over the worker's body. The proposed requirement isbased on paragraph 3.2.1 of ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference 1), which callsfor a belt which has a nominal width of one and three quarter inches (4.4cm). OSHA believes that one-eighth-inch is a reasonable tolerance to applyto this requirement, since some tolerance is necessary in the manufactureof belt webbing.In paragraphs (a)(7) and (a)(8), OSHA is proposing that hardware used inpersonal fall arrest systems be made of drop forged, pressed, formed steel,or materials of equivalent strength, and that it be protected from corrosion.In addition, the surfaces and edges of the hardware must be smooth. Theserequirements would ensure that the hardware retains the necessary strengthcharacteristics for the life of the fall arrest system and under expecteduse conditions, and that its surfaces and edges do not cause damage tothe attached belt or lanyard. In paragraph (a)(9), OSHA proposes that each employee be provided witha separate lifeline whenever vertical lifelines are used. OSHA recognizesthat using a single vertical lifeline to tie off two or more employeesperforming separate tasks is inherently unsafe. Movement by one employeecould pull the lifeline to one side. This could, in turn, cause the otheremployee(s) to lose balance. In addition, if one employee did fall, movementof the lifeline during the arrest of the fall would very likely cause anyother employee(s) connected to the lifeline to fall. Paragraph (a)(10) would require personal fall arrest systems to be securedto an anchorage capable of supporting at least twice the potential impactload of an employee's fall. This proposed provision is performance-orientedand addresses the actual forces that the activation of a specific fallarrest system would produce. For example, if a system produces an arrestingforce of 1,500 pounds (6.7 kN) during testing, the anchorage must support3,000 pounds (13.4 kN). This allows employers flexibility in selectingand designing anchorage systems, while still requiring them to provideadequate strength. The proposed provision is based on information receivedin response to the Powered Platform proposal (50 FR 2890), mentioned earlier(Reference 18). OSHA invites suggestions regarding means by which OSHAcompliance personnel can evaluate compliance with this paragraph. Paragraphs (a)(11), (a)(12), (a)(13), and (a)(14) provide the strengthcriteria for lanyards, snap hooks, dee-rings and lifelines. Under thosecriteria, the components must be able to sustain a minimum load of 5,000pounds (22.2 kN). This strength requirement is based on the force limitof 10 times gravity acting on a 250 pound (113.4 kg) employee, multipliedby a safety factor (strength factor) of two. Paragraph (a)(11) containssimilar strength criteria for vertical lifelines, but requires that self-retractinglifelines and lanyards (which automatically limit free fall distance totwo feet (0.61 m)) be able to sustain a minimum load of only 3,000 pounds(13.3 kN). The strength requirement for the cable or webbing used in self-retractinglifelines and lanyards is lower than that for other components, becausethe more restrictive limit on free fall distance limits the forces to whicha falling employee would be exposed. In paragraphs (a)(15) and (a)(16) OSHA proposes that snap-hooks not beconnected to loops in webbing lanyards or to each other. This would prohibittwo methods of attachment which are considered unsafe because snap-hookscould accidentally disengage during use. These provisions are based onparagraphs 3.2.5 and 3.2.3.2 of ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference 1), respectively.In paragraph (a)(17), OSHA proposes that no more than one snap-hook beconnected to any single dee-ring. OSHA considers multiple connections tobe unsafe because one snap-hook could cause another to become accidentallydisengaged from the dee-ring during use. Proposed paragraph (a)(18) contains the provisions which apply to the inspectionof personal fall arrest systems. In this paragraph, OSHA proposes thatthe employer visually inspect the fall arrest system for defects or damageprior to each use, and that the employer remove defective or damaged equipmentfrom service if the strength properties may have been weakened. This inspectionneed not involve testing or impact loading of the system. In paragraph (a)(19), OSHA would require that employers train employeeswho use these systems so that they know the application limits of the system;the proper hook-up, anchoring, and tie-off techniques; methods of use;and proper methods for inspection and storage. OSHA believes that employeesmust be thoroughly trained in all aspects of the system, in order for itto provide the necessary protection. In proposed paragraph andSection;1915.159(b), OSHA presents criteria forpositioning device systems. In paragraph (b)(1), OSHA would require that all hardware have a corrosion-resistantfinish and that all surfaces and edges be smooth so that they do not causedamage to the attached belt or connecting assembly. This requirement isbased on similar requirements in ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference 1). In paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3), OSHA proposes that connecting assemblies,such as snap-hooks and dee-rings, be able to sustain a load of at least5,000 pounds (22.2 kN), and that positioning device anchorages be capableof supporting twice the potential impact load of an employee's fall. Theserequirements are based on paragraphs 3.1.4 and 3.2.7 of ANSI A10.14-1975(Reference 1). Paragraph (b)(4) contains the proposed strength requirement for restraintlines, specifying that they must have a minimum breaking strength of 3,000pounds (13.3 kn). The NBS report mentioned above (NBSIR 76-1146) (Reference10) recommends a breaking strength in excess of 2,000 pounds (8.9 kN) fornew lines. OSHA believes that requiring a breaking strength of 3,000 pounds(13.3 kN) is necessary to ensure that employees are adequately protectedfrom fall hazards and is reasonable in view of the strengths and sizesof rope which are commercially available and the wear and tear expectedduring use. Proposed paragraph (b)(5) provides the system performance criteria forthe different types of positioning device systems. These are new performancerequirements that are not in the current shipyard standards. In order toallow employers a reasonable amount of time to ensure that employees areusing equipment which meets the new requirements, OSHA proposes to delaythe effective date for these new requirements (paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and(b)(5)(ii)) until 180 days after publication of the Final rule in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>OSHA solicits comments on the utility and needfor this delayed effective date. In paragraph (b)(5)(i), OSHA would require that a window cleaner's positioningsystem be able to withstand, without failure, a drop test consisting ofa six foot (1.8 m) drop of a 200 pound (113 kg) weight. In addition, thesystem would limit the initial arresting force to not more than 2,000 pounds(8.89 kN) for a duration not to exceed two milli-seconds. Subsequent arrestingforces produced due to ``bouncing'' during arrest of the fall are not toexceed 1,000 pounds (4.45 kN). A test method to evaluate this requirementis contained in appendix A. These criteria, which are essentially the sameas those presented in American National Standard Safety Requirements forWindow Cleaning, ANSI A39.1-1969 (Reference 2), are more stringent thanthe arresting force criteria for other positioning devices. This is becausea window cleaner's system allows for free falls of up to six feet (1.8m), whereas the other systems limit free fall to a lesser distance. In paragraph (b)(5)(ii), OSHA proposes that all other positioning devicesystems be capable of withstanding, without failure, a drop test consistingof a four foot (1.2 m) drop of a 250 pound (113 kg) weight. This is essentiallythe same requirement for lineman's body belt systems as is contained inthe OSHA General Industry telecommunications standards, andSection;1910.268(g)(iii)(G).In addition, while OSHA does not require that employers themselves testpositioning device or personal fall arrest systems, OSHA proposes thatpositioning device systems be considered to comply with the provisionsof (b)(5)(i) and (ii), above, if they have been tested in accordance withthe positioning device guidelines in appendix A. OSHA solicits suggestionsregarding the means by which OSHA compliance personnel can determine compliancewith this paragraph. In paragraph (b)(6)(i), OSHA proposed that snap-hooks not be connectedto each other. This would prohibit a method of attaching snap-hooks whichOSHA considers to be unsafe because snap-hooks could accidentally disengageduring use. This provision is based on paragraph 3.2.3.2 of ANSI A10.14-1975(Reference 1).   In paragraph (b)(6)(ii), OSHA proposes that positioning device systemsand their components which have been subjected to impact loading be removedfrom service. Employers would not be permitted to use the equipment againuntil the system had been inspected and determined by a capable personto be undamaged and suitable for reuse. Impact loading weakens the positioningdevice system, and greatly reduces the energy absorbing characteristicsof the system_particularly in the case of window cleaner's systems. Thus,if the system were to be used a second time, without inspection, higherforces could be transmitted to the employee and the system. This mightresult in injury to the employee. This requirement is based on paragraph3.3.8 of ANSI A10.14-1975 (Reference 1).In paragraph (b)(6)(iii), OSHA would require that employers train employeeswho use these systems so that they know the application limits of the system;the proper hook-up anchoring, and tie-off techniques; methods of use; andproper methods for inspection and storage. OSHA believes that employeesmust be thoroughly trained in all aspects of the positioning device systemin order for it to provide the necessary protection.Proposed paragraph (b)(7) contains the provisions applicable to inspectionsof positioning device systems. In this paragraph, OSHA proposes that thepositioning device system be visually inspected for defects or damage priorto each use, and that defective or damaged equipment be removed from serviceif its strength properties might have been weakened. This inspection neednot involve testing nor impact loading of the system.Appendix AAs discussed above, an appendix accompanies this proposal. This appendix(Appendix A) would be non-mandatory, containing test methods and otherinformation to assist employers in complying with the criteria for personalfall arrest systems contained in this standard. OSHA requests commentson what other provisions should be added to or substituted for the provisionsin proposed Appendix A, in order to ensure that employees receive the necessaryprotection and appropriate guidance relative to personal fall protectionsystems.Issues Relating to Personal Fall Arrest SystemsOSHA solicits information and data on a number of issues pertinent to itscoverage of personal fall arrest systems in andSection; 1915.159(a).1. <T3>Body belts. </T3>OSHA proposes to allow the use of body belts (safetybelts) for up to a six-foot (1.8 m) free fall distance, and a force limitof 10 g<T2>n</T2> or 1,800 pounds (8 kN). This is consistent with ANSI A10.14-1975(Reference 1) and NBSIR 76-1146 (Reference 10). However, the view has alsobeen expressed that the use of body belts in fall arrest systems shouldbe further restricted or even prohibited. For example, the draft InternationalSafety Organization (ISO) international standard for personal fall arrestingsystems limits the arresting force to 5 kN (1,125 pounds) when using abody belt. The draft ISO standard also prohibits the use of a system whichwould suspend a worker more than 50 degrees from a vertical position aftera fall is arrested. OSHA believes that the ISO requirements would effectivelyeliminate the use of currently available body belts in fall arrest systems.The report of a study conducted by Dr. Maurice Amphoux et al., <T3>Safety Equipment in Construction and Public Works Transportation </T3>(Reference19), recommends that workers not use body belts for fall arrest becauseof injury potential. It should also be noted that the British StandardInstitution's <T3>Specification for Industrial Safety Belts, Harnesses and Safety Lanyards(1979) </T3>(Reference 13) limits the use of body belts to a work situationwhere there is a maximum free fall of two feet (.6 m) and a maximum forceof five g<T2>n</T2>. In addition, a recent review by the U.S. Air Force AerospaceMedical Research Laboratory of pertinent literature on personal fall arrestsystems, <T3>Fall Arrest and Post-Fall Suspension: Literature Review and Directionsfor Further Research </T3>(AFAMRL-TR-84-021) Reference 14), concludes thata body belt is not safe for prolonged suspension (especially motionlesssuspension).In addition, comments and public hearing testimony received regarding theOSHA Powered Platform proposed rulemaking have asserted that employeeswearing body belts have been injured by the belts during fall arrest. Accordingly,those commenters and witnesses have suggested that OSHA limit or ban theuse of the body belt in personal fall arrest systems (Reference 20 and21).In view of this information, OSHA requests that interested parties provideinformation and views, together with supporting data, regarding the useof body belts in a fall arrest system. Specifically, OSHA solicits responsesto the following questions:a. To what extent should OSHA allow the use of body belts (safety belts)in personal fall arrest systems? If permitted, what limitations shouldbe imposed?b. Is the proposed six-foot (1.8 m) limit on free fall acceptable for employeeswho wear body belts? Should some other limitations, such as two feet (.6m), be adopted for body belts instead? What data are available to supportthe adoption of an alternative limitation?c. Is the proposed 10 g<T2>n</T2> or 1,800 pound (8 kN) force limitation for body belts acceptable?Is it acceptable for body harnesses? What would be the advantages or disadvantagesof implementing a 10 g<T2>n</T2> force limitation? What force limitation would most effectivelyprotect workers within the bounds of feasibility?d. Is there additional information available which indicates that prolongedsuspension in a body belt may cause injury to employees?e. Is there injury data which indicates that employees have been injuredby their body belts during fall arrest, or during suspension followingfall arrest?f. If body belts are not allowed in personal fall arrest systems, or iftheir use is limited so that body harnesses are more widely used, whatcost impacts would be attributable to the increased use of body harnesses?What is the availability and worker acceptance of body harnesses in theshipyard industry?2. <T3>Arresting force limits.</T3> OSHA requests comments concerning thebest method for stating the maximum arrest limitation. By using only theforce generated by a 10 g<T2>n</T2> deceleration as the limitation, the permitted force value wouldvary with the weight of the worker. For instance, based on a 10 g<T2>n</T2> limitation alone, a 275 pound (125 kg) worker would be permittedby the standard to experience 2,750 pounds (12.3 kN) of force during anarrest. In view of the human tolerance information discussed above, OSHAbelieves that this amount of force is unacceptable, and has proposed 1,800pounds (8 kN) as the maximum force. OSHA requests comments on the following:a. Does the proposal provide a reasonable means by which deceleration andforce would be taken into account? Should the limitation be expressed solelyas either maximum arrest force (pounds force), or the force generated bya maximum arrest deceleration (i.e., g<T2>n</T2>)?b. Would the proposed 1,800 pound (8 kN) limitation for body belts andbody harnesses provide the necessary protection for employees? If not,what should the limit be? What information is available to support settinga different limitation for arresting force?c. The suggested test procedures in Appendix A include a 130 pound (59kg) test weight for lanyard systems. NBSIR 76-1146 (Reference 10) identifiedlighter test weights as being more useful than heavier test weights indetermining compliance with the 10 g<T2>n</T2> limitation for lanyards, because lighter test weights do notcause lanyards to be as elastic as do heavier weights and therefore stopmore abruptly. Thus, it is more difficult to satisfy the 10 g<T2>n</T2> limit with a 130 pound (59 kg) test weight than with a 220 pound(100 kg) test weight. However, if the standard were to impose <T3>only</T3> a force limitation on fall arrest systems, without a limitationon arrest force (in pounds), the use of a 130 pound (59 kg) test weightwould not reflect the forces to which employees over 130 pounds (59 kg)would be exposed during a fall (see introductory discussion for this issue,above). OSHA requests data, views, and arguments on whether the 130 pound(59 kg) test weight for lanyard systems is appropriate, or whether the220 pound (100 kg) test weight, which is used for all other systems, shouldalso be used for lanyards during the force test.d. Comments and public hearing testimony received regarding the personalfall arrest system provisions of the powered platform proposal assertedthat the proposed test procedures were confusing and overly complicated.They recommended simplified test procedures (References 20 and 21). Arethe proposed test procedures in Appendix A too complex? If the strengthsof all personal fall arrest system components are specified, would a singlequalification test to measure arresting force be sufficient? What shouldbe the parameters of a single test (such as free fall distance, test weight,and arresting force limit)?3. <T3>Snap-hook design.</T3> OSHA has received a number of conflicting viewson snap-hook design. During meetings with the Fall Protection Group ofthe Industrial Safety Equipment Association (ISEA), several members ofthat group suggested that OSHA prohibit the use of single action snap-hooksand require, instead, the use of locking snap-hooks. Other group membersasserted that properly designed and applied single action snap-hooks provideadequate protection, so OSHA should permit their continued use. In addition,comments and public hearing testimony received regarding the personal fallarrest system provisions of the powered platform proposal recommended theuse of locking snap hooks (References 20 and 21). OSHA requests suggestions,with supporting information, regarding the type of snap-hook whose useshould be permitted. In addition, OSHA requests information on:a. The number of snap-hooks (distinguishing between single action and locking)currently in use;b. The increased cost which would be imposed if OSHA required the use oflocking snap-hooks and prohibited the use of single action snap-hooks;andc. Incidents in which either single action or locking snap-hooks have failedin use.d. The types of connections which locking snap-hooks may be used wheresuch connections would be considered unadvisable using a single actionsnap-hook.4. <T3>Inspections.</T3> OSHA requests comments regarding whether or not theAgency should provide more definitive inspection criteria for determiningwhen personal fall protection systems are no longer suitable for use. Arethere examples of such criteria which could be included in the standardor appendix? If there are, please submit these along with comments andsupporting data.5. <T3>Testing.</T3> OSHA requests comments regarding the testing of personalfall protection systems. Are manufacturers of this equipment presentlytesting and evaluating their products? If so, how do these tests comparewith those proposed in this rulemaking? Are products currently labeledas having satisfied test criteria? What information do employers have regardingtests for existing personal fall protection equipment. Can the proposedtest methods be simplified without compromising their value? If so, how?(See Issue 2. d.) Should employer testing of personal fall protection systemsbe mandatory? Are there any testing methods which can be used to determinewhether or not system components can be interchanged with those from othersystems?6. <T3>Issues raised by comments received in the powered platform rulemaking.</T3>Appendix D of OSHA's proposed rulemaking for powered platforms (Reference22) is essentially the same as proposed andSection; 1915.159(a) and AppendixA of this proposal. OSHA has received comments on Appendix D of the poweredplatforms proposal which raise issues pertinent to this proposal (References18, 20, 21 and 22). OSHA solicits comments from interested parties on theseand other points of concern.a. A commenter on powered platforms Appendix D (Reference 21) has criticizedthe test methods section as inadequate, and has suggested that equipmenttesting be required. The commenter further suggested that OSHA requireemployers to test components and subassemblies of systems, and not requirethat employers test complete systems. OSHA requests comments and suggestionsregarding the need for clarified, mandatory test methods for componentsand subassemblies of personal fall arrest systems. OSHA would be particularlyinterested in any information about consensus standards for the designand testing of components and subassemblies.b. The same commenter (Reference 21), has criticized the mandatory provisionsfor failing to spell out what equipment can be combined to form an acceptablesystem; how it can be connected; and the circumstances in which the componentsand subsystems of a personal fall arrest system would be interchangeable.It has, for example, been suggested the OSHA require that personal fallarrest equipment be labeled to indicate when and where employers coulduse it interchangeably. Would a labeling requirement addressing interchangeabilitybe feasible? What information should be placed on the label and who shouldbe responsible for labeling the equipment? If any employer or manufactureris currently using such a labeling system, please submit this informationand sample labels.c. OSHA has presented definitions for key words in proposed paragraph (c)of andSection; 1915.151. A commenter on powered platforms (Reference 21)has criticized the definitions as incomplete and imprecise. OSHA solicitscomments and suggestions regarding the adequacy of the proposed definitions,with special attention directed to the terms discussed below.(i) The term ``body support'' has been suggested to replace ``body belt.''It was further recommended that the term incorporate both body belts and``full body harnesses'' (body harnesses), in order to describe more fullythe equipment which would be appropriate for fall arrest or suspension.OSHA solicits comments and information regarding the appropriateness ofthe recommended change, given that body belts would be permitted by thestandard (see Issue, 1, above).(ii) OSHA has used the term ``deceleration device'' to describe certainfall arrest components. It has been suggested that ``deceleration device''is not properly descriptive, and that OSHA should instead utilize the terms``fall arrester,'' ``energy absorber'' and ``self-retracting lifeline/lanyard''(different types of deceleration devices) to cover the separate componentsand subsystems involved. OSHA solicits comments as to how adequately theterm ``deceleration device'' encompasses the components and subsystemswhich are used to control deceleration. OSHA also requests comments regardingthe suggestion that ``deceleration device'' be replaced by more specificterms. Supporting information should accompany comments, with emphasison the feasibility and utility of proposed definitions and other changes.(iii) OSHA has used the term ``fixed anchorage'' in Appendix D to poweredplatforms to describe an attachment point for personal fall arrest equipment.It has been suggested that OSHA revise the definition to specify that the``anchorage'' is independent of the personal fall arrest system. It wasfurther suggested that OSHA require anchorages to have a minimum strengthof 3,600 pounds when the maximum arresting force is 1,800 pounds or lessin order to provide adequate protection for workers in worst case situations.OSHA solicits comments and information regarding the need for and feasibilityof the suggested revisions.d. A commenter (Reference 21) on the powered platform proposal has suggestedthat OSHA quantify the corrosion resistance requirements, referring tothe ASTM Salt Spray Testing Standard. OSHA solicits comments and suggestionsregarding the utility and feasibility of such quantification. Suggestionsshould be accompanied by supporting information.e. It has been suggested (Reference 21) that self-retracting lifelinesand lanyards be required to meet the minimum loaned requirement (3,000pounds) with the lanyard or lifeline fully extended. It was also suggestedthat OSHA specify the maximum arresting force to be transmitted by thosedevices, taking into account the kind of ``body belt or harness'' used.OSHA solicits comments, accompanied by supporting information, regardingthe proposed requirements for self-retracting lifelines and lanyards.f. It has been suggested (Reference 21) that OSHA require proof-testingof dee-rings and snap-hooks at 100 percent of rated load to ensure thatdefective equipment is not used. OSHA solicits comments regarding the needfor such testing and suggestions for its implementation. OSHA would beparticularly interested in information concerning the cost of testing,what testing is currently performed or feasible, and any accidents involvingequipment defects.g. It has been suggested (Reference 21) that OSHA require horizontal lifelinesubsystems to be designed by ``qualified persons'' and that the requirementsfor horizontal lifelines be revised to include more detailed guidance.OSHA solicits comments regarding these recommendations. Please submit supportinginformation.h. The same powered platform commenter (Reference 21) has suggested thatemployers inspect personal fall arrest systems and their components forboth function and deterioration. OSHA solicits comments regarding the needfor, recommended procedures, and feasibility of such inspections. Supportinginformation should accompany any recommendations. To what extent wouldinspection for function approximate testing? How frequently should suchinspections take place? What would be the anticipated burden of complyingwith the suggested revision? OSHA would appreciate comment on the aboveissues.Amendments to Other Subparts of the Shipyard StandardsAs discussed earlier, this proposal contains proposed revisions to provisionsin Subparts C and H of the shipyard standards to correlate references tothe proper provisions in proposed Subpart I. This is necessary since, dueto the proposed reformatting of Subpart I, the current references wouldno longer identify the correct paragraphs in proposed Subpart I. Theseproposed revisions are editorial in nature and would not substantiallychange the current requirements in these other subparts. These proposedrevisions are included as items two through eight in the amendatory sectionof this proposal.The references listed below, as well as other information which has beenused to prepare and support this proposal, are available for public inspectionand copying at the Docket Office at the address given earlier.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment and Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis</ITAG>Introduction and SummaryIn accordance with Executive Order No. 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 17,1981), OSHA has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed standard.Under the criteria established in E.O. 12291, OSHA has determined thatthe promulgation of this proposed revision would not be a ``major'' action.The expected annualized total costs of full compliance would be about $3.7million.Data SourcesThe primary source for this assessment is the November 1985 Final Reportby CONSAD Research Corporation entitled, ``Data to Support A RegulatoryAnalysis of the Proposed Standard for Shipbuilding and Repairing.'' Inaddition, OSHA has also used an October 1984 report by Main Hurdman/KMGentitled ``Profile of the Shipbuilding and Repairing Industry.''Industry ProfileThe entire shipbuilding, ship repairing, and ship breaking industries wouldbe affected by the proposed consolidation of the personal protective equipmentsections of the existing Part 1915, Subpart I and Part 1910, Subpart Ibecause personal protective equipment is used in all shipyards. In recentyears, shipyards have not prospered as an industry. By way of illustration,there were about 400 shipyards operating in 1985, which is 200 fewer thanthe 600 shipyards active in 1980. Another illustration is that there wereorders for 69 merchant vessels (1.82 million tons) in U.S. shipyards in1980 but orders for only 10 merchant vessels (140,915 tons) in 1984. Althoughthis loss of business has been partially offset by the increase in theU.S. Navy's demands for ships, the decline in the demand for commercialships will probably cause a further decline in the total number of activeshipyards.Population-at-RiskOSHA has determined that every shipyard employee uses some of the equipmentgoverned by this proposed consolidation. Hard hats and safety shoes areworn by nearly all production workers. Safety belts and harnesses are occasionallyworn by all production workers who work at elevations where guardrailsor other structural forms of fall protection are not feasible. It is ofparticular interest to OSHA that approximately nine percent of the shipyardemployees use respirators and work in hazardous atmospheres. The actualnumber of exposed employees will depend on the overall level of shipyardemployment. For example, shipyards employed 177,300 workers in 1980 andabout 145,000 workers in 1984. Thus, OSHA has estimated that the numberof workers affected by Subpart I will be between 145,000 and 180,000. Withrespect to respirator use and work in hazardous atmospheres, OSHA has estimatedthat the population-at-risk would be between 13,000 and 16,200 employees.Risk of Fatality, Injury, or IllnessOSHA has estimated that the annual number of injuries and illnesses inshipyards due to a lack of respiratory protective equipment was between390 and 595 between 1981 and 1985. Of these injuries and illnesses, between190 and 335 were lost workday injuries. As the average number of lost workdaysfor lost workday injuries due to this type of accident was 7.7 days, OSHAhas estimated that the annual number of lost workdays in shipyards dueto lack of respiratory protective equipment would be between 1,465 daysand 2,580 days.OSHA has also determined that there would be between three and nine annualfatalities in shipyards associated with a lack of respiratory protectiveequipment. Finally, there is a potential for long-term chronic respiratorydiseases that may lead to a premature death ocurring from failure to userespiratory protection. OSHA, however, has been unable to estimate thesefuture risks.Feasibility, Benefits, and CostsOSHA has determined that this proposed standard would be technologicallyfeasible because it would permit the use of existing and readily availabletechnology and equipment.There are two potential sources of benefits from this proposed standard.The first source is the benefits that would accrue to those workers whoare at risk from current practices involving the use of personal protectiveequipment in shipyards. OSHA believes that the proposed consolidation ofParts 1910 and 1915 would likely lead to an increase in future compliancelevels because consolidating two sets of personal protective equipmentrequirements into one set would clarify the rules. Thus, the proposed consolidationmay lead to an increase in compliance which, in turn, may lead to an increasein employee safety while using personal protective equipment.Based on the CONSAD report concerning the preventability of these fatalitiesand injuries, OSHA has estimated that full compliance with the proposedstandard would prevent between two and seven out of the estimated threeto nine annual fatalities and between 290 and 475 out of the estimated390 to 595 annual injuries.The second source is the benefits that should accrue to those workers whowill be better protected from long-term chronic illnesses because of theclearer respiratory protection program. OSHA believes that better and morefrequent use of respirators within the context of a substantive respiratoryprotection program can lead to increased long-term health improvementsfor these employees.OSHA does not have any quantitative estimates of these potential benefitsand is requesting information and comments on this issue. All commentswill be carefully analyzed by OSHA for incorporation into the RegulatoryImpact Analysis (RIA) for the final rule.The basis of the estimated costs of compliance with the proposed standardis the CONSAD Report. In order to obtain this information, CONSAD circulatedcopies of the draft proposed standards to the two major industry tradeassociations and to shipbuilders. CONSAD then employed telephone questionnairesand site visits to elicit information concerning the potential economicimpact of the provisions contained in the draft proposed consolidated standard.The information was used by CONSAD to develop its estimates of the costsof compliance and those costs have been adopted by OSHA as the expectedcosts of compliance with the proposed standards.Based on the CONSAD report, OSHA has determined that there are two generalsets of provisions that involve costs of compliance. The first generalset of provisions involves the implementation of the andSection; 1910.134requirements for a comprehensive respiratory protection program. Theseprovisions involve fit-testing, annual physical examinations, formal training,respirator cleaning and inspecting, and storage specifications. Althoughthese provisions have long been applicable to shipyards, current industrypractices do not comply with them all of the time. The second general setof provisions are those affecting procedures for work in hazardous atmospheres.In particular, firms do not always have adequate stand-by personnel, properrescue equipment at hand, or a positive pressure SCBA on hand. Thus, usingthe baseline of existing industry practice, OSHA has estimated the annualizedcosts of compliance with the proposed consolidated standard to be about$3.7 million. OSHA invites public comment concerning this estimate. Allcomments will be carefully analyzed by OSHA for incorporation into theRIA for this final rule.Regulatory Flexibility CertificationPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the Assistant Secretary has preliminarily certifiedthat the proposed standard would not have a significant impact upon a substantialnumber of small entities. OSHA invites public comment concerning this certification.An important criterion that governs a regulatory flexibility analysis iswhether the proposed standard would impose significant costs upon smallentities. ``Significance'' is determined by the impact upon profits, marketshare, and on the entity's financial viability. In particular, the proposedstandard's effect upon small entities relative to that upon large entitiesmust be specifically evaluated. That is, OSHA must determine whether theproposal would have a relative greater negative effect on small entitiesthan on large entities, thereby putting small entities at a competitivedisadvantage.The proposed standard, however, has no changes that would require significantcapital expenditures. Furthermore, as these proposed provisions are moreperformance-oriented, small entities can use cost-effective methods ofemployee protection best suited to their particular work situations. Thecosts of compliance with the proposed standard primarily depend upon theamount of respirator use which, typically, depends upon the size of thefirm. Nevertheless, the percentage of small shipyards that would need toupgrade their respiratory protection programs is greater than that percentageof large shipyards that would need to upgrade their respiratory protectionprograms. Thus, the costs of compliance expressed as a percentage of totalrevenues would be larger for very small firms (fewer than 50 employees)than for very large firms (greater than 1,000 employees). These compliancecosts, however, would be a small component of the overall cost of a shipyard'sproduct.Thus, OSHA has concluded that this proposed standard would not have a significantnumber of small entities.The economic impact estimates presented in this preamble will be refinedas OSHA receives additional information during this rulemaking.OSHA solicits comments on the estimates and conclusions presented in boththe Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment and the Regulatory FlexibilityCertification. Comments received will be addressed and incorporated intothe Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the final rule.OSHA's Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment and Regulatory FlexibilityAssessment are available for inspection and copying at the OSHA TechnicalData Center, Room N-3670, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Finding of No Significant ImpactThis proposed rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental Quality(40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1517), and the Department of Labor's NEPA Procedures(29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this review, the Assistant Secretary forOSHA has determined that the proposed rule will have no significant environmentalimpact.The proposed revisions and additions to 29 CFR Part 1915, Subpart I-PersonalProtective Equipment, focus on the reduction of accidents or injuries bymeans of personal protective equipment, work practices and procedures,proper use and handling of equipment, and training. The proposal also containslanguage, definition, and format changes. These revisions do not impacton air, water, or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land,or other aspects of the environment. Therefore, these revisions are categorizedas excluded actions according to Subpart B, Section 11.10, of the DOL NEPAregulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Recordkeeping</ITAG>This proposal contains no recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Public Participation</ITAG>Interested persons are requested to submit written data, views and argumentswith respect to this proposal. These comments must be postmarked by February27, 1989, and submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office, Docket No.S-045, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2634, Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.The data, views and arguments that are submitted will be available forpublic inspection and copying at the above address. All timely submissionsreceived will be made a part of this proceeding.Additionally, under section 6(b)(3) of the OSH Act and 29 CFR 1911.11 interestedpersons may file objections to the proposal and request an informal hearing.The objections and hearing requests should be submitted in quadruplicateto the Docket Office at the above address and must comply with the followingconditions:1. The objections and hearing requests must include the name and addressof the individual or organization making the objection or request;2. The objections and hearing requests must be postmarked by February 27,1989; 3. The objections and hearing requests must specify with particularly theprovisions of the proposed rule to which objection is taken or about whichthe hearing request is made, and must state the grounds therefore; 4. Each objection and hearing request must be separately stated and numbered;and 5. The objections and hearing requests must be accompanied by a detailedsummary of the evidence proposed to be adduced at the requested hearing.Interested persons who have objections to various provisions or have changesto recommend may of course make these objections or recommendations intheir comments and OSHA will fully consider them. There is only need tofile formal ``objections'' separately if the interested person desiresto request an oral hearing. OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons who, through theirknowledge of safety or their experience in the operations involved, wouldwish to endorse or support certain provisions in the standard. OSHA welcomessuch supportive comments, including any pertinent accident data or costinformation which may be available, in order that the record of this rulemakingwill present a balanced picture of the public response on the issues involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. State Plan Standards</ITAG>The 25 states and territories having OSHA-approved occupational safetyand health plans which cover the issues of maritime safety and health mustrevise their existing standards within six months of the publication dateof a final standard or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g.,because an existing state standard covering this area is already ``at leastas effective'' as the revised Federal standard. Currently five states (California,Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) with their own state planscover private sector on-shore maritime activities.

The weightshall be a rigid, metal cylindrical object or torso-shaped object witha girth of 38 inches plus or minus four inches (96 cm plus or minus 10cm).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The fall distance to be used in the test shall be the maximumfall distance physically permitted by the system during normal use conditions,up to a maximum free fall distance for the test weight of six feet (1.83m), except as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>a</T3>) For deceleration systems which have a connection link or lanyard,the test weight shall free fall a distance equal to the connection distance(measured between the centerline of the lifeline and the attachment pointto the body belt or harness).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>b</T3>) For deceleration device systems with integral lifelines orlanyards which automatically limit free fall distance to two feet (0.61m) or less, the test weight shall free fall a distance equal to that permittedby the system in normal use. (For example, to test a system with a self-retractinglifeline or lanyard, the test weight shall be supported and the systemallowed to retract the lifeline or lanyard as it would in normal use. Thetest weight would then be released and the force and deceleration distancemeasured).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The system's performance shall be evaluated taking into accountthe range of environmental conditions for which it is designed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) A system fails the force test if the recorded maximum arrestingforce exceeds 1,800 pounds (8.0 kN), when using the 130 pound (59 kg) weight,or 2,500 pounds when using the 220 pound (100 kg) weight.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Following this test, the system need not be capable of furtheroperation. However, the unusable condition of deceleration devices mustbe readily apparent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) <T3>Deceleration device tests.</T3> (1) A rope-grab-type deceleration deviceshall be moved on a lifeline 1,000 times over the same length of line adistance of not less than one foot (30.5 cm), and the mechanism must lockeach time. Unless the device is permanently marked to indicate the type(s)of lifeline which must be used, several types (different diameters anddifferent materials), of lifelines shall be used to evaluate the device.The device's performance under conditions such as rain, ice, grease, dirt,age, type of lifeline, etc., is to be evaluated or tested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Other self-activating-type deceleration devices designed for morethan one arrest must operate 1,000 times as they would in normal service,without failure. The device shall be evaluated or tested under the environmentalconditions for which the device is designed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Positioning device systems</T3>_(a)<T3> Test conditions. </T3>(1) The fixed anchorage shall be rigid and shallnot have a deflection greater than .04 inches (1 mm) when a force of 2,250pounds (10 kN) is applied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) For linemen's body belts and pole straps, the body belt shallbe secured to a 250 pound (113 kg) bag of sand at a point which simulatesthe waist of an employee. One end of the pole strap shall be attached tothe rigid anchorage and the other end to the body belt. The sand bag shallbe allowed to free fall a distance of four feet (1.2 m). Failure of thepole strap and body belt shall be indicated by any breakage or slippagesufficient to permit the bag to fall free to the ground.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) For window cleaner's belts, the complete belt must withstand adrop test consisting of a 250 pound (113 kg) weight falling free for adistance of six feet (1.83 m). The weight shall be a rigid object witha girth of 38 inches plus or minus four inches (96 cm plus or minus 10cm). The weight shall be placed in the waistband with the belt buckle drawnfirmly against the weight, as when the belt is worn by a window cleaner.One belt terminal shall be attached to a rigid anchor and the other terminalshall hang free. The terminals shall be adjusted to their maximum span.The weight fastened in the freely suspended belt shall then be lifted exactlysix feet (1.83 m) above its ``at rest'' position and released so as topermit a free fall of six feet (1.83 m) vertically below the point of attachmentof the terminal anchor. The belt system shall be equipped with devicesand instrumentation capable of measuring the duration and magnitude ofthe arrest forces. Any breakage or slippage which permits the weight tofall free of the system shall constitute failure of the test. In addition,the initial and subsequent arresting force peaks shall be measured andmust not exceed 2,000 pounds (8.5 kN) for more than two milliseconds forthe initial impact, nor exceed 1,000 pounds (4.5 kN) for the remainderof the arrest time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) All other positioning device systems (except for restraint linesystems) shall withstand a drop test consisting of a 250 pound (113 kg)weight falling free for a distance of four feet (1.2 m). The weight shallbe a rigid object with a girth of 38 inches plus or minus four inches (96cm plus or minus 10 cm). The body belt or harness shall be affixed to thetest weight as it would be to an employee. The system shall be connectedto the rigid anchor as it would be connected in normal use. The weightshall be lifted exactly four feet (1.2 m) above its ``at rest'' positionand released so as to permit a vertical free fall of four feet (1.2 m).Any breakage or slippage which permits the weight to fall free to the groundshall constitute failure of the system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-27001 Filed 11-28-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
