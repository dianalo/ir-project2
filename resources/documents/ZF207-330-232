a strangely compelling genre of science fiction that hasgained a cult following among hackers operating on both sides of the law.andO;Books with titles like True Names, Shockwave Rider, Neuromancer, Hard-wired,Wetware, and Mona Lisa Overdrive are shaping the realities of many would-beviral adepts.andP;  Anyone trying to make sense of the social culture surroundingviruses should add the books to their reading list as well.andM;Cyberpunk got its name only a few years ago, but the genre can be traced backto publication of John Brunner's Shockwave Rider in 1975.andP;  Inspired by AlvinToffler's 1970 best-seller Future Shock, Brunner paints a distopian world ofthe early 21st Century in which Toffler's most pessimistic visions have cometo pass.andP;  Crime, pollution and poverty are rampant in overpopulated urbanarcologies.andP;  An inconclusive nuclear exchange at the turn of the century hasturned the arms race into a brain race.andP;  The novel's hero, Nickie Haflinger,is rescued from a poor and parentless childhood and enrolled in a top secretgovernment think tank charged with training geniuses to work for amilitary-industrial Big Brother locked in a struggle for global politicaldominance.andM;It is also a world certain to fulfill the wildest fantasies of a 1970s phone&quot;phreak.&quot;andP;  A massive computerized data-net blankets North America, anelectronic super highway leading to every computer and every last bit of dataon every citizen and corporation in the country.andP;  Privacy is a thing of thepast, and one's power and status is determined by his or her level ofidentity code.andP;  Haflinger turns out to be the ultimate phone phreak: hediscovers the immorality of his governmental employers and escapes intosociety, relying on virtuoso computer skills (and a stolen transcendentalaccess code) to rewrite his identity at will.andP;  After six years on the run andon the verge of a breakdown from input overload, he discovers a lost band ofacademic techno-libertarians who shelter him in their ecologically soundCalifornia commune and ...andP;  well, you can guess the rest.andM;Brunner's book became a bestseller and remains in print.andP;  It inspired a wholegeneration of hackers including, apparently, Robert Morris, Jr.andP;  of Cornellvirus fame.andP;  The Los Angeles Times reported that Morris' mother identifiedShockwave Rider as &quot;her teen-age son's primer on computer viruses and one ofthe most tattered books in young Morris' room.&quot;andP;  Though Shockwave Rider doesnot use the term &quot;virus,&quot; Haflinger's key skill was the ability to write&quot;tapeworms&quot;--autonomous programs capable of infiltrating systems andsurviving eradication attempts by reassembling themselves from viral bits ofcode hidden about in larger programs.andP;  Parallels between Morris' reality andBrunner's art is not lost on fans of cyberpunk: one junior high student Ispoke with has both a dog-eared copy of the book, and a picture of Morristaped next to his computer.andP;  For him, Morris is at once something of a folkhero and a role model.andM;In Shockwave Rider, computer/human interactions occurred much as they dotoday: one logged in and relied on some combination of keyboard and screen tointeract with the machines.andP;  In contrast, second generation cyberpunk offersmore exotic and direct forms of interaction.andP;  Vernor Vinge's True Names wasthe first novel to hint at something deeper.andP;  In his story, a small band ofhackers manage to transcend the limitations of keyboard and screen, andactually meet as presences in the network system.andP;  Vinge's work found anenthusiastic audience (including Marvin Minsky who wrote the afterword), butnever achieved the sort of circulation enjoyed by Brunner.andP;  It would beanother author, a virtual computer illiterate, who would put cyberpunk on themap.andM;The author was William Gibson, who wrote Neuromancer in 1984 on a 1937 Hermesportable typewriter.andP;  Gone are keyboards; Gibson's characters jack directlyinto Cyberspace, &quot;a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions oflegitimate operators ...andP;  a graphic representation of data abstracted fromthe banks of every computer in the human system.andP;  Unthinkable complexity.andO;Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters andconstellations of data ...&quot;andM;Just as Brunner offered us a future of the 1970s run riot, Gibson'sNeuromancer serves up the 1980s taken to their cultural and technologicalextreme.andP;  World power is in the hands of multinational zaibatsu, battling forpower much as mafia and yakuza gangs struggle for turf today.andP;  It is a worldof organ transplants, biological computers and artificial intelligences.andO;Like Brunner, it is a distopian vision of the future, but while Brunnerevoked the hardness of technology, Gibson calls up the gritty decadenceevoked in the movie Bladerunner, or of the William Burroughs novel, NakedLunch (alleged similarities between that novel and Neuromancer have triggeredrumors that Gibson plagiarized Burroughs).andM;Gibson's hero, Case, is a &quot;deck cowboy,&quot; a freelance corporate thief-for-hirewho projects his disembodied consciousness into the cyberspace matrix,penetrating corporate systems to steal data for his employers.andP;  It is a worldthat Ivan Boesky would understand: corporate espionage and double-dealing hasbecome so much the norm that Cases's acts seem less illegal than profoundlyambiguous.andM;This ambiguity offers an interesting counterpoint to current events.andP;  Much ofthe controversy over the Cornell virus swirls around the legal and ethicalambiguity of Morris' act.andP;  For every computer professional calling forMorris' head, another can be found praising him.andP;  It is an ambiguity thatmakes the very meaning of the word &quot;hacker&quot; a subject of frequent debate.andM;Morris' apparently innocent error in no way matches the actions of Gibson'scharacters, but a whole new generation of aspiring hackers may be learningtheir code of ethics from Gibson's novels.andP;  Neuromancer won three of sciencefiction's most prestigious awards--the Hugo, the Nebula and the Philip K.andO;Dick Memorial Award--and continues to be a best-seller today.andP;  Unambiguouslyillegal and harmful acts of computer piracy such as those alleged againstDavid Mitnick (arrested after a long and aggressive penetration of DEC'scomputers) would fit right into the Neuromancer story line.andM;Neuromancer is the first book in a trilogy.andP;  In the second volume, CountZero--so-called after the code name of a character--the cyberspace matrixbecomes sentient.andP;  Typical of Gibson's literary elegance, this becomesapparent through an artist's version of the Turing test.andP;  Instead of holdingan intelligent conversation with a human, a node of the matrix on anabandoned orbital factory begins making achingly beautiful and mysteriousboxes--a 21st Century version of the work of the late artist, Joseph Cornell.andO;These works of art begin appearing in the terrestrial marketplace, and ayoung woman art dealer is hired by an unknown patron to track down thesource.andP;  Her search intertwines with the fates of other characters, buildingto a conclusion equal to the vividness and suspense of Neuromancer.andP;  Thethird book, Mona Lisa Overdrive answers many of the questions left hanging inthe first book and further completes the details of the world created byGibson including an adoption by the network of the personae of the pantheonof voodoo gods and goddesses, worshipped by 21st Century Rastafarian hackers.andM;Hard core science fiction fans are notorious for identifying with the worldsportrayed in their favorite books.andP;  Visit any science fiction convention andyou can encounter amidst the majority of quite normal participants, smallminority of individuals who seem just a bit, well, strange.andP;  The stereotypesof individuals living out science fiction fantasies in introverted solitudehas more than a slight basis in fact.andP;  Closet Dr. Whos or Warrior Monks fromStar Wars are not uncommon in Silicon Valley; I was once startled to discoverover lunch that a programmer holding a significant position in a prominentcompany considered herself to be a Wizardess in the literal sense of theterm.andM;Identification with cyberpunk at this sort of level seems to be becoming moreand more common.andP;  Warrior Monks may have trouble conjuring up ImperialStormtroopers to do battle with, but aspiring deck jockeys can log into avariety of computer systems as invited or (if they are good enough) uninvitedguests.andP;  One individual I spoke with explained that viruses held a specialappeal to him because it offered a means of &quot;leaving an active alter egopresence on the system even when I wasn't logged in.&quot;andP;  In short, it was thefirst step toward experiencing cyberspace.andM;Gibson apparently is leaving cyberpunk behind, but the number of books in thegenre continues to grow.andP;  Not mentioned here are a number of other authorssuch as Rudy Rucker (considered by many to be the father of cyberpunk) andWalter John Williams who offer similar visions of a future networked worldinhabited by human/computer symbionts.andP;  In addition, at least one magazine,Reality Hackers (formerly High Frontiers Magazine of drug fame) is exploringthe same general territory with a Chinese menu offering of tongue-in-cheekparanoia, ambient music reviews, cyberdelia (contributor Timothy Leary'sterm) and new age philosophy.andM;The growing body of material is by no means inspiration for every aspiringdigital alchemist.andP;  I am particularly struck by the &quot;generation gap&quot; in thecomputer community when it comes to Neuromancer: virtually every teenagehacker I spoke with has the book, but almost none of my friends over 30 havepicked it up.andM;Similarly, not every cyberpunk fan is a potential network criminal; plenty ofpeople read detective thrillers without indulging in the desire to rob banks.andO;But there is little doubt that a small minority of computer artists arefinding cyberpunk an important inspiration in their efforts to create anexceedingly strange computer reality.andP;  Anyone seeking to understand how thatreality is likely to come to pass would do well to pick up a cyberpunk novelor two.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
