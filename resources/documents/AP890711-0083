He was 82.   He died ``peacefully in his sleep,'' surrounded by friends andrelatives, said his agent, Laurence Evans. The cause of death wasnot given.   Olivier's last professional appearance was in the 1988 movie``War Requiem,'' based on the oratorio by composer Benjamin Britten.   He was to be buried in a private funeral service, with a publicmemorial service to be held later, Evans said.   Knighted, ennobled and revered by the film and theater world, hewas Lord Olivier when he died, one of the very few Britons to begiven a seat in the House of Lords for his acting prowess.   His Hamlet, Henry V, Othello and Richard III were widelyacclaimed, as well as, at age 76, his performance for television ofKing Lear. He was a tragic film hero in ``Wuthering Heights'' andportrayed the painful experience of aging in ``The Entertainer'' onstage and ``A Voyage Round My Father'' and ``Brideshead Revisited''on television.   At the same time, with ferocious will, he fought cancer, pleurisyand a muscle disease that made even handshakes agony. He endured twomiserable marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright,contemplated murder and suicide and battled his own rages, guiltsand drinking.   On his 80th birthday, tributes flowed during a ceremony at theNational Theater, which he founded in 1963.   ``Awe and wonder, you gave us awe and wonder,'' actress DamePeggy Ashcroft told him at the time. Director Peter Hall called him``the genius performer.''   For Olivier, life and acting were inseparable. ``I have to act tobreathe,'' he said.   By turns, he loved and hated his craft _ but never wouldcontemplate retiring from it. Acting simply consumed him.   He was forever searching for new ways to broaden his range andreach the hearts of his audience. For instance, seeking to conjureup as abject a cry of despair as has ever been heard on stage, hewould imagine the cry of the arctic seal when it licks the salt laiddown by its hunters and its tongue sticks to the ice.   Whatever sex drive he had, Olivier wrote in his 1982autobiography ``Confessions of an Actor,'' went into his acting.``You can't be more than one kind of athlete at a time. A sexualathlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of anotherathletic kind.''   Born May 22, 1907, in the town of Dorking southwest of London,Laurence Kerr Olivier was the third child of an Anglican clergymanwho encouraged him to try acting.   His first stage was at home, with footlights made of cocoa cans.At 10, he was Brutus in a school performance. At 15, he donnedwomen's clothes to play Katherine in a Stratford Festival boys'production of ``The Taming of the Shrew.''   After studying acting in Birmingham, his first professional rolewas in 1922 in a sketch in a small touring company. In his firstLondon role, in Alice Law's 1924 ``Byron,'' he tripped over adoorsill and fell on his face.   His first marriage, to actress Jill Esmond in 1930, produced ason but ended in divorce. Meanwhile, his career was soaring throughNoel Coward's ``Private Lives'' in London and New York, andShakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' in which he and John Gielgudalternated playing Romeo and Mercutio.   With Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, fellow knights-to-be, heformed a partnership that re-made English theater.   Olivier played a dazzling succession of Shakespearean triumphs _Hamlet, Henry V, Macbeth. Movie stardom came in 1939 when he movedto Hollywood and made ``Wuthering Heights.''   In that same year, Olivier appeared with Vivien Leigh in a NewYork production of ``Romeo and Juliet.'' After nearly two years ofclandestine love, he obtained a divorce and the two were wed.   That marriage, glamorous in public, was another debacle. Leighsoon fell out of love, had a series of affairs and descended intomanic depression that tormented Olivier. He had crippling bouts ofstage fright and contemplated suicide.   They finally were divorced in 1961, and Olivier wed actress JoanPlowright, with whom he finally found happiness. They had a son,Richard, and two daughters, Tamsin and Julie-Kate. All three areeither studying, or working in, the theater.   During World War II, he made the three films that sealed hisreputation as the finest Shakespearean actor in film: ``Henry V,''``Hamlet,'' for which he won a best-actor Oscar in 1949, and``Richard III.'' In 1979, he received a special Academy Award forhis film work.   In the 1960s and 1970s he had scores of memorable roles, from thefading comic Archie Rice in John Osborne's ``The Entertainer'' toAstrov in Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' to the Nazi who tortures DustinHoffman in the film ``Marathon Man.''   Olivier was proudest of his founding of Britain's NationalTheater. ``Only a man of his titanic standing and relentless energycould have brought the project to fruition,'' wrote Alan Hamilton inThe Times.   He was among a group of actors knighted for their work, but in1971 was elevated to a peerage as Baron Olivier of Brighton. Theonly other theatrical peer is actor and theater founder BernardMiles.   Other actors knighted included Gielgud, Richardson, Ms. Ashcroft,Judi Dench, Alec Guinness and Michael Redgrave.   His last public performance was a tape-recorded speech withextracts from Henry V, his contribution to a campaign to preventdevelopers covering up the ruins of the Rose Theater in London,where Shakespeare is thought to have acted.</TEXT></DOC>
