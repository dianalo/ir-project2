But everyone will be able to visit soon.;   Thehistoric house, built in 1877 by orchardist David Greenawalt but now crowdedby the new Highway 85 freeway a few feet away, will be moved Sunday to the SanJose Historical Museum grounds.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE HOUSE THAT PROGRESS SPLITVICTORIAN MOVING TO S.J. MUSEUM  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The house faced demolition until Councilman Jim Beall came to the rescue bysuggesting that it be moved to the museum grounds.;   The Giacomazzi family,which bought the house in 1939, agreed to donate the home and part of themoving expenses.;   The house is the oldest in Beall's council district, and&quot;it's been sort of a landmark for us who grew up around here,&quot; he said.;   Hisfirst preference was to move it somewhere else in his district, but &quot;we didn'thave any space for it&quot; that would be accessible for the public.;   Built ofold-growth redwood, the house is structurally sound, untouched by termites orrot. The foundation stands strong and solid, built of sandstone from thequarry that also provided material for Stanford University and what is now theSan Jose Museum of Art.;   Inside, the walls show cracks, one from the 1906earthquake, two others from the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. But the house has beentreasured by its occupants over the years. Heavy flowered wallpaper on a greenbackground with silver accents has adorned the home since Greenawalt'sgranddaughter, Helen Reid of San Jose, was a child. The gracefully curvedhardwood staircase, the original doors and windows, and the exterior trim areintact.;   John Giacomazzi, whose late parents, John and Gelia, bought thehouse in 1939 when he was 10, credits his mother's care for the house'scondition. &quot;She very dearly loved the house and was very meticulous aboutmaintaining it.&quot;;   Even for its day, the house was something special.;  &quot;It's a beautiful example of a very good Italianate house,&quot; said CraigMineweaser, the architect handling the move and renovation. &quot;Usually, afarmhouse would be in a much plainer style,&quot; he said.;   Greenawalt, who lefthis Pennsylvania home and crossed the plains in 1850, apparently was asuccessful farmer, but a get-rich-quick scheme he tried once didn't work sowell. He married in 1851 and took his bride on a year-long &quot;honeymoon&quot; toAustralia, but the trip actually was a gold-mining expedition that failed.Greenawalt and his wife, Eliza Booth Greenawalt, returned to the Santa ClaraValley to raise a family and grow grain and fruit.;   As each of their sevenchildren married, Greenawalt carved a 40-acre plot off the home place forthem, said Reid, who was born in the house and remembers it fondly. She can'tremember why it was sold, but &quot;they should have kept it in the family,&quot; shesaid.;   The museum will provide a place to preserve the house and make itaccessible, though just how it will be used hasn't been decided.;   &quot;It willbe an entrance piece,&quot; possibly a restaurant near the front gate, saidarchitect Mineweaser. Other ideas include turning it into a bed-and-breakfast,or a place for wedding ceremonies or receptions.;   First though, there is themove. The roof was removed in two pieces because it was too high to travel thefive miles to the museum. It is expected to take all day to move the threesections.;   Structural work should be finished by November. No timetable hasbeen set for the interior renovation, but Beall's office estimates it willtake about six months.;   Then it will be part of the museum village, addinganother piece of the past for visitors to experience.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOANNE GRANT, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910921  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  673  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, September 21, 199100265112,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
