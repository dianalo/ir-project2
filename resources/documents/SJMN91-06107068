A few other states limit such relationships for varyingperiods after therapy ends.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Science andamp; Medicine  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THERAPIST'S SEX WITH EX-PATIENT USUALLY DAMAGING,STUDY FINDS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Psychology  </MEMO><TEXT>     National surveys have shown that up to 12 percent of male therapists and 4percent of female therapists have been sexually intimate with current orformer patients. The new study shows that close to one-fourth of thoserelationships start after therapy ends.;    Study authors Ken Pope, a LosAngeles psychologist and author, and Valerie Vetter, senior specialinvestigator for the Medical Board of California, found that post-therapyintimacies can trigger an array of psychological problems for the formerpatient. Those problems include nightmares, alcohol and drug abuse anddifficulties forming intimate relationships, Vetter said in an interview. Inextreme cases, psychiatric hospitalization or suicide may result.;    &quot;It isnever a safe thing, never an appropriate thing to do,&quot; said Pope.;    Thestudy involved 654 psychologists across the country. Half reported treating orassessing at least one patient who had been sexually involved with a formertherapist. In 77 percent of the cases, the sexual relationship started beforetherapy ended, while 23 percent started after therapy ended. Eighty-sevenpercent of the cases involved female patients.;    Intense feelings about atherapist, which are part of a psychological phenomenon known as transference,typically persist five to 10 years -- or longer -- after therapy ends, Popesaid.;    Some therapists and experts in the field now argue that all statesshould follow Florida's example. According to this view, even in cases of verylimited professional contact -- for example, a single therapy session 10 yearsago -- intimate relationships should be prohibited in perpetuity.;    &quot;Moreand more people are saying, 'Let's err on the side of the consumer,' &quot; saidPaul Schauble, professor of psychology at the University of Florida atGainesville and an executive of the Florida Board of Psychological Examinersfrom 1981 to 1988.;    Others, however, say that after a reasonable amount oftime has passed, such as two years, sexual relationships should be allowed.Proponents of that view argue that other health professionals, includingphysicians, are allowed to date and marry former patients.;    &quot;A two-year banshould be sufficient to dissipate any transference relationship,&quot; saidRandolph Reaves, executive officer and general counsel of the AmericanAssociation of State Psychology Boards.;    Thomas S. O'Connor, executiveofficer of the California Board of Psychology, which regulates the state's9,000 psychologists, said the prohibition should be &quot;forever.&quot;;    Patientswho have suffered rape or childhood abuse end up &quot;re-victimized&quot; in a sexualrelationship with a therapist, O'Connor said. &quot;Then they're in a Catch-22: 'Idon't trust therapists. What do I do now?' &quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BERNARD BAUER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910416  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  504  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 16, 199100107068,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
