Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/07/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><GV>POSTAL SERVICE (POS)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Mailing a first-class letter likely willcost 29 cents starting early next month, but it probably willcost only 27 cents to mail some bill payments.   Postmaster General Anthony Frank said a new two-level,first-class rate scheme recommended by the Postal RateCommission is acceptable to the Postal Service. Although theagency had proposed boosting the rate to 30 cents from itscurrent 25 cents, he expressed &quot;relative satisfaction&quot; withthe commission's recommendations and said the postal Board ofGovernors probably will accept them when it votes later thismonth. If so, the new rates will go into effect Feb. 3.</LP><TEXT>   The commission's rate schedule would bring in to thepostal service an estimated $6.2 billion in additionalrevenues a year, only about $100 million below the amountsought by the service.   The recommended new approach would set a 29-centfirst-class rate. But it would let people pay only 27 centsto mail bill payments using return envelopes with bar codesprovided by many firms. The bar codes enable post offices touse automated equipment for more efficient processing.   Mr. Frank did say, however, that it will take &quot;quite a bitmore thinking&quot; to put the two-tier plan into effect.   The proposed new charges are part of a package ofrecommendations disclosed over the weekend by the commission.While recommending that the increase in the first-class ratebe held to 16%, the commission urged a 25% increase in therate for third-class bulk mail sent by advertisers. Theservice had proposed a 17% increase.   By the commission's calculations, the Postal Service'srate proposal would boost revenue from first-class mail to135% of the cost of handling it from 120%, while trimmingrevenue from third-class mail to 79% of its costs from 84%.By contrast, the commission said its plan would lift thefirst-class burden to 124% of a fair share of costs and thethird-class portion to 93%.   A postal users group formed last year by consumer advocateRalph Nader applauded the commission's emphasis on reducingthe relative burden on first-class mailers. But the groupsaid the commission should have frozen all rates at currentlevels to &quot;squeeze&quot; the postal agency to become moreefficient. The American Bankers Association said thecommission's rollback of the Postal Service proposal was &quot;awonderful victory.&quot;   Third-class mailers, for their part, were even moreunhappy with the commission recommendations than they werewith the Postal Service's proposed rate rises. Gene DelPolito, executive director of the Third Class MailAssociation, called the new recommendations &quot;a disaster&quot; andthe product of &quot;political ratemaking.&quot; The Direct MarketingAssociation, another mailer group, said businesses will be&quot;seriously hurt&quot; by the recommended third-class rateincreases.   The commission endorsed the postal agency's plan to givedeeper discounts for volume mailers when they pre-sort orbarcode their letters, including use of the four extra digitsin addition to the five-digit ZIP codes for more precisedistribution for delivery. But the commission modified theservice's proposed schedule of discounts.   The postal Board of Governors has little practicalalternative to accepting the recommendations, though it couldtry to rebuff them.   To be sure, the board could reject them and send them backto the commission for further review, or the board could letthem go into effect under protest and still return them for asecond review. But in either case, the board could only spurnthe commission's ultimate recommendations and put its ownplan into effect by a unanimous vote of its five boardmembers -- and only on the ground that the commission planwouldn't provide adequate revenue.   By law, the Postal Service must break even over a periodof years. George Haley, the postal commission's chairman,said Congress has saddled the postal agency with new budgetburdens since its rate filing in March 1990, and he noted aworsening forecast for the impact of the economy on postalrevenue. But &quot;significantly better&quot; Postal Service financialperformance, which the agency has ascribed to a reduced workforce and more automation, slightly outweighs the negativefactors, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
