Wasn't it &quot;Friday the13th&quot;? Of all of George Bush's answers at the worst pressconference of his presidency last Friday, the most depressingwas his reference to 1982. He meant the notorious &quot;TEFRA&quot; taxact of that summer, the lowest moment of the Reaganpresidency until Iran-Contra. Does Mr. Bush really want to doa summer sequel?   The question matters, because for all the uproar over thedemise of the no-new-tax pledge, the budget summit isn't overyet. What matters is the deal George Bush signs. But if TEFRAis his historical guide, we should all start calculating ourlower take-home pay. That history is worth rehearsing lest itbe repeated.   The $100 billion TEFRA tax hike was the Washingtoncommunity's first attempt to repeal Reaganomics. Mr. Reagansigned onto it in the middle of recession (and amid muchBeltway gloating), but he overcame it later for two reasons.First, TEFRA repealed only part of the much larger 1981Reagan tax cut; when the tax cut's fiscal stimulus finallyhit in 1983, the economy boomed. Second, voters could accepta modest U-turn from Ronald Reagan because his publicidentity as a tax-cutter was already so strong. Mr. Bush hasneither Reagan card in reserve.   Just how bad was TEFRA in 1982? Let us count the ways.Though it was peddled as a deficit-reducer, the budgetdeficit still soared -- to 6% of the economy in 1983.Congress spent as ever. The $3 in promised spending cuts forevery $1 of tax increases never materialized.   TEFRA also proved irrelevant to its other avowed purpose,that of inducing the Federal Reserve to reduce interestrates. In his exhaustive 1987 book on the Fed, journalist(and no friend of Reaganomics) William Greider wrote that&quot;there was no real connection&quot; between the tax deal and theFed's decision to ease. &quot;The Fed had decided to ease interestrates a full month before final passage of the tax bill was acertainty,&quot; he wrote. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker had otherreasons to act: Trouble in Mexico and at Penn Square Bankthreatened the banking system, and the economy was already indeep recession.   As for politics, Republicans lost 26 House seats thatNovember. TEFRA didn't help. Larry Kudlow, the Bear Stearnseconomist who worked at the White House at the time, recallssimply that, &quot;TEFRA was a disaster.&quot;   Mr. Bush's aides now insist they've learned since then.But there are signs that maybe they haven't learned enough --Mr. Bush's Friday comments for one. Nicholas Brady, theTreasury secretary, supported TEFRA while in the Senate in1982 and has said privately that a budget deal is critical toget the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates again. Yetthis Fed, as much as Paul Volcker's, has to its great creditfollowed its own economic logic.   &quot;What worries me,&quot; says one GOP official with longexperience in Washington, &quot;is that this has become a monetaryfishing expedition.&quot; TEFRA aside, the last administration totry to trade fiscal austerity for monetary ease in this wayleft office in 1981.   Then there's Richard Darman, the crafty budget directorwho was also present at TEFRA's creation. Mr. Darman is smartenough to know the history, but he also badly wants a budgetdeal so he can claim a successful tenure at OMB. Seniorofficials worry that in the end Mr. Darman will give up anyserious reforms of the budget process if he can get majorcuts in entitlements (Medicare). Already, White House aidessay the line-item veto is off the table. At least thecapital-gains tax cut is still living, but other new taxeswill be offered to Democrats in exchange.   George Bush has run a tactical presidency, tacking as thepolitical pressures shift. But even tacticians have theirmoments of definition, and this is one. If he gets the con-cessions he wants from Democrats, his tax reversal may beforgiven. But Democrats, having won repeal of the tax pledgeat no cost to them, will not now cooperate easily. Theirdemands will escalate to include the symbolic repeal ofReaganomics, through an increase in the top marginal taxrate.   Painted into his tactical corner, Mr. Bush will have onlytwo options if Democrats don't budge. He can accept a phonyTEFRA-like deal that will be heralded by his enemies as&quot;statesmanship&quot; but will in fact signal a great defeat. Hewill gain Beltway applause without getting control over thebudget.   Or he could reject a bad deal, and explain to voters thathe put everything on the table and still got no help from ado-nothing Congress. He could blame Democrats for causing thetrauma of Gramm-Rudman's automatic budget cuts. Blood wouldflow, but the betting here is that with his bully pulpit andresidual popularity, Mr. Bush would prevail. Of course, thiswould require a political courage and public candor rarelyseen so far in the Bush White House.   In changing his mind about lip-reading, Mr. Bush asks usto remember Abraham Lincoln. But if Mr. Bush merely repeatsthe debacle of 1982, a different presidential analogy will beon voters' lips. That president grew up in Georgia, notIllinois.</TEXT></DOC>
