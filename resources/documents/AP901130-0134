LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The soldiers who sharedThanksgiving dinner with President Bush said Friday they welcomedthe ultimatum set by the U.N. Security Council as the only way toget Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.   ``He better let the hostages go and he better leave, or we'recoming to get him,'' said Sgt. William R. Blocker, 7, ofSylacauga, Ala., who chatted with Barbara Bush as he ate his turkeyand trimmings.   A week after their commander-in-chief told them he would not letSaddam remain in Kuwait indefinitely, soldiers from the 197thInfantry Brigade gathered in their dusty desert camp to voicesupport for his latest success at the United Nations.   Several said the resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraqfails to leave conquered Kuwait by Jan. 15 should have been adoptedmonths ago. It was passed Thursday.   ``I think it's about 90 days too late, but I can live with Jan.15,'' said Sgt. Mark Channer, 25, of New York City, who was Mrs.Bush's escort.   His advice to Saddam: ``Pack up and move out quick.''   Sgt. James Landreth, 29, of New Boston, Ohio, who ate turkeywith Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, echoed Channer saying, ``itshould have happened a while back. As we got here, they shouldalready have figured that out.''   For months, Blocker said, the troops have ``been in limbo'' notknowing if they were going to stay here or go home.   ``Now we know we're going to be here 'til the end - 'til heeither leaves or we force him out. It's a good relief to hearsomething like that because basically they opened the door and letus out of the dark and they let us know what was going on,''Blocker said.   Cpl. Thomas Cook, 32, of Granite City, Ill., like the rest ofthe brigade has spent three months in a desolate patch of desert,about an hour's ride from the nearest paved highway in a four-wheeldrive vehicle down a bumpy sand trail.   Bush wants to put an end to the stalemate, he said.   ``We can't just sit out here and just keep yelling at each otherso somebody's got to do something,'' Cook said.   Sgt. 1st Class Steven Campbell, 37, of Ft. Benning, Ga., wherethe brigade is headquartered, said: ``It's an indication again thatwe're not going to back down from Hussein. I think it needed to bedone and we did it, and the U.N. is the forum to do it.''   ``I'd like to get home sooner to my wife and children, but I'mnot packing my bags yet,'' said the 19-year Army veteran whointroduced the president to the 1,250 soldiers and politicians atThanksgiving dinner.   Spec. Robert Terry, 23, of Rehoboth Beach, Del., said Bush'svisit helped morale and the U.N. resolution would also be a boost.   ``I think the guys out here - now that they have a positive datethat something will happen, I think that'll help 'em out,'' hesaid.   ``But truthfully, I think Hussein'll pull out before that. He'sgot more brains than that,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
