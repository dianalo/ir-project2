The insurers that settled just before trial was scheduledto begin included Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., HomeInsurance Co., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and TravelersCorp.'s Travelers Insurance Co. unit. Nine other defendantspreviously placed a total of $16 million in escrow underearlier pacts, bringing the total settlement package for thelitigation to about $50 million.</LP><TEXT>   In 1979, Minnesota lawmakers enacted a bill requiring thatthe rates employers pay for workers' comp insurance should beestablished by the competitive market. Under previousprocedures, a state insurance-industry group known as theWorkers' Compensation Insurance Rating Association ofMinnesota set the rates after receiving prior approval fromthe state's insurance commissioner.   The suit was filed in 1983 on behalf of all Minnesotaemployers, alleging that the rating association and somemember companies had continued for four years to operateunder the old rate-setting system.   For those years, the legislation had established a &quot;baserate&quot; that the insurance companies thought was too low. Whilethe federal McCarran-Ferguson Act largely exempts insurancecompanies from antitrust prohibitions, the Minnesotaemployers' suit claimed the practice constituted a conspiracyto fix prices and use boycotting tactics, which McCarranexplicitly forbids.   In 1987, federal Judge James Rosenbaum in Minneapolisgranted a motion for summary judgment in favor of theinsurance companies; that ruling was subsequently overturnedby the federal appeals court in St. Louis.   Under the latest settlement, which still requires courtapproval, none of the defendants admitted to any wrongdoing.&quot;It was strictly a business decision to settle,&quot; said aspokesman for the insurance group, which has spent in excessof $10 million defending the case to date. &quot;We think we havea good case, but the cost to pursue it to completion wouldprobably not be a prudent decision,&quot; given the additionalcosts of defending the case through what he said could beanother five or six years.   ---   NEW CHIEF JUDGE for the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia.   Judge Abner Mikva took over as presiding judge when JudgePatricia Wald, who will remain on the bench, stepped asidetwo years before the expiration of her seven-year term aschief judge. Judge Wald was the first woman to serve as chiefjudge of a federal appeals court.   The D.C. Circuit, as it's called, is one of the mostimportant courts in the nation below the Supreme Court,deciding many major federal regulatory disputes. Judges Waldand Mikva were both appointed by President Carter, but thecourt now is dominated, 8-4, by appointees of PresidentsReagan and Bush.   The change in presiding judges took place just beforeJudge Mikva, a former Chicago congressman, would have becomeineligible to serve as chief judge because of his 65thbirthday, which was yesterday. Chief judges are chosen byseniority, but no judge may become chief judge after reachingthe age of 65.   Judges Wald and Mikva have said that tradition was thereason for the switch and scoff at the suggestion that therewas any other motivation.   But one side effect is to make it less likely that one ofthe court's conservatives, Judge Laurence Silberman, will bein the line of succession to be chief judge at the end of thedecade.   ---   MOSCOW CIRCUS goes to court to halt alleged imitator.   Circus Productions Inc., which has the exclusive NorthAmerican rights to promote the group of Soviet circusperformers, accused Columbia Artists Management Inc. ofillegally using a similar name for its own circus act. In asuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Circus Productionsasked the court to prohibit Columbia Artists from using thewords Moscow, Soviet, Russia or similar geographic terms intheir promotional material.   Last fall, Columbia Artists Management prepared a brochurepromoting &quot;Moscow Circus on Stage.&quot; Although Columbia said itlater agreed to change the name to &quot;Direct From Russia,Circus on Stage,&quot; Circus Productions wants the promotionalmaterial to carry a prominent disclaimer saying that the actsaren't related to the 100-year-old Moscow Circus.   Doreen Costa, an attorney for Columbia Artists Management,said at a hearing that the company doesn't believe itspromotional material is a trademark infringement. &quot;It isn't aname,&quot; she said. &quot;It's simply a geographic indicator.&quot;   At the hearing, both companies said they would try toagree on an appropriate disclaimer.   ---   NOTED: Francis S.
