(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tentative early contract settlementbetween the United Auto Workers union and Chrysler Corp. wasapproved Friday by the UAW's 140-member national Chrysler council.   The job-protecting pact will be presented to rank-and-filemembers next week for ratification.   The two-year contract covers 66,000 hourly and salaried workersand 65,000 retirees at the No. 3 automaker. If ratified by workers,it will replace a three-year pact that would have expired Sept. 14.   The Chrysler council approved the pact after a 5{-hour meeting.One of the subjects of debate was a provision that would have givenfull Chrysler seniority to former American Motors Corp. workers in1990. The settlement was approved after that provision was takenout.   ``It should pass. The job security is there, that was the mostimportant issue,'' said Mike Allen, a union official with UAW Local624 in Syracuse, N.Y.   ``It is a good contract and will provide reasonable gains until1990,'' said Thomas Russell, president of Local 1413 in Huntsville,Ala.   But Russell, whose plant belongs to the Acustar Inc. partssubsidiary that Chrysler tried unsuccessfully to sell earlier thisyear, added that his temperament was altered somewhat because,``I'm still stinging from the proposed sale of Acustar'' and hadhoped the contract would keep Chrysler from being able to sell theoperation.   Unlike the Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. agreements itwas patterned on, the Chrysler pact also includes a $1,000 signingbonus, guarantees workers will receive a minimum of $500 inprofit-sharing for 1988 regardless of the company's performance andprevents Chrysler from paying executives cash or stock bonuses inyears when a profit-sharing formula generates no payout for workers.   In addition, it will cover 1,200 former AMC workers in Wisconsinbeginning 90 days after a 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha,Wis., closes at year's end. Workers at a 1,000-worker engine plantin Kenosha and a 200-worker parts depot in Milwaukee, whoseoperations will remain open, will then be folded into the UAW'sChrysler family.   In order to finish negotiations, Chrysler and the UAW firstsettled the issue of millions of dollars that AMC owed 9,000active, laid-off and retired Wisconsin workers when Chrysler boughtthe ailing automaker in August.   Under that settlement, the workers will receive an average of$6,000 to $8,000 each or $57 million _ 100 percent of the moneythey loaned AMC in concessions in 1982 but none of $8 million ininterest AMC had promised.   Some delegates at Friday's meeting said they weren't satisfiedwith the $1,000 signing bonus, in part because of the size of thepayments to AMC workers.   But most indicated they expected the industry-pattern pact to beratified.   A particular high point was a provision that appears to preventthe layoff of workers at four of Chrysler's Acustar Inc. partsplants to be closed or sold by September 1989. The four plants _three in the Detroit area and one in Van Wert, Ohio _ employ about2,000 workers.   Under the contract, Chrysler will continue paying the salariesof workers who otherwise would be laid-off if the plants or closedor sold. Instead of being laid off, those workers would be placedin a job bank and allowed to move to other plants when openingsoccur.   If any of the plants are sold, their workers also can choosewhether they will stay with Chrysler or go with the purchaser.   ``I can live with that. That's what we attempted to negotiate,''said Don Lingar, president of Local 372. Lingar's 105-workerAcustar chemical plant in Trenton is certain to be closed becauseof serious health-and-safety problems.   The contract returns Chrysler to the industry pattern for thefirst time since 1979, when the UAW granted Chrysler deepconcessions to help it win federal loan guarantees that rescued theautomaker from the verge of bankruptcy. In 1990, all Big Threecontracts will expire together, giving the UAW a choice of any ofthe three at which to set the pattern for the others.   The pattern contract prevents further plant closings and layoffsfor any reason other than production cuts caused by slow sales,halves the attrition rate, restricts companies' ability to transferwork to outside suppliers or foreign countries, pays lump sumbonuses equal to 3 percent of wages each year and providesprofit-sharing based on a company's U.S. performance.</TEXT></DOC>
