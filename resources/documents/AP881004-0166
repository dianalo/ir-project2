In the wake of Mithileshwar Singh's release, President Reaganagain ruled out negotiating with pro-Iranian elements holding nineAmericans, although he said dealing with the situation has been ``agreat problem for us.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. governmentwas doing ``everything possible'' to get the hostages out. ``Butwe're not negotiating, and we're not holding discussions that couldbe construed as that,'' he said.   Under intense questioning, Fitzwater declined repeatedly to tellreporters what steps were being taken. But he acknowledged thatU.S. officials were bewildered by the circumstances behind therelease of Singh, believed to have been held by Islamic Jihad forthe Liberation of Palestine, a pro-Iranian group.   ``We continue to maintain various channels of communication,''he said. ``You may assume that we would undertake all the analysispossible.''   Fitzwater would not say whether U.S. officials were attemptingto learn, through other governments and third-party contacts in theMiddle East, the reasons for Singh's release after 20 months incaptivity.   ``We attribute no motives to his release. We don't know why theydid it or what they were seeking,'' the spokesman said. But he madeclear that engaging in public speculation about Iran's intentionswould be a disservice to the Americans still held captive.   ``We simply wouldn't speculate on those kinds of things,''Fitzwater said. ``We're not making any offers, not making deals.We're not offering incentives.   ``I guess our only point is that if improved relations (with theUnited States) are desired, there are avenues to do that and thefirst step is to release all the hostages _ today.''   Saying hostage relatives in this country have frequently beendiscouraged and disappointed over false signals of imminentprisoner releases, Fitzwater said, ``I would say to these peoplethat we're working to get these hostages out.''   Fitzwater mentioned specifically Peggy Say, the sister ofAssociated Press Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson, andVirginia Steen, wife of Alann Steen. Anderson has been held longerthan the other hostages, since March 1985. And Mrs. Steen had herhopes falsely raised with public reports of her husband's imminentrelease Monday.   The State Department, meanwhile, thanked Syria for facilitatingSingh's departure from Lebanon and also thanked ``those who playeda part'' in gaining his release.   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley declined to specifically includeIran, although she said it has influence with the hostage-holdersin Lebanon.   ``We do not know why he was released and not the others,'' Mrs.Oakley said. ``He does not have any information on it, either.''   Singh, a business professor, told American diplomats in Damascushe had seen the three other educators held by the Islamic Jihad,but provided no information about their condition. ``We have noindication about the fate of the other hostages,'' Mrs. Oakley said.   Singh, who is diabetic, will be questioned more thoroughly at aU.S. military hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany. A ``debriefingteam'' headed by Assistant Secretary of State Michael Newlin willmeet with him, Mrs. Oakley said.   The administration has steadfastly denied that it has undertakenany talks directly with Iranian officials to get the hostagesreleased.   The disclosure of clandestine arms sales to Iran, aimed atsecuring the release of the prisoners during 1985 and 1986, led tothe Iran-Contra affair _ and ultimately led to the administration'sworst foreign policy controversy.   While Fitzwater said U.S. officials did not know why Singh wasset free, he also said, ``I think it's an intentional attempt tomanipulate the (American) news media. ... ''   ``I would just hope that as we go through this, the media shouldremember some of the lessons they learned through Iran-Contra, justas we did, and that is that everyone is subject to manipulationhere.''   Reagan, asked whether he thought American hostages might soon beset free, replied, ``I haven't seen any indication of that.''   ``I just can't talk about it any further,'' he told reportersduring a Cabinet Room picture-taking session with Republicancongressional leaders.   Asked if he thought Iran was attempting to manipulate theoutcome of the U.S. presidential election, Reagan smiled and said,``Well, if they are, I hope they're on the right side.''   According to records kept by the State Department's Office forCounter-Terrorism, nine Americans and three Britons, includingTerry Waite, an emissary of the Anglican church in England; anItalian, an Irishman and a Belgian are held in captivity inLebanon. However, other sources give other numbers.   In a related development, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the formerpresident of Iran, said that secret hostage release negotiationswere conducted with Iran by an aide to Republican presidentialcandidate George Bush, and that a new channel for U.S.-Iranianlinks has been opened up.   Bani-Sadr said that according to his information, a man namedRichard Lawless negotiated Singh's release.   Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said: `Those assertions areabsolutely false. Absolutely no one is representing the vicepresident, the office of the vice president or the campaign in anydealings with the hostages, or any other dealings with Iran.''   Fitzwater said, ``There is a fellow named Lawless. He is overthere. What he's up to, nobody knows. But he doesn't represent theUnited States. ... He does not represent the vice president or thepresident or anybody else.''</TEXT></DOC>
