The Intel chip, code-named the N-10, turned out so well thatIntel might offer it as a central processor for computers instead ofjust an adjunct, some industry analysts believe.   ``The N-10 is a major event. It's had a lot of excitement builtup around it and it does appear to be the highest-performanceprocessor soon to be available,'' Michael Slater, editor ofMicroprocessor Report newsletter, said Tuesday.   Intel declined to comment on the chip in advance of itspresentation, citing secrecy rules of the International Solid StateCircuits Conference.   The three-day conference draws scientists and engineers from allthe major U.S., Japanese and European semiconductor makers.Companies often use it to announce their most important researchadvances.   Intel and Motorola Inc. are the world's leading companies in thefield of microprocessors, the brains of personal computers andworkstations.   Industry analysts who have heard about the N-10 said it isdesigned to operate at very high speeds on mathematical calculationsand graphics, making it a good supplement to traditionalmicroprocessors such as Intel's 80386 and the 80486 that is due outlater this year.   The N-10 could handle the ``grunt work'' of high-speed,repetitive calculations while the main processor handled morecomplex tasks, said Dean McCarron, a microprocessor expert atIn-Stat Inc. in Scottsdale, Ariz.   It probably would take a personal computer equipped with the N-10and the forthcoming 80486 microprocessor a few seconds torecalculate a long electronic spreadsheet, instead of the minute itwould take on today's fastest PCs, McCarron said.   Beyond serving as a co-processor, though, Slater said he believesIntel will announce later this month that the chip will also beavailable for more general uses.   Intel's problem is that computers would have to be redesigned toaccept the N-10 as a central processor. The N-10 is built withso-called Risc technology, for reduced instruction set computing,that makes it incompatible with other Intel microprocessors.   ``Every time you have a new, different architecture everybody hasto revise their software to work with that architecture,'' Slatersaid.   Intel's only public statement on the N-10 is a brief abstract ofthe paper it is presenting in New York, in which it says the chipwill have peak speed of 150 million operations a second. That isfive times faster than Risc chips designed by Motorola and Japan'sFujitsu Ltd.</TEXT></DOC>
