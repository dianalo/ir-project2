Fred Woerner said inan interview in which he described the administration's goals assimplistic and short-sighted.   ``The specific language was, the president decided it was timefor a change,'' Woerner said in describing how Defense SecretaryRichard Cheney told him in July that he was being removed. ``Andthen when I said I was entitled to more of an explanation ... I wastold it had nothing to do with performance but (was for) politicalreasons.''   Woerner's contention contradicts the Pentagon's denial in Julywhen it announced he was being replaced.   Woerner, a longtime Latin American hand who retired from theArmy earlier this month, left his post as head of the command justdays before the failed Oct. 3 coup attempt to oust Panamanian Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega.   During the attempted overthrow, U.S. troops blocked two roads inPanama, spoke with the rebel leaders and watched the firefightsfrom their hillside vantage point. Several congressional leaderscontended later that the United States should have stepped in tooust Noriega.   Woerner, who generally opposes U.S. troop intervention, added,``The president, I think, in his handling of the last major event,the failed coup, demonstrated his lack of willingness to committroops.''   The American government started pushing for Noriega's ousterafter a series of demonstrations in 1987. The move heightened whenthe Panamanian general was indicted on drug-trafficking charges inthe United States in 1988.   President Bush has repeatedly said he is not giving up onefforts to get Noriega out of office. The president also has saidhe considers Noriega to be the problem _ not the Panama DefenseForces that Noriega heads _ and that if Noriega is forced out andfree elections are held, the country will have ``instant improvedrelations'' with the United States.   Woerner said that in the Bush administration's policy, ``Therewas a lot of heat generated but not necessarily sound policy orstrategy to support U.S. interests.'' He said the goals of the Bushadministration were short-term: get Noriega out and restoredemocracy.   ``You link those two together and you have what theadministration believed was an easy objective,'' Woerner said.   ``That means you put your policy ... in the hands of Noriega. Ifhe stays your policy fails. If he goes, you succeed,'' Woernersaid. ``I know Noriega; I didn't want to put the success or failurein his hands.''   The U.S. policy assumed Noriega's ouster would remove theproblem, but Woerner contended it only would create ``a promotionfor the next thug.''   The general said his remarks were seen as being soft on Noriega.   ``It is very difficult to speak out on Panama in a positioncontrary to the administration's without appearing to be soft onNoriega,'' he said.   Noriega does have to be deposed for democracy to succeed, heconceded, but added the U.S. policy cannot stop there. Woerner saidhe sought a plan calling for an internal opposition group, strongU.S. support for that group and international condemnation of thesituation.   ``I do not believe a problem of this magnitude can be solved byexternal forces in the United States,'' he said. ``And we can'tjust transfer a democratic ideal or objective.''   ``I said we were greatly underestimating Noriega's stayingpower. And that was not a popular position to take,'' Woerner said.   The answer is not military intervention, he said, adding: ``Wecould intervene and take out Noriega. That's the easy thing. It'sgetting out and leaving something behind to say those Americanmilitary men that lost their lives changed Panama for the better.''</TEXT></DOC>
