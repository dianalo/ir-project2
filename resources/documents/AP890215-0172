The city's ban on the sale of the rapid-fire weapons will remainin effect, however, while the lawsuit filed Monday by ColtIndustries Inc. is considered.   The City Council on Feb. 7 banned the sale of semiautomaticweapons including Colt's AR-15, the AK-47 and the Uzi. The law alsobars possession of such guns after Feb. 22 unless they have beenmodified so they cannot fire.   New York-based Colt, makers of the legendary Colt .45-caliberrevolver and the AR-15 _ a civilian version of the military's M-16 _contends in its lawsuit that the law will harm the company'sfinances and its image.   A court hearing was postponed Wednesday because of thejurisdiction issue.   ``By making one of our firearms illegal by specifying in anordinance that it's an apparently bad or unuseful weapon not(intended) for sporting is bad for our reputation,'' Colt attorneyHarry G. Melkonian said after the Wednesday's court session.   ``Colt is making a fine and precision weapon and firearm used fortarget shooting and competition. It's a sporting rifle and not aSaturday night special. We're really offended that we're thrown intothis category,'' he said.   City officials said Colt was ignorant of the dangers of firearmsin Los Angeles. There were 452 gang-related slaying in Los AngelesCounty in 1988, most of which were committed with guns and many withsemiautomatic weapons.   Guns sales have become an emotional issue statewide since aschoolyard massacre Jan. 17 in Stockton in northern California. Agunman using a AK-47 assault rifle killed five children and wounded29 other students and a teacher.   ``Obviously, the Colt executives don't walk the streets of LosAngeles and experience the violence we have here,'' said CouncilmanZev Yaroslavsky, who introduced the ordinance.   About 30 states, including California, are considering some sortof control or ban on semiautomatic weapons.   U.S. District Judge William Gray delayed a hearing on Colt'srequest to issue a temporary restraining order to block theordinance.   Gray said he must decide if he has jurisdiction in Colt's lawsuitor if it should be sent to state court. He scheduled a hearing forFeb. 22.   City attorneys agreed that enforcement of the possession banwould be suspended until March 1 pending the outcome of the nexthearing before Gray.   ``We're very pleased with the results,'' Melkonian said. ``As faras we're concerned, this is the beginning of the end of thisordinance.''   City Attorney James Hahn predicted otherwise. ``We're going toprevail in this issue. What happened today keeps our ban againstsales in effect,'' he said.   Colt Industries wants the ordinance barred on grounds that itillegally preempts state law regarding the sale and possession ofweapons and would force a hardship on the company.   Deputy City Attorney Byron Boeckman said he would argue thatstate law does not bar cities from regulating weapons.   ``We contend the state never said we can't regulate the use orpossession of most weapons. It is not a matter of statewide concern,but of local concern,'' Boeckman said.   According to the lawsuit, Colt shipped more than $100,000 worthof the rifles and other firearms to the Los Angeles area just priorto enactment of the ordinance, which prohibits dealers and retailersfrom receiving them.   ``They must either break sales contracts with Colt or be incriminal violation,'' the suit contends.</TEXT></DOC>
