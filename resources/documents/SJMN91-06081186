Even between performances at the International Sportsmen'sExhibition at the San Mateo Fairgrounds early this month, Fagerstrom was athis casting pond, aiming at hula hoops, wading pools, plastic buckets, coffeecups -- even at a tiny coffee cream container the size of a thimble.;   Anyone who took the time to watch soon learned that it was a lot easier tokeep track of his misses than his hits.;    Fagerstrom gave his first castingdemonstration in 1952 when a manufacturer asked him to demonstrate a new levelwind reel.;    &quot;I remember thinking that I knew a lot about casting and foundout in a hurry that I didn't know all that much,&quot; recalls Fagerstrom. &quot;Two ofthe top casters in the world were at that show. I learned a lot from them,knowledge that I've used ever since.&quot;;    Now, Fagerstrom, in his sixties,travels from coast to coast, giving some 60 shows a year.;    Fagerstromdidn't start out as a trick caster. He's been an outdoor writer since 1946,when he worked as a reporter and outdoor columnist for the Longview (Wash.)Daily News.;    &quot;Bill Rae, editor in chief of Outdoor Life, bought my firstoutdoor magazine story,&quot; says Fagerstrom. &quot;It was about crappie fishing in thesloughs along the lower Columbia River.&quot;;    Since then, Fagerstrom haswritten hundreds of articles, mostly about bass fishing, and three books --&quot;Catch More Bass,&quot; &quot;Catch More Steelhead,&quot; and &quot;Catch More Crappie.&quot;;   Fagerstrom admits that the casting and writing go well together, but he didn'tlearn to cast for the sake of doing tricks. He did it to become a betterfisherman.;    Fagerstrom feels that 10 percent of the anglers catch 90percent of the fish. Part of that disparity is the ability to use, to themaximum, the tools available to today's angler.;    &quot;I'm convinced that mostmales come into the world thinking they know all there is to know about threethings -- driving a car, sex, and how to catch fish,&quot; he says. &quot;The thing is,they don't know beans about any of them. Two of those they're willing topractice, but neither one is fishing.;    &quot;I'd a lot rather teach a gal how tofish than a man. She knows she doesn't know and she's willing to learn.&quot;;   Fagerstrom feels that learning to control the variables in fishing isimportant.;    The first is to learn to fish. Then learn to cast -- to castoverhand, to cast underhand and to flip; to learn to cast accurately and topresent the lure correctly. When you master all of this, it will translateinto more fish, says Fagerstrom.;    &quot;You must have quality, balancedequipment,&quot; says Fagerstrom. &quot;I recommend 10- or 12-pound test line on a levelwind reel and a 5 1/2-foot light to medium-light action rod.;    &quot;Forgetdistance and concentrate on accuracy. I set up two targets, one at 25 feet andone at 30 feet. A hula hoop or a kid's wading pool make excellent targets.Beginners should practice with 5/8-ounce, 3/8-ounce and 1/4-ounce weights.&quot;;   He recommends 6-pound test line for spinning reels and practicing with1/4-ounce weights.;    Fagerstrom's demonstrations are spellbinding. He caststo a box, landing the plug in front of it, alongside, then behind it. On thenext cast he swings the weight so it rolls into an opening in the side of thebox.;    Near the end of his performance, a young boy comes onto the castingplatform and holds out a pointed finger. Fagerstrom drops the weight over theoutstretched finger and lets the line wrap around it. He does it again withthe boy's little finger.;    Then he asks a young girl, who might be eightyears old, to help him. She stands facing him some 30 feet away, her feetapart, holding an inverted hat down and away from her body, with her headcocked to one side. Fagerstrom casts a plug over her shoulder, it drops overher back, swings up between her legs and loops into the hat.;    You'd have tosee it to believe it.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dale Lackey  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910321  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  775  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 21, 199100081186,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
