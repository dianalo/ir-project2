He conducted secretinquisitions. He intimidated, he sentenced, he purged, heexecuted. He falsified the present -- and the past. Histrials had fake evidence to match the fake confessions. Noone was too powerful, or too powerless, to be exiled.   But now -- with once-suppressed historical records comingout of the Soviet Union like worms crawling from a corpse --it is clear that the historical view of Joseph Stalin, evenmore than that of the other titans of this blood-soakedcentury, is a work in progress. The other day, for example,Mikhail Gorbachev used the occasion of the 50th anniversaryof the Nazis' massacre of Jews at Babi Yar to launch anattack on &quot;the Stalin bureaucracy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Given the difficulties of sorting out the new history fromthe old, Robert Conquest's &quot;Stalin: Breaker of Nations&quot;(Viking, 448 pages, $25) is a brisk, informative synthesis,and an efficient introduction for those who are stillwondering how the U.S.S.R. got into its present fix. Theauthor of a series of landmark books on modern Soviet history-- themselves only recently published in what we arebeginning to call the former Soviet Union -- Mr. Conquestmakes the case that Stalin was no accidental tourist in therealm of tyranny.   He argues, for example, that Stalin not only directed theGreat Terror of 1936-38 but tended to the smallest details,signing 383 separate lists of names for execution. On one dayalone in December 1937, he approved 3,167 death sentences andthen went to the movies. He developed not only a cult ofpersonality but one of cruelty.   Trotsky regarded Stalin as a mediocrity but not anon-entity. Hitler regarded him as &quot;a beast, but a beast on agrand scale.&quot; Mr. Conquest calls Stalin a &quot;strange being,&quot;presents his evidence, and then pronounces a heavy sentenceon him:   &quot;Few men in history have had such long and devastatingeffects -- and not only on their own countries but on theworld as a whole. For two generations Stalin's heritage haslain heavy on the chests of a dozen nations, and the threatof it has loomed over all the others, in the fearfulpossibility of nuclear war.&quot;   Mr. Conquest set out to write a long book, but wiselyspent more time taking things out of his manuscript thanputting them in. He picks important themes -- Stalin's slowreaction to crises, for example -- and sketches the man instark colors.   Born Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili, he used a handfulof noms de guerre (Vasily, Ivanovich, Salin, K. Solin, KobaIvanovich, among others, before settling on Stalin) andacquired dozens of sickeningly phony appellations (SupremeGenius of Humanity, Theoretician of Genius and Organizer ofCollective Farm Construction, Leader of Genius of the Toilersof the Whole World). But Stalin was no man of multiplepersonalities. He had only one, and it was fearful to behold.   Like many of the revolutionaries of czarist Russia, Stalintoured the empire's prisons and lonely outposts of exile,using the experience to set up his own penitentiary chainwhere the stockade was always open. Mr. Conquest tracesStalin's moves along this route, cleverly annotating thechronicle with comments that one prison &quot;was to have afearful reputation under Stalinism&quot; and noting that VologdaProvince, where he was exiled for two years, &quot;was later to beone of the largest of the Stalinist labor camp areas.&quot;   No one was insulated from the terror of a man who treatedlife with contempt. He once tossed a chicken out the windowbecause he didn't like the way it was cooked and he sent mento exile, prison, ruin or execution with the sameimpulsiveness and crude temper. The intellectuals who opposedmass collectivization, which has to have been one of thehalf-dozen worst ideas of the 20th century, were branded as&quot;bourgeois-kulak ideologists.&quot; The farmers who opposed itwere deported on trains or sent on forced marches, some tolabor camps, some to more immediate death.   The best that Stalin's apologists could come up with inthe past was that he saved the Soviet Union, and perhaps theWest, from Hitler, but in this slender volume Mr. Conquestmakes clear the price of that victory, in which the U.S. andBritain played more than a cameo role. He suggests, moreover,that it might not have been so terrible a struggle had Stalinnot liquidated his best military minds, left his officercorps in tatters and panicked when attacked by the Nazis.   Many of the details of this ghastly canvas can be found inanother new work, Dmitri Volkogonov's &quot;Stalin: Triumph andTragedy&quot; (Grove Weidenfeld, 642 pages, $29.95). Mr.Volkogonov was a hard-liner in the senior ranks of thepostwar Soviet military who secretly gathered much of hismaterial, poking at odd hours through the archives of theInstitute of Marxism-Leninism and even rummaging throughStalin's personal library, noting the marginal jottings.   Mr. Volkogonov is no longer a hardliner, of course, butthe danger is that he may be a prophet. &quot;The fact that Stalinhas been knocked off his pedestal does not mean thatStalinism has been eradicated, and one cannot preclude thepossibility that some form of equally baneful neo-Stalinismcould be restored,&quot; he writes. &quot;This is not a prophecy,merely a warning from history.&quot;   ---   Mr. Shribman is a reporter in the Journal's Washingtonbureau.</TEXT></DOC>
