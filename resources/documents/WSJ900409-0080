Some administration officials argue privately that it'stime to abandon Washington's soft-glove approach to Iraq.They want to put Baghdad on notice that the U.S. will tightenthe economic screws unless Iraq radically alters itsbehavior, specifically by curtailing its efforts to developnuclear and chemical weapons.</LP><TEXT>   The tougher stance is most evident in Congress, especiallythe House, where a drive to impose economic sanctions alreadyis under way. The ever-cautious Bush administration willoppose these efforts, White House officials say, because itbelieves quiet diplomacy is more effective than legislation.But even some administration Mideast analysts concede thatthe U.S. has little to show for its attempts to prod Baghdadtoward moderation.   Arguments for a tougher policy were fueled by the recentreports that Iraq tried to smuggle nuclear-bomb triggerdevices out of the U.S., and even more so by PresidentHussein's threat to use chemical weapons against Israel ifhis country is attacked.   In addition, an Iraqi-American was indicted Friday by afederal grand jury in California for allegedly participatingin an Iraqi plot to kill two foes of the Iraqi government inthe U.S.   Recent concerns about Iraq were first aroused by a speechMr. Hussein delivered in Jordan in February. For the firsttime since the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, the Iraqipresident questioned the need for the continuing U.S. navalpresence in the Persian Gulf. Moderate Arab states toldWashington privately that they disagreed with that view, andthey voiced worries that the Iraqi leader was trying to givehimself a freer hand to dominate the region.   Before the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq regularly threatened itsneighbors. Kuwait faced Iraqi claims to part of itsterritory; Jordan encountered pressure from Baghdad wheneverit became involved in efforts to achieve anIsraeli-Palestinian peace; and Saudi Arabia worried about thevulnerability of its oil fields to the huge Iraqi militarymachine to its north.   Iraq moderated its behavior and improved its relationswith the U.S. when it was bogged down in its war with Iran.The U.S., in turn, softened its stance, and American policysince then has been designed to keep Baghdad in the moderatefold. But some analysts say the February speech signaled thatMr. Hussein really hasn't altered his long-term intention todominate the region. These officials suggest that the mildU.S. policy now may be jeopardizing Washington's Arabfriends.   While the accommodative U.S. policy appears to havefailed, there are reasons to believe that Saddam Husseincould be vulnerable to increased U.S. pressure.   Iraq is trying to rebuild its war-torn economy and badlyneeds Western help. Sanctions legislation proposed by Rep.Howard Berman (D., Calif.) would deny the Iraq credit fromthe U.S. Export-Import Bank, ban exports of items that couldhave a military use and commit the U.S. to oppose any loan orother assistance to it from international financialinstitutions.   But the sanctions bill wouldn't ban agricultural creditguarantees, even though farm sales are the bulk of U.S.exports to Iraq. An aide to Rep. Berman says such arestriction would make the bill unacceptable to grain-statelegislators. The aide argues that the bill, nevertheless,would impede Iraq's rebuilding efforts.   Iraq also may be susceptible to pressure because it sooncould be involved in the kind of international dispute thatpushed it toward moderation in the past. Turkey is building adam on the Euphrates River, which supplies water furtherdownstream to Syria and Iraq. Turkey refuses to commit itselfto a water-sharing agreement, and Syria is a bitter enemy ofBaghdad. So water, the Middle East's most precious commodity,could produce new tensions and put Iraq, once again, in needof friends.   The U.S., meanwhile, may feel compelled to get tough withIraq to further its claim to a leadership role in a world ofresurgent democracies. U.S. allies who want to see thathappen could cite the State Department's own words. In itsreport this year on human rights, the department calls Iraq'srecord &quot;abysmal.&quot; The report says that the country usestorture and summary execution to deal with dissidents andthat freedoms of press, speech, assembly and association are&quot;virtually nonexistent&quot; under Mr. Hussein's regime.</TEXT></DOC>
