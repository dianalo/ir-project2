The Uniform Crime Reports for 1988, released Sunday, said thenumber of all violent crimes _ including rape and robbery _increased 5.5 percent to a new high of 1.56 million. The previoushigh for violent crimes was 1.48 million in 1987.   Property crimes _ burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicletheft _ rose 2.8 percent to 12.36 million, for a combined total of13.9 million.   When the population increase was taken into account, the rate ofcrimes per 100,000 people in 1988 rose 2.1 percent, the FBI said,with the violent crime rate going up 4.5 percent and the propertycrime rate increasing 1.8 percent.   The greater increase in violent crimes could be attributed tothe aging of the nation's population, said criminologist AlfredBlumstein, dean of the School of Urban and Public Affairs atCarnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.   ``When you look at the age profile of offenders, what you seeis, in the property crimes, a very sharp peak between say 14 and20,'' he said. ``That's the age at which the population size is nowshrinking, whereas violent crimes have a much broader peak,extending well into the 30s.''   Blumstein said battles among drug dealers may provide anotherreason for the growth in violent crime.   The reports from law enforcement agencies nationwide, combinedin a publication called, ``Crime in the United States,'' do notreveal the impact of drug-related violence, notes FBI DirectorWilliam S. Sessions.   ``At all levels of government, from the White House to thesmallest townships, the ongoing `war on crime' includes dailybattles involving illegal drugs and drug-related crime,'' Sessionssaid in the report.   ``While violent crime known to law enforcement reached anunprecedented high in 1988, there is currently no way to measureaccurately drug involvement in these unwelcome statistics,'' hesaid.   The slayings took place primarily in the nation's cities, whichexperienced a 4 percent increase in the number of murders, whilesuburban and rural areas saw a 2 percent reduction in the number ofkillings, the report says.   The murder counts increased 10 percent in the Northeast, 4percent in the South and 1 percent in the West while the Midwesthad a 3 percent decline in the number of slayings.   Among the 18,269 murder victims for which details wereavailable, 13,632 were male, 4,611 were female and the sex of 26was unknown. Some 49.3 percent were white, 48.1 percent were black,1.6 were other races and the race of 1 percent was unknown.   More than half the victims were related to or acquainted withtheir assailants, 12 percent were slain by strangers, and therelationship was unknown for 33 percent.   The nation's overall murder rate was 8.4 per 100,000, but themajor city with the highest rate, Washington D.C., suffered a ratemore than seven times as high, 59.5. The FBI report said 369 peoplewere killed in the nation's capital last year, while city policehave reported 372 were slain.   In second place among cities with populations of 400,000 or morewas Detroit with 57.9 killed per 100,000. Atlanta was third at48.8, according to calculations based on information in the report.   Among the 34 cities with at least 400,000 residents, the lowestmurder rate was in Honolulu, with 28 slayings for a rate of 3.3 per100,000 people. The second lowest was San Jose, Calif., with 37homicides for a rate of 5.1 per 100,000.
