 The software requiresVMS version 4.5 or later and must be used with at least the run-time versionof Progress, a 4GL database management package from Progress Software ofBedford, Mass., that is included with the Netman package.andM;Netman offers some appealing features, but its transition from PCs to the VAXworld has not been as smooth as we would have liked to see at DR Labs.andP;  Userswill occasionally be furstrated by awkard screens and some command keystrokesthan mean different things at different times.andP;  Some of CA-Netman/VAX's errormessages even refer to DOS, rather than VMS, as the user's operating system.andM;THE WHOLE PICTUREandM;Netman draws from an integrated base of &quot;master&quot; and &quot;transaction&quot; datafiles.andM;Master files contain the information that is used to validate all data in thetransaction files.andP;  Netman's primary master files include a Product File, aVendor/Manufacturer File, a Department File, a Product Category File and aCode File.andP;  As their names indicate, these files maintain information onspecific products, on product classification schemes (such as CPUs, monitorsand printers) and on product vendors.andM;Transaction files change much more frequently than master files.andP;  Essentialtransaction files in Netman are the Inventory File, the Configuration Fileand the Purchase Order File.andP;  These files are closely linked and shareinformation with each other.andM;The Inventory File contains information about each product being tracked inthe user's system, such as that product's location, the date it wasinstalled, and purchasing and warranty information.andM;The Configuration File, which is linked to the Inventory File, containsinformation about products grouped together as members of a &quot;configuration.&quot;andO;For instance, the CPU, monitor and keyboard of an employee's particular worksite would be defined as the members of a microcomputer configuration.andM;The Purchase Order File contains the purchasing and receiving information:the product number, the quantity that was ordered and the date the order wasreceived.andM;Using Netman's nested menus and function keys, users can update master andtransaction files, perform inquiries and generate a variety of reports.andP;  Inaddition, Netman allows users to generate and store memos and specific actionrequests.andM;AN EYE ON THINGSandM;After installing Netman and Progress using the standard VMSINSTAL commandprocedure, we were able to get started by simply typing NETMAN at the DCLprompt.andP;  From Netman's top-level menu we chose the Utilities option, which isused to initialize a new database.andM;The we performed some preliminary administrative functions.andP;  First we set uplogins and passwords for those users who would be allowed to access thedatabase.andM;Next, we customized some of the Netman global settings, such as the prefixfor our inventory tags and the beginning and ending dates of our fiscal year.andO;We were even able to instruct Netman to automatically generate the numbersthat would label our equipment configurations.andM;Once the database is initialized and loaded, users are returned to Netman'smain menu, where options include Inventory Management, Purchasing andReceiving, Help Desk, Training and Support Library, Management Analysis andMaster Files, as well as Utilities (Fig.andP;  1).andM;The Inventory Management option allows users to maintain and monitor theInventory file.andP;  Netman organizes inventory information into several majorcategories: product data, purchasing data, usage data, and warranty andmaintenance data (Fig.andP;  2).andM;As information is added to the Inventory File, Netman uses its master filesto validate this information.andP;  If a user enters data that is not recognizedby Netman, such as an undefined vendor name, Netman will respond with anappropriate message.andP;  In some cases, users may wish to add the new vendorname to the appropriate master file.andP;  Netman's convenient Remote Add functionkey lets users add new records to the master files while they are still in atransaction file.andM;Because transaction files are so dependent on the master files, great caremust be taken to design and implement consistent and meaningful codingschemes for the master files in Netman.andM;For example, it would probably be risky to define &quot;PC&quot; as a category, becausethis would incorporate individual PC components--such as CPUs ormonitors--into that single category, and a user running a report based uponthe PC category would have no way of determining what CPUs or monitors wereavailable.andM;The Inventory and Configuration files are linked by a &quot;configuration code&quot;field that is common to both.andP;  While the Inventory File maintains records foreach item in the system, the Configuration File maintains records forconfigured systems.andM;The Configuration File contains descriptive information, user contactinformation, price information and usage information, as well as a detailedcomponent list of each configuration (Fig.andP;  3).andM;The Configuration File's detailed component list is generated automaticallyas items are added to Netman's Inventory File.andP;  As each item is recorded inthe Inventory File, it can be assigned the code number of the configurationto which it will be added.andP;  Based on this common link, the item isautomatically added to the item list in the Configuration File.andM;The Purchasing and Receiving option of Netman's main menu is particularlyuseful.andP;  It lets users record purchasing or ordering information so that theycan keep track of purchase order numbers, items ordered, order dates andcost.andP;  Data entered in this file, like data entered in any of Netman's othertransaction files, is checked against data in the master files.andM;When items that have been ordered finally arrive, users can modify thedatabase to indicate that these products have been received.andP;  Netman thenautomatically updates the Inventory File to reflect the addition of these newiAn example of ttems to inventory.andM;An example of the bumpy transition from DOS to VMS appeared when we used thePurchasing and Receiving menu option.andP;  After updating the Purchase/OrderFile, we were unable to save the record.andP;  Netman was trying to use a DOSapproach to determine available disk space to save a data file rather thanthe appropriate VMS routine.andP;  Fortunately, when we contacted Netman's supportteam, they were able to provide a quick solution to the problem.andM;Netman's Help Desk menu option facilitates two-way communication betweenusers through memoranda and specific action requests.andM;The Memo File Maintenance option at the Help Desk menu lets users compose andprint memos with designated address labels, allowing users to target memodistribution.andP;  These memos, which are simply records in the memo file, can besave, reused, modified or deleted.andM;The Help Desk also allows users to request specific action through the ActionRequest File.andP;  Users can report broken equipment to maintenance personnelwith this utility, for example.andP;  These &quot;request tickets&quot; can be printed withappropriate address labels.andM;Once someone responds to a request, the action request record can be modifiedto indicate that the problem has been resolved.andP;  This utility is especiallyuseful for keeping track of the frequency and magnitude of system failures,as well as the time that is required for repairs.andM;The Training and Support Library is a useful utility that allows users tostore and retrieve information regarding training and support for inventoriedproducts.andM;Netman users can check the library for notes regarding specified products.andO;The library includes training notes (classes, books, contact people, etc.),andO;support notes (phone numbers) and product notes (tips and clues fromexperienced users).andM;The Management Analysis report generator helps users take a closer look atexpenditures, maintenance and resource utilization.andP;  Users can choose fromseveral kind of reports and breakdowns to create the output they need.andM;The Master Files menu provides direct access to the master files, includingthe Product File, the Vendor/Manufacturer File, the Department File, the CodeFile and the Product Category File.andP;  This gives users a quick and efficientmethod for adding, modifying or deleting records in these files.andM;Finally, the Utilities menu lets users store printer definitions in a printerfile.andP;  Users can then select desired printer definitions to meet theirspecific printing needs.andM;The Utilities menu also allows users to run Progress query programs, if theProgress query option is installed.andP;  This option can be purchased fromComputer Associates for 10 percent of the installed price of Netman.andM;Netman provides solid inquiry and report utilities.andP;  Users can generateinquiries and reports for all of Netman's master and transaction files.andO;Netman offers myriad search fields for inquiries (Fig.andP;  4) and allows usersto output the results to their terminal screen or to a printer (Fig.andP;  5).andM;Netman is equally generous with reports, generating both summary and detailreports upon command.andP;  Summary reports display only a limited number offields for each record matching the query, while detail reports list everyfield for each reported record.andP;  Report output can be directed to a printeror to a text file.andM;Although the reports provide an abundance of information, they requireprinters that can print 220 characters on one line--something many VAXprinters aren't capable of doing.andM;Netman also offers several useful features that make it easier to use thedatabase.andP;  Most notable are the &quot;power steering&quot; function keys and the RemoteAdd key.andP;  The &quot;power steering&quot; keys (andless;Scroll Currentandgt;, andless;Scroll Otherandgt; andandless;Zoomandgt;) allow users to move between files, examine records, and select reportor inquiry criteria based on fields in other records.andP;  The Remote Add keyallows users to modify a master file from within a transaction file.andM;Netman provides a measure of assistance to users through documentation andon-line help.andP;  The documentation, which contains a tutorial, is helpful butdifficult to follow at times.andP;  With the on-line help utility, users canquickly retrieve useful information about Netman.andP;  The on-line help utilityalso contains an option that allows users to toggle between Netman and theVMS operating system.andM;A FEW KINKSandM;This early version of Netman isn't perfect.andP;  The problems that we encounteredranged from small inconveniences to more serious flaws.andM;We were immediately puzzled and concerned by Netman's privilege requirements.andO;To run Netman, users must have ALTPRI, SYSGBL and SYSLCK privileges.andP;  Mostsystem managers at large installations would be reluctant to assign theseprivileges to a large group of users.andM;Netman's technical support staff informed us that Computer Associates has apatch that assigns privileges to the Netman installed image rather than theuser's individual process.andP;  This patch is available from the vendor uponrequest.andM;Navigating through Netman's menus and screens can be a challenge.andP;  Theirdesign is somewhat clumsy and inconsistent.andP;  Exiting from a menu ofteninvolves &quot;backing out&quot; through severl screens.andP;  For instance, when a user isin the memo file, he or she can only save changes made to the file if itsfirst page is on the terminal screen.andP;  We created a multipage memorandum andfound that, in order to save the memo, we had to backtrack through every pageuntil we had returned to the first.andM;Another inconvenience is Netman's reaction to what usually serves as thescreen-refresh command (andless;controlandgt; W).andP;  When users enter andless;Controlandgt; W, Netmanbrings up its on-line help facility.andP;  They must exit from this screen inorder to get back to the screen they were working on.andM;Finally, we examined the product's printer file and were dismayed to findthat no VAX printers are defined.andM;Although our excitement about this package was tempered by its cumbersomemigration to the VAX, Netman remains an innovative system.andP;  Future VAXreleases should aid in shedding Netman's image as a PC product trying to fitinto a VAX package.andM;We hope that this innovative package is enhanced in future VAX releases so asto remove these problems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
