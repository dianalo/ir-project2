Ernest Beazley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MIN CMD </IN><TEXT>   The nation's steel industry is expected to report its best quarterly earnings since 1979 for the first quarter.    The consensus among analysts is that the six largest U.S. steelmakers earned about $450 million in the quarter, compared with break-even results a year ago. Both periods include non-steel earnings and are adjusted for one-time items.    &quot;They're blowouts -- well above anything the companies had forecast,&quot; says Charles Bradford, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analyst, who like other analysts looks for continued improvement in the second quarter, before a mild slowdown in the seasonally weak second half.    The latest sign of the industry's turn of luck came Tuesday, when Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's No. 3 steelmaker, said it would repay $22.5 million in arrears to holders of two preferred stock issues. Bethlehem cited its stronger balance sheet and improved outlook.    The immediate horizon looks bright. Steel mills are running flat out. Shipments in the first two months of the year jumped 19%, while orders -- a key barometer of demand -- remained strong. PaineWebber Inc. estimates that March orders rose to 6.9 million tons from 6.6 million tons in February.    Several factors account for the torrid pace. Quotas on foreign steel, coupled with higher demand and capacity cuts, are fueling deep shortages in many steel products. A weak dollar, too, has sparked a rebound in manufacturing and capital goods, filling up order books.    Consequently, prices have soared. John Jacobson, a steel economist, estimates that the composite price of steel will jump 8% this year to $518 a ton from $480 in 1987. In the spot, or non-contract market, though, and in certain grades of steel, price increases have been much steeper.    Shortages of semi-finished, plate and hot-rolled sheet persist. Shipments of plate, used for construction and shipbuilding, soared 71% in the first two months of the year, but buyers still complain of long lag times between order and delivery.    One trend that has analysts worried, though, is continued inventory-building. Customers ran their stocks down in late 1986, anticipating discounts. When prices rose instead, panicked buyers set about rebuilding inventories, often as hedges against still higher prices.    Stocks at service centers -- middlemen that warehouse and process metal -- have risen for seven consecutive months, and inventories today are at their highest level of the decade. Should the economy weaken, buyers will quickly rein in orders, thus depressing prices.    &quot;What worries me is the general buildup in inventories -- that always comes back to haunt you,&quot; says Merrill's Mr. Bradford. &quot;The question is whether it's going to hurt the second half or the first half of next year.&quot;    Second-half results may also soften due to a seasonal downturn in demand. Orders from autos, construction and capital goods industries -- key steel markets -- typically surge in late winter and spring as the industries gear up for peak production, then fall off sharply during the summer.    Thus, prices may have already peaked for the year, and some analysts and economists think they will slip a bit after the first half. John Tumazos, Oppenheimer andamp; Co.'s steel analyst, for instance, foresees a 10%-15% fall this summer in both orders and spot prices.    &quot;I think we're in for a classic seasonal slowdown, but not a severe downturn,&quot; Mr. Tumazos says.    One wild card is the continuing contract talks with General Motors Corp., the industry's No. 1 customer, on its 1989 model year deliveries. Despite tight demand, steel executives are counting on no more than a 1%-2% price increase from GM, in line with recent Chrysler Corp. contracts. Though that's an improvement, it's far less than some analysts were predicting last fall.    Still, quotas and the weak dollar, which continues to improve the balance of trade in manufactured goods, seem likely to moderate any downturn. Moreover, although some buyers already sense a slight easing in demand, few signs of real softness are emerging.    &quot;It's certainly not apparent yet in the companies' third-quarter order books,&quot; says Walter Carter, a Data Resources economist.    ---                     Steel's Profit Rebound                    Operating Profit            Industry                     Per Ton Shipped           Shipments                 Average of 6 majors           (Millions                              (Loss)            of tons)    1986    1st Quarter                 $(14)               18.4    2nd Quarter                   (5)               18.5    3rd Quarter                  (26)               16.8    4th Quarter                   19                16.0    1987 -    1st Quarter                  $20                17.4    2nd Quarter                   18                19.2    3rd Quarter                   23                19.4    4th Quarter                   34                20.7    1988*    1st Quarter                  $41                20.3    2nd Qurater                   49                20.7    3rd Quarter                   38                18.0    4th Quarter                   38                19.0    *Estimate    Sources: Oppenheimer and Co.; American Iron and Steel Institute</TEXT></DOC>
