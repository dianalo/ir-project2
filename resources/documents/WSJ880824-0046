Inc., Twinsburg, Ohio, said it obtained a $145 million credit facility that will enable the drugstore chain to build needed inventories for the holiday selling period.    The new facility, approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron, will replace an interim $50 million financing agreement approved earlier this month, both from a bank group led by Wells Fargo Bank and Marine Midland Bank. Revco filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy-law protection in July.    The facility, which is expected to close Sept. 8 and runs through Feb. 1, 1990, contains special provisions for vendors extending normal trade terms. Trade creditors who extend customary payment terms to Revco after the company's bankruptcy filing will receive the same super-priority claim and lien as the bank group providing the financing. </TEXT></DOC>
