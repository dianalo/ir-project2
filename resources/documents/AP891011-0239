Machinists could resume within a week, a key union leader says.   There have been no talks since some 57,800 Machinists left theirjobs on Oct. 4.   Federal mediator Doug Hammond has been in daily contact withboth sides and will call for talks ``when he gets a signal ... afeeling that there's a reason to call the parties together,'' saidTom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751.   ``I think that within a week, we'll see that process starting,''Baker said Tuesday.   The last Boeing strike was a 45-day walkout by the Machinists in1977, and ``two months is not really long'' for the aerospaceindustry, Baker said.   Boeing on Tuesday delivered the third jetliner it has completedsince the walkout began. It was a 747-400 received by QantasAirways Ltd. of Australia.   The company said another three dozen or so might be completed bysupervisors and Machinists crossing picket lines.   Meanwhile, Boeing's second-largest union, the 27,000-personSeattle Professional Engineering Employees Association, voted toseek a 14 percent wage increase when its talks begin Monday.   So far, the Machinists' walkout has not strained relations withairlines and jet leasing companies, despite worldwide pressure toreplace aging aircraft with quieter, more technologically advancedand fuel-efficient models, Boeing spokesman Harold Carr saidTuesday.   ``They understand it's just one of those facts of doingbusiness,'' he said.   He said about three dozen aircraft were on the ``flight lines,''with almost all basic assembly completed. Each still requiresexhaustive calibration of instruments, testing and ``maybe a littletouch-up work'' normally done by the strikers, Carr said.   ``They go all the way from within days to two months or so''away from delivery, he said.   After five consecutive years of record orders, Boeing has abacklog stretching into the late 1990s.   In completing aircraft for delivery, ``the initial concentrationis on the flight lines,'' Carr said.   Another 28 or 29 planes are in various stages of assembly on the737 and 757 lines in Renton and the 747 and 767 lines in Everett,but they probably cannot be completed without major defections fromunion ranks, Carr said.   ``It's unrealistic to think you can replace 43,000 skilledpeople,'' he said.   Boeing's offer, spurned by Machinists in an 85 percent strikevote Oct. 3, featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 3percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, bonuses of 8 percent ofworker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990, acost-of-living clause to virtually match inflation, a reduction inmandatory overtime and increases in some benefits.   Baker's local represents about 43,300 Boeing workers in Seattleand its suburbs. Another 12,000 or so work in Wichita, Kan., 1,700in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others at sites in severalother states.   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for thefirst half of 1989 and reported $614 million in profits on $16.96billion in sales in 1988.   In a meeting Monday night, members of the engineers andtechnical workers group adopted as bargaining goals wage increasesof 14 percent in the first year, 9 percent in the second year, 8percent in the first half of the third year and 4 percent in thesecond half of the final year, plus quarterly cost-of-livingadjustments and an unspecified lump-sum bonus.   Engineers and technical workers, bound by a no-strike clause ina contract expiring Dec. 1, have been crossing the Machinists'picket lines while refusing to do work normally done by thestrikers.   The current three-year contract boosted wages by 3 percent, 2percent and 2 percent for engineers and 2 percent, 2 percent and 3percent for technical workers. Engineers also got a one-time 9percent bonus and technical employees bonuses of 5 percent thefirst year and nearly 3 percent in each of the next two years.</TEXT></DOC>
