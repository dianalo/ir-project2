KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four people shouting ``burn, baby, burn'' setfire Monday to three American flags on the steps of the U.S.Capitol in an attempt to force a court test on theconstitutionality of a new law banning flag desecration.   ``We defy your law,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Kent.   ``We challenge you. Arrest us. Test your statute. Take it backto the Supreme Court and try once again to claim it is allconsistent with your constitutional standards of free speech.''   One of those arrested was Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson, whose 1984arrest for burning a flag at the Republican National Convention inDallas set in motion the court case that led to the new law.   Another was Scott Tyler, 24, who stirred controversy in Chicagoearlier this year by placing a flag on the floor as part of astudent exhibit at the School of the Art Institute.   Capitol police charged Johnson, 33, of Richmond, Ind., Tyler andtwo others with violating the Flag Protection Act of 1989,demonstrating without a permit and disorderly conduct, said policespokesman Dan Nichols.   The other two were identified as Shawn Eichner, 24, of New YorkCity, and David Blalock, 39, of Johnstown, Pa.   Coincidentally, the 1984 flag burning charge against Johnson wasofficially dismissed on Monday by Dallas County Criminal Judge JohnHendrik, who acted after receiving the official order from theTexas Court of Criminal Appeals ordering him to do so.   The demonstration came two days after members of a radicalVietnam veterans' group in Seattle, Wash., burned a full-sizeAmerican flag and 1,000 paper flags to protest the law.   President Bush, who favors a constitutional amendment to protectthe flag, allowed the measure to become law without his signature.It went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.   It provides punishment of up to one year in jail and a $1,000fine for anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physicallydefiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples uponany flag of the United States.''   The Supreme Court sparked the controversy earlier this year bydeclaring an existing law aimed at protecting the flag to be anunconstitutional intrusion on free speech. Johnson had beenconvicted under that law.   Flags were burned in several cities shortly after the new lawwent into effect. U.S. Attorney Mike McKay said in Seattle that theFBI is investigating the flag burning there to determine if acriminal complaint is warranted.   Monday's flag-burning had been scheduled for in front of theSupreme Court, but organizers led photographers and televisioncameras to the Capitol steps.   One demonstrator produced a flag and ripped it in two. Twopolice officers struggled with him and tore the pieces of thebanner from his hands.   Behind them, another man produced a flag and set it afire.   Two other flags also were set ablaze, crumbling into bits ofcharred cloth as the four demonstrators chanted: ``Burn, baby,burn. Burn, baby, burn.''   ``One shouted: ``Stop the fascist flag law. Oppose it.''   ``I'm a Vietnam veteran and I am burning this flag,'' saidanother. ``We saw what this country is.''   Police tried to extinguish the flames by stamping on the flags,then aimed fire extinguishers at the burning remnants, dousing themin a chemical stream and shrouding the scene in white smoke.   ``This law enshrines the American flag as a sacred symbol abovecriticism,'' Miss Kent read from a prepared statement. ``We refuseto be silent in the face of such an attempt by the government todictate the bounds of speech, protest and artistic expression.''   David Cole, a staff attorney for the Center for ConstitutionalRights who has represented Johnson, said the ``new statute is justas unconstitutional as the old law.''</TEXT></DOC>
