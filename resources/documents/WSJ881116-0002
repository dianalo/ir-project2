In interbank markets, the cost of overnight funds jumped almost five percentage points to 20% yesterday, Oslo bankers said. One-month Eurokroner credits rose an equal amount to 18.08% before easing slightly late in the day.    Despite the market rates explosion, Norway's central bank left unchanged at 12.4% the official interest rate it charges on overnight lending to banks.    Meanwhile, the krone firmed, closing unchanged at 114.3 against a trade-weighted index of 14 international currencies. That still is near the weakest end of the index zone maintained by the central bank and a slide from the krone's 113.47 value Friday.    But currency traders said the central bank wasn't as active in foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying less than 1 billion kroner to support the Norwegian currency. During the preceeding two sessions, central bank interventions totaled an estimated 12 billion kroner, bankers said.    Barring a new burst of speculation, &quot;There are signs that this may be culminating,&quot; said Tormod Andreassen, executive vice president of Christiania Bank andamp; Kredit kassen, Norway's biggest bank. The interest-rate increase squeezes foreign investors who speculate with short positions, hoping to make a profit by buying currency at a lower price later to repay credits. </TEXT></DOC>
