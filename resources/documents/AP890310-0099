Sam Nunn, fresh from the bitter debateover the nomination of John Tower to head the Pentagon, called todayfor a cooling of ``the passions that are now bubbling inWashington.''   ``We cannot prevail as a great power if either our allies or ouradversaries look to Washington and see endless division and rancorinstead of a principled, unified American policy,'' said Nunn.   As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the GeorgiaDemocrat led the successful fight to defeat the Tower nomination.   He struck a conciliatory note in a speech opening the annualconference of the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization ofcentrist Democrats who banded together four years ago to halt whatthey saw as a leftward drift of their national party.   The current chairman of the DLC, Nunn opened the meeting with agrim message: ``In presidential elections, the Republicans are nowthe de facto majority party.''   Nunn cited what he called the successes of the DLC and said,``Our progress has been overshadowed by a larger failure _ thecollective failure of Democrats to reverse our party's dismal recordin national presidential elections.''   The Democrats have lost five of the last six presidentialelections.   He went on to say that when legislative seats are realigned in1991 to reflect populations shifts, the situation ``can only getworse'' for Democrats.   Census projections indicate a continued shift of House seats fromNorthern industrial states to the Sunbelt, from traditionallyDemocratic strongholds to areas of emerging Republican strength.   Nunn came to the conference following the 53-47 Senate voterejecting President Bush's nomination of Tower. It was the firsttime the Senate had turned down a nominee for a president's initialCabinet and it came after a bitter, often highly partisan debate.   ``I hope the passions that are now bubbling in Washington willsoon cool,'' said Nunn, ``and we can get on with thr business offorging a defense and foreign policy that is supported by the mainelements of both political parties.''   Nunn went on to say that ``our nation cannot afford a separateDempcratic and Republican foreign policy on issues as important asarms control, relations with the Soviet Union and the future ofLatin America.''</TEXT></DOC>
