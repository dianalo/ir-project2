Efforts to duplicate the findingshave had varied success and many scientists are skeptical of the claim.;    &quot;Ihave always agreed to release any data -- provided that patent attorneysconsented to the release, that reviewers signed confidential agreements andthat it didn't violate any contractual agreement with the university orviolate any federal law,&quot; Pons said.;    Pons, who spoke by phone from anundisclosed location, said he and Fleischmann have refused to release data toWill because he hasn't adhered to confidentiality agreements.;    Will said hebelieved Pons was referring to incidents in which data were given to aninstitute consultant and shown to General Electric officials. In both cases,he said, confidentiality agreements were strictly observed.;    About $922,000remains of the $5 million allocated by the state for cold-fusion research.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Salt Lake City  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910111  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  304  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, January 11, 199100011201,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
