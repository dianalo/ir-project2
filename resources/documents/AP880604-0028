A Defense Ministry statement said two Honduran army troopscarrying M-16 rifles were caught near the town of Teotecacinte innorthern Nuevo Segovia province, more than a mile inside Nicaragua.   The statement identified the two as Gilberto Moncada Miranda andGustavo Adolfo Caliz Gamero of Honduras' 6th Infantry Battalion,based in Aguas Calientes, Honduras.   It said the soldiers ``were found doing intelligence work in ourterritory'' and called the incident an ``open violation of nationalsecurity.''   There was no immediate comment from the Honduran government.   The incident followed an exchange of accusations betweenNicaragua and Honduras earlier in the week over fighting betweenSandinista troops and U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels based inHonduras.   On Wednesday, the Sandinista government denied Honduran claimsthat its soldiers crossed into Honduras to attack a border post.   The Honduran armed forces had said a number of Sandinista troopswere killed in the fighting, and Honduran Foreign Minister CarlosLopez protested the incident.   Nicaragua said an army patrol was attacked inside Nicaragua by agroup of Contra rebels based in Honduras and that a Sandinista armysoldier was captured and taken to a post six miles inside Honduras.   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto protested the``crude manipulation of the facts'' to Lopez and accused Hondurasof trying ``to create an incident between Honduras and Nicaragua.''   The body of Porfirio Cruz Lopez, a Sandinista army soldiermortally wounded in the May 31 fighting with rebels, was returnedFriday to Nicaragua from Honduras at the Las Manos border post inNueva Segovia.   No Honduran military officials were present when the casketcontaining Cruz Lopez's remains arrived in Las Manos.   A Sandinista military delegation received the remains.   Also Friday, the rebels' military leader said the leftistgovernment violated a temporary cease-fire in at least 30 recentattacks against Contra forces in the southeastern part of thecountry.   Enrique Bermudez, speaking on the rebels' clandestine RadioLiberacion, said the Contras suffered six casualties. He did notelaborate.   The Defense Ministry issued a statement saying six rebels werekilled in recent days in northern Nicaragua after Contra forcesattacked army troops who were abiding by the cease-fire.   Bermudez said in a broadcast monitored in the capital city ofManagua that the fighting could affect the next round of peacetalks scheduled to begin Tuesday between high-level government andContra officials.   The two sides signed a preliminary peace accord March 23 andagreed on a 60-day truce to give them time to negotiate a permanentend to the 6{-year-old war.   The truce expired on Tuesday, but both sides agreed to extend ituntil the next round of negotiations. President Daniel Ortegapreviously had announced a unilateral 30-day extension.   Bermudez, a former National Guard colonel during thedictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, took part in the last round ofpeace negotiations in Managua held May 26-28. The Sandinistasblamed his presence in the rebel delegation for the failure of thetalks to produce concrete results.   In the radio broadcast, Bermudez said the Sandinista attacks onthe rebels occurred in the southeastern provinces of Chontales andRio San Juan.   The Defense Ministry statement said the Contra attacks werecarried out in Nueva Segovia and Jinotega provinces.</TEXT></DOC>
