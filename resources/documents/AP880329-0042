(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 200 Dartmouth College faculty membersendorsed a statement by the college president accusing aconservative student newspaper of ``poisoning the intellectualenvironment of our campus.''   During a special faculty meeting Monday, Dartmouth PresidentJames Freedman branded the staff of the off-campus weekly TheDartmouth Review as ``ideological provocateurs posing asjournalists.''   Chris Whitman, a junior who became the Review's editor onMonday, called Freedman's criticisms unfair.   The Review has been at the center of controversy since it wasfounded in 1980. It has been attacked as anti-minority, anti-womenand anti-homosexual and has been championed by such conservativesas William F. Buckley Jr. and former White House communicationschief Patrick Buchanan.   Freedman's public criticism of the Review, the strongest to dateby any high Dartmouth official, came weeks after three Reviewstaffers were suspended and a fourth was put on probation for theirrole in an angry confrontation with a black professor described bythe Review as incompetent.   Freedman, who became Dartmouth's president eight months ago,said he decided to speak out against the paper ``because I now seethat the Review is dangerously affecting _ in fact, poisoning _ theintellectual environment of our campus.''   The president said the college ``must not stand by silently whena newspaper maliciously engages in bullying tactics that seemvirtually designed to have the effect of discouraging women andmembers of minority groups from joining our faculty or enrolling asstudents.   ``What the Review has done on this campus has not been decent.What it has done has been irresponsible, mean-spirited, cruel andugly,'' he said.   About 200 teachers at the faculty meeting gave Freedman astanding ovation and approved a resolution endorsing his remarks.   Whitman said the Review is not ``anti-diversity.'' He saidstudents of many races and persuasions are or have been on thestaff.   ``I think we're aggressive, we pursue investigative stories, butI do not consider us ideological provocateurs or mean-spirited,''Whitman said. ``I think we have an unquestioned right to evaluatethe faculty n a consumer-advocacy role.''   As Freedman spoke, college spokesmen handed out a statementsaying that Dean Edward Shanahan had denied the four Reviewstaffers' requests for reconsideration of their disciplinary casesstemming from the Feb. 25 confrontation with Professor William Cole.   The students were charged with harassment, invasion of privacyand disorderly conduct after they confronted Cole in his classroomto offer him a chance to rebut an article that had harshlycriticized him.   The college's statement also noted that Review staffers in 1986were involved in a nighttime sledgehammer attack on symbolicanti-apartheid shanties on the college green.</TEXT></DOC>
