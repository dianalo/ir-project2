The computer will not be entirely new, and it will not beavailable until the end of the year, but analysts saw it as apsychological victory for IBM, which has been upstaged repeatedly byrival Compaq Computer Corp.   ``Compaq must really have bugged them. They have gotten tired ofCompaq beating them to the market with the latest chip or thefastest chip,'' said Jonathan Seybold, publisher of Seybold Reportsin Malibu, Calif.   ``This is a shot across the bow from IBM, that's about it,'' saidRichard Shaffer, editor of Computer Letter in New York.   IBM said it will sell a $3,995 circuit board containing Intel'snew i486 chip. The board will replace the microprocessor in one ofIBM's Personal System-2 Model 70-A21 computers, making it run twiceas fast as the fastest personal computers available today, IBM said.   The circuit board will go on sale as soon as the chips areavailable from Intel, which is expected to be the final quarter ofthis year. The price of the computer they go into was cut to $8,995from $11,295.   Compaq said the announcement is unimportant because the computerthe new chip will go into _ the Model 70-A21 _ lacks the memorycapacity and room for add-on equipment that Compaq's ownhigh-powered models have.   The limitations mean the computer cannot take full advantage ofthe new i486 chip's power for such jobs as computer-aided design andengineering.   Compaq faulted IBM for announcing the product before it is ready.It is ``absolutely'' possible that Compaq will begin delivering acomputer based on the i486 chip before IBM does, Michael Swavely,the president of Compaq North America, said in an interview.   ``Who announces first really doesn't matter a whole lot,''Swavely said.   In contrast, Robert Carberry, IBM's vice president for systems inthe personal computer organization, said, ``I think we're very wellpositioned'' to be the first to deliver a computer based on the i486.   The Model 70-A21 was selected as the first housing for the i486chip because its design allows it to accept differentmicroprocessors easily. IBM said other members of its PS-2 familywould also be equipped with the new chip over time, although theupgrade will be more complex.   Ever since Compaq brought out the first 80386-based personalcomputer in 1986, IBM has been trying to catch up in unit shipmentsof those machines, which are the most powerful IBM-compatible onescurrently on the market.   IBM may hit No. 1 in the segment in the current April-Junequarter, David Thomas, president of IBM's National DistributionDivision, said in an interview Tuesday.   Analysts said that regardless of the technological significanceof IBM's announcement, they admired the competitive zeal IBM wasdisplaying.   ``I think it's a very clever idea,'' Seybold said.   Separately, IBM tried to steal some thunder from another rival,Apple Computer Inc., by announcing new products that allow people touse their personal computers as editing stations for video andsound. The hardware makes it possible for people to producemultimedia presentations on their desktop, IBM said.</TEXT></DOC>
