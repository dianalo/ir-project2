The forest products concern said year-end charges and acredit would combine to reduce 1991 net income by $344million, or $1.70, a share. Consequently, the company said itexpects to post a net loss for 1991 of about $170 million, or85 cents a share, compared with net of $394 million, or$1.87, a year earlier. The company indicated it broke even inthe fourth-quarter without the special charges, compared withnet of $58.8 million or 30 cents, a year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Weyerhaeuser cited the prolonged effect of the recessionon its commercial and residential real estate investments. Italso said new logging restrictions on federal land inhabitedby the endangered Northern spotted owl and the high costs ofupgrading aging mills and complying with environmental lawswould force the closure of several of its 60 mills in theU.S. Several hundred of its 39,500 employees are expected tolose their jobs, the company said, and about $14 million wascharged to severance pay and outplacement services.   The company said $52 million was charged to environmentalclean-up of contaminated water and soil around both operatingand closed plant sites. It also said it set aside $125million for post-retirement benefits and took a $64 millionincome-tax credit, reflecting accounting changes.   &quot;These actions should put a number of uncertainties behindus and allow the company to begin 1992 with a clean slate,&quot;John W. Creighton, Jr., president and chief executiveofficer, said in a prepared statement.   A spokesman added that the latest charges were an attemptto expedite a restructuring that began in 1989. It &quot;forces usto bite the bullet on some key business decisions,&quot; he said.&quot;It allows us to get these things behind us quickly.&quot;   In 1991, the industry was felled as housing starts hit a40-year low amid chronic, excess pulp and paper capacity.However, companies such as Weyerhaeuser, who own their owntimber holdings, have until now actually benefitted from thespotted owl flap, which has raised overall prices. Mostindustry analysts expect overall improvement this year as theeconomy improves, but not until the second half.   Dan Nelson, an analyst at Ragen McKenzie Inc. in Seattle,said the company's sweeping changes &quot;show that Weyerhaeuseris cleaning up its income statement and developing a moreprofitable business.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Weyerhaeuser closed at$28.125, up 75 cents.   But announcement of the charges will probably surprisesome investors. In November, Weyerhaeuser told New Yorkanalysts that fourth-quarter results &quot;could be nearbreak-even.&quot; The latest announcement could hurt investorconfidence in the company, said George Haloulakos, an analystat Dain Bosworth Inc. in Seattle. &quot;It is going to put up abarrier, and the company doesn't need another barrier,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
