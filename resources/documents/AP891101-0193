Baker III toldForeign Minister Moshe Arens by telephone Wednesday that he hasrevised his Middle East peace offer following objections fromIsrael, an Israeli offical said.   Israel radio said the new draft, delivered to Arens Wednesdaynight by U.S. Ambassador William Brown, gave Israel assurances thatknown PLO members will be banned from talks, but left the door opento indirect PLO participation. .   The radio said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Finance MinisterShimon Peres, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Arens _ the fourtop leaders _ will meet Friday to discuss the modifications.   Israel radio also said Wednesday the army plans to begindeploying a reserve unit of Jewish settlers in the West Bank,breaking a ban against assigning settler units to the occupiedterritory.   The move immediately brought protests from left-wing legislatorswho complained use of settler companies could increase the violencein the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising.   Later Wednesday, Israeli TV, quoting defense sources, saidsettler reserve units would not be deployed in the West Bank,despite the previous reports.   An Israeli official confirmed Baker spoke to Arens on Wednesday.The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, refusedto provide details of the plan.   The reported changes in Baker's proposal calling for apreliminary meeting on Israel's election plan with a Palestiniandelegation came a week after Arens wrote the American officialasking for key changes in the U.S. proposal.   Arens insisted that Israel have the right to veto members of aPalestinian delegation if they are tied to the Palestine LiberationOrganization and that Israeli-Palestinian talks be limited to theIsraeli offer for elections in the occupied territories.   In the new draft, Baker said the Palestinian delegation maydiscuss the elections plan and the process of negotiations but notthe content of negotiations, reports on Israel and army radio said.   The reports said Baker also agreed to scrap the idea of ameeting among U.S., Israeli and Egyptian officials in Washington todiscuss the makeup of the Palestinian delegation.   Baker declined to give Israel a veto of individual members ofthe delegation but said Israel can refuse to attend the meeting ifthe Palestinian delegation is not acceptable, the reports said.   The use of the word ``acceptable'' was not a change from Baker'searlier plan, and the reported revised draft also seemed to fallshort of Arens' request that the PLO be banned from even indirectparticipation in the talks.   Since the start of the uprising in the occupied lands inDecember 1987, 607 Palestinians have been killed by Israelisoldiers and Jewish settlers. Forty Israelis also have died in theviolence.   In the occupied territories Wednesday, soldiers shot a maskedprotester in a demonstration and masked Palestinians beat andcritically injured a 60-year-old gas station attendant on suspicionof cooperating with Israel.   Palestinians have killed 138 of their fellow Arabs on suspicionof cooperating with Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
