McFarlanepleaded guilty Friday to misdemeanor charges that he misledCongress by assuring lawmakers the Reagan administration was nothelping arm Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on U.S. military aid.   President Reagan's former national security adviser pleadedguilty to four counts of withholding information from Congress whenquestioned about news reports that members of his staff,particularly Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, were helping to raise moneyand ship arms to the Contra rebels.   McFarlane, who agreed to cooperate fully with independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh's investigation, could be sentenced to upto four years imprisonment and fined as much as $400,000 for theguilty pleas he entered before U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.Robinson Jr.   Robinson released McFarlane on his own recognizance and did notschedule a sentencing date. McFarlane was subdued and spoke in asoft voice when responding to questions posed by the judge.   ``You understand that imprisonment could be consecutive?''Robinson said, referring to the option of making the four one-yearterms concurrent or consecutive.   ``I understand that,'' McFarlane said without showing anyemotion.   The judge later asked, ``Do you know any reason I should notaccept the plea?''   ``No,'' McFarlane said.   McFarlane played a major role in the Iran-Contra affair, evenafter he resigned as national security adviser in December 1985.The following May, he led a secret mission to Tehran to opencontact with so-called moderate Iranians who were thought to holdinfluence with kidnappers of American hostages. He brought with hima cake and a Bible signed by President Reagan.   McFarlane attempted suicide in February 1987 by taking anoverdose of a tranquilizer the day before he was scheduled totestify before a presidential commission investigating the affair.   President Reagan, leaving the White House Friday afternoon for ahelicopter trip to Camp David, Md., refused to comment onMcFarlane's plea.   ``It's in the court,'' he shouted to reporters.   North, who is expected to be indicted for his role in theIran-Contra affair, was asked by CBS News about McFarlane. ``Iwouldn't comment about Mr. McFarlane,'' North said. ``But as Ithink I told you once before, this Marine is never going to pleadguilty to any charge and I'll fight this or any other allegationsof misconduct forever.''   Earlier, in an impromptu news conference following the hearing,Walsh acknowledged that McFarlane could have been charged withperjury, a felony that carries a five-year sentence for each charge.   But Walsh said he agreed to the misdemeanor plea because of theformer national security adviser's willingness to cooperate withWalsh's investigation and his ``undisguised expressions of remorseafter the false testimony.''   ``He tried to correct his testimony and actually imposed injuryupon himself in a fit of depression,'' Walsh said of McFarlane'ssuicide attempt.   Walsh called McFarlane's guilty plea a ``very important''development in his 14-month investigation. In the coming weeks, theinvestigation is expected to yield a round of indictments againstNorth and others, including Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who wasMcFarlane's successor as national security adviser.   ``It furthers the work of the Office of Independent Counselbecause he has agreed to cooperate fully with our office in thepursuit of the remainder of our investigation,'' Walsh said.   McFarlane told reporters, ``I did indeed withhold informationfrom the Congress. I believe strongly that, throughout, my actionswere motivated by what I believed to be in the foreign policyinterest of the United States.''   After the Iran-Contra affair unraveled in late 1986, McFarlanesaid ``I believed profoundly that it was my personal obligation totestify voluntarily and fully to those bodies formally establishedto investigate this matter.''   In an interview later with NBC News, McFarlane sidestepped aquestion as to whether he thought President Reagan might pardon him.   ``That's not for me _ and I don't think it ought to be for theAmerican people _ the issue. I guess that's really my centralconcern (is) ... why this really happened, and to see if we can'tcorrect the way we do business between the president and theCongress so that this kind of thing doesn't happen again,''McFarlane said.   The charges involve statements that McFarlane made in three 1985letters to House committees and in testimony before the HouseForeign Affairs Committee on Dec. 8, 1986, when he denied knowingabout solicitations of donations to the Contras from anunidentified foreign country.   The charges involve assurances to Congress that NSC staffers,specifically North, were not involved in private efforts to helpthe Contras and that McFarlane knew of no foreign donations to therebels.   McFarlane admitted withholding information from the HousePermanent Select Committee on Intelligence in letters he wrote onSept. 5, 1985, and on Oct. 7, 1985, in response to queries aboutreports that his staff was secretly helping the Contras inviolation of the 1984 Boland Amendment's ban on direct or indirectmilitary aid to the rebels.   In the Oct. 7 letter, McFarlane wrote that ``Lieutenant ColonelNorth did not use his influence to facilitate the movement ofsupplies to the resistance.''   He further assured the panel in the letter that there was ``noofficial or unofficial relationship with any member of the NSCstaff regarding fund-raising for the Nicaraguan democraticopposition.''   ``This includes the alleged relationship with GeneralSinglaub,'' McFarlane said.   The letter was misleading, the charge said, because McFarlaneknew that North ``had used his influence to facilitate the movementof certain supplies to the Contras'' and he knew that ``a member ofthe NSC staff had had contact with retired Maj. Gen. John K.Singlaub regarding fund-raising for the Contras.''   In the Sept. 5 letter, McFarlane told the panel ``I can statewith deep personal conviction that at no time did I or any memberof the National Security Council staff violate the letter or thespirit of the law.''   ``We did not solicit funds or other support for military orparamilitary activities either from Americans or third parties,''he wrote.   He made a similar assurance in a Sept. 12, 1985, letter toformer Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., who then headed the HouseForeign Affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs.   The fourth charge relates to Dec. 8, 1986, testimony in whichMcFarlane told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he was notaware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helpingthe Contras.   ``The concrete character of that is beyond my ken,'' McFarlanetold the committee.   The charge noted that McFarlane was withholding the fact he wasaware that citizens of the unidentified country had been donatingmillions of dollars to the Contras. McFarlane also withheld thefact that he had provided a representative of the country with thenumber of a secret bank account where the funds could be deposited,the charge said.   McFarlane told the congressional Iran-Contra committees that asearly as May of 1984, he had met with the ambassador from what wascalled Country 2, which later was learned to be Bandar bin Sultanof Saudi Arabia.   The ambassador offered to provide $1 million a month to sustainthe Contras at a time their money was running out. McFarlane toldthe panels he had not solicited the money, but that it had beenoffered as a gift after he bemoaned the likelihood of the Reaganadministration winning additional Contra support from Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
