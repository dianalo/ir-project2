Material sampled includes air, water, milk,foods, vegetation, soil, fish, sediment, and direct radiation levels.The exposures calculated from environmental samples were contributedby naturally occurring radioactive materials, from materials commonlyfound in the environment as a result of atmospheric fallout, or fromthe operation of other nuclear facilities in the area. Since WBN hasnot operated, there has been no contribution of radioactivity from theplant to the environment. 4 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
