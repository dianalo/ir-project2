The U.S. Army Laboratory Command, Harry Diamond Laboratories intendsto prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the relocation,upgrade and operation of certain electromagnetic pulse (EMP) simulatorsfrom the Woodbridge Research Facility, Woodbridge, VA, and the constructionand operation of a new EMP simulator, VEMPS II. The U.S. Army LaboratoryCommand has terminated EMP simulator operations at the Woodbridge ResearchFacility, Woodbridge, VA. This notice supercedes the Notice of Intent toPrepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the operation of ElectromagneticPulse Simulators (EMP) at the Harry Diamond Laboratories, Woodbridge ResearchFacility, Woodbridge, VA, published by the Department of the Army on January12, 1989, in 54 FR 994.The U.S. Army Laboratory Command, Department of the Army, is responsiblefor research, test, and evaluation of the effects of EMP on Army equipment.EMP is generated by the employment of nuclear weapons at high altitudeand can render equipment inoperative because of its effect on electricalcircuits and electronic components. EMP simulators produce only the EMPportion of a nuclear detonation without the use of any nuclear weapons,nuclear material, or nuclear radiation. Possible alternatives include:a. Cease this type of testing, orb. Conduct such testing by other means of simulation, orc. Have other military, Federal departments or contractors conduct suchtesting, ord. Relocate and operate those simulators at a number of undetermined, reasonablesites.It is anticipated that the Army's EIS effort will be augmented by the servicesof contractors, consultants, and advisors with demonstrated expertise andexperience to accumulate the necessary information to make the appropriateanalysis.2. The environmental impact analysis process will be in accordance withthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Army Regulation 220-2, 32CFR part 651 and the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality,40 CFR part 1500. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the extentof any significant impacts, and in the event significant impacts exist,to analyze those impacts under the terms of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 and to explore mitigation for any significant impacts.3. The Army will initiate a scoping process to discuss reasonable sitingalternatives and to determine the significant issues related to the proposedaction. Following the development of a list of alternate sites, the EISprocess will begin with public scoping meetings, which will be announcedin the <T2>Federal Register</T2> at least two weeks in advance of the meetings.Public as well as Federal, State, and local agency participation and inputare desired. To provide an opportunity for public input to the scopingprocess, interested individuals, governmental agencies and private organizationsare invited to submit information and comments for consideration by theArmy and possible incorporation into the EIS. Particularly solicited isinformation on other environmental studies, issues and alternatives whichthe EIS should consider, major impacts and recommended mitigating measuresassociated with the proposed action.4. Individuals or agencies may offer information relevant to the environmentalimpacts or aspects of the environment that should be considered by writingto or participating in public scoping meetings which will be held in January1990. Notice will also be mailed to groups and individuals, agencies andanyone responding to this Notice of Intent desiring to be informed on thedetails of the upcoming public participating meetings. Questions and commentsregarding the scope of the environmental analysis and documentation shouldbe submitted to the Harry Diamond Laboratories Public Affairs Officer:Director, U.S. Army Laboratory Command, Harry Diamond Laboratories, ATTN:Public Affairs Officer, 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783-1145;Area Code (202) 39402208.Comments and suggestions should be received no later than 15 days followingthe public scoping meetings to be considered in the Draft EIS (DEIS).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lewis D.
