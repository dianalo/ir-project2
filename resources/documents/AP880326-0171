LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors probing accusations ofwidespread government corruption said Friday that they areexamining secret bank accounts belonging to the brother of formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan.   Hundreds of students at three universities stagedanti-government rallies, with many protesting the allegedcorruption. Violent clashes broke out as students hurled rocks andfirebombs and fought with riot police.   Prosecutor-General Lee Chong-nam said investigators have locatedsecret bank accounts used by Chun's younger brother, ChunKyung-hwan. Lee said the younger Chun would be questioned soonabout whether he misappropriated funds of the semi-official Saemauldevelopment movement he once headed.   Prosecutor Kang Won-il said officials had seized secret ledgersshowing how Chun Kyung-hwan and other top Saemaul officials haddiverted funds.   The ongoing investigation now centers on charges the youngerChun embezzled $8 million under a false name to invest in stocks,Kang said.   ``Considerable progress has been made in the prosecutioninvestigation on Chun's alleged embezzlement and receiving of moneythrough influence peddling,'' Kang said.   A probe into the activities of Saemaul movement has revealedwidespread corruption, embezzlement and influence peddling.Officials believe huge sums of money, land and other property wereembezzled.   The Saemaul movement was set up in 1971 to organize rural andurban development and modernization. Saemaul means ``NewCommunity.''   About 200 Saemaul and government officials have been questionedabout diverting funds, selling influence, extorting donations andother crimes, according to the prosecutor-general's office.   Prosecutors are investigating charges government officials wereinvolved in corruption or helped to cover it up to protectPresident Chun and his family.   The younger Chun, who was named to head Saemaul while hisbrother was president, resigned in 1987 after being linked togangsters. He tried to flee to Japan last week, but returned Sundayto face questioning.   President Roh Tae-woo, who took over from the elder Chun on Feb.25, promised before he was elected in December that hisadministration would put an end to high-level corruption.   In Seoul, riot police firing tear gas thwarted ananti-government and anti-U.S. demonstration by about 300 radicalstudents who tried to march out of Yonsei University.   The Korean news agency Yonhap said about 1,000 students clashedwith riot police firing tear gas at two separate universities inKwangju.   Kwangju was the scene of a bloody nine-day anti-governmentinsurrection in 1980. At least 191 people were killed and more than800 others injured in the uprising, the worst in modern SouthKorean history.  </TEXT></DOC>
