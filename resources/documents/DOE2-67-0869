It was more effective than the wild strainin the delignification of woody materials (beech, pine and poplar tree).Growth of P1/sub 3/-M/sub 6/ on barley straw increased the digestibilityof this lignocellulosic substrate. Furthermore, P1/sub 3/-M/sub 6/ wasmore effective in decolorizing black kraft mill effluent than the parentstrain. It is also of interest that the xylanase activity of the mutantis much greater than of the parent strain. 17 refs, 10 figs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
