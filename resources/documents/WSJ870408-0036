American, a unit of AMR Corp., and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants began a 30-day cooling off period last month after talks broke off and both sides rejected a federal mediator's offer of binding arbitration. The cooling off period expires 12:01 EDT April 25.    After that date, American is free to impose its latest contract offer and the flight attendants are free to strike, although the union says it doesn't plan to do so. American's previous contract with its flight attendants became renewable last December.    A spokesman for the National Mediation Board in Washington said its chairman, Charles L. Woods, and staff mediator William A. Gill Jr. will begin &quot;public interest mediation&quot; on the 20th in an effort to bring the two sides to a settlement before the deadline expires. </TEXT></DOC>
