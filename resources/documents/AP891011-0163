The company, Richco Grain Ltd., has received $95 million worthof government-owned grain as subsidies under the Export EnhancementProgram since 1986.   USDA temporarily suspended the company effective Sept. 29because of its connections to Marc Rich and a Rich associate,Pincus Green. Both fled to Switzerland in 1983 before theirindictment for criminal tax evasion, racketeering, mail and wirefraud.   Kelly Shipp, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary ClaytonYeutter, said Wednesday there was ``cause for concern'' about theinvolvement as Rich and Green as company stockholders and that theagency's inspector general was continuing to investigate.   Robert Thomajan, an attorney for Richco, said the company wouldappeal the USDA action. He declined to comment on the extent ofRich's control over the company but maintained it was not anadequate reason for the suspension by USDA. He said Richco had``performed admirably'' in the export program.   The department began investigating the company earlier this yearat the request of Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., the chairman of aHouse Agriculture subcommittee that oversees the farm exportprogram.   Glickman contended Richco, a Swiss-based company, should notqualify for taxpayer-financed subsidies through EEP because Richappeared to exert control over Richco and share in its profits.   USDA, according to Glickman, determined that Rich and Green, whoalso lives in Switzerland and faces charges in the tax evasioncase, hold more than 51 percent of Richco's stock.   ``He is getting a gratuity from the United States of America inparticipating in this program,'' said Glickman. ``It's unbelievablethat the program could be operated so loosely.''   Under the program, private exporters can sell U.S. commoditiesat lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect freegovernment grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. Thecommodity bonuses are designed to go to foreign buyers to helpsweeten the deals and counter what U.S. farm groups consider unfairtrading practices by overseas competitors, particularly theEuropean Economic Community.   There have been more than $8 billion in farm sales through EEP,which was established by the 1985 farm law. At the end of July,subsidies valued at nearly $2.6 billion had been provided throughthe program.   Although pleased that USDA acted against Richco, Glickmancriticized the agency for moving too slowly.   ``Obviously this is a very embarrassing situation to thedepartment but I still don't know to this day why it took them fivemonths to do this,'' said Glickman.   According to USDA, Richco has received EEP subsidies valued at$95 million, mostly barley and wheat for sales to Saudi Arabia,Romania, China, the Soviet Union, Colombia, Poland and India.   Most recently, Richco picked up subsidies estimated at $277,000for a wheat sale in May to the Soviets. Earlier this year, Richcoranked ninth among grain exporters in amounts of EEP subsidies.   U.S. authorities have been unable to extradite Rich fromSwitzerland. The government alleges that Rich and hiscommodity-trading empire cheated the Treasury out of millions ofdollars in taxes through a series of illegal oil transactions amongRich-controlled companies. Forbes magazine has identified Rich andGreen as among the nation's wealthiest people, with each having anestimated net worth of $775 million.</TEXT></DOC>
