Police said the names were removed from police computers and other lists to prevent unfair treatment of the former suspects. Having such a record would make it difficult to get employment.    Former President Chun Doo-hwan sent tens of thousands of people to army barracks for &quot;re-education&quot; periods of four to six months in an extensive crackdown in 1980 after he seized power with military backing.    Authorities said at the time that people sent to the camps were criminals and hooligans. Dissidents contend many were antigovernment activists and innocent of any crimes. Dissidents have claimed a number of people were killed or injured in the camps.    Army Chief of Staff Lee Jong-ku told the National Assembly Wednesday that the army operated the re-education camps in 1980 to &quot;purify&quot; criminals. Opposition lawmakers called for government compensation to victims. </TEXT></DOC>
