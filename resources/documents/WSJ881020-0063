Today, Mr. Hunt and the attorneys for Minpeco S.A. are scheduled to ask U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker to sign an order dismissing the verdict against Mr. Hunt and relieving him of the burden of any portion of the $130 million award. According to Minpeco's attorneys, he will then write a check for $17 million, payable to Minpeco.    Two of the other defendants, Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt, recently declared personal bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, and they were not involved in this settlement. But Minpeco's attorneys said they would still seek at least $113 million from the defendants other than Lamar Hunt.    &quot;We consider this the first payment from the Hunts,&quot; said Mark Cymrot, an attorney for Minpeco at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Cole, Corette andamp; Abrutyn. &quot;And we intend to pursue Bunker and Herbert as well as other defendants to get the rest of the judgment.&quot;    Last August, in a sweeping verdict, a jury affirmed Minpeco's allegations that Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt, Lamar Hunt and two other defendants committed fraud and violated commodity and antitrust laws. After a six-month trial, the jury found the defendants had conspired to corner the world silver markets of 1979-80. The jury also found that the defendants, except for Lamar Hunt, had violated civil sections of the federal racketeering law.    Paul Curran, an attorney at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler, representing Mr. Hunt, declined to comment.    Two weeks after the verdict, attorneys for the three brothers requested a new trial, arguing in court papers that there was insufficient evidence to support the $130 million verdict. The attorneys' immediate concern, however, was a motion to reverse the verdict against Lamar Hunt. Defense attorneys criticized Minpeco for basing its claims against Lamar Hunt on &quot;hearsay&quot; evidence, &quot;clouded by the plaintiff's continual and deliberately vague references to the conduct of 'the Hunts.'&quot;    The order, which Judge Lasker will be asked to sign today, also stipulates that the Minpeco verdict not be used against Lamar Hunt in the two class-action suits pending against the Hunts and other defendants, according to Minpeco's attorneys. This means that, in relation to Lamar only, the conspiracy charges and all other allegations would have to be proven all over again in those actions. There are two large class-action suits on behalf of 17,000 investors against the Hunts and several brokerage firms alleging losses because of the alleged price manipulation of the 1979-80 silver market.    Minpeco's attorneys said they are not settling with Bunker and Herbert Hunt. Rather, they are &quot;aggressively pursuing them in the bankruptcy court,&quot; said Mr. Cymrot. He said his firm is filing a motion to lift a stay that protects the Hunts from post-trial motions in the Minpeco case.    In addition, Minpeco is joining Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., a creditor of the two Hunts, and the Internal Revenue Service, another creditor, in a request for an injunction blocking the transfer of any of the two Hunt brothers' assets. The request will include a spending allowance for the two brothers. </TEXT></DOC>
