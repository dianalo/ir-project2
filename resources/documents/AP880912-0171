Norm Avery said the incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m., andthat the plane was still between two runways after passengers weretaken off via escape chutes.   The plane was flight 225, which originated at Hartford, Conn.,and made a stop in Chicago before landing at Stapleton.   Witnesses who said they saw the plane land told KCNC-Channel 4that the craft came in with its nose high, and that the wheelcollapsed as the nose moved down at a landing angle.   One passenger injured an ankle while sliding down the chute,Avery said.   ``The plane carried 197 passengers and 10 crew members,'' saidSarah Dornacker, media relations manager for United at its Chicagooffices.   ``All passengers were safely evacuated after the plane left theside of the runway,'' she said.   Skies were overcast and the runways were wet, but the weatherwas not believed to be a factor in the accident, Dornacker said.</TEXT></DOC>
