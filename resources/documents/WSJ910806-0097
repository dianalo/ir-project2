The IRS filed its claim, which includes interest andpenalties, after a federal judge rejected the Securities andExchange Commission's third proposal for distributing thesettlement fund. Under the terms of that plan, the IRS wouldhave been entitled to 76% of the fund.</LP><TEXT>   Although the fund was set up to pay defrauded investors, afederal appeals court two years ago ruled that the fund alsoshould be used to pay the taxes. Judge Richard Owen said lastmonth that the latest distribution plan should be rejectedunder the appeals court ruling, because only a portion of theIRS's expected claim -- which then was estimated to be $8.5million -- would have been covered. He said the distributionplan was unfair to Mr. Levine because it left open thepossibility that he later would have to pay millions ofdollars in back taxes.   It is understood that the parties will attempt tonegotiate a settlement of the IRS claims before the SEC filesa new distribution plan. Thomas Newkirk, the chief litigatorfor the SEC, said: &quot;We're going to try to ensure thatinvestors get what's due them.&quot;   Mr. Levine, formerly employed by Drexel Burnham LambertInc., pleaded guilty in 1985 to insider trading, perjury andincome-tax evasion, touching off the government's massiveinvestigation of crime on Wall Street. In addition to turningover his alleged insider-trading profits to the SEC, Mr.Levine paid a fine of $362,000 and served 17 months inprison. The IRS claim is based on Mr. Levine's allegedillegal trading profits from 1980 to 1985.   Judge Owen also rejected the SEC proposal for distributinga $3.7 million fund paid by Robert Wilkis to settle hisinsidertrading case. Mr. Wilkis, a former investment bankerat Lazard Freres andamp; Co., pleaded guilty to four felony countsafter he was implicated in the Levine investigation.   The SEC's latest distribution proposal called for about athird of Mr. Wilkis's fund to be paid to the IRS. The IRShasn't presented a formal claim against Mr. Wilkis, however.   In rejecting the SEC's proposal for distributing the twofunds, Judge Owen said the plan &quot;represents an attempt tosettle the issue {of the IRS's claim} . . . without actuallylitigating it.&quot; Judge Owen said in his order that Mr. Levineand Mr. Wilkis &quot;are concerned that if the IRS doesn't satisfyall of its claims from these funds, it may take years toresolve their additional tax liabilities, during which timethe IRS keeps the interest clock running.&quot;   Judge Owen also said: &quot;I am sympathetic to the plight ofLevine and Wilkis; their criminal sentences are behind them;when they disgorged {the settlement funds} they undoubtedlythought that these matters would have been resolved long agoand that they could go forward with life, as should all ofthose who have `paid their debt to society,' and it isunfortunate that they are not so able.&quot;   Attorneys for Mr. Levine and Mr. Wilkis declined tocomment. A hearing in the case is scheduled before Judge Owenon Sept. 30.   ---   DETROIT CHALLENGED over plans to create all-male schools.Two mothers of school-aged daughters are challengingDetroit's plans to open schools for male students in afederal lawsuit that may set the tone for debates oversimilar proposals in other cities.   The plaintiffs, represented by lawyers from the AmericanCivil Liberties Union and the National Organization forWomen's Legal Defense Fund, filed their complaint in federalcourt in Detroit. They contend that the proposed schoolsviolate the Constitution's equal-protection clause andfederal laws forbidding gender discrimination in federallyfunded programs.   The proposed creation of high schools that would focus oneducating black males has incited one of the more heateddebates in education. Some black educators and politiciansargue that curricula at public schools ignore the peculiarneeds of black males who suffer disproportionately from drugabuse, violence and unemployment and who drop out of schoolat higher rates than other students. Others, includingsociologist Kenneth Clark and the National Association forthe Advancement of Colored People, oppose the schools as athrowback to segregation.   School boards in Baltimore, Washington, San Diego,Milwaukee, New Orleans and New York have considereddeveloping curricula for black males. But none have gone sofar as to set up schools that exclude females.   No federal court has addressed the issue. Frank Hayden,vice president of the Detroit Board of Education, saidattorneys had advised the board that the three proposed K-8grade schools would violate federal law but that the boarddecided to open the schools in September anyway.   Mr. Hayden said the board believes there is &quot;a seriousneed&quot; for the schools because the problems of non-white malestudents have reached a crisis.   ---   LAW SCHOOLS ARE FLOODED with applications. A record 94,000students have applied for admission to law schools this fall,according to the Law School Admission Services. Totalfirst-year enrollment at accredited law schools has remainedrelatively constant over the past decade, hovering between40,500 and 44,000 students. But the number of applicants hasjumped each year since 1986, intensifying competition forslots at the most prestigious schools.   &quot;Law is the last of the white-collar professions that hasstood the test of time,&quot; said Jana Cardoza, a spokeswoman forthe Admission Service, which administers the law schooladmissions test.   Wall Street's woes have tarnished the appeal of a businessdegree and high malpractice insurance rates and the specterof dealing with the AIDS epidemic have deterred students fromentering medical school, Ms. Cardoza said. In contrast,television shows such as L.A. Law &quot;glamorize the legalprofession as a fast track to success -- or at the veryleast, to power,&quot; she said.   College grads are turning to law school because they are&quot;looking for an edge in the job market,&quot; Ms. Cardoza said.&quot;Or maybe people are just looking to spend three years hidingout.&quot;   ---   NOTED: John I.
