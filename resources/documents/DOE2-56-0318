To illustrate how a circuit-basedregulatory system could be expected to operate, various laboratorieshave introduced a multitude of models; however, when these models aretested against observations regarding memory and low- and high-dose paralysis,none are completely satisfactory. This paper applies to the boolean approachto obtain a step-by-step mathematical procedure for developing an immuneresponse model. The procedure begins by listing a complete set of constraintsthat the model is required to satisfy and culminates in the developmentof a system of differential equations that is guaranteed to satisfy thoseconstraints. This procedure is used to obtain a minimal two-lymphocytemodel that simulates a set of nine immune response patterns. Then, itis illustrated how this minimal model serves as a core regulatory circuitwhich can be developed into more detailed models by adding or expandingcircuits.</TEXT></DOC>
