The owl/lark syndrome is well known. Although body chronology has been exhaustively studied in evening and night shift workers, until recently little attention has been paid to how well employees with &quot;normal&quot; workdays adapt physically to the time-of-day requirements of their jobs.    Thus far, researchers have been able to correlate body clocks with peak performance times. But it may also be true that these peak performance times coincide with work preferences: an individual works best when he or she prefers to work; and that preference is conditioned by when the employee feels best physically.    According to James L. Freeley, associate dean and professor of management at Long Island University in Greenvale, N.Y., &quot;Research has shown that matching the preferred working style of an individual to the requirements of a particular position can substantially increase productivity.&quot; Says Martin Bauman, head of the New York City executive search firm bearing his name: &quot;If the person is really good, there ought to be all sorts of leeway.&quot; However, most firms find the fact that an employee works four hours later in the evening &quot;not as significant&quot; as the fact that he or she comes in 10 minutes late in the morning, Mr. Bauman reports. Reality is conforming to the morning clock.    Michael Thorpy, M.D., director of the Sleep-Wake Disorder Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, reports that, because of an abnormality in that part of the brain that controls sleep, some individuals are &quot;extreme larks&quot; or &quot;extreme owls.&quot; While the exact cause -- and the effect of light and the seasons on human circadian rhythms -- is still not fully understood, Dr. Thorpy believes that in these individuals there is &quot;a mismatch between underlying physiology and society's clock time,&quot; which can be &quot;a very important sociological factor.&quot; The scientist suspects that the actual choice of professions or of self-employment may be an inability &quot;to stick to regular hours&quot; that's dictated by physiology.    In Lubbock, Texas, Prof. Biggers has been looking at achievement in students and student teachers. His finding: Those in both groups who are &quot;morning alert&quot; rank highest in grades. &quot;If this sort of result holds over to full-time teaching,&quot; he suggests, &quot;evaluations for merit pay (and) promotions . . . would be weighted to the morning alert teacher.&quot;    That observation has other startling implications. Talented personnel could be affected by a physical inability to learn and perform within the usual working day. That could mean that, no matter what they might contribute, they would always be unrecognized and, therefore, underused.    Since lack of synchronicity appears to be something more than an isolated phenomenon evidenced by eccentric individuals, what can businesses do to make maximum use of this &quot;handicapped&quot; talent?    While the demands of a particular industry may not allow for wide variations in 9-to-5 shifts, job-sharing or other flexible-time arrangements, there are some approaches employers and employees can take.    Among these is pre-hiring diagnosis. Stated preferences are usually a clear indication of body clocks and, therefore, of efficiency.    James Freeley and his wife, Mary Ellen Freeley, assistant professor of Education at the College of Mount St. Vincent in Riverdale, N.Y., have conducted a &quot;Productivity Environmental Preference Survey.&quot; They have found that &quot;every individual has inherent preferred working-style characteristics which can optimize productivity when matched to the needs of a task or job.&quot;    The Freeleys identified five general categories. In the physical category were distinct time-of-day preferences. If, then, working at these preferred times can increase productivity, an employer who mismatches the individual to the job or who inflexibly insists on conformity, may be defeating his or her own production goals.    Of course, schedule changes are not always practical. But where a highly trained and valued individual is mismatched, experts advise that an employer may increase efficiency by flexibility, or by scheduling important tasks to coincide with the employee's peak activity time.    Another solution: Move the individual to another job within the company, or, where possible, to another shift entirely.    This last may be less costly than it seems. Some industries, such as banking, have a 24-hour work force. &quot;Most people assume the night shift is undesirable,&quot; Mr. Freeley observes. As a result, there's a pay increment for night-shift personnel. &quot;But some people prefer to work those hours.&quot; Conversely, put a day person in an evening job and the result may be higher cost with less productivity.    What if these solutions are not possible? And what about key employees?    There are a variety of ameliorative prescriptions. Dr. Thorpy's sleep lab can help individuals who have extreme difficulty in adjusting to their body clocks, though there are limits to what's possible. He and other scientists also advise various forms of sleep hygiene, including strict adherence to regular hours, even on weekends and during vacations.    Some executives, evaluating their own peak times, adapt job demands to their internal schedules. Mr. Bauman, who characterizes himself as a &quot;late starter,&quot; has a second in command who's an early bird. Then there's the weakness-into-strength approach: One owlish real-estate executive schedules critical negotiations for mid-afternoon. By evening, when his competitors are weakening, he's at his peak.    Failing the ability -- or clout -- to make these adjustments, &quot;are there ways to fool the body?&quot; asks associate professor Stanley J. Hanna, of Gloucester County College, who is conducting a study of peak-performance-times with New Jersey bank tellers.    His answer: &quot;Raise the temperature artificially in the morning by jogging, or with a hot drink.&quot; Breakfast also helps, as does jumping into a hot shower on awakening. At the opposite end, &quot;Morning people take naps. A 15-to-20 minute nap at 2 or 3 p.m. will give them more energy.&quot;    Concludes Prof. Biggers: &quot;Morning and evening folks get by with drinking lots of coffee. But we don't get the best out of them.&quot;    ---   Ms. Trotsky lives in Staten Island and rarely begins writing before 10:30 a.m. </TEXT></DOC>
