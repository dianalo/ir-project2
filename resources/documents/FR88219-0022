Comments are requested on the proposedamendments.Prior to 1982, section 112 of the FCU Act, 12 U.S.C. 1761a, provided that,with the exception of the treasurer, no board officer of an FCU could becompensated as such. In 1982, Congress amended the Act to allow FCU's todetermine, and specify in their bylaws, which board officer (director)would be compensated. Section 701.33(a) of the NCUA Rules and Regulationscurrently provides that the treasurer is the only FCU official who maybe compensated. The NCUA Board is proposing that andSection; 701.33(a) beamended to conform to section 112 of the FCU Act, and that this sectionbe redesignated as andSection; 701.33(b)(1).Section 111(c) of the FCU Act, 12 U.S.C. 1761(c), and andSection; 701.33(a) and (b) of the NCUA Rules and Regulations currently state that no memberof the board of directors or of any other committee can, as such, be compensated,except that reasonable health, accident, and similar insurance protection,and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in the executionof the duties of the position, would not be considered compensation. Thequestion has repeatedly arisen whether it is permissible under section111(c) for an FCU to reimburse officials for pay or leave (e.g., annualleave, leave without pay) lost while attending a meeting of the board ofdirectors, or of the supervisory or credit committees. The NCUA Board requestscomment on whether, under certain circumstances, the reimbursement of officialsfor lost pay or leave should be permitted.Services performed by officials are prerequisite to the success of FCU's.An official's ability to serve, however, may be limited or discouragedby the attendant loss of pay or leave. To encourage voluntary service andfair treatment of officials, therefore, the Board proposes to amend andSection;701.33(b).Proposed andSection; 701.33(b)(2)(i) clarifies that where an official isrequired to use leave time to attend meetings of the board of directors,or of the supervisory or credit committees, or will not be paid by theofficials's employer while attending such meetings, reimbursement for payand leave actually lost in proper. Where the employer permits an officialto attend such meetings without the loss of pay or leave, or where theofficial is self-employed or cannot establish actual loss, reimbursementis not proper. Further, the proposed amendment would not permit reimbursementfor lost pay or leave incurred while attending credit union conferencesor similar events. (Payment or reimbursement of reasonable and proper costsof attending such events is, of course, permissible.)The Board also proposes regulatory guidance on indemnification of officialsand employees. As in the case of reimbursement for lost pay and leave,the NCUA Board believes that indemnification and the purchase of insuranceto provide for indemnification can help encourage voluntary service.An FCU has the authority pursuant to section 107(2) of the FCU Act, 12U.S.C. 1757(2) (the authority to sue and be sued), and section 107(16)(the incidental powers clause) to indemnify its officials and employees.NCUA has in the past interpreted these provisions as authorizing an FCUto provide for indemnification of its officials and employees under limitedcircumstances. However, the neither section 107 nor any other provisionof law or regulation provides specific guidance on the circumstances underwhich indemnification may be allowed. Proposed andSection; 701.33(c) is designedto provide that guidance.The Board believes that permitting indemnification in accordance with statecorporate law would be proper under traditional federalism principles,as set forth in Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987)),which reflects a policy of minimum Federal regulatory preemption of statelaws. The Board has further taken into account that state corporate lawis readily accessible to FCU's and their counsel, and that the abilityto follow state law guidelines should lessen the cost for FCU's choosingto implement indemnification provisions.Although a diversity of law exists regarding indemnification among thestates, NCUA's review has not uncovered anything which would be inconsistentwith the powers and responsibilities of FCU's. State law and the ModelBusiness Corporation Act would not allow indemnification for reckless,wanton, dishonest, or fraudulent conduct, or actions taken in bad faith.Only an FCU and its legal counsel can determine whether an FCU is includedwithin the parameters of a state statute, but the Board wishes to cautionthat the courts, not the Board, would be the final arbiter as to the validityof an indemnification provision under state law.The proposal would give FCU's the additional option of using the standardsset forth in the Model Business Corporation Act, both because the Act providesan extremely clear and compelling set of standards and because many statestatutes, at least on their face, do not apply directly to FCU's. An alternativewould be for NCUA to establish its own regulatory standards. That actiondoes not appear to be either necessary or advisable, in view of the flexibilityafforded by the Model Act and the various state laws. For convenience ofcommenters, the relevant portions of the Model Business Corporation Actare set forth as an Appendix to this proposal. (The Appendix is not intendedas a part of the proposal.)FCU's would be able to elect to have no indemnification or to follow <T3>either </T3>the Model Act <T3>or </T3>the relevant state law. The election must be contained in anFCU charter or bylaw amendment, or in a contract or board resolution. Failureto make an election will be considered a determination by the FCU not toprovide indemnification.The proposal would specifically exclude indemnification of officials andemployees for expenses, penalties or other payments incurred in an administrativeproceeding brought by the National Credit Union Administration unless theofficial substantially prevails on the merits. To allow indemnificationunder such circumstances would lessen the deterrent effect of administrativeactions.Section 701.33(c)(2) would make clear that, while an FCU may choose tofollow the indemnification provisions of either state law or the ModelBusiness Corporation Act, NCUA's procedural requirements regarding charteror bylaw amendments would still apply. Thus, a particular state statuteproviding for indemnification <T3>only </T3>through a charter amendment voted by the members would beinconsistent with NCUA procedures, which provides only for a vote of membersto <T3>recommend </T3>a charter amendment to the NCUA Board for approval.This should not be an impediment to indemnification since the proposalwould allow FCU's to follow the provisions of the Model Business CorporationAct, and FCU's choosing to follow state law in states which do not requirespecific procedures may choose to provide indemnification by means of anemployment contract or board resolution, neither of which require NCUAapproval.Section 701.33(c)(3) clarifies that FCU's are free to purchase insurance,such as directors and officers liability insurance, that protects officialsand employees against liability asserted against them and arising out ofthe performance of their official duties. Credit unions customarily havepurchased this insurance as a method of providing indemnification.Finally, the proposal would add a new andSection; 701.33(a), defining theterm ``official'' for purposes of andSection; 701.33 as a current or formermember of the board of directors, credit committee or supervisory committee.The definition would clarify which individuals an FCU may indemnify. Theinclusion of former FCU officials would allow an FCU to continue indemnificationof an individual who is no longer an official but is sued for activitiesrelating to official FCU duties performed as an official. Similarly, theproposal would permit indemnification of former employees.Consistent with its statutory and regulatory responsibilities, NCUA monitorindemnification provisions both for consistency with the indemnificationstandards chosen and for the safety and soundness implications for theinstitution. Also it is emphasized that the power of an FCU's board toprovide for indemnification implies the responsibility to determine whether,under the particular circumstances, indemnification is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility Act The NCUA Board has determined and certifies that the proposed amendmentswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall credit unions because the changes are directed at clarification andreduction of regulatory confusion and interpretive burdens, rather thancreation of new regulatory restrictions. Therefore, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed amendments do not contain any collection of information requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701</ITAG>Credit unions, Compensation of officials, Idemnification.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on February 10,1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, NCUA Board. </ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA proposes to amend 12 CFR Part 701 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS </ITAG>1.

It is proposed that andSection; 701.33 be revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 701.33 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Compensation of officials; indemnification of officials and employees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Official. </T3>An ``official'' is a person who is or was a member ofthe board of directors, credit committee or supervisory committee. (b) <T3>Compensation. </T3>(1) Only one board officer may be compensated asan officer of the board. The bylaws must specify the officer to be compensated,as well as the specific duties of each of the board officers. No otherofficial may receive compensation for performing the duties or responsibilitiesof the board or committee position to which the person has been electedor appointed. (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``compensation'' specificallyexcludes: (i) Payment (by reimbursement to an official or direct credit union payment)for reasonable and proper costs, including pay or leave actually lost dueto attendance at meetings of the board of directors, or of the supervisoryor credit committee, incurred by an official in carrying out the responsibilitiesof the position to which that person has been elected or appointed; (ii) Provision of reasonable health, accident and related types of personalinsurance protection, supplied for officials at the expense of the creditunion: <T3>Provided, </T3>That such insurance protection must exclude life insurance;must be limited to areas of risk, including accidental death and dismemberment,to which the official is exposed by reason of carrying out the duties orresponsibilities of the official's credit union position; must cease immediatelyupon the insured person's leaving office, without providing residual benefitsother than from pending claims, if any; and (iii) Indemnification and related insurance consistent with paragraph (c)of this Section. (c) <T3>Indemnification. </T3>(1) A Federal credit union may indemnify itsofficials and current and former employees for expenses reasonably incurredin connection with judicial or administrative proceedings to which theyare or may become parties by reason of the performance of their officialduties. (2) Indemnification shall be consistent either with the general standardsof corporate law in the state in which the principal or home office ofthe credit union is located, or with the relevant provisions of the ModelBusiness Corporation Act, but may in no event permit indemnification forexpenses, penalties, or other payments incurred in an administrative proceedingbrought by the National Credit Union Administration, unless the officialor employee substantially prevails on the merits. A Federal credit unionthat elects to provide indemnification shall specify whether it will followthe Model Business Corporation Act or the relevant state law. Failure toelect to provide indemnification will be considered a decision not to provideit. Indemnification and the method of indemnification may be provided forby charter or bylaw amendment, contract or board resolution, consistentwith procedural requirements of applicable state law or the Model BusinessCorporation Act. A charter or bylaw amendment must be approved by the NationalCredit Union Administration. (3) A Federal credit union may purchase and maintain insurance on behalfof its officials and employees against any liability asserted against themand expenses incurred by them in their official capacities and arisingout of the performance of their official duties to the extent such insuranceis permitted by applicable state law or the Model Business CorporationAct.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_The following Appendix will not appear in the Code of FederalRegulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix_Model Business Corporation Act, Subchapter E Indemnification</ITAG>Section8.50 Subchapter definitions.In this subchapter:(1) ``Corporation'' includes any domestic or foreign predecessor entityof a corporation in a merger or other transaction in which the predecessor'sexistence ceased upon consummation of the transaction.
