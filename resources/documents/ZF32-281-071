(contracts).andO;Topic:     OEMsTutorialContracts.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>David Solomont, president of Business andamp; Professional software, signed hisfirst OEM deal with Apple Computer in 1980.andP;  Since then, Solomont's $2million company has provided graphics and presentation products to a longlist of hardware and peripherals companies, including IBM, Xerox, DEC, ATandamp;T,Wang, Pansophic, Genigraphics, Polaroid, and 3M.andM;After literally dozens of successful (and occasionally unsuccessful) OEMnegotiations, Solomont says he's learned that some of the most trivialissues--payment arrangements, acceptance procedures, copyright and trademarkownership--can often make or break a deal that both sides sincerely want toconsummate.andP;  &quot;The software itself,&quot; says Solomont, &quot;turns out to be a verysmall part of most OEM relationships.&quot;andM;Solomont recently offered a few tips on how to negotiate OEM deals withandM;large corporate customers:andM;Put everything in writing.andP;  &quot;over the life of the contract, the people youstarted talking to will probably move on to other jobs.andP;  Their replacementswon't understand the fine points of the deal if the contract isn't absolutelyclear.&quot; To make sure his OEM contracts cover essential issues, solomontusually insists on supplying a first draft.andP;  &quot;I'm not shy about insisting onthis.andP;  I tell them it's going to cost me another $10,000 off the front if mylawyer has to read their contract.&quot;andM;Break the project into development phases.andP;  Except when he sellsoff-the-shelf BPS products, Solomont generally sets up deals that have&quot;escape hatches&quot; at key development landmarks.andP;  &quot;If the relationship isn'tworking, either party can get out and know exactly what the implicationsare,&quot; he says.andP;  Often, the first phase occurs even before a formal contractexists, with the preparation of a highly detailed set of productspecifications (which the OEM customer usually pays BPS to write).andP;  For verycomplicated projects, Solomont says it's often better to plan a two-phasedrelease schedule: One version is designed to generate immediate sales, whilethe second release incorporates more enhanced features.andP;  &quot;when there's moneyflowing from the market, everybody's a lot happier.&quot;andM;Decide who owns the customer and the brand.andP;  &quot;The biggest mistake I made withApple was not getting my name on the product,' Solomont says.andP;  He now triesto get equal billing for the BPS name, and he usually gets to controlwarranty card and customer support lists.andP;  &quot;We definitely want the right tokeep marketing to these customers.&quot;andM;Stay on the leading edge of technology.andP;  Many of BPS's customers pay anongoing maintenance fee of $25-$50,000/year that Solomont uses &quot;as a pool ofmoney for making improvements that benefit everybody.&quot; solomont routinelyships new drivers and other enhancements to OEM customers who contribute toBPS's Randamp;D fund; customers who don't contribute buy new technology on an a lacarte basis.andM;Take charge of pre-launch manufacturing.andP;  Solomont says that softwaremanufacturing doesn't make much money for BPS.andP;  But he's discovered that BPSusually gets new titles into production a lot faster than most corporatebureaucracies can.andP;  &quot;Our Apple II product was held up for six months becausethe color on the Apple logo was a little off,&quot; he says.andM;Become a problem solver.andP;  Unlike retail-oriented software companies, saysSolomont, &quot;we don't invest a lot of effort thinking up new dealer programs.andO;Instead, we spend our time thinking about how Polaroid can make a better filmrecorder or how 3M can expand its media business.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
