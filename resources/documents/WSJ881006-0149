White andamp; Case's partnership agreement apparently contained no provision for dumping an unwanted partner except by having the other partners vote to dissolve the firm and then re-establish it, minus one member.    Although White andamp; Case's dissolution and regrouping were accomplished in a single day in June, the steps leading up to the change -- including unsuccessful negotiations with Mr. Dawson for a voluntary departure -- lasted close to a year. Because Mr. Dawson has filed a civil lawsuit against his former firm, a final resolution could be a year or more away unless the parties can reach a settlement.    So it goes with a lot of divorcing partnerships these days, as law firms increasingly find themselves in disputes and litigation with former members over the terms of partnership agreements. Complicating matters for many firms -- primarily small ones -- is the absence of written agreements covering such basics as the division of assets.    &quot;You'd be surprised at the number of American law firms that operate without partnership agreements or {use} agreements that are out of date,&quot; says Ward Bower of Altman andamp; Weil, a consulting firm that specializes in law-firm management. Lawyers, he adds, &quot;will sign agreements they'd never let their clients sign.&quot;    Law firms and accounting firms are among the last groups of professionals to do business as general partnerships, in which the partners share in profits and management and bear personal liability for the partnership's losses. Most of the Big Eight accounting firms developed detailed partnership agreements as they grew, but most law firms have functioned happily for years without agreements or with barely adequate ones.    Now, the mobility in the law profession is underscoring the necessity of written agreements. The mergers of law firms and a growing competition for business have led to lawyers leaving firms in record numbers, voluntarily and involuntarily. That movement, in turn, has spawned a host of breakup issues. In recent cases, for instance, lawyers have sued their former partners over the legality of non-complete clauses in partnership agreements; over pension benefits, and over contingency fees collected by the firm after the partner's departure. The last example is at issue, for example, in a suit brought by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo against his former law partners.    &quot;In the last two or three years in the law business, merger mania generated a lot of the grass-is-greener mentality,&quot; says Bruce S. Sperling, a Chicago lawyer who has counseled other lawyers through about 10 breakups. &quot;Here in Chicago in the last four or five years, it's been a debacle.&quot;    If lawyers won't let clients enter into partnerships without adequate agreements, why won't the lawyers heed their own advice?    Egos get in the way, says Mr. Sperling. There's also an outdated devotion to the idea of a law fraternity. That's why, he says, most law firms remain general partnerships, in which each partner has an equal say and no one with real authority is steering the boat. When the boat starts to break up, &quot;what you then have is a free-for-all,&quot; he says. &quot;You have 200 egos running around.&quot;    Most of those fights don't reach the courtroom. Of the 10 breakups Mr. Sperling has mediated, only two went into litigation. Law-firm consultant Bradford Hildebrandt says his firm is called in to mediate 30 to 40 partnership disputes each year. Without mediation &quot;most law firms let their emotions run away&quot; and end up in court, he says. &quot;It's very expensive and very unnecessary.&quot;    It is also messy. Four weeks after White andamp; Case partners voted to oust Mr. Dawson, he filed a lawsuit in state court in Manhattan. Two judges sided with Mr. Dawson, allowing him to stay in his office at White andamp; Case for another two months. He moved into a new office Oct. 3, but his lawsuit will proceed with a public dissection of White andamp; Case's management practices.    Leslie Corwin, Mr. Dawson's lawyer, says he currently is representing five clients in law-firm breakups, and he sees a lesson in the airing of lawyers' dirty laundry. &quot;I think the message is for law firms and any partnership to have an agreement these days,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
