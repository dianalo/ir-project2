Eigler andErhard K. Schweizer say the technology has no immediateapplications, but that it may be applied to the creation ofcustom-designed molecules to be used in atom-sized transistors.andO;The team's first experiment was to spell out 'IBM' with atoms on aflat nickel crystal.andP;  The sample was chilled with liquid helium to452 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.andP;  A beam of xenon atoms wassprayed at the chilled crystal, leaving a random pattern of atoms.andO;The scientists made xenon chains similar to molecules and the'IBM' pattern by dragging the atoms into position using themicroscope.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   International Business Machines Corp.
