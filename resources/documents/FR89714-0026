Background</ITAG>In estabishing a standard of full and open competition, CICA recognizedthe use of a general announcement of an agency's research interest in conjunctionwith a peer or scientific review of proposals as a competitive procedurefor the aquisition of research (41 U.S.C. 259(b)(2)). The Federal AcquisitionRegulation (FAR) originally implemented this portion of CICA in FAR 6.102(d)(2).However, specific procedures were not detailed in CICA or in the FAR. DOE,in following the requirements of CICA and the FAR, developed a broad agencyannouncement and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 15, 1985, and annually thereafter. Thatannouncement, proposals resulting therefrom, and subsequent awards haveproduced a historical base of experience which indicates that the processis workable. Further, a final rule was published it in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 20, 1988 (53 FR 27460) which establishes,in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at FAR 35.016, general procedures(in addition to those previously set forth in FAR 6.102(d)(2)) for theuse of broad agency announcements. The DOE proposes to amend the DEAR tosupplement the FAR and implement DOE's policies, procedures, and requirementsfor the use of Research Opportunity Announcements (ROAs) as the specificform of broad agency announcements to be used by DOE. DOE has concluded that specific regulatory coverage of the broad agencyannouncement mechanism is needed to allow for procedural distinctions betweenthis type of competitive procedure and those other forms of competitivesolicitations (such as Program Research Development Announcements (PRDAs)and Program Opportunity Notices (PONs)) through which DOE can contractfor its research needs.The amendments being proposed today would add a new section 935.016, ResearchOpportunity Announcements. The proposed section sets forth the requirementsfor the synopsis and content of announcements, proposal preparation instructions,proposal evaluation criteria and procedures, and the selection and awardof contracts for basic and applied research using the broad agency announcementsolicitation mechanism.The ROA solicitation process has several procedural characteristics whichdiffer significantly from more customary solicitation approaches. Firstly,after approval to use the ROA and its subsequent synopsis and issuance,the evaluation process is controlled primarily by the cognizant DOE programoffice as opposed to a cognizant contracting activity. This was deemednecessary (1) to allow for the timely evaluation and selection of proposals;and (2) to not overburden the local contracting activities by having tocommit resources to unpredictable evaluation/selection cycles resultingfrom potentially sporadic proposal submissions. However, contracting personnelremain involved in the pre-solicitation phase and in the establishmentof administrative controls. This involvement, when taken in conjunctionwith applicable acquisition regulations and other controlling guidance,establishes the needed checks and balances in the procedure to providefor the objective and fair treatment of proposals.Secondly, DOE's implementation of the ROA procedure contains two significantlimitations. Contrary to the authorization in FAR 35.016(a) to use thebroad agency announcement to acquire not only basic and applied research,but also that part of development not related to the development of a specificsystem or hardware, DOE will use its ROA to acquire only basic and appliedresearch. This limitation is considered prudent because DOE currently hasat its disposal other viable means by which to support, fund, and acquiredevelopment related to its mission. In addition, the ROA shall not be usedto solicit proposals from, or award contracts to, the specific entitieswhich operate Government-owned or -controlled establishments, such as DOE'smanagement and operating contractors, Federally Funded Research and DevelopmentCenters (FFRDCs) chartered by other agencies, or similar establishments.An innovative feature of the ROA solicitation is its publication in the<T4>Federal Register, </T4>rather than its publication as a discrete solicitationdocument. This feature is anticipated to produce both manpower and dollarsavings by eliminating (1) the need to maintain mailing lists, (2) thepublication of large numbers of individual solicitations, and (3) expensivemailing costs, yet all the while maintaining adequate public availabilityand exposure of the solicitation.The ROA provides a solicitation vehicle through which DOE can encourageand stimulate the submission of proposals to conduct basic and appliedresearch in support of its mission- and program-level objectives and goals.In this regard, DOE will define its broad mission and program needs interms of potential areas of research and potential problem areas in relationto those specific objectives, and will solicit diverse and dissimilar solutionsto those needs from a broad universe of potential offerors. It is expectedthat offerors will bring their own unique and specialized qualificationsand capabilities to bear on concepts and ideas which advance scientificand technological research related directly to DOE's mission- and program-levelobjectives.Although this approach may appear duplicative of the objectives of othersolicitation mechanisms available to DOE to support its research initiatives,several key distinctions exist. The most significant of these distinctionsis the ROA's use of scientific and/or peer reviewers for the evaluationof proposals. ROAs also do not have the common cutoff dates (other thanthe solicitation open period) found in more traditional solicitation processes.Further, ROAs do not require the establishment of a competitive range,or the submission of best and final offers. The ROA provides DOE with astructured, streamlined, and flexible approach to solicit research proposalsin support of its mission and program needs.As a result of the implementation of the ROA as a solicitation mechanismwithin DOE, an amendment to DEAR Subpart 917.73 is needed to clarify theuse of PRDAs as a solicitation form. The current DEAR coverage prescribesthe use of PRDAs under certain circumstances (see DEAR 917.7301). Thesecircumstances when read in light of the proposed objectives and uses ofthe ROA may be interpreted similarly, thereby causing conflict in the determinationas to which solicitation mechanism may be more appropriate under apparentlylike situations. In order to distinguish the two solicitation forms, DEAR917.7301 is being amended to change the scope of the PRDA for use in acquiringresearch and development in support of a specific project area within anenergy program, while the ROA will be used to acquire research in supportof broad mission- and program-level objectives.In preparing the proposed rule, DOE considered whether there was a continuedneed for the Notice of Program Interest (NOPI), as authorized by DEAR Subpart915.5. The NOPI is a method by which DOE disseminates information on broadtechnical problem areas relevant to its mission for the purpose of stimulatingthe submission of unsolicited proposals. The NOPI is not considered a competitivesolicitation and any unsolicited proposals selected for support must bejustified in accordance with FAR Part 6 and DEAR Part 906. It was determinedthat the NOPI still serves a useful purpose within DOE. The NOPI providesDOE program offices with a mechanism by which to encourage the submission,and ultimate support, of certain research initiatives, when the ROA methodis considered to be inefficient and ineffective because the total dollarstargeted for contractually supported research are limited, the administrativeburden associated with establishing an ROA is not warranted, or the scopeof the program research agenda is more focused.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. Review Under Executive Order 12291This Executive order, entitled ``Federal Regulation,'' requires that certainregulations be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) priorto their promulgation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has decidedthat agency implementations of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984,Pub. L. 98-369, warrant review. Accordingly, this rule was submitted toOMB for review in accordance with Executive Order 12291 and OMB Bulletin85-7. OMB has completed its review and approved publication.B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility ActThis proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of1980, Pub. L. 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibilityanalysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has beenprepared. C. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction ActNo new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposedby this proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is requiredunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.). </T3>D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy ActDOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<T3>et seq. </T3>(1976)), or the Council on Environmental Quality regulations(40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), and the DOE Guidelines (40 CFR Part 1021), and,therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or an environmentalassessment pursuant to NEPA. E. Review Under Executive Order 12612Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations, rules, legislation, andany other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effectson States, on the relationship between the national government and theStates, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial directeffects, then the Executive order requires preparation of a federalismassessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementinga policy action. Today's proposed rule, when finalized, will implement and supplement certainpolicy and procedural requirements established in the Competition in ContractingAct and in the Federal Acquisition Regulations relating to the use of broadagency announcements. States which contract with DOE will be subject tothis rule. However, DOE has determined that this rule will not have a substantialdirect effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions ofthe States. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to participate by submitting data, views,or arguments with respect to the proposed DEAR amendments set forth inthis notice. Three copies of written comments should be submitted to theaddress indicated in the ``ADDRESS'' section of this notice. All writtencomments received by September 12, 1989, will be carefully assessed andfully considered prior to publication of the proposed amendment as a finalrule. DOE has considered that this proposed rule does not involve a substantialissue of fact or law and that the proposed rule should not have a substantialimpact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, and theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not planto hold a public hearing on this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>48 CFR Part 917 Special contracting methods. 48 CFR Part 935Research and development.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Parts 917 and 935 of Title 48of the Code of Federal Regulations are proposed to be amended as set forthbelow. <ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.
