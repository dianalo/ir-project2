 It was with this in mind that, in 1977, theInternational Standards Organization (ISO) set up a committee to study theissues of compatibility for network equipment.andP;  This resulted in thepublication of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.andP;  Inthis case, Open Systems refers to the fact that the model is open andavailable to any competing manufacturer's equipment.andM;The OSI model divides networking issues into functions or layers, numberedone to seven.andP;  The higher the layer, the higher the number and the higher thelevel of sophistication it provides.andP;  So level one is very basic and itsworkings would never be seen (or directly understood) by end-users; levelseven, in contrast, provides the application that end-users would usedirectly.andM;Part of the beauty of the design is that each level only communicates withthose directly above and below it.andP;  Unfortunately, in the real world manyproducts combine several layers, or even miss out layers - but theflexibility of the design allows it to continue to work.andM;The OSI layersandM;The Open Systems Interconnection model is based on seven layers: Physical,Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application(numbered one to seven respectively).andP;  To sum the model up in a sentence:layer one, the Physical layer, is the hardware (wires and plugs) that carriesthe signals about the network, and layers two through to seven (implementedin software) decide what to send down the wires - layer seven being theapplication that end-users are working with.andM;The importance of sticking to the OSI layers becomes paramount when networkscontaining different makes and types of machine are used, since unless thesame basic model is adhered to by all parties, very little will happen whenyou throw the power switch.andM;Layer 1 - PhysicalandM;This is the layer most easily visible in its implementation; it coverscabling (such as twisted-pair, coaxial or fibre-optic) and exactly how andwhat is sent down the cables -in the case of twisted-pair it would covervoltage polarity and voltage size for logical ones and zeros.andP;  In the case ofa fibre-optic system it would cover the light pulse's frequency, pulse shape,intensity and so on.andP;  All the higher levels in the model communicate via thePhysical layer.andM;Layer 2 - Data-LinkandM;This layer ensures that data travelling around the network is in a formatthat's meaningful and error free.andP;  It's concerned with how data is encodedand decoded as it's passed around the system by the Physical layers.andP;  Eachexchange between Data-Link layers is contained in something called a frame,which would typically contain the destination and source addresses, the dataitself, error control bits and 'received correctly' flags.andP;  This layerinterprets and generates not only these frames but also, with the soleexception of the data which is to be sent, its contents.andM;Some of the best known protocols in this layer are the bisynchronous, HDLC(High-level data link control), and ADCCP (Advanced data communications andcontrol procedures) protocols.andM;The Data-Link and Physical layers are usually known as the hardware layers(for obvious reasons) and form a base for the following five -which aresoftware based.andM;Layer 3 - NetworkandM;In many local area networks this third layer - the Network layer - isn'tneeded.andP;  Its function is a routing one - deciding which route data shouldtake to reach a particular destination from a certain source.andP;  This routecould vary across a network due to congestion, a link failure or priority ofa packet.andP;  An analogous model would be a motorbike courier controller incentral London, directing couriers according to customer importance andtraffic conditions.andM;In the PC world, however, many networks don't use a network layer, simplybecause the medium employed provides no options for different routes.andM;So, baseband networks, such as Ethernet, use only a single channel and haveno need for routing (rather like a ring road with no junctions off it).andP;  ANetwork layer is required in cases where LANs are bridged with gateways, inbroadband network systems or in wide area networks (WANs), all of which cansupport more than one route across a network from one source to anotherdestination.andM;Layer three is implemented in software but not in the PC or source computer.andO;Instead, it's in smart switches which are part of the network structure,acting on the destination address within the frames passing throughandM;The unit of information used by the Network layer is a Packet - hence thename 'packet switching systems' which is familiar to Telecom Gold users, andthe packets used as a basis for X.25.andP;  The network interface cards in the PCor workstation have the responsibility of producing addresses that can beacted upon correctly, though.andM;Layer 4 - TransportandM;The Transport layer can be thought of as doing a job similar to the previouslayer, the Network layer.andP;  Indeed, if layers two and three are doing theirjobs to the full, there'll be little left for the Transport layer to do.andP;  Itsjob is really to provide an assurance to the higher levels about thereliability of the data they're sending.andP;  Therefore, it looks after errorhandling, flow control and the assignment of an alternate route if there's aconnection breakage.andM;Importantly, the Transport layer also looks after the correct formatting andordering of packets.andP;  If one large chunk of data requires several packets,it's quite likely that they'll take different routes through the network,arriving out of order - it's up to the Transport layer to interpret the orderinformation in the packet and re-order them correctly.andM;There are many protocols floating about that define the Transport layer in astricter manner, including TCP/IP (Transmission Control Program/InternetProgram), ATP (AppleTalk Transaction Protocol) and NetWare's SPX (SequencedPacket Exchange).andM;These last four layers - Physical, Data-Link, Network and Transport - areoften grouped together and referred to as the transport services.andP;  This groupensures that the orders from the bosses in the higher layers are carried outcorrectly.andM;Layer 5 - SessionandM;This is one of the most important layers in a local area network: when twodevices decide to communicate (which is, after all, the prime purpose of aLAN) they're said to establish a session.andP;  The Session layer manages themaking and breaking of sessions between two or more devices or applicationsin a network.andM;Typical Session layers are implemented in software and include NetBIOS, APPC(Advanced Program to Program Communications) and ASP (AppleTalk SessionProtocol).andM;Layer 6 - PresentationandM;When using an application across a network, the menus, colours, graphicssymbols and character sets are represented as control sequences.andP;  It's theresponsibility of the Presentation layer to ensure that these are correctlydecoded in order to produce a similar result on screen to that originallydesigned by the programmer.andM;The Presentation layer also handles data encryption and decryption (if used)and the controlling software for printers and plotters.andP;  In a PC-basedsystem, the Presentation layer is most obvious in terminal emulators thatexpand the screen controlling codes and sort out the correct character setsto use.andM;Layer 7 - ApplicationandM;Believe it or not, this is where the application to be used sits.andP;  It's thelayer most obvious to and directly controlled by end-users.andP;  From theapplication end-users are, usually unknowingly, setting up and directing thelower six layers.andP;  The Application layer can contain any application, fromemail to a database program.andM;ConformingandM;The OSI model has taken a long time to get here, and the goalposts of thehigher levels are still being moved (layers 1 to 4 are fiexed).andP;  This hascaused some reluctance to implement OSI systems on the part of developers,but this looks set to change - and rapidly.andP;  This is a result of a statementissued several months ago by the EC, in which it requested governmentpurchasing groups to ensure that vendors supplying contracts worth more than100,000 ECU (European Currency Units) complied with the OSI specifications.andO;The profile that suppliers to the UK must conform to has been defined asGOSIP (Government OSI Profile) defined by the CCTA (Central Computer andTelecommunications Agency).andM;This has led to a spate of OSI-compatible flag waving sessions by the largernetwork suppliers, 3Com and Novell, both of whom have recently releaseddetails and timetables for proposed OSI and X.400 (email) support.andM;ImplementationsandM;Almost all current networking products, hardware and software, can be placedinto one (or, in some cases, more than one) layer.andP;  For instance, LANManager, X.400 and SQL all sit in the Presentation layer of the OSI model.andO;NetBIOS, though, stretches itself over three layers: Session, Transport andNetwork.andM;In, say, an AppleTalk system, all the boundaries are strictly adhered to,each section ending on a boundary.andP;  In Novell's NetWare or Microsoft's LANManager products the boundaries become woolly, especially between thePhysical and Data-Link layers.andP;  But this is due to the IEEE 802 sub-layers inthe Data-Link layer (see Other standards box) used by NetWare and LANManager, while AppleTalk uses its own LLAP, ELAP or TLAP protocols for theLocalTalk, EtherTalk and Token Ring packages respectively.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
