It is quite ironic that of all the West European countries, West Germany has the toughest laws regarding desecration of the flag.    I couldn't help thinking that some burning of the Nazi flag would have been appropriate during the dark days of Hitler. Of course, most Germans would have been incensed by such an act; after all, Hitler came to power in a democracy.    Unfortunately, the Germans did not have a firmly established Constitution with a Bill of Rights. Protesters in general, and the Jewish people in particular, had no lawful protection. It is with a strong Constitution and Bill of Rights that liberty is guaranteed and dissent protected.    Americans have lost sight of the fact that liberty and democracy are not one and the same. With no Bill of Rights, the majority could vote to deprive the minority of whatever liberties it decided were no longer needed.    Our Founding Fathers understood this danger. Now we have our president proposing that the Constitution be amended to provide for laws to prohibit desecration of the flag. A separate amendment regarding desecration of the flag merely would pit one amendment against another. For one person's freedom of speech (i.e. flag burning) may be another's desecration.    I suppose that if George Bush had been around during the time of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison he would have written the First Amendment a bit differently. After all, isn't Mr. Bush really proposing that the Bill of Rights be amended?    As far as I'm concerned, America is strong enough to withstand flag burning. Just don't burn our Constitution and Bill of Rights]    Christopher W. Carpenter    Seminole, Fla. </TEXT></DOC>
