Timothy Lucas, research director of the chief rule-makingbody for accountants, said that the new deferred-tax proposal&quot;is considerably reduced in complexity.&quot; He also said thedeferred-tax proposal would ease the impact on profits of anew rule on post-retirement medical benefits by more than30%. The medical benefits rule was expected to pare totalcorporate profits by as much as $1 trillion starting in 1993.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This new FASB deferred-tax proposal goes a long waytoward reducing the ambiguities and unanswered questions ofthe previous rule,&quot; said Gaylen Larson, group vice presidentof Household International Inc. in Chicago.   Janet Pegg, a vice president and accounting analyst forBear, Stearns andamp; Co., noted that under the former rule,corporations wouldn't be permitted to offset medical-benefitcosts and accruals with future tax credits. The new proposalpermits such offsets if taxable profits are expected infuture years. &quot;This wipes away a major complaint ofbusiness,&quot; Ms. Pegg said.   The proposal drops a costly and complex requirement thatcertain tax credits must be scheduled out for up to 60 yearseach year on the balance sheet. Some big companies had saidthat this scheduling could cost thousands of dollars toimplement in new computer systems and personnel.   Since 1982, when the deferred taxes were first considered,the FASB has received more than 1,500 letters fromcorporations complaining about certain aspects of FASBproposals on the issue, Mr. Lucas noted. He said thatproposal delays implementation of the deferred-tax rule forthe third time, to calendar 1993, for annual financialstatements.   The proposal, like the previous rule, doesn't requirecompanies to accrue or set up a reserve for foreign earningsthat aren't repatriated to the U.S. There was considerabledebate among FASB members about this requirement but itwasn't initiated, Mr. Lucas said. Large multinationalcompanies have long opposed this accrual because it wouldsharply cut reported profits.   Mr. Lucas said public hearings will be held on theproposal in September or October with a new final ruleexpected in 1992's first quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
