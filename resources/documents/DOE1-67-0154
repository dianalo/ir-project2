The formulae for secularvariation of the eccentricity, semimajor axis and pericentre positionare derived. For two values of the ratio of the gravitational wave frequency{omega} to that of the orbital motion {omega}/sub 0/, {omega}/{omega}/sub0/=1, 3, the secular terms in the pericentre shifts depend on the eccentricitye as e/sup -1/, resulting in a possibility of increasing the effect ase decreases.</TEXT></DOC>
