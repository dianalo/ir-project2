The deconvolution method utilizes the well-knownfact that P-wave spectra can be decomposed into source and receiver spectralfactors. The source functions obtained in the deconvolution process providea better picture of the nature of explosion source-time functions, andin particular of the presence or lack of secondary arrivals followingthe P wave such as pP or spall. The presence of such secondary arrivalsand their effects on the first cycle of the P wave are very importantin yield estimation. Significant variations in the deconvolved sourcetime function between test sites may be associated with topography andtesting practices. All of the source functions show complexity in additionto the initial P arrival and pP arrival, if present. There is also agreat deal of variation between different source time functions for eventsat the same test site. Often, but by no means always, events occurringnear each other look particularly similar. The site functions are alsocomplex in most cases, and azimuthal variations are significant in bothsource and receiver regions. Site and source effects contribute aboutequally to the energy observed in the P codes of the events analyzed.Deconvolved source time functions should be especially useful for improvingestimates in the m/sub b/ bias between test sites and to improve yieldestimates since site as well at t*, instrument, and any known sourcespectra are removed.</TEXT></DOC>
