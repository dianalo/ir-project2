Secondary markets finished only slightly higher after having risen about half a point earlier. Dealers were reluctant to stick to the earlier gains because of fluctuations in the dollar. Many traders also weren't eager to open significant exposures in advance of today's employment data from the U.S. and next week's summit meeting.    Toyota Motor Credit's $100 million issue lifted off so late in the day that by the close of London markets, many dealers still hadn't decided whether to accept invitations to join the syndication group being assembled by Nikko Securities Co. (Europe).    The three-year bonds, which bear a coupon of 8 5/8% at 101 1/8, offered a return about five basis points below a three-year issue with similar features by Ford Motor Credit Co. in late May. But Toyota's double-A/triple-A senior debt rating makes it a slightly better credit than Ford, syndication officials at other houses said. That, they said, justifies Toyota's pricing and should make the issue a test of the Eurodollar straight-debt market's health.    Elsewhere, gilt prices dived in late trading as the market, already nervous about the British government's chance of reelection, was shaken by a rumor that an opinion poll would show the Conservative lead cut to two points.    The rumor was denied by Marplan Ltd., the agency conducting a poll for publication in the Guardian newspaper today.    The World Bank issued #200 million ($326.3 million) of 9 1/4% Eurobonds due July 20, 2007, at 98 3/4 to yield 9.40%, via Baring Brothers andamp; Co. It was first long-term Eurosterling issue by the World Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
