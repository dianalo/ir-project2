WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Government leaders appear to have forgone forthe moment the uncustomary practice of lambasting the UnitedStates, an ally and investor of long standing, but they may startagain at election time.   ``Having the audacity to bash a superpower, even if it's yourlargest trading partner and strongest friend, is one way to rallyvoters,'' an Asian diplomat said.   Parliamentary elections must be held by December 1989 in thisisland republic of 2.6 million people but are expected to be calledabout a year earlier.   The People's Action Party of Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew hasbeen in power since 1959 and won its seventh election in 1984,capturing 77 of the 79 Parliament seats. It won only 63 percent ofthe popular vote, however, compared to 76 percent the time before.   No viable opposition is in sight, but Lee's party has lost theaffections of some voters, and its authoritarian style grates on anelectorate that is becoming better educated and more affluent.   Under his leadership, Singapore has been transformed from ashabby British colonial outpost to a regional banking, industrialand communications center.   Direct U.S. investment is $2.3 billion and increasing by about$200 million a year, according to U.S. statistics. The largestprivate employer is Seagate Technology, a U.S. disk-drivemanufacturer that began with 50 workers six years ago and nowemploys 13,000.   Lee, the longest-serving democratically elected leader in theworld, forged close links with Washington years ago.   He was invited to address a joint session of Congress in 1985and is among the few heads of Asian governments to be outspoken insupport of keeping U.S. military bases in the Philippines.   So why did his subordinates aim harsh words at the UnitedStates, adding it to a list of targets including otherwiseunspecified ``foreign powers,'' foreign journalists, Marxistconspirators, Australia, and international human rights and legaloganizations?   One European diplomat suggested tensions involving both thecoming election and other impending changes were responsible.   The prime minister will be 65 in September and has indicated hemay retire from office.   It has been confirmed that the constitution will be amended togive executive powers to the largely ceremonial presidency.Speculation is widespread that Lee will be the first executivepresident.   Former President C.V. Devan Nair and other critics say thegovernment used the specter of foreign menace to deflect attentionfrom a joint statement in April by nine former political detainees,who said they were falsely arrested as alleged subversives a yearago and physically abused.   Earlier this year, Washington said it will remove Singapore,Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, the fast-growing ``economicdragons'' of Asia, from the Generalized System of Preferences. Thepolicy takes effect in January.   Under the preference system, certain goods from developingcountries have duty-free access to the United States. The fourcountries no longer are regarded as developing.   The other three took it in stride, but Singapore said it wasbetrayed because Washington promised to retain the specialtreatment if it tightened laws against patent and copyright piracy,which it did.   A carefully arranged demonstration was staged at the U.S.Embassy.   Relations grew worse May 7 when Singapore expelled E. MasonHendrickson, first secretary in the U.S. Embassy's politicalsection.   Hendrickson was accused of meddling in domestic politics byencouraging several lawyers to run as independents againstgovernment party candidates in the next election.   Washington said his actions were nothing more than normaldiplomatic information-gathering. It ousted a Singaporean ofequivalent rank from the United States in response.   Singapore alleged that Hendrickson and other State Departmentofficials had dealings with Francis Seow, 59, a formersolicitor-general and president of the Law Society.   Seow has been in jail for a year under the Internal SecurityAct, which allows detention without trial, to keep him from``acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore,''in the Home Ministry's words.   Lee said charges of meddling should not be allowed to harmlong-term relations between Singapore and the United States.   He told Parliament his country was ``not condemning the criminaldesigns of an enemy, but regretting the misdemeanors of a friend.... We should not harm our long-term basic interests when weprotest against this unwarranted American interference.''   His moderate tone contrasted with shrill rhetoric from others.Goh Chok Tong, deputy prime minister, threatened to reduce thenumber of diplomats allowed at the U.S. Embassy unless Washingtonmended its ways.   Goh, 46, who is positioned to succeed Lee, said the country``can move into a more neutral and non-aligned posture.''   His remarks were made during five days of debate on a motionsupporting ``firm action of the government to prevent our countryfrom being subverted, whether by Marxists, Communists, Westernpowers or other foreign interest groups.''   A co-sponsor, Goh Choon Kang, likened the country's situation tothat of ``a girl in a bar being molested by a sex maniac.''</TEXT></DOC>
