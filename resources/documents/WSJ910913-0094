The new scheme is still rather vague, but like Motorola'sIridium project, it would depend on a network of satelliteslinking the pocket phones to each other and to conventionaltelephone networks. However, the consortium's Project 21would be more evolutionary than Motorola's ambitious plan,which requires launching 77 new low-orbit satellites in themid-1990s.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We believe there is a way that is financially less risky,technologically less risky,&quot; said Olof Lundberg, directorgeneral of the consortium, International Maritime SatelliteOrganization, or Inmarsat.   Inmarsat is a treaty organization with 64 membercountries, each represented by a company active in satellitecommunications -- often the state telecommunications company.Although based in London, its biggest owner is CommunicationsSatellite Corp., the U.S. signatory.   Mr. Lundberg was sparing with details of Project 21 (thenumeral refers to the 21st century), saying that manydecisions remain about the technology Inmarsat will use forthe system. But he said the investment required would likelyfall between $500 million and $1 billion, compared with $2.1billion that Motorola and its partners plan to spend settingup Iridium.   Mr. Lundberg said savings would come from reusingtechnology found in existing telephone systems and by usingsome existing satellites.   Inmarsat said its system would be in place by the end ofthe century, and that the target cost of small satellitephones -- which would be made and sold by outside firms --should be $1,000 apiece or less. The cost of phone calls onthe system should be less than $1 a minute.   Motorola, the electronics and semiconductor giant based inSchaumburg, Ill., said it wasn't surprised by Inmarsat'sannouncement, which it criticized as overly vague. &quot;Rightnow, I'd characterize (Project 21) strictly as a vision,&quot;said Durrell Hillis, Motorola's general manager of satellitecommunications.   Mr. Hillis argued that Project 21 validates Iridium ideas,such as portability and low-orbit satellites. CurrentInmarsat satellite phones -- which use higher-orbitgeostationary satellites -- are the size of a suitcase, andwill shrink to briefcase-sized units in a few years.   But telecommunications consultants said the potentialmarket for satellite phones may be too small to justifyeither company's approach. They also noted that action willbe required to clear enough space on the international radiospectrum to accomodate signals beamed between satellites andsmall phones -- an issue both Inmarsat and Motorolaacknowledge.   Mr. Lundberg estimated that the global market forgo-anywhere satellite phones, which would be more expensivethan other mobile phones, would be &quot;a few million&quot; users.   Early users would include Inmarsat's existing customers,he said, as well as globe-trotting chief executives andwealthy people who want to avoid the confusion of manyincompatible cellular systems. Mr. Lundberg also touted theservice's potential cost-effectiveness in areas unlikely tobe covered by cellular service anytime soon: sparselypopulated areas, such as Africa, and regions with difficultterrain.</TEXT></DOC>
