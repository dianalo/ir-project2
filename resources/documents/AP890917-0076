Gen. ProsperAvril on Sunday promised democratic reforms and economic progress ina speech marking the first anniversary of the coup that put him inpower.   In the address broadcast on the state-run media from the NationalPalace, Avril said, ``Our quest is to promote the human, economic,social, and political rights of Haitians.''   He asked the international community to back efforts to returnthis impoverished Caribbean nation to civilian rule.   On Sept. 17, 1988, rank-and-file soldiers outraged by what theycalled state-sponsored violence ousted former military ruler Lt.Gen. Henri Namphy in a bloodless coup. They chose Avril to head anew government.   The soldiers, mostly of the Presidential Guard, also demanded areturn to democratic rule and a respect for human rights.   Some Haitians are skeptical that Avril will do what he haspromised.   ``Hope has been reborn in an eventual solution to our problems,even if the relief which Haitians felt at the overthrow of Namphyhas not developed into confidence in Avril,'' said LeopoldBerlanger, director of the Haitian Research and DevelopmentInstitute.   In March, Avril partially restored the 1987 Constitution thatNamphy had suspended in July 1988. Avril has pledged to turn overpower to an elected government and allowed the creation of anindependent Electoral Council.   That council is expected to announce later this month a date forelections.   The U.S. government granted $10 million in surplus wheat to Haitiin June.   Washington resumed direct government aid suspended after abortedelections of 1987, when thugs protected by soldiers killed at least34 voters at polling stations.   Hundreds of allegedly corrupt soldiers and officers have beendischarged from the army since Avril took power.   On Dec. 14 his government signed five international human-rightsconventions. However, human rights groups charge that abuses, oftenperpetrated by soldiers, are still common.   Haiti has been govered by military-dominated governments sincedictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country during violentdemonstrations that ended about three decades of Duvalier familyrule. He now lives in exile in France.</TEXT></DOC>
