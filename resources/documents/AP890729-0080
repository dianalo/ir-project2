Under the contract, signed Friday in New York, Amoco and thestate-owned Polish Oil and Gas Co. will conduct a 12-month jointstudy of geological and geophysical data on roughly 40 percent ofthe country, the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday.   If the exploration indicates potential oil reserves, Amoco andPolish Oil and Gas would negotiate a second contract that wouldenable the Chicago-based company to drill exploratory wells andultimately produce oil.   Amoco Production Co. employees will go to Warsaw next month, andPolish Oil and Gas employees will eventually come to the U.S.production company's Houston headquarters to study the data.   Amoco, the fifth-biggest U.S.-based energy company, has beenconducting a similar study in Yugoslavia.   Poland produces only 3,000 barrels of oil a day, according toCentral Intelligence Agency estimates. By comparison, Illinoispumps 63,000 barrels a day.   Poland consumes an estimated 540,000 barrels of oil a day, muchof that obtained from the Soviet Union in exchange for machineryand other goods.   But the potential for oil is indicated by Poland's abundance ofcoal _ the two hydrocarbons are often found in proximity to oneanother.   Poland hasn't explored intensively for oil for at least 45years, and thus may have missed deposits detectable with today'ssophisticated equipment, said Alfred Munk, Amoco's manager offoreign affairs.   ``It's a problem of technical capabilities and money,'' said JanSzczurowski, the economic attache at the Polish commercialconsular's office in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
