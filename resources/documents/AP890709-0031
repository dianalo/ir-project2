(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Castro government is allowingincreasing numbers of older Cubans to visit the United States, andU.S. officials say the reason is clear _ money. The Cubans charge afee of $700 and up for the privilege.   ``In the last six months the number of Cuban citizens beingallowed to visit relatives in the U.S. has jumped dramatically,''the Sun-Sentinel quoted an unidentified U.S. official in Havana assaying.   The number of B-2 tourist visas, issued by the U.S. interestsSection in Havana, that the Cuban government has allowed to be usedjumped from 230 a month in October to 1,823 a month in March toabout 3,000 a month in June, the newspaper reported Sunday.   At the present rate, by year's end about 30,000 Cubans will haveentered or be eligible to visit the United States.   No figures are kept on the number who seek asylum, said EileenConvy, assistant Immigration and Naturalization Service districtdirector in southern Florida.   The United States approves most visa requests from Cubans,consular officials said.   However, the Cuban government restricts the use of the visas tomen over 65 and women over 60, and requires them to pay a fee of$700 to $1,000. Cuban exiles in the United States mail theirrelatives the money for the fee.   ``All you have to do is multiply 3,000 by $700 try to determinehow much the Cuban government is keeping, and you'll see it's in themillions of dollars,'' an unidentified consular official told thenewspaper. ``All those dollars are paid by the relatives in thestates.''   The U.S. Interests Section, which handles U.S. affairs in Havanabecause the nations lack full diplomatic relations, said the numberswill continue to grow if the Cuban government allows it.   ``The Cuban government is very excited about this stepped-up B-2program because it represents a lot of money for them, which theyalways need. They have even talked of lowering the age of thoseeligible to travel, from 60 to 50 years, and that would create morebusiness,'' the newspaper quoted a U.S. official as saying.   Told of the increase in tourist visas from Cuba, State Departmentspokesman Frances Jones said: ``I guess we are being caught bysurprise by this increase. Our people in Havana have not informed usyet.''   Relatives of Francisco Carbonell, 70, who had not seen him fornearly 30 years, recently brought him to Miami.   ``He wanted to come and we thought maybe this would be the lasttime we would see each other,'' said Eduardo Heria, 65, one ofCarbonell's cousins.   Six relatives contributed $720 so Carbonell could pay the fee fora 20-day visit. An additional $225 would have extended his stay to40 days.   Each visitor is allowed to return to Cuba with 100 pounds ofluggage. Only clothes and food items are allowed. Jewelry andelectrical appliances, things that can be resold, are not permitted.   Returning travelers must pay four Cuban dollars for each poundbrought back. They must also declare any U.S. dollars they have;those dollars may be spent only at a tourist store on the island.   ``I would normally not want to give money to Castro'sgovernment,'' said Heria, an exile for 25 years. ``But I wanted mycousin to taste America at least once in his life. So, I gave Castroa few dollars. It was a dilemma.''</TEXT></DOC>
