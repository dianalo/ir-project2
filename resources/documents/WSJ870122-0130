If all goes according to plan, the president's elder daughter will -- at her father's request -- become co-chairman of the GOP tomorrow. Energetic, bright and articulate, she appears a political natural. So why is her impending election causing such trepidation in party circles?    Well, for one thing, Jack Londen, the party's Western-states vice chairman, complains that &quot;she's a nice gal but she doesn't agree with the man in the White House on a number of issues.&quot; She is an outspoken supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and of comparable-worth pay for female workers, which her father's administration opposes. And while her father is strongly anti-abortion, she refuses to give her views on the issue.    Then there is the matter of her support for a liberal Democratic candidate for the Los Angeles City Council in 1985 while she was being paid as a part-time consultant to the Republican National Committee. Ms. Reagan says she was just helping an old friend, but her role incensed the man who was California's GOP chairman at the time, Mike Antonovich. &quot;Mike told her he thought it was inappropriate, but his thoughts didn't carry much weight,&quot; says his spokesman, Dawson Oppenheimer.    Finally, there is some concern that the president's daughter has a few eccentricities, none of which she seems the least bit apologetic about. For instance, the 45-year-old political dynamo has been known to carry a stuffed animal on her campaign swings. And she is quite certain that she and her husband, political consultant Dennis Revell, have seen a ghost. In their bedroom. In the White House.    &quot;I'm not kidding. We've really seen it,&quot; she says. &quot;It's a transparent person. What one sees, really, is the aura color. Dennis saw a deep pinkish aura; I saw red. Dennis saw him standing by the fireplace, and I saw him standing by the window.&quot;    It is only fitting that the soon-to-be second-highest-ranking official in the Republican Party believes that the spirit belongs to the party's first president, Abraham Lincoln. When she is in town, she says, she usually uses the Lincoln bedroom, partly because it is the only room in the house with a bed long enough for her 6-foot-7-inch husband. (Mr. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the bedroom, which at the time was his study.) The reason she thinks the spirit is Mr. Lincoln's, she says, is this:    &quot;In the bedroom, there's a portrait of Lincoln which is often askew. I don't think he likes that painting because it makes him look cruel, and Lincoln was not a cruel man.&quot;    Actually, Ms. Reagan does have some White House lore on her side. Through the years, other White House visitors -- among them Winston Churchill and Queen Juliana of the Netherlands -- are said to have spotted the Lincoln ghost, too. Still, Ms. Reagan acknowledges that &quot;when I went down and told my parents what I saw, they looked at me weirdly.&quot; She adds, &quot;I told them I wasn't kidding.&quot;    When stepmother Nancy Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, is asked whether such psychic sightings have now become familywide, she replies delicately: &quot;The Reagans are aware that Maureen thinks she saw a ghost in the room. The Reagans think there might very well be a ghost there. But if there is, they think it's friendly.&quot;    It obviously isn't a subject that others at the White House are anxious to discuss. White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, asked about the ghost story, rolls his eyes and says, &quot;I've never seen one -- and I don't look under my bed at night, either.&quot; When Thomas Dawson, a Regan aide, begins to interject, &quot;Oh sure, the president talks about it all the --,&quot; Mr. Regan, cuts him off, knits his eyebrows, puts a finger in front of his mouth and says, &quot;Shhhhh!&quot;    When Betty Heitman, the GOP official Ms. Reagan is to succeed, is told of the ghost sighting, she pauses. &quot;Maureen said that?&quot; she asks. &quot;Uh, hmm. I don't want to touch that with a 10-foot pole.&quot;    Among other Republicans, the controversy over Maureen Reagan isn't limited to her ghost stories. Some resent the way her family connections put her in position for the co-chairman's job. Ms. Reagan denies that she angled for the post and in fact says the offer came as a surprise to her, but she confirms that her father was behind the idea. After hearing about it, she jokes, &quot;I went over to the White House and said, 'Thanks a lot -- I think.'&quot;    Others question her temperament, which associates say swings between utterly charming -- her Secret Service code name is &quot;Radiant&quot; -- and childishly tempestuous. Aides recount tales of her explosions at them. A party official who has dealt with her for years explains: &quot;When she's on your side, she'll stop a locomotive for you. But when she turns on you, which she does if she has any reason to believe that you're not in complete agreement with her, she becomes the locomotive.&quot; When one GOP official learned from a reporter that Ms. Reagan was to become party co-chairman, the phone went dead for a moment, after which the official said, &quot;That silence was off the record.&quot;    Ms. Reagan herself agrees, almost cheerily, that &quot;I have a temper.&quot; She recounts once blowing her top on a 1984 campaign swing through Florida at a man making wild accusations about Vice President George Bush. &quot;I grabbed him by the arm and called him a {vulgarity deleted},&quot; she recalls. &quot;Jeb Bush {the vice president's son who was also present} was amazed.&quot;    Ms. Reagan, whose mother is the actress Jane Wyman, has been an indefatigable campaigner for her father and other GOP candidates. In 1984, she stumped through all 50 states, working especially hard to woo women voters and close the so-called gender gap. She drew rave reviews for her speaking ability, but some wondered about the fact that she sometimes carried with her a stuffed puma named &quot;Oscar.&quot; The Washington Post reported that she carried it in her tote bag and arranged it on the back of her airplane seat when flying. On one occasion, she stopped to buy it a present -- some toy sunglasses.    Her impending election has &quot;created a genuine dilemma for loyal supporters of the president,&quot; says Mr. Londen, the party official, whose main complaints are ideological. &quot;Eighty percent of the people I talk to are against her,&quot; he says, &quot;but no one wants to put a blot on her father.&quot; Party members are especially unlikely to force the issue now, when the president is troubled by the Iran-Contra affair.    Despite the complaints from such critics as Mr. Londen, other Republicans say she will be a valuable addition to the party leadership. White House political director Mitchell Daniels cites her &quot;tremendous energy and fierce loyalty to her father.&quot; And Michele Davis, the executive director of the Republican Governors Association, says, &quot;She's great at motivating people and giving the party a human dimension.&quot;    Besides, as Ms. Reagan herself points out, she has clout. &quot;If the dinner table is the ultimate forum,&quot; she says, &quot;then I've got it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
