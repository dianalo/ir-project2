The loss also drew angry chargesof mismanagement and deceit from analysts and shareholders,several of whom are suing.   But the wider impact could be on the country's $50 billionannual long-distance phone bill, and on industry regulation.US Sprint Communications Co. is one of the few challengers totake a significant share of a market dominated by giantAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. With Sprint reeling, &quot;thefundamental question is whether there is competition outthere,&quot; says David Wagenhauser, head of theTelecommunications Research and Action Center, a consumerwatchdog group.   For ATandamp;T, which is pleading with the FederalCommunications Commission to ease regulation and end thecompany's official designation as the nation's &quot;dominant&quot;carrier, the Sprint troubles are most inopportune. They comeas the long-distance market is rapidly consolidating into anoligopoly headed by ATandamp;T and second-ranked MCI, which hasagreed to buy the fourth largest carrier, Telecom USA. Thereare many tiny players, but they have been vanishing; thenumber of carriers and &quot;resellers&quot; of long-distance servicehas plunged from 500 in 1986 to about 275 today, according tothe Competitive Telecommunications Association (Comptel).   As a result, consumer watchdogs say, customers can expecthigher rates. ATandamp;T, after having seen industry pricing fallsteadily by almost 45% since its 1984 breakup, recentlyannounced its first price increase to individuals andbusinesses since the breakup. Rivals are expected to followsuit. And with the decline of competition, the watchdogs say,comes less incentive to introduce innovative services. &quot;Wefear a repeat of what happened in the airline industry,&quot; saysCatherine Sloan, Comptel's legislative director. &quot;Two orthree top carriers dominated by a price leader canautomatically drive prices up.&quot;   ATandamp;T's almost 70% of the market towers over MCICommunications Corp.'s 14% and Sprint's 10%, enabling ATandamp;T toset industry price and service standards. Yet the FCC closedoff a window on ATandamp;T's cost structure, which was an aid tocompetitors, by moving last year to regulate ATandamp;T with simpleprice caps instead of a cost-based formula. Moreover, the FCCis considering dropping ATandamp;T's &quot;dominant&quot; designation, sayingindustry competition is sufficient to warrant the change.That would mean ATandamp;T would face far less scrutiny byregulators than it does now.   As for ATandamp;T, &quot;Our contention is that this is anextraordinarily competitive market,&quot; says Victor A. Pelson,group executive of communications services.   The Sprint debacle provides a rallying point for theopposition to a freer hand for ATandamp;T. The FCC's &quot;price caps{have} failed to protect consumers adequately,&quot; says theConsumer Federation of America. Comptel's Ms. Sloan, whosegroup represents small industry players, asks, &quot;If Sprint'shaving trouble, how can smaller companies think aboutsucceeding?&quot;   Sprint's chairman, William T. Esrey, says such concernsare simply part of a &quot;gross overreaction&quot; to a down quarter.&quot;This is not some fundamental problem that's across theboard. It's a setback, and we took corrective action.&quot;   Still, in a memo to employees after the earnings report,Mr. Esrey said that while United Telecommunications' localphone services remained strong, &quot;US Sprint is struggling.Revenues are under expectations {and} expenses continue to betoo high. We must do two things: increase revenues and bringcosts in line -- and we must do them immediately.&quot; Last weekthe company began eliminating many jobs.   Financial analysts fear that Sprint is ill-positioned fora long-distance marketing battle that is increasinglyexpensive. &quot;This is a marketing business,&quot; says FrankGovernali, an analyst at First Boston Corp. &quot;You have tospend more to get more.&quot; Sprint's problem is that it mustsimultaneously cut its soaring costs and increase its salesefforts.   Jack B. Grubman, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebberInc., adds: &quot;MCI is buying market share, and ATandamp;T is going tomake things very tough for its competitors.&quot; He predicts that&quot;a year from now the headlines are going to read, `ATandamp;T isgaining market share.'&quot;   ATandamp;T has already sewn up numerous national accounts withmultiyear discount pricing and services plans, called Tariff12 contracts, for big corporations. And the telephone giantis forestalling defections in the consumer and small-businessmarket with a new ad campaign that tells customers to &quot;get itin writing.&quot; Further helping it compete, ATandamp;T has transferredthousands of employees out of staff jobs and into sales work.   MCI, meanwhile, is aggressively courting the low end ofthe market with increased advertising and blitztelemarketing. It has hired Pioneer Teletechnologies Inc. ofSergeant Bluff, Iowa, where hundreds of employees drum upbusiness for MCI at all hours.   MCI is also fighting to weaken Sprint's hold on 40% of themultibillion-dollar federal long-distance phone contract,called FTS-2000 (ATandamp;T has the other 60%). If MCI should winthe right to sell advanced voice and data services to federalagencies, Sprint and ATandamp;T could find themselves with a farless lucrative contract; most of what they've been able tosell so far is plain old phone service.   Yet Sprint's problems transcend competition and reflectmajor management problems, say some analysts, customers andformer Sprint executives.   They say senior executives missed a shift in thelong-distance market from a price war to a marketing battlethat stresses service. Not only are Sprint's costs out ofcontrol because of overstaffing, but its billing problems --the source of much woe in years past -- have returned with avengeance. These problems have annoyed customers and strainedrelations with Sprint's own sales people, some of whom aren'tbeing paid on time.   &quot;The last-minute surprise of the quarter's financialresults means they don't have control over their business,&quot;contends Robert B. Morris III, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co.   Not so, insists Mr. Esrey. &quot;There's a great sense ofurgency and seriousness here, but in no way a lack ofoptimism,&quot; he says. &quot;There are a couple of areas where wehaven't done what we should and we are taking correctiveaction.&quot;   Mr. Esrey says US Sprint, a company with $4 billion inannual revenue, will bounce back by cutting about 1,000 staffjobs, using fewer outside contractors and adding salespeople. The company also has a &quot;lot of development effortgoing on to bring out some new products,&quot; he says.   Others say Sprint faces some tall obstacles. One is acredibility problem with investors. At least six shareholdersuits have been filed in Kansas City federal courts allegingthat Mr. Esrey and the parent company misled investors aboutSprint's prospects.   Mr. Esrey says Sprint is &quot;doing sensationally&quot; in signingup large corporate customers. But industry watchers say thecompany hasn't won a big bid for some time. When pressed togive numbers on his national account business, Mr. Esreydeclines.   Analysts and former executives also say Sprint is fallingbehind on the amount of revenue it had planned to receivefrom the FTS-2000 federal contract by this time. Theyestimate Sprint had expected $50 million to $75 million inrevenue per quarter by this time but got only $30 million inthe second quarter.   &quot;Whoever told you that doesn't know what they're talkingabout,&quot; says Mr. Esrey, declining to give numbers. &quot;FTS is 18months ahead of schedule. Sales are going very well.&quot; Theproblem, he says, has been simply a matter of resources. &quot;Wehave been outmanned -- outpersoned -- and outgunned, by ATandamp;Tin particular,&quot; says the executive, who is lobbying hardagainst any FCC move to unshackle the industry leader.   Some current and former executives say a broad managementshift last fall preoccupied and distracted US Sprint. Mr.Esrey chose people from parent United Telecommunications fornearly all his senior management positions, including that ofSprint president (Ronald LeMay). Critics suggest that theUnited executives, used to running their highly successfulmonopoly local phone business, were ill-prepared to competewith the likes of MCI in long distance. Although MCI and ATandamp;Ttelegraphed their competitive punches, holding the line onpricing while aggressively shifting their sales pitches toemphasize service, Sprint continued running its aginghear-a-pin-drop ads. It still does.   &quot;I sit up nights and think about those&quot; ads, says Mr.Esrey. Noting that Sprint's brash move into fiber-opticspushed its rivals to rush out their own fiber systems, headds, &quot;We were there first but didn't do an effective job ofgetting this message across.&quot;   People knowledgeable about Sprint's operations say thecompany's managers also failed to attend to some details,particularly the billing situation. A phone company's mostcrucial operation beyond its switching centers is itscomputerized billing system. This must take data on millionsof calls a day from the network's switching centers, priceeach call, and turn all this into bills at the end of eachmonth.   &quot;Billing is just ungodly&quot; at Sprint, says Tom Colvin,telecommunications manager at Marshall Industries, an ElMonte, Calif., electronics parts distributor. Mr. Colvin, whoestimates his monthly Sprint bill at $170,000, says he onlyrecently received his long-distance phone bill for March,April and May. &quot;If things don't improve we're going to dropthem,&quot; he says.   Says Mr. Esrey: &quot;Occasionally we had hiccups, andsometimes we were days late.&quot;   Several top executives have left Sprint in the past fewweeks, including the man who supervised the billing systemand much of his staff, but also the manager who led Sprint'ssuccessful effort to win part of the federal phone project.United Telecommunications says their exits were unrelated tocurrent problems.   More changes are in store, and they won't be limited to&quot;the worker bee level,&quot; says Mr. Esrey. &quot;Nothing is sacred asfar as how we can be structured better.&quot;   ---                                                                                                        1990 projected U.S. long distance market share, as a percentof $48.9 billion sales*                                                                                                              ATandamp;T                          70.4%       MCI                           15.4%       Sprint                        10.6%       Telecom USA                    1.9%       Other                          1.2%                                                                                                        *Excludes approximately $27.5 billion in payments to localphone companies for access to their networks.
