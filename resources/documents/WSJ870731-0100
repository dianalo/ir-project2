Wilkis, a major figure in the Dennis B. Levine case, saying that the sentence couldn't have been more lenient.    In fact, U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure said, Mr. Wilkis's motion to reduce his sentence of a year and a day in prison and five years' probation &quot;borders on the frivolous.&quot; The judge said the former investment banker at Lazard Freres andamp; Co. and E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. had already been amply rewarded at the Feb. 9 sentencing for his contrition and for his cooperation with the government's insider-trading probe.    Gary P. Naftalis, Mr. Wilkis's attorney, he said he hadn't yet seen the judge's opinion so he couldn't comment.    Mr. Wilkis is serving his time at the federal prison in Danbury, Conn.    Mr. Wilkis had moved to reduce the sentence because of family hardship and because he said he cooperated more than another major figure in the Levine case who had won a one-third reduction in his year-and-a-day sentence from another judge. But Judge Leisure agreed with prosecutors that Mr. Wilkis's criminal conduct &quot;was far more egregious and lasted longer&quot; than that of the other figure, former Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. investment banker Ira B. Sokolow.    Mr. Wilkis last December pleaded guilty to charges of insider trading and tax evasion and to a currency violation of carrying $100,000 cash into the U.S. from the Cayman Islands without reporting it. He could have received 20 years in prison. </TEXT></DOC>
