An embassy spokesman said an internal investigation was launchedthree weeks ago when the newspaper first questioned officials aboutthe woman's story but has developed no evidence to corroborate heraccount.   ``We have not been able to corroborate this story and with theprocesses we have in place we would have expected to have foundsomething if such a gathering took place,'' spokesman Brett Baylytold The Associated Press.   He said all guests have to sign into the building and would needan escort to enter non-public areas.   Bayly said embassy officials were continuing their investigationand ``have been in touch with American authorities.'' He declinedto be more specific when asked to identify the U.S. officials oragencies that had been contacted.   The Times said the woman also provided accounts of paid sexualencounters with a Canadian diplomat and a soldier who also acted asa bodyguard to Washington lobbyist and host Craig J. Spence and thenewspaper said it was able to confirm these accounts.   The Times had previously identified Spence as a major client ofa homosexual prostitution ring that allegedly involved the escortservice for which the prostitute said she worked.   The U.S. attorney's office in Washington reportedly isinvestigating credit card fraud involving escort services.   According to the Times, the woman said she and the two otherprostitutes had sex with at least three men each at the Australianembassy and that she was paid $800 in ``crisp, new $100 bills''after the party. The newspaper said the woman asked not to beidentified.   Kunjurit Singh, who operates Jet Set escort service, confirmedto the Times that his agency employed the three women lastNovember. Singh said he would not release details of clients andsaid the agency does not condone and is not aware of any illegalsexual activities by its employees.   The newspaper said the woman provided a detailed description ofthe embassy party. She said the men ``took me one at a time'' intoa room ``which was like an office, it had office-type furniture.''   She said the men did not identify themselves.   The newspaper said it questioned embassy officials about thewoman's account on July 6 and was told officials would investigate.It said the embassy's minister for congressional liaison, JohnMcCarthy, later told the newspaper that the internal investigationhad found the woman's story ``improbable,'' although it had notruled out the possibility that such a party was held.   ``The embassy's investigations produced no corroboration of theallegations,'' said a report on the review.   The Times said the woman provided a list of embassy officialswho she said were clients, including a Canadian diplomat whoinitially denied and then confirmed his involvement. The newspaperdid not identify the official but quoted him as saying his personallife was ``none of the newspaper's business.''</TEXT></DOC>
