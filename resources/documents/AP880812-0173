James R. Donovan, the court's director of data systems, said thecourt ``tentatively contemplates a one-to-three-year experiment,with the period of review based in part on the outside entity'sinvestment.   In a letter to legal publishers, legal research data baseproviders and news wire services, Donovan invited ``preliminaryproposals'' but said the court reserves ``the right not to pursuethe project beyond the acceptance of preliminary proposals.''   In making public a copy of Donovan's letter, court spokeswomanToni House called the solicitation of proposals a ``first steptoward making (the court's) opinions available via computer.''   Donovan's letter said the court's evaluation of the proposalswould include, among others, these considerations:   _Whether the opinions will be equally available to allinterested parties.   _Whether a proposal favors or appears to favor one distributoror group of distributors.   _Whether the project would be conducted by a not-for-profitorganization or on a not-for-profit basis.   _Whether the project would be conducted by a consortium of or asa joint project of a number of interested parties.   The court currently releases only printed copies of its opinionson the day they are released from the bench. The court has nomethod of general, same-day dissemination of its opinions beyondWashington.   Donovan said the move to computerized delivery of opinions isbeing contemplated because ``the court recognizes its uniqueposition in the American judicial system and the unique nature ofits product.''</TEXT></DOC>
