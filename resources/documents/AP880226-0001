Balaguer also asked for his entire Cabinet's resignation, sayingit had to be ``restructured to respond to the presentcircumstances.''   In the central and northeastern provinces, police battleddemonstrators who blocked the main avenues in the cities and threwrocks at police and commercial establishments.   Late Thursday, authorities said a 72-hour strike had ended ineast-central Sanchez Ramirez province, where protests started 11years ago. Peasants there demonstrated against alleged cyanide andsulfur contamination of rivers from a state-owned gold mine.   Earlier, company officials denied any contamination existed butsaid that up to 130 families would be moved to a farm inside theprovince away from the mine.   The protests, which grew to include other issues, have been theworst since Balaguer took office 1{ years ago in this Caribbeanisland nation of more than 6.5 million people.   In Azua, 75 miles west of the capital city of Santo Domingo,protesters detonated homemade bombs and burned tires in some areas,but police said most of the town was under control.   A 15-year-old newspaper vendor shot in Azua on Wednesday wasreported to have died. Two other people were killed Wednesday.   More than a dozen people have been reported wounded by gunfireand an undetermined number have been arrested in the eightprovinces affected by the unrest.   Much of the country's commercial activity has been paralyzed andschools remained closed.   The protests spread to other parts of the country, whereresidents demanded capital improvements and government action tocontrol inflation estimated at about 30 percent annually.   Balaguer went on television to deliver his message from theNational Palace shortly after midnight Wednesday. He said thegovernment would tolerate public protests as long as they werepeaceful but would not accept acts of vandalism and violence.   ``If the circumstances demand it ... we will confront thesedemonstrations and use all the military and physical power thestate has to stop them,'' he said.   He added, however, that his government would not repeat theevents in 1984, when soldiers shot and killed almost 100 peopledemonstrating against price increases.   ``We won't have a slaughter like the one April 23, 24 and 25,1984,'' he said.   There was no word on whether the Cabinet had submitted itsresignation and no replacements were announced.</TEXT></DOC>
