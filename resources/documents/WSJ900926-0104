The government said it hoped that allowing Chinesenationals to seek employment with Hong Kong companies wouldhelp offset the steady departure of professionals from theterritory in the run-up to 1997, when Hong Kong reverts toChinese rule. Political observers and others outside thegovernment, however, said local authorities have bowed toBeijing's demands that they allow an increased flow ofChinese nationals into the territory.   Under current regulations, mainland Chinese enter the HongKong labor market by only two routes: a one-way immigrantvisa, granted to 75 Chinese nationals each day; orsponsorship by a mainland employer operating in theterritory. Under the new policy, Chinese nationals who havelived overseas for at least the past two years may apply forjobs with private Hong Kong companies.   Separately, Hong Kong Tourist Association Chairman MartinBarrow disclaimed an earlier zero-growth forecast for 1990tourism and predicted 8% growth instead. He cited gains inarrivals from Southeast Asian countries and from Taiwan,Japan and South Korea.                                                                                                          SPANISH THEME-PARK ROW                                                                                                          In a last-minute effort to salvage plans by Anheuser-BuschCos. to build a multimillion-dollar theme park and resort innortheastern Spain, a top official with the Catalonianregional government is traveling to St. Louis for directtalks with the U.S. brewing company. The city ofVilaseca-Salou, in which the project was to be built,recently split into two warring municipalities, one of whichnow refuses to allow the park to be built within city limits.Anheuser-Busch last month threatened to relocate the project.

Honda isstudying the feasibility of offering such support, aspokesman said, adding that the companies are interested inHonda's small-engine technology.

Among those are a drive to improvewater quality and a pledge to phase out ozone-depleting gasesby 1997.
