Neither of the computer networks involved handled classified dataor information, but the links between the two were ``temporarilysevered ... in order to provide a barrier to protect users,'' thedepartment said in a statement.   The connections between the Arpanet network, which links academicand corporate computer centers and which was attacked by a ``virus''last month, and the so-called Milnet system, which links thousandsof military computers, were severed Monday.   The Pentagon said the connection was broken after ``anunidentified hacker penetrated a VAX computer belonging to a defensecontractor on the night of Nov. 27-28, 1988.''   ``The hacker used a weakness in the end user's computer software.The `fix' for this problem has been developed by the vendor and isavailable electronically to users of the software,'' the Pentagonsaid.   Amateur computer users who try to make unauthorized entry intocomputer systems or networks are known as hackers.   The Pentagon did not identify the contractor, but a spokeswomanfor the Mitre Corp. in Bedford, Mass., Marcia Cohen, said one of thecompany's computers had been entered.   The connections between Arpanet and Milnet were expected to berestored Thursday. The two networks are connected at sevenelectronic gateways around the country.   ``The contractor's programmers have taken corrective measures toprevent any recurrence,'' the Pentagon added.   Arpanet is the same unclassified computer network that wascrippled last month when someone slipped a ``virus'' into the system_ an incident that is being investigated by a federal grand jury inSyracuse.   The virus, a self-copying program which can cripple computeroperations by soaking up capacity or destroying data, jammed anestimated 6,000 computers nationwide. The virus attack caused atleast $97 million in damage because of interrupted work and the needto cleanse the computers, according to the Computer Virus IndustryAssociation.   Authorities believe the virus program was created by CornellUniversity graduate student Robert Morris Jr., 23, of Arnold, Md.   FBI agents in Massachusetts last week subpoenaed three people atHarvard University, where Morris was a computer scienceundergraduate until June. Two Harvard computer experts, graduatestudent Paul Graham and computer programmer Andrew H. Suddeth,appeared before the grand jury Wednesday.   Suddeth has said Morris called him in a panic for help in gettingout a message to other computer operators after Morris realized whatthe virus was doing.   The third person subpoenaed, Mark Friedell, an associateprofessor of computer science, was excused from testifying. He saidhe told prosecutors he knew nothing of the allegations of Morris'involvement with the virus.   Morris has not been subpoenaed to appear before the panel, hislawyer, Thomas Guidoboni of Washington, told the SyracuseHerald-Journal.   Guidoboni so far has advised Morris not to talk with anyone aboutthe virus, including FBI agents. But the lawyer said an agreementmay soon be reached in which an interview with agents would bearranged.</TEXT></DOC>
