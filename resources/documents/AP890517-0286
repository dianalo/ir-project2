The object of the licensing is to prevent strategic items fromfalling into the hands of the Soviets or terrorist groups.   James M. LeMunyon, deputy assistant secretary for exportadministration, said some of the allies are considering liftingsimilar restrictions on trade among them. He reported thatrepresentatives of several governments recently told him theywanted to follow the U.S. lead, although he declined to name thecountries.   LeMunyon was referring to goods traded among the 16 membercountries of the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls, apublicity-shy body known as Cocom headquartered in Paris. Itincludes Japan and all the countries in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization except Iceland.   LeMunyon said last year the United States required 96,000licenses for exports to these countries of goods worth about $100billion. A new regulation will cut down the kinds of technology forwhich licenses are required.   ``About 20,000 licenses will be eliminated by this oneregulation,'' he said.   LeMunyon would not give a precise date for when the newregulation will go into effect, but said that in order to get itout sooner, he was delaying consideration of one provision thatwould eliminate additional licenses.   LeMunyon spoke at a meeting called by the Aspen Institute, aprivate policy study group, held in a committee room of the Houseof Representatives.   Among the speakers urging relaxation of export restrictions wasRep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn, the new chairman of the subcommittee oninternational economic policy of the House Foreign AffairsCommittee.   ``We have a real opportunity for a change in export controls,''he said.   Gejdenson suggested that since the Soviets have withdrawn theirforces from Afghanistan, it's time to lift the restrictions formerPresident Carter imposed on exports to the Soviet Union when itstroops marched into that country nearly 10 years ago.   Gejdenson predicted that President Bush will take a morepersonal interest in export controls than did former PresidentReagan, and said that would lessen what he called the ``lopsidedcontrol'' by the Defense Department. Under Reagan, the Departmentsof Defense and Commerce frequently clashed on what exports shouldor should not be exported to the allies.   One major change under the Bush administration has been thedeparture of Richard Perle, an assistant secretary of Defense whois a strong advocate of limiting shipments.   Mitchell B. Wallerstein of the National Research Council, anofficial government advisory body, said in 180 instances eitherReagan or a top aide had to make a decision on issuing a license.That was no way to run a railroad, he commented.   Harlan Cleveland, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, presented areport urging further paring of which items need a license forshipment to Cocom members. The object is to focus attention onitems considered most important to deny to the Soviets.   ``We need higher fences around fewer products,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
