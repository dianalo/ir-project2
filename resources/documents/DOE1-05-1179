Certain of theserelationships are found in a number of the approaches to advanced controland in that sense may be said to be generic computations. One of themost important of these for robot manipulators is the Jacobian. Thischapter will address issues in implementing special-purpose, systolicarchitectures for the Jacobian.</TEXT></DOC>
