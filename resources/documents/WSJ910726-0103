Arco's prospective cuts, which probably won't affect itsAlaskan operations, follow an announcement earlier this monthby Shell Oil Co. of plans to eliminate between 10% and 15% ofits 31,000-member work force and raise questions whether theoil industry may be in for yet another round of layoffs andearly retirements.</LP><TEXT>   Industry analysts found it particularly striking that acompany regarded as one of the industry's leanest is planningsubstantial reductions. However, they differed on whetherother major companies soon will follow Arco's lead. &quot;It willdepend on how far into the future people see current trendscontinuing,&quot; said William H. Brown III, at Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co.   While details of the reductions aren't known, Arcoofficials confirmed that plans are under review and that somein the oil company's staff have been notified. Variouspackages of early retirement and severance are expected thatwould reduce the work force by between 5% and 10%.   The financial implications of Arco's steps weren't clear.A spokesman said the company &quot;isn't in a position at thistime to comment&quot; on whether one-time charges would resultfrom the job reductions. Nor would the spokesman say overwhat period the cuts might take place.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Arcoshares rose 12.5 cents to $121.75.   After record profits last year, Arco, like other major oilcompanies, posted disappointing results in recent months. OnMonday, it reported a 37% drop in second-quarter net, to $246million, or $1.51 a share. Revenue rose 5% to $4.24 billion.   Arco's planned reductions, however, are thought to bedriven by longer-term views of parts of its business, notablyits usually very profitable West Coast refining and marketingoperations and its struggling U.S. natural gas and oiloperations other than in Alaska.   Lodwrick Cook, chairman and chief executive officer,declined to discuss the prospective work force reductions indetail but characterized them as &quot;a midcourse correction,&quot;adding that &quot;we have some toning up to do.&quot;   Arco, like other major oil companies, has beenparticularly hard pressed by weak markets for its enormousnatural gas reserves. The company said its average domesticprice per thousand cubic feet slid to $1.38 in the secondquarter from an already depressed $1.66 average last year.Gas production tumbled 15%, to 1.4 million cubic feet a day.   It is thought that a large portion of prospective job cutsmay come in the Arco Oil andamp; Gas Co. unit, based in Dallas,which oversees company petroleum exploration and productionoperations in the U.S. other than in Alaska, where Arco'sgiant Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River fields are run by aseparate unit.   William E. Wade Jr., president of the Arco Oil andamp; Gas unit,said: &quot;We are working on a process that is a fundamentalre-evaluation of our business.&quot; He declined to be morespecific, but said that employees have been told that&quot;something is coming that we think will be quite material&quot;and that they will learn of it first.   Arco's pending action, coupled with Shell's earlierannouncement, suggests that &quot;companies are really about tobite the bullet on domestic exploration and productionoperations, where returns have been unacceptable for the lastfew years,&quot; said Michael Young, an analyst at Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Cuts, although less severe, are also expected at the ArcoProducts Co. unit that runs the company's refining andmarketing operations on the West Coast. That is somewhatsurprising, given that Arco Products is a leader in gasolinesales, with about 20% of the Western market, and last yearchurned out a record $439 million after-tax profit. Thecompany has continued to expand and update a network of about1,500 branded gasoline outlets.   Analysts speculated that employment cuts at refining andmarketing may be driven as much by a push for managementrealignment as by a need to cut costs. Reductions couldinvolve various middle-level staff, they speculated.   George Babikian, president of the Arco Products unit,declined to discuss details but said &quot;we have beenre-examining a lot of things to make sure that we aren'tgrowing fat.&quot;   West Coast gasoline demand has recently dropped anestimated 3%. And profit margins have plunged. However, Arcois seen as the strongest competitor in the market.</TEXT></DOC>
