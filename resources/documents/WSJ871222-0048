Analysts and traders said the now-deflated market is waiting for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' response to the plunging prices caused by its unsuccessful meeting in Vienna.    Early yesterday, a statement by Indonesia's mines and energy minister that OPEC may call an emergency meeting and take &quot;corrective measures&quot; to prop prices helped spur a brief rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But the rally didn't last.    In London, the benchmark North Sea Brent crude for January delivery closed in moderate trading at $15.90 a barrel, down 25 cents.    On the New York Merc, the January-delivery crude contract, in aggressive selling caused by its expiration yesterday, closed at $15.16 a barrel, down 42 cents. The most active contract, for February delivery, settled unchanged at $15.40 a barrel; heatingoil and gasoline prices rose.    Analysts, predicting crude prices will fall still further in coming weeks, gave little heed to the statement by Subroto, the Indonesia minister, about OPEC's possible actions.    &quot;At the current stage . . . I don't think anyone in OPEC has really panicked. I don't think prices are really low enough for anyone to call for an emergency meeting,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    &quot;The market just hasn't been able to hold a rally,&quot; said Richard D. Donovan, head of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.'s internationalenergy department. But he said that despite the fall in January-delivery prices, oil prices overall were unchanged or higher. Heating oil for nearby delivery was up 0.62 cent, to 49.35 cents; gasoline closed 0.34 cent higher, at 41.28 cents.    &quot;I think the record-volume days of last week have happened and I expect some bouncing around. There'll probably be new lows down the road but not right away,&quot; Mr. Donovan said. He predicted the market will do some &quot;fine tuning&quot; this week after last week's plunge.    Mr. Donovan said Thursday's February-contract low of $14.73 a barrel is probably the &quot;soft floor&quot; of the market, and that prices will bounce between that level and $16 for &quot;some time to come.&quot;    Traders explained that the weakness in the expiring January crude contract was caused by heavy selling of futures contracts by certain oil producers, which had been hoping the market would rebound somewhat. Such a rebound didn't materialize but many of the producers, as part of prior commitments to deliver oil, had to sell contracts anyway before yesterday's expiration.    &quot;The oil producers that had sales agreements had been waiting for better opportunities,&quot; but the opportunities didn't materialize, said Eric T. Bolling, vice president at Geldermann Inc., energy brokers.    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $15.15, down 45 cents.    Mr. Barakat said that overall, &quot;OPEC continues to define the bigger picture.&quot; Despite the statement by the Indonesian minister and other rumors that OPEC may try to shore up prices, that picture is still &quot;negative,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: A continued dearth of supply, rumors of production problems and accelerating consumption helped copper prices soar to their highest levels in seven years. On the New York Commodity Exchange, December-delivery copper rose 3.2 cents to $1.31 a pound. The most active contract, for March delivery, hit a contract high of $1.179 a pound, up 4.1 cents. London Metal Exchange warehouse supplies fell 7,500 tons, to 42,875 tons. Comex stocks fell 1,063 tons to 21,502 tons. While some plants have closed because of supply problems, others, which have copper, are taking advantage of the situation by operating through the normal vacation closing period. &quot;The (supply/demand) situation will probably get worse before it gets better,&quot; said Frederick Demler, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s metals economist.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean-futures prices jumped for the third consecutive trading day. The drop in prices earlier this month amid profit-taking is attracting buyers, said Hugh Ulrich, president of Commodity Center Corp., Chicago. Moreover, seasonal factors are helping to support prices. In the winter, the U.S. becomes the major supplier of soybean meal to world markets. Export competition won't emerge until the spring from South America, where soybean crops are now being planted. Demand by livestock operators for soybean meal also climbs in the winter because cattle have to consume more feed to keep their weight in cold weather, said Margaret C. Lamason, an analyst at Cargill Investor Services, Chicago. Corn and wheat prices fell.    STOCK INDEXES: Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures for March settlement rose on light volume as the dollar and crude oil traded in a relatively narrow range. The stock-index rise continued a rally that, in part, has been driven by some traders turning more optimistic about corporate earnings. &quot;We've seen some good fundamentals for the U.S. economy so far,&quot; said Gerald Walsh, an analyst at Refco Inc., New York. Analysts expect the rally to continue, although light trading volume before the Christmas holiday makes the market vulnerable to wide price swings. </TEXT></DOC>
