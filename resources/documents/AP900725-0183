It was the maid, and for solving the ``murder mystery'' on atrain from Chicago to New York, Larry Wall won a ride Wednesday onthe storied Orient Express and a chance to win the internationalcompetition for CLUE, the board game.   Wall, who calls himself the most ardent of Agatha Christie'sfans, stands crowned as the first-ever national CLUE champion.   ``The hardest thing to do is getting rid of the clues that don'tmean anything and then if you look at what's left, you can solveit,'' said Wall, surrounded by actors who portrayed characters suchas Professor Plum, Col. Mustard and Miss Scarlett from the ParkerBrothers' detective game.   The traveling CLUE contest began in Chicago Tuesday when thecontestant-detectives investigated the ``murder'' of a Mr. Boddy atUnion Station. Later, aboard the train, another character,Professor Plum, met an untimely death.   The cast of characters and five amateur sleuths arrived at NewYork's Penn Station after a day-long mystery ride aboard theluxurious American-European Express train from Chicago.   While on board, Wall and the other detectives quizzed thecharacters, sifted clues from a scavenger hunt in Chicago and kepttheir theories to themselves.   Wall, the owner of an electronics company, said he heard aboutthe contest through another interactive murder mystery game he hadattended.   ``When I heard there was a chance to get on the Orient Express,obviously, I was very excited,'' said Wall, of Winston-Salem, N.C.He said he has won two similar contests.   For the record, Mrs. White ``killed'' Boddy and Plum to avenge adeceitful act from 15 years ago. Boddy, aided by Professor Plum,had forced a company owned by Mrs. White's father into bankruptcy.   After the contestants submitted their theories on the Boddymurder and its motivation, the actors played the final scene, inwhich the maid revealed herself as Mrs. White and entered the stagewith a gun in her hand.   ``I came out no longer the maid but as Mrs. White,'' saidactress Susan Tabor, who played the character. ``I said, `Get outof my way, this gun is a small gun but it shoots big bullets.' Andthen I got shot. So I'm dead.'''   And so begins another mystery: ``The Case of the TalkingCorpse.''</TEXT></DOC>
