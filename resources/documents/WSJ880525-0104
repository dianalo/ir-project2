Miller and Robert Daniels (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> SGP COO </CO><IN> TNM PHA </IN><TEXT>   Cooper Cos. tentatively agreed to a revised pact designed to resurrect a previously canceled sale of its contact lens business to a unit of Schering-Plough Corp.    A spokesman for the Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of medical products said the proposed pact doesn't change Cooper's plans to sell the entire company. Cooper Chairman Parker G. Montgomery put the cash-strapped company on the block, either as a whole or in segments, after the earlier agreement with Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough was scotched by federal antitrust concerns.    The new agreement in principle calls for Schering-Plough to pay $195 million to acquire Cooper's world-wide contact lens business and its U.S. lens solution business. In January, Cooper announced it would sell the lens business to Schering-Plough's unit for $150 million. Cooper subsequently agreed to sell the solution operation for an additional $63 million, contingent on successful completion of the lens acquisition.    But in late April, federal regulators indicated they would ask a court to block Schering-Plough's acquisition of the contact lens business because the drug concern's Wesley-Jessen unit is a direct competitor with Cooper in that field. Schering-Plough, citing the regulators' opposition, this month canceled the contact lens agreement, as well as the related transaction for the solution operations.    The revised agreement excludes Cooper's business that makes color contact lenses, and also would make Cooper's lens-molding technology available for licensing to vision-care companies. The tentative pact is subject to approval by federal regulators.    In Washington, a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission declined to comment on the company's announcement. She said that the agency hasn't filed suit to block the transaction, but &quot;that remains one of the options&quot; under review by FTC officials.    Cooper needs cash to pay off the heavy debt load it took on from acquisitions designed to let it move out of the optometric field and focus on medical diagnostics. A spokesman said: &quot;It's my understanding that at the present time we are in compliance&quot; with the company's debt covenants, but declined comment on whether the company foresees any difficulties in meeting its near-term obligations. In recent weeks, Cooper shares have been under increasing pressure from short-sellers.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cooper shares closed at $12.50, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
