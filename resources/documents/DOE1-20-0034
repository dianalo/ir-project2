<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-0034 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method of controlling the idle speed of an internal combustion engineis described comprising a crank angle sensor for detecting the rotationsof the internal combustion engine, an air flow sensor for detecting theflow rate of air supplied to the engine, fuel supply means for controllingthe amount of fuel supplied to the engine, a sensor for detecting thatthe engine is in an idle state, means for effecting a feed-back controlof an idle rotation speed to a predetermined value by controlling theamount of air supplied to the engine, and an electronic control unitcapable of detecting an abnormal idle speed control condition in whichthe engine speed exceeds a predetermined value in the idle state on thebasis of electrical signals from the sensors. The method comprises thesteps of counting the number of times fuel is supplied to the enginewhen the electronic control unit detects the abnormal idle speed controlcondition and suspending the fuel supply to at least one cylinder ofthe engine each time the count reaches a predetermined value.</TEXT></DOC>
