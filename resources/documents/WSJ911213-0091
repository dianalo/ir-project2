The forecast, part of the Paris-based group's semiannual&quot;Economic Outlook&quot; to be published Thursday, cites a solidbase for growth. Though the OECD has scaled back considerablyits projections for next year's economic activity in five ofthe Group of Seven industrial democracies, it remainedoptimistic that the recovery in 1993 will be strong, reachingan annual growth rate of 3.3%.   For the OECD as a whole, the report seesinflation-adjusted growth of 2.2% next year, down from its2.9% projection last July. But subsequent growth also couldaccelerate to 3.3%.   The U.S. economy is expected to grow at a 2.2% annual ratenext year after contracting 0.5% this year, but pick up speedin 1993 to 3.8%. These projections were revised downward fromthe OECD's July estimate of 3.1% growth next year after acontraction of 0.2% this year.                                                                                                          CLEANING UP EASTERN GERMANY                                                                                                          A cleanup of eastern Germany's severely polluted centralindustrial belt will cost $11 billion, agovernment-commissioned report said. The previouslycommunist-run chemical and energy industries polluted the airand poisoned the land with chemical discharges andtoxic-waste dumps in the region. The cleanup would be thebiggest single environmental rescue plan in the dilapidatedeast and would encourage Western investment needed to averteconomic collapse there. The region's industrial emissionsstill exceed by as much as 100 times the permissible westernGerman levels.                                                                                                          SUHARTO PLAYS DOWN SHOOTING                                                                                                          Indonesian President Suharto termed the Nov. 12 shootingof anti-Jakarta demonstrators in East Timor a &quot;small matter&quot;exaggerated by Western nations and foreign media. Themilitary says 19 people were killed when soldiers shot inself-defense at rioting protesters; witnesses say at least100 died when troops fired without warning on unarmedmarchers. In his first remarks on the incident, Mr. Suhartoalso said Jakarta would reject foreign aid with politicalconditions, an apparent reference to Canadian and Dutchsuspensions of new aid projects because of the shootings.                                                                                                          PHILIPPINE BUSINESS OUTLOOK                                                                                                          The Philippine business community is projecting 2% to 3%growth for the nation's economy next year after an expectedbottoming-out this year. The Philippine Chamber of Commerceand Industry said Manila has laid the groundwork for aneconomic takeoff by easing entry for foreign investors andrevamping tariffs, among other actions. But it said anyrebound will hinge partly on controlling the governmentbudget deficit.                                                                                                          KUWAIT SIGNS REBUILDING PACT                                                                                                          Kuwait signed its previously announced $5.5 billion loanaccord and probably won't need to borrow further to fundpost-war reconstruction. The emirate can draw instead on anadditional $5.5 billion of export credit agreements providedby industrialized nations. Kuwait has an estimated $60billion of overseas assets and said it doesn't intend to sellany of these investments to finance rebuilding. The five-yearreconstruction deal, provided by 81 banks from 20 countries,was described as the largest voluntary syndicated loan everextended to a sovereign borrower.                                                                                                          ISRAELI UNEMPLOYMENT HITS A HIGH                                                                                                          Unemployment in Israel at Sept. 30 rose to a record highof 11%, because of the influx of Soviet Jews. The rate wasseven percentage points higher than at the end of 1990. Since1989, an immigration wave has brought 400,000 people into thestate. Israel created 90,000 jobs this year, but thissatisfied only 75% of demand. It plans an additional 90,000new jobs for next year, but 400,000 more Soviet Jews couldarrive in 1992 alone.                                                                                                          EC CLEARS `ECOLOGY' LABEL                                                                                                          European Community environment ministers agreed to createa special &quot;green&quot; label for products that meet strictenvironmental criteria on production and packaging, possiblyby next fall.   The so-called eco-labeling program &quot;responds to consumerdemands for better information,&quot; an EC aide said. &quot;It willencourage producers to coordinate their products vis-a-visthe environment&quot; by encouraging less-polluting manufacturingprocesses. The EC will form a panel of consumers, producersand specialists to determine product groups and criteriarequired for the eco-label.   EC members will be responsible for awarding the label toproducts made in their nations or imported. The voluntaryprogram will exclude foodstuffs, beverages andpharmaceuticals.   The plan aims to channel the spending power of a growingnumber of environmentally concerned consumers into &quot;cleaner&quot;products and stop some producers' dubious environmentalclaims.
