Terms weren't disclosed.    As previously reported, about 400 employees at the plastic-pellet and rail-car plant walked off the job in early August, reducing rail-car production. Employees began returning to work yesterday. Trinity said the strike won't have any impact on the metal fabricator's earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
