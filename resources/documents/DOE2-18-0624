Interviewswere conducted with energy conservation professionals to identify andevaluate existing energy conservation programs, and interviews were conductedwith consumers who had evaluated selected programs previously reviewedby the professionals. Information was also gathered on energy conservationactivities of consumers surveyed. A directory of 34 energy conservationprograms was also compiled. Some of the conclusions reached in this reportare as follows. There is a need for an information system to gather dataon existing conservation programs in order to increase the knowledgeof relevant parties as to the outcomes of operating programs. This wouldhelp evaluation and improvement of current programs and suggest new programpossibilities. The professionals rated six of the 34 programs highly,including the Energuide and the Canadian Home Insulation Program (CHIP).Retrofitting programs for houses are recommended for continuation andexpansion, with some consideration given to linking these kinds of programswith home audit programs. In the private transport sector, any new conservationprograms should be thoroughly tested on a small scale before widespreadimplementation, as evidence indicates that certain programs favorablyevaluated by professionals may not be received favorably by consumers.3 refs., 24 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
