Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ELE MON </IN><TEXT>   Richard Gephardt may have retired from the presidential race and Congress's trade bill may have lost its elan, but some protectionists -- sorry, I mean &quot;economic nationalists&quot; -- just can't leave well enough alone. Their latest public-policy salient is on behalf of something called &quot;managed trade.&quot; If this sounds weirdly familiar, you're probably in the computer business (more on that below).    A Washington vogue this year is to fret about the decline, or at least &quot;relative decline,&quot; of America. The merits of this view have been disputed by Jeane Kirkpatrick among others, but more significant is what the denizens of decline actually propose to do about it. Candidate Gephardt's trade-retaliation amendment was one idea, but that was recently interred by Congress after its author fell in battle.    Now, like Pickett's charge, comes &quot;managed trade.&quot; Liberal Democrat thinker Pat Choate proposes in the Harvard Business Review a policy of &quot;tailored trade&quot; with such &quot;plan-directed&quot; nations as Japan. The U.S. wouldn't just work to establish free- and fair-trade rules, as it has under such anachronisms as the GATT, says Mr. Choate. Its trade policy instead would be &quot;results-oriented, concentrating on outcomes, timetables. . . .&quot; His clear implication is that Washington should help U.S. companies by deciding with other governments how to divide up world markets.    Republican corporatists also like the idea. Clyde Prestowitz Jr., a former Reagan official, has just come out with a book arguing that only a new &quot;managed-trade&quot; policy can save the U.S. from &quot;becoming a colonial territory again.&quot; The book seems destined for a warm reception, since its jacket includes bipartisan encomiums from the likes of Lee Iacocca, Missouri Sen. John Danforth, and the president of the United Steel Workers. Like Mr. Choate, Mr. Prestowitz argues that free trade is merely a &quot;doctrine&quot; or ideology, while his own proposals are &quot;pragmatic.&quot;    Well, as it happens, we've been able to see just how pragmatic. Thanks to Mr. Prestowitz's dogged efforts at the Commerce Department, the U.S. gave managed trade a test run by signing the 1986 accord on computer chips with Japan. The idea and its consequences haven't received the negative publicity they deserve.    What Mr. Prestowitz did was try to assist the U.S. chip industry by working with Japanese bureaucrats to establish a global cartel, an OPEC for computer chips. In what he calls a &quot;supreme irony,&quot; American free-traders coerced Japan into fixing prices and controlling chip production. And it has worked about as well as OPEC has. Sure, the accord helped the two (that's right, just two) U.S. makers of the most basic kind of computer chip -- what the techies call DRAMs -- because what business couldn't stand a little price-fixing?    But the losers? They include the rest of us -- companies that make things that contain chips and those who buy what those companies make. Kenneth Flamm, an economist at the Brookings Institution, figures the price of a DRAM that sold for $2.50 in 1986 now sells for $10. That can add up to an increase of $100 to $200 for a personal computer that sells for only a few hundred dollars.    A booming computer market and a change to a new generation of more powerful chips have also contributed to the price increases, but in a free market, producers could adjust to new demand. Since they can't adjust now, chip shortages are widespread. Tektronix Corp. of Portland, Ore., for example, uses a &quot;video RAM&quot; that isn't even made in the U.S. Yet the chip pact limits even its importation, and the video RAM's price has doubled in three months, according to Tektronix's Roger Majak.    How about enhancing U.S. &quot;competitiveness&quot;? The Japanese, our arch-rivals in Mr. Prestowitz's saga, actually love the chip pact. Rather than having to compete by cutting prices, Japanese chip makers simply rake in monopoly profits. Naturally, they're now reinvesting those profits into higher-technology products in which American companies still lead the world. Mr. Majak adds that chip shortages have even forced Tektronix to fall away from so-called &quot;just-in-time&quot; manufacturing, a way of controlling inventory costs that gurus like Mr. Prestowitz keep urging them to employ.    Beyond this one debacle, the broader point is that &quot;managed trade&quot; diminishes America's greatest comparative advantages -- its innovation and dynamism. By allowing bureaucrats to divide up markets, it limits the growth and innovation of America's high-tech industries that hope to expand their global market share. &quot;In cases where we're most competitive,&quot; says Brookings' Mr. Flamm, &quot;managed trade is going to take markets away from us.&quot;    Indeed, journalist George Gilder argued recently in Forbes that chip technology already is moving into areas where U.S. advantages will again assert themselves -- in individual design rather than in efficient mass production. Maybe the Japanese aren't going to colonize us after all.    Meantime, however, an iron rule in Washington is that bad policy has few parents, so the Reagan administration doesn't say much about the chip pact. The official line is still that it's successful, though lobbyists for the chip users have quietly sought to have it changed.    The lobbyists for the chip makers naturally want to keep it in place, though even they aren't too vocal anymore. So perhaps Mr. Prestowitz at least deserves an award for candor. He may be the first person in history to admit to promoting a policy with results that refute much of his own book. </TEXT></DOC>
