Gorbachevon economic reform admitted that all economic changes to datein his country have failed and appealed to Westerneconomists, businessmen and governments to help out.   &quot;If the West would help, this would in fact make the wholedifference,&quot; Stanislav Shatalin said at a news conferencecalled to discuss a plan to have Western experts reviewSoviet and East European economic-reform plans. He added: &quot;Wehave come to a very profound conclusion that without thecooperation of the West, we simply can't build a marketeconomy.&quot;   Mr. Shatalin noted that many Soviets oppose a marketeconomy and the price hikes and unemployment almost certainto come with it. He cited a poll that he said showed 54% ofSoviets are for market reforms but 46% against them.   Mr. Shatalin said the Soviet Union has decided, along withother East European nations, to join a new program unitingsome 50 top experts to cull through Soviet and East Europeanreforms before they are implemented. The program is being runby the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysisin Austria.                                                                                                          A FLOP IN LONDON                                                                                                          &quot;King,&quot; a $5 million London stage musical about MartinLuther King Jr., will close on June 2 after only six weeks.The show's producers blamed the failure on publicity aboutproblems affecting the production before it opened and on badreviews. The Daily Mail critic said &quot;King&quot; had taken anexciting subject and &quot;driven it into the ground under theweight of good intent.&quot; The producers said &quot;King&quot; was gettingnightly ovations but had only $170,000 in advance bookings.                                                                                                          ASSURANCES FOR AUSTRALIA                                                                                                          The Soviet Union has given official assurances it will pay130 million Australian dollars (US$99 million) it owes forAustralian wool later this week or early next week, anAustralian government official said. Neal Blewett,Australia's Trade Negotiations Minister, told parliament thatthe Australian ambassador had met Soviet government officialsin Moscow Wednesday to register Australia's concern about thedelay in paying Australian wool exporters. Mr. Blewett saidthe delay in payments appeared to be caused by areorganization of the Soviet foreign-trade system rather thanto any default.                                                                                                          COLOMBIAN PROJECT                                                                                                          Toyota Motor Corp. announced it would manufacturecommercial vehicles in Colombia in a joint project with asubsidiary of France's Renault and Mitsui andamp; Co., a majorJapanese trading house. Toyota officials said their company,Japan's biggest car maker, has signed agreements withSociedad de Fabrication de Automotores Renault S.A. andMitsui. Under the agreement, they said, Bogota-basedSOFASA-Renault will add Toyota's Land Cruiser and Hiluxmodels to the line of Renault cars it has been producing.                                                                                                          REFORMULATING SWEDISH BEER                                                                                                          Sweden's leading brewers said they would lower the alcohollevel in their strongest beer from 4.5% to 4% after thegovernment said it might increase taxes on alcohol and linkthem to the potency of the brew. But the brewers insistedtheir decision was because of taste, not taxes. &quot;The taste isbetter at a lower level,&quot; said Katrin Andersson at theSwedish Brewers' Association. Authorities said the proposedtax increase would cut alcohol consumption by 10%.                                                                                                          FRANCE'S POLLUTION TAX                                                                                                          France this month became the first nation to institute atax on air pollution. Under the new law, emissions of sulfurdioxide will be charged at a rate of 150 francs ($27) perton. The Ministry of the Environment will collect the taxes.Ministry officials said the revenues would be used for suchpurposes as measuring and reducing air pollution, includinggrants for installation of anti-pollution measures.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN TOBACCO ADS                                                                                                          Britain and West Germany blocked a European Community billrestricting tobacco ads in the press and on billboards.   The 12 health ministers of the EC unanimously agreed onthe need to limit advertising, but opinions diverged on howand to what extent to do it. A ban on television tobaccoadvertising already exists in all member states.   Most EC member countries were in favor of a total ban ontobacco advertising, and some already have such a ban.However, the German representative said banning a legalproduct raised a constitutional problem, while the Britishrepresentative said he preferred a voluntary restrictionsystem.   The ministers decided that the tar yield in all cigarettessold in Europe will be 15 milligrams by the end of 1992 and12 milligrams by the end of 1993. The current levels rangefrom 15 to 20.

Members of France's National Independent Union ofGuardians and Concierges are staging a protest at the CannesFilm Festival tomorrow and plan to burn a broom in front ofthe festival center.
