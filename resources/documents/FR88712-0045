The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906June 16, 1987).Crop Genetics International of Hanover, Maryland (Crop Genetics), has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of a geneticallyengineered plant-associated microorganism (recombinant bacterium). Thepermit would allow Crop Genetics to conduct a limited field test of a recombinantbacterium, <T3>Clavibacter xyli</T3> subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>genetically engineered to express the delta-endotoxingene of <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis</T3> var. <T3>kurstaki.</T3> The field test is to be carried out in two small testplots on agricultural land in Queen Annes and Prince Georges Counties,Maryland. The delta-endotoxin gene has been inserted into <T3>C. xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis</T3> to enable the recombinant bacterium to act as an insecticideagainst the larval stages (caterpillars) of lepidopteran insects.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a new plant pest and will also not have any significant impact on thequality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by Crop Genetics, as well as review of otherrelevant literature, provides the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. The inserted delta-endotoxin gene is lost rapidly from <T3>C. xyli</T3> subsp. <T3>cynodontis.</T3> Both the revertant (which has lost the delta-endotoxingene) and the naturally occurring <T3>C. xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis</T3> strains grow faster than the recombinant bacterium.This information shows that the delta-endotoxin gene will eventually belost from the recombinant bacterium.2. The genetic alterations are not expected to enhance any plant pathogenicproperty of the recombinant as compared to the parental strain of <T3>C. xyli</T3> subsp. <T3>cynodontis</T3> that occurs naturally in Maryland where this test isto take place.3. Transfer to other plants of the recombinant bacterium by mechanicaltransfer, e.g., by cutting tools, will be minimized in the field test designand field test protocol which include buffer zones and tool disinfestation.In addition, regular monitoring for the recombinant bacterium will ensurethat if it spreads to plants at the edge of the test plot it will be detected.4. Dissemination of <T3>C. xyli</T3> subsp. <T3>cynodontis</T3> can occur in seed, so all seed not used for researchpurposes (in containment) will be destroyed, preventing transfer by thismechanism.5. Data have been provided by the company to demonstrate that the probabilityof transfer of the delta-endotoxin gene from the recombinant bacteriumto other microorganisms is extremely remote.6. The recombinant bacterium has a relatively low order of toxicity tosusceptible insects. The field test plots are very small. Therefore, theintroduction of the recombinant bacterium poses no significant impact oninsect populations.7. No threatened or endangered insect species are present in Maryland,so the introduction of the recombinant bacterium poses no threat to theseinsects.8. The inherent properties of <T3>C. xyli</T3> subsp. <T3>cynodontis</T3> and the recombinant bacterium indicate that there areno human health risks. The recombinant bacterium does not grow at humanbody temperature. This bacterium has been demonstrated not to be pathogenicor toxic in mammalian tests. In addition, all crops will be used for researchpurposes or destroyed so there will be no dietary exposure to humans.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 6th day of July 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
