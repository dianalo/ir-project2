The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., whoseown state lies across an earthquake fault, was adopted on voicevote without debate. It now goes to the House.   It increases the authorization for earthquake hazard programsfrom the present $85 million to $105 million and expands themission of agencies responsible for increasing earthquakepreparedness.   For example, the bill directs the preparation of model buildingcodes to make structures more resistant to quakes and expandseducation and training programs.   It also directs the U.S. Geological Survey to do further work onthe exact location of fault lines and to establish a center for theinternational exchange of earthquake information.   Of the additional $20 million authorization, $8 million would beused for a study to determine why some buildings withstood lastweek's earthquake in San Francisco while others did not. Theremaining $12 million would be used for earthquake preparedness.   The actual $20 million is contained in the earthquake reliefprovisions of the stopgap appropriations bill sent to PresidentBush by the House earlier Wednesday. Under the rules of Congress,every appropriation must be accompanied by an authorization billthat sets a spending ceiling.</TEXT></DOC>
