On October 14, 1988, the FAA publisheda final rule which revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirementsfor conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule:(a) establishes a single-class TCA; (b) requires the pilot-in-command ofa civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilotcertificate, except for a student pilot who has received certain documentedtraining; and (c) eliminates the helicopter exception from the minimumnavigational equipment requirement. The FAA published a final rule on June 21, 1988, which requires Mode Cequipment when operating within 30 miles of any designated TCA primaryairport from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL, except for operations by certainaircraft types specifically excluded (53 FR 23356). On February 3, 1987, the FAA published a final rule which established requirementspertaining to the use, installation, inspection, and testing of Air TrafficControl Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) and Mode S transponders in U.S.-registeredcivil aircraft (53 FR 3380). The rule adopted continues to require a transponderfor operation in each TCA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The TCA program was developed to reduce the midair collision potentialin the congested airspace surrounding an airport with high density airtraffic by providing an area in which all aircraft will be subject to certainoperation rules and equipment requirements. The density of traffic and the type of operation being conducted in theairspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midaircollisions An extensive study in 1970 found that the majority of midaircollisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft and eitheran air carrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factorcommon to these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operatingunder visual flight rules (VFR) and controlled aircraft operating underinstrument flight rules (IFR). TCA's provide a method to accommodate theincreasing number of IFR and VFR operations. The regulatory requirementsof TCA airspace afford the greatest protection for the greatest numberof people by providing ATC with an increased capability to provide aircraftseparation service, thereby minimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolledaircraft. To date, the FAA has established a total of 23 TCA's. The FAA is proposingto take action to modify or implement the application of these proven controltechniques to more airports to provide greater protection of air trafficin the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft.On August 22, 1987, the Secretary of Transportation announced nine locationsfor which the FAA would issue NPRM's proposing establishment of TCA's.The nine candidates cited qualify for TCA status by meeting the criteriapublished in FAA Handbook 7400.2, ``Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters.''The criteria for establishing a TCA are based on factors which includethe number of aircraft and people using that airspace, the traffic density,and the type or nature of operations being conducted. Accordingly, guidelineshave been established to identify TCA locations based on two basic elements_thenumber of enplaned passengers and the number of aircraft operations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Pre-NPRM Public Input </ITAG>Airspace Meetings A pre-NPRM airspace meeting was held on October 4, 1988, to allow localaviation interests and airspace users an opportunity to present input onthe design of the proposed Memphis TCA. During the course of this meeting,there were presentations from Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), two localuser groups (Memphis Area TCA Ad Hoc Users' Committee and Memphis SoaringSociety), Northwest Airlines, private pilots, and concerned citizens. TheFAA also accepted written comments as well. At the meeting, ALPA centered their concerns on ensuring turbojet containmentwithin the TCA. An earlier TCA design of September 29, 1988, failed toaddress the requirements for a failed engine at maximum takeoff gross weightfor the DC-9 twin jet. The largest passenger air carrier in Memphis, NorthwestAirlines, has the largest DC-9 fleet in the world, approximately 50 percentof which are twin jets. ALPA also expressed a need for additional fullyqualified controllers and equipment to provide the services required. The Memphis Area TCA Ad Hoc Users' Committee presented its design for theproposed Memphis TCA. The boundaries of this proposal were based on radialsand distance measuring equipment from the Memphis very high frequency omni-directionalradio range and tactical air navigational aid (VORTAC). The boundariesof the TCA Ad Hoc Committee's design were relatively the same as the FAAwith the exception of the western boundary for Area B. The TCA Ad Hoc Committeesuggested a 10-mile radius of the VORTAC; the FAA's proposal is an 11-mileradius of the VORTAC. The lateral limits of the TCA Ad Hoc Committee'sproposal extend to 30 miles, with vertical limits of 10,000 feet MSL. The majority of private pilots' comments supported the concept of ``Climband Descent Corridors'' and were opposed to the Mode C rule (Notice No.88-2). The climb and descent corridors concept would keep jets in a narrowarea and at high altitudes until necessary to descend. The FAA evaluated all the comments and designs received on this proposalA common recommendation was to test the ``Climb and Descent Corridors''concept in the Memphis area. Previous tests of this concept did not providethe desired degree of safety nor the most efficient use of the airspaceprovided by the TCA configuration in a high density terminal area.Another issue mentioned was adequate staffing and equipment to providethe services required. We are confident that the staffing and equipmentare more than adequate to handle the additional workload that may be generatedby the establishment of the TCA. The use of radial and distance measuring equipment from the Memphis VORTACsuggested by the TCA Ad Hoc Users' Committee was incorporated into thisproposal. The western boundary of Area B remained an 11-mile radius ofthe Memphis VORTAC to accommodate parallel approaches. Another issue mentioned was containment of DC-9 twin jets during a failedengine at maximum takeoff gross weight. This issue is not germane to theestablishment or design configuration of a TCA. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposal </ITAG>The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish a TCA at Memphis InternationalAirport, TN. Annual enplaned passengers at Memphis International Airportare well above the 3.5 million necessary for consideration as a TCA candidateThe total airport operation count at Memphis International Airport is 384,049of which 58 percent is air carrier. This exceeds the criteria necessaryfor establishment of a TCA. Additionally, within the proposed boundaries,more than 400,000 flight operations are conducted annually. Consequently,the FAA has determined that establishment of a TCA at Memphis InternationalAirport is in the interest of flight safety and will result in a greaterdegree of protection for the greatest number of people during flight inthat terminal area. Memphis International Airport is currently served byan ARSA, which would be rescinded concurrent with the establishment ofthis TCA. The proposed location is depicted on the attached chart. Section 91.90 of Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part91) defines TCA's and prescribes operating rules for aircraft in airspacedesignated as a TCA. The TCA rule provides, in part, that prior to enteringthe TCA, any aircraft arriving at any airport within the TCA or flyingthrough a TCA must: (1) Obtain appropriate authorization from ATC; (2)unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all large turbine engine-powered aircraftoperating to or from a primary airport shall operate above the designatedfloors of the TCA; (3) comply with any procedures established by ATC forsuch operations as pilot training at an airport within a TCA; (4) holdat least a private pilot certificate; (5) meet the requirements of andSection;61.95 if the aircraft is operated by a student pilot; (6) have an operableVOR or TACAN receiver; (7) have an operable two-way radio capable of communicationswith ATC on appropriate frequencies for that TCA; and (8) be equipped withthe applicable operating transponder and automatic altitude reporting equipmentspecified in paragraph (a) of andSection; 91.24, except as provided in paragraph(d) of that section. Any aircraft departing from an airport located insidethe TCA is required to receive a clearance from ATC prior to takeoff. All aircraft operating within a TCA are required to comply with all ATCclearances and instructions and any FAA arrival or departure traffic patternfor the airport of intended operation. However, the rule permits ATC toauthorize deviations from any of the operating requirements of the rulewhen safety considerations justify the deviation or more efficient utilizationof the airspace can be attained. Ultralight vehicle operations and parachutejumps in a TCA may only be conducted under the terms of an ATC authorization.Definitions, operating requirements, and specific airspace designationsapplicable to TCA's may be found in Sections 71.12, 71.401, and 71.403of Part 71 (14 CFR Part 71) and Sections 91.1 and 91.90 of Part 91 (14CFR Part 91). The standard configuration of a TCA consists of three concentric circlescentered on the primary airport extending to 10, 20, and 30 miles respectively.The vertical limits of the TCA are 12,500 feet above MSL, with the floorestablished at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriateto containment of operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteriamay be authorized contingent upon terrain, adjacent regulatory airspace,and factors unique to the terminal area. The airspace configuration containedherein is the result of an extensive staff study conducted by the localFAA authority after obtaining public input from informal airspace meetingsand coordinating with the FAA regional office. The FAA has determined thefollowing proposed TCA airspace configuration is consistent with TCA objectivesand allows consideration of terminal area flight operations and terrain:1. That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including 10,000feet MSL within a 7-mile radius of the primary airport extending clockwisefrom the Memphis VORTAC 075anddegrees; radial to the Memphis VORTAC 275anddegrees;radial and within a 5-mile radius of the primary airport extending clockwisefrom the Memphis VORTAC 275anddegrees; radial to the Memphis VORTAC 075anddegrees;radial. This airspace is necessary to contain large turbine-powered aircraftwithin the confines of the TCA while operating to and from the primaryairport and allow for ingress/egress to secondary airports without affectingthe primary airport 2. That airspace extending upward from 1,800 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL within the area bounded by a line beginning at a point13 miles northeast of the primary airport on the Memphis VORTAC 037anddegrees;radial extending southward to the Memphis VORTAC 052anddegrees; radial 10-milefix, extending to the point where it intercepts the 10-mile radius of theprimary airport; thence clockwise along the 10-mile radius of the primaryairport until the interception of a line from the Memphis VORTAC 128anddegrees;radial 10-mile fix extending south to the Memphis VORTAC 148anddegrees; radial15-mile fix to the point where it intercepts the 15-mile radius of theprimary airport; thence clockwise along the 15-mile radius of the primaryairport to the interception  of a line from the Memphis VORTAC 211anddegrees;radial 15-mile fix extending northward to the Memphis VORTAC 224anddegrees;radial 11-mile fix to the point where it intercepts the 11-mile radiusof the primary airport; thence clockwise along the 11-mile radius of theprimary airport to the interception of a line from the Memphis VORTAC 316anddegrees;radial 11-mile fix extending northward to the Memphis VORTAC 324anddegrees;radial 13-mile fix; thence clockwise along the 13-mile radius of the primaryairport to the point of beginning and excluding that airspace within Paragraph1. This configuration is necessary to maximize parallel approach capabilities.3. That airspace extending upward from 3,000 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL within a 20-mile radius of the primary airport, excludingthat airspace within Paragraphs 1 and 2. This airspace is needed to allowsufficient airspace for departures and inbound mixing of aircraft.4. That airspace extending upward from 5,000 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL within a 30-mile radius of the primary airport, excludingthat airspace northwest of a line from the Memphis VORTAC 296anddegrees;radial to the Memphis VORTAC 355anddegrees; radial, excluding that airspacesoutheast of a line from the Memphis VORTAC 115anddegrees; radial to theMemphis VORTAC 145anddegrees; radial and excluding that airspace within Paragraphsl, 2, and 3. This airspace configuration would provide an area to containaircraft during climb and descent profiles to transition between the terminaland en route structure and allow VFR aircraft to circumnavigate the TCAon the north and south bypass airways. The preceding general summary of the proposed TCA airspace configurationidentifies that airspace which is necessary to contain large turbojet aircraftoperations at Memphis International Airport. ATC will provide control andseparation of all flights within the proposed airspace boundaries. Furthermore,ATC authorization is requisite to aircraft operations within that airspace.Establishment of this TCA will greatly enhance the safety of flight withinthe congested airspace overlying the Memphis metropolitan area by facilitatingthe separation of controlled and uncontrolled flight operations. Section71.403 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished inHandbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary </ITAG>The FAA is required to assess the benefits and costs of each proposed rulemakingaction to assure that the public is not burdened with rules having costswhich outweigh their benefits. This section contains an analysis whichquantifies, to the maximum possible extent, the costs and benefits of establishinga TCA at Memphis, TN. This regulatory evaluation summary should be readin conjunction with the NPRM since it provides additional background information.This proposal is intended to lower the likelihood of midair collisionsby increasing the capability of the ATC system to separate all aircraftin terminal airspace around the Memphis International Airport. This actionwas prompted by data indicating that a high percentage of near midair collisionsreported to the FAA in terminal areas involve VFR aircraft that are notrequired to be under the control of ATC. Thus, the overall objective ofthis proposal is to substantially increase safety while accommodating thelegitimate concerns of airspace users. Costs-Benefits Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Costs </ITAG>The FAA estimates the total cost expected to accrue from implementationof the proposed rule to be $4.9 million ($2.7 million, discounted, 15 years)in 1987 dollars. Approximately $2.3 million (discounted) or 84 percentof the total estimated oosts would be incurred by the FAA primarily foradditional personnel. The remaining costs would be incurred by small GAaircraft operators who would be required under this proposal to equip theiraircraft with Mode C transponders sooner than they would have for the ARSAunder the previous FAA rule: ``Transponder With Automatic Altitude ReportingCapability Requirement (Mode C)'' (53 FR 23356, June 21, 1988). This rulebecame effective June 21. 1988, and will be implemented in two phases.Phase I, to begin in July 1989, will require a transponder with Mode Cat and above 10,000 feet MSL and in the vicinity (30 nautical miles) ofTCA primary airports. There are currently 23 TCA's. Phase II will implement a transponder with Mode C requirement in the airspacein the vicinity (10 nautical miles) of ARSA primary airports. Phase IIbecomes effective on December 30, 1990, and will affect over 135 ARSA's.Also in Phase II, a transponder with Mode C will be required at other designatedairports for which either a TCA or ARSA has not been adopted. Consequently,most aircraft without Mode C transponders would need ATC authorizationto fly within 30 nautical miles of a primary TCA airport, within 10 nauticalmiles of a primary ARSA airport, or within controlled airspace of otherdesignated airports that would also require Mode C transponders. Thus, this evaluation, as well as the Mode C rule, assumes that all aircraftwithout Mode C would acquire such equipment rather than circumnavigatethe subject airport. The only aircraft without this equipment would benonelectrical and antique types. Costs to these types of aircraft operatorshave already been accounted for by the Mode C rule. As a result, aircraftoperators impacted by this proposal would only incur the opportunity costof capital by requiring them to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transpondersone year earlier than they would be required to do so in accordance withPhase II of the Mode C rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Benefits </ITAG>This proposed rule is expected to generate potential benefits primarilyin the form of enhanced safety to the aviation community and the flyingpublic. Such safety, for instance, would take the form of reduced casualtylosses (namely, aviation fatalities and property damage) resulting froma lowered likelihood of midair collisions because of increased positivecontrol in airspace to be established by the TCA. In addition, potentialbenefits are expected to accrue in the form of improved operational efficiencyon the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Ordinarily, the potential benefits of this proposal would be the reductionin the probability of midair collisions resulting from converting the existingARSA to a TCA. However, because of the recent Mode C rule (and to someextent, the rule for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance (TCAS), 54 FR940, January 10, 1989), the number of potential midair collisions avoidedby this proposal is expected to be significantly lower. Nevertheless, thisproposal is still expected to accrue benefits in terms of enhanced safety,though on a much smaller scale. This point can be illustrated with the use of statistical models basedon actual and projected critical near midair collision (NMAC) incidentsin lieu of actual midair collisions. (A critical NMAC is an event involvingtwo aircraft coming within 100 feet of each other; the fact that they donot collide is not due to an action on the part of either pilot, but, rather,is due purely to chance.) Since midair collisions involving Part 135 aircraftand especially Part 121 aircraft are rare, the use of critical NMAC's willserve to illustrate, to some degree, the potential improvements in aviationsafety of implementing this proposal.Simple regression analyses were prepared for this evaluation which focusedon critical NMAC's and aircraft operations in the 23 existing TCA's andin a random sample of 23 of the existing 79 ARSA's (as of 1986 and 1987).The results of these analyses indicated that TCA's have approximately 68percent fewer critical NMAC's annually, on average, than ARSA's. Whilethere is no demonstrated relationship between NMAC's and actual midaircollisions, the lower NMAC rate does indicate a more efficient separationof aircraft in congested airspace. As the result of these findings, if the existing Memphis ARSA were to remainunchanged (and the recent Mode C and TCAS rules were not in effect), theMemphis Terminal Area would be expected to experience approximately 2.2critical NMAC's annually (or 34 critical NMAC's over the next 15 years).If, however, the ARSA were to become a TCA, this figure would reduce toapproximately 0.7 critical NMAC's annually (or 11 critical NMAC's overthe next 15 years). Thus, over the next 15 years, this proposal could resultin the reduction of approximately 23 critical NMAC's. However, it is importantto note that many, if not most, of these potential critical NMAC's wouldnever materialize as predicted primarily because of the ``Mode C'' ruleas it is applied to the Memphis ARSA and, to some extent, the ``TCAS''rule. According to Phase II of the Mode C rule, all aircraft operating within10 nautical miles (except for flights under the outer 5-mile ``shelf'')of an ARSA primary airport must be equipped with a Mode C Transponder.Phase I of the Mode C rule requires, as of July 1989, aircraft operatingwithin 30 nautical miles of a TCA to be equipped with a Mode C transponderThese requirements are expected to significantly reduce the risk of midaircollisions in ARSA's and TCA's. For this reason, the primary safety benefitof this proposal to create a TCA in 1989 at Memphis is that the safetyenhancements of the Mode C and TCAS requirements will occur one year earlierthan they otherwise would be expected without this proposal. A second safetybenefit would be in terms of the lowered likelihood of midair collisionsas the result of expanding the lateral boundaries of positive ATC by 20nautical miles through replacing the Memphis ARSA with a TCA. Thus, the safety benefits of the establishment of a new TCA, while positive,would be less than would otherwise accrue in the absence of the Mode Cand TCAS rules. Since this proposal essentially extends the effects ofthe Mode C rule, virtually all of its potential safety benefits are assumedto be part of that rule. Such benefits cannot be estimated separately and,therefore, are considered to be inextricably linked primarily to the ModeC rule. Over a 15-year period, the Mode C rule is expected to generatetotal potential safety benefits of $344 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars).(The Mode C rule benefits estimate of $310 million for 10 years has beenadjusted to a 15 year period for the purpose of comparability with theTCAS rule and other FAA rulemaking actions). It is important to note thatpart of these safety benefits would be attributed to the TCAS rule. Thus,the potential safety benefits of this proposal, and the Mods C and TCASrules are considered to be inextricably linked. Another potential benefit of the proposed rule would be improved operationalefficiency on the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Under the proposedrule, Mode C transponder requirements would ease controller workload peraircraft being controlled because of the reduction in radio communications.The proposed rule would also make potential traffic conflicts more readilyapparent to the controller. As the result of improved operational efficiency,the impact of the controller workload increased by separation requirementsin the proposed TCA would be somewhat offset because of the controller'sability to adjust the volume of VFR traffic in any given portion of theTCA. Improved operational efficiency should generate other types of benefitsin the form of significant reductions in the number of VFR aircraft requestsdenied and VFR aircraft delayed during busy periods. As the result of convertingthe existing Memphis ARSA to a TCA, the improved operational efficiencywould accrue because of the availability of additional air traffic controllers.If the Memphis ARSA were to remain intact, such air traffic personnel wouldnot be required. Therefore, potential benefits of improved operationalefficiency, which are not considered to be quantifiable in monetary termsin this evaluation, would be attributed to this proposal rather than eitherthe Mode C rule or TCAS rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Comparison of Benefits and Costs </ITAG>The total cost that would accrue from implementation of the proposed ruleis estimated to be $2.7 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars). Approximately,16 percent of this total cost estimate would fall on those GA aircraftoperators without Mode C transponders in the form of opportunity costsby requiring them to acquire such avionics equipment, including maintenance,one year sooner than they otherwise would under the status quo. The typicalindividual GA aircraft operator impacted would incur an estimated one-timecost ranging from $86 to $191 (discounted) under the proposed rule. (Asthe result of the opportunity cost concept, the derivation of these costestimates are too complex to discuss briefly. Therefore, the reader shouldrefer to the detailed regulatory evaluation, which is contained in thedocket, for a full  explanation of the method by which these costs estimateswere made.) The potential benefits of the proposed rule would be the lowered likelihoodof midair collisions from the conversion of the existing ARSA to a TCA.The number of midair collisions avoided and their respective monetary valuescannot be estimated for this proposal independent of the Mode C and TCASrules, but the FAA believes the risk would be substantially reduced. AnFAA analysis prepared for this evaluation, however, has shown that criticalnear midair collisions occur approximately two-thirds less frequently ina TCA than within an ARSA. The FAA believes that even after the aviationcommunity complies with the Mode C and TCAS rules, locations convertingfrom ARSA's to TCA's would continue to experiance reduced critical NMAC's.In addition, the proposed rule would generate improved operational efficiencybenefits on the part of FAA air traffic controllers, though they are notconsidered to be quantifiable in monetary terms. Clearly, in view of the cost of compliance relative to the significantreduction in the likelihood of midair collisions as well as improved operationalefficiency in the Memphis Terminal Area, the FAA firmly believes the proposedrule is cost-beneficial. The Regulatory Evaluation that has been placed in the docket contains additionaldetailed information related to the costs and benefits that are expectedto accrue from the implementation of this NPRM. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure thatsmall entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened byGovernment regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules whichmay have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.'' The small entities which could be potentially affected by the implementationof this proposed rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire whoown nine or fewer aircraft. Virtually all of the aircraft operators impacted by this proposed rulewould be those who acquire Mode C transponder capability The FAA believesthat all unscheduled aircraft operators (namely, air taxi operators) potentiallyimpacted by this proposed rule already have Mode C transponders due tothe fact that such operators fly regularly in or near airports where radarapproach control service has been established. Even if some of these operatorswere to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transponders, the cost wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of them.The annual FAA threshold for significant economic impact is $3,700 (1987dollars) for a small entity. According to FAA Order 2100.14A (RegulatoryFlexibility Criteria and Guidance), the definition of a small entity, interms of an air taxi operator, is one with nine aircraft owned, but notnecessarily operated. If we were to assume that a particular aircraft operator had nine aircraftwithout transponders, then the annual one-time cost per impacted aircraftwould be approximately $210 (undiscounted, for the purpose of comparabilitywith the figure of $3,700). The total annual one-time cost per small entitywould amount to an estimated $1,890. Thus, the annual worst case cost fora small entity would fall far below the FAA's annual threshold of $3,700.Therefore, the FAA believes this proposed rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Assessment </ITAG>The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviationproducts or services in the United States, nor would it have an effecton the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This isbecause the proposed rule would only potentially impact small GA aircraftoperators without Mode C, and not aircraft manufacturers. The average costof acquiring Mode G capability is estimated to range from $900 (to upgradefrom a Mode A transponder) to $2,000 (to acquire a Mode C transponder withouthaving a Mode A transponder). The cost of acquiring Mode C capability isnot considered to be high enough to discourage potential buyers of smallGA airplanes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>This regulation would not have substantial direct effects on the states,on the relationship between the national government and the states, oron the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof a Federalism assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed under ``Regulatory Evaluation,'' the FAA hasdetermined that this proposed regulation is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291. This rulemaking is considered a ``significant rule''under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979).
