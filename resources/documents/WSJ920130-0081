Departing from his approach of previous years, when hefocused primarily on short-term savings and resistedwholesale cuts in military hardware, Mr. Bush in his fiscal1993 budget targets several of the most cherished andexpensive weapons the Pentagon has on the drawing board oralready rolling off assembly lines. These include Cold Warweapons systems ranging from the Air Force's B-2 Stealthbomber and the Navy's super-quiet Seawolf submarine to theArmy's next-generation tanks and helicopters.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to proposing a long list of specific programdelays and cancellations for the fiscal year beginning Oct.1, Mr. Bush's spending blueprint emphasizes research,prolonged testing of prototypes, and a low rate of newpurchases for advanced weaponry. The new approach, promisingfundamental changes in how the Pentagon and the defenseindustry will work together, will put manufacturing decisionson hold in order to minimize technical, financial and otherrisks.   By seeking to cut overall defense spending authority to$280.9 billion from $283.8 billion currently, Mr. Bush hopesto convince Congress that the administration has embarked onan aggressive strategy to bring Pentagon expenditures in linewith profound changes in the world and revised domesticspending priorities. Actual Pentagon outlays for the fiscalyear would be about $5.2 billion less than allowed under the1990 deficit-reduction agreement. And over the next sixyears, expenditures would be cut an additional $42 billionbelow spending plans the administration submitted to Congressonly last year. The overall budget figure includes funds tobe spent by the Energy Department to produce nuclear weaponsand to clean up nuclear facilities.   Lawmakers are certain to push for deeper personnelreductions, and more sweeping procurement cutbacks, than thepresident favors. Some members of Congress seek four or fivetimes the savings Mr. Bush's plan envisions over the nextfive years. In an election year with the economy faltering,congressional leaders also are likely to dismiss Mr. Bush'srequest to avoid spending more than $7 billion previouslyappropriated for reserve units, the National Guard andvarious politically popular weapons projects.   Emphasizing the administration's determination to stick toits defense strategy, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney toldreporters the U.S. can't afford deeper manpower cuts but can&quot;proceed with modernization at a more deliberate pace.&quot; Theadministration, Mr. Cheney said, doesn't intend &quot;to changethat plan every six months or 12 months based on changes inCapitol Hill or overseas.&quot; Using similar, tough rhetoric,Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said: &quot;Itwould be very, very imprudent to start pulling numbers out ofthe air.&quot;   Based on an average 4% annual decline in Pentagon spendingafter inflation, Mr. Bush projects defense expendituresshrinking to 16% of overall federal outlays by1997-comparable with its share of federal spending in theearly 1960s. Defense currently accounts for about 20% offederal spending.   Congressional critics accused the White House of failingto define clearly the rationale for its proposed cuts. &quot;Weought to know why we're spending for defense, as well as whywe're cutting,&quot; said Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman ofthe House Armed Services Committee. Calling scaled-back B-2production a big mistake, Senate Armed Services Committeechairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) told reporters that some of Mr.Bush's cuts &quot;reflected public opinion polls&quot; rather than &quot;oursecurity needs.&quot; The administration's package, Sen. Nunnsaid, &quot;has to have a lot more analysis and logic behind it&quot;to avoid &quot;a bidding war&quot; over defense cuts.   On top of the big-ticket programs targeted by Mr. Bush,more than a dozen other smaller ones would be terminated --including E-2C early warning aircraft, anti-submarinecomputers and other Navy programs. The Navy, in fact, mayface the most long-term budget uncertainty of any of theservices. &quot;We may have to go back to the drawing board aboutwhat kind of nuclear Navy&quot; the country wants, SecretaryCheney said.   The president's proposal calls for Pentagon procurementauthority to sink to $54.4 billion, 7% less than currentlevels.   His proposed anti-missile defense system, a scaled-downversion of the Reagan-era &quot;Star Wars&quot; initiative, is the onlybig-ticket weapons program that would receive a significantbudget increase. The Air Force would be the only militaryservice enjoying a budget increase; its spending would climbto nearly $84 billion in budget authority from $80.2 billioncurrently. That increase largely reflects hefty proposedspending on research and space programs, the cost ofcompleting radar-evading B-2s for which parts already havebeen purchased, and continued work on the F-22 AdvancedTactical Fighter.   For the most part, the administration's package envisionsimproving and stretching out the life of existing weaponsrather than trying to field replacements before the end ofthe decade. Many details of the plan weren't disclosed by thePentagon, though, reflecting the last-minute nature of theadministration's budget deliberations this year.   The go-slow procurement policy for new weapons means thatcontractors, instead of betting on production to provideprofits, must be assured of heftier returns during the earlystages of projects. Hoping to reassure the industry,Secretary Cheney said that production -- albeit at a low rate-- will be the goal in many cases. &quot;We're not talking aboutbuilding one or two items and putting them on the shelf,&quot; hesaid.   Proposed nuclear-related reductions -- including stoppingdevelopment of the single-warhead Midgetman missile andhalting production of new warheads for submarine-launchedTrident II missiles -- would save some $20 billion over sixyears.   Further, provided the Russians agree to deep nuclear cutsof their own, Mr. Bush is prepared to cut the number of U.S.long-range nuclear warheads to half the levels planned asrecently as this past fall. Certain classes of land-basedmissiles would be scrapped. The number of sea-based warheadsalso would be reduced, and dozens of B-52 and B-1 bomberswould be converted to non-nuclear missions.   In a report released along with budget documents, theJoint Chiefs of Staff acknowledge that the Soviet Union'sdemise has forever changed &quot;the concept of threat analysis&quot;inside the Pentagon. The report says that only North Korea, aweakened Iraq and one or two other countries can serve as thebenchmark for shaping the eventual size of U.S. forces&quot;without straining credulity.&quot;   According to the report, it will become increasinglyimportant for the U.S. to be able to move troops andequipment quickly to cope with Third World and regionalcrises. That's why C-17 cargo plane production would remain apriority, and why the Pentagon wants to spend $2.9 billion toenhance sea-lift capabilities. The report also stresses theimportance of the military participating in anti-drugefforts, providing humanitarian assistance and defendingagainst international terrorists.   On the personnel side, Mr. Bush calls for slightly fasterreductions in active-duty uniformed and civilian payrollsthan he sought in previous years. The current timetable callsfor cutting active-duty forces to just above 1.6 million byfiscal 1995. But two years later, when the force reductionsare proposed to end, the U.S. active-duty force still wouldbottom out 25% below its post-Vietnam peak of 2.1 million.And despite Congress's unwillingness so far to cut deeplyinto National Guard and reserve forces, Mr. Bush continues toask for such savings.   The budget, as Mr. Bush and Secretary Cheney pledged,largely would keep intact maintenance and training accounts.Overall spending on research and development is proposed torise nearly 2% after inflation to $38.8 billion from $36.9billion.   Budget authority represents the total amount committed forcertain programs, but it can be spent over several years.   Here are the highlights of the military budget proposed byMr. Bush:   B-2 STEALTH BOMBER: By capping at 20 the number of thebombers built by Northrop Corp., the administration expectsto save $600 million in the next fiscal year and $14.5billion over the next six years compared with its earlierplans. But even if Congress agrees to bring the fleet to thatlevel -- by providing funds for the final four planes forwhich some parts have been purchased -- the cost ofdeveloping, producing and fielding each aircraft will exceed$2 billion. The Air Force, which has budgeted $200 million ayear to refine stealth technology, plans to equip thescaled-down B-2 fleet to carry nuclear or conventionalweapons.   SUBMARINES: The administration hopes to save a total of$17.5 billion through fiscal 1997 by halting production ofadditional nuclear-powered Seawolf submarines. The projectedsavings include some $3.4 billion that was appropriated byCongress in previous years. The first Seawolf is being builtby a General Dynamics Corp. unit.   STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE: The Pentagon wants a $1.3billion increase for SDI research to $5.4 billion. Theadministration is eager to deploy a limited, ground-basedmissile defense system by the late 1990s. But the proposalwill run into stiff congressional opposition, partly becausea portion of the extra funds would be earmarked fordeveloping controversial space-based interceptors.   LH HELICOPTER: The plan calls for saving a total of $3.4billion by stretching out development of the Army'snext-generation chopper and concentrating on developingenhanced prototypes, while upgrading the service's currentfleet of helicopters. Long considered the Army's top-priorityacquisition program, the so-called Comanche scout helicopteris being developed by a team of Boeing Co. and McDonnellDouglas Corp. units.   TANKS: As expected, the budget proposes to defer untilafter 1997 spending to develop the next-generation tank forthe Army. And Mr. Bush wants to save a total of almost $3billion by scrapping a major Army air-defense program, whileextending development and postponing procurement of theservice's next line-of-sight antitank missile.   MISSILES: The budget seeks to limit production of the AirForce's radar-evading Advanced Cruise Missile to 640missiles, instead of the 1,000 originally planned. GeneralDynamics and McDonnell Douglas share work on the program.</TEXT></DOC>
