Camp</HEAD><BYLINE>By ANUDEE SIASAKUL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of Khmer Rouge refugees livingon the Thai-Cambodian border have fled heavy artillery attacks andentered a U.N.- controlled camp, relief officials said Monday.   In the past week, about 10,000 Khmer Rouge refugees have moved tothe new Site K camp on Thailand's eastern frontier southwest ofBangkok, to join about 3,000 others who have lived there since June,said a relief official, who asked not to be identified.   Officials said they believe the new arrivals have come from PhumThmei, one of many military camps under Khmer Rouge control alongthe Thai-Cambodian border. Phum Thmei has reportedly suffered heavyshelling from Cambodia, which is backed by Vietnamese forces.   Last week, relief officials said they were encouraged by whatappeared to be a gradual improvement in recent months in therelationship between Khmer Rouge and international humanitarianorganizations.   Diplomats, relief workers and international human rights agencieshave accused the Khmer Rouge of human rights abuses against thecivilian population under their control.   Some officials speculate that by allowing the refugees to moveinto U.N.-assisted areas, the Khmer Rouge may be trying to present abetter image in advance of an international conference on Cambodiain Paris next month.   The Vietnamese government has promised to pull its troops out bythe end of September and the conference is expected to discussformation of an interim Cambodian government.   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people during its3{-year rule after 1975. They have fought a guerrilla war from basesalong the Thai frontier since being ousted by the Vietnameseinvasion of Cambodia in 1978.   Relief workers say that 50,000 Khmer Rouge civilians live incamps supervised by the U.N. Border Relief Operation. But the numberliving in secret military bases outside U.N. control could be twicethat large, they said.   Farther north from Phum Thmei, the population of another KhmerRouge refugee camp along the border at O'trao has swollen to over10,000 due to new arrivals from military camps, relief officialssaid.   Khmer Rouge officials have permitted medical teams to vaccinate8,000 people in two military camps near the U.N.-administered Site 8camp, they said.   In mid-April about 700 Cambodians left the secretive Khmer Rougecamp of Kaiche after it was heavily shelled and traveled a few milesto Sok Sann camp, run by the non-communist guerrillas of the KhmerPeople's National Liberation Front.</TEXT></DOC>
