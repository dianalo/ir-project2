KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate on Tuesday revived attempts toimpose punitive sanctions against Iraq for its alleged use ofpoison gas against Kurdish civilians but eliminated sanctionssenators said would harm U.S. farm exporters.   The 87-0 roll call vote by which the sanctions measure wasadopted was the third time the Senate has voted on the issue sincepoison gas attacks by the Iraqi army were reported in late August.   The Senate's third attempt to deal with the poison gas issuecame on a bill far less sweeping than sanctions legislationoriginally adopted early in September. The new Senate bill closelyfollows the line of legislation adopted by the House and representsa compromise with three House committees.   It would impose two sanctions immediately. They are:   _ A ban on the export of munitions and certain high technologyitems.   _ A requirement that the United States oppose loans to Iraq byinternational financial institutions such as the World Bank.   The bill requires President Reagan to impose additionalsanctions by the end of the year if Iraq does not stop the use ofchemical weapons and provide verifiable assurances it will notagain use them.   The president is required to choose from a list of potentialsanctions that include denying export-import credits, restrictingimports from Iraq, expanding restrictions on exports to Iraq anddowngrading of diplomatic relations.   Contracts entered into prior to the imposition of sanctionswould be protected.   Responding to the demands of senators representing farmersproducing such crops as rice or wheat, the legislation imposes nolimitation on agricultural exports to Iraq or the provision ofcredit or credit guarantees for agricultural purchases.   ``The concern is that this not lead to an embargo onagricultural exports to Iraq,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., saying sanctions are fully justifiedby ``the horrifying acts of the Iraqi government to systematicallyeliminate its own citizens.''   ``The world cannot stand by in the face of repeated use ofpoison gas by Iraq,'' said Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.   But Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., complained that the measure unfairlypenalized U.S. manufacturers.   ``Unilateral controls on U.S. agriculture do not work and theydon't work on medical equipment, personal computers or machinetools,'' Heinz said, adding that Iraq would turn to other suppliersif U.S. exports of those products were cut off.   ``They're probably laughing at us in Iraq right now,'' Heinzsaid, declaring that the bill would not cut off the export to Iraqof the equipment and chemicals needed to produce such chemicalweapons as mustard gas and nerve gas.   ``It shoots American exporters in the foot and does not get tothe root of the problem,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
