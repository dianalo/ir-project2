Gorbachev and his squabblingEast bloc allies today opened a Warsaw Pact summit that is expectedto bring more arms control initiatives.   The publicity-conscious Soviet president was tight-lipped abouthis expectations for the two-day meeting in the Romanian capital.Asked by reporters what he expected, Gorbachev said only: ``I'lltell you after we finish.''   Gorbachev is attending the meeting with Soviet Premier NikolaiRyzhkov and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Romanianofficials said reporters would be allowed no access to them and theother Soviet bloc leaders during the closed-door meetings.   Gorbachev arrived in Bucharest late Thursday from Strasbourg,France, where he announced that Moscow and its allies could agree onunilateral cuts in Soviet short-range nuclear missiles in EasternEurope if NATO is prepared to negotiate reductions on those weapons.   This meeting may produce numbers for those cuts.   The Western Alliance patched up a divisive row between WestGermany and the United States over such negotiations six weeks ago.President Bush on May 29 proposed drastic reductions in conventionalforces of both military blocs in Europe.   Speaking Thursday at a news conference in Washington, Bushspurned Gorbachev's call for swift negotiations on short-rangenuclear missiles.   Bush noted that NATO leaders, at the summit in Brussels six weeksago, agreed to begin negotiations on such weapons only after anEast-West agreement had been reached to reduce conventional forcesand reductions were actually under way.   ``I don't want to get off the track by re-opening the short-rangenuclear forces package,'' he said.   West Germany was pushing for quick talks on short-range nuclearweapons but agreed to delay them until after preliminary agreementsare reached on conventional arms reductions at East-West talks inVienna.   Bonn signaled, however, it hopes agreement will come within theyear deadline proposed by Bush. Other Western nations call thatoptimistic.   Gorbachev said in Bonn last month that the Warsaw Pact summitcould deliver a detailed response to Bush's proposals to reduce thearmed forces of East and West in Europe to 275,000 on each side andagree on further cuts in weaponry and combat aircraft.   Romanian officials said the Pact will not announce a decisionuntil after the summit ends Saturday.   Romania's tightly controlled state media announced no firm agendafor the meeting.   The state news agency Agerpres announced only that EasternEuropean delegations arrived to a welcome from President NicolaeCeausescu, the East bloc's most resolute foe of Gorbachev's movestoward more democracy and market-oriented economies.   Just last week, in a speech pointedly distributed to foreignjournalists covering the summit, Ceausescu rejected any return toprivate ownership and insisted, ``We must take a firm attitudeagainst any attempts to denigrate socialism.''   ``We think that the concern with a better development ofsocialism in various countries should not bring a negation orunderrating of the might of socialism,'' he added, in a clear swipeat recent developments in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.   Political reforms in those countries have divided the oncemonolithic East bloc, with Romania most staunchly opposed to changeand East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia also still dominatedby orthodox communists.   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ameeting was expected to be held on ideology Saturday after the Pactsummit formally ends.   ``Very little is expected to come out of it,'' he said, alludingto the deep divisions within the Soviet bloc.   Ideological quarrels have exacerbated traditional nationalism andcenturies-old rivalries between the diverse ethnic groups of EasternEurope.   Neighboring Hungary and Romania are engaged in the fiercest feud,a war of words resulting from Romania's alleged mistreatment of its1.7 million-member ethnic Hungarian minority.   Hungary has also antagonized neighboring Czechoslovakia withpolitical reforms and a decision to halt work on a joint DanubeRiver dam project.   Bulgaria is isolated from its Pact allies over its treatment ofits Turkish minority, who are leaving the country by the tens ofthousands following the death of at least eight Turks in violentprotests against a Bulgarian assimilation campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
