Among the major consequences of New Zealand's unilateral antinuclearstance are the following: (1) The ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, UnitedStates) relationship is no longer operational between Washington andWellington because the United States cannot adjust to the idea of anunequivocally non-nuclear ally. (2) New Zealand's bilateral defense relationshipwith Australia has improved, and non-nuclear and nonmilitary approachesto security in the South Pacific are getting more attention. There are,in effect, now two ANZUS links - one between Australia and the UnitedStates and one between Australia and New Zealand. (3) New Zealand hasrefrained from translating its international antinuclear profile intospecific new disarmament initiatives. This may be because, as criticssuggest, advocating arms control and disarmament during the currentlystrained period of relations with the United States would be largelyineffective. (4) Although Wellington is generally unwilling to exportantinuclearism, the New Zealand antinuclear stance is serving as a modelfor other countries. US responses and actions are discussed. 4 references</TEXT></DOC>
