MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   By the year 2000, Hispanics will outnumberblacks in New York state, and 15 years later, European whites willno longer be the majority population, according to a new study.   Indeed, sometime in the first two decades, California, New Yorkand Texas will join Hawaii as states with no ethnic majority,according to the report, ``The Population and Labor Force of NewYork: 1990 to 2050,'' released Monday.   ``The rapid growth, numerically as well as proportionately,among groups who traditionally have not fared very welleducationally or economically raises the potential for a two-tieredsocial structure with non-Hispanic whites and many Asians at thetop and most blacks and Hispanics at the bottom,'' said theauthors, Leon F. Bouvier and Vernon M. Briggs Jr.   Bouvier is an adjunct professor of sociology at Old DominionUniversity in Virginia and vice president of the PopulationReference Bureau, a private think tank which published the report.Briggs is a professor of labor and industrial relations at CornellUniversity in Ithaca, N.Y.   The study's population projections for New York are higher thanthose of the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Data Center of theNew York State Department of Commerce. Those two agencies expectthe Empire State's population to reach 18.5 million by 2000, butBouvier and Briggs say it may reach 19.6 million.   The two researchers also predict that the number of New Yorkersof European descent will drop from 12.6 million in 1990 to 9.6million in 2020 and 5.2 million in 2050. Meanwhile, the blackpopulation will double, from 2.8 million now to 5.7 million in2020, dipping to 4.8 million in 2050.   If the current high levels of immigration continue, and thefertility rate among white Europeans stays the same, the number ofHispanics in New York will increase, from 2.5 million now to 5.6million in 2020, and 8.8 million in 2050, the report said.   Over the same period, the Asian population will rise from lessthan 700,000 now to more than 3.1 million in 2050, according toBouvier and Briggs.</TEXT></DOC>
