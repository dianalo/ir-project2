On Feb. 27, General Electric Co.'s National BroadcastingCo. unit signed a definitive agreement to purchase themedia-business assets of FNN for $105 million. Thelast-minute bid superseded a bid from a partnership betweenGroup W Satellite Communications and Dow Jones andamp; Co. for areported $90 million. As expected, FNN filed forbankruptcy-court protection on March 1.</LP><TEXT>   Under the provisions set by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge FrancisG. Conrad, a competing bid would have to be at least $10million over the $105 million submitted by CNBC, FNN's maincompetitor and a service of NBC Cable, and approved by theFNN board.   Judge Conrad also said if NBC ultimately didn't emergevictorious from a possible bidding war, it would be paid $2million plus 10% of any amount over $105 million. Forexample, if another suitor bid $115 million, NBC wouldreceive a total of $3 million in so-called break-up fees.These fees would be paid out of the proceeds of the sale,according to a person familiar with the provisions. Inaddition, NBC would be paid its expenses if its deal wasn'tconsummated.   The judge also ruled that any new suitor must accept theCNBC-FNN contract in its exact form.   Any new bid would have to be submitted to the bankruptcycourt by March 25 and Judge Conrad set April 3 as the hearingdate on the transaction. April 3 is also the date that finalbids would be considered.   Tom Rogers, president of NBC Cable, said: &quot;We're gratifiedby the judge's decision.&quot;   In an interview yesterday, Peter G. Skinner, senior vicepresident at Dow Jones, said the partnership is &quot;keeping allof our options open. . . . We were anxious to see NBC'scontract, which we've done, and we've said we're consideringrevising our bid.&quot;   Asked whether the Group W-Dow Jones partnership wouldsubmit a revised offer, Mr. Skinner said, &quot;It's ourexpectation we'll be involved.&quot; He declined to elaborate.   Group W Satellite Communications is a division ofWestinghouse Electric Corp. Dow Jones publishes The WallStreet Journal and Barron's magazine.   FNN, which is 47%-owned by Infotechnology Inc., isavailable to 35 million cable subscribers and CNBC isavailable to 18 million cable households. CNBC said it wouldcombine the resources of both business-oriented channels intoone channel shortly after the acquisition.   The CNBC offer was approved after a lengthy FNN boardmeeting Feb. 25, one week after an agreement in principle wasreached between FNN and the Group W-Dow Jones partnership.Now, if another bid is submitted, it is up to Judge Conrad todecide what is the best offer to satisfy FNN's creditors. FNNhas total assets of $75.5 million and total liabilities of$145.4 million, including secured debt of $49.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
