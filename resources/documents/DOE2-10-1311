Eight separate cases were studied ranging from a two phaserepository design with no MRS facility to a design in which the repositoryonly received package waste from the MRS facility for emplacement. Theaddition of the MRS facility to the Waste Management System significantlyreduced the capital cost of the salt repository. All but one of the casesstudied were capable of meeting the waste acceptance data. The reductionin the size and complexity of the Salt Repository waste handling buildingwith the integration of the MRS facility reduces the design and operatingstaff requirements. 7 refs., 35 figs., 43 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
