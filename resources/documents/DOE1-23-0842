The model predictions are comparedto published mixing tables for heavy brine completion fluids and to crystallizationtemperatures measured in the laboratory. Examples are given of how themodels have been used to formulate brine muds and to predict how muchadditional salt could be added to a produced brine mud to increase muddensity without having excess solids.</TEXT></DOC>
