Members of the Pittsburgh-based United Electrical, Radio andMachine Workers of America (UE), which claims a membership of9,400, and the Washington, D.C.-based International Union ofElectronic, Salaried Technical and Furniture Workers (IUE), whichhas about 40,000 members, will vote on the contract Wednesday andThursday, UE union spokesman Peter Gilmore said Saturday.   The unions represent GE production and maintenance workersnationwide. Their last contract expired June 30.   After meeting to discuss the proposal Friday, the UE voted torecommend acceptance rather than call for a strike because ofdisagreement among the leadership of the IUE, Gilmore said.   He said some IUE negotiators recommended acceptance of theproposal and others called for rejection. Some executive boards ofmajor IUE locals voted to approved it while others rejected it, hesaid.   ``Under the current circumstances, an effective nationwidestrike against GE is impossible,'' the union said in a writtenstatement. ``While we firmly believe the company's offer isinadequate, we cannot lead our members into a long strike that hasvirtually no chance of success because of the lack of unity.''   The agreement was reached June 26, between the company and thetwo unions, which are the largest of the 14 GE unions and the onlyones to negotiate national contracts. The other 12, with a combinedmembership of about 20,000, also were represented on thenegotiating team, Gilmore said.   ``It's a very modest agreement'' with minimal increases in wagesand cost-of-living adjustments, he said. Workers would lose inother areas, including medical insurance, night-shift pay and wagesfor newly-hired workers, he said.   Lessons learned from a 102-day strike in 1969 show that ``ittakes total unity of all unions in GE to take this company on andwin,'' the UE statement said.   GE thinks the agreement is fair, said spokesman Jack Batty, whoworks at the company's Fairfield, Conn., headquarters.   ``We believe that it's a good contract and that once the unionmembership understands it, they will ratify it,'' Batty said.   The agreement calls for three wage increases: 2.5 percent thisyear, 1.5 percent in 1989 and 1.5 percent in 1990 plus a $165 cashpayment in July 1988 and a $900 payment in June 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
