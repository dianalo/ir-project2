Resultsfrom this work provide general descriptions of the animals and majorplant communities present. A vegetation map derived from a combinationof on-site surveillance and remotely sensed imagery is provided as partof this report. Twenty-seven wildlife species of special interest (protected,sensitive, furbearer, game animal, etc.), and waterfowl, were observedon the proposed expansion area. Bird censuses revealed 13 raptorial species(including four of special interest: bald eagle, golden eagle, osprey,and prairie falcon); five upland game bird species (sage grouse, Californiaquail, chukar, gray partridge, and ring-necked pheasant); common loons(a species proposed for state listing as threatened); and five otherspecies of special interest (sage thrasher, loggerhead shrike, mourningdove, sage sparrow, and long-billed curlew). Estimates of waterfowl abundanceare included for the Priest Rapids Pool of the Columbia River. Six smallmammal species were captured during this study; one, the sagebrush vole,is a species of special interest. Two large animal species, mule deerand elk, were noted on the site. Five species of furbearing animals wereobserved (coyote, beaver, raccoon, mink, and striped skunk). Four speciesof reptiles and one amphibian were noted. Fisheries surveys were conductedto document the presence of gamefish, and sensitive-classified fish andaquatic invertebrates. Rainbow trout were the only fish collected withinthe boundaries of the proposed northern expansion area. 22 refs., 10figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
