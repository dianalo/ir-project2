WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House is overwhelmingly recommending anincrease in Social Security benefits for some working elderlyrecipients, telling its negotiators to accept that Senate-approvedprovision in a child care bill.   The House voted 384-36 Wednesday for a non-binding motion toinstruct its conferees on the bill. It acted despite warnings byopponents that the benefit increases for working retirees wouldcome at the expense of new programs.   ``It means a difficult choice between generations,'' said Rep.Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., a leading sponsor of the child care bill.   The vote came as the measure appeared to become more deeplymired in legislative disagreement.   Bills establishing major new child care programs and expandingothers, including the Head Start program, have followed a tortuouspath leading to House and Senate approval of far different packages.   The measures remain in two Senate-House conference committeescreated to resolve those differences, and one of the panels earlierthis week produced a preliminary agreement on several provisions.That plan would keep the Senate's plan for a new categorical blockgrant child care program, instead of the House version's expansionof entitlement programs.   That agreement appeared to run counter to House wishes. Thechamber voted 411-0 on May 9 not to instruct conferees not toaccept those Senate provisions on the main elements of a child carebill.   The House on Wednesday pointed to that vote and delivered adirect rebuke to its own conferees. It voted 416-0 on a secondnon-binding motion reaffirming its opposition to the Senate version.   Members said that accepting the Senate's provisions would promptPresident Bush's veto as well as lose important House support.   Neither vote binds the conferees, but they amount to recordedexpressions of the chamber's sentiment.   The motion on Social Security instructs the conferees to modifyand accept the Senate's rider, allowing people 65 to 69 years oldto earn more money through working while continuing to receivetheir retirement benefits.   Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., said it would relieve ``a devastatingpenalty'' that Social Security recipients must pay for continuingto work, often part time.   Opponents said the change in Social Security policy has no placein a child care bill and should await congressional budget talkswith the White House and other panels deliberating Social Securitychanges.   ``It would be truly unfortunate if we forgot that we are here toprovide help to children who would otherwise be left alone,'' saidRep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and MeansCommittee.   The provision added by the Senate would raise the annualearnings limitation for Social Security recipients by $1,200, to$10,560. For those earning up to $5,000 beyond that, SocialSecurity benefits would be reduced by $1 for every $4 earned.   Brown recommended altering the Senate's provision by delayingthe change in benefit reduction and recalculating lump-sum paymentsin the awarding of back benefits for some Social Securityrecipients. This in effect would reduce one benefit to pay forincreasing another.   The House Budget Committee chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta,D-Calif., estimated the bill's cost at $1.5 billion to $2.4billion. But Brown said the lump-sum reduction would produce morethan enough money to pay for the increase in the earningslimitation.   ``It has no effect at all on child care,'' Brown said. ``It inno way limits or restricts the funds available for child care.''</TEXT></DOC>
