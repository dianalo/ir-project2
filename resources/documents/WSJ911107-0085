U.S. District Judge Harold Barefoot Sanders of Dallas had&quot;obvious conflicts of interest,&quot; according to a formalcomplaint filed this week. The complaint said the conflictstemmed initially from his brother's employment as a topexecutive of Squibb Corp. and then of Glaxo Holdings PLC, twomajor competitors of defendant SmithKline Beecham PLC, whilethe case was in his court.                                                                                                          During that period, the complaint says, Judge Sanders alsobought and sold hundreds of shares of stock in Glaxo andSquibb, which made rival products to Tagamet, the SmithKlinedrug implicated in the injury suit.   Federal law requires that a judge disqualify himself fromany proceeding &quot;in which his impartiality might reasonably bequestioned.&quot; The code also calls for such a disqualificationwhenever a judge knows that he or members of his family havea financial interest or &quot;any other interest that could besubstantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.&quot;   Judge Sanders has declined to reopen the case and recusehimself. &quot;Neither Squibb nor Glaxo was a party to thislitigation,&quot; he wrote in a recent letter to the plaintiff. &quot;Iam not aware, and have never been aware, of any effect thatthe decision in your case would have had on Squibb or Glaxo.&quot;He declines to comment on the complaint.   Personal stock portfolios often force judges to dropcases. Federal judges, for example, frequently have recusedthemselves when they or their immediate family members ownedshares in companies that were plaintiffs or defendants. In apatent infringement case between Polaroid Corp. and EastmanKodak Co. a few years ago, the trial judge in Boston ruledfor Polaroid but recused herself later in the proceedingswhen her husband inherited Kodak shares from the estate ofher mother-in-law. Kodak protested unsuccessfully that thejudge never should have sat, given the mother-in-law'sinterest.   In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower-courtruling in Liljeberg vs. Health Services Acquisition Corp. andheld that the trial judge should have recused himself becausehe was a fiduciary trustee of Loyola Unversity in NewOrleans. Loyola wasn't a party to the suit, but it stood torealize a large financial gain from a real estatetransaction, depending on the case's outcome.   &quot;This is a real problem for judges,&quot; says Stephen Gillers,a law professor at New York University. &quot;In many cases, itcan be months or even years before all the litigants areidentified.&quot; Then, he says, the judge may have to disqualifyhimself, &quot;despite having invested a great deal of time andenergy on the case.&quot;   Thomas Latimer and his wife, Carol, brought the complaintagainst Judge Sanders in the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in New Orleans. Mr. Latimer fell ill in 1985 afterdoing extensive yardwork while taking prescribed doses ofTagamet. In his injury suit, dismissed by Judge Sanders in1989, Mr. Latimer claimed that the interaction of Tagametwith the pesticide diazinon caused damage to his brain,eyesight, hearing, balance and immune system. Mr. Latimer'sexperience was the subject of a front-page article in thisnewspaper Oct. 14.   The Latimers, who seek a new trial, want SmithKline toadvise doctors that, in prescribing Tagamet, there ispotential for interaction and neurological damage. TheLatimers believe such a ruling could also have a substantialfinancial impact on the ulcer drugs of Glaxo and the unit ofBristol-Myers Squibb Co., which are hystamine inhibitorssimilar to Tagamet.   The complaint against Judge Sanders quotes from atranscript of a closed hearing in the judge's chambers thatsuggests the judge coaxed the defendants' attorneys to seek asummary judgment for dismissal. The complaint also contendsthe judge made his dismissal decision based on opinionsexpressed by defendants' lawyers, rather than by reviewingthe scientific evidence of the case for himself.   Judge Sanders, 66 years old, was appointed to the federalbench in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter. In a survey ofDallas Bar Association members in May 1989, about 87% ofrespondents rated Judge Sanders as &quot;impartial,&quot; and 92% saidthey thought he showed &quot;proper judicial temperament.&quot;   This isn't the first time the judge's financial interestsand ties have been challenged. In 1986, plaintiffs' attorneysrepresenting three Hunt brothers tried unsuccessfully toremove him from their case against several large banks. Atthe time, Judge Sanders owned more than $250,000 of stock inAllied Bancshares Inc., and a lawyer for First National Bankof St. Paul was a partner with him in shopping center andwarehouse ventures. In 1987, Judge Sanders had to resign as adirector of Industrial Investment Corp. after pressure fromthe Judicial Ethics Committee.   ---   ROBERT MAXWELL'S death will deprive British libel lawyersof a big client.   Mr. Maxwell, the British-based media mogul who was founddead on Tuesday, was one of the most litigious people in thehistory of U.K. libel law. According to a partner at oneleading London law firm, the magnate generated about 10% ofthe U.K.'s libel cases &quot;in a good year,&quot; both as abelligerent plaintiff and as an unusually tenacious defendantin suits filed against his U.K. newspapers.   &quot;He certainly filed an amazing amount of writs,&quot; saidDavid Hooper, a London solicitor who has represented severaltargets of Mr. Maxwell's ire and is currently involved in asuit filed against Mr. Maxwell by Seymour Hersh, the U.S.investigative journalist. &quot;Whether we will ever see someoneuse libel law like that again, one doesn't know.&quot;   In U.K. law, as in the U.S., libel suits are &quot;personalactions,&quot; meaning their fate is expressly tied to theindividuals named as plaintiffs and defendents. This fact hasled to the journalistic maxim that &quot;you can't libel thedead.&quot; Any cases that involve Mr. Maxwell as the onlyplaintiff or defendent are now ended, with costs being borneby whoever incurred them.   In tribute to the power of a man who sued -- successfully-- over everything from allegations that he was a Soviet spyto allegations that he unfairly fired his chauffeur,newspapers in the U.K. shied away from reporting negativestories about Mr. Maxwell or any of his business enterprises.Mr. Maxwell usually contributed the proceeds from hisvictories in libel cases to charities, including children'shospitals and acquired immune deficiency syndromefoundations.   Since Mr. Maxwell's suits also were often filed on behalfof his newspapers, several high-profile cases may still bepursued by Mirror Group Newspapers. These include recentwrits filed against Mr. Hersh, for allegations that Mr.Maxwell had links to Israeli intelligence, and against theBritish Broadcasting Corp., for allegations that Mr. Maxwellrigged reader contests in the Daily Mirror.   Lawyers said that libel cases filed jointly against Mr.Maxwell and his newspapers, including the retaliatory writfrom Mr. Hersh, will probably continue once Mr. Maxwell hasbeen omitted as a defendant.   ---   LAWSUIT OVER ALL-MALE eating clubs at Princeton isreopened.   A federal judge in Trenton, N.J., ruled that a New JerseySupreme Court decision last year forcing the Tiger Inn andthe Ivy Club to admit women did not preclude a separatefederal constitutional review of the case. The decision, byU.S. District Court Judge John Lifland, revives a 12-year-olddispute that many thought had been settled. Both clubs nowhave women members.   Judge Lifland ruled that he will hear arguments on whetherbarring male-only membership infringes on theconstitutionally protected right to freedom of association,as lawyers for the clubs contend.   The Tiger and the Ivy were the last of Princeton's 12eating clubs to bar women, keeping curbs in place until theNew Jersey Supreme Court decision in July 1990. The statehigh court ruled that the policy violated the state'sprohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex inpublic accommodations.   The Tiger appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, whichrefused to hear the case last January. The Ivy, meanwhile,used a procedural maneuver to reserve its right to argue itsconstitutional claim in a separate federal suit now pendingin federal court in Trenton. Judge Lifland's decisionessentially allows the Tiger to join that suit on the groundthat the Tiger's constitutional claims have never been fullyaddressed.   The Ivy began accepting women a year ago, and the Tigerreluctantly followed suit last January, while voting tocontinue fighting the case in court. Russel H. Beatie Jr., aPrinceton alumnus and Tiger Inn member who represents theclub, said that if the male-only membership rule isultimately upheld it will be up to the two clubs' studentmembers, including women, to decide whether to reinstituteit.   Mr. Beatie said he and other lawyers in the case arepursuing it solely to protect the federal right to freedom ofassociation and to avoid paying damages and attorney fees toSally Frank, an assistant law professor and Princeton alumnuswho filed the original suit when she was a sophomore in 1978.   ---   GAY-RIGHTS LAWS get mixed results at the polls in fourcities.   Voters in St. Paul, Minn., rejected Tuesday an effort torepeal a one-year-old law banning discrimination againstgays. Like civil-rights laws adopted in several other citiesand states, the ordinance bans discrimination in housing,jobs and public accommodations on the basis of a person'ssexual orientation.   In San Francisco, a domestic-partnership ordinance wasupheld by voters. The law, adopted last year, gives unmarriedpartners of city employees the same benefits and protectionsgranted to married workers.   In contrast, voters in Concord, Calif., a city of 112,000east of San Francisco, removed sexual orientation as acategory in the city's human-rights ordinance. And voters inthe Detroit suburb of Ferndale, Mich., rejected a proposal toprohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB Co. doesn't make or sell a histamineinhibitor similar to SmithKline Beecham PLC's ulcer drug,Tagamet. In an earlier edition, a Legal Beat article about atrial judge's conduct in a case alleging injuries fromTagamet reported incorrectly that a Bristol-Myers Squibb unithad a rival product on the market. Since the company has nosuch product, the complaint against the trial judge is alsoincorrect in its assertion that the Tagamet lawsuit couldhave a financial impact on Bristol-Myers Squibb.
