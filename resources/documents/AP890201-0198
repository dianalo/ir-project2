Palestinian leaders rejected the idea, saying they would settlefor nothing less than a Palestinian state.   It was Shamir's most conciliatory remark yet on Israel's futurerole in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``Compared to his old stand, he has moved a step, but it is a farstep from meeting the demands or conditions of the Palestinianpeople. We can't accept it,'' said Faisal Husseini, considered thetop pro-PLO leader in the occupied lands.   Also Wednesday, 10 Arab teen-agers were wounded in clashes withtroops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including a 13-year-old boyshot in the head with a rubber bullet, Arab hospital officials said.The army confirmed five wounded.   In the West Bank town of Hebron, a firebomb was hurled at areligious seminary for Jewish settlers. A second firebomb was thrownat the troops that arrived to conduct searches, settlers said. Therewere no injuries or damage.   Shamir presented his idea to reporters after speaking to a groupof North American rabbis.   ``The peace process will be comprised of two stages,'' he said.``First an interim condition and this will include full autonomy. Inthe second stage (there will be) direct negotiations withoutpreconditions between Israel, Palestinian Arabs and Arab countries.''   ``At a certain stage when there is autonomy, the army will leaveseveral urban centers and be focused in some other areas,'' he said.   The withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas intosecurity pockets in the occupied territories is outlined in the 1978Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel, but Shamir has neverspecifically endorsed such a troop movement.   Although Shamir spoke of ``full autonomy'', the accords sayIsrael would still handle the terrorities' external and internalsecurity and foreign affairs.   The Camp David accords call for electing local Palestinians toparticipate in peace talks with Israel, Jordan and Egypt. Afive-year period of autonomy would precede negotiations on the finalstatus of the territories.   The Palestine Liberation Organization and many Palestiniansreject autonomy and the Camp David plan, saying these ideas areintended to sidestep the PLO and cheat the Palestinians out of astate.   ``Autonomy as proposed by Israel is totally rejected,'' saidBethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, responding to Shamir's latest offer.   ``Israel has to understand that we want a comprehensive peacesettlement ... that will ultimately achieve our sovereignty over theWest Bank and Gaza Strip,'' he said.   Shamir told the rabbis he would never meet with the PLO andcriticized Western nations for giving credibility to PLO chiefYasser Arafat's statements in December recognizing Israel andrenouncing terrorism.   ``Our rights are questioned as we witness a large part of theworld dancing at the PLO-Arafat festival, which has blinded them toreality and made them victims of delusions and deceptions,'' he said.   While offering concessions in the political arena, Israeliofficials have endorsed harsh army measures introduced last month toend the rebellion that began Dec. 8, 1987, and has since left 370Palestinians and 15 Israelis dead.   The new measures allow soldiers to fire plastic bullets atPalestinians fleeing riots and at those erecting roadblocks.   A Gaza City military court Tuesday sentenced six Palestinians,including two teen-agers, to up to two years in prison for stoningmilitary vehicles and other targets. No one was injured in theattacks.   The sentences were unprecedented. In the past, stone throwerswere fined or given a few months in jail.   Police arrested an Israeli who allegedly planned to sell the PLOinformation for $1.5 million, Israel radio said. The 40-year-oldman, whose name was not released, allegedly met with PLO officialsin Greece last month.   The man, detained Tuesday on his return at Ben Gurion Airportnear Tel Aviv, passed information to the PLO officials, the radiosaid. The report did not specify what kind of information wasallegedly passed or whether any money changed hands. No charges haveyet been filed.   An Israeli law passed in 1986 carries a three-year prison termfor unauthorized meetings with members of terrorist groups.</TEXT></DOC>
