The ultra-rightist Republicans, campaigning on a platform ofridding Berlin of foreigners, captured 7.5 percent of the vote and11 seats in the West Berlin legislature. It was the first time theygained a place in that body since their party was formed in 1983.   However, the conservative Christian Democrats, who suffered heavylosses in Sunday's vote, ruled out a coalition with Republicans.   The Republicans' national chairman is Franz Schoenhuber, a66-year-old former Nazi Waffen SS soldier. Under West Germany'scomplicated election laws, the party will also gain two seats in thenational parliament after the December 1990 federal elections.   National party leaders instructed West Berlin's ChristianDemocratic mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, to begin today's coalition talkswith his leftist Social Democratic rival Walter Momper.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats lost a natural allywhen the centrist Free Democrats failed to gain any seats in thelegislature. The two parties had governed West Berlin in a coalitionthat also controls the federal government.   Sunday's voting gave the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats55 seats each in the 138-seat house, while the far-left AlternativeList came away with 17 seats.   Momper said he would not govern with the Alternatives as long asthey insist on cutting back the number of Allied troops stationed inWest Berlin.   The outcome was overshadowed by the success of the Republicans,who say they have 1,000 card-carrying members in West Berlin andmore than 7,000 nationwide.   Kohl told a news conference in Bonn on Monday the outcome wasworrisome because of the Republicans' appeal among West Germans, whoare increasingly worried by a wave of foreigners competing for jobs,housing and social services.   ``There is an urgent need to discuss these problems and come upwith better solutions,'' Kohl said.   Mayor Diepgen, calling the elections ``a bitter loss,'' said theobvious surge in ultra-right support poses a serious challenge forthe leading political parties in the city and country.</TEXT></DOC>
