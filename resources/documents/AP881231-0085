The answer to that puzzling disparity is really the story of twoinsurance funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp. The FDIC and the FSLIC.   Those letters are emblazoned at the entrances of thousands offinancial institutions across the nation as a beacon of assurancefor the institution's depositors. It wasn't always that way.   Before there was federal deposit insurance, economic downturnswere not called recessions but panics, because that is often whatworried depositors did. At the first whiff of trouble, they wouldform long lines at the teller windows to withdraw their money.   During the Great Depression of the 1930s, hundreds of banksclosed, wiping out not only depositors who couldn't get to the bankin time but bank stockholders as well. For that reason, Congressstepped in and created the FDIC, to insure deposits at commercialbanks, and the FSLIC, to do the same at savings and loanassociations.   The mission of both agencies is the same: to put the government'sbacking behind deposits, now insuring up to $100,000 in each account.   But while the mission is identical, the economic fortunes of thetwo funds are not.   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, noted in a year-endmessage that the banks' insurance fund had handled a post-Depressionrecord of 221 bank failures and assistance packages in 1988, up from203 in 1987.   That figure is very close to the 216 Sandamp;Ls that the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC, expected to close bymidnight Saturday.   But while the FDIC closings have proceeded in a business-as-usualatmosphere largely out of the limelight, despite the large number,the FSLIC closings have grabbed headlines and triggered a spate ofcongressional investigations. The problems is also occupying a gooddeal of the time of President-elect Bush's transition team.   The difference is a disparity in the two fund's ability to pay tomop up the problems.   The wave of failed banks translated into an estimated loss forthe FDIC of between $3 billion and $4 billion in 1988, the firstyear the fund's assets have failed to grow. But even with thatdecline, the fund is expected to end the year with a tidy nest eggof $15 billion, down from $18.3 billion a year ago.   And Seidman predicted that the FDIC fund would begin growingagain in 1989 as the number of bank failures start declining. Whatthat means is that the turmoil in the banking industry caused byfinancial deregulation in the 1980s can be handled by the insurancefees assessed on the industry, without the need to resort to tappinggeneral revenues. It also means the FDIC can shut down insolventbanks on a timely basis.   That's not the case with the FSLIC fund, which has been forced tokeep hundreds of insolvent Sandamp;Ls open because it did not have themoney to deal with the problem, which keeps growing at a rate of $1billion a month.   Presently, the estimates of the ultimate cost of cleanup for theSandamp;L crisis range from a low of $50 billion, made by the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board, to a high of $112 billion, the latest projectionfrom the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress.   But the expectations of revenues the FSLIC will be receiving todeal with the crisis, primarily from assessments on healthy Sandamp;Ls,amount to only about $30 billion.   That means that even under the most optimistic assumptions,Congress and the incoming Bush administration will have to find away to bridge a gap of about $20 billion.   The Bush team _ led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who isstaying on in the new administration, and incoming Budget DirectorRichard Darman _ is already focusing on the problem.   Reports indicate that the new administration is currentlyfocusing on proposals that would limit the impact on the budget byresorting to various off-budget financial schemes and otheraccounting gimmicks.   However, many believe that this would be the wrong approach totake, compounding problems created by the Reagan administration whenit delayed facing up the full extent of the Sandamp;L crisis.   ``The Bush administration will be committing political suicide ifit doesn't candidly address the problem immediately after takingoffice,'' said Bery Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va.   But crafting a politically acceptable solution will not be easy,given the magnitude of the final cost to taxpayers.   ``The bailout to come will be the largest ever in the history ofthe United States. It will be far bigger than the combined cost ofthe assistance given, after intensive congressional scrutiny, toChrysler, Lockheed and New York City,'' retiring Sen. WilliamProxmire observed in a recent speech. ``To make the bad news evenworse, the longer Congress waits to appropriate the money, thegreater the ultimate cost will be to the nation's taxpayers.''</TEXT></DOC>
