Non-farm output also improved more than noted in the initial report. Both increases were the largest since the first quarter of 1986, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.    Non-farm productivity has been gaining momentum this year, rising for three straight quarters after staying mostly flat for nearly a year. And the third quarter's 3.6% annual rate of increase substantially exceeded the 1.4% rate of the second quarter.    Productivity is the measure of output for each hour worked. The statistics are adjusted for seasonal variations.    Productivity usually rises steeply in the early stages of a business recovery and tapers off in the later stages, when output slows relative to the number of workers. Productivity in the current business expansion reached a high in the second quarter of 1983, spurting at a 7.1% annual rate.    The latest productivity figures follow other reports of economic activity that showed robust growth prior to the Oct. 19 market crash, although many analysts expect growth to slow in coming months. The Commerce Department last week raised its estimate of third-quarter growth in the real gross national product to a 4.1% annual rate from an earlier estimate of 3.8%. Real GNP is the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services.    A separate Commerce Department report last week depicted a revived industrial sector driving October economic growth, spurred partly by improved exports, but with consumer spending slowing in response to heavy debt and other factors.    &quot;The strong growth in real (GNP) was certainly helpful to productivity,&quot; said John W. Kendrick, an economist at George Washington University. He said productivity has lately been helped by a reversal of some factors that had held it down in the 1970s and into the 1980s; inflation lately has eroded, research has increased and labor efficiency has improved.    The Labor Department report measured productivity before the October stock market plunge. Mr. Kendrick said that if, because of the crash, &quot;confidence was shaken enough to cause consumers to pull in their horns,&quot; that could lower output and investment, in turn affecting productivity. But he said the crash won't cause a recession by itself, though it might result in slower growth and prevent large productivity gains.    In the third quarter, according to the Labor Department's revised figures, nonfarm output rose at a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 4.4% rate shown in last month's preliminary report and from the 3.2% annual rate of the second quarter. Hours worked increased at a 1.8% annual rate, up from the 1.7% initially reported for the third quarter.    Hourly non-farm compensation rose at a 3.8% annual rate in nominal terms, off from the 4% increase reflected in the preliminary report. But it declined 0.1% when inflation was taken into account, for the third straight quarterly drop in the inflation-adjusted rate. Unit labor costs increased at a 0.2% annual rate, less than the 1.3% rate reported last month for the quarter, and well below the second-quarter annual rate of 1.5%.    Manufacturing productivity rose at a 3.8% annual rate in the third quarter, slipping from the 4.5% rate reported initially, while manufacturing output grew at a 7.4% annual rate, down from the preliminary figure of 8.2%. Hours worked increased at a 3.5% annual rate.    The annual rates of change for hourly compensation in manufacturing in the third quarter were little changed from the preliminary report. But the revised report showed a 2.3% annual rate of decline in unit labor costs, smaller than the 3% rate of decrease initially reported.    Revised rates of increase for overall business, including farms, increased to a 4% annual rate for productivity, 5.4% for output and 1.4% for hours worked. But the rate of gain for hourly compensation eased to a 4% annual rate from a 4.2% rate in the preliminary report, while unit labor costs went up only 0.1%, compared with a 1.3% rate in the preliminary report, for the smallest rise since the decrease in the first quarter of 1986.    The Labor Department also issued preliminary third-quarter figures for nonfinancial corporations, which account for almost 60% of the nation's output. Productivity for this sector rose at a 2.6% annual rate, compared with a 0.7% rate in the second quarter. Output gained 5.5% on an annual basis and hours worked rose 2.8%, compared with second-quarter increases of 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively.    Hourly compensation at nonfinancial firms rose at an annual rate of 3% in nominal terms, but fell 0.8% when adjusted for inflation. Second-quarter hourly compensation rose at an annual nominal rate of 2.6%, but fell 2.2% on an inflation-adjusted basis. Unit labor costs increased at a 0.4% yearly rate in the third quarter, after a 2% rate of gain in the second quarter.    Profit per dollar of output for such firms grew at a 25% annual rate last quarter, sharply higher than the previous quarter's 2.1% rate, for the largest quarterly increase since a 34.7% annual rate of increase in the 1985 third quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
