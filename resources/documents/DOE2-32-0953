The study presents a promisinganalytical method (indicators, technometry). Details on the pioneer activitiesgoing on in Japan and details on the fundamentals of technometry andtechnological indicators are followed by a presentation of selected fieldsof technology, namely immobilized biocatalysts, genetically produceddrugs, power engineering (solar cells and solar cell arrays), physicaltechnologies (laser radiation sources), measurement techniques (sensors),production engineering (industrial robots, market and technology reports,technico-scientific evaluation). The study concludes with explaininga number of results applicable to all the fields discussed (technologicalindicators, macroeconomic indicators, technico-economic indicators forselected fields of technology.
