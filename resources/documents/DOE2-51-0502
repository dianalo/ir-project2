It is a methodin which the scrubbing liquid is mixed with salts which, with nitrogenmonoxide, form complexes such as iron nitrosyl complexes, which are reducedto elementary nitrogen and water at a potentiostatically connected cathodeby adding formic acid to prevent the precipitation of iron-III hydroxide.In order to prevent the precipitation and reduction of iron-II, it is,according to invention, suggested that tartaric acid and/or citric acidbe added to the scrubbing liquid. According to a NO/sub x/ pollutionof e.g. 600-2000 mg the admixture of acid is preferably between 2-4 g/l.</TEXT></DOC>
