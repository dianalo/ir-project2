The study, commissioned by a group of California, Oregonand Texas credit unions, says the large amount of creditunion funds deposited in foreign banks represents a&quot;questionable policy&quot; that should be examined by regulatorsand Congress.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;None of these funds is covered by U.S. deposit insurancebut are subject to default risk with varying degrees ofexplicit and implicit insurance guarantees by foreigngovernments,&quot; says the report, written by James R. Barth ofAuburn University and R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., a consultant andformer researcher at Stanford University. &quot;Whether the risksassociated with these deposits are being adequately assessedshould be examined by the appropriate regulatory authoritiesand the Congress,&quot; the report says.   The report concludes, however, that the credit unionsystem and its deposit-insurance fund are healthy enough tohandle potential credit union failures without the need for ataxpayer bailout.   Though the report criticizes some aspects of credit unionregulation, it says that only a &quot;momentous unexpectednational economic downturn&quot; could weaken credit unions andtheir insurance fund enough to require taxpayer funds. Incontrast to their opinion of the credit union system, Messrs.Barth and Brumbaugh have said the commercial bank depositinsurance fund is in far worse shape than regulatorsacknowledge. The economists also were early predictors of theinsolvency of the savings and loan deposit insurance fund.   Credit union officials don't dispute the report's dataabout funds deposited in foreign banks. They say the amountof deposits with foreign banks has increased recently becausethe credit ratings of many of the largest U.S. banks havedropped, while the ratings of many big Japanese and Europeanbanks remained high.   &quot;It used to be much less concentrated in foreign banks,&quot;says William Hampel, chief economist of the Credit UnionNational Association, a trade group. &quot;Over the last 18months, banking institutions around the world have haddeclining credit quality and the credit quality of foreignbanks has held up much better than the credit quality of U.S.banks,&quot; says Mr. Hampel. He also said that foreign banks tendto pay slightly higher rates on shortterm deposits than U.S.banks with equivalent credit ratings.   Mr. Hampel said the credit union system has put arelatively high proportion of its funds in bank depositsrather than loans because credit union members overall aresaving more than they are borrowing. Credit unions areorganized for groups of people with a common interest, suchas working for the same company or belonging to the samechurch, and put most of their assets into consumer,automobile and home loans.   The foreign deposits highlighted in the Barth-Brumbaughreport were made by the U.S. Central Credit Union, which actsmuch like a money-market mutual fund for local credit unions.Many of the nation's 15,000 credit unions deposit some oftheir funds with 43 so-called &quot;corporate&quot; credit unions,whose members consist only of other credit unions. All butone of the corporate credit unions are members of U.S.Central, and deposit most of their funds with U.S. Central.U.S. Central, in turn, deposits nearly all its funds in largeforeign and U.S. banks.   Mr. Hampel, who is a member of the U.S. Central investmentadvisory committee, said he believes that large concentrationof deposits in foreign banks isn't &quot;a potential source ofdifficulty,&quot; but said Congress should examine the practice asit investigates other aspects of the federal depositinsurance system.   &quot;I don't think when Congress looks at this they would findanything to be concerned about but they certainly should lookat it,&quot; Mr. Hampel said.   The largest deposits by U.S. Central were all with bigJapanese banks as of March 12, the latest day for which Mr.Hampel could provide data. The five, where U.S. Central'sdeposits ranged from $1.3 billion down to about $800 millioneach, were: Mitsubishi Bank, Fuji Bank, Tokai bank, SanwaBank, and Industrial Bank of Japan. U.S. Central's depositsare made in U.S.-dollar denominated accounts and generallyare made with U.S. branches of foreign banks or withU.S.-chartered bank subsidiaries of foreign-based banks.</TEXT></DOC>
