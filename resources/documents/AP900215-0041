Also Wednesday, thousands of people turned out to hear his mainopponent, La Prensa publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, at tworallies on the sparsely populated Atlantic Coast. The rallies inPuerto Cabezas and Bluefields followed endorsements of her UnitedNational Opposition by leaders of the Yatama Indians, who dominatethe region.   Ortega's threat was in response to a recent speech by oppositionvice president Virgilio Godoy, who said if the 14-party oppositioncoalition wins the Feb. 25 election, ``we are going to make theSandinistas pay the bills one by one'' for alleged violations ofhuman, civil and political rights.   The Sandinista leader challenged the leaders of the U.S.-backedopposition to repeat Godoy's words before international observersmonitoring the elections.   Ortega repeated accusations he made Tuesday that theU.S.-supported Contra rebels and opposition leaders were planningto disrupt the campaign.   After meeting with Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the RomanCatholic archbishop of Managua, Ortega told reporters late Tuesdaythat about 2,000 rebels had infiltrated northern Nicaragua frombases in neighborhing Honduras to disrupt the voting.   Ortega also accused opposition leaders of planning to call theelections fraudulent.   ``Since they know they have already lost the elections, theyhave this plan of saying there was fraud and the elections would beinvalid,'' Ortega said Wednesday. He also said the army was takingaction to neutralize any Contra infiltrators.   About 1.7 million voters go to the polls Feb. 25 to choose apresident and vice president, a National Assembly, municipalcouncils for 144 towns and two regional councils for the AtlanticCoast.   The United States cut off military aid to the Contras inFebruary 1988 but has continued to supply them with non-lethal aidas a means of putting pressure on the Sandinistas so they stand bytheir promise to conduct free elections.</TEXT></DOC>
