SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Solicitor General Charles Fried said Tuesdaythe resignations of two top-level colleagues at the JusticeDepartment are leading him to reconsider his future in the Reaganadministration.   ``This development implicates every sort of question,'' Friedsaid in the second of two interviews with The Associated Press.``The possibilities include my departure, or that this is just atempest in a teapot or many other things as well.''   Fried, who represents the government in the Supreme Court, saidhe learned about the resignations on Monday, the day beforeAttorney General Edwin Meese was told.   ``I got a heads-up, a courtesy call to let me know in advance,''Fried said of the departures.   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant AttorneyGeneral William Weld, who heads the department's criminal division,announced their resignations Tuesday. Two personal assistants toeach man also quit.   Told that acquaintances had said he might join the pair inleaving, Fried replied, ``They seem to know my mind better than Ido.''   He said he was home with the flu on Tuesday and had a SupremeCourt argument scheduled Wednesday morning.   ``I want to get through tomorrow and then I've got to think itthrough,'' Fried said. ``I don't know the significance of thesedepartures.   ``Once I get through tomorrow, I plan to think it through,'' hesaid in the first interview.   Fried, after the initial interview, called back to stress thathis departure was by no means the only possible outcome of hisdeliberations.   The 53-year-old former Harvard Law School professor becamesolicitor general in late 1985, succeeding Rex Lee.   Fried has been closely aligned with conservative legal theoristswho have risen to power under Meese.   But one source familiar with events leading to the resignationssaid Fried had been working with Burns on naming James M. Spears tohead the civil division earlier this month when they were surprisedto learn in a newspaper that Meese's ultra-conservative counselorWilliam Bradford Reynolds engineered the selection of anotherdepartment offcial, John Bolton, for the post.   The resignations came amid a year-old criminal investigation ofMeese but there was nothing to link them directly to any newdevelopments in that probe, department sources said.   One source said the precipitating factor at this time was aninternal fight over the successor to Stephen Trott as associateattorney general, the department's No. 3 post.   Burns unsuccessfully supported Weld for this post, according tothis source. Weld was unwilling to stay when he was passed over forthe promotion, in part because his two predecessors as criminaldivision chiefs, Lowell Jensen and Trott, both had won the samepromotion.   This source said Weld believed he was being punished fordisagreeing on legal issues with Meese and his top aides.   Burns was angered to learn that Reynolds has gotten Meese'sprivate approval to name as associate attorney general FrankKeating, the assistant Treasury secretary who supervises theCustoms Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   Another department source said, however, these fights might nothave had so much significance were Meese not under the cloud of acontinuing criminal investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
