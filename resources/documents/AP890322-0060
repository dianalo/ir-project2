(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A college student on spring break tried toretrieve a boat that broke anchor and wound up floating in the Gulfof Mexico for eight hours before he was rescued by the Coast Guard.   David Smith, 25, of Atlanta, was treated for hypothermia at a St.Petersburg Hospital and released Tuesday. A companion, FrankBotdorf, managed to swim ashore in three hours and did not requiremedical treatment.   Botdorf and Smith dove into the water off Tampa Bay about 1 a.m.Monday when they noticed their rented 19-foot powerboat floatingaway from the waterfront restaurant where they had dinner.   Although the boat was only 100 yards offshore, the outgoing tidequickly carried both men about two miles into the dark waters westof the bay.   Smith, who was not wearing a life jacket, said he rested byfloating on his back. He was pulled from the gulf more than a milewest of Egmont Key by a Coast Guard helicopter at 9:20 a.m.</TEXT></DOC>
