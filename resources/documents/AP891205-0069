A warm front headed across the middle Atlantic states today,with New York City expecting a high in the upper 30s, up 10 degreesfrom Monday, when temperatures were freezing all day from the GreatLakes to the northern Atlantic Coast, with highs only in the teensin northern New England.   But cold air held its ground today in upstate New York, withlows today of 14 below zero at Watertown and 13 below in Massena,according to the National Weather Service. Albany tied a 1926record of 2 degrees and Binghamton tied its record of 5 degrees.   Much of New England also is staying cold with more bone-chillingtemperatures, stiff wind and snow flurries expected.   ``We may be lucky to hit the 32 mark all week,'' said ScottReynolds, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Vermont.Monday's high was 15 degrees in many parts of the state.   A ferocious weekend snowstorm in northern Maine left Caribouunder 21 inches of fresh snow, for a total depth of 30 inches, andhigh wind Monday caused widespread drifting.   When temperatures dipped into the teens in New York City onMonday, officials said transit police did not evict the homelessfrom subways or stations except in extreme cases.   ``Stations are not shelters or houses, but we recognize thatit's cold out there,'' said Caren Gardner, a Transit Authorityspokeswoman. ``We're not cruel and inhuman, we're not going to putthem out on the street.''   The city's 24 shelters housed 8,900 people Sunday night.   In New Jersey, the year's first blast of severe cold weatheralso filled shelters as scores of homeless people escaped windchill temperatures of minus 30 degrees.   ``We had to send people away, right back into the cold,'' saidElizabeth Jones, a spokeswoman for the 16-bed Salvation Armyshelter in Elizabeth. ``There were more people than there wasroom.''   Monday's low of 15 degrees, recorded at Newark InternationalAirport, was far below the normal low of 32, said Harry Woodworth,a National Weather Service meteorologist. Today's low was 24degrees.   In Boston, the Pine Street Inn, which provides 730 beds for thehomeless, was full Sunday, with some people staying in the lobby.   A low of 18 and wind chill of minus 10 to minus 25, plus alreadycrowded shelters, forced Philadelphia officials to add 125 beds forthe homeless, to a total of 2,975. Today's low was 29, with anexpected high of 45.   In Florida, generally warmer temperatures were forecast todaywith highs from the low to mid 60s in the north to the mid 70s inthe south, the weather service said.   Temperatures hit record lows Monday across the state, including47 at Miami, 39 at Fort Myers, 33 at Tampa, 40 at St. Petersburgand 27 at Apalachicola. But today's low at Miami was 53, with 41 atTampa, 43 at Fort Myers and 36 at Apalachicola.   Most of Alabama also had record lows, including 25 at the Gulfof Mexico port of Mobile.
