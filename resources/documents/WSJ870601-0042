The big ad agency group proposed several months ago the merger of its Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Compton Inc. unit with its DFS Dorland Worldwide Inc. unit. It also proposed to merge its Ted Bates Worldwide Inc. unit with the Backer andamp; Spielvogel Inc. subsidiary.    Saatchi never has discussed either proposal publicly. The company is believed to want the two mergers, however, because both Bates and Compton, while large, have lackluster reputations, and it is hoped that the strong management teams at Backer and DFS could turn them around.    Both mergers have been held up by debate over how the two surviving companies should be structured and which executives should lead them. Saatchi also wanted to get approval from the ad agencies' most important clients.    A big hurdle in the Compton-DFS merger was overcome Friday, however, when Procter andamp; Gamble Co., a major Compton client, approved the merger, ad sources said. One source said that as a result of that approval, the Compton-DFS marriage is a &quot;done deal&quot; and that it could be announced in the next 10 days. A Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC spokeswoman declined comment on either proposed merger.    Procter andamp; Gamble officials couldn't be reached for comment yesterday evening.    The Compton-DFS merger would affect only the U.S. businesses of both agencies and would create a company with combined billings of about $1.2 billion, according to sources familiar with the proposal. Ad agencies traditionally take 15% of billings as a commission.    A Bates-Backer deal also may be struck by next week, one source indicated. Some issues between the two are still outstanding, however, particularly Saatchi's contract with Backer, which must be renegotiated. The contract, dating from Saatchi's purchase of Backer for more than $50 million last year, gives Backer and its chairman and chief executive, Carl Spielvogel, considerable autonomy.    Backer's clients include Miller Brewing Co. and on Friday, it was named one of three finalists in the competition for the Wendy's International Inc. account. A Backer-Bates combination would have $3.7 billion in billings, and would be headed by Mr. Spielvogel -- even though his agency accounts for only about $450 million of those billings.    Meanwhile, other difficulties must be resolved if a Compton-DFS merger is to be worked out. Saatchi has proposed that DFS executives lead the combined company and suggested doing away with the Compton name. After the proposal was made in late April, Edward L. Wax, Compton's president and chief executive, rejected it, saying, &quot;The initial proposal, in effect, was a takeover, and we would lose our identity.&quot; Mr. Wax couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    A Compton-DFS merger also would have to resolve potential client conflicts: American Motors Corp. is a Compton client, for example, while Toyota Motors Sales USA is at DFS Dorland. </TEXT></DOC>
