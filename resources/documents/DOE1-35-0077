Twenty-two liver tumors have been observed in dogsexposed to beta-emitting radionuclides, mainly {sup 144}Ce, and one livertumor in a dog exposed to {sup 238}Pu. Two liver cancers were also observedin control dogs. The risk of liver cancer in dogs that inhaled beta-emittingradionuclides was calculated to be 90 liver cancers per million rads.The risk of liver cancers in dogs in our studies and in studies at theUniversity of Utah, when compared to the incidence of liver tumors inhumans exposed to Thorotrast, suggest that the risk of liver cancer froman inhaled beta-emitting radionuclide in people is about 30 liver cancersper million person-rads. 19 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
