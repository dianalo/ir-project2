Now, the Brooklyn, N.Y., utility wants to increase that to 25%. Other gas utilities throughout the U.S. Northeast want more Canadian gas as well.    Meanwhile, Canada's natural gas industry, whose traditional U.S. Midwest market is shrinking, is eager to meet the demand. Hundreds of Canadian gas producers are flush with reserves while those of their U.S. competitors are dwindling. At the same time, 10 separate proposals have emerged to build the expanded pipeline capacity necessary to deliver the gas to market.    But despite eager customers and suppliers at the ends the pipeline, an array of obstacles, including regulatory gridlock in Washington, is stalling everyone's plans. Of the 10 pipeline-expansion proposals, only two small ones appear likely to proceed this year. Most of the others are bogged down by controversies at the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.    &quot;FERC is clogged right up tight,&quot; says Stanley Ironstone, director of the gas branch of Canada's National Energy Board, a federal regulatory and advisory agency. He doesn't think much new gas will move by 1988 &quot;unless a miracle happens; 1990 is more likely.&quot;    Indeed, the unusually large number of pipeline expansion proposals has inundated U.S. regulators, which are already burdened with other natural gas concerns. &quot;Things become much more difficult when you have to evaluate a multiplicity of proposals,&quot; says Richard O'Neill, director of FERC's office of producer and pipeline regulations. &quot;I'm not sure we can approve them all without overloading the capacity of the Northeast,&quot; he says.    The proposals have attracted opposition from several camps. Some U.S. gas producers and fuel oil distributors have filed objections, fearing that additional Canadian gas will disrupt their markets. Environmentalists oppose certain pipeline routes. And a policy change in U.S. gas-project regulations intended to speed the process has contributed to the gridlock because the policy may not mesh with older rules.    The new fast-track policy allows pipelines to be built with a minimum of regulatory interference, provided that the sponsors assume all the financial risks. Normally, such risks are shared with consumers through regulated transportation charges on fuel bills.    U.S. distributors such as Brooklyn Union are attracted to Canadian gas by both availability and price.    &quot;In the 1960s, it was considered prudent to back contracts with 20 years of reserves, and Canadians can still provide that kind of security,&quot; says Orlando Magnani, Brooklyn Union's regulatory affairs manager. In contrast, he says, his company's largest Gulf Coast supplier has just four years of gas reserves backing current deliveries.    Moreover, to keep the gas attractive, the Canadians have accepted prices, for five of the 10 projects, that will float according to indexes of competing energy costs in the northeastern market.    In Northeast U.S. markets, Alberta gas remains competitive even though it must be piped twice as far as supplies from the Gulf Coast. Michael Lucy, spokesman for a $681 million expansion project called Alberta Northeast Gas, says contracted Canadian gas would have arrived in New York for $3.20 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) if the price-indexed deliveries had occurred last year. The price is less than that for supplies then provided by two of the three major Gulf Coast pipelines, he says.    A $10 million oil-pipeline conversion project would have brought price-indexed Alberta gas to New England cities last year for an average of $2.46 per mcf, or 28 cents cheaper than the least-expensive contracted U.S. supplies, says Bay State Gas Co., a co-sponsor in Canton, Mass. The distribution company says it is close to receiving approvals that would enable it to receive the gas beginning Nov. 1 from Shell Canada Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta, producer and member of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.    A firm 20-year commitment from Canadian suppliers convinced a consortium called Ocean State Power to rely exclusively on Alberta gas to fuel a proposed electricity plant in Rhode Island, says Carlos Rivas, project spokesman. The $160 million project is scheduled to begin producing power in 1989, provided that FERC approves a $58 million pipeline link in the U.S. this year.    To U.S. buyers who remember the shortages of the 1970s, Alberta gas is comforting because the province has a 28-year supply inventory at current rates of consumption. U.S. gas producers also have excess gas for immediate delivery, but few can match Alberta's contracts because proved reserves in the lower 48 states would last less than 10 years at current consumption rates.    To help the Canadian sales effort, federal gas regulators in Ottawa have quickly approved several export applications to the U.S. Northeast. The U.S. process has been much slower, however, as indicated by the six-year-long Boundary Gas import hearing at FERC. The still-unfinished hearing has moved so slowly that the presiding judge, Bruce Birchman, recently called it &quot;less exciting than watching wall paint dry.&quot;    The import hearing is named after a project sponsored by 15 Northeast U.S. gas distributors to boost deliveries through a pipeline that crosses the international border at Niagara Falls. The pipeline, which is the only direct link from Canada to major U.S. Northeast cities, already transports between 27 billion and 55 billion cubic feet, or bcf, of gas annually. A unit of Houston-based Tenneco Inc., which owns the pipeline, says it is close to receiving U.S. approval to transport a further 19.2 bcf annually from Canada to the 15 distributors beginning in November.    For the past few years, the hearing has involved this expansion project and several larger competing pipeline developments. More recently, even more competitors have come forward, prompting Judge Birchman to defer the hearing until the regulatory agency's five governing commissioners decide whether all the applicants should be examined together.    This decision will be controversial, partly because two of the recent import projects have applied for the new fast-track approval expressly to avoid such regulatory delays. But if the fast-track projects are approved first, prospects for their competitors could be ruined.    &quot;There are a lot of tricky issues in those proposals,&quot; says Mr. O'Neill, the FERC official. &quot;I think it is reasonable to expect some decisions to come this year, but I can't promise that,&quot; he says.    ---               Natural Gas Pipeline Expansion        Proposals for Canadian Gas to U.S. Northeast                           Estimated Cost                           (In millions of                           U.S. dollars)   Added  Gas Supply                Proposed   --------------  Annual   Contract Name           Start      U.S.    Canada  Volume*      Term Boundary       1987       $60     $8      19     10 years Bay State- Shell Canada   1987        5       5      9      11 years Alberta Northeast Gas (Iroquois pipeline)      1988        419     262    144    15 years Canadian Gateway        1987-88     239     N.A.   143    12 years** Erie Pipeline  1988        313     N.A.   155*** N.C.
