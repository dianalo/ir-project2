Schools were closedbecause of an eruption Monday.   The mountain remained active, but there were no significanteruptions ollowing Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steameight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darknessand blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up tothree-quarters of an inch of ash.   In Washington state, scientists monitoring Mount St. Helensdetected little seismic activity Tuesday, but said they're notready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber followingweekend earthquakes.   Mount Redoubt's latest eruption occurred with little warning.Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said their mostsensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week, sothey may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activitywhich signalled previous eruptions.   Unlike previous eruptions, there was no dome built up over theeruptive vent prior to Monday's eruption. That prompted scientiststo warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occurwithout warning.   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had been dormantfor more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptionsbegan Dec. 13.   Monday's ash plume mostly missed the major populationconcentrations around Kenai and Homer, but the grit was heavyenough for officials to close schools Tuesday in Kenai, Soldotna,Nikiski and Sterling.   No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanicactivity, but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by thealmost continuous eruptions.   At Mount St. Helens, the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash90 miles to the east, surprising scientists.   ``It looks quiet right now, but I can't say it's going to staycalm,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of WashingtonGeophysics Center in Seattle, 100 miles north of Mount St. Helens.   ``It doesn't look at the present time like any eruption isimminent,'' she said. ``One thing we've learned, though, isanything can change.''   Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, saidCliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade VolcanoObservatory.   ``We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rainand wind and clouds,'' Hall said.   Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from thevolcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rockbeneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released bycooling molten rock.   Ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested andfound to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather thanfreshly erupted matter.   The volcano's last major eruption occurred on March 19, 1982. Acataclysmic explosion on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people, devastated230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe.</TEXT></DOC>
