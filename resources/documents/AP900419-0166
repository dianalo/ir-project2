But the Secret Service took Otto Lakas at his word and he wasbeing held without bail on a federal charge of threatening to killthe president.   ``I was not serious. Not at all,'' Otto Lakas said in anjailhouse interview. ``I didn't do anything. I am very confused.All I know is that I am in jail.''   Lakas, a 21-year-old architecture student at Lubbock ChristianUniversity, was arrested Tuesday after a Secret Serviceinvestigation. Police said Lakas had no previous record.   According to court documents from the Secret Service, Lakastried to buy a .357 Colt revolver at the Exect Pawn Shop and toldclerk Stacy Nichols, ``I have a .223-caliber rifle at home and abullet with Bush's name engraved on it.   ``Bush is coming to Lubbock and I will blow his ... head off.''   The White House has announced no plans for a Bush visit toLubbock, although Bush is scheduled to visit Dallas, Houston andAustin in May.   Federal agents say Lakas was upset over last December's U.S.invasion of Panama, which resulted in the arrest of Panama'sleader, Gen. Manuel Noriega, on drug charges.   ``The U.S. got a bad guy but a lot of good people were hurt,'' aSecret Service affidavit quoted Lakas as saying to Nichols, whotwice refused to sell him a gun.   Lakas' father, Demetrio B. Lakas, was figurehead president ofPanama from 1972 to 1978, during the time Panama was ruled by Gen.Omar Torrijos.   Noriega was a disciple of Torrijos and gained ascendancy in themilitary after the popular leader died in a 1981 plane crash.   Lakas' brother, Basilio, on Wednesday told the Texas Techstudent newspaper, The University Daily, that ``the whole thing isa misunderstanding, and there is no reason to blow it out ofproportion.''   In the affidavit for a search warrant, the Secret Service saidLakas tried on April 2 to buy a Colt revolver at the pawnshop butwas turned away by Nichols because he did not have a Texas driver'slicense or a state identification card.   On April 4, Lakas went back to the same pawnshop, produced aTexas identification card and told Nichols he wanted to send theweapon to his father in Panama, according to the affidavit.   When Nichols told Lakas that he could go to jail for making athreat against Bush, Lakas said, ``they will not mess with me''because of his family connections in Panama, according to theSecret Service.   Nichols told Lakas to think about buying the gun and returnlater. Lakas did not return, but called Nichols later to say he nolonger wanted to buy the gun, court documents said.   ``Most pawnbrokers would not have thought twice about taking$850 for the gun, which is what he offered to pay for it,'' Nicholssaid Thursday. ``But I said no. I was just doing my civic duty.''   Nichols said he waited two weeks to tell federal agents about itbecause he feared reprisals by Lakas. He notified authorities onMonday.   The Secret Service said agents searched Lakas' house Tuesday andfound a stun gun and a BB-gun.</TEXT></DOC>
