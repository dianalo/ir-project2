I couldn'twalk, I couldn't talk, I couldn't think,&quot; said Tim Howard, a client at thecounty's Palo Alto clinic. &quot;If not for the . . . clinic, I would not be herealive today. I can't stress here in one minute the importance of a person'slife, but thank you.&quot;;    Among the programs tentatively restored bysupervisors were:;    (check) Public health nursing and adult mental healthprograms at San Jose's Blossom Valley Multi-Service Center.;    (check) TheJulian Street Inn, a 69-bed shelter for mentally ill homeless residentsoperated by San Jose Urban Ministry.;    (check) The Sanctuary, a 29-unittransitional housing program for mentally ill residents run by EmergencyHousing Consortium.;    (check) Casa Feliz, a 60-unit residence hotel formentally ill residents run by Housing for Independent People.;    (check) TheChildren's Counseling Center, a day treatment and education program operatedby Catholic Charities.;    (check) The New Heritage program, a county-run daytreatment center for teen-agers.;    (check) Staffing at county-operatedmental health clinics in Palo Alto, East San Jose, West San Jose and Gilroy.;   County employees, private program operators and clients expressed reliefover the reprieve.;    &quot;It was great. We had some anxieties,&quot; said TerryMartin, a public health nurse. &quot;We had heard four weeks ago that the programwas back on, but then we heard it wasn't. It was touch and go; we didn't knowwhat would happen.&quot;;    Despite the reinstatement of county mental healthworkers, there still will be cuts in services at clinics in Gilroy, Palo Altoand Blossom Valley.;    &quot;I'm not prepared today to recommend any cuts in ourprograms for the homeless,&quot; said Supervisor Ron Gonzales. &quot;If we cut programs,these people will simply start showing up in other areas of our budget.&quot;;   Supervisor Zoe Lofgren pushed hard for reinstatement of county mental healthclinic staffing.;    To pay for these programs, the board is banking on threepossible funding sources.;    The first item is a new state law that could netthe county an estimated $47 million a year under a revised system of federalMedicaid payments. That legislation, however, has not yet been approved by thefederal government.;    Another possible funding source is an estimated $11million from state tobacco tax funds.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEPHEN ROBITAILLE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910807  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  522  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday August 7, 199100220147,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
