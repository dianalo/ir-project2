Barriers remain, &quot;not the least of which is the residualeffect of more than 40 years of Japanese tradeprotectionism,&quot; the report notes, but &quot;while many believe itimpossible to succeed in Japan, a growing number of Americancompanies in the market have come to prosper.&quot;   The study was based on responses from 340 U.S. companiesand interviews with executives in both countries. About 32%of the respondents viewed keiretsu, or interlinking Japanesecorporate relationships, as a positive factor for trade andinvestment in Japan; only 23% saw these as a negativeinfluence, and 44% said keiretsu have no effect, which mayraise questions about U.S. trade negotiators' recent push toget Tokyo to concede that keiretsu block market access.   Japan's high land costs and tight labor market were themost commonly cited obstacles to business. Keiretsurelationships came in fourth, behind the &quot;short-termmanagement outlook&quot; at U.S. home offices. Of companiessurveyed, 41% are meeting or exceeding their financialtargets for Japan.                                                                                                          AID FOR PLANNED SOVIET BANK                                                                                                          The new European Bank for Reconstruction and Developmentplans to help set up a bank in the Soviet Union. TheLondon-based EBRD clinched the accord this week with theState Bank of the U.S.S.R., which has been seeking help fromthe West in establishing a commercial bank. The new bank isto finance projects deemed essential to free-marketdevelopment. It could be owned partly by the Sovietgovernment and private and public institutions in the West.                                                                                                          OUTLOOK FOR INVESTING IN LEBANON                                                                                                          Foreign investment won't return to Lebanon until Westernhostages believed held by pro-Iranian groups are freed, aBritish official said in Beirut. &quot;Clearly what this countryneeds is investment, confidence, people coming back to investhere,&quot; British Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg said.Twelve Westerners are missing in Lebanon, including threeBritons. Mr. Hogg is the most senior British official tovisit Lebanon in six years.                                                                                                          BRAZIL-SOVIET SATELLITE PROJECT                                                                                                          A Brazilian-Soviet consortium wants to launch commercialsatellites from Brazil, but Brasilia officials are dividedover the plan because of U.S. objections aboutadvanced-technology transfer. If the project is approved,Brazil could compete with the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's commercial operations in the U.S. and theEuropean Space Agency's base in French Guyana for a share ofthe multibillion-dollar satellite launching business.President Fernando Collor de Mello may announce a decisionafter talks in the U.S. next week.                                                                                                          SOVIET-CUBAN TRADE RESTORED                                                                                                          Soviet-Cuban trade, halted since January except for oilshipments to Havana, is being restored under a barter accord,a Soviet news agency said. Neither side has convertiblecurrency. Bilateral trade was suspended when financiallystrapped Moscow demanded convertible currency for itsexports. Soviet oil, food, wood and machinery parts will betraded for Cuban sugar and other food products.                                                                                                          AIRBUS REPAYMENTS TO RISE                                                                                                          The partners of Airbus Industrie, the European aircraftconsortium, will repay a total of $900 million to theirgovernments this year, up from $500 million in 1990. Therepayments are made against the advances France, Germany,Britain and Spain made to launch Airbus. The partners areAerospatiale, the Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm unit ofDaimler-Benz AG, British Aerospace PLC and ConstruccionesAeronauticas S.A.                                                                                                          EC STATES WARNED ON PROGRESS                                                                                                          The European Community Commission warned that ECgovernments are holding up progress in the final stages ofthe 1992 single-market plan.   In a biannual progress report, the commission accused theEC Council of Ministers, the legislative institution thatrepresents EC member states, of procrastination in adoptingkey 1992 proposals.   Of 282 single-market legislative measures, 89 remain to beadopted and implemented before Dec. 31, 1992. In the past sixmonths, the council has passed only 11. Once passed, mostmeasures must be incorporated into national law, which oftentakes as long as two years. This means substantial parts ofthe single market are unlikely to be in place on time, atleast in some member states. But the writing of 1992directives into national law is advancing at a faster pace.Of the measures adopted, about 72% have been implemented bynational parliaments, up from 67% in November.   With noncontroversial items adopted, the EC is stuck ondisputed proposals such as abolishing intra-EC border checkson travelers and luggage, and agreeing on common indirect taxrates.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          State-owned Air France said that after a six-yearsuspension of flights to Beirut, it will resume scheduledservice June 26, the first Western airline to do so since thecivil war ended. . . . Taipei ordered a crackdown on bettingon the opening and closing prices of Taiwan stock prices. Aregulator said some gamblers have tried to manipulate stockprices by buying and selling large blocks of shares.</TEXT></DOC>
