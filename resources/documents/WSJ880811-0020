The action also charges that some former and current officers and directors used inside information to trade the company's stock for their own profit and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the company.    The suit seeks class-action status.    A company executive declined to comment.    In July, Webb said it received an unsolicited $17.50-a-share takeover proposal from a new partnership formed by a Newport Beach, Calif., real estate developer and a Los Angeles real estate lawyer. The offer, from ESA Associates LP, had an indicated value of about $161 million, based on Webb's 9.2 million shares outstanding.    However, earlier this month, ESA Associates let its takeover bid expire but said that didn't mean that it wasn't still interested. Webb said it hadn't responded by the deadline set by ESA because it hadn't been provided with information it requested about the partnership.    The latest suit charges that the defendants have acted to block takeovers of the company and to permanently entrench themselves. It charges that the company implemented a shareholders rights plan that is actually a &quot;poison pill&quot; plan that makes it almost impossible for anyone to acquire more than 15% of Webb's stock.    The latest suit also charges that 11 current and former officers and directors sold Webb shares with the knowledge that the company planned to announce that it was going to discontinue its dividend.    The suit also charges that before the company announced that it would discontinue its dividend, the defendants authorized or participated in making a number of false and misleading statements resulting in an artificially high stock price.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Webb shares closed at $13.25, down 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
