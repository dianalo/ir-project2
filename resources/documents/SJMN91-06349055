How can I best create a cozy cornerthat will include these elements?;   A It's easy -- all that's needed is a bitof imagination. Since I've never seen your home, I have to make a fewassumptions.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CONVERT CORNER TO A WRITING HIDEAWAY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Interiors; Rita St. Clair is the founder and head of a Baltimore, Md.,-basedinterior design company.  </MEMO><TEXT>     For starters, I'll suppose that you are able to rearrange the furniture injust about any room, maybe even a hallway. A small writing desk, chair andbookcase can be made to fit in almost any small space -- under a stairway, forexample.;   Surely somewhere in your home it's possible to clear a cornerthat's at least three feet wide and two feet deep. That's all the spacerequired for a wonderful little desk or a built-in writing shelf with a coupleof drawers. A bookcase could then be added on one of the open sides of thecorner.;   Another possibility is to carve out an adjoining area, perhaps acloset, where the bookcase can be installed. In the photo, shelves were builtinto a wall beside the eaves of a house, which makes a cozy nook indeed.;  Once you've decided on the location and the furniture layout, you need toembellish the space to suit your stylistic preferences. To me, the idealwriting corner is dark but not dingy, and full of texture and pattern. Themodel I've chosen meets those specifications.;   If you're lucky enough tohave a richly grained writing table, don't be afraid you'll interfere with itsdesign if you use patterned wallpaper. Just be careful not to select somethinggarish or over-scaled. Small prints, small stripes and coordinated bordersproduce enough contrast to make this corner a beautiful accent area in anyroom.;   Here, the walls under the eaves are covered with papers in variousdesigns found in the Sunworthy wall-covering book, &quot;Small Prints.&quot;;   I alsowouldn't hesitate to choose something dramatic as the covering for the chair.The sort of arabesque patterns seen in Persian rugs come to mind.;   Ifdesigned with taste and flair, such a corner may turn out to be more than justcozy. It could even qualify as the most sophisticated and exotic part of yourhome.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Rita St. Clair column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911214  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  410  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, December 14, 199100349055,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
