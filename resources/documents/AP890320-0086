Richard G. Austin, acting GSA administrator, said the decisionwas preliminary until GSA conducts a further analysis aboutlicensing a pay phone company.   He said the GSA's decision would not prevent the agency fromselecting a long-distance carrier other than ATandamp;T or pay phonecompanies other than the Bell companies at a future date.   GSA's decision was in response to an order in October by U.S.District Judge Harold Greene under which the owners of premiseswhere Bell pay phones are located must decide by April 1 whichlong-distance carriers to use. If they don't make a choice, theywill be assigned to a long-distance carrier by lottery.   Greene's order was part of his supervision of the breakup of ATandamp;Tin 1984. ATandamp;T now has a monopoly on long-distance calls from Bellpay telephones, and Greene said other companies should get a chanceto compete for the $2 billion in long-distance revenues generatedeach year from the nation's 1.5 million pay phones.   The calls in question are those made by dialing ``0'' plus thelong-distance number and either using an operator to charge the callto a home phone, to make it a collect call or use a credit card.   Long-distance carriers pay commissions to the businesses wherethe pay phones are located. GSA said it received $399,156 in suchcommissions in 1988. It said it expects to receive about $663,000for the federal treasury this year because of increases in thecommission rate.</TEXT></DOC>
