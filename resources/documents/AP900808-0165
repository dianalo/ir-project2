(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state judge on Wednesday set Oct.9 for the obscenity trial of three members of the rap music group 2Live Crew.   Broward County Circuit Judge June Johnson set the date afterrescinding bench warrants issued earlier in the day because thedefendants' attorneys didn't appear for a docket hearing. Theattorneys, contacted by the court, appeared later and told thejudge they hadn't been notified of the hearing.   County sheriff's deputies arrested 2 Live Crew leader LutherCampbell and member Chris Wongwon after a June concert inHollywood, Fla., at which the rappers sang sexually explicit lyricsfrom their ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album. The record had beenruled obscene U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez.   A third member, Mark Ross, was charged later in the case. Thegroup has four members.   Each of the three defendants is charged with one count ofmisdemeanor obscenity, and faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000fine.   The album has stirred the debate on obscenity and free speech.   An Indiana judge last week ruled that the million-selling albumviolates standards of decency and should not be sold to minors, andDallas prosecutors filed charges against two store chains forselling it. The record has also been banned from record stores inSan Antonio.</TEXT></DOC>
