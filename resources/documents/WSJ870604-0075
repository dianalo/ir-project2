The Labor Office said that 8.3% of the labor force was unemployed in May, down from 8.5% a year earlier and 8.8% in April. But officials of the office, as well as private economists, traced the decline from April to seasonal factors and not to a fundamental improvement in the job market.    Most experts have abandoned predictions that the average unemployment rate in 1987 will drop to well below last year's 9%.    The U.S., which is pressing Germany to spur economic growth so that it imports more, has often cited unemployment, which has long been a blemish on the government's economic record, as one reason the Bonn government should introduce stimulative measures. At the Venice summit of the seven largest industrial democracies June 8-10, the U.S. is expected to continue that pressure. Germany is expected to continue to resist.    Only last month, a German spokesman asserted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government was &quot;realistically optimistic&quot; that more hiring would work to reduce unemployment this year.    &quot;We were all expecting a more favorable economic development for 1987. But this calculation hasn't yet been realized,&quot; said Heinrich Franke, president of the labor agency. He referred to &quot;significant indications of a flattening in (economic) growth since the end of last year&quot; as the reason behind stubborn jobless levels.    Economists widely expect 1987 West German economic growth of between 1% and just under 2%, slowing from 2.4% economic expansion in 1986. They also see little scope for substantial drops in unemployment totals.    Earlier this week, the government, citing data-processing problems, announced it was delaying the release of figures for first-quarter gross national product until after the Venice summit. Private economists and government officials have predicted GNP will show a contraction from the 1986 fourth quarter.    &quot;The general economic picture in Germany simply leaves no room for a better job market,&quot; contended Horst Seidler, senior economist at the German Institute for Economic Research in West Berlin, one of the five institutes regularly submitting economic forecasts to the Bonn government. </TEXT></DOC>
