The battle over the gun law dominated a campaign that alsoproduced a close race between George Bush and Michael Dukakis forMaryland's 10 electoral votes. Late opinion polls showed thepresidential contest too close to call.   Democratic Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes was a strong favorite to win athird term against Republican Alan L. Keyes. The eight incumbentmembers of the House of Representatives were also favored to winre-election. 6-2.</TEXT><TEXT>   The gun law, passed last April, set up a nine-member boardappointed by the governor to prepare a list of handguns that couldbe sold in the state. Maryland gun groups, with the backing of theNational Rifle Association, collected enough petition signatures toforce a referendum on the law.   The bill was intended to ban Saturday Night Specials, cheaphanduns that supporters of the law say are often used by streetcriminals and young teen-agers.   Faced with early polls showing that almost 80 percent of votersfavored the law, the NRA mounted a $4-million-plus campaign toconvince Marylanders that the board could ban sales of all handguns,a claim hotly disputed by supporters.   Backers of the law had only about one-tenth as much money tospend as the NRA, and by Election Day their early lead in the pollshad all but evaporated.   Both sides said the outcome in Maryland could affect the futureof gun control efforts nationally.   ``Either way it goes, it's going to have some impacts in otherstates,'' said Richard Gaardiner, an NRA counsel in Washington.   Michael Beard of the National Coalition to Ban Handguns calledthe referendum ``the most significant vote in the last five to 10years'' on gun control.</TEXT></DOC>
