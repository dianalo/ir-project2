On Friday, an NMR diagnostic center officially opened inBel Air, Md. It is the first new center for the company since1987.</LP><TEXT>   By next April, the company plans to have two more magneticresonance imaging centers in the Chicago area to complementan existing one. Only one of the two new Chicago area centerswas previously announced.   Friday's opening of a 13th NMR center in Bel Air is a&quot;kick-off of the company's business plan to expand and growthe company&quot; after a period of consolidation, Joseph GuyDasti, NMR president and chief executive officer, said in aninterview.   He said the Bel Air and two additional Chicago MRI centerswill mean revenue probably will increase to about $24 millionin the year ending April 1, 1993, from the $18 million thecompany expects to register in fiscal 1992.   The three centers' impact on net income in fiscal 1993&quot;all depends on how fast we can recapture start-up costs,&quot;the executive said. But he expects the centers to have a&quot;positive impact&quot; on the bottom line by the end of fiscal1993.   Mr. Dasti also said the company is interested inacquisitions, and may purchase as many as 18 centers in twoyears. He added that the company will take advantage ofregulations that mean doctors' majority stakes in MRIdiagnostic centers, in some circumstances, have to be shed.That is leading to a consolidation in the industry, he said.   Mr. Dasti said NMR is looking at 30 to 35 potentialacquisition situations involving companies that own one ormore centers. He said the company is interested in strongdiagnostic centers and doesn't &quot;want to buy any turnarounds.&quot;   He said that any acquisitions might be funded by acombination of cash and stock.&quot;We expect to be aggressive inthe acquisition area,&quot; Mr. Dasti added.   In fiscal 1992, the company expects net of about $1.8million, up from $1.2 million in the prior year. In the firstsix months of the currentl year, the company posted net of$1,129,000 compared with $785,000 in the year-ago period.Revenue was $7.8 million compared with $8.4 million.   Mr. Dasti said the company had anticipated flat revenuethis year because of its unchanged number of centers untilFriday's opening in Maryland.   NMR owns a minimum of 60% of each of its centers, wherepatients are referred for diagnostic tests. NMR also managesand staffs the centers, and currently has 140 employees onits payroll, 26 at its corporate headquarters.</TEXT></DOC>
