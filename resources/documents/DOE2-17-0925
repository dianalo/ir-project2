Different kinds of temporary fire stoppings made of ventilationcloth, such as those reinforced by wooden boards, elastic bands and ropesare discussed. A parachute type fire stopping with a surface area of80 m{sup 2} and 40 kN total strength is presented. Its shroud lines areprovided with hooks and can be attached at roadway support elements.Another type shown is a set of three inflatable barriers: one 400 cmx 350 cm, one 310 cm x 270 cm and one for the LP-6 arched support. Stoppingsmade of boards, logs or bricks can be used as final isolating barriers.The purpose of the explosion-proof barriers is to localize effects ofmethane or fire-gas explosions and they can be made in the form of stowingplugs or made of gypsum plaster (2.0-3.5 m thick). The SPSR 2 gypsumplaster applicator with a capacity of 5-6 t/h can be used in the lattercase. A fire dam can also be produced by filling a suitable deeper lyingroadway segment with water and thus forming a water plug. Explosion-proofdams can have auxiliary elements such as additional barriers with built-inpipes or swinging steel baffles for shock wave containment. Barriersmade by hydraulic stowing are superior to other types as they can bebuilt quickly and from a distance. 9 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
