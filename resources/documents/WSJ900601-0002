Thrift industry groups immediately criticized thesuggestion, arguing that the dividend payments are importantto the struggling industry's earnings. Last year, the homeloan banks paid about $800 million to $900 million individends to solvent thrifts, Martin Regalia, an economistwith the National Council of Savings Institutions estimated,while those thrifts overall had losses of $86 million for theyear.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Clearly the dividends are an important contribution tokeeping the industry healthy,&quot; he said. The government is inthe process of closing and selling off hundreds of insolventsavings and loans. To obtain advances from the home loanbanks, thrifts are required to buy stock in the banks, which,in turn, pay dividends back to the thrifts.   The Treasury's suggestion came in a study ofgovernment-sponsored enterprises. Though the home loan bankshaven't lost money on an advance to any thrift, thedepartment said that &quot;certain banks have exposure to failedand failing thrifts.&quot; The study suggested reducing thedividend payments to increase the home loan banks' capital orfor establishing a &quot;modest&quot; loan-loss reserve.   A spokesman for the Federal Housing Finance Board, theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development agency thatoversees the home loan bank system, said the need to increaseretained earnings has to be balanced &quot;against the need tomaintain a market rate of return on members' investedcapital.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
