Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from April 11, 1988 through April 22, 1988. The last biweeklynotice was published on April 20, 1988 (53 FR 13010). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules and Procedures Branch,Division of Rules and Records, Office of Administration and Resource Management,U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should citethe publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room 4000, Maryland National Bank Building, 7735 Old Georgetown Road,Bethesda, Maryland from 8:15 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Copies of written commentsreceived may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 1717 H Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By June 3, 1988 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW.,Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during thelast ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitionerpromptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to WesternUnion at (800) 325-6000 (in Missouri (800) 342-6700). The Western Unionoperator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the followingmessage addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel-White Flint, U.S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the localpublic document room for the particular facility involved. <ITAG tagnum="84">Arizona Public Service Company, et al, Docket No. STN 50-530, PaloVerde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 3, Maricopa County, Arizona </ITAG><T3>Date of Amendment Request: </T3>April 7, 1988 <T3>Description of Amendment: </T3>The proposed amendment would modifythe Technical Specifications (Appendix A to Facility Operating LicenseNo. NPF-74, for PVNGS, Unit 3), to revise Figure 3.1-1 limits on the ModeratorTemperature Coefficient (MTC). The proposed amendment would increase thenegative MTC limit from -30 pcm/anddegrees; F to -35 pcm/anddegrees; F. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensees have provided a discussion of the proposed change as it relatesto these standards; the discussion is presented below. <T3>Standard 1 - Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequencesof an Accident Previously Evaluated </T3> The proposed change will not increase the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The TS limit is set by the steam linebreak design basis accident. Since the proposed value of -35 pcm/anddegrees;F is the same value assumed in the analysis, the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated will not be increased. <T3>Standard 2 - Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of AccidentFrom any Accident Previously Evaluated </T3> The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The MTC only affectscore response, therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any previously evaluated will not be created. <T3>Standard 3 - Involve a Significant Reduction in a Margin of Safety</T3> The proposed change will not reduce a margin of safety as defined in theTS. The basis for the MTC limit is to ensure that the assumptions usedin the safety analyses remain valid through each fuel cycle. The currentMTC limit of -30 pcm/anddegrees; F in the Unit 3 TS was required to compensatefor the as-built safety injection drain line configuration. Subsequently,the drain lines were reconfigured so that the MTC limit of -35 pcm/anddegrees;F that was assumed in the safety analyses would be valid. Therefore, increasingthe MTC limit from -30 pcm/anddegrees; F to -35 pcm/anddegrees; F does notreduce the margin of safety defined in the Technical Specifications. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensees' analysis. Accordingly, the Commission has proposed to determine that the above changedoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Phoenix Public Library, Businessand Science Division, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 <T3>Attorney for licensees: </T3>Mr. Arthur C.

The proposed amendmentwould change paragraph 3.F of Facility Operating License No. DPR-23 toadd a new license condition to Facility Operating License No. DPR-23 torequire compliance with the revised plans. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 27817 and 27822), the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission amended Part 73 of its regulations, ``Physical Protection ofPlants and Materials,'' to clarify plant security requirements to affordan increased assurance of plant safety. The amended regulations requiredthat each nuclear reactor power licensee submit proposed amendments toits security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55.The licensee submitted its revised plan on November 26, 1986 and September23, 1987, to satisfy the requirements of the amended regulations. The Commissionproposes to amend the license to reference the revised plan. In the supplementary materials accompanying the amended regulations theCommission indicated that it was amending its regulations ``to providea more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the currentlevels of protection'' and that the ``Commission believes that the clarificationand refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is [sic]appropriate because they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.''The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether or not a no significant hazards considerationexists by providing certain examples of actions not likely to involve significanthazards considerations and examples of actions likely to involve significanthazards considerations (51 FR 7750). One of the examples of actions notlikely to involve significant hazards considerations is example (vii) ``achange to conform a license to changes in the regulations, where the licensechange results in very minor changes to facility operations clearly inkeeping with the regulations.'' The changes in this case fall within thescope of the example. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission proposesto determine that the proposed amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Hartsville Memorial Library,Home and Fifth Avenues, Hartsville, South Carolina 29535 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R.

Miller, Esq., Sidley and Austin,One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60603. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Daniel R. Muller <ITAG tagnum="84">Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-254 and 50-265, Quad CitiesNuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, Rock Island County, Illinois </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>March 28, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.90, CommonwealthEdison Company (CECo, the licensee) proposed an amendment of Facility OperatingLicense DPR-30 in order to provide for Cycle 10 operation of Quad CitiesNuclear Power Station (QCNPS), Unit 2. The Unit 2 Reload 9/Cycle 10 replacement reactor fuel is of the GE8X8EBextended burnup fuel design, which has several different mechanical andnuclear features than existing Cycle 9 fuel. The GE8X8EB fuel design, asdescribed in Topical Report NEDE-24011-P-A, ``General Electric StandardApplication for Reactor Fuel'', has been reviewed and approved by the NRCfor generic applications and extended burnup operations. Utilization ofGE8X8EB fuel was previously approved for QCNPS, Unit 1, and other non-CECoplants (e.g., Fitzpatrick, Peach Bottom, Limerick, and Millstone). This reload was performed by General Electric (GE) using their new advancedcomputer modeling methods. These new methods are known as the GEMINI methodsand replace the old GENESIS methods. Furthermore, the impact of the newfuel type upon Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) analysis was evaluatedwith GE's SAFER/GESTR-LOCA methods rather than the SAFE/REFLOOD LOCA methods.The GEMINI and SAFER/GESTR-LOCA methods were also used for the Unit 1 Cycle10 reload. In general, the proposed license amendment would delete a certain licensecondition and revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to incorporate newCycle 10 reload fuel operating limits, expand operating domains (includingoperation with equipment out of service), and make editorial corrections.Similar license and TS changes have already been issued for Unit 1 (i.e.Amendment No. 103, dated December 15, 1987). These TS changes specificallyrelated to the Unit 2 Cycle 10 reload fuel operating limits and analyses,as derived from the improved analytical methodologies mentioned above,are as follows: 1. Incorporation of the Cycle 10 Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) limitand associated 20% insertion scram time 2. Addition of Maximum Average Planar Linear Heat Generation Rate (MAPLHGR)limits for the reload fuel. 3. Addition of an Linear Heat Generation Rate (LHGR) limit specific tothe GE8X8EB fuel. 4. Increasing the rod block monitor (RBM) setpoint. 5. Reduction of the MCPR fuel cladding safety limit from 1.07 to 1.04 asgenerically approved by the NRC for this type of fuel. The TS changes resulting from analysis performed to expand the operatingregion and allow operation with certain equipment out-of-service include:6. Changes to the analyzed operating region to include increased core flow(ICF) and feedwater temperature reduction (FTR). 7. Revision of the Automatic Pressure Relief Subsystem Technical Specificationto require action only after two or more relief valves are found to beinoperable. 8. Deletion of the license operating restriction for coastdown to 40% powerand coastdown with off-normal FW heating. And TS changes which are administrative or editorial in nature include:9. Updating references to reflect new analytical methods and models (e.g.,GEMINI, SAFER/GESTR-LOCA, etc.) 10. Clarifying the Bases for the Automatic Pressure Relief function. 11. Incorporating Regulatory Guide 1.49 into Bases for analyzing ratedthermal power conditions. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The licensee's reload analysis was performed by GE, who used the advancedGEMINI licensing methodology to technically justify Cycle 10 operation.This generic methodology has been previously reviewed and considered acceptableby the NRC staff. Also, included as part of the reload submittal were allassociated transient and accident analyses for the following EquipmentOut-of-Service and Extended Operating Domain operating modes (EOOS/EOD):increased core flow, feedwater heater(s) out-of-service, feedwater temperaturereduction, relief valve out-of-service, and single loop operation. Allcore wide transients and ECCS analyses were performed with the most restrictiverelief valve out-of-service (RVOOS), i.e., the Target Rock S/RV. Therefore,the reload package has incorporated additional changes to allow unrestrictedoperation with only one relief valve out-of-service. GE has also reanalyzed the design basis Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA)event at QCNPS with an improved ECCS computer code package called SAFER/GESTR-LOCAApplication Methodology. Results from this analysis of postulated plantLOCAs was provided by CECo in accordance with NRC requirements to demonstratethat QCNPS conforms with the ECCS and Peak Cladding Temperature (PCT) acceptancecriteria of 10 CFR 50.46 and Appendix K. As such, SAFER/GESTR-LOCA Lossof Coolant Analysis (NEDC-31345P dated July 1987) is now considered theprimary ECCS licensing basis reference for QCNPS. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists. As stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. Pursuant with 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided thefollowing evaluation of their amendment application addressing these threestandards. CECo has evaluated the proposed Technical Specifications and License Conditionschanges, and determined that they do not represent a significant hazardsconsideration. Based on the criteria for defining a significant hazardsconsideration established in 10 CFR 50.92(c), operation of QCNPS Unit 2Cycle 10 in accordance with the proposed changes will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previouslyevaluated because MCPR, LHGR, and MAPLHGR core operating limits are providedto establish bounds on normal reactor operations which ensure core conditionsare maintained within the assumptions and scope of accident analyses. NewMAPLHGR curves and, LHGR and MCPR limits are provided for each and everyreload to accurately reflect changes in the reactor fuel configuration.Operation within these limits will assure the consequences of affectedtransients and accidents remain within the results and bounds of safetyanalyses. MAPLHGR and MCPR curves/limits were generated using aforementionedanalytical methods previously approved by the NRC. The LHGR limit for GE8X8EBfuel was calculated using the GESTR-MECHANICAL code (a fuel rod thermal-mechanicalperformance model considered acceptable by the NRC). Results from GESTR-MECHANICALdemonstrate that compliance with the new LHGR limit (in concert with appropriateMAPLHGR curves) will further ensure fuel design basis criteria are satisfiedfor GE8X8EB fuel. Cycle specific rod withdrawal error analysis conductedby GE, demonstrates the consequences of an accident are not affected byan increased rod block reading of 108%. This is because the resultant eventMCPR, as bound by the proposed MCPR TS limit, and LHGRs remain within thedesign basis. Furthermore, Core Operating Limits and RBM setpoint changesdo not affect any physical system or equipment which could increase theprobability of an accident. Proposed changes to increase the allowable operating region (i.e. EOOS/EOD),including coastdown to 20% and coastdown with off-normal FW heating, havebeen analyzed by GE (using NRC approved methods) to determine applicableoperating restrictions (MCPR, MAPLHGR). GE demonstrated that the consequencesof changes to the allowable operating region are bound by the proposedvalues for MCPR and MAPLHGR. Furthermore, the probability of an accidentis not increased because operation in the expanded region does not significantlyalter the normal operation of the equipment, for which failures have beenpreviously analyzed. All cycle transient and LOCA analyses were performedassuming the most limiting RVOOS. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated because proposed MCPR, MAPLHGR, and LHGRlimits, and RBM setpoint represent limitations on core power distributionwhich do not directly affect the operation or function of any system orcomponent. Expanded operating regions (including EOOS) represent changesto the core power and flow distribution, but do not significantly affectthe operation or function of any system or component. Operating limitswere established by analyses to bound all combinations of specified EOOS/EODwithin acceptable analyzed conditions to ensure fuel integrity and ECCScriteria. Consequently, there is no significant impact on or addition toany system or equipment whose failure could initiate an accident. The majorcomponent affected (i.e., by ICF and FTR) is the recirculation pumps whosefailure has been previously analyzed. Also, GE assumed operation with themost limiting relief valve out-of-service in the transient and LOCA analyses.Therefore, this condition has been analyzed and no new or different accidentsare created. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because allof the proposed changes have been analyzed to demonstrate that the consequencesof transients or accidents are not increased beyond those already evaluatedand accepted by the NRC for QCNPS. Furthermore, the fuel used in Cycle10 is very similar to that used in previous Unit 2 cycles and the corewill be operated in essentially the same manner. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation related to the Cycle10 changes and concurs with their conclusions. In addition, the Commissionhas provided guidance concerning application of 10 CFR 50.92 standardsfor determining whether a no significant hazards consideration exists byproviding certain examples (51 FR 7751). The amendment proposed hereinrelating to Cycle 10 operation is representative of example (iii). Thespecific license changes are associated with a reload, where no fuel assembliessignificantly different from those found previously acceptable to the NRCfor a previous core at QCNPS are used, no significant changes have beenmade to the acceptance criteria for the TS, and the methods used (althoughchanged from the previous cycle) have been found previously acceptableby the NRC staff. Additonally, the administrative and editorial TS changesidentified above are considered representative of example (i), which isdefined as ``a purely administrative change to TS; for example, a changeto achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications, correctionof an error, or change in nomenclature.'' Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that this amendment requestdoes not involve significant hazards considerations based upon a preliminaryreview of the reload submittal, the licensee's evaluation of no significanthazards, and NRC guidance. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Dixon Public Library, 221Hennepin Avenue, Dixon, Illinois 61021. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael Miller, Esquire, Sidley and Austin,One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60603. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Daniel R.

A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has determined, and the Commission agrees, that the proposedchanges to the Technical Specifications: (1) Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The changes provide an alternativefrequency and means of verification of primary and secondary containmentpenetration isolation which still provide assurance that required conditionsare maintained.

Specifically, the TS would be revised to: (1) Delete TS Table 3.7-4a ``Safety-Related Hydraulic Snubbers - ITT Grinnell''and TS Table 3.7-4b ``Safety-Related Mechanical Snubbers - Pacific Scientific.''(2) Modify TS 3.7.8 which currently reads, ``All snubbers listed in Tables3.7-4a and 3.7-4b shall be operable.'' to read ``All snubbers shall beoperable. The only snubbers excluded from the requirements are those installedon non-safety related systems and then only if the failure of the systemon which they are installed would not have an adverse effect on any safetyrelated system.'' (3) Delete the references to TS Tables 3.7-4a and 3.7-4b in TS 4.7.8.band TS 6.10.2.k. (4) Revise the Bases of TS 3/4.7.8 ``Snubbers'' to delete the requirementto list exempted snubbers in Tables 3.7-4a and 3.7-4b. (5) Add the following statement to Surveillance Specification 4.7.8.e ``FunctionalTesting'': ``The large bore steam generator hydraulic snubbers shall betested as a separate population for functional test purposes. A 10% randomsample from previously untested snubbers shall be tested at least onceper refueling outage with continued testing based on failure evaluation.Once the whole population has been subjected to functional testing, thetesting sequence shall begin anew by random selection based on the totalpopulation.'' <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>In GL 84-13 the Commission concluded that snubbers need not be listedwithin the TS provided the TS is modified to specify which snubbers arerequired to be operable. GL 84-13 provided model specifications for useby licensees requesting such changes. The model retains the recordkeepingrequirements of current specifications. The Commission also noted thatsince any changes in snubber quantities, types, or locations would be achange to the facility, such changes would be subject to the provisionsof 10 CFR Part 50.59 and would be reflected in the licensee's records (asrequired by McGuire TS 6.10.2k). The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 by providing certain examples (51 FR 7750). Oneof the examples (ii) of actions not likely to involve a significant hazardsconsideration is a change that constitutes an additional restriction orcontrol not presently included in the TS. The proposed change (item 5 above)to supplement surveillance specification 4.7.8e to add a requirement forfunctional testing of large bore steam generator hydraulic snubbers matchesthis example and the McGuire TS does not currently require these hydraulicsnubbers to be tested. The remaining proposed changes (items 1 through 4 above) do not match theexamples in 51 FR 7750. However, the staff has reviewed the licensee'srequest for amendments and has determined that it follows the Commission'sguidance in GL 84-13. The amendments would not result in a change to theactual systems or design of the systems as installed with respect to snubbers.Limitations, restrictions and surveillances presently in the TS would notbe adversely affected. The same snubbers presently required to be operablewould continue to be required operable (i.e, although the specific listingof snubbers would be deleted from the TS, the revised TS would, nevertheless,specify that all snubbers are to be operable except those installed onnon-safety related systems whose failure would not adversely affect anysafety-related system). Therefore, the changes, if implemented, would not:(1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated or (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

By a March 3, 1987 letter,the licensee revised the original application. The revisions affect onlyPart C of TS 3.9.4 Chemical Treatment Ponds (CTP 1 and 2). The Bases of the Oconee TS state that the inventory limits (of TS 3.9.4)for the Chemical Treatment Ponds are based on minimizing the consequencesof an uncontrolled release of the pond inventory. The current Part C ofTS 3.9.4 provides that the quantity of radioactive material per transferredbatch of used powdex resin averaged over the transfers of the previous13 weeks shall not exceed 0.01% of the pond radionuclide inventory limit.The proposed amendments would delete this requirement and substitute arequirement that the total quantity of radioactive material of all batchesof used powdex resin transferred to CTPs over the previous 13 weeks shallnot exceed 0.4% of the pond radionuclide limit. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR Part 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated, or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The intent of Part C of Oconee TS 3.9.4 is to limit the quantities of radioactivematerials transferred to the Chemical Treatment Ponds in order to ensurethat the total inventory limit in the ponds is not exceeded over the lifeof the nuclear station. The current Part C limits only the average quantitiesof radioactive materials per batch of powdex resin transferred over thespecified 13 week period. There is no limit on the total quantities transferredto the ponds during these time periods. The March 3, 1987 revised submittalwould limit the total quantity of radioactive materials transferred tothe ponds during these time periods, but would not limit the average quantityper batch, as in the current Part C. Conservatively assuming a uniforminput level at 0.4% of the pond inventory limit each 13 week period andno radioactive decay, no more than 48% of the pond total inventory limitwill be accumulated in the ponds over the remaining 30 year life of OconeeNuclear Station under the proposed revision. Therefore, the proposed action would not (1) Involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated, or (3) Involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety.

The licensee, in its February 9, 1988 submittal, provided the followingevaluation of the proposed change with regard to these three standards:<ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change will result in a description identical to thatprovided in NRC approved BWR Standard Technical Specifications (NUREG 0123Revision 3) for this common BWR design feature.

Specifically, the Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR)and the maximum average planar linear heat generation rate (MAPLHGR) limtswill be changed. It would also permit the use of GE8X8EB fuel. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). The licensee has determined and the NRC staff agrees that the proposedamendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequenceof an accident previously evaluated. The probability of an accident isnot dependent upon the core loading and there are no other changes to theplant configuration, availability of safety systems, the manner in whichthe safety systems are initiated or the way the plant is operated thatwill increase the probability of an accident. Cycle 12 introduces a newfuel design, GE8X8EB, which has been reviewed and approved by the NRC;letter from H. Berkow (NRC) to J. S. Charnley (GE) dated December 3, 1985,``Acceptance for Approval of Fuel Designs Described in Licensing TopicalReport NEDE-24011-P-A-6, Amendment 10 for Extended Burnup Operation.''The fuel design has been incorporated into the reload applications of otherBWR plants. The neutronic and mechanical design is not significantly differentfrom designs currently in use at Oyster Creek and the fuel will not beoperated in a manner that would cause the consequences of an accident tobe increased. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated. The Cycle 12 core loading does not involve any otherchange to the plant configuration, nor does it change the availabilityof safety systems or the manner in which they respond to initiating events.Also, the design does not change the manner in which the core will be operatedfrom previous cycles. As such, the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any previously evaluated is not created. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposedTechnical Specifications are based on analysis results which were performedin accordance with methods and procedures developed by GPUN and GE. TheGPUN methods have been submitted to the NRC for their review and approval.NRC approval requires GPUN to demonstrate the adequacy of the methods forthe analyses to be performed, that the methods account for the uncertaintiesin the analyses, and that GPUN can adequately employ the methods for theirapplication. All of the methods used by GPUN have been submitted to theNRC and have been approved except for TR-045 which is under review andaddresses system transients using the RETRAN-02 computer code. NRC approvalof TR-045 is expected since the methods employed have been used by otherutilities in similar applications, the methods account for uncertaintiesand the methods provide results which are consistent with previous reloadanalyses. Currently, the RETRAN-02 code itself is being reviewed by theNRC for use in reload analyses. The GE LOCA analyses, NEDE-31462P, ``Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating StationSAFER/CORECOOL/GESTR-LOCA LOSS-OF-COOLANT ACCIDENT ANALYSIS,'' submittedwith this reload application is based on a methodology previously approvedby the NRC via a May 11, 1987 safety evaluation addressing NEDE-30996-P,Volume II. This methodology has been used by other utilities in reloadapplications, and, as in the case of TR-045, NRC approval of the OysterCreek application is expected. Therefore, the results of the analyses presented in TR-049 and NEDE-31462Pand the technical specification changes based on these results will ensurethat there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety. Accordingly, the staff has made a proposed determination that the applicationfor amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Ocean County Library, ReferenceDepartment, 101 Washington Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Ernest L.

The amended regulations requiredthat each nuclear power reactor licensee submit proposed amendments toits security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55.The licensee submitted its revised plan on December 2, 1986, and December17, 1987, to satisfy the requirements of the amended regulations. The Commissionproposes to amend the license to reference the revised plan. In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, theCommission indicated that it was amending its regulations ``to providea more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the currentlevels of protection'' and that the ``Commission believes that the clarificationand refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is appropriatebecause they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.'' The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations and examples of actions involving significant hazards considerations(51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involving no significanthazards considerations is example (vii) ``a change to conform a licenseto changes in the regulations, where the license change results in veryminor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.''The changes in this case fall within the scope of the example.

The licensee has determined and the NRC staff agrees that the proposedamendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofany accident previously evaluated. The proposed change would require the implementation of the IIS methodologydescribed in the Program Plan. As such, it requires that NNECO establishan administrative means for tracking, prioritizing, and scheduling NRCrequired plant modifications and engineering evaluations, and licenseeidentified plant improvement projects. This methodology is intended toenhance plant safety by more effectively controlling the number and schedulingof plant modifications, thereby assuring that issues required for safeoperation of the plant receive priority and are complete in a timely manner.Because the license condition addresses only an administrative schedulingmechanism, it does not affect directly the design or operation of the plant.Therefore, no accident analyses are affected and the proposed change doesnot increase the probability or consequences of any previously evaluatedaccident. 2.

FSAR Safety Analyses for steamline break,rod ejection and bank withdrawal from subcritical (the limiting zero powertransients) assume all four reactor coolant pumps are operating as an initialcondition. A review of the steamline break and rod ejection analyses underthe reduced flow conditions of only one reactor coolant pump in operationhas demonstrated that the conclusions presented in the FSAR will not beimpacted.

Thisproposed Technical Specification change would prohibit control bank withdrawalwith less than four reactor coolant pumps in operation, thereby providingassurance that the plant is operated within the accident analysis assumptionsand that the margin of safety as defined in the FSAR analysis is not reduced.</ITAG><T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee made the following analysis of these changes: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?The proposed amendment would resolve an inconsistency between the TechnicalSpecifications and the FSAR analysis of the uncontrolled control rod withdrawalfrom a subcritical event and the number of reactor coolant pumps assumedto be in operation. By revising the Technical Specification to the moreconservative assumption used in the FSAR analyses (four reactor coolantpumps operating) or prohibiting control bank withdrawal with less thanfour RCPs operating such that an uncontrolled rod withdrawal event is precludedassures that consequences of this event are not increased and are maintainedconsistent with previous analysis. The revised requirement for operatingreactor coolant pumps will not change the probability of a rod withdrawalevent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?Insofar as the proposed change revises the Technical Specifications toconform with the more conservative assumptions employed in the FSAR SafetyAnalysis for the uncontrolled control rod withdrawal from subcritical,the proposed change constitutes an additional restriction not presentlyincluded in Technical Specifications. Prohibiting control bank withdrawalwhen less than four reactor coolant pumps are in operation between Tavg= 350anddegrees; F and hot zero power will not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety? As noted previously, the proposed amendment constitutesan additional restriction not presently included in Technical Specifications.As such, the amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety but rather an enhancement to assure the margin of safety assumedin the uncontrolled control rod withdrawal analysis is maintained. </ITAG>Based on the above, the staff purposes to determine that the proposed changesdo not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Library,100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10601 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Charles M.

C.Summer Nuclear Station Functional Organization. Specifically, Section 6.2,``Organization,'' is proposed to be modified to indicate that as resultof the planned reorganization neither the Offsite Organization nor theUnit Organization will continue to exist. With the movement onsite of allof the nuclear staff for South Carolina Electric andamp; Gas, these formerorganizations are now incorporated as the V. C. Summer Nuclear StationFunctional Organization. Figure 6.2-1 is proposed to be modified to reflectthis new organization. With the deletion of these two organizations somerenumbering of Section 6.2 of the TS is necessary. The present Section6.2.3, ``Independent Safety Engineering Group (ISEG),'' is proposed tobe modified under ``Authority,'' (TS 6.2.3.4) to indicate that the ISEGshall make recommendations to the General Manager, Nuclear Safety versusthe Group Manager, Technical Specifications in the previous organization.The ``Composition,'' (TS 6.5.1.2), of the Plant Safety Review Committeeis proposed to be changed to be consistent with the new organization. TheChairman will be either the Director, Nuclear Plant Operations or the GeneralManager, Station Operations. The other members will consist of the managersof Operations, Maintenance Services, Chemistry and Health Physics, CoreEngineering and Nuclear Computer Services, and Design Engineering and theGeneral Manager, Station Support. Section 6.5.3, ``Technical Review andControl,'' is proposed to be modified in TS 6.5.3.1.b to indicate thateach modification to plant nuclear safety-related structures, systems,and components shall now be designed under authorization from the EngineeringServices versus Technical Services in the old organization. The licensee indicated that this January 6, 1988 request is not intendedto supercede their July 8, 1987 request to delete the organizational chartsfrom the TS but is intended to ensure consistency between the TS and theStation Organization until the NRC acts upon the licensee's July 8 request.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has determined that: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe reorganization does not affect plant operation in any manner. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously evaluated because the proposed changeis administrative in nature and no physical alterations of plant configurationor changes to setpoints or operating parameters are proposed. 3.

These tests will becomeoverdue beginning December 8, 1988. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a requestfor amendment involves no significant hazards consideration as containedin the Commission's Regulations, 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment wouldnot involve a significant hazards consideration if operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The licensees have provided the following determination as to whether theproposed amendment involves a significant hazard consideration: The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The valves were all inspected successfully in early to mid 1984, and weresubsequently cleaned and installed between September 10 and November 15,1984. The turbine was first brought to rated speed using nuclear steamin December 1986. The valves will have only experienced operating conditionsfor approximately 25 months by the beginning of the first refueling outage.Therefore, in actuality, the valves will be inspected prior to accumulatingthe amount of wear presently permitted by the Technical Specification.This does not represent any increase in the probability of an accident.Since extending the first interval does nothing to the consequence of anaccident, this change will not change the consequences of an accident.Thus, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of any accidentpreviously evaluated. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Turbine overspeed protection testing of the main turbine was performedas part of the Startup Test Program. Tests including the Turbine Generatorload reject test (conducted on October 25, 1987) actually verified thatthe valves are functioning properly to prevent an unacceptable overspeedcondition in the main turbine. Since the purpose of the disassembly andinspections of the valves is to ensure that they will operate to protectthe turbine from excessive overspeed, the startup testing preformed hasverified that this is in fact the case. Therefore, no new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has been created.The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety. As stated above, the valves will actually experience less operating timebetween inspection than what is presently permitted by the Technical Specifications.Therefore, the margin of safety will not be reduced by approval of thischange request. The staff has reviewed the licensee's determination as to whether the proposedamendment involves no significant hazards considerations. The staff notesthat the requested extension interval for inspection of the turbine valvesuntil the first refueling outage is small and is not likely to have significanteffect on the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The staffalso notes that extending the interval by a small amount cannot by itselfintroduce a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.In these and other respects, the staff concurs with the licensees thatthe proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration.Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Perry Public Library, 3753Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Jay Silberg, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Pottsandamp; Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Kenneth E.

The amended regulations required that each nuclearpower reactor licensee submit proposed amendments to its security planto implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55. The licensee submittedits revised plan on January 5, 1988, to satisfy the requirements of theamended regulations. The Commission proposes to amend the license to referencethe revised plan. In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, theCommission indicated that it was amending its regulations ``to providea more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the currentlevels of protection'' and that the ``Commission believes that the clarificationand refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is appropriatebecause they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.'' The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations and examples of actions involving significant hazards considerations(51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involving no significanthazards considerations is example (vii) ``a change to conform a licenseto changes in the regulations, where the license change results in veryminor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.''The changes in this case fall within the scope of the example. For theforegoing reasons, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposedamendment involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Brooks Memorial Library,224 Main Street, Brattleboro, Vermont 05301. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>John A.

The third reload of the WashingtonPublic Power Supply System Nuclear Project No. 2 (WNP-2) will utilize AdvancedNuclear Fuels Corporation (ANF), 8x8 current fuel. The fuel design of thisreload batch is virtually identical to the fuel design of the previousreload batch. The amendment application submittal of March 7, 1988, is composed of theWNP-2 Cycle 4 Reload Summary Report (WPPSS-EANF-119), the WNP-2 Cycle 4Reload Analysis Report (XN-NF-88-02), the WNP-2 Cycle 4 Plant TransientAnalysis Report (XN-NF-88-01), and the proposed changes to the WNP-2 TechnicalSpecifications. The Reload Summary Report summarizes the reload analysesperformed by ANF in support of WNP-2 operation for Cycle 4. In addition,a description of the ANF reload is given along with a comparison of thecharacteristics of the Cycle 4 and Cycle 3 cores. The WNP-2 Cycle 4 Reload Analysis Report is intended to be used in conjunctionwith ANF Topical Report XN-NF-80-19(P)(A), Volume 4, Revision 1, Applicationof the ANF Methodology to BWR Reloads which gives a detailed descriptionof the methods and analyses utilized. The supplement of April 12, 1988, provides the pages of the Technical Specificationsshowing the revisions requested to be made by this amendment. This letteralso provided a figure which had been omitted from the WNP-2 Cycle 4 ReloadSummary Report. WNP-2 will be entering its fourth cycle of operation and is approachingan equilibrium cycle. The results of the licensees analysis show littlechange from Cycle 3 to 4. As a result, the licensee has chosen to add somesmall Critical Power Ratio (CPR) penalties for margin to envelope futureanticipated analysis results. The intent is to be able to make future fuelreloads without Technical Specification changes using instead the provisionsof 10 CFR 50.59. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The proposed amendment to the WNP-2 Technical Specifications to supportthis reload is very similar to Example (iii) provided by the Commission(51 FR 7751, March 6, 1986) of the types of amendments not likely to involvesignificant hazards considerations. Example (iii) is an amendment to reflecta core reload where: (1) No fuel assemblies are significantly different from those found previouslyacceptable to the Commission for a previous core at the facility in questionare involved; (2) No significant changes are made to the acceptance criteria for theTechnical Specifications; (3) The analytical methods used to demonstrate conformance with the TechnicalSpecifications and regulations are not significantly changed; and (4) The NRC has previously found such methods acceptable. For the third refueling outage for WNP-2, the Supply System will replace152 of the General Electric (GE) initial core fuel assemblies with ANF8x8 fuel. Twenty-four (24) of the Cycle 4 reload fuel assemblies will havea bundle average enrichment of 2.72 weight percent U235; 128 of the Cycle4 reload fuel assemblies are enriched to a bundle average value of 2.64weight percent U235. The 152 ANF 8x8C fuel bundles to be loaded for Cycle4 are similar in design to the initial core fuel and previous reload assemblies.The change in WNP-2 core loading required a partial re-analysis by ANF.The Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and the Maximum Average Planar LinearHeat Generation Rate (MAPLHGR) analyses relevant to Cycle 4 operationswere performed for all ANF fueled cores as a part of the Cycle 2 (initialreload) analysis. Relevant transient analyses and Minimum Critical PowerRatio (MCPR) analyses for the Cycle 4 loading were reported. Analyses ofnormal reactor operation consisted of evaluation of the mechanical, thermalhydraulic, and nuclear design characteristics. Operation at extended coreflow, single loop operation and final feedwater temperature reduction werealso evaluated. The use of the ANF type fuel assemblies and the associated analytical methodsused for the Cycle 4 reload analyses have been previously approved by theNRC staff for use in other boiling water reactors (BWR's). Based on theseprior reviews, the NRC staff has determined that there are only small differencesbetween the use of ANF and GE analytical methods. This core reload involves the use of fuel assemblies that are not significantlydifferent from those found acceptable to the Commission for a previouscore at this facility. The proposed amendment would change the TechnicalSpecifications to reflect new operating limits associated with the fuelto be inserted into the core based on the new core physics. In the licensee'sanalyses supporting this reload there have been no significant changesin acceptance criteria for the Technical Specifications. The licensee contendsthat their analytical methods have been found acceptable by the NRC. The only difference between this reload and Example (iii) provided by theNRC is related to the use of the ANF analytical methods which are slightlydifferent from the GE methods used for Cycle 1 and the Exxon (now ANF)methods used for Cycle 2. The licensee argues that the ANF analytical resultsare not significantly different from those found acceptable to the NRCfor the previous cores at WNP-2 and that the methods have been approvedpreviously by the staff for use in other BWR's. In addition to providing examples of amendments not likely to involve asignificant hazards consideration, the Commission has provided standardsfor determining whether no significant hazards consideration exists (10CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facilityinvolves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability of consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident froman accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. On the basis of the evaluation performed in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92,and the fact that the analytical methods used have been approved previouslyby the NRC staff and do not provide results significantly different, theSupply System has concluded, and the staff agrees, that operation of WNP-2in accordance with the proposed reload amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because the transient analyses have beenreanalyzed for the reload core. The proposed changes to the Technical Specificationsreflect new operating limits associated with the reload core, are basedon approved analysis methods and are within the current acceptance criteria;(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because the operational limitations appliedto Cycle 4 are identical to previous cycles. The values were derived fromNRC qualified codes and by applying the most limiting transients throughoutthe cycle. These limitations are sufficient to ensure the plant is operatedwithin previously accepted conditions. In addition, no changes sufficientto create a new type of malfunction are contemplated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because themargin to safety for all accidents or operational occurrences analyzedfor Cycle 4 operation is either identical to or more conservative thanthat used for previous cycles. Based on the above considerations, the Commission proposes to determinethat the requested change to the WNP-2 Technical Specifications involvesno significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland Public Library,Swift and Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorney for the Licensee: </T3>Nicholas S.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By June 3, 1988, the licensee may filea request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to thesubject facility operating license and any person whose interest may beaffected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party inthe proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requestsfor a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW.,Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during thelast ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitionerpromptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to WesternUnion at (800) 325-6000 (in Missouri (800) 342-6700).
