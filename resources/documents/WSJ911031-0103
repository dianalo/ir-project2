Congress seesunemployment benefits as a campaign issue; the president, asa threat to his budget agreement. But surely there is abetter way to address economic security than to rely on theshifting winds of politics?   Unfortunately the obvious alternative to government-rununemployment insurance -- a system of private unemploymentinsurance in which workers and their firms purchase policiesfrom insurance companies -- does not exist. While life,health, disability and retirement insurance are all providedby both the government and the private sector, unemploymentinsurance is exclusively the province of government.</LP><TEXT>   To understand how this situation arose requires somehistory. Before government unemployment insurance was enactedin 1935, there were many private unemployment plansestablished by firms and unions. These plans had limitedpotential for growth, however, because they were operatedwithout insurance company expertise and the diversificationcharacteristic of pools formed by private insurers.   This was because state laws generally prohibited insurancecompanies from selling unemployment insurance. In particular,the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the premier insurancecompany of the time, greatly desired to sell unemploymentinsurance but was prevented by New York state law.   Metropolitan Life first lobbied for authorization to sellunemployment insurance in 1919, but the bill stalled in thestate Senate when the superintendent of insurance opposed itas the &quot;entering wedge&quot; of socialism and because an untriedform of insurance would &quot;endanger policyholders' money.&quot; In1924, an authorization bill passed the state Senate, butfailed in the Assembly, partly because labor leader SamuelGompers opposed it on the grounds that it would strengthencompany unions and was a &quot;clever device to reduce wages.&quot;Finally, in 1931 an authorization bill passed both houses ofthe New York legislature. This time, Gov. Franklin Rooseveltvetoed it. Roosevelt feared that the bill would pre-empt aregional conference of governors that he was convening tostudy government unemployment insurance.   Unemployment insurance was prohibited elsewhere:Wisconsin, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia,Connecticut, California, Texas, Illinois, as well as NewYork, all prohibited private unemployment insurance outright.   Because of prohibitions by the states, no viable form ofprivate unemployment insurance existed when the GreatDepression struck. Government insurance then appeared to bethe only solution to the unemployment problem. Privateinsurance no longer even appeared theoretically desirable:The free market was blamed for the depression; rationalgovernment programs to order the chaos of the market wereseen as the solution. Government unemployment insurance wasone of these &quot;rational&quot; programs. And soon governmentunemployment insurance occupied the field and crowded out anyprivate insurance.   No one knows for certain whether private unemploymentinsurance would have worked, but there are good reasons toconclude it might have. Metropolitan Life later concludedthat &quot;probably not even the dire times of 1930-1933 wouldhave shown a deficit for that line of business.&quot;   Private companies are normally more efficient thangovernment and private insurers would have all the tools thatgovernment unemployment insurance employs as well as othersthat have been neglected. Private unemployment insurancecould be made compulsory to avoid &quot;free rider&quot; problems.Under a system of compulsory private insurance, thegovernment would require all workers to purchase unemploymentinsurance but would leave to them the choice of insurer andpolicy. Compulsory insurance would guarantee a market forprivate unemployment insurance, protect economic security byensuring that all workers are covered, but still permit thesuperior efficiency of the private sector.   Government unemployment insurance is plagued by seriousproblems. It significantly increases the amount ofunemployment, is subject to serious abuse by many workers andunfairly redistributes income to workers who are politicallypowerful. While an attempt to reform the government systemmight be made, inefficiency and redistributions to specialinterests are endemic to the political system. Why not giveprivate unemployment insurance a chance to prove itself to besuperior?   ---   Mr. Rappaport is an assistant professor of law at theUniversity of San Diego.</TEXT></DOC>
