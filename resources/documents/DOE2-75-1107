<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-1107 </DOCNO><TEXT>The East Frigg field is remotely operated and controlled from the mainFrigg installations by a redundant multiplex electrohydraulic systemderived from Elf's Skuld experimental project. Since all active productionfunctions are located on the two Production Stations, the Centrl ManifoldStation is nominally operated by ROV or intervention tools deployed fromthe surface. In spite of the distance of 18 km from the control deskto the field, the design of the system provides top reliability and fulloperability over the production life of 14 years. Features are availablefor satisfactory operation in degraded modes. The module configurationmakes it possible to replace the defective module (with a spare one)by diverless intervention within a few days. The hydrostatic pressurebalancing devices make its components independent of the water depth.</TEXT></DOC>
