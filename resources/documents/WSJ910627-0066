In1988, GM spun its Detroit Diesel heavy engine operation intoa joint venture controlled by entrepreneur Roger Penske. Andin 1986, it sold its heavy truck business to a joint venturecontrolled by AB Volvo.   GM doesn't disclose Electro-Motive's annual sales. Theunit has been pressed in recent years by stiff competition,particularly from General Electric Co.'s locomotive unit, theonly other big railway engine maker in the U.S. In 1988, GMmoved to cut costs at Electro-Motive by consolidating most ofthe unit's manufacturing operations in London, Ontario, andclosing a factory in La Grange, Ill., outside Chicago.   Now, GM needs to conserve cash as it tries to reverselosses in its North American auto business and bring out newproducts. A joint venture or outright sale of Electro-Motivewould relieve the demand that operation makes on GM'scapital, freeing up money for the auto operations.   One company that could be interested in Electro-Motive isABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, a Swedish-Swiss company withextensive rail equipment operations in Europe and NorthAmerica. ABB's U.S. unit recently hired Electro-Motive'sformer director of marketing, Lutz Elsner, to run its transitbusiness.   An ABB spokesman declined last night to comment on&quot;rumors&quot; that it was looking at taking a stake in the GMoperation.</TEXT></DOC>
