Presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said the two key Arableaders met for 3{ hours in Assad's Muhajirine palace and talked inparticular about the Palestinian uprising in Israel and the need tosupport it.   ``We all agreed that this is a rare opportunity ... that wouldlead to the restoration of warm relations between Syria and thePLO,'' Palestinian leader Nayef Hawatmeh said before the meeting.   It was the second time that Arafat and Assad have talkedface-to-face since the Syrian president threw the PLO leader out ofSyria in June 1983. They met briefly at the Arab summit in Amman,Jordan, in November.   If their talks are successful, it will mean the end of a riftthat seriously hampered Arab efforts to unite in opposition toIsrael.   Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa and seven of Arafat'ssenior aides _ all members of the ruling central committee ofFatah, the main PLO guerrilla group _ attended the meeting in theheavily guarded palace, the spokesman said.   Like Arafat, most of them had not visited Damascus since Arafatwas expelled at the height of a Syrian-backed mutiny in the PLO.   Arafat's aides arrived in Damascus last week for the funeral ofthe PLO's military commander, Khalil Wazir, assassinated in Tunis,Tunisia, on April 16.   Israeli sources have said Wazir was killed by Israeli commandos,but the government has not confirmed it.   Arafat failed to show up for the funeral Wednesday and flew inSunday from Libya after Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi andAlgerian President Chadli Benjedid intervened.   Monday's crucial session followed a meeting between Assad and aranking Libyan envoy, Lt. Col. Mustafa Kharroubi, who accompaniedArafat from Tripoli to Damascus on Sunday. Officials released nodetails of that meeting.   Hawatmeh, who leads the Marxist Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine, said that Arafat's three-hour session withPalestinian leaders hammered out an agenda for the future.   Hawatmeh said the top priorities were the Palestinian uprisingagainst Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and theUnited States' latest Middle East peace plan, presented to theregion's leaders last month by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   ``These are two very important developments, how to bolster theuprising and foil Shultz's plan,'' Hawatmeh said.   Syria and the PLO have separately rejected Shultz's proposal forlimited Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Bothwant an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.   The peace plan also does not give the PLO a role in the peaceprocess.   Arabs, however, regard the PLO as the sole representative of theworld's 5 million Palestinians.   Asked if it was not too early to talk of an alliance when Arafathas been in Damascus only 24 hours, Hawatmeh declared: ``The factthat he's here means the feud is over.   ``Now we have to move on to the next stage, reviving thestrategic alliance.''   Libya and Algeria, along with Syria, the PLO and Marxist SouthYemen, formed what was called the Arab Steadfastness Front afterthe late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt signed the 1978U.S.-brokered Camp David accord that led to a peace treaty withIsrael a year later.   The anti-peace accord alliance fell apart when the Syria-PLOfeud began.   The feud erupted after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982.   Arafat at that time refused to set up headquarters in Damascusand began looking into the prospects of negotiating peace withIsrael.   That angered Assad and PLO radicals, who advocated armedstruggle against Israel.   In May 1983, the friction exploded into a battle betweenArafat's supporters and Syrian-backed hardliners seeking to oustthe guerrilla chief from the PLO leadership.   Arab leaders have been trying to reconcile Assad and Arafatsince the split but Wazir's assassination accelerated the process.The 52-year-old native of Ramle, now in Israel, was respected byboth Arafat loyalists and pro-Syrian dissidents.   He was said to be the mastermind of the Palestinian uprising inthe occupied territories and his death was a severe blow to thePLO, underscoring Israel's military might.</TEXT></DOC>
