The group is struggling to wrap up more than a month of talksaimed at shaving about $28 billion from the fiscal 1990 deficit.That would reduce red ink to about $100 billion next year asmandated by the Gramm-Rudman law, according to White Houseestimates.   Budget experts agree that any long-term solution to the hugedeficit problem requires a meaningful shift in fiscal policy.Translation: either significant new taxes or reductions in federalprograms or a combination of the two.   But with President Bush opposing new taxes or cuts in militaryspending or foreign aid, and the Democratic-controlled Congresssure to reject deep cuts in domestic programs, the negotiators areable to only nibble at the edges of major policy changes this year.   That scenario has been reinforced directly in recent days asmembers of the negotiating team have presented ideas to theirconstituencies in the White House or on congressional committees.In many cases, they've been told to look elsewhere to reduce thedeficit or face rejection, said sources familiar with theclosed-door meetings.   So in an effort to avert a crisis, such as violatingGramm-Rudman and triggering its automatic spending cuts, the talkshave turned increasingly toward the smoke and mirrors approach tobudgeting.   They are considering:   _Moving payment of some farm subsidies ahead so the checks arewritten this fiscal year instead of next, a shift that makes fiscal1990 look nearly $1 billion trimmer.   _Taking the U.S. Postal Service ``off-budget,'' knocking nearly$2 billion in red ink off the books next year.   _Making an accounting change in the food stamp program to``save'' another $500 million.   _Selling off nearly $6 billion in government assets _ a policywhich often brings in money at first but then costs money in thelong run.   Other items on the list that take advantage of federalaccounting methods include claiming credit for $2 billion trimmedfrom the Medicare program by simply extending existing costcontrols, and about $600 million by continuing a retirement policyfor federal employees.   The group is even prepared to claim $100 million in savingsbecause Congress earlier this year rejected a pay raise for itselfand other top federal officials, according to one source.   Rep. Leon Panetta, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,declined to discuss any specifics, but conceded the negotiatorswere struggling.   ``We've got to reach this goal in a credible way, and it's noteasy,'' he said. ``Under the circumstances we are working with, weare reaching the best possible solution.''   But, he added, ``There's no question that this (package) isgoing to send a message that more needs to be done.''   The budget negotiations have dragged on longer than planned, andCongress will not meet its April 15 deadline for passing a budgetresolution. The budget serves as a blueprint for Congress' annualspending bills and tax legislation.   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, if the president and Congress failto enact legislation that will reduce the deficit to within $10billion of next year's $100 billion target, the administration mustmake across-the-board spending cuts to make up the difference.</TEXT></DOC>
