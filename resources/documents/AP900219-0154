Experts at O.M. Scott andamp; Sons Co., lawn specialists, recommendfeeding your lawn four times a year for best results.   Early Spring: By the end of April, your lawn is on the move.Grass plants send out new shoots from their bases, undergroundrhizomes form offshoot plants, and new roots tap moisture andnutrients. Gardeners then stimulate this activity by applyingnutrients at about this time.   Unfortunately, crabgrass and other annual weeds also are on themove. That's why Scott recommends applying a combination lawnfertilizer and crabgrass preventer. Apply the product by the fourthmowing or before temperatures are regularly in the 80s.   When planting a new lawn or repairing major bare spots, use aspecial fertilizer formulated for starting seeds, sod or sprigs.   Late Spring: By June, grass plants will have consumed nutrientsapplied earlier. Another feeding helps grass stay green, thick andfortified through the hot, tough summer months ahead.   It's likely that a few extras like dandelions, plantain andclover will appear on your lawn. Wait until these weeds areactively growing before clearing them out. Since rapid weed growthusually occurs in time for the second lawn feeding, it makes senseto use a good combination broadleaf weed control plus fertilizer atthis time.   Summer: During June, July and August, your lawn will probablyendure heat and perhaps a few insects. Replenishing the nutrientsupply at this time will stimulate top growth thinned by heat andlack of moisture. Nutrients will also promote production of newleaves and offshoot plants. Insects will thrive near the root zone,so apply a combination insect control plus fertilizer product andwater it in to carry active ingredients down to the root zone.   Late Fall: The year's last feeding should be applied byNovember. This helps winterize the lawn and keep it greener longeras winter approaches. Also, grass plants fed in fall produce andstore carbohydrates for immediate use in early spring, allowing thelawn to green and thicken earlier and faster.   Four feedings are suggested for most grass varieties, includingKentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, fescue and St. Augustine grass. Thereare a few exceptions. Apply three feedings (spring, summer andfall) to centipedegrass, zoysia or Bahia grass. Five feedings arerecommended for Bermuda grass in Florida and mixed dichondragrasslawns.   Because they turn green sooner in spring and stay green longerin the fall than other grasses, cool season grasses are recommendedfor northern areas.   Zoysia and Bermuda grass are used through much of the transitionzone between North and South, even though their growth period isshortened by cool spring and fall weather. In these instances,their increased tolerance of summer heat and drought stress makethem more reasonable to maintain.   In more northern locations, Bermuda grasses not only have ashort growing season but also are more subject to winter kill.Zoysias are hardier in winter but growth usually is restricted tothe frost-free period.   In choosing a grass for your lawn, bluegrases, fine fescues,perennial ryegrasses, turf-type tall fescues and colonialbentgrasses will provide longer periods of green turf in northernlocations.   These same grasses are adapted to fall, winter and springconditions in the transition zone and upper South. But they sufferfrom hot summer conditions and are increasingly difficult to keephealthy further south. Zoysia and Bermuda grass are usedeffectively in these locations.</TEXT></DOC>
