One can sympathize with his sense of insecurity, living as he does across an undefended border from Nicaragua, but it takes no world-class military or political historian to arrive at the age-old recognition that a man without an army is in no position either to make or keep peace. Of all the Central American leaders, he will be the most deserving of the unhappy consequences that at the moment seem hardly avoidable. As for the others, they have played a diplomatic game from which there is no appeal in a genuine, grown-up democracy like the United States: whispering their support for the Contras where it can be heard only by a chosen few and at the same time loudly declaring their approval of an initiative designed to cut the Contras off at the knees. </TEXT></DOC>
