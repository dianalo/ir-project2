The government instead will begin screening each case after Jan.1, with some deportations virtually assured, said ImmigrationMinister Barbara McDougall,   ``I want to state categorically that removals will take place,''she said. ``Many people came here making refugee claims tocircumvent our immigration laws. ... We must restore integrity toour refugee and immigration system.''   She declined at a news conference on Wednesday to estimate howmany of the 85,000 claims pending will be accepted under a two-yearscreening program expected to cost $83 million.   The announcement of the screening program drew criticism fromsome quarters.   ``No one wants to reward refugee scam artists or the blatantqueue-jumpers who take the place of legitimate applicants,'' theToronto Star said in an editorial. ``But to show little compassionfor those thousands who have been here for months seems hard-heartedat the very least.''   The Star, which frequently criticizes Prime Minister BrianMulroney's Progressive Conservative government, asked if this couldbe the same Canada that ``demonstrated its compassion to the world''in 1979 by accepting more than 75,000 Vietnamese boat people.   But the tabloid Toronto Sun praised the decision. ``Deporting thephony refugees is the only fair way to handle those who try to jumpthe queue ahead of those who have been waiting for years, some ofthem to be reunited with their families.''   Officials said humanitarian or compassionate grounds will beconsidered before any deportation.   Although activists believe the program could threaten peoplegenuinely seeking refuge in Canada, others say many of theimmigrants are seeking economic improvements and not politicalsafety.   The program will send each of the 85,000 people claiming refugeestatus before government panels, each with two members. A decisionby any one member of the panel that political, religious or otherreasons threaten the claimant's safety is enough to clear the way toimmigrant status.   The special program was needed only for the backlog because a newsystem is intended to reject false refugee claims upon arrival inCanada. A limited amnesty was declared in May 1986 for about 22,000people who were then claiming refugee status, granting residency toall who already had jobs or family in Canada and no criminal record.   The backlog of refugee claims has increased steadily from 6,500in 1984 to the current level, which would take five to seven yearsto clear under the present system.   Alan Shefman of the Ontario Human Rights Commission said in aphone interview there was cautious optimism that the refugeeclaimants will get ``fair and quick hearings.'' He said theorganization was relieved that the claimants will be able to workwhile awaiting a decision.   Canada, the world's second-largest country in territory, has apopulation of 26 million. It traditionally has encouragedimmigration, and the government has raised its target from 125,000to 135,000 in 1988 to 150,000 to 160,000 next year.</TEXT></DOC>
