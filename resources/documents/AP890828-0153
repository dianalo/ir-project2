His appointment follows the July 16 death of Herbert von Karajan,the longtime guiding spirit and conductor of the festival who diedof a heart attack at age 81.   The board of the festival announced that Mortier, 46, will takeover at Salzburg on Oct. 1, 1991. But starting next month he willhelp plan festival events to be held after 1991, the Austria PressAgency reported.   In another appointment, the board named Hans Landesmann, a musicmanager in Vienna, as the festival's economic director.   ``The festival has become an old museum, unaware of what's goingon in the world. We should give modern music and drama the placethey deserve,'' Landesmann said in an interview.   For years, critics said tickets to the Salzburg Festival cost toomuch, and that proceedings were too much under the sway of Karajan.   Austrian cultural politicians now are trying to open the69-year-old festival to new forms of art and invite a greatervariety of musicians.   Under a plan outlined in June, the unpaid, honorary five-manboard of the festival will be replaced by a permanent, salariedthree-member board.   ``We need new, forward-thinking people in the management, muchmore aware of the contemporary scene,'' said Landesmann, who is todraw up a reform program.   Landesmann said he would like to include artists on a new boardto advise on projects.   He said he would also like to see film and video galas andexhibits during the festival.   While not playing down the merits of Italian traditional operashere every year, Landesmann proposes to include other composers,such as Richard Strauss and Alban Berg.   There is also talk among festival organizers of devoting the2,600-seat Great Festival Hall to foreign classical opera and theLittle Festival Hall to Mozart productions.   ``We want a repertoire consistent with the line of Mozart'sheritage, something specific, typical of Salzburg,'' Landesmann said.   In an attempt to prevent the rise of another domineering figuresuch as Karajan, he said, no permanent conductor will be named.Invitations will go out to well-known figures such as Sir GeorgSolti, Riccardo Muti and Claudio Abbado, all of whom are presentthis summer.   ``Karajan was opposed to reforms. He was an old man and he didn'tlike changes. He was opposed to seeing new people,'' Landesmann said.   Five years ago, government auditors had urged festival organizersto spend less.   Press chief Hans Widrich said the festival runs an annual budgetof $27 million. State subsidies total $7.7 million and the restcomes from ticket sales, radio and television rights.   Salzburg pays some of the highest performer fees in Europe andcharges nearly twice the top ticket prices of other Europeanfestivals _ up to $250 for the best seat at the opera.</TEXT></DOC>
