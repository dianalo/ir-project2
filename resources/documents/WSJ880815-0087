The crime? More heinous than insider trading? More dastardly than securities fraud? Hardly. The two employees, mere temporary clerks, scarfed free cups of coffee meant for the firm's well-heeled traders, Merrill employees say.    And it won't, it seems, happen again.    &quot;Effective immediately,&quot; the employees of Merrill's government securities trading subsidiary were told, anyone &quot;caught, seen or suspected of taking free lunch, coffee, cookies, etc. from any area of Merrill Lynch will be terminated immediately.&quot; Period.    To the legion of clerks and computer operators who toil for as little as $20,000 a year processing the trades put together by the firm's millionaire dealmakers, Merrill's action had all the makings of a Dickensian drama.    Merrill provides its traders with free coffee, tea -- even herbal teas -- and a free lunch every day. But alas, there is no free lunch -- or coffee for that matter -- for the clerks in what is commonly called the back office. Their coffee costs 35 cents a cup, and there are no free refills. Says one disgruntled clerk, &quot;Everybody dumps on the back office.&quot;    According to the clerk, Merrill's traders are all too anxious to talk to the back office types when something goes wrong and they need help assembling the paperwork on a trade. But just let one of those clerks stroll down to the trading floor for a free cup of java -- which they like to do routinely -- and the traders will say, &quot;Hey, what are you doing here?&quot; this clerk says.    The man behind this coffee crackdown, government securities administrator Ray Gottardi, declines to comment on the memo he authored.    Merrill Lynch's official comment: &quot;Merrill Lynch has a stringent set of policies on all unethical behavior. In this matter, Mr. Gottardi had given several warnings on stealing of food by members of his staff in other areas of the company. As a result, he found this situation intolerable and he took action.&quot;    But didn't the intolerable ones only steal a cup of coffee? &quot;It really doesn't matter,&quot; one company spokesman says. &quot;Even if they stole one grape, they were told not to do it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
