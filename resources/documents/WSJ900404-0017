But feuds are alreadybubbling over at the legislation's next stop: the House.   The vote in the Senate was 89 to 11.</LP><TEXT>   Unless the bill's leaders move to prevent it, strongpro-environment sentiment on the House floor could mean abill that is even tougher on industry than the one passed bythe Senate. Scores of business and environmental lobbyistsare now descending on the House to try to shape the next stepof the process.   At stake is historic legislation to make the nationbreathe easier, but with the power to push up electricityrates, raise car prices, shut down factories and idleworkers. The Bush administration figures the Senate billcould cost U.S. business as much as $21.5 billion annually bythe year 2005, when the measures are to be fully implemented.Though there is debate about exactly how large the cost willbe, consumers ultimately will bear much of it.   Environmentalists are determined to press House members topass an even more stringent bill than the Senate. &quot;Ouroverall view is that the Senate clean-air bill requires majorsurgery,&quot; says Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.&quot;Hopefully, we'll find many good doctors in the House.&quot;   Industry will try to undo some of what it sees as costlydamage done by the Senate. Says William Fay, head of anindustrywide lobbying group: &quot;You don't get a lot of extraenvironmental benefit from the Senate bill, but you addincredibly to the cost and burden on American business.&quot;   President Bush signaled yesterday that he intends to keeppushing for a middle ground. &quot;I again reject the extremistsin the environmental movement who would burden our economy bymindless regulation,&quot; Mr. Bush said in Indiana, where he wason a political fund-raising trip. &quot;And I reject those who donot recognize their obligation to clean up the environment.Common sense tells us to find a needed balance. We will findthat balance.&quot;   Industry isn't likely to find much solace in the House ifits pleas have to be dealt with in recorded votes. Risingpublic concern for the environment will be a bigger factorthere than it had been in the Senate. The 20th anniversary ofEarth Day on April 22 is sure to turn up the political heat.Some White House officials close to clean-air negotiationsfear that lawmakers will cast votes in order to appearsensitive to the environment, regardless of costs.   Industry is pinning its hopes on Rep. John Dingell, thechairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. An unabashedprotector of auto companies, he is sympathetic to manyindustry complaints. Mr. Dingell could keep some of thehottest issues from roll-call votes on the floor by lockingthem up in compromises in his committee, which is voting onits own clean-air bill this week.   Already the Michigan Democrat has agreed to accept harshercutbacks in exhaust emissions from new cars in order tosecure a binding agreement with the panel's chiefenvironmentalist, Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman from smoggyLos Angeles. Committee approval of that agreement effectivelykeeps that issue out of debate on the House floor.   And just yesterday, Mr. Dingell also won unanimousagreement from his committee for a compromise on regulatingcancer-causing factory emissions, a move also aimed atpreventing a contentious floor showdown on the issue.   The White House is pivotal in this tug of war betweenbusiness and environmental interests. Business groups arepressing the administration to stick to a more lenientpackage it proposed last year. But the White House and itschief clean-air sponsors, including Mr. Dingell, have alreadysent strong signals that they don't believe theadministration-backed bill would pass without stricterconstraints.   Steelmakers appear to be more concerned about thelegislation than any other industrial group. A provision inthe Senate bill threatens mandatory shutdowns within 10 yearsif chemical plants, refineries and coke ovens are unable tomeet strict new emission standards designed to lessen therisk of cancer to residents of areas near the facilities.About 200 steelworkers from LTV Corp. and USX Corp. protestedat the Capitol yesterday, contending that their jobs are onthe line.   The Senate bill would exempt the steel industry fromshutdowns for the next 30 years provided the industry meetsmore stringent emission standards. But steel officials saythe provision would require them to move faster and spendmore to cut emissions than any other industry. They estimatethe cost to be more than $5 billion by 1995, which they saywould funnel money away from modernization efforts and hurttheir competitiveness.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, however, argues that steelmakersdon't deserve any special break. The Ohio Democrat says thatemissions from steelmakers' coke ovens are among the mostdangerous. Besides, he says, &quot;I do not believe there will beplant closings and job layoffs&quot; as a result of the stricterstandards.   Big oil companies also feel gouged. They foresee expensiverefinery and distribution changes by 1992 if they are forcedto add ethanol or methanol to reformulated gasoline, as theSenate bill demands. The American Petroleum Institute, themain oil trade group, says the new gasoline would cost 20cents to 25 cents more a gallon. The fuel would be sold inthe nation's nine smoggiest cities.   Auto makers say they lack the technology to cut emissionsas aggressively and as fast as the Senate legislationrequires. Key House members already have staked out a similarthough slightly less tough position on tailpipe exhausts. Theindustry will have wait until later to press for changes whena House-Senate conference hammers out differences between thelegislation passed by the chambers.   High-sulfur-coal companies and miners failed to win reliefin the Senate from acid-rain provisions. The Senate billcalls for industry to spend $4 billion a year to neutralizeacid rain. Unless Midwesterners in the House can pull off anacid-rain aid package, which is highly unlikely, producerssuch as Consolidation Coal Co. and Island Creek Corp. saythey will lose customers as utilities switch to low-sulfurcoal. Some 11,000 to 16,000 miners of high-sulfur coal,principally in West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio andPennsylvania, may lose their jobs.   But environmentalists have their problems with the Senatebill, too. They believe that Senate leaders started out withan environmentally aggressive proposal, but made too manyconcessions in an effort to avoid a White House veto orRepublican filibuster on the floor.   Without tougher smog provisions than are in the Senatebill, environmentalists predict that many cities will misstheir deadlines for reducing unhealthful smog levels. Theyalso say that auto companies aren't pushed hard enough todevelop new technologies to reduce tailpipe emissions in carsto be built after the year 2003.   Despite the threat of automatic shutdown for plants thatcan't meet stricter emission standards, environmentalists areupset that cancer risks won't be eliminated for people livingnear polluting plants. They also claim the Senate billrestricts the authority of the federal government to step inwhen smoggy areas fail to create their ownpollution-reduction plans.   &quot;If the standard is `Is this bill better than currentlaw?' it obviously is,&quot; says Gene Karpinski, executivedirector of U.S. Public Interest Research Group. &quot;If thestandard is `Is this as good as we should have done?' itobviously is not.&quot;   But while industries and regions of the country are lockedin their own individual battles for relief, a great deal ofthe air-pollution issue is all but decided.   The legislation sets standards for the next decade or sowith respect to all the major issues, including car exhausts,acid rain, toxic industrial emissions and alternative fuels.But it also goes further in an effort to set clean-airstandards for the first decade of the next century. Much ofthe House debate is expected to focus on these long-rangegoals.   &quot;If we had had a bill that addressed the clean-airproblems in the U.S. for the next 10 or 12 years alone, we'dhave had very few arguments,&quot; says William Reilly, chief ofthe Environmental Protection Agency. &quot;It's only when you moveinto that second phase that you see very large cost numbersand very large differences of opinion.&quot;   Billions of dollars of pollution regulation, much of it inMr. Bush's original clean-air proposal, is now accepted andhas not drawn serious challenge in Congress.   Surprisingly, one of the least controversial provisions ofthe bill puts the nation's first acid-rain control law on thebooks, requiring coal-burning power plants to cut theiremissions.   For years, ferocious battling by coal and utilityinterests made acid rain the key stumbling block to passageof sweeping clean-air legislation. President Reagan doubtedacid rain was a serious problem. But Mr. Bush's campaignpledge to address acid rain, combined with agreement betweenthe White House and environmentalists on a 10 million-tonsulfur-dioxide reduction, have forced even the oldest foes toadmit the inevitably of acid-rain controls.   Even though many utility companies are skeptical thescheme will ever work, lawmakers generally agree that thereis a need for an innovative pollution trading system to holddown the pricetag for acidrain controls. Under the proposedsystem, utilities that voluntarily made extra-deep cuts wouldget pollution credits; they could sell or swap these creditsto other utilities, which could then use them to expand. Anationwide cap on total power-plant emissions theoreticallywould preserve cleanair gains for decades.   There is widespread agreement among lawmakers to junk aregulatory system that has set standards on air emissions ofonly seven toxic chemicals in 20 years. Most legislators nowagree instead on requiring factories, from chemical plants todry cleaners, to install the best anti-pollution technologyavailable. The goal would be to prevent at least 2,200 annualcancer deaths from toxic industrial emissions, while alsoreducing birth defects and respiratory disease. The deepdifferences lie in how to cut the remaining emissions.   Lawmakers have reached general agreement on settingdeadlines to reduce smog. Rather than imposing a singlenationwide deadline for cleaning up smog, the new approach isto tailor deadlines to fit cities' pollution problems. LosAngeles, the smoggiest city, for example, would have untilthe year 2010 to eliminate unhealthy levels of ozone, themain ingredient in smog. There is also general agreement thatauto emissions must get cleaner. Exactly how clean remains atissue.   One of the biggest changes from previous attempts to cleanup smog in cities is to require not only that vehicles becleaner-burning but that their fuel get cleaner as well.President Bush proposed the idea, and now both houses ofCongress seem to be buying it. The fuel of choice remains tobe decided. However, policy makers are tilting toward areformulated gasoline.   Here are the major unsettled issues likely to confront theHouse, where Mr. Dingell's committee hopes to complete itswork on clean-air legislation this week. The full House hopesto take up the legislation in May.                                                                                                          -- ACID RAIN: Whether to help Midwest utilities shoulderthe steep cost of acid rain controls -- an issue that hasstymied clean-air legislation for years -- will probably bedecided through a bruising regional battle, possibly thisweek in committee.   Rep. Phil Sharp, an Indiana Democrat whose state would behit with higher electricity bills because of acid-raincontrols, leads the advocates for a subsidy for theMidwestern utility companies that would have to do the bulkof the acid-rain cleanup. He is pitted against lawmakers fromstates, such as some in the West, whose utilities havealready cleaned up their emissions and don't want to bail outthe Midwest.   There may also be an attempt to provide extra unemploymentbenefits for high-sulfur coal miners who will lose theirjobs. An effort to legislate such relief in the Senate failedby a single vote.                                                                                                          -- ALTERNATIVE FUELS: On split votes, Mr. Dingell'scommittee has adopted an alternative-fuels program thatrelies heavily on reformulated gasoline in the nine smoggiestcities. But the issue is destined to arise again on the Housefloor.   Rep. Waxman and Rep. Bill Richardson, a New MexicoDemocrat, plan to push for a tougher program requiring wideuse of reformulated gas for cars and evencleaneralternatives, like natural gas, for fleet vehicles. Big Oil'spatrons, led by Texas Reps. Ralph Hall, a Democrat, and JackFields, a Republican, will try to hold the line.                                                                                                          -- CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS: Environmentalists hope to persuadethe House to match a Senate provision that would require theU.S., ahead of other countries, to phase outchlorofluorocarbons entirely. CFCs, used chiefly asrefrigerants, tend to deplete the Earth's ozone layer, theatmospheric layer that screens out much ultravioletradiation. However, the administration opposes a unilateralban on CFCs in favor of international agreements to phase outthe chemicals.   For the Senate, the path to approving a clean-air bill wasanything but smooth. Early on, fears of a presidential vetoor Republican filibuster -- prompted by industry outcriesover the cost of a committee-approved bill -- sent Senateleaders and the White House into four weeks of closed-doornegotiations. There, they cut the crucial deals, includingthe exemption for coke ovens and the extra pollutionallowances for utility companies, that are behind the Senatebill.   Despite opposition from industry and environmental groups,the compromise held. During a month of votes on the floor,lawmakers turned back an effort to wring additionalreductions in air pollution from cars and fuel and refused tomaintain a strong federal role in forcing states and citiesto clean up smog. They also killed a provision that wouldhave allowed factories whose fumes pose cancer risks to buyout adjoining neighborhoods if they couldn't reduce thehealth risk.   The result is a Senate bill that doesn't totally pleaseeither environmentalists or industry. Business is so upset,in fact, that at a contentious closed-door meeting recently,industry leaders lashed out at White House officials forcompromising with Senate leaders on air-pollution controlsthat many corporate leaders feel are too expensive.</TEXT></DOC>
