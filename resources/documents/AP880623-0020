The Democratic platform drafting committee, headed by Rep.William H. Gray III of Philadelphia, has already distributed adraft document to the campaigns of Michael Dukakis and JesseJackson.   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman serving as MichaelDukakis's chief link to the platform committee, said Wednesday,``There will be a draft put before the members Friday morning.''   Barnes said the draft incorporates the dozen separate issue``working papers'' produced at an earlier meeting of the platformwriters on Mackinac Island, Mich.   ``It pulls them all together,'' he said.   But Barnes said there has been no closing of the gap between theDukakis and Jackson camps on whether the platform should embraceJackson's call for higher taxes on the wealthy and a freeze onPentagon spending.   Rosemary Freeman, executive director of the Democratic PlatformCommittee, said the preliminary draft was still being finalized.She called it ``a collective effort'' by the same people whohammered out the earlier issue papers.   The party released two final working papers on national securityand political empowerment. The former reflects the Dukakiscampaign's insistence that the platform call for ``stable'' defensebudgets; the latter, in a nod to Jackson, commits the party toremoving ``impediments to the one-person, one-vote principle.''   Whatever emerges Friday from Gray's 16-member drafting committeewill be subject to further discussion and revision when the full186-member Platform Committee meets over the weekend in Denver forthe first time.   Jackson has enough delegates to force a floor fight at nextmonth's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta over any platformissue he chooses.   Some Dukakis backers have hinted they would welcome a chance toshoot down a plank promising a tax hike. Walter Mondale, the 1984nominee, got nothing but grief from his promise to raise taxes.   Gray, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has had hisstaff put the draft in mark-up format, with numbered lines, to makeit easier for the drafting committee to make additions anddeletions.   Although a Jackson supporter, Gray has been handling hisdrafting role in an impartial fashion. The 16 members include sixeach from the Dukakis and Jackson camps and four appointed by PaulG. Kirk Jr., the party chairman, who has asked the platform writersto produce a short, visionary statement, free of special interestboilerplates.   The new working paper on national security says the nation'sstrength has been ``sapped by a defense establishment that haswasted money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead ofinvesting more in readiness and mobility.''   ``We further believe that our strength is enhanced by stabledefense budgets and by a commitment by our allies to assure theirfair share of the costs and responsibilities required to maintainpeace and liberty,'' the paper says.   It says the Democrats ``will promote peace and prevent war _ notby trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans toundefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... not by toasting atyrant like Marcos as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining astable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat,in standing up to any American adversary whenever necessary andsitting down with him whenever possible.''   The document calls for ``maintaining the special relationshipwith Israel,'' while promoting a Middle East agreement that hews tothe Camp David Accords. It says a Democratic administration would``end all vestiges of the failed policy of constructive engagementand will declare South Africa a terrorist state (and) imposecomprehensive sanctions.''   The paper would commit the party to same-day voter registrationand registration by mail and calls for a removal of ``impedidentsto the one-person, one-vote principle,'' it said.   Jackson, who won 29 percent of the primary votes but just 24percent of the delegates, has complained about the way some statesallocated delegates.</TEXT></DOC>
