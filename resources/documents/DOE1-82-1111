<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-1111 </DOCNO><TEXT>A program concentrating on 100% methanol fueled spark ignition engineswas initiated with the objective to evaluate cold start performance,engine wear and driveability of vehicles operated under Canadian climaticconditions. The first vehicle involved in this program is a VW Golf,equipped with a 1.6 liter engine which is factory modified for operationon methanol. It was assigned for chassis dynamometer evaluation. A totalof about 10,600 kilometres has been accumulated. In order to documentthe engine condition and establish baseline data for an enigne wear analysis,it was decided that as part of the vehicle preparation, the conditionof the engine should be established. This technical report describesthe details of the engine disassembly, measurements and results and itsassembly and installation in the VW Golf vehicle. An additional taskwas the development of a detailed work program with the objective ofproviding systematic information on cold start performance of methanolpowered vehicles and identifying the best possible solution(s). A statementof work for this future phase is presented in an appendix. 23 figs.,18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
