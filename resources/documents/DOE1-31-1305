Five years later four lessons are clear: 1)solar access protection for the south walls of houses sited on north-southstreets is difficult to achieve, 2) requiring east-west building orientationin new developments without solar access is meaningless and better resultsmay be achieved through a performance-based approach, 3) solar accesspermits have not been used in the numbers anticipated as a way to increasesolar access over and above the protection of the solar fence, and 4)residential and commercial building should not be treated the same forpurposes of solar access and siting.</TEXT></DOC>
