In the report for 1986, when Owens-Corning's profit plunged 88%, the table was dropped. The plunge made its first appearance on page 22.    In its annual report for the fiscal year ended last April 30, Bear Stearns Cos. ran a list of 95 &quot;selected&quot; corporate underwritings managed or co-managed by its securities unit during the year. The list didn't include two of Bear Stearns's biggest underwritings -- an $81 million convertible debt issue for financially troubled Crazy Eddie Inc. in July 1986 and a $75 million bond issue for scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. the following month.    Companies have long sought to look their best in annual reports. But consultants and financial analysts say that in recent years, as economic pressures and foreign and domestic competition have mounted, the reports are going much further than ever in hiding bad news, leaving out embarrassing events and blowing the corporation's own horn.    &quot;More than ever, companies are trying to tell it like it ain't,&quot; says Sid Cato, the publisher of a Waukesha, Wis., newsletter on annual reports. Of course, shareholders who want to see it told like it is can always look at a company's annual 10K report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but few take advantage of that opportunity.    The content of annual reports is expected to become more controversial from now on, Mr. Cato and other experts say. For the past five years, corporate America has been asking the SEC to permit an abbreviated report. Companies say they want to pare skyrocketing production costs of slick-papered, four-color reports filled with expensive photos, charts and graphs. They would like to keep them glitzy but cut down on some of the guts. Recently their campaign bore fruit: The SEC gave permission to General Motors Corp. to issue a &quot;summary&quot; annual report.    As a result of the SEC action, say accountants and SEC staff members, it is likely that a slew of companies will begin issuing summary reports in 1987. &quot;Companies don't have to ask special permission to do it,&quot; says an SEC spokesman, &quot;now that our correspondence with GM has been made public.&quot;    Companies issuing summary annual reports generally will be able to cut the size of the annual report in half, accountants say. While the summary report must include a full profit-and-loss statement and balance sheet and a management analysis of major business risks and liabilities, companies can pare financial statements by eliminating or reducing detailed footnotes on long-term debt, leases and debt-covenant descriptions. And companies issuing summary reports may well decide to reduce, say, descriptions of subsidiaries, operations and products.    &quot;Permitting a summary annual report will only permit more abuses and reduce already minimal disclosure,&quot; says Thornton O'glove, a financial analyst and publisher of Quality of Earnings, a monthly report for institutional investors. &quot;Even under current requirements, if a company can hide something, it will. With so many corporate restructurings taking place, the rocks with which they can cover the bad news are getting bigger and bigger.&quot;    Did Owens-Corning and Bear Stearns try to bury bad news? Bradford C. Oelman, Owens-Corning's vice president for corporate relations, explains that he was transferred to company headquarters in Toledo last November to, among other things, supervise preparation of the report. He had been the company's lobbyist in Washington for a decade.    &quot;This was the first annual report I'd done, and I didn't look at the previous reports,&quot; Mr. Oelman says. &quot;I wanted to get the job done as cleanly and quickly as possible. The financial summary seemed unnecessary.&quot;    The Bear Stearns report points out that the underwritings list &quot;is only a selection,&quot; says a spokeswoman, who adds: &quot;Wedtech is a sensitive issue.&quot;    Asserts Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.: &quot;If Bear Stearns listed its winners in its annual report, it should also -- in the interest of full disclosure -- have included its lemons.&quot;    Annual reports are often more interesting for what they leave out, says William P. Dunk, a New York consultant who advises companies on how to make reports more forthright. Mr. Dunk is particularly critical of the 1986 reports of the seven Baby Bell companies, which were spun off from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in 1984.    &quot;With fancy graphics, they carefully gloss over their service problems, which the public knows have been immense, and mainly focus on the new romance of technology,&quot; Mr. Dunk says. He describes this as &quot;not very helpful to investors worried about whether the phone companies are being responsive to the public.&quot;    Replies Kathleen Hughes, the director of media relations for Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp.: &quot;The level of customer complaints about service since divestiture has sharply dropped, so our 1986 annual report focuses on developing a more coherent future for the consumer.&quot; The report, she notes, features philosophic statements by &quot;five imaginative thinkers&quot; such as futurist Alvin Toffler and author James Dickey on &quot;what the future holds.&quot;    The maiden annual report last autumn of Home Shopping Network Inc., a retailer via television that went public last year, omitted an important piece of bad news, asserts Roger S. West III, the chairman of Broker Securities Inc., a discount brokerage firm based in Norfolk, Va. Mr. West is critical of the Clearwater, Fla., company for failing to disclose how many customers were returning products after buying them. The returns rate was running at 17% of gross sales, high for the industry.    Home Shopping was a stock-market highflier last year. Adjusted for two subsequent splits, its stock was offered at $3 in May 1986 and more than doubled on the first day of trading. Last January the stock hit a high of $47.    After issuance of the annual report, returns of merchandise climbed even further, to 24.4% last February. Because of unusually high returns of two of Home Shopping's most important products -- women's furs and brand-name computers -- February sales declined 6.5% from January. When this was disclosed by the company in March, the stock plunged more than 19% in one day to close at $23.875. It has since dropped to $14.625.    Most retailers disclose their rate of customer returns. Home Shopping's rate of returns -- more than triple the industry average -- &quot;should have been footnoted in the annual report as a material fact,&quot; Mr. West contends.    George L. Patterson, who was Home Shopping's chief financial officer from July 1986 until last May, stresses that the report, for the year ended Aug. 31, 1986, was the company's &quot;first pass at annual reports.&quot; He says, &quot;I've learned a lot since then.&quot; Based on the company's more recent experience with returns, he says, their inclusion in the report might have been wiser.    More company executives are using annual reports &quot;to promote themselves or pat themselves on the back for no reason,&quot; asserts Mr. Cato, the newsletter publisher. He cites the annual reports of Nafco Financial Group Inc. for the year ended last Sept. 30 and Malrite Communications Group Inc. for calendar 1986.    The first 10 pages of the Nafco report, observes Mr. Cato, mention Chief Executive Donald B. zumFelde nine times, including five times on page 10, and contain Mr. zumFelde's picture three times, once alone and twice in groups.    &quot;That's a record in ego self-fulfillment for the hundreds of annual reports I look at,&quot; says Mr. Cato. &quot;I'd be amazed if potential investors and analysts aren't turned off by such self-promotion.&quot;    Darlene Cecil, the advertising manager for Nafco, a Naples, Fla., holding company for thrifts and other financial services, says that six of the nine references to Mr. zumFelde were &quot;for picture captions or to identify him as an officer in subsidiaries.&quot; She says that Nafco's 1986 annual report won a first-place award in southwestern Florida for creativity, composition and graphics from the American Advertising Federation.    Mr. Cato complains that although Malrite, a TV and radio station owner and operator, lost almost $9 million in 1986 after four years of annual profits, it still filled its latest annual report with &quot;banal&quot; puffery. In large type on page one of the report, Mr. Cato points out, the Cleveland-based company states that &quot;after watching our industry's upheavals for the last two years, it is perhaps worth reminding ourselves who we are: We are broadcasters.&quot;    The letter to shareholders by Chairman Milton Maltz is peppered with &quot;inanities,&quot; Mr. Cato says. For example, Mr. Cato notes, the letter tells shareholders that Malrite executives are &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;realistic.&quot;    &quot;But apparently not profitable,&quot; he adds. In the first half of 1987, Malrite reported a loss of $4.7 million, compared with a loss of $2.9 million a year earlier.    &quot;Good things don't happen overnight,&quot; retorts Kevan Fight, Malrite's vice president for finance. &quot;Mr. Cato doesn't understand our company or he would know that 85% of our loss last year resulted from a programming write-down that we explain in the annual report. Also, a company like ours can show a loss and still have a bright future because of potential cash flow from turning around unprofitable stations.&quot;    Because many managements prefer to slough over problems rather than face them, most annual reports excel more in communications than in disclosure, says Mr. Dunk, the consultant, who adds: &quot;This makes many annual reports read like Truman Capote novels -- truth in fiction.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
