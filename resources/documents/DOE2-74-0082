The objective of this research investigation is to develop accurate,robust, and cost-effective numerical methods for the simulation of highlyadvective flow problems with particular attention to groundwater contaminationand design of mitigation techniques. The emphasis of our work is on formulationand implementation of parallel algorithms on emerging computer architectures.We feel that parallelization offers great promise in developing morerealistic and economic computer codes for modeling flow in porous mediaproblems. This basic goal is of particular relevance today because ofthe increasing requirements by government and industrial groups to evaluatecontamination situations. For the most part present day simulations arerestricted to two spatial variables and to one or two components. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
