A. Lawrence Walsh   B. Alexia Morrison   C. Whitney North Seymour   D. Terry Eastland   The special prosecutors all kept their jobs despite, respectively, getting plea bargains and indictments for nonexistent crimes, blackmailing her target into signing away his statute-of-limitations rights and trying to subpoena a foreign ambassador. Mr. Eastland, one of the brightest young conservatives, is out of work for not defending Mr. Meese hard enough.    It's fascinating to see liberal politicians and reporters now lauding Mr. Eastland, who if anything has been more loyal to conservative principles than has even his former boss. The roller coaster of Mr. Eastland's career at Justice tracks perfectly the ups and downs of the department. He thought he was coming to Washington to promote serious issues of substance, but soon learned that Washington doesn't work that way.    Ironically, the last time Mr. Eastland was in the news was for the &quot;expose&quot; of an internal memorandum he wrote late last year. News of the memo, titled &quot;A Strategy for the Remaining Months,&quot; was interpreted by headline writers as a cause for embarrassment, not for serious discussion of any of the issues.    &quot;We must polarize the debate&quot; to clarify the policy choices, the memo said. &quot;We must not seek 'consensus,' we must confront. Of course, we must confront sensibly, in ways designed to win the debate and further our agenda.&quot; Mr. Eastland proposed a federal pledge campaign for local law-enforcement agencies to increase spending on enforcing the drug laws. He said AIDS should be treated first as a health issue, not a civil-rights issue. In a section on &quot;Truth in the Courtroom,&quot; he threw down this gauntlet: &quot;If you're against exclusionary rule reform, or Miranda reform, you're against truth in the courtroom and you're against public safety.&quot; Is George Bush looking for a speech writer?    Mr. Eastland first attracted attention with the book he co-wrote with Bill Bennett in 1979 attacking busing and racial quotas. Justice pushed hard on these issues until Brad Reynolds paid the ultimate political price. Mr. Eastland helped select many intellectually powerful federal judges. Yet he saw the best hope for a principled new jurisprudence die with the savaging of Bob Bork.    Mr. Eastland promoted the &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; program for drug users. People crossing the borders are now busted for even small amounts of drugs. This can also mean impounding ships and planes, including most recently the good ship &quot;Monkey Business.&quot; Many liberals oppose prosecuting users, and now invoke the property rights of stoned yachtsmen.    Despite many gains, the sad truth is that most of Mr. Eastland's time was spent sticking his finger in the dike of politically motivated attacks on Mr. Meese. The smears continue apace despite independent counsel James McKay's warning that he won't indict on any of the allegations from Wedtech to the Iraqi pipeline to Ursula Meese's job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society.    Still, there's no gainsaying that Mr. Meese contributed to his problems. A top culprit is his public friendship with e. robert wallach (as he likes to be styled), the liberal San Francisco lawyer who is the link to Wedtech and the Iraqi pipeline. Instead of spending his time on principled arguments against minority set-aside contracts, Mr. Eastland had to defend the Meese-Wallach association with Wedtech, the defense contractor that was built on these contracts. Mr. Wallach once even invoked his friendship with Mr. Meese to lobby Mr. Eastland to stop Justice's campaign for original-intent jurisprudence -- which Mr. Eastland largely created. Now Mr. Eastland is fired for insufficiently enthusiastic personal loyalty to the attorney general he tried to protect.    As we said even before the Meese-Eastland affair, loyalty up requires loyalty down, and we might add, loyalty to some larger vision of the public good. We're back to a familiar basic issue: The policy views of Messrs. Meese and Eastland, and of Elliott Abrams, Leslie Lenkowsky, Ray Donovan, Faith Whittlesey, Theodore Olson and other conservatives simply aren't acceptable in Washington society. Washington has come to resemble a self-contained biological system, sending out antibodies and macrophages to devour any stray, intruding intellectual virus.    It is hard to say which is the more sickening sight: Poor Ed Meese, pestered into a bizarre autoimmune response, consuming his own and himself. Or the spectacle of Mr. Eastland being &quot;defended&quot; and lionized by the same Washington that during his five years at Justice wouldn't give his serious views the time of day. </TEXT></DOC>
