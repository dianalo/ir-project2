The pact calls for Nippon Steel to get a 49% interest inOracle's Japanese subsidiary, Oracle Japan, which markets anddistributes the database software company's products inJapan. Nippon Steel will also get $100 million of 10-yearconvertible subordinated debentures with a 9% interest rateand $100 million of convertible preferred stock that pays a6% annual dividend.</LP><TEXT>   The securities may be converted over the next 10 yearsinto Oracle common stock under a complex formula, or simplypaid off in cash. Nippon Steel has agreed not to acquireadditional shares of Oracle for at least a decade, withcertain minor exceptions.   The unusual agreement with Nippon Steel, which hasdiversified into various computer-related businesses inrecent years, comes at a time of financial difficulty forOracle. Once a high-flyer, Oracle has lately posteddisappointing results and reported its first-ever quarterlyloss in September. In March, it announced that accountingproblems would result in a $7 million pretax charge andrestated results for its third quarter ended Feb. 28.   Analysts said its troubles stem from weak managementcontrols and aggressive sales tactics, and the firm's lendershave apparently become leery of its prospects. In January,the company said its bank lines of credit were cut byone-third to $170 million. Oracle said it will use theproceeds from the Nippon Steel transaction to pay off some ofits credit lines and for other general corporate purposes.   &quot;We clearly feel going it alone in Japan is very difficultand we had been looking for ways to improve our capitalstructure,&quot; said Jeffrey Henley, Oracle chief financialofficer. &quot;This afforded the opportunity to meet bothobjectives in one fell swoop.&quot;   In national over-the-counter trading, Oracle shares closedat $8.375, up 87.5 cents apiece, on heavy volume of 1.3million shares.   Under the agreement, the subordinated debentures areconvertible to Oracle common stock at $27.50 a share as theymature beginning in 1999. The preferred stock will beconvertible after four years into common based on the commonstock price at the time, as long as Nippon Steel's totalannual return on the preferred stock portion does not exceed14%, including the 6% annual dividend.   Oracle, for its part, has the right to redeem thepreferred stock after four years, and, if not converted tocommon, Nippon Steel has the right to receive cash repaymentover five years beginning in 1997.</TEXT></DOC>
