PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Working to improve the water supply in aremote Guatemalan village isn't everybody's dream honeymoon. But itsuited Bud Philbrook and Michele Gran, and a decade later therewards from their efforts are still spreading.   The newlywed couple in 1979 spent half their two-week honeymoonin San Miguel de Conacaste, a farming village of 1,300 people,helping to prepare a brochure describing the village's developmentefforts and a loan proposal for an irrigation system.   From that small beginning grew Global Volunteers, a non-profitorganization with projects in Guatemala, Mexico, Jamaica andTanzania, and plans to begin working in a village in India thissummer.   The organization will sponsor 18 trips to the five countries thisyear, bringing 170 to 200 volunteers from around the United Statesto work for up to three weeks on projects the villagers in eachcountry have selected.   ``We do whatever it is the villagers ask us to do. They decidewhat gets done,'' said Philbrook, a St. Paul attorney. ``We putourselves at their service, but we work hand in hand on theproject.''   Though the work can be hot and the hours long, volunteers arefinding such projects a welcome alternative to traditionalvacations. Costs of the trips, ranging from $1,150 to $2,800 for thevarious sites, are tax deductible if a volunteer doesn't take extratime away from the group for pleasure.   The volunteers come at the invitation of host organizations suchas churches or government agencies in each country, and GlobalVolunteers tries to send groups to each of the villages four times ayear, Philbrook said.   ``For many people, a Peace Corps commitment of two years is toolong,'' Philbrook said. Global Volunteers gives those people achance to contribute in a developing nation without giving up theirlives at home.   The program is open to anyone, and volunteers need not speak thenative language. Volunteers have ranged in age from 15 to 73.   ``There are no skill requirements. We've learned that everybodyhere can make a contribution,'' Philbrook said.   Volunteers have planted trees, dug trenches for water pipes andworked with farmers identifying crop diseases and demonstrating moreeffective ways of applying fertilizers. Health care professionals onthe trips have gone with local nurses to make house calls onpatients.   ``We're very cognizant about the issue of dependency. We're notcreating dependency,'' Philbrook stressed. ``We never take control.It's never our project. It's always their project.''   Terri Hudoba, who traveled to Jamaica with Global Volunteers inNovember 1984 and December 1986, said she made her first trip partlyout of ``the old '60s hippy guilt feeling of socialresponsibilities.''   Hudoba, who works in the Minnesota House of Representativesinformation office and is now on the 40-member Global Volunteersboard, spent her time in the Jamaican village of Woburn Lawn helpingvillagers with paperwork necessary to set up a coffee farm, haulingconcrete blocks to a school construction site and working on bylawsfor a new cooperative being set up in a nearby village.   Those experiences have affected her reactions to poverty andstrife at home and when she takes pleasure vacations.   ``The people have faces to me now when I go on other vacationtrips. That has a profound impact on me,'' said Hudoba, adding thatshe is more sensitive to ``the way we deal with so-called`minorities' at home.''   Nancy Hall, who traveled to Guatemala with Global Volunteers inApril 1988 and will make her second trip in March, worked with picksand shovels to level land for a central plaza in San Miguel deConacaste, where Global Volunteers also has helped villagers fix upa building for their preschool program.   ``The kids are so precious! I'm just dying to get down there andsee them again,'' Hall said. ``The hope is in the children.''</TEXT></DOC>
