RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to block alawsuit by a Philadelphia man whose daughter was placed in thefederal witness protection program without his knowledge.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments aimed at givingfederal officials greater protection against being sued.   Anthony Prisco sued two former attorneys general and anotherfederal official in 1985. He said his rights were violated when hisdaughter, Lauren, now 9, was moved to a new home with her mother,Maria, and her mother's new husband, Michael Morris.   The Priscos were divorced in 1983 after six years of marriage.Prisco's ex-wife remarried, and soon after Morris was assigned tothe witness protection program. He had cooperated with the FBI inan investigation of organized crime's drug trade in thePhiladelphia area.   Under the government program, such cooperating witnesses andtheir families are given new identities and relocated to protectthem from retribution.   Prisco, with the help of a private investigator and a lawyer,tracked down his daughter. He later won shared custody of Lauren.When his ex-wife died, Prisco was granted full custody.   Prisco sued William French Smith, who was attorney general whenLauren was relocated in the witness program, and Edwin Meese III,who held the position when the suit was filed.   The witness protection program is run by the U.S. MarshalsService, and its director, Stanley Morris, also was named as adefendant.   The three defendants sought to have the suit thrown out onimmunity grounds, arguing they should be shielded from such claims.   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them lastJuly.   The appeals court said it was premature to consider the appealsby Morris and Meese, who was still attorney general last July. Anyconsideration of whether they enjoy immunity must wait until aftera trial on the lawsuit, the appeals court said.   Justice Department lawyers, in seeking Supreme Court review,said barring federal officials from appealing prior to trial willchill their freedom to make policy decisions.   The 3rd Circuit court acknowledged that the rationale for givingsuch legal immunity ``is that we do not want officials to makediscretionary decisions with one wary eye on their pocketbook.''   But the appeals court said Prisco's suit also seeks a courtorder to prevent public officials from violating his rights in thefuture. Since Prisco seeks more than money, the case against Meeseand Morris must proceed to trial, the appeals court said.   It said the suit against Smith raises a different issue becausehe had left office before Prisco sued and thus no longer was in aposition to violate Prisco's right to know the whereabouts of hisdaughter.   But the appeals court rejected Smith's arguments that he isentitled to legal immunity because at the time Lauren was assignedto the witness program, a father's constitutional right to be toldof his daughter's relocation had not been established by the courts.   ``Smith's contention that Prisco's rights to some form of noticewas not clearly established in 1983 is totally unpersuasive,'' theappeals court said.   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers alsoargued that Smith lacked personal involvement in the Prisco case _and therefore should not have to face a potentially costly judgment.   Prisco ``alleged nothing more than that Smith had supervised theDepartment of Justice during the relevant period,'' the governmentlawyers said.   The case is Smith vs. Prisco, 88-1039.</TEXT></DOC>
