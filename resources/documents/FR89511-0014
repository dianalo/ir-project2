Telephone (202) 732-1938.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Indian Education Act (The Act)was amended and reauthorized by Part C of Title V of Pub. L. 100-297 (AugustusF. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School ImprovementAmendments of 1988). The Act subsequently was amended by Pub. L. 100-427.These regulations incorporate technical amendments to the Act.The discretionary grant programs include support to Indian-controlled schoolsfor enrichment projects; planning, pilot, demonstration, and service projectsto meet special educational needs of Indian students; educational personneldevelopment projects; support for gifted and talented programs for Indianstudents; and projects for adult Indian education.On November 16, 1988 the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemakingfor these programs in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 46404-46409).The only differences between the NPRM and these final regulations are minortechnical corrections.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, several commenterssuggested changes to certain provisions of the Indian education regulationsthat were not the subject of the proposed rulemaking. The Department cannotissue final substantive changes to provisions that were not the subjectof proposed rulemaking and, therefore, were not made open to the publicfor comment generally. For this reason, these comments are not addressedin the final regulations. However, the Department appreciates the suggestionsand will consider them for future rulemaking on the provisions discussed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Content Requirements</ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter stated that former andSection;andSection;253.20, 254.20, 255.20, 256.20, 257.20 and 258.20 should be retained sothat grantees and potential grantees can know the application content requirementsprior to the availability of application packages. It was noted that applicationcontent requirements may not be limited to the requirements stipulatedin the authorizing legislation and, therefore, potential applicants maynot be able to anticipate the requirements. Potential applicants, however,often need to know, before application packages are available, what theapplicant content requirements are in order to decide whether to applyfor grants and to prepare for participation in the grant competition ifapplication is to be made.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The former andSection;andSection; 253.20, 254.20, 255.20,256.20, 257.20 and 258.20 were deleted in the NPRM because the informationcollection requirements in those sections are either statutory or basedupon requirements contained in other applicable regulations which the Departmenthas not proposed to delete. The application package does not contain requirementsbeyond those in the statute and other existing regulations. Therefore,the Secretary considers the inclusion of those requirements as separatesections in the regulations to be duplicative and unnecessary.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>Other than the Indian-Controlled Schools_Enrichment Projects, the Giftedand Talented Program, and the Educational Personnel Development Program,the programs covered by these regulations are subject to the requirementsof Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objectiveof the Exectuive Order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership anda strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State andlocal governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financialassistance.In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact</ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested commentson whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States.Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Parts 250 and 252 Through 258</ITAG>Education, Elementary and secondary education, Grant programs_education,Grant programs_Indians, Indians_education, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers 84.061 Indian Education_SpecialPrograms and Projects; 84.062 Indian Education_Adult Indian Education;and 84.072 Indian Education_Grants to Indian-Controlled Schools)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
