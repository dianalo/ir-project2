Aghazadeh's comment was in stark contrast to Iran's earlier openrefusal to allow rival Iraq oil quota parity, which has been one ofthe chief stumbling blocks to an accord among all cartel members.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, stood at$13.99 a barrel shortly after 11 a.m. EST, up $1.01 from Monday'sclose.   Venezuelan, Indonesian, Nigerian and Algerian ministers weremeeting separately with representatives from the formerly warringgulf states to try to reach agreement before Wednesday.   Iran had previously threatened to increase its oil production ifthere is no agreement. The Iranian oil minister told reportersMonday the country is pumping well above the production quota set bythe 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The cartel is trying at its winter meeting, which officiallybegan Monday, to work out a new accord to restrain a production glutthat has sent prices downward.   Iraq is insisting it get the same quota as Iran, and refused tojoin the quota system now in effect because of this demand. Iranwants to retain its ranking as the No.2 OPEC producer after SaudiArabia.   The Saudi oil giant, which produces a quarter of the cartel'soil, says it will not join a new quota system unless all 13 nationstake part.   ``Everybody has indicated a willingness to be integrated (into aproduction pact), but to what extent they will cooperate now isunclear,'' said a senior delegate, who demanded anonymity.   A member of a key delegation said Aghazadeh has suggestedministers rework a proposal recommending OPEC boost its officialoutput ceiling, which now excludes Iraq, from about 15 millionbarrels a day to a minimum of 17.4 million barrels.   The higher ceiling would make room for Iraq, allotting it thesame share of 2.4 million barrels a day now held by Iran. Iraq'scurrent cap is 1.5 million barrels a day.   Aghazadeh, according to the senior delegate, suggested thatrather than giving the same quota to Iraq, the cartel divide theadditional production between Iran and Iraq. Both want more money tohelp rebuild their war-damaged economies.   That would give Iran a quota of about 2.9 million barrels andIraq presumably about 2 million.   That scenario _ apparently rejected by other ministers _ showsAghazadeh's unwillingness to give in.   He told reporters Monday that Iran could boost oil production tomore than 4 million barrels a day within a year.   He said the country currently is pumping more than 3 millionbarrels a day.   Analysts, however, have estimated Iran's production at 2.3million to 2.5 million barrels.   They estimate Iraq is producing at least 2.6 million barrels aday, an amount that could reach 3.7 million barrels in mid-1989 whena new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea is completed.</TEXT></DOC>
