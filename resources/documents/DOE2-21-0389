<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0389 </DOCNO><TEXT>A documented start-up and acceptance-test procedure ensures that all componentsof a solar energy system operate as designed and specified. An acceptancetest plan should clearly define expected system performance in termsof mechanical performance, thermal performance, or both. The plan shouldinclude all new and existing subsystems associated with system operation.Energy-collection (collectors, pressure relief valves, air vents, expansiontanks, etc.), energy-transfer (pumps, piping, heat exchangers, flow-measuringdevices, control valves, etc.), energy-storage (storage tanks, pressure-reliefvalves, etc.), and energy-delivery (heat exchangers, heat pumps, chillers,etc.) devices all should be included in the test plan, along with allcontrols associated with their operation. This chapter summarizes visualinspection, pre-operational testing, and operational testing procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
