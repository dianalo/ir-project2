said Chris Date, executive vice president of Coddand Date International, a relational database consulting firm, &quot;but when IBMendorses a technology, people pay attention to it.&quot;andM;Date made a point of noting that &quot;there probably is no such thing as theultimate distributed database system.&quot;andP;  During DB/Expo 89, San Francisco, hedefined such a package as &quot;a system involving multiple sites, connectedtogether in a communications network, in which each site is a database systemsite in its own right and in which a user at any site can access any data inthe network as if the data were all stored at the user's own site.&quot;andM;IBM HAS INVESTED HEAVILYandM;&quot;Distributed database is an area of heavy investment for us,&quot; said Jnan Dash,manager of data systems strategy at IBM.andM;Dash compared distributed data and dispersed data saying, &quot;both involve datain more than one computer system, but dispersed data is generally inherited[by MIS directors].&quot;andM;Distributed systems move data to where it is required, under the control ofIS departments, Dash said.andP;  &quot;Distribution without direction can set an MISdirector's teeth on edge.&quot;andP;  He said careful implementation of a distributedsystem can avoid the dispersed data situations which are developing because&quot;LANs are much more real now.&quot;andM;To be distributed, Date said, a database system has to be relational.andO;&quot;Distributed database systems are the most significant new developments inthe database world since the first genuine relational systems,&quot; he said.andM;Relational Technology, Inc., Alameda, Calif., was the first to market adistributed database product--Ingres/Star--which was introduced in May 1986.andO;Neighbor and rival Oracle Corp., Belmont, Calif., followed with the unveilingof SQL*Star in September 1986.andM;Both companies chose to use the word (and/or symbol) star in naming theirproducts, a decision observers trace to the code name for the long-runningIBM distributed database development project.andM;Similarly, Cognos Inc., Ottawa, has dubbed its distributed DBMS, introducedin 1988, as PowerHouse StarBase.andM;Cincom Systems Inc., Cincinnati, brought out version 2 of is Supra relationaldatabase system, which executes in a client/server distributed environment,last January.andM;&quot;When our star component is released,&quot; said Marco Emrich, Cincom's seniorproduct manager for database products, &quot;the distributed basis will already bethere,&quot; indicating that Cincom, like its database brethren, visualizes alongstellar lines when it thinks distributed.andM;IBM NOW INTO STARBURSTandM;IBM, on the other hand, seems to prefer to keep its stars in the laboratory.andM;While R Star ended as a research project with announcement of the distributedversion of DB2, it has been replaced by Starburst which, said RussellDonovan, IBM's database market support manager, is a project aimed atextending the distributed database concept across DB2, SQL/DS and OS2.andM;IBM seems content at this point to stick to talk among its own products in adistributed world.andP;  Others want to talk to IBM too.andM;&quot;Ingres has no desire to talk to Oracle and Oracle has no desire to talk toIngres but both want to talk to IBM,&quot; said consultant Date.andM;He noted that a gateway could be created that would make an Oracle site lookto an Ingres site like Ingres.andP;  However, such a product would be for one-waydata transfer only.andM;&quot;It could not say get ready to go both ways.andP;  There are significant technicalproblems to be solved before this can be done,&quot; Date said.andP;  &quot;However, thereare reasons to do it, and vendors will do it.&quot;andM;RELATIONAL REASONSandM;Date said all distributed database systems are relational for five reasons:ease of fragmentation; ease of recombination; requests have high semanticcontent; responses have multiple records; and requests are optimizable.andM;He said non-relational sites cannot be incorporated into a distributeddatabase system in the sense that its data could be made accessible from arelational interface and could have relational operations performed on it.andM;&quot;However,&quot; he noted, &quot;if the question is, can I do something useful in a DDBwith a non-relational database, the answer is probably yes.&quot;andM;Other DDB products currently available include Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAXData Distributor (released February 1987), NonStop SQL from Tandem ComputersInc. (March 1987) and Sybase from Sybase, Inc. (June 1987).andM;Date cited two more products that have been promised: InfoReach from theApplied Data Research operation of Computer Associates International Inc.,andO;Garden City, N.Y., and Reflex 3.0/DDB-4 from Nixdorf Computer, Inc. ofWaltham, Mass.andP;  He predicted that other distributed database products will becoming out soon from other vendors.andM;The language vendors are ready for the onslaught of distributed databaseproducts.andM;Natural Language, Inc., Berkeley, Calif., claims its NLI Gateway &quot;allowssimultaneous English language access to data residing on multipleheterogeneous databases through a single query.&quot;andM;Dynamics Research Corp., Andover, Mass., says Spock, its natural languagedatabase query system, makes a distributed database appear to be a singlesystem to users.andP;  It works with Oracle databases in the DEC/VAX environmentand will be available for Ingres and Sybase databases soon.andM;TRUE DDB FOUR YEARS AWAYandM;Barry Rubinson, manager of product architecture at DEC, said he sees true DDBwith remote data access as being four years away.andP;  &quot;We have had [data]snapshots and batch replication since 1987.andP;  Over time we will get moreinteraction but standards are needed.&quot;andM;He said the International Standards Organization's (ISO) Remote Data Access(RDA) standard will &quot;only work if every vendor implements it.&quot;andM;Date noted some potential disadvantages of DDB: implementation complexity,long-haul networks are slow, possible political problems and impact on localoperations.andM;IBM's Donovan warned that &quot;distributed can be extremely expensive because ofhigh communications costs,&quot; but added, &quot;high availability of data where it isneeded means you can do a lot of applications that couldn't have been donebefore distributed.&quot;andM;He advised care in architecting a distributed system.andM;Date offered 12 objectives that he said are worth considering in evaluating adistributed database system.andP;  He cautioned that not all are important to allapplications.andM;The objectives include: local autonomy; no reliance on a central site;continuous operation; location independence; fragmentation independence;replication independence; distributed query processing; distributedtransaction management; hardware independence; operating system independence;network independence and DBMS independence.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
