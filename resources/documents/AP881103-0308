MCI, the No. 2 long-distance company behind American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co., said the MCI Fax network would allow companies tomonitor their fax use better, get consolidated fax bills, and usethe storing and forwarding capabilities of MCI's computer-controlledphone network.   Fax users in the United States will spend $3 billion this year ontransmitting facsimile messages, most of it on long-distance calls,and the market is expected to grow to more than $9 billion by 1991,MCI said.   All fax messages are currently sent over regular phone networks,including MCI's. MCI said it hoped to grab a large chunk of thetransmission business because its costs will be about the same asnormal phone service.   No other companies are in a position to match the MCI offeringquickly, said William McGowan, the chairman and chief executive. Forexample, ATandamp;T is not set up to bill customers separately for theirfax use.   McGowan declined to predict how much revenue or market share MCIwould gain with its new service, but he said in an interview, ``Itcould have a dramatic impact on MCI. It tells us we were right tomake the investment we have over the last four or five years'' in acomputer-controlled network.   Using MCI Fax, someone could broadcast a fax message to hundredsof machines around the country and abroad simply by sending the faxto MCI along with its list of recipients. As it is now, a machinethat broadcasts a fax message is tied up as it sends it to onerecipient after another.   MCI's computers will allow someone to send a message by telex,electronic mail or personal computer and have it converted into afax message. Also, MCI can store fax messages and deliver them oncommand. Some of these services are already available on advancedfax machines.   The service is both national and international, and MCI said itwas accepting orders immediately for service to begin by the end ofNovember.   The creation of a facsimile network does not require laying anynew cables. Instead, MCI uses computers to ``carve out'' the networkfrom its existing computer-controlled network.</TEXT></DOC>
