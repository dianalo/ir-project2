But despite efforts to rush TV production since the writers' strike ended on Aug. 8, CBS won't have fresh programming fully in place for three nights of its seven-night lineup, on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays, until late November.    Nor will some of the most promising programs aimed at attracting the younger viewers that CBS badly lacks, and the age group that advertisers most want to reach, be ready until late November. That is more than two months after the fall TV season usually begins.    Still, the schedule announced yesterday by CBS leaves it in better shape than most in the industry had expected. CBS is in the weakest position among the three major networks, falling to No. 3 in total audience this past TV season. It lacks such special events as the Olympics to boost viewing this fall, and it is heavily dependent on one-hour series. One-hour shows have been delayed the most by the writers' strike.    All three networks have struggled to schedule new shows since the strike ended. General Electric Co.'s NBC will offer the most new programming at the earliest date, premiering half of its schedule by Oct. 3. The ABC network of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. said last week most of its comedies will air by mid-October, but it hasn't yet been able to schedule its one-hour series.    CBS's one-hour series will make their debuts sooner than expected: 11 of its 12 shows will premiere in October, starting with the renewed &quot;Simon andamp; Simon&quot; detective show on Oct. 8.    The week of Oct. 23, CBS will air season openers for six &quot;one-hours,&quot; including its three nighttime soaps &quot;Dallas,&quot; &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; a new western called &quot;Paradise,&quot; and two action shows, &quot;The Equalizer&quot; and &quot;Wiseguy.&quot;    But CBS must wait until mid to late-November to air the premiere episodes of three one-hour series that the network hopes will lure a new audience of young adult viewers. (Almost half the CBS audience is age 50 or older.)    Those shows include &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; (beginning Nov. 18) which appeals to young women touched by the romance of restraint between a woman lawyer and a gentle creature who lives underground; &quot;TV 101,&quot; (Nov. 29) about a high school's video newspaper staff; and &quot;Almost Grown&quot; (Nov. 28), which centers on a baby-boom couple's romance through the 1960s, '70s and '80s.    Among the eight new series on CBS, the two comedies featuring former co-stars Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore will make their debuts Oct. 26; the opening episodes of &quot;Dirty Dancing,&quot; based on the popular movie, and of the father-daughter comedy &quot;Close to Home&quot; will premiere Nov. 5; and the Candice Bergen-as-TV-reporter show &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; premieres Nov. 14. </TEXT></DOC>
