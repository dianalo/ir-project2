A spokesman for the company said the latest offer reduced the weekly amount each union member would pay for health insurance premiums and increased the wage package. &quot;We're extremely displeased,&quot; he said. &quot;We thought the offer addressed issues raised by the unions.&quot;    The Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have vehemently opposed any payment by employees for health care. A spokesman for the CWA in New York said that the union hasn't changed its position. Talks might end up in mediation, but there is no formal step in that direction.&quot;    About 60,000 Nynex employees -- about 40,000 CWA members and about 20,000 IBEW members -- are on strike in New York and New England. </TEXT></DOC>
