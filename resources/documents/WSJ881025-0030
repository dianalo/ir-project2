However, foreign exchange traders remain bearish on the U.S. currency in the longer term.    The dollar's rally came in Asian and early European trading. After stabilizing at higher levels, the dollar traded in narrow ranges throughout the New York session.    In late trading, the dollar stood at 1.7938 marks, up from 1.7775 marks late Friday in New York, and at 126.98 yen, up from 126.18 yen. Sterling was quoted at $1.7475, down from $1.7605 late Friday. In Tokyo on Tuesday, the dollar opened at 127.08 yen.    &quot;We're waiting to see what happens,&quot; said Robert Hatcher, corporate dealer with Barclays Bank in New York. &quot;In the longer time frame, everybody is still very bearish on the dollar, but in the short-term, we had a big move down Friday which could not be continued.&quot;    &quot;This is a welcome respite after last week's move down,&quot; Mr. Hatcher said and termed the dollar's rally a &quot;technical correction.&quot;    In what was widely seen as the Japanese central bank's clearest signal since the beginning of the dollar's decline in October, a Bank of Japan official, in his regular daily contact with Japanese commercial banks, reportedly warned a senior currency dealer at a large Japanese bank against excessive dollar-selling.    The Bank of Japan official reportedly said the central bank is &quot;ready to do what's necessary&quot; to support the dollar.    The comments were made as the dollar approached the 126-yen level and helped reverse its direction in Asia trading.    &quot;I think they {the Bank of Japan} are trying to send a message to the market that they don't want the dollar to go any lower,&quot; said John Lyman, senior corporate dealer with Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. He added, &quot;I see it as a fairly strong commitment&quot; to contain the dollar's decline and prevent damage to Japanese exports.    Mr. Lyman said he thought the Bank of Japan official's comments, in conjunction with other factors, will be effective in stabilizing the dollar in the short term.    Despite the rally, Mr. Hatcher of Barclays said market participants will remain bearish on the dollar for a while.    &quot;We've seen some reduction in the short positions, but market feels that betting against the dollar is the right way to go,&quot; Mr. Hatcher said. He added that traders want to define the lower end of the trading band set up by the Group of Seven industrialized nations and will continue to sell the dollar in a slow, cautious fashion until the central banks are drawn into the market to defend the dollar.    The Bundesbank has remained conspicuously absent from the foreign exchange market during the dollar's recent decline, but Robert Ryan, foreign exchange manager with Irving Trust Co. in New York, said, &quot;I don't think the Bundesbank is a prerequisite for stability&quot; on the lower end of the dollar's range.    &quot;In very general terms, the Bundesbank will define the topside of the dollar and Bank of Japan will define the bottom side of the dollar,&quot; Mr. Ryan said.    Although the announcement of third-quarter U.S. gross national product tomorrow is expected to be relatively bullish, traders say the market's reaction so far indicates people will remain short dollars.    &quot;If people were positioning themselves for the GNP numbers, then the dollar would have had a bit more of bounce to it,&quot; said Joe Cally, a trader with PBTC International Bank in New York. &quot;People are going to go into the number basically short of dollars.&quot;    A strong GNP number, one indicating U.S. annual growth above 3.2%, may be used as an opportunity to drive the dollar higher and then sell it, Mr. Lyman said.    The dollar also was helped when the Bank of England moved to support the pound in cross-trading by buying sterling against the mark when the pound was trading at 3.1325 marks. The action stabilized the pound against the mark, and helped push the dollar higher by braking the West German currency.    &quot;Now that Bank of England has made its presence felt, the market may be more cautious of selling off the pound,&quot; Mr. Hatcher said.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $405.80 ounce, down $2.60. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $405.90 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
