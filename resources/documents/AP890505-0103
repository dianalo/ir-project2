A Palestinian guerrilla officer in south Lebanon said three WestGerman relief workers were seized in connection with the Hamadicase. He said two were freed today but that the third was stillheld.   There was no confirmation of the report.   ``It has already been said several times that the work of thecourt cannot be influenced by such events,'' Chief Judge HeinerMueckenberger said in a brief telephone interview.   Hamadi is on trial in Frankfurt in connection with the hijackingof TWA Flight 847 on June 14, 1985. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethemwas killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. Hamadiadmitted taking part in the kidnapping but denies killing Stethem.   Prosecutors have urged a murder conviction and life sentence,and the judge has said a verdict could come this month.   Shortly after Hamadi's arrest in January 1987, two West Germanswere seized in Lebanon. A pro-Iranian group, Holy Warriors forFreedom, claimed responsibility for the abductions and said theireventual releases were a ``goodwill gesture'' to win a lenientsentence for Hamadi.   Hamadi's elder brother, Abbas, was convicted in West Germany ofthose kidnappings.   Mueckenberger said he was not familiar with all the details ofthe latest incident in Lebanon, which apparently began Thursdayevening.   The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia in Lebanon said HeinrichStruebig and Petra Schnitzler were released at 5 a.m. today. 1stLt. Maarouf, a Palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of securityat the base where the two work, said the West Germans ``told methat the kidnappers are keeping their colleague Marcus Michael ...in connection with the case of Mohammed Ali Hamadi.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hanns Schumacher, said only thatthe trial ``could lead to a threat against Germans, that is clear.But everything else is pure speculation.''   He noted that Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler ``disappeared for acertain period of time and then suddenly reappeared'' in April1988. He said the government had no information about Michael.   His comments prompted the ARD television network to comment inits 1 p.m. newscast: ``The federal government obviously has doubtswhether the two actually were victims of a kidnapping.''   ARD claimed the government believes it is ``peculiar'' that in1988 the pair disappeared under similar circumstances andreappeared a short time later.   In 1988, Steubig and Ms. Schnitzler were thought to have beenkidnapped and held two days, but the humanitarian group for whichthey work, Asma-Humanitas, denied they were taken hostage.   It said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with theirdisappearance apologized after discovering their identities andsheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area.   Another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Rainer Mueller, saidofficials had warned Asma-Humanitas workers many times about thedangers of working in Lebanon.   There are 15 foreigners held hostage there, including nineAmericans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
