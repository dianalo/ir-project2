About 1,000 fighters overran four government posts Sunday alongthe strategic 75-mile road near Sarobi, 30 miles east of Kabul,said Masoud Khalili, a spokesman for the powerful Jamiat-i-Islamiguerrilla group.   Earlier this year, Jalalabad was the scene of the bloodiestfighting in the rebels' 11-year-old war to topple successiveCommunist governments in Kabul.   Jalalabad, located 45 miles west of the Pakistan border, wasseen as a test of guerrilla strength following February'swithdrawal of about 103,000 Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.   But government troops dug in. Despite initial successes,particularly at the key Communist garrison town of Samarkhel nearJalalabad, the guerrillas were stopped at the heavily fortifiedcity limits.   Guerrilla fighters have closed the Kabul-Jalalabad highwayperiodically but have been unable to keep it closed beyond a fewweeks. The guerrillas' weapons supply will decide how long thelatest blockade lasts, Khalili said.   Khalili also said guerrillas still block the key Salang Highway,a critical supply route between Kabul and the Soviet Unionreportedly closed in mid-September.   The United States has sent millions of dollars in militaryhardware and humanitarian assistance to the guerrillas in the pastdecade. The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic``holy warriors,'' also are bankrolled by Saudi Arabia and otherArab states.</TEXT></DOC>
