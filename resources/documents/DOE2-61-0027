Aprior effort to extrapolate annealing data to long times used linearsystems theory or the convolution integral. Problems with the linearsystems theory approach are: the damage is assumed to be linear eventhough the experimental data show a saturation effect; the annealingfunction, which is to be combined with the dose rate, needs to be knownfor a very long length of time (i.e., a 5-year observation of the annealing);and to do the integral numerically using data requires large amountsof computation.</TEXT></DOC>
