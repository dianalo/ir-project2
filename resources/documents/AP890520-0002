The government sent in troops,but residents blocked army trucks and some soldiers turned backwaving victory signs.   Martial law began at 10 a.m. (9 p.m. EDT Friday) in eightdistricts in the central city, including Tiananmen Square, thecenter of the protests. No curfew was imposed, and no date wasgiven for lifting martial law.   Shortly after martial law took effect, military helicopters wereseen flying over the 100-acre square.   (ABC's ``Nightline'' reported that witnesses had seen policeclubbing protesters.)   The protesters, thousands of them on a hunger strike, haveoccupied Tiananmen Square for a week, demanding talks with thegovernment, a free press and an end to official corruption.   Three tanks just south of the square were being blocked by busesdeliberately placed across the road by protesters. No troops wereseen in the square, but medical workers were distributing gauze incase of a tear gas attack.   Premier Li Peng said the protesters threatened Communist Partyrule and were being manipulated by people who wanted to overthrowthe government.   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who opposed a crackdown,offered to resign but the party had not acted on his offer, sourcessaid.   The English-language China Daily still referred to Zhao inSaturday's edition as party general secretary. A reporter said hedid not know about Zhao's political status but had heard he wassick.   It appeared clear, however, that the moderate Zhao had lost outto the hard-line Li in the government's decision to confront theprotesting students.   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li signed the martial laworder to put an end to ``serious turmoil ... (that) destroyedpeople's life and social order.''   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong signed six measures forbiddingmarches, strikes, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets,spreading rumors, attacks on leaders and media outlets and ``anyother destructive actions.''   Chen said soldiers were authorized to take any measuresnecessary to maintain order in the city of 10 million.   In a separate order, he said foreign reporters were forbidden to``incite or instigate Chinese to to march'' and could not conductinterviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at governmentoffices, schools, factories and mines. ``Any violators will bestopped according to the law,'' the order said.   The government ordered the Cable News Network to halttransmissions, and the network had to end its coverage at about10:10 p.m. EDT. CBS and ABC also said officials cut off theirtransmissions.   CNN reported that even China Central Television, the state-runnetwork, had been shut down after the martial-law order wasbroadcast.   It was the first time martial law was declared in Beijing sinceCommunist China was founded in 1949. Beijing becomes the secondcity under martial law. Lhasa, capital of Tibet, has been undermartial law since March after anti-Chinese riots.   Soldiers began moving into the city from the east and westbefore dawn, but thousands of local residents poured into thestreets to surround troop trucks. They parked factory trucks andbuses across key intersections to serve as barriers, lifted lanedividers across the road and at some places formed human barricades.   ``We are people and you are people! Why do you have nofeelings?'' one demonstrator shouted at the troopers.   Military helicopters made repeated low runs over the city, arare sight.   About 15 trucks, each filled with about two dozen soldiers,turned around and drove back the way they came after about 500students and supporters surrounded them for several hours inwestern Beijing and urged them to leave.   ``You should think about what you are doing,'' one young mansaid earnestly, standing on a truck's rear bumper and looking inthe faces of about a dozen soldiers. No weapons were visible.   When the trucks turned around, the crowd cheered and somesoldiers smiled, waved and flashed V-for-victory signs.   More than 200 trucks and 50 vans filled with soldiers stillstood further down the road to the west, blocked by thousands ofprotesters. About 10 sat on the east side of the city, but a busparked across the road blocked the way.   President Yang Shangkun said the army's task was to protectimportant ministries and key installations.   Zhao was not visible in the audience as Li and Yang announcedthe troop deployment in a nationally televised address. Also notshown was senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, believed to be the mainforce behind the crackdown.   After Li's announcement, some students at Tiananmen Square saidthey would resume a week-old hunger strike, which had been calledoff late Friday.   Leaders said 200,000 demonstrators would participate, but manywere seen eating after the announcement.   Demonstrating students said they would remain passive ifsoldiers tried to move them and would continue their sit-in untilthe government agrees to a dialogue on reforms.   About 100,000 people were in the square, and an equal numberfilled nearby streets. Women cried, men yelled and loudspeakersblared. Police sirens wailed throughout the city, and one policevehicle chased several trucks of banner-waving student supporters.   Li announced the army's intervention in a speech to military andcivilian officials at the Great Hall of the People, which looks outon the square.   ``We must adopt firm and resolute measures to end the turmoilswiftly, maintain the leadership of the party as well as thesocialist system,'' Li said, speaking in an agitated manner andoccasionally waving his fist. He said Beijing was in a state ofanarchy.   The student protests, which began in mid-April, have evolvedinto a nationwide movement and represent the biggest show ofdefiance in China's 40 years of communist rule. They overshadowedthis week's historic visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   The students in the square drowned out the broadcast of Peng'sspeech by singing the ``Internationale,'' the worldwide socialistanthem. They also chanted, ``Li Peng, step down!''   Beijing university students began protesting for democracy onApril 15, after former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang died. Hewas ousted in 1987 for failing to crack down on earlier studentdmonstrations.   Non-students cheered the initial protests, but relatively fewtook part in the marches until the hunger strike began a week ago.Then, fearful for the students' lives and angered by thegovernment's refusal to talk to them, people from every walk oflife joined in.   Soldiers and police marched with the doctors, teachers, factoryworkers, schoolchildren and dancing troupes.   Protests also broke out in more than 20 other cities. Thelargest marches outside Beijing were in Shanghai.   An American witness said about 500,000 students and workersmarched Friday in Shanghai and that more than 500 students were ona hunger strike there.</TEXT></DOC>
