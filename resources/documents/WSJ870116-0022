The Air Force contract for 21 C-5B cargo planes completes the planned purchase of 50 aircraft. The contract also concludes a much-contested program for the Pentagon. Originally, the last batch was priced at $2.2 billion. The Air Force negotiated down the price, based on a recent appraisal of how much the aircraft should cost.    Meanwhile, the Air Force is still sifting through claims by Pentagon auditors that Lockheed improperly negotiated an earlier contract for the C-5B by failing to inform the government of hoped-for wage concessions, which the company eventually obtained. Lockheed has proposed extending the program, but the Air Force declined, choosing to proceed with a new cargo plane, the McDonnell Douglas Corp. C-17.    In other contracts awarded yesterday, Grumman Corp.'s Grumman Aerospace Corp. unit won Navy contracts totaling $237.7 million for developing F-14 and A-6 aircraft improvements.    Dynascan Services Co. received a $41.6 million Army contract for support services at the White Sands missile range, New Mexico.    GTE Corp. received a $30.4 million contract from the Air Force to provide an electronic training system for strategic air command bomber crews.    Avco Systems Textron, a unit of Textron Inc., was awarded a $27.3 million Air Force contract for MX ICBM reentry vehicle equipment, and General Electric Co. received a $27.2 million Air Force contract for such equipment.    Watervliet Arsenal received a $26.4 million Army contract for M-1 tank cannons.    Units of General Dynamics Corp. got contracts totaling $25.9 million for F-16 aircraft test support for the Air Force, and Phalanx air-defense gun systems for the Navy.    Westinghouse Electric Corp. received an $18.6 million Navy contract for ballistic missile-engineering services. </TEXT></DOC>
