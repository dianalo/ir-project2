Brodie said the costs to eachside in a nuclear war would be so high they would far outweigh any meaningfulpolitical goal. Nuclear weapons could only be used to prevent generalwar, not win it. Kahn, on the other hand, thought a nuclear war coulde won and that it is survivable. During the Carter administration, theKahn scenarios affected the thinking of the Defense people. They agreedthat the U.S. must develop plans and weapons to avoid cities while strikingSoviet military forces. The author says there needs to be a return toBrodie's ideas on nuclear war.</TEXT></DOC>
