The properties will be sold by the Tenneco Oil Co. unit of Tenneco Inc. American Petrofina is a unit of Petrofina S.A. of Belgium.    American Petrofina, a crude-oil and natural-gas exploration production and marketing concern, said the purchase includes 61 properties along the Gulf Coast of Texas. Both companies declined to disclose the amount of reserves involved.    The agreement, expected to be completed by Aug. 1, is unrelated to the recently announced sale by Tenneco of the Tenneco Oil unit. A spokesman for Houston-based Tenneco, a diversified natural-gas, shipbuilding and farm and construction equipment concern, said the pact with American Petrofina was part of an earlier restructuring by the company. </TEXT></DOC>
