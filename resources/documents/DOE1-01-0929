These bands are described by a tight-bindingHamiltonian with two base orbitals per site, explicitly including a localCoulombic repulsion. The base orbitals contain both a tetrahedral symmetryas well as a the Bloch's oscilatory factor. The particular case Si:Pis explicitly calculated. (M.W.O.).</TEXT></DOC>
