It seems to be convenient to strikea balance now and arrive at definite statements as to - the outcome ofa 12-year period of research and development in the field of renewableenergy sources - the technologies remaining to be developed and thosehaving reached a certain maturity already - future potential developmentsin the field of renewable energy sources from the point of view of relevantindividuals and institutions - consensus or diverging views - the evaluationof innovative and renewable energy technologies in view of the new conservationmindedness. In October 1986 the balance was submitted to about 60 representativesresponsible for scientific research, economy and administration. Theevaluations, modifications and supplementary proposals arrived at asthe result of several discussion sessions have been integrated into thesecond and at the same time latest version of the balance whenever integrationwas possible. The latest version aims at contributing to a rational,positive and realistic handling of the hopes lying in renewable energysources, as well as at being a convenient guide for future research policies.</TEXT></DOC>
