That maychange now with last month's approval by Parliament of asweeping privatization law that will make 4,500 largeindustrial enterprises valued at $130 billion available forpurchase by domestic or foreign investors. A law was alsopassed that will return as much as $10.7 billion ofnationalized property to private owners.   The privatization law is the work of Czechoslovakia'shard-charging finance minister, Vaclav Klaus, who has beencalled his nation's Milton Friedman. The Klaus plan means tofollow up the Velvet Revolution for political freedom with aneconomic one: a giveaway of 20% of the nation's capital toits citizens.</LP><TEXT>   This people's capitalism would mean that everyCzechoslovak, for a token fee, would receive a voucher givinghim or her the right to buy shares in state companies. Theremaining 80% will be offered to Czech and foreign investors,with employees in state firms and the former owners ofnationalized firms offered a discount price. Poland alsoplans an aggressive use of vouchers to shift assets into theprivate sector.   It is ironic that the landmark privatization bill passedat the very time that the simmering disputes between factionsin Civic Forum, the movement that led the inspiring VelvetRevolution, broke into the open. On Feb. 23, Civic Forumformally split into two parties. The umbrella movement thatended 40 years of communism can no longer contain the policydebates and everyday conflicts of a normal society.   The two factions divide roughly into free-market andsocial democratic groups. The free-market group that woncontrol of Civic Forum at its January meeting is led by Mr.Klaus. His opponents, clustered around such figures asForeign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, would be comfortable asliberal Democrats in the U.S. Both sides support the rule oflaw and the creation of a modern economy, but they differ onhow much freedom to allow market forces.   Although his plans have been delayed by months ofbureaucratic infighting, Mr. Klaus's vision forCzechoslovakia is clear. He wants &quot;a market economy withoutany adjectives.&quot; Yet for someone offering such stern economicmedicine, he still enjoys popular support. In the June 1990elections won by Civic Forum, he won more votes than anyother candidate. (President Vaclav Havel was not on theballot.) In October, Civic Forum delegates elected himchairman with 70% of the vote. A recent TV poll put him onlyfive percentage points below President Havel in popularity.   But many intellectuals in Civic Forum abhor &quot;Klauskrieg&quot;economics. In December, seven of the 10 ministers in theCivic Forum government formed a Liberal Club to supportpolicies &quot;that lessen the effect of the economic reforms onsocially weak groups.&quot; They wanted Civic Forum to remain asocial movement with a blurred, humanistic vision. The twosides had a showdown at a conference in January.   There Mr. Klaus won support from surprising quarters.Students from Charles University circulated a letter to Mr.Klaus that said: &quot;Is it not noteworthy that we, students, areturning to you and ideas of the right? In all industrializedcountries students are mostly to the left. They, of course,can afford this view, since they have not lived through 40years of plundering, 40 years of a leftist utopia. We seethat followers of the left are uneducable. . . .&quot;   After a spirited debate, Mr. Klaus won roughly 70%approval for his plan to turn Civic Forum into a realpolitical party with a firm, anti-socialist platform. ByEuropean standards, it is a strongly free-market document.&quot;We intend to totally depart from socialism in all itsforms,&quot; it proclaims. &quot;A symbiosis of central planning andthe market is not possible. . . . We reject `perestroika'types of regulated market economics.&quot;   The platform goes on to say that its vision ofCzechoslovakia is a society, the &quot;pillars of which areindividual citizens, families, townships, counties and thestate, in the above order. Free citizens are the source ofpolitical, economic and moral initiative.&quot; It calls for helpto &quot;the poor, sick, old or otherwise handicappedindividuals,&quot; but also says such help should not destroyindividual initiative. In foreign policy, the document isproudly pro-Western: &quot;The principal guarantor of freedom andpeace in Europe has been and continues to be the NATOalliance.&quot;   The platform also contains a rousing endorsement of&quot;radical privatization in all fields of industry, agricultureand services.&quot; &quot;Those who seek a Third Way between the marketand socialism should realize it leads to the Third World,&quot;Mr. Klaus told the conference.   The size of Mr. Klaus's victory shocked the Liberal Clubmembers. Foreign Minister Dienstbier mourned the loss ofCivic Forum's political virginity. &quot;We have come once againto having a party run by people who issue membership cardsand advocate adherence to an ideological program,&quot; he toldme. Klaus partisans replied that a normal democracy needspolitical parties that stand for something.   It was thus inevitable that Civic Forum would wind up inpolitical divorce court. The Klaus group will become a formalparty, and the Liberal Club will try to retain the flavor ofan umbrella social movement. President Havel says he won'tchoose sides now, though he is closer to the Dienstbiergroup. Neither faction will have the right to the prizedCivic Forum name, but both will remain in government untilnew elections are held next year.   Democracy is a fragile flower in Eastern Europe, even inCzechoslovakia where it has pre-war roots. It will likelyflourish only if the economies of Eastern Europe start toproduce real economic growth. While the arrival of genuineparty politics in Prague is welcome, one hopes that the keyeconomic reforms are solidly in place before politicalpassions begin to rule.   Still, the two halves of Civic Forum have enough in commonthat there is a chance their debates will mostly concernconflicting visions of how to make the economic pie bigger.If their debate is primarily over how to divide an economicpie that hasn't been allowed to grow, that is a recipe forpolitical as well as economic instability.   ---   Mr. Fund is a Journal editorial writer.</TEXT></DOC>
