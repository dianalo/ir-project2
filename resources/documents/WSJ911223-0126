A month ago, an administrative law judgerecommended an $89 million decrease.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We came out $131 million better than the administrativelaw judge recommendation,&quot; an SCEcorp spokesman said. &quot;Weintend to control expense levels to stay within the amountauthorized in the decision.&quot;   Edison said the increase, equal to about 1%, will go intoeffect in late January, along with other rate adjustments.The net overall increase, including an increase in fuelcosts, will be about 2%, the spokesman said.   In response to the decision, Moody's Investors ServiceInc. placed the utility's credit ratings under review forpossible downgrade. About $11.5 billion of securities wouldbe affected by any action.   Moody's said that &quot;the upward trend of debt in theutility's capital structure may be accentuated&quot; by the ratedecision. Edison's high level of purchased power expenses&quot;could act in the extreme to further weaken capital structureand depress interest coverage,&quot; the rating agency said.   The SCEcorp spokesman said the utility was puzzled byMoody's statement because, among other things, the utilityisn't experiencing any &quot;upward trend of debt.&quot; Edison looksforward to discussing these matters with Moody's analystssoon, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
