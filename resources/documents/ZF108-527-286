 Well, we'rehere to tell you that if you're a single user, upgrading today from yourfriendly ISA machine to a 32-bit bus architecture is simply a waste ofvaluable resources.andP;  No, we're not kidding.andM;And we're not just saying that the extra performance isn't worth the extramoney.andP;  Through rigorous testing at two PC Magazine locations--PC Labs in NewYork and PC LAN Labs in Florida--we found that in a single-user DOSenvironment, and in network setups with up to a dozen workstations, nosignificant performance premium exists.andP;  When you consider the relativelysmall number of add-in boards for EISA and MCA, these architectures seem evenless appealing.andP;  For now, and for some time to come, ISA is still your bestbet.andM;As for medium-to-large local area networks, EISA and MCA do have thecapability to add speed and functionality.andP;  But MCA's limited industrysupport and EISA's market immaturity are yet more deterrents to investing inthem.andM;You may find these conclusions heretical or even illogical.andP;  Read on to seewhy we feel so strongly.andM;THE THREE CONTESTANTSandM;The contenders for your choice of expansion bus are, of course, the classicAT bus lately known as Industry Standard Architecture (ISA), EnhancedIndustry Standard Architecture (EISA), and Micro Channel architecture (MCA).andM;The first two trace their heritage back to the expansion bus of the originalPC, the cobbled-together computer creation that was expected to sell barely100,000 copies to die-hard electronics hobbyists and IBM employees.andP;  Itsunexpected success ushered in the personal computer revolution--and the needto flood the market with machines actually designed to be business computers.andO;That effort first brought forth the AT with its improved, 16-bit expansionbus and ability to address 16 megabytes of memory (compared with the 8-bitbus and IMB limit of the original PC).andP;  The expansion bus these machines usedis now universally acknowledged as the industry standard (except, of course,by those with their own fish to fry and apples to bake).andM;Shortly after the AT was introduced and microprocessors moved intohigher-megahertz territory, the major shortcoming of the AT bus becameapparent.andP;  It was too slow to keep up with the memory needs of 80286microprocessors running faster than 8 MHz.andP;  Pushing the AT bus fasterwouldn't  work; companies like Dell Computer Corp. tried and discovered thatmost expansion boards failed at 10 MHz or higher.andM;Compaq Computer Corp. showed the world a better way with its FlexArchitecture, which separated microprocessor memory from the generalexpansion bus.andP;  Through a direct route to the microprocessor, memory couldoperate at speeds as fast as available chips would allow.andP;  All currenthigh-performance PCs now use a variation on this theme, packing megabytes ofdirect access memory on the system board and often adding proprietary slotsfor memory expansion.andM;This technique worked and still does.andP;  Even IBM now infuses its system boardswith 8 or more megabytes of fast RAM.andP;  But today's 80386 and 80486microprocessors hint at performance problems to come.andP;  The 16-bit data pathand 24-bit addressing of the AT bus cannot take advantage of the fullpotential of these newer chips, which prefer a 32-bit data path and 32-bitaddressing.andM;IBM's answer to the problems of the AT bus was the Micro Channelarchitecture, which brought a busload of disadvantages along with its greaterdata-moving capacity and other innovations.andP;  A total break with the past, theMicro Channel was (and is) incompatible with PC and AT expansion boards.andP;  MCAmay be technically advanced, but it makes designing expansion boards andcompatible computers aggravatingly difficult.andP;  And being laced withproprietary IBM technology, it bears a hefty price because of the royaltythat machine manufacturers must pay IBM to use the company's patentedhandiwork.andM;EISA was developed by the &quot;Gang of Nine,&quot; a consortium of leadingIBM-compatible PC makers led by Compaq Computer Corp., and was designed tooffer the power of the Micro Channel without its disadvantages.andP;  EISA'sforward-thinking features essentially duplicate those of the Micro Channel--asetup program, bus arbitration, shared interrupts--without the penalties.andO;After all, the EISA architects could look to the Micro Channel for guidanceas to what they could incorporate into their design.andP;  They benefited bothfrom hindsight and from the admonition followed by all leading reverseengineers and burglars: steal only the best.andM;While they were running the Micro Channel's specifications through the Xeroxmachine, the EISA architects also choreographed a new dance, thepatent-office sidestep.andP;  As a result of their fancy footwork, no royaltiesare required for using EISA technology (although other elements of EISAcomputers may require licensing and royalty payment).andM;For board designers, the best aspect of EISA is its backward compatibility.andO;EXpansion boards for the EISA bus don't have to be any more complex thantraditional ISA boards.andP;  Although advanced EISA board designs are about equalin complexity to their Micro Channel counterparts, ordinary PC board designsstill work for ordinary purposes.andP;  Engineers can get simple interface boardsto market without a struggle.andM;THE PROMISE VS.andP;  REALITYandM;If you've been listening to the deprecations the two competing advanced-buslobbies have been lobbing at one another, you've probably come to believethat the best reason for moving ahead to a new bus design is performancespeed.andP;  IBM insisted that the Micro Channel can run circles around ISA.andP;  WhenEISA was introduced, the Gang claimed greater speed than IBM had provided.andO;In answer, IBM infused even more speed into the Micro Channel (think of thenew design as &quot;Son of Micro Channel&quot; or &quot;Micro Channel II: IBM's Revenge&quot;).andM;According to the wild claims, these newfangled architectures could blast thetext of a business plan or a complete novel from board to board in a fractionof a second.andP;  An ordinary spreadsheet could flash through the system fasterthan a leap of faith.andP;  If you believe the proclamations of the new-buspromoters, you can only get top performance from your next computer using oneof their advanced expansion designs.andM;Unfortunately, specifications and reality coincide about as often as all themajor planets conjoin.andP;  While numbers don't lie, often they don't reflectreality or your own expectations.andP;  The big numbers touted by manufacturersfor expansion bus performance may not be relevant in everyday use of acomputer.andP;  In fact, they may turn out to be theoretical constructs that willnever be visible in the harsh light of the office--paper specs that are of novalue when you need to get your work done and done quickly.andM;WHAT LIES BEHIND THE NUMBERSandM;PC Labs set out to find the truth.andP;  Are the performance claims warranted?andO;What do they mean to you as a user?andP;  And which bus is really faster?andM;To answer those questions, PC Labs developed new benchmark tests forevaluating bus performance, then ran them on two groups of machines chosen tohighlight the differences among the buses.andP;  At one end were our controlgroup, which were &quot;uncooked&quot; factory-stock base machines, identical exceptfor their bus architectures; we stripped out all other differences.andP;  AT theother extreme, we selected machines from the top configurations of the majorvendors in each of the three bus categories, which we &quot;cooked&quot; by loadingthem with the fastest, cost-is-no-object performance-enhancing optionsavailable.andP;  We refer to these as our enhanced machines.andP;  These &quot;cooked&quot;computers were meant to probe the limits of the currently availabletechnology.andM;For the factory-stock machines, PC Labs chose the ALR PowerCache 4 (MCA) andALR PowerCache 4e (EISA), both from Advanced Logic Research.andP;  These twintowers are identical in microprocessor architecture and price ($14,989), andthey use exactly the same cache, related circuitry, and cabinetry.andP;  WEreplaced the 4e's Hitachi hard disk with the Maxtor hard disk from thePowerCache 4 to eliminate even slight differences in configuration.andP;  We alsooperated the 4e in a degraded mode as an ISA computer to complete thethree-bus comparison.andM;At the high end, the classic-bus choice was an Everex StepServer/StorageDimensions FileMaster--a 33-MHz 386-based networked file server($13,999)--which we also reconfigured and retested as a single-user system.andO;In this form it was equivalent to the Everex Step 386/33 ($10,697) with anadded Diamond Speed-STAR VGA video controller($590).andM;The Micro Channel standard-bearer was a $7,252 IBM 20-MHz 386-based PS/2Model 80 enhanced with a Core International bus-mastering hard diskcontroller (model CNT-MCA, $495) and 650MB hard disk ($3,295).andP;  For our LANserver tests (Network Throughput Under Load), we upgraded the unit from 2MBto 8MB RAM.andP;  (IBM's new 25-MHz Model 80-A31 became available too late to beincluded in these tests.)andM;The EISA performance engine was Compaq's top-of-the-line Systempro, a 33-MHzdual-386 network-server monster with its performance-optimizing disk array.andO;We tested this machine with its Intelligent Drive Array (IDA) for the LANtests, and we replaced the IDA with a Compaq external 650MB ESDI hard diskfor the DOS tests.andP;  (The Systempro is not designed as a DOS machine; the IDAlacks a DOS driver, and thus the overhead the IDA creates impairs systemperformance in DOS tests.)andM;We conducted our tests to represent today's prevailing PC environments:single-user PCs running DOS and network servers dishing up Novell's NetWare.andO;What this testing revealed was often unexpected.andP;  For example, we found noneed to factor out the differing microprocessor performance among thesystems.andP;  The bus (or what was connected to the bus) proved to be thegoverning factor, and once microprocessor performance passed a minimumlevel--approximately that delivered by a 16-MHz 386--results converged to adefinite limit.andP;  In other words, the tests zeroed in on the shortcomings ofbus performance, and the results were disconcerting.andM;THE PERFORMANCE PUNCH LINEandM;And the winner is .andP;  .  .  .  For speed alone, the bus race was a dead heat.andO;And for realworld value, ISA proved the best bet for single-user DOSapplications.andM;Information moved across each bus at about the same rate.andP;  With today'sapplications, your choice of bus makes virtually no performance difference,whether your PC is a world unto itself on your desk or a server handing offfiles to a dozen other PCs.andP;  Forget the claims and hype.andP;  The old classic ATbus still has a lot of life in it, enough that you'll not suffer for havingit inside your next PC.andM;We found that larger LANs are another story, with possibly a differentwinner.andP;  In this type of bus-crunching application, a sophisticated busdesign can really make a difference.andP;  In this capacity, MCA is slightly aheadof EISA, but each has its drawbacks in terms of industry support.andP;  Comparedwith ISA, a limited number of companies make boards for MCA machines, whichmay or may not influence your buying decision.andP;  As for EISA, the market is soyoung that boards that work at all are currently few, but the next yearshould see an influx of boards that support the Gang of Nine's venture.andP;  Awell-designed bus can't improve performance without a selection of additionalhardware that takes advantage of it.andM;TESTING STRATEGYandM;These conclusions were as hard to reach as they are to swallow.andP;  Although itsounds like sacrilege to recommend tired old ISA, this conclusion was borneout by some of the most extensive benchmark testing PC Labs has everperformed.andM;Our primary goal was to evaluate the effects of different expansion buses onactual computing chores.andP;  Instead of simply measuring bus operating speeds(just attaching a frequency counter will achieve that), PC Labs measuredactual throughput--how much data an application can move through the bus in aspecified period of time.andP;  Throughput, rather than theory, determines howmuch actual work your computer can do.andP;  The new benchmark tests were createdto measure the throughput of each major element of a PC system: themicroprocessor, the display system, the mass storage system, and the networkinterface.andM;The performance of the microprocessor and its associated memory were measuredby PC Labs' Dryshell Processor test.andP;  (Although this test doesn't measure busperformance, its results help us to sort out the results of other tests.)andO;This measure is based on Reinhold Weicker's Dhrystone test, originallypublished in the Communications of the ACM (October 1984), but modified sothat the test code would not execute solely from cache memory.andM;The name Dhrystone is actually derived from another performance measure, theWhetstone test.andP;  The wet/dry pun contrasts the different aspects ofperformance measured by the tests.andP;  The Whetstone test investigatesscientific and engineering processing capacity by evaluating mathematicalperformance.andP;  The Dhrystone measure looks at tasks more relevant to desktopcomputing: integer arithmetic, character-string handling, and function calls.andO;Even seemingly mathematically oriented PC applications such as Lotus 1-2-3rely almost entirely on integer arithmetic rather than floating-pointoperations.andM;Because the traditional Dhrystone test runs in a relatively tight loop, itshows few performance differences between systems that have the samemicroprocessors and clock speed but that use disparate caching technologiesand sizes.andP;  The tiny test simply runs entirely within the cache at the topspeed of the microprocessor.andP;  PC Labs' Dryshell Processor test compensatesfor the small computational kernel by duplicating itself four times anddividing up the work among four copies of its algorithm.andM;The Dryshell Processor test reflects the capabilities of the latest softwarefor high-performance computers, in that it was written using simulated 32-bitmathematical instructions.andP;  The test was compiled using Microsoft C, Version5.1.andM;To isolate the video system--specifically, VGA circuitry--from the rest ofeach computer undergoing evaluation, PC Labs developed a new measure ofdisplay speed called the VGA Controller Throughput test.andP;  This performancetest measures the display system's maximum throughput in kilobits per secondby repeatedly filling the screen with horizontal lines, rotating among 16different colors.andM;The VGA Controller Throughput test stressed the display system well beyondthe demand of any actual application.andP;  While the display speed of ordinaryapplication software is limited by the microprocessor time required togenerate screen images, the VGA performance test has no such overhead.andO;Consequently, it is essentially independent of the system's microprocessor.andO;For example, when we tried running the VGA test using the same video card inan 8-MHz 286 and in a 33-MHz 386, the results matched within 2 percent.andP;  TheVGA test does not measure text processing speed, because the time to refresha full character-based screen is minuscule compared with that required indrawing graphics images.andM;To separate mass storage performance from the rest of each system, PC Labsdeveloped the Disk Controller Throughput test.andP;  This performance test readsand writes a sequential file in blocks of a predefined size.andP;  Sequentialoperations using a large block size (32K in this evaluation) minimize themechanical limitations on hard disk performance--latency and seek times--andmaximize the amount of data flowing from the disk into the host computersystem.andP;  This allows the hard disk subsystem to push data across theexpansion bus as fast as it possibly can.andP;  This is a true test of busthroughput as you would see it in actual use.andM;We also tested Disk Controller Operations per Second using a small block size(512 bytes) to measure the performance of the hard disk controller bymaximizing the number of operations the controller needed to carry out.andP;  Ineffect, this test measures controller overhead as well as throughput.andP;  Usingstill smaller block sizes makes no sense, because the low-level format of PChard disks does not permit reading or writing less than a single 512-bytesector at a time.andP;  Reading or writing blocks smaller than 512 bytes primarilymeasures DOS and microprocessor rather than disk performance.andM;To measure the maximum possible throughput of network data, PC Labs installeda network adapter card in each tested system, which then received data sentacross the LAN in large blocks by three Compaq Deskpro 386/25s (with 3ComEtherlink II cards).andP;  The data transfers occurred as fast as Ethernet couldcarry them without packet collisions.andM;The sending and receiving programs established the NetBIOS sessions to carryout this exchange of data using the NetWare 2.15 IPX (Internet ProtocolExchange).andP;  Note that in evaluating test results the efficiency of theNetBIOS driver is as important to network throughput as the LAN card'shardware design.andM;We had no trouble running our Network Throughput Under Load tests, in whicheach tested system is configured as a server.andP;  But for the Network AdapterThroughput test, where the tested systems are set up as nodes rather thanservers, we ran into problems when trying to test the EISA bus.andP;  We couldfind only one EISA Ethernet board on the market designed for nodes, and itcould not complete our tests.andM;For our Network Throughput Under Load tests at PC LAN Labs, we set up each ofthe systems using NetWare 386, Version 3.0, and connected it to networks ofzero, three, six, and ten constantly active nodes.andP;  (One exception was theEverex StepServer/Storage Dimensions Filemaster, which warranted testingunder NetWare 286, Version 2.15, because the ROM in the high-performance harddisk controller was not yet compatible with NetWare 386.)andP;  The networkcarried out its transactions in block sized of 512 bytes, 4K, and 16K, and weconverted the transfer times into kilobit-per-second throughput figures.andM;PCs OF CHOICEandM;All of the PCs that were involved in these bus tests represent the state ofthe art in design technology.andP;  They use the latest, highest-performancemicroprocessors available--either 20- or 33-MHz 386 chips or 25-MHz 486s.andO;The machines were equipped with 2MB to 12MB of highspeed RAM connected tosockets on the system board or dedicated memory expansion boards rather thanthe normal system expansion bus.andM;None of these machines stoop to using an ordinary ST-506 hard disk; all optfor at least one ESDI disk.andP;  The Systempro uses a tightly knit array ofdrives to optimize mass storage performance (we used a solo 650MB ESDI drive,however, when evaluating the Systempro as a single-user system).andP;  As thetests demonstrate, any of these machines would be an excellent anchor to holda network faced by the most awesome gales of workstation demands.andP;  Forsingle-user situations, some of these machines are actually overkill; theSystempro's full features don't come into play until it starts servingnetworks.andM;The ALR PowerCaches 4 and 4e are the PC equivalents of the World TradeCenter--matched towers that are head and shoulders above all but a fewcompetitors.andP;  Each machine is based on a 25-MHz 486 (the fastest version ofthe chip available at test time) coupled with a proprietary cache design thatfeatures a 128-bit-wide data path and a full 128K of 25-nanosecond static RAMcache.andM;These two machines have identical hardware.andP;  Each tower measures 23.5 by 7.5by 18.5 inches (HWD), and each offers the same drive capacity.andP;  Fourhalf-height drives fit into bays at the top front of the case.andP;  A singleinternal full-height bay swings out on a clever, hinged panel.andP;  Each of thehalf-height devices mounts to an individually removable shelf.andP;  The internalhard disk screws to the swing-out panel through six shock mounts.andM;When fully assembled, the ALR tower cases are fairly sturdy, although likemost tower cases, they pale in comparison with the solidity of the Systempro.andO;For example, the ALR half-height bays are weakly mounted on one side.andO;Although these towers are structurally better than the company's pastefforts, they still lack the quality we have a right to expect in a $15,000computer.andM;The operating accoutrements of the two ALR systems are nearly identical aswell.andP;  The main switch for the 220-watt 115/230-volt power supply is at therear edge of the top of the case.andP;  Tiny power and drive activity LEDs arehidden at the top of the system's black sculptured front panel.andP;  Connectorsfor the standard input/output ports sprout from the center of the rear paneland include serial, parallel, mouse, and keyboard connectors (one of each).andO;Both systems come with VGA.andM;While the EISA machine uses a standard 5-pin DIN connector for the keyboard,the Micro Channel machine uses a miniature DIN connector exactly like that ofIBM's PS/2 series.andP;  The MCA tower comes with a 1.44MB 3.5-inch floppy diskdrive; the EISA machine is equipped with a 1.2MB 5.25-inch drive.andM;The primary difference between the twins is the system board that lines theright side of the case.andP;  The Micro Channel machine uses a 14.5- by 11.5-inchboard with a single proprietary daughtercard for memory.andP;  This board bearssockets for 16 SIMMs (single in-line memory modules).andP;  The system board holdssix Micro Channel expansion slots, two with full 32-bit connectors and fourwith 16-bit; two of the latter slots have the MCA video extension.andM;The PowerCache 4e EISA machine requires a larger system board measuring 14.5by 14 inches, overlaid with a second 12- by 7-inch board that chiefly holdsmemory--a total of 32 SIMM sockets.andP;  Of its eight slots, six use 32-bit EISAconnectors, one is 16-bit, and one is 8-bit.andP;  Both systems use Intel VLSIchips, a Phoenix BIOS, and a Dallas clock/CMOS module.andM;The exact match of these systems' architectures allowed PC Labs to controlall factors in system design, the only variable being the bus.andP;  In fact,during evaluation the same hard disk was alternately used in both systems toeliminate any differences arising from variations in disk performance.andM;Visually, EISA and MCA diverge most markedly in the size of theirmotherboards.andP;  The EISA motherboard is larger not because it is more complexthan its MCA counterpart, but because the expansion board is larger--as isthe slot--and requires a larger plane inside the machine.andP;  These differenceshave no effect on price, with one exception.andP;  The smaller MCA system boardfits in a desktop package, which lowers the cost of the ALR base system withmonitor from $11,989 to $10,489 (with a 120MB hard disk in lieu of the 150MBmodel that comes standard in the tower).andM;COOKED ISAandM;In the &quot;cooked&quot; category, the most mundane and least costly choice is theEverex Step 386/33.andP;  The company's basic configuration, with no hard disk,2MB of RAM, and a 64K cache, costs $6,299.andP;  The extra 6MB RAM, 330MB harddisk, quadruple cache, and Diamond SpeedSTAR VGA controller drive the priceup to $11,287.andM;Almost prototypical of the ISA school, the Step 386/33 looks like an ordinaryAT clone: its 6.5- by 21 by 16-inch case has an AT layout (three half-heightbays on the right, all with front-panel access, and a full-height internalbay).andP;  Inside, the 12-by 14-inch system board looks conventional enough withits pin-in-hole components, even the familiar Tadiran battery Velcroed to theside of the 200-watt power supply for maintaining the CMOS setup memory.andO;Most of the chips are PLAs (programmable logic arrays, standard chips thatcreate custom circuit configurations), making up for the dearth of VLSI onthe board.andP;  Memory is confined to the space behind the hard disk, where eightSIMM sockets are available.andP;  The 8MB system board capacity can be doubledwith a proprietary high-speed memory expansion board.andM;The standard eight expansion slots are installed, six with 16-bit interfaces,two with 8-bit.andP;  In the evaluation system, three were filled by a VGAadapter, a hard disk controller, and an input/output adapter with two serialand one parallel port.andM;The indicator panel that hides behind a sliding smoked plastic door in thefront panel distinguishes the Step 386/33.andP;  In addition to the expectedkeyboard lock and power and disk activity indicators, it also includes analphanumeric display and three LEDs to indicate speed.andM;The interior of the Step 386/33 is distinguished by its scalable memorycache, the component that makes the machine really cook.andP;  The Step 386/33runs at a higher-than-average bus speed of 11.1 MHz but will automaticallyswitch to 8.5 MHz if any incompatibilities arise.andP;  For testing, we used anoptional Diamond VGA adapter (which will be released by the time this issuehits the newsstands); it proved the fastest graphics board that PC Labs hasyet encountered--twice as fast as Compaq's integrated system board circuitry.andM;COOKED MCAandM;Our souped-up Micro Channel machine is IBM's veteran 20-MHz PS/2 Model 80enhanced with a 16-bit bus-mastering Core 15-MHz ESDI hard disk controllerand matching hard disk.andP;  Little changed from the original 16-MHz Model 80,the 20-MHz machine is built inside the same stalwart plastic tower that alsoserves as the foundation for the much-maligned Model 60.andP;  The 23.5- by 6- by19-inch case accommodates two 3.5-inch floppy disk drives on slide-infront-panel sleds and two full-height 5.25-inch drives in a subchassis frame(one with front-panel access).andM;The 11- by 15.5-inch system board is cleanly laid out in mostly surface-mountcomponents and IBM ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) thatincorporate VGA, serial and parallel port, and floppy disk control circuitry.andO;The eight expansion slots provide three 32-bit and five 16-bit connections,one of the latter having a video-extension connector.andM;COOKED EISAandM;Any way you look at it, the Compaq Systempro is an awesome machine, includingits $41,143 tested-configuration price (the base price is $15,999).andP;  Theintent behind its design is obvious: the Systempro is the ultimate PC.andP;  It isdesigned as a network server, and many of its advanced features (such as itsdrive array) won't come into play in single-user operation.andP;  No DOS driver isavailable for the drive array, so we conducted the single-user performancetests with a Compaq-supplied external high-performance hard disk.andM;That said, the Systempro looks as if it benefits from the craftsmanship ofout-of-work builders of tanks and battleships who were displaced by the peaceraging in Europe.andP;  Few mountains are as solid.andP;  The 23.5- by 7.5- by 22-inchaluminum chassis has its own unique design, with an angled set of bays forthree removable-media drives at the top and a hidden nest for eight harddisks inside the bottom.andP;  A 300-watt power supply fills the top of the case.andM;The Systempro's floppy disk drives are one-third-height devices (the 3.5-inchand the 5.25-inch drive in the evaluation system both used high-densitydisks).andP;  Only the first slot is actually one-third-height; the second bay ishalf-height, with a thin panel filling the gap between disk drive and bay.andP;  ADC-600-style streaming tape backup unit also graced the front panel.andM;The eight internal drive bays are not remarkable, but the drives' electricallink-up is.andP;  Multiple hard disks inside the Systempro can be synchronized tofunction as a single, large hard disk array using Compaq's Intelligent DriveArray Controller.andP;  The largest array currently available uses four disks toyield 840MB.andM;The system board inside measures 11 by 15.5 inches.andP;  Microprocessors--theSystempro can use one or two--reside on proprietary processor boards.andP;  Theevaluation system includes two 33-MHz 386 processor boards, one equipped withmatching-speed Intel 387 and Weitek 3167 coprocessors.andP;  Both CPU boards alsobear Intel 82385 cache controllers and 64K static RAM caches.andP;  A proprietarymemory board comes with two memory modules, each containing 2MB RAM.andP;  Anadditional dual-socket proprietary memory module containing 1-megabit (1Mb)chips holds an additional 8MB, yielding a total of 12MB RAM.andM;I/O ports (two serial, one parallel), a floppy disk drive controller, andfast VGA circuitry are built into the system board.andP;  Besides four proprietaryslots (three of which are filled, two with CPU boards and one with memory),seven full 32-bit EISA slots are located on the system board.andM;SUPRISING RESULTSandM;The single-user tests of these six systems confirmed past evaluations andexpectations as far as microprocessor and video performance are concerned.andO;The 486 microprocessor proved its mettle in the ALR machines, using its burstmode to blast ahead of 386 processors running at faster clock speeds.andO;Certain expansion boards shone, like the lightning-quick Diamond VGA adapterin the Everex machine--twice as fast as even the tightly integrated 16-bitVGA circuitry of the Systempro--while a vintage 8-bit VGA connection shackledthe Model 80 like a ball and chain.andP;  In fact, we found the Diamond VGA wasnearly 13 times as fast as the Model 80's video card.andM;As testing became increasingly bus-dependent, however, the differencesbetween the test machines evaporated.andP;  Put identical high-speed hard disks inmachines with the same microprocessors and cache architectures and the busdoesn't matter, as our three ALR machines demonstrate: with a few exceptions,the test results are nearly indistinguishable.andM;The bottom line for people using DOS applications is: put your money in goodvideo controllers, put your money in plenty of RAM, but don't spend more thanthe price of a good ISA machine to get a performance bonus from MCA or EISA.andM;Yet that's not the end of the story.andP;  Run NetWare on one of the evaluationsystems and link it to a number or nodes and you begin to see the differencesbetween architectures.andP;  To pursue this idea, PC LAN Labs ran benchmark testson each of the six reviewed machines.andP;  The EISA and MCA servers usedappropriate Novell 32-bit adapters, and the ISA servers used a 3Com 3C50516-bit adapter.andP;  The suite that provided the load for the servers includedfour 25-/33-MHz 386 PCs, two 20-MHz 386s, and five Dell System 200s with12-MHz 286 CPUs.andM;The results show that as servers, the MCA and EISA machines are a strideahead of comparable ISA systems, with MCA edging out EISA--given the networkadapters and driver software used.andP;  We should emphasize that a single tweak,like rewriting the driver software of a LAN adapter, could alter the EISA/MCAperformance relationship.andP;  But the general advantage of these busarchitectures over ISA in a heavy-duty server is logical and is supported bythe test scores.andM;These results also show that with today's level of CPU performance, the harddisk array remains the biggest bottleneck.andP;  The next most significantlimitations are imposed by the lan adapter and data bus; CPU power fallsafter all of these in the rank order of subsystems that influence serverthroughput.andP;  In the future, you'll run more applications on server CPUs andthis order of importance will change, but today you would be wise to spendyour server money buying disk, bus, and LAN adapter throughput.andM;UNFULFILLED PROMISESandM;Reconciling these results and the bus promoters' lavish promises of improvedperformance requires careful analysis of the technology, the claims, andtoday's applications.andM;The theoretical underpinnings of the claims are solid.andP;  Both EISA and MCAclaim to move bytes faster than could ever be possible in classic-buscomputers.andP;  The claims make sense for a number of reasons.andP;  First, both busespotentially double the width of the expansion channel, from the classic bus's16 bits to the full 32-bit capacity of today's latest microprocessors, theIntel 386 and 486.andP;  In addition, they alter the timing of the signals on thebus and the protocols used for transferring data across the bus.andM;The maximum speed at which classic-bus computers can transfer data betweenexpansion boards is 16 megabits (16Mb) per second.andP;  Each transfer requirestwo cycles of the bus clock; the 16-bit bus can move two bytes in thisperiod, and the typical maximum bus clock speed is 10 MHz.andP;  (Some machinesoffer higher speeds, but they may suffer compatibility problems with someexpansion boards.)andP;  The standard 8-MHz speed of the classic AT bus yields aslightly lower 64Mb per second maximum transfer rate.andM;EISA preserves the 8-MHz bus speed of the classic AT bus.andP;  (Because the EISAbus is generally operated synchronously with the system microprocessor, itsactual speed is usually a submultiple of the microprocessor clock; thus,25-MHz computers offer 8.33-MHz bus speeds and 33-MHz machines offer 8.25-MHzbus speeds.andP;  These fractional differences are negligible in terms of overallsystem performance.)andM;But EISA doubles the bus width, which immediately doubles the potentialtransfer rate (to 128Mb per second).andP;  It also includes an advanced operatingmode that allows transfers to be made at a rate of one percycle, achievingthroughput rates as high as 256Mb to 264Mb per second (depending on the exactspeed of the bus).andM;As originally conceived, the Micro Channel specification operated with 10-MHzbus cycles with a 32-bit data path and two cycles per transfer, achieving a160Mb-per second transfer rate.andP;  In the three years since its introduction,IBM has refined (read: changed) the MCA specification to add more transferspeed.andP;  Some 16-MHz (and potentially 33-MHz) machines can use a techniquecalled matched memory mode, which reduces the bus cycle time by 37.5 percentand commensurately increases data transfer rate.andP;  Using a technique calledstreaming data mode, the Micro Channel cuts the overhead to achieve a rate ofone cycle per transfer for the movement of sequential data.andP;  And bymultiplexing the address bus during streaming data transfers (using the 32address lines of the bus as data lines during the transfer), the MicroChannel offers what is essentially a 64-bit data path.andP;  together, theone-transfer-per-cycle rate, effective 64-bit bus width, and 10-MHz cycletime yield a maximum possible throughput data rate of 80MB per second.andM;Look at real-world issues and the expansion products that are availabletoday, and the claims disappear faster than spirits exposed to sunlight.andP;  Forexample, no available PC hardware can take advantage of the Micro Channel'sstreaming data modes, and only memory boards have been designed to usematched memory mode.andP;  Similarly, EISA's high-speed data transfer protocol hasyet to see commercial application.andM;Bottom line: today the two buses have effectively the same data transferrate, 20MB per second (assuming a 10-MHz cycle time in each case).andP;  This is,in fact, only a doubling of the transfer speed of the classic AT bus.andP;  Onceyou consider that precious few 32-bit expansion boards are available foreither advanced bus design, one fact stands out: even today, after threeyears of development and hype (in the case of the Micro Channel, at least),for practical purposes you'll win no raw performance advantage by using anadvanced expansion bus.andM;As severe as the limits today's hardware impose on the expansion bus mayseem, they pale in comparison to the inherent data throughput restrictionsimposed by existing hardware standards.andP;  Because of these standards, evenexisting PC expansion boards do not push the classic AT bus to its limits.andO;For example, the fastest PC expansion option you're likely to install is anESDI hard disk.andM;The current top throughput rate for an ESDI drive is 20 megabits per second(at 20 MHz, the latest technology).andP;  Network adapters load the expansion buseven less.andP;  For example, the fastest as Ethernet adapter can possiblytransfer data is 10MB per second.andP;  Because of Ethernet's operating overhead(messages are sent as separate packets, with dead time between to allowmultiple adapters to arbitrate for network time), a real-world network cannotattain even that speed except for short, packet-length bursts.andP;  The classicAT bus as it currently exists has more than five times the bandwidth requiredto sustain these worst-case loads.andP;  Clearly, the bus is not the performancelimit with this hardware.andM;BOARD PLAYandM;The conclusions derived from these numbers are obviously contrary to thepractical experience of anyone who has plugged boards into a high-performancecomputer.andP;  For example, an 8-bit hard disk controller board is likely to turnin performance far worse than a 16-bit controller.andM;A number of factors contribute to the real-world performance differenceyou'll see when shifting from an 8-bit controller to a 16-bit controller.andO;The biggest limit is imposed by the disk controller itself.andP;  If an expansionboard cannot keep up with the rest of the computer system, it adds waitstates to the system's operation.andP;  In fact, many system boards automaticallyadd wait states to transfers from 8-bit expansion boards to insure that thesystem doesn't overwhelm the laggardly electronics of the expansion board.andO;That's a key issue: expansion boards and not the expansion bus today createthe most bothersome slowdowns in bus performance.andM;The Micro Channel attacks this problem head-on: you simply cannot use old,slow expansion boards in a Micro Channel computer.andP;  Instantly the speed limitimposed by old boards is broken.andP;  the penalty, of course, is that you cannotuse older boards--even the quickest old boards--at all.andP;  But while youcertainly won't want to plug a nine-year-old, performance-robbing serial cardinto a state-of-the-art 486-based PC, there are a lot of ISA expansion boardsthat you might want to use.andP;  Even after the three years that MCA has been onthe market, the variety of boards available to fit classic-bus expansionslots is still many times greater than the number of options for MCAboards--and some rate as speed demons in their own right (for example, theISA Diamond VGA adapter).andM;EISA gives you access to any old board you want to plug into your system--anoption you won't want to exercise indiscriminately for performance reasons.andO;But the capability is there.andM;NO ONE'S MASTERandM;Besides raw speed, the two new expansion bus designs also offer an advancedfeature called bus mastering.andP;  The concept of bus mastering is elegant; itseparates a computer's microprocessor from the expansion bus and in effectmakes the chip work as if it were an expansion board itself.andP;  That puts themicroprocessor and all the expansion slots on an equal footing and lets othermicroprocessors (or other devices, such as Direct Memory Access controllers)take direct control of the bus.andM;Having the microprocessor yield up control of the bus is much like having acorporate executive delegate authority to a department manager: the executivehas more time to take care of other work.andP;  Relieved of the responsibilitiesof bus control, the microprocessor in a bus-mastering system has thepotential to carry out its functions faster.andP;  Moreover, the mastering designallows many separate but equal (or even unequal) microprocessors to beplugged into expansion slots.andP;  Such designs can theoretically offermultiprocessing and parallel processing inside the chassis of a single PC.andO;With several microprocessors passing data around, an increased bandwidth iscalled for, probably more than the classic AT expansion bus can supply.andM;Bus mastering is thus the best justification for the existence of advancedbus designs and their very high bandwidths.andP;  Unfortunately, the number ofMicro Channel bus-mastering expansion boards available today is minuscule,particularly when you consider how long Micro Channel computers have beenavailable.andP;  This scarcity presumably stems from several causes.andO;Bus-mastering expansion boards are inherently more complex and difficult todesign.andP;  Soldering some components to a sheet of glass epoxy is just notenough.andP;  Bringing a bus master to life also requires programming expertise todevelop the software that controls its operation.andM;The market for bus-mastering expansion boards is also small, giving boarddevelopers less incentive to develop new products.andP;  The total installed baseof Micro Channel computers in the United States is about 3 million--versusaround 23 million classic-bus computers.andP;  As we go to press, the installedbase of EISA computers numbers in the thousands.andM;Even if you should find and buy a bus-mastering expansion board for yourcomputer, you're apt to be disappointed.andP;  You won't see much of a peformancedifference.andP;  DOS and bus mastering are contrary concepts.andP;  DOS harks back tothe days when it was amazing that a personal computer could do even one thingat a time.andP;  DOS forces programs that execute under it--which means every oneof the significant PC applications you can buy today--to serialize all oftheir input and output operations.andP;  All the data that's pushed across theexpansion bus has to march under the gun single file.andM;WHITHER TECHNOLOGYandM;Notwithstanding all of the above arguments, advanced bus designs are not thework of the devil.andP;  Nor are they are fraud foisted off on unsuspecting usersby snake-oil salemen.andP;  They do offer a substantial technological leap aheadof the classic AT bus--which means that a very limited quantity of currentsoftware and expansion hardware can take advantage of them.andM;Just remember that the classic AT bus is far from dead, and it remains aviable option for expansion, with the possible exception of high-endnetworks.andP;  While you won't be disappointed in the performance of either anEISA or Micro Channel personal computer, an ISA machine will do the job justas well and will far broader industry support and hardware options.andM;If you're opting for the most cost-effective high-performance strategy withtoday's DOS or smaller LANs, your best bet is to stick with the classic ATbus; as for the additional $1,000 to $2,000 you'd have paid for anadvanced-bus computer, you can invest it in memory.andP;  Use the extra RAM as asoftware disk cache; you'll see more of a performance increase than you wouldget with the most advanced bus-mastering disk controllers, even those with ahardware cache.andP;  Should you change over to an advanced operating system,those extra bytes of RAM won't be wasted.andM;If you're in the market for a network server, even a 12-MHz 286 computer willdeliver adequate performance, assuming that your LAN does not include morethan a dozen workstations.andP;  (Strange as it may seem, you're likely to needmore processor power in workstations than in the server!)andP;  Remember, NetWare286, Version 2.15, runs in protected mode, so the advantage of using NetWare386 is small (about 10 to 15 percent in PC LAN Lab's testing).andM;Large networks are another story.andP;  Along with multisystems--multitasking,multiuser, and multi-microprocessor computers--large networks benefit fromthe new bus designs.andP;  The software you need to tap that performance has beenslow in arriving, but software has to come of age sometime.andP;  Even smallnetworks will someday need more server power as more system functions are runon the server.andP;  When network monitoring, managing, or communications softwarelives on the server, you'll need all the processor power you can get.andM;Next on the PC Labs Bus Wars agenda is a test of the three bus architecturesrunning under OS/2 and Unix, providing you with the picture outside the DOSworld.andP;  By the time we finish, EISA may have done some growing, so that wecan cross off the unavailability of boards from its list of troubles.andP;  Fornow, stop kicking yourself for not investing in the new and improvedarchitectures for a single-user DOS environment.andP;  You can do without thebruises, and so can your wallet.andM;Winn L.
