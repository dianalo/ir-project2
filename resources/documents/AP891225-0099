Justice Minister Antoine Komi Sambo told a news conference``foreign mercenaries'' were among those arrested, but he refusedto provide any details.   He said those arrested would be brought before the courts ofthis landlocked West African former French colony, once known asUpper Volta.   Burkina Faso, with a population of more than 8.5 million, gainedindependence in 1960.   In Paris, the Burkinabe League of Human Rights issued astatement protesting the arrests and what it called repression bythe country's ``military dictatorship.''   ``As of Dec. 25, more than 50 people have been arrested, andtheir number is likely to double in the days to come, according todisquieting information coming from Burkina Faso,'' it said.   Earlier Monday, the French news agency Agence France-Pressequoted what it called well-informed sources in Ouagadougou assaying seven people were executed Sunday night and Monday morning,and about 30 others, mostly soldiers, were arrested.   Compaore took power Oct. 15, 1987, in a military coup that leftPresident Thomas Sankara among those slain. Officials reportedanother aborted coup last September and said four alleged plotterswere executed summarily, including the men who were No. 2 and No. 3in Compaore's government.   The justice minister did not disclose on Monday when any of thelatest events took place, nor did he disclose any details of thecoup attempt.   The League of Human Rights, a Paris-based group of Burkina Fasoexiles, said it had no further specifics on the attempt.</TEXT></DOC>
