The proposal, opposed by some union leaders, is part of a64-page report that was handed to the president Wednesday by theNational Commission on the Public Service. The report lists ways tomake federal service more attractive.   The commission, a private body with a number of former orpresent federal officials among its 36 members, concluded that thepresent system of trying to make government salaries uniformnationwide and comparable with private industry pay is unworkable.   It recommended instead ``a pay-setting system that recognizesthe fact that public employees live and work in localitiescharacterized by widely different living costs and labor marketpressures, and adjusts compensation upward accordingly.''   ``Under such a system, federal employees would continue toreceive the same base pay for the same job, but in large areas ofthe country many would also receive an allowance designed tocompensate for higher living costs and labor competition,'' thecommission said.   Its report said the latest survey by the Bureau of LaborStatistics shows that government employees' pay lags behind that ofcomparable workers in private industry by a national average of 22per cent.   ``The commission believes the president and Congress must give ahigher budget priority to civil service pay,'' the commission said.   But, the report added, ``it is no longer appropriate or workableto use a national average to establish an appropriate level ofpay.''   ``The world of work has changed too much for such a broadapproach,'' it said, citing wage surveys that show geographicdifferences of more than 30 per cent in some cases for similar jobs.   ``These locality and occupational differences seriouslyundermine the fairness of the current civil service pay process,especially when all federal employees receive the same pay whetherthey work in low-cost areas such as Kansas City or Norfolk, Va., orhigh-cost areas such as San Francisco or Boston,'' the commissionsaid.   Douglas Fraser, a former president of the United AutomobileWorkers who is a member of the commission, said organized laborgenerally supports the commission's report but is opposed tolocality pay.   ``It creates in many cases gross inequalities,'' Fraser said.   Spokesmen for government unions also reacted coolly.   John N. Sturdivant, national president of the AmericanFederation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, said, ``Before thecommission addresses the issue of locality pay for federal workersas suggested by this report, steps must be taken to close thecurrent 22 percent pay gap.''   Robert M. Tobias, president of the National Treasury EmployeesUnion, said the report contained ``no systematic program to remedythe pay crisis'' for government workers.   ``The report holds out the false hope that pay increases can beabsorbed in current agency budgets and through reductions inforce,'' Tobias said. ``That premise is a sure road to furtherdemoralization and eventual chaos in the work force.''   The commission also recommended pay increases for members ofCongress, federal judges and top federal officials, designed tobring their purchasing power back to its 1969 level by the time thenext Congress meets in 1991. The commission said their purchasingpower has declined 35 per cent in the last 20 years.   Bush, receiving the report, said: ``This is very timely. In thenext few days, I'll be making some very specific proposals.''   He did not say what the proposals would be, and White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to elaborate.   Fitzwater said today that by signaling plans to submitlegislation, Bush on Wednesday had meant to say that he would besending Congress his proposals on a new ethics law.   The spokesman said that Bush would most likely have a publiccomment at that time on the pay issue. But he said that ``it hasnot been decided yet whether that would be a pay raise for federal,congressional and judiciary, just judicial, or whatever.''   ``It's unlikely that he would have anything to say aboutcongressional pay raises, but he will have comments about judicialpay raises as it relates to ethics legislation,'' Fitzwater said.   He said that Bush ``will not have specific proposals onlegislation on any pay raise for anyone within the next week ortwo,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
