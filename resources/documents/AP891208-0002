Four of the disgraced former Politburo members were thrown injail pending an investigation. Honecker, who underwent gall bladdersurgery last summer, was too ill to be jailed and remained underhouse arrest, prosecutors said.   After decades of hearing their leaders say the West was poisedto plunder the Communist nation, shocked East Germans have grownincreasingly angry as they have learned the extent of theplundering from within.   During a parliament session Dec. 1, one lawmaker alleged formerofficials stashed $54 billion in Swiss bank accounts.   Prosecutors have not confirmed that figure, but there have beennearly daily revelations of corruption and lavish living by thecountry's former hard-line leaders.   The latest comes with the opening of criminal investigationsagainst Honecker, 77; former Premier Willi Stoph, 75; and fouraging cronies.   Four of the six former Politburo members already are in prison,said prosecution spokesman Peter Przybylski. Former Politburomember Hermann Axen, 73, was having an eye operation in Moscow.   ``They are accused of damaging the economy of the GermanDemocratic Republic and of personally enriching themselves by abuseof office and corruption,'' Przybylski said.   The charges carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.   Those arrested were Stoph; Guenther Kleiber, 58; WernerKrolikowski, 65; and Erich Mielke, the 81-year-old former chief ofthe once-dreaded secret police.   Przybylski did not say when the trials would take place, addingthat police had searched the suspects' homes. He also did notspecify their alleged crimes.   For weeks, officials have been disclosing how the oustedleadership lived lavishly with the best imported goods and hadfancy hunting lodges, while the state-run news media has spoken offortunes smuggled abroad.   Honecker and other former Politburo members already were underhouse arrest in their exclusive compound outside East Berlin.Honecker was ousted as party leader on Oct. 18 and all were laterexpelled from the party.   Three other former Politburo members already had been imprisonedon suspicion of corruption.   East Germans also are reeling from the scandal involving thenation's former chief foreign trader, AlexanderSchalck-Golodkowski, who surrendered to West Berlin authoritiesWednesday.   Schalck-Golodkowski is accused of running a ring that illegallysold weapons to countries in South America, Africa and the MiddleEast.   He insists he is innocent, but has agreed to pay back $31million. That's only a fraction of the sum East German news mediasay he may have embezzled.   His deputy, Manfred Seidel, was arrested and charged withsmuggling out $110 million. Another figure connected to the scandalhas committed suicide, the official news agency ADN said.   The allegations are particularly embarrassing for a country thatroutinely has said it is short of desperately needed Westerncurrency.   Also Friday, the Christian Democrats said investigators hadfound the party's former leader, Gerald Goetting, responsible forfinancial irregularities. The allegations were turned over toprosecutors for possible criminal charges.   The Christian Democrats are one of the four smaller parties thatrecently broke a decades-long alliance with the Communists.</TEXT></DOC>
