In some of the biggest price moves since the Persian Gulfwar ended, crude oil was up between 25 cents to as much as $1a barrel in European and U.S. cash and futures prices, whilefuels rose one cent to two cents a gallon or more.</LP><TEXT>   Oil traders said the catalyst for the price rise was thesurprising drop in U.S. inventories of crude oil and gasolinereported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday afterfutures markets had closed. According to the API, crude oilinventories fell 5.1 million barrels last week to 336.4million, while gasoline stocks plunged 4.9 million barrels to206.5 million.   The results put crude oil inventories 34.5 millionbarrels, or 9.3%, below the year-earlier level. And it leftgasoline inventories 19 million barrels below those of a yearearlier and only marginally higher than the minimum operatingtotal the industry estimates is necessary to avoid tightsupplies and possibly some shortages.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for Maydelivery broke through the technically important level of $21a barrel to settle 79 cents higher at $21.05. May gasolinewas up 2.19 cents a gallon to 70.67 cents. May heating oilrose 1.47 cents a gallon to 56.02 cents.   Prices also rose in other markets. Leading U.S. refinersincreased their field postings for West Texas Intermediate,the U.S. benchmark crude, between 70 cents and $1 a barrel.Cash prices for North Sea crudes were up 25 cents to 65 centsa barrel in European spot markets. And on London'sInternational Petroleum Exchange, which launched trading in anew naphtha contract yesterday, crude oil futures closed 60cents higher.   Some analysts noted that once prices had broken throughcertain resistance points for crude and fuels, technicalfactors took over, adding to the momentum.   &quot;The market has been fairly technical this week, but themain motivating feature was the APIs,&quot; said Ann-LouiseHittle, a senior oil and gas analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers in New York. &quot;Underlying that,&quot; she added, &quot;wasconcern about the threat to the Soviet Union's oil exports,including the possibility of an oil workers' strike andgeneral economic and political uncertainties.&quot;   Another factor cited for the return of petroleum prices tothe highest levels since mid-February was last week's bigadvance in refinery utilization. According to the API report,U.S. refineries operated at 84% of capacity, an increase of2.7 percentage points from the preceding week.   Analysts suggested that the gain in refinery utilizationindicated that the spring maintenance shutdowns -- or&quot;turnarounds&quot; -- had ended. Analysts quickly translated thisdevelopment into prospects for higher demand for crude oil.If refiners follow the pattern of the operational increasesof a year ago, &quot;we will probably see them increase theircrude runs around 1.5 million barrels a day over the nextfour months,&quot; said Peter Beutel, director of the energy groupat Pegasus Econometric.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Unusually large hog slaughtersexerted downward pressure on pork belly futures prices, whichtumbled 1.72 cents for the May contract, slightly shy of thetwo-cent daily limit. During the first three days of thisweek, 964,000 hogs were slaughtered, compared with 833,000during the comparable three days last week and 947,000 duringthe same three days a year ago. In addition, the hogs beingkilled are heavier than usual, which produces a big supply ofpork and pork bellies, or uncured bacon. The large supply isset against a backdrop of sluggish demand for pork and otherred meat, as is usually the case in April. &quot;The market istrying to get the pork belly price down to levels where thefresh bellies can be moved into cold storage,&quot; said JerryAbbenhaus, analyst for A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons in St. Louis. TheMay pork belly contract settled at 62.65 cents a pound, whilethe price of the June live hog contract fell 0.77 cent to56.70 cents a pound.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices in New York followed the rally inoverseas markets. After trading as high as $1.0975 a pound,copper for May delivery ended at $1.09, up 1.85 cents. Pricesabroad were pushed higher with heavy buying by Japaneseinvestors in the Tokyo market and options-related buying inLondon, traders and analysts said. The New York marketfollowed with a strong opening, and prices rose further onbuying based on technical factors. Producer selling pushedthe price off the day's high, they added. One analyst saidcopper prices got added support from reports of supplydisruptions caused by rail strikes in West Africa. ButHerbert Rhodes, manager of commercial metal services at ATandamp;TNetwork Cable Systems, said the West African news didn'tappear to affect the market when it came out around midday.Mr. Rhodes thinks prices will continue trading in a range of$1.05 to $1.10 for a while. Fred Demler, metals economist atPaineWebber, said that if copper breaks the $1.1025 level,prices could rise as high as $1.12. Expectations of lowerinterest rates and an improved economy, along with tightcopper scrap supplies and consumer stocks, are bullish forcopper, he said.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices partly recovered from early losses,but still ended lower. After trading as low as nine cents apound, sugar for May delivery finished at 9.11 cents, 0.16cent lower.   Analyst Sandra Kaul of Shearson Lehman Brothers tied thedecline to liquidation by investors who were disappointedthat increases early in the week didn't continue. HarriSchwartz, an analyst at Cargill Investor Services, suggestedthat sugar's weakness was caused by currency arbitragetrading, as the dollar's strength spurred investors to sellsugar in the U.S. and buy in London.   Judith Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said tradersperceive that there's now more than enough sugar availablefor delivery against the May contract, unlike in March whenthere were concerns of tight supply. She predicted the pricewill continue to weaken.   Mr. Schwartz thinks the price will continue to fluctuatearound nine cents. &quot;The market seems very comfortable at thislevel,&quot; he said, adding that he doesn't see anything on thehorizon that will cause the price to move sharply away fromcurrent levels.</TEXT></DOC>
