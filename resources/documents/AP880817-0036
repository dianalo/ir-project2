So hostile was the exchange Tuesday that police intervened andescorted the demonstrators away. One demonstrator later wasarrested and booked for disturbing the peace.   As soon as Bush began speaking at the rally alongside theMississippi River, the mostly young, male protesters locked armsand stood in a circle about 30 yards from the podium.   The demonstrators carried pink and green signs accusing theReagan administration of failing to fight acquired immunedeficiency syndrome, and chanted, ``40,000 are dead of AIDS _ wherewas George?''   Bush supporters shouted back, ``Bush '88!'' and surrounded theprotesters. Some Bush backers shouted obscenities and one reachedto tear down a protester's sign. Another man in the crowd pulledhim away saying, ``Don't do it, it looks bad.''   Police then hustled the demonstrators away. Bush did not stopspeaking or acknowledge the protest.   Earlier Tuesday, about 20 people staged a protest at a NewOrleans pharmaceutical company, IMREG, which makes one of the fewdrugs said to be effective against AIDS.   The point was to complain about government red tape, which hastied up approval of the drug for general use. That protest waspeaceful and concluded without incident.</TEXT></DOC>
