At the same time, Cox Enterprises Inc., the broadcast,newspaper and cable group, which already owns 12.5% ofTeleport, said it is studying whether to speed up exercisingan option to take control of the unit. Under the agreementannounced yesterday, TCI is required to purchase MerrillLynch's remaining 37.6% stake if Cox decides it doesn't wantit.</LP><TEXT>   Terms weren't disclosed.   &quot;It's an offensive move by cable companies that couldhaunt the Baby Bells for years to come,&quot; said Jack Grubman, atelecommunications analyst with PaineWebber Inc.   Teleport operates private optical-fiber communicationsnetworks in seven major U.S. metropolitan areas, carryingphone traffic for long-distance companies, large businessesand other organizations that send huge volumes of voice anddata messages. Teleport's networks primarily offer customersa way to keep phone traffic flowing in the event of a phonecompany outage.   &quot;This is clearly a statement that large cable companieswant to be in the telephone business,&quot; said Kenneth Leon, ananalyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;It presents a real threat tothe local telephone franchise.&quot;   Mr. Leon and others predicted the announcement would touchoff a bitter turf fight in Washington as the cable industryseeks ways to enter the phone business and phone companiestry to win the freedom to provide video services over theirnetworks. The 1984 Cable Act tries to keep the giantmonopolies separate by banning cross ownership, buttechnological advances are beginning to blur thedistinctions. The Teleport acquistion doesn't run afoul ofthat act because the company isn't classified as a commoncarrier.   TCI, the cable giant based in Denver, and Atlanta-basedCox have spearheaded testing technology that would enabletheir cable-television networks to carry telephone calls.Their purchase of Teleport would give both companiesmuch-needed expertise in leading-edge telecommunicationstechnology.   TCI has already started down that road. It owns so-calledfiber-loop operations in Chicago, Dallas and Seattle and istrying to buy Penn Access, a fiber-optic company inPittsburgh.   Both TCI and Cox also have been testing cable technologyfor carrying telephone calls. Last week, Cox demonstrated itsprowess with emerging pocket-phone technology by placing aphone call from San Diego to Federal CommunicationsCommission Chairman Alfred Sikes in Washington through acable-television system. Cox was the first cable company toget an FCC experimental license to test pocket phones, thenext generation of mobile-phone services.   John Dillon, Cox's senior vice president and chieffinancial officer, said the company is &quot;actively consideringwhether or not to exercise our option {to acquire control ofTeleport} early,&quot; although recommendations have yet to bepresented to the company's directors. Both the TCI and Coxtransactions will require state and federal regulatoryapprovals, and Mr. Dillon cited a benefit in presentingchanges to regulators all at once.   Mr. Dillon sought to play down the notion of competitionwith phone companies. &quot;Teleport isn't a direct competitor tothe phone companies,&quot; he said. &quot;It has built its business onnot being the local phone company.&quot;   Phone companies and analysts say the competitive threatmay be relatively small now, but it is certain to grow.&quot;Teleport has the ability to provide end-to-end service, nomistake about it,&quot; said Ronald Stowe, head of Pacific TelesisGroup's Washington office and head of the Bells' coalitionthat has been seeking to end restrictions on theirbusinesses. &quot;It should make policy makers more willing to letus into the cable business.&quot;   &quot;This just goes to show that the notion of competition isbecoming concrete,&quot; said Mr. Grubman. &quot;One of the reasonswe're negative on the Bells as stocks is that the local loopwill be up for grabs over the next few years.&quot;   Analysts figure that Teleport's annual revenues have grownto $100 million or more, a tiny fraction of the Baby Bells'$80 billion-a-year business. Teleport is the largest U.S.carrier offering customers a network that bypasses the localphone company; with new cable owners, it could grow muchfaster.   That's because competing financial-services companies arecertain to feel more comfortable using Teleport services onceMerrill Lynch is out of the picture. Also, the cablecompanies, which unlike Merrill Lynch don't view the phonecompanies as major customers, won't feel any compunctionsabout stepping on Baby Bell toes.   The significance of the transaction could be tested thisspring when Illinois regulators are expected to rule onTeleport's application for permission to offer more servicesto Chicago customers. In December, Teleport asked theIllinois Commerce Commission to allow it to interconnect withIllinois Bell, the local phone subsidiary of Ameritech Corp.   Teleport plans to resell Illinois Bell services and toprovide switched services, competing with the phone companyfor Centrex customers. To that end, Teleport announced a $1million project to build a central switching office indowntown Chicago. Teleport has such a switching office in NewYork.   Phone companies are hoping that nascent competition willspur regulators to lift decades -- old restrictions onpricing, services and lines of business. &quot;This is indicativeof increasing competition in telecommunications,&quot; said anAmeritech spokesman. &quot;We have seen it for some time, andregulators are now beginning to recognize it, too.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
