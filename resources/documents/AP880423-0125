At his office, the embattled attorney general faces a desk piledhigh with other policy questions, ranging from an intramuraldispute between the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service toinitiatives on drugs, pornography, gun control and the deathpenalty.   Meese's chief spokesman, Terry Eastland, says ``the attorneygeneral has indicated to anyone that has asked him that he ismoving as quickly as possible to make decisions on issues that riseto his level.''   But congressional critics pressing for Meese's resignationsuggest the tangle of ethical questions over his conduct andstaffing problems at the Justice Department are hindering hisability to tend to regular business.   ``I don't know how decisions can be made in a timely way in theenvironment that he faces, where senior staff has quit,'' said Sen.Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat whose Governmental Affairssubcommittee has held extensive hearings into Meese's affairs.   Detroit is focusing on Meese's statutory authority to decidewhether the city's two daily newspapers, the News and the FreePress, will be allowed to merge their business and productionoperations and share profits, a move they say is necessary toensure that both survive.   ``We have been in this process for more than two years now, andit is frankly a wearying, exhausting process, with everyone'sfuture on hold, and in fact with people not knowing if thenewspaper or they have a future,'' said David Lawrence, publisherof the Free Press. The paper's owners, Knight-Ridder Inc., say theFree Press will be closed if a joint operating agreement isrejected.   Meese, however, has said he will not discuss the newspaperquestion when he speaks before the Economic Club of Detroit. Hissubject will be drug control.   On that front, Meese has shaped several recommendations whichnow must be steered through Congress, including a law controllingchemicals used to process cocaine. He also seeks authorization toprovide better weaponry to drug enforcement officials in sourcecountries.   Meese also seeks death-penalty legislation for presidentialassassins and prisoners serving life sentences who kill guards,laws to modify the requirement that improperly obtained evidence beexcluded in criminal cases, stricter controls on pornography andobscenity, a ban on guns invisible to metal detectors and increasedfunding for prison construction.   Beyond broad issues, Meese also has several specific policydecisions to make, such as a 9-month-old dispute between the FBIand the Marshals Service over which should have authority to trackdown fugitives.   Meese this month testified before a grand jury in aninvestigation of a $40,000-a-year job for his wife, Ursula; hisinvolvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline, his ownership of$14,000 in telephone company stock and his ties to thescandal-plagued Bronx defense contractor, Wedtech Corp.   Two key Justice Department posts became vacant last month whenthe second-ranking official in the department and the head of thecriminal division both resigned abruptly.   In a meeting with President Reagan last Wednesday, one of thetwo, Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, told Reagan, VicePresident George Bush, and other White House officials that``Meese's behavior was hurting the Department of Justice,'' anadministration source said, speaking on condition he not beidentified by name.   ``I don't know how morale could not be affected by the massresignations and by the continual problems that the attorneygeneral faces,'' the administration official said. But Reagan,after a follow-up conversation with Meese, expressed continuedsupport for Meese.   The attorney general has said he spends virtually all his timeduring the work week to the business of the department, and asubstantial portion of the weekends.   But Levin said: ``I doubt that that's totally true. I can'tbelieve that given the amount of time that he has spent in front ofgrand juries and preparing for those visits, that all of that wasdone after office hours.''   Asked if Meese's legal and personnel problems had delayed theDetroit ruling, Eastland said: ``I just don't see that.''   The News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., and the Free Press soughtthe partial merger on May 9, 1986 under the Newspaper PreservationAct, designed to preserve newspaper competition in cities where onepublication is in danger of failing.   Knight-Ridder said in January the Free Press has had operatinglosses of $100 million since 1979, and the News in the same periodhad operating losses of about $75 million. The News is the nation'sninth-largest newspaper; the Free Press, the 10th largest.</TEXT></DOC>
