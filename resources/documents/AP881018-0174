Officials at Seoul's Yonsei University said the man wrappedhimself in a large South Korean national flag, shouted slogansagainst the United States and the government of President RohTae-woo, and then jumped.   They identified him as Kim Kyong-ku, 32, a laborer and said hewas hospitalized with two broken legs.   Ritualistic suicide is often used by radical students anddissidents in South Korea to dramatize their cause.   Elsewhere in the capital, about 400 students from Kyunghee andKonkuk universities hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police andshouted demands for withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops stationed inSouth Korea under a defense treaty, witnesses said.   They also demanded the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwanfor alleged corruption involving his seven-year administration.   Police reported no arrests or injuries in the two clashes, eachof which lasted more than one hour. Police used tear gas to keepthe students from marching into the streets and fighting wasconfined to school gates, witnesses said, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   Radical students say the United States supported Chun inmilitarily putting down the Kwangju revolt in 1980, the worst inmodern South Korean history.   In a separate incident, riot police moved in on blind protestersand arrested about 20 of their leaders Tuesday when thedemonstrators, shouting ``Don't take our jobs!'' tried to march inthe city's center.   Police beat several demonstrators over the shoulders with fistswhen they resisted arrest, witnesses said.   Riot police with shields raised moved in front and alongside the300 protesters after trying for more than four hours to persuaderally leaders to leave the middle of a 10-lane boulevard which runsthrough downtown Seoul. Most of the protesters were blind orvisually impaired and carried walking canes.   A spokesman said the protesters wanted the Ministry of Healthand Social Affairs to protect the jobs of masseur and masseuse,traditionally held by the blind in South Korea but now going tooriental herb doctors and sighted practitioners.   The 8th International Paralympic Games for the disabledcurrently are being held in Seoul and organizers said they timedthe demonstration to call attention to the blind workers' plight.   The spokesman spoke on the condition of not being identified, asdid the witnesses.</TEXT></DOC>
