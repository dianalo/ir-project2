From 1972 to about 1976, Jackie Presser, before he was president, allegedly received the cash kickbacks from the Las Vegas advertising agency, Hoover-Gorin andamp; Associates, according to court documents contained in the government's civil suit filed earlier this week in federal court in New York. Some of the details about the alleged kickback involving Hoover-Gorin were previously disclosed. The firm was hired by the union in 1972 to improve its public image.    The accusations are among several involving Mr. Presser, one of the 48 defendants listed in the Justice Department's anti-corruption civil complaint against the Teamsters. He is also accused of offering to pay money to Roy L. Williams, then a Teamsters vice president, to support a loan from the Teamsters' pension fund for a Las Vegas casino.    Mr. Presser, who is under federal indictment in a separate case in Cleveland for allegedly defrauding a Teamsters union local by hiring employees who did no work for the union, has never been criminally charged for any of the allegations in the government's civil suit. Neither Mr. Presser, who's on leave from the union for medical reasons, nor his attorney could be reached for comment.    To win its civil suit, the government, led by the efforts of U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, must prove at a trial a pattern of racketeering among defendants in the case, thereby portraying a rampantly corrupt union. To do this, the government in its complaint has documented hundreds of convictions of Teamsters-related crimes and dozens of allegations of racketeering against some defendants, including Mr. Presser.    Using the civil provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, or RICO, Mr. Giuliani said in an interview yesterday the government can cite earlier alleged activity as proof of a pattern of racketeering, as long as the most recent incident occurred within the past five years.    Mr. Giuliani said this is the case in the $300,000 kickback allegation against Mr. Presser. The government, in this case, didn't seek criminal charges against Mr. Presser before the statute of limitations ran out, said Mr. Giuliani.    &quot;It was something that was lost, that fell by the wayside due to a statute of limitations,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said. He added that the allegation wouldn't have been made if it couldn't absolutely be proven in court.    In August 1981, Labor Department investigators began looking into whether Mr. Presser, then secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland and also a Teamsters international vice president, received the kickbacks from Hoover-Gorin, which then had a $1.3 million contract with the international.    The probe was triggered by media reports. A Labor Department official overseeing the case was optimistic about getting an indictment against Mr. Presser. But the Justice Department closed the case in October 1982.    Mr. Presser testified before a Senate committee in 1983 that he didn't play a role in selecting Hoover-Gorin and that he didn't receive any money from the firm.    One former investigator who worked on the Presser investigation said the Justice Department's civil suit breathes new life into dormant investigations of the Teamsters leader. The ex-Labor Department investigator noted that the burden of proof required in a RICO civil suit is less than under criminal statutes. He said additional evidence against Mr. Presser should be easier to gain through pretrial depositions and discovery.    To successfully prosecute a civil RICO suit, only a preponderance of evidence is required rather than guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.    Some details of the allegations against Mr. Presser in the civil suit were previously disclosed in the 1986 report issued by the President's Commission on Organized Crime, said Randy Mastro, the assistant U.S. attorney on Mr. Giuliani's staff who is the lead attorney on the Teamsters case. He also said Mr. Presser took the Fifth Amendment after every question asked by the commission.    The questions had to do with several cases mentioned in the Justice Department's civil suit, including, for example, an allegation that Mr. Presser in 1972 offered to pay $10,000 to prevent a criminal prosecution against Mr. Williams, Mr. Presser's predecessor as union president. </TEXT></DOC>
