Great Lakes Chemical Corp., meanwhile, failed to meetearnings expectations while B.F. Goodrich Co. posted anexpected big loss after taking special charges.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   American Cyanamid                                                                                                          Bucking the downward trend of other major chemicalcompanies, the Wayne, N.J., company's earnings improved onflat sales of $1.13 billion.   Cyanamid said sales were damped by the U.S. recession'sdrag on its chemical group, which sells mostly specialtychemicals for industry use. Chemical sales were flat.   Those results were offset, however, by record sales atCyanamid's big medical and agricultural divisions, whichrepresent nearly 80% of the company's total sales. Themedical group was driven by worldwide sales of such productsas ethical pharmaceuticals, while strong sales of cropprotection chemicals bolstered results at its agriculturalgroup, the company said.   The earnings disclosure sent Cyanamid shares up 62.5 centsto close at $60.375 in New York Stock Exchange trading.                                                                                                          B.F. Goodrich                                                                                                          The Akron, Ohio, company posted a big loss after taking ananticipated special charge of $89.8 million, or $3.53 ashare, tied to the phasing out of high-cost production ofpolyvinyl chloride at three sites.   Even excluding the charge, Goodrich would have posted aloss of $16.9 million, or 75 cents a share. The company cited&quot;adverse economic conditions.&quot; Sales increased 5.5% to $607.4million from $575.8 million.   Goodrich shares fell 75 cents to $41.75 in New York StockExchange trading.   Like other chemical concerns, Goodrich's earnings areplagued by oversupply and sluggish demand for many commoditychemicals and plastics. The company's vinyl and specialtychemical operations were &quot;hurt by the recession&quot; and reportedlosses, Goodrich said.   The company's aerospace operations, meanwhile, postedimproved earnings.                                                                                                          Great Lakes Chemical                                                                                                          Earnings at this West Lafayette, Ind., company increased8% but fell short of per-share earnings expectations of 62cents to 65 cents, on a post-split basis. In New York StockExchange trading yesterday, Great Lakes shares closed at$54.625, down $2.875.   The company attributed the earnings shortfall to itsinability to close the acquisition of a majority stake inOctel Associates, a U.K. producer of fuel additives. Aspokesman cited &quot;technical factors&quot; that &quot;still need to beresolved.&quot; The company said it expects the transaction toclose in the &quot;near future.&quot;   Had Octel's earnings been included in the fourth quarter,Great Lakes per-share earnings would have &quot;fallen wellwithin&quot; expectations, the spokesman said.   Great Lakes said its bromine-based specialty chemicalbusiness thrived during the quarter, due to a healthy demandfor flame retardants and industrial water treatmentchemicals. However, the company said two subsidiaries werehurt by a stagnant worldwide foundry industry and depressedconditions in the U.S. oil and gas industry.   ---                            1991            1990                         in     per       in    per      %                      millions  share  millions share   chg.
