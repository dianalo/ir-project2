Gwartney</HL><DD> 03/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABOR </IN><TEXT>   The Economic Report of the President, released in January, contains an informative chapter on women in the labor force. It shows dramatic changes in the career choices of young women and the resulting changes in their earnings. The data suggest that women's nontraditional choices are accomplishing what the anti-discrimination laws of the 1960s and 1970s did not: shrinking the large earnings gap between men and women.    After stagnating for decades, the earnings ratio of women to men has been moving upward in the 1980s. The latest figures from the Census Bureau show that in 1985 women earned 65% of what men did. This compares with the 1960-80 period, when the ratio for full-time workers changed little, ranging from a low of 57% in 1972 to a high of 60%, which was reached several times during the two decades. This stagnation suggests that 1960s legislation prohibiting employment discrimination and in some cases mandating affirmative action did little to improve the relative earnings of women.    There are, however, sound economic reasons to question whether employment discrimination is the sole reason or even the primary one behind the male-female pay gap.    The very size of the earnings differential should give one pause. If an employer really could hire women willing and able to do the same work as men for 40% less, he would have a very strong incentive to do so. The average business earns a profit of 5% on total sales. Surely many employers would jump at the chance to cut labor costs by 40%. As more and more employers did this, the demand for women would expand. Women's earnings would rise and the earnings ratio would move toward parity.    A more convincing explanation for the differential lies in a married couple's traditional attitudes toward work -- attitudes that have persisted over a very long time, but show recent signs of change. Married men typically pursue paid employment aggressively when they are the family's primary breadwinner. To improve their earnings, married men are more likely than married women to accept transfers, pursue careers in which uninterrupted work experience is important, and accept jobs with long hours, uncertain schedules and out-of-town travel.    In contrast, women generally have had the primary responsibility for running households and caring for children. At least in the past, women have anticipated that they will interrupt their careers for various personal reasons. As a result, they tend to seek jobs with less travel and more flexible hours. They may also want jobs that will be available in a wide variety of locations so that if the family moves, they can enter the job market easily, with little reduction in earning power. Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that women have been attracted to nursing, teaching, secretarial and other jobs with easily transportable skills.    What evidence would support or contradict this hypothesis? Preferences cannot be easily measured, but we can compare the earnings of women relative to men according to marital status. The median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers who are female and married are only 60% that of married men. (If part-time, married workers are included, the ratio is 39%.) When single women are compared with single men, however, the ratio rises to 90% -- a much smaller difference in earnings.    Similarly, single men working full-time earn only 62% as much as married men. The logical conclusion is that a man with a wife to bear the greater share of their family responsibilities has more time to devote to his job, and the flexibility to adopt uncertain schedules or change locations, increasing his earning power.    Evidence is emerging that more and more women now plan for a long-term continuous attachment to the labor force, rather than merely intermittent periods of employment. The president's economic report this year says that among a national sample of young white women in 1979, 72% expected to be working at age 35, up from only 28% in 1968.    There also has been a dramatic change in the educational choices of women. Today, more women are preparing for high-skilled, high-paying professions. As recently as 1971, only 7% of the law degrees and 10% of the accounting degrees were earned by women. In 1985, however, women earned 38% of the law degrees and 49% of the accounting degrees. Similar changes have taken place in other professions, including medicine, architecture and engineering. Of course, these changes will exert their primary impact in the future, as women now entering the professions and planning for a more permanent attachment to the labor force acquire experience and move up job ladders.    However, as the recent evidence indicates, these trends are already making a difference. Paradoxically, at a time when many feminist leaders consider the political environment hostile, women's choices of occupation and work force attachment are propelling the relative earnings of women upward at last.    ---   Mr. Gwartney is a professor of economics at Florida State University.
