Their multibillion-dollar business with the two Middle East countries has been in a costly holding pattern.    Despite Iraqi attacks on Iranian territory over the weekend, the United Nations continued efforts to arrange a cease-fire prior to actual peace talks.    &quot;We have to watch conditions carefully,&quot; says Yoshitomo Takeuchi, head of the Middle East marketing and coordination department of Mitsubishi Corp., Japan's largest trading company. &quot;But if there is a cease-fire, money used for the war will become available and trading chances will improve.&quot;    Seoul's reaction was less restrained. Iran's acceptance last week of U.N. resolution 598, which calls for an immediate cease-fire with Iraq, sent the Korean stock market soaring. The Korean stock index rose a record 23 points Friday to close at 688 won. Shares of the major construction companies, Hyundai Group's Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co., and Daelim Industrial Co. rose the daily limit every day last week.    &quot;People expect good construction profits because of the cease-fire,&quot; says Lee Tae Jun of Seoul Securities Co. &quot;Construction companies are driving the market, along with banks, securities houses and trading companies.&quot;    The Overseas Construction Association of Korea estimates that Iran will invest $42 billion in reconstruction in the next five years, while Iraq will invest $29 billion. Korean officials estimate that Korean firms could win $1 billion to $5 billion of that work each year.    Japanese and Korean companies have waited a long time for peace. Throughout the gulf war, they have kept representative offices in Tehran and Baghdad while losing billions of dollars in unpaid loans and damages to oil refineries and other large-scale construction projects they were working on. Many Koreans and Japanese were injured and killed. On June 30, an Iraqi air raid on a Daelim refinery project in southern Iran killed 13 Korean workers.    Japanese and Korean companies say their perseverance during the bad times should give them first crack when times are good. &quot;There is a strong feeling among Japanese businessmen that, hey, we were there with you during the missile attacks,&quot; says Akira Mizuguchi, a project manager at the Middle East Institute of Japan, a government-sponsored think tank in Tokyo. &quot;We showed concern. Now we want to do business.&quot;    Consumer electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., for instance, kept its plant in Iran open despite bombing damage. Now the company expects domestic demand to pick up for the rice cookers and other appliances the factory makes.    With expectations high in Japan and South Korea, analysts expect fierce competition between the two for new business in Iran and Iraq. Indeed, the Koreans believe they have paid greater dues than the Japanese and can thus expect a greater share of business than they had during the boom years of the late 1970s and early 1980s.    &quot;We have a better knowledge of those countries than other countries that didn't work during the war,&quot; says Park Soon Chul, a director at the Korea Institute for Economics and Technology. &quot;Iran and Iraq are grateful for Korean loyalty.&quot;    Japan imports 68% of its oil from the Middle East, and since the first oil shock in 1973 has made strong efforts to cultivate friends and business there. But the Iran-Iraq conflict stalled most major construction projects, including the multibillion-dollar Bandar Khomeini petrochemical complex in Iran. A joint venture between the Iranian government and Mitsui andamp; Co., the giant trading house, has stayed only 85% completed for years since Iraq began bombing it. Chiyoda Chemical Engineering and Construction Co., a major exporter of oil refineries and petrochemical plants, is doing a feasibility study for an oil refinery in southern Iran, says a company spokesman. &quot;Right now it's only talk of peace, but if it becomes true we will send in more people,&quot; he says.    But the Japanese also realize that much has changed since the late 1970s when they were hard to beat in manufacturing and construction. The yen's surge in value against the dollar since 1985 makes Japanese products more expensive.    Perhaps more important, other Asian countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, have made great strides in manufacturing and technology in the past eight years. &quot;Japan will compete, but we won't be the only ones there,&quot; says a Mitsui official.    For South Korea, an Iran-Iraq cease-fire couldn't have come at a better time. Its construction, steel and heavy-equipment industries are looking for a way out of the building slump expected to follow the September Olympic Games in Seoul.    South Korean construction concerns became world-class competitors during the 1970s building boom in the Middle East. Profits from this work fueled much of Korea's industrial growth. Since the outbreak of the war, the Korean government has acted as a traffic cop, steering companies to one country or the other. A Korean press report says the major Korean construction companies have 20 projects worth $3.58 billion in Iraq; Daelim and Daewoo Corp. have four projects worth $210 million in Iran.    Companies that were routed to Iraq, such as Hyundai, South Korea's largest construction firm, have the most to gain from a cease-fire, because Iraq has often failed to repay loans. &quot;The cease-fire is heaven's blessing&quot; for Hyundai says Y.W. Kim, an analyst at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers.    Indeed, Hyundai has already started mapping strategy for new business in Iran and Iraq. &quot;If we manage it well, {the cease-fire} might become another opportunity to get out of the slump we have been suffering for a long time,&quot; says Hyundai Engineering President Chung Hoon Mok.    ---   Masayoshi Kanabayashi in Tokyo contributed to this artcle.
