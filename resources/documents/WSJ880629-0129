In fact, his standing is so high that he is the only cabinet member given a real chance of keeping his present job in a Bush administration.    But the unfolding defense-contracting scandal has taken some of the luster off Mr. Carlucci.    No one implicates him in the procurement corruption being investigated. &quot;Most of this must have happened before he ever arrived,&quot; Sen. Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, recently told reporters. But Mr. Carlucci was a central player in the Reagan administration's two previous campaigns to clean up the defense-procurement system. Amid the current allegations of bribery and bid-rigging inside the Pentagon, people are wondering just what these earlier &quot;reforms&quot; really accomplished.    The first consisted of 32 objectives such as pricing weapons more realistically, buying them competitively and in bigger quantities for greater savings, and dumping those that seemed marginal. These called-for improvements, issued in 1981, were named the &quot;Carlucci initiatives,&quot; after the then-deputy defense secretary who put them together.    When it appeared that the initiative didn't eliminate procurement problems like overpriced coffeepots and ashtrays, the White House set up a commission headed by David Packard, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. Mr. Carlucci was one of its more prominent members. Now even Mr. Packard is questioning how much the work of that commission has changed the Pentagon's weapons-buying machinery.    The latest scandal has spawned criticism of both efforts, and of Mr. Carlucci. &quot;It appears that neither the Carlucci initiatives nor the Packard Commission has corrected the underlying problem,&quot; says James Morrison, vice president of Business Executives for National Security, a privately funded defense watchdog group.    Some accounts from inside the Defense Department suggest that the Carlucci initiatives were designed to create the impression of change without necessarily changing anything. &quot;Frank ordered us to declare victory,&quot; says a Pentagon official who left. &quot;The services knew he didn't stand behind&quot; his initiatives.    Mr. Carlucci left it to the services to grade themselves on how well they had carried out the changes. A report to Mr. Carlucci from the services contains universally high marks but no explanations to back them up.    Concludes David Smith, a defense consultant: &quot;It's not clear to me that any of those things made an impact.&quot;    Neither the &quot;Carlucci initiatives&quot; nor the report issued later by the Packard Commission contained anything about defense consultants and their capacity to bend the procurement process to the gain of one or another supplier. Nor did they address the problem that a more competitive defense-procurement system might spawn a market in inside information.    In his previous stint at the Defense Department as deputy secretary, notes a Rand Corp. analyst, Mr. Carlucci &quot;was the chief operating officer of the Pentagon.&quot; As such, he had more direct responsibility for the procurement system than Mr. Weinberger, who is often blamed for the weapons-buying embarrassments that occurred.    After first insisting that the scandal involved dishonest individuals, not the procurement system, Mr. Carlucci is conceding that some further improvements may be in order, though he believes that it's too early to say what they should be. Meanwhile, he has set up a new Defense Department task force and asked for continuing advice from two old Pentagon hands -- Mr. Packard and Donald Rumsfeld, a former defense secretary.    &quot;Should further changes be necessary as a result of the investigation, I will be the first to propose them,&quot; Mr. Carlucci said in a speech Monday.    But critics say the procurement system hasn't suffered so much from a lack of proposals as from a lack of commitment to follow through on them. &quot;Just because the secretary gives an order doesn't mean that it is going to happen,&quot; says James Wolbarsht, who worked in the Pentagon in the early 1980s and later at the White House. &quot;He needs a strong staff to send a repetitive message over a long period of time to get his themes across to hundreds of thousands of people involved in the weaponsbuying process.&quot;    According to a General Accounting Office report, the Pentagon hasn't had anyone in charge of pushing through the Carlucci initiatives for the past five years.    The Pentagon hasn't received high marks for carrying out the recommendations of the Packard Commission either. Last year, Mr. Packard himself said that while commission members were &quot;impressed with the organizational and procedural steps taken. . . we cannot say the same for implementation of the acquisition policy changes we recommend.&quot;    Following a Packard Commission recommendation, the department did set up a new undersecretary for acquisition, but the first holder of the post, Richard Godwin, quit in frustration last year. He said the services and some civilian officials in the Office of the Defense Secretary relegated him to figurehead status.    Since returning to the Pentagon last year, Mr. Carlucci has pushed through some of the reforms he called for five years earlier. But the changes came as a function of the budget crunch. In the course of chopping $33 billion out of the fiscal 1989 budget plan left by Mr. Weinberger, he dropped a slew of weapons that seemed marginal. According to Michael Rich, who manages defense projects for Rand Corp., that gets to a problem none of the reforms has touched -- planning more projects than the budget would support. &quot;There aren't enough dollars to go around for multiple new starts,&quot; he says.    Still, the toughest reform task is already showing itself in the outlines of the procurement scandal being investigated: how to manage the conflicts of interest that arise from a procurement system that contains elements of a competitive marketplace alongside elements of an old-boy network in which the government and its contractors map out future weapons-buying plans together.    In the end, senior Pentagon officials say, they need both competition among arms companies to contain prices and heavy collaboration with the industry to keep in touch with new technological breakthroughs and realistic ideas of what can be produced. The problem of keeping such a system free of abuses will very likely be the job of a future reform commission. </TEXT></DOC>
