TECHNOLOGY @ 2ND QTR. 1989 2ND QTR. 1988 % CHG. @ 4,447,232 5,011,742 - 11    Semiconductor makers face flat growth. Aggressive price-cutting in commodity chips has sliced profit margins at such companies as Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductor, which depend heavily on such standardized chips. Analysts say a flat third quarter won't affect Intel as much because desktop-computer makers still present strong demand for that company's fastest microprocessors used in high-end models. National Semiconductor's sale of a unit for a $174.9 million after-tax gain offset a $53.2 million operating loss caused by inventory write-offs and charges to cover the cost of planned plant closings.    Slower growth has hit software vendors. But varying strength in different markets has created winners and losers. Novell sees good prospects from the strong demand for connecting computers over networks; Computer Associates has overcome flat growth in the mainframe-computing market by acquiring other software vendors; in the personal-computer market, companies such as Microsoft that have a broad product range are seeing healthy earnings.    For ATandamp;T, Chairman Robert Allen said, &quot;It was an excellent quarter all around.&quot; Operating profit grew 25%, reflecting cost controls, and the operating-profit margin fattened to 13% from 11% a year earlier. Mary McCaffrey at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell sees &quot;continued steady progress from {ATandamp;T's} core businesses.&quot; Joel Gross, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, sees ATandamp;T &quot;making progress&quot; and &quot;doing a lot of the right things.&quot; But he is concerned that if the economy enters a recession, the company could &quot;have some problems.&quot; At General Instrument, results were &quot;on plan.&quot; Sales of coaxial cable continued strong, and the company turned the red ink to black at the wagering operations, which make equipment for race tracks, lotteries and the like. @ DATA PROCESSING @ -- COMPUTERS/INFORMATION @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 15 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Amdahl Corp 32,807 52,754 - 38 @ Apple Computer 96,129 91,311 + 5 @ Compaq Computer 83,940 58,621 + 43 @ Control Data -497,300 9,200 ... @ Cray Research 4,414 19,100 - 77 @ Data General -23,100 600 ... @ Digital Equipment 313,215 401,013 - 22 @ Int'l Business M 1,340,000 964,000 + 39 @ NCR 110,404 112,439 - 2 @ Prime Computer -18,956 7,222 ... @ Seagate Technology 24,016 16,519 + 45 @ Tandem Computers 30,759 17,286 + 78 @ Unisys Corp 53,600 162,300 - 67 @ Wang Labs -374,700 13,400 ... @ Zenith Electronics -13,000 -12,100 ... @ TOTAL 1,162,228 1,913,665 - 39 @ -- OFFICE EQUIPMENT @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ AM International 8,117 1,551 + 423 @ Nashua Corp 4,693 9,050 - 48 @ Pitney Bowes 61,769 56,505 + 9 @ Xerox Corp 179,000 167,000 + 7 @ TOTAL 253,579 234,106 + 8 @ -- SEMICONDUCTOR @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 5 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Advanced Micro 12,073 26,088 - 54 @ Analog Devices 10,169 9,513 + 7 @ Applied Materials 13,919 8,745 + 59 @ Intel Corp 99,319 130,730 - 24 @ Nat'l Semiconductor 77,100 22,400 + 244 @ TOTAL 212,580 197,476 + 8 @ -- SOFTWARE/PROCESSING @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 7 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Autodesk Inc 10,800 7,246 + 49 @ Computer Assoc 26,740 16,921 + 58 @ Computer Sciences 13,116 11,692 + 12 @ Lotus Development 10,272 17,306 - 41 @ Microsoft Corp 45,352 30,012 + 51 @ Novell Inc 11,235 8,547 + 31 @ Oracle Systems Corp 33,546 19,083 + 76 @ TOTAL 151,061 110,807 + 36 @ OTHERS @ -- COMMUNICATIONS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ American Tel andamp; Tel 699,000 594,000 + 18 @ Communic Satellite 18,300 17,600 + 4 @ General Instrument 32,456 21,364 + 52 @ Motorola Inc 154,000 120,000 + 28 @ TOTAL 903,756 752,964 + 20 @ -- AEROSPACE/DEFENSE @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 13 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Boeing Co 195,000 160,000 + 22 @ E-Systems Inc 19,426 19,216 + 1 @ Gencorp Inc 17,000 21,000 - 19 @ General Dynamics 58,400 46,700 + 25 @ Grumman Corp 19,538 18,766 + 4 @ Lockheed Corp 77,000 106,000 - 27 @ Loral Corp 17,267 19,628 - 12 @ Martin Marietta 86,921 81,425 + 7 @ McDonnell Douglas -48,000 71,000 ... @ Northrop Corp -78,100 21,900 ... @ Precision Castparts 7,700 6,800 + 13 @ Sundstrand Corp 37,889 -47,074 ... @ Thiokol Corp 10,733 11,536 - 7 @ TOTAL 420,774 536,897 - 22 @ -- DIVERSIFIED TECH @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 12 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Corning Inc 69,400 82,000 - 15 @ EGandamp;G Inc 17,459 18,989 - 8 @ Honeywell Inc 74,800 31,600 + 137 @ Litton Indust 44,662 42,038 + 6 @ Minnesota Mng andamp; M 327,000 309,000 + 6 @ Raytheon 133,700 122,300 + 9 @ Rockwell Int'l 178,100 214,700 - 17 @ Tektronix Inc -2,126 -17,070 ... @ Texas Instruments 106,100 91,800 + 16 @ TRW Inc 70,000 71,000 - 1 @ United Technolog 197,300 196,200 + 1 @ Varian Associates 9,100 11,800 - 23 @ TOTAL 1,225,495 1,174,357 + 4 @ -- INDUSTRIAL TECH @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 5 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Ametek Inc 10,898 4,130 + 164 @ General Signal 18,668 -10,801 ... @ Intergraph Corp 20,447 23,424 - 13 @ Millipore Corp 13,466 13,131 + 3 @ Pall Corp 13,773 18,974 - 27 @ TOTAL 77,252 48,858 + 58 @ -- MEDICAL/BIO TECH @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 4 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Amgen Inc 835 305 + 174 @ Genentech Inc 9,596 15,474 - 38 @ Medtronic Inc 25,476 23,003 + 11 @ Stryker Corp 4,600 3,830 + 20 @ TOTAL 40,507 42,612 - 5    ---   FINANCIAL SERVICES @ 2ND QTR. 1989 2ND QTR. 1988 % CHG. @ 8,187,696 6,753,598 + 21    Bank earnings generally were somewhat disappointing. Rising interest rates during the second quarter put pressure on net interest margins. Nonperforming loans continued to rise at many banks as commercial real estate markets continued downward. Money-center banks also charged off 20% of the loan exposure to Argentina. Manufacturers Hanover's comparison with the prior year's earnings was distorted by a gain last year on the sale of a finance subsidiary. Chemical Banking and Bankers Trust both posted record or near-record foreign exchange trading results.    Life-insurance sales bounced back, but the price wars in the commercial property/casualty segment of the industry continued to depress premium revenues and income. Last year's hefty price increases for group health insurance allowed many companies to catch up with soaring medical costs and contributed to improved results this year. Aetna's group-health-insurance earnings more than doubled in the second quarter. But it had losses of $17 million in its auto and homeowners business because of continued high auto-insurance claims and windstorm losses. Provident Life andamp; Accident's employee-benefits segment posted a profit, vs. a year-earlier loss. American General's results were aided by an $86 million after-tax gain from the sale of its property/casualty insurance segment. A $1.5 billion after-tax investment loss depressed Ohio Casualty's net.    The savings-and-loan industry continues to squirm on the interest-rate spike. The difference between the short-term rates at which thrifts acquire funds and the long-term rates they receive on loans is practically nonexistent, shrinking thrifts' margins and making it harder to resell loans. The less healthy the thrift, the more striking the impact: CalFed saw its net interest spread droop to 1.78% from a year-earlier 2.58%. Its profit halved. GlenFed saw its provision for loan losses increase 145% and suffered a 43% earnings dive. Meanwhile, Golden West Financial, one of the nation's stronger thrifts, offset rate problems by lending into the furious West Coast real-estate market, boosting loan volume 10% and profit 11%. But even H.F. Ahmanson, another industry heavyweight that had used loan volume in recent quarters to counter rate pressure, suffered a 19% earnings decline, as loan originations dropped 27% and gains on loan sales dropped 92%.    Securities brokers, the first quarter's worst-performing industry group, staged an unexpected turnaround. They were aided by a modest rise in stock-and-bond trading activity. Salomon's quarter was its best ever. A $38 million jump in brokerage commissions, to $174 million, more than made up for a slippage in investment banking to give PaineWebber its sharply higher results. Morgan Stanley, while falling, still had its second-best quarter ever. And although A.G. Edwards's fiscal quarter didn't include June's busier trading, profit soared 314% because of year-earlier litigation expenses. @ BANKS @ -- MONEY-CENTER BANKS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 8 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Bankamerica 304,000 162,000 + 88 @ Bankers Trust NY 174,600 174,100 0 @ Chase Manhattan 136,681 224,134 - 39 @ Chemical Banking 128,600 127,700 + 1 @ Citicorp 395,000 359,000 + 10 @ First Chicago 134,400 122,900 + 9 @ Manufacturers H 106,000 403,000 - 74 @ Morgan (J P) Co 206,300 228,700 - 10 @ TOTAL 1,585,581 1,801,534 - 12 @ -- CENTRAL-STATES BANKS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 15 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Ameritrust Corp 30,400 25,200 + 21 @ Banc One Corp 91,327 83,636 + 9 @ Boatmen's Bancsh 33,028 23,740 + 39 @ Comerica Inc 30,281 27,775 + 9 @ Fifth Third Banc 24,809 21,438 + 16 @ First Bank System 53,000 36,500 + 45 @ Huntington Bancsh 24,054 21,339 + 13 @ Manufacturers N 26,828 23,609 + 14 @ Michigan Nat'l 23,042 24,108 - 4 @ National City Corp 65,800 53,800 + 22 @ NBD Bancorp 66,032 55,204 + 20 @ Northern Trust 28,900 22,000 + 31 @ Norwest Corp 58,800 51,300 + 15 @ Society Corp 28,688 24,728 + 16 @ Star Banc Corp 14,051 13,313 + 6 @ TOTAL 599,040 507,690 + 18 @ -- EASTERN BANKS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 17 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Bank of Boston 97,800 76,100 + 29 @ Bank of New Eng 36,500 69,200 - 47 @ Bank of New York 114,344 49,707 + 130 @ BayBanks Inc 18,863 21,960 - 14 @ CoreStates Fin'l 49,592 43,566 + 14 @ First Fidelity 63,229 70,182 - 10 @ Fleet/Norstar Fn 90,153 82,885 + 9 @ Keycorp 33,420 26,023 + 28 @ Mellon Bank Corp 64,000 28,000 + 129 @ Meridian Bancorp 21,907 21,348 + 3 @ Midlantic Corp 61,557 53,744 + 15 @ MNC Financial Inc 50,476 43,010 + 17 @ PNC Financial Corp 125,469 113,697 + 10 @ Republic New York 43,800 43,300 + 1 @ Shawmut Nat'l 66,769 58,850 + 13 @ State Street Boston 24,934 22,753 + 10 @ UJB Financial Corp 30,847 28,567 + 8 @ TOTAL 993,660 852,892 + 17 @ -- SOUTHERN BANKS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 12 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Amsouth Bancorp 21,131 20,410 + 4 @ Barnett Banks Inc 64,300 56,400 + 14 @ Citizens andamp;

Profits slipped at some because of year-ago gains and higher interest expenses. However, overall usage continued to grow. MCI saw profit more than double from its long-distance services; the company also displayed strong operating-margin growth. United Telecom had gains in all its communications businesses, but benefited primarily from &quot;strengthening fundamentals and profitability&quot; at US Sprint.    Electric utilities generally posted moderate second-quarter gains thanks to continued economic growth, which fueled commercial and industrial power sales. Although the weather wasn't as hot this year as a year earlier, the millions of air conditioners that were purchased last summer helped utilities avoid a weather-related downturn this year. This year's results also look good compared with last year because the industry wasn't hit with a round of rate cuts ordered by state-utility regulators, something that had plagued power companies during the previous couple of years. @ -- TELEPHONE @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 16 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Alltel Corp 37,626 39,302 - 4 @ Ameritech 316,600 351,500 - 10 @ Bell Atlantic Corp 360,800 344,100 + 5 @ BellSouth Corp 418,100 395,700 + 6 @ Centel Corp 7,983 29,967 - 73 @ Cincinnati Bell 24,011 23,357 + 3 @ Contel Corp 67,000 105,000 - 36 @ GTE Corp 328,764 299,449 + 10 @ MCI Communicat 150,000 62,000 + 142 @ Metro Mobile CTS -11,002 -10,916 ... @ NYNEX Corp 279,000 322,800 - 14 @ Pacific Telesis Grp 325,000 321,000 + 1 @ Southern N E Tel 63,900 39,300 + 63 @ Southwestern Bell 261,500 212,900 + 23 @ U S West Inc 258,600 336,300 - 23 @ United Telecom 90,500 41,000 + 121 @ TOTAL 2,978,382 2,912,759 + 2 @ -- ELECTRIC @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 59 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Allegheny Power 42,541 37,719 + 13 @ American Elec Pwr 129,288 118,785 + 9 @ Atlantic Energy 16,200 11,100 + 46 @ Baltimore G andamp; E 43,952 43,335 + 1 @ Carolina Pwr andamp; Lt 72,645 63,917 + 14 @ Centerior Energy 77,807 57,565 + 35 @ Central andamp; So West 70,000 80,000 - 13 @ Central Ill P S 19,762 17,867 + 11 @ Cincinnati G andamp; E 46,979 46,359 + 1 @ CMS Energy 63,261 52,644 + 20 @ Commonwealth Ed 152,613 97,134 + 57 @ Consolidated Ed 65,650 83,979 - 22 @ Delmarva P andamp; L 14,257 14,964 - 5 @ Detroit Edison 96,133 73,445 + 31 @ Dominion Resource 51,500 71,400 - 28 @ DPL Inc 29,176 32,906 - 11 @ Duke Power 127,270 95,777 + 33 @ Duquesne Light 23,975 24,434 - 2 @ Florida Progress 45,300 41,600 + 9 @ FPL Group Inc 111,077 95,455 + 16 @ General Public Ut 53,419 55,676 - 4 @ Gulf States Utilities 3,137 30,082 - 90 @ Idaho Power Co 20,169 5,805 + 247 @ Illinois Power -1,238 25,363 ... @ Ipalco Enterp 16,803 21,577 - 22 @ Kansas City P andamp; L 21,617 31,827 - 32 @ Kansas Gas andamp; El 16,421 12,363 + 33 @ Kentucky Util 14,593 14,989 - 3 @ Long Island Ltg -215,314 63,739 ... @ Louisville G andamp; E 18,027 16,483 + 9 @ Montana Power Co 7,700 6,101 + 26 @ New England El Sy 21,961 -158,498 ... @ New York St E andamp; G 39,652 48,078 - 18 @ Niagara Mohawk Pwr 34,147 46,823 - 27 @ NIPSCO Indust 17,801 13,543 + 31 @ Northeast Utilities 37,007 42,834 - 14 @ Northern States Pwr 36,900 44,000 - 16 @ Ohio Edison 82,669 72,094 + 15 @ Oklahoma Gas andamp; El 26,956 30,740 - 12 @ PacifiCorp 98,700 89,800 + 10 @ Pennsylvania P andamp; L 64,720 68,421 - 5 @ Philadelphia Elec 108,945 110,064 - 1 @ Pinnacle West Cap -11,283 43,579 ... @ Portland General 327 4,828 - 93 @ Potomac Electric 38,836 39,530 - 2 @ PSI Holdings Inc 36,576 30,191 + 21 @ Public Service Colo 39,478 29,434 + 34 @ Public Service Ent 113,662 107,296 + 6 @ Puget Sound P andamp; L 25,571 24,347 + 5 @ San Diego G andamp; E 43,234 39,857 + 8 @ SCANA Corp 21,004 17,371 + 21 @ SCECorp 141,004 146,533 - 4 @ Southern Co 187,419 162,004 + 16 @ Southwestern P S 29,508 21,111 + 40 @ TECO Energy 34,900 31,700 + 10 @ Tucson Elec Power 20,929 29,867 - 30 @ Union Electric 65,571 74,798 - 12 @ Washington Water 16,732 15,628 + 7 @ Wisconsin Energy 35,422 41,997 - 16 @ TOTAL 2,663,068 2,712,360 - 2 @ -- GAS @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 7 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ Consolidated N G 10,482 13,851 - 24 @ Equitable Resourc 4,470 3,149 + 42 @ Nicor Inc 15,200 11,500 + 32 @ Oneok Inc 8,411 6,551 + 28 @ Pacific Enterprise 53,000 48,000 + 10 @ Peoples Energy 11,517 9,940 + 16 @ Questar Corp 4,708 5,750 - 18 @ TOTAL 107,788 98,741 + 9 @ -- WATER @ 2nd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. % @ 5 Firms 1989 1988 Chg @ American Water Wks 15,941 14,517 + 10 @ California Water 3,935 3,892 + 1 @ Consumers Water 1,992 2,420 - 18 @ Hydraulic Co 1,690 2,180 - 22 @ United Water Res 3,291 4,867 - 32 @ TOTAL 26,849 27,876 - 4    ---@ CONGLOMERATES @ 2ND QTR. 1989 2ND QTR. 1988 % CHG. @ 1,423,348 1,285,725 + 11    GE continued to ring up the profits, and its 12.1% operating-profit margin in the second period was the highest for any quarter in its history.
