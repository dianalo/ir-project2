The report, issued by the ABA's National Executive Forum on theImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, said it is imperativeto find ways to reach eligible aliens, inform them and encouragethem to participate before the program ends.   The legalization program was developed to provide amnesty to anestimated 2 million undocumented workers. It is open to thosealiens who lived illegally in the United States before Jan.1, 1982,and to agricultural workers who can show they lived in this countryfor at least 90 days in the year ended May 1, 1986.   The ABA report, the result of a two-day conference funded by theGannett Foundation, also recommended that the INS allow applicantsto file a ``short form'' legalization application and adjust itsinterpretation of regulations to make the program available to themaximum number of aliens.   For those 1.3 million aliens who have already applied, thereport stressed the need for letting them know what to do to obtainpermanent status.   The statute requires that after an 18-month period, theapplicant must demonstrate a ``minimal understanding of ordinaryEnglish and a knowledge of U.S. history and government'' or makesatisfactory progress in courses of study to that end. Failure todo so would result in loss of permanent status.</TEXT></DOC>
