Over the weekend, the Los Angeles Times reported that the aircraft -- commercial 747, 737, and 757 jetliners and military AWACS radar-surveillance planes, all manufactured since July 1, 1986 -- may contain more than 2,000 possibly bogus bearings used in vital equipment, including gearboxes and pilot-control systems.    The newspaper quoted an engineer as saying in Los Angeles federal court documents unsealed at its request that he found several flaws in the bearings. The imperfections could cause the bearings to malfunction and would &quot;pose serious hazards&quot; if they were used in aircraft control systems, said the engineer, whose assessment was part of a suit filed by a company alleging its bearings were counterfeited by another.    A spokesman for Boeing said yesterday that the aerospace concern hasn't yet determined how many planes may contain the alleged counterfeit bearings or to whom they were sold. &quot;The ones we've identified so far as having been put in airplanes don't appear to have been put in flight-critical areas,&quot; he added.    The bearings alleged to be counterfeit were produced and sold to Boeing by Alliance Bearing Industries, a closely held Van Nuys, Calif., ball-bearings supplier. The first public disclosure of the possibly bogus bearings was in a lawsuit filed July 28 against Alliance by Torrington Co., a Torrington, Conn., bearing-manufacturing unit of Ingersoll Rand Co. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.    In the suit Torrington contended that Alliance sold to Boeing more than 10,000 &quot;inferior, counterfeit&quot; ball bearings carrying a Torrington brand name, the newspaper reported. Torrington charged Alliance with trademark counterfeiting and infringement, unfair competition and racketeering.    Alliance President Morton Heller was also named a defendant, along with the company's sales manager and two of its officers. An attorney for all of the defendants said the alleged counterfeit bearings were mislabeled and shipped to Boeing by a former salesman for Alliance who was fired for misconduct last year. </TEXT></DOC>
