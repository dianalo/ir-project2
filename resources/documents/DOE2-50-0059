However, the history of Phanerozoic infaunal behaviorhas been the subject of controversy in recent years. Workers differ asto whether the depth and extent of bioturbation has been similar throughoutthe Phanerozoic or whether early Paleozoic bioturbation was much reducedin comparison with that of later times. In order to aid in resolutionof this controversy, ichnofabric was examined from inner shelf carbonatesof early to late Cambrian age in the Poleta, Bonanza King and Nopah Formationsin the Great Basin sequence of California, Nevada and Utah. Sedimentaryfabric was ranked as follows: O-no bioturbation, 1-discrete isolatedtraces, up to 10% of original bedding disturbed, 2-approximately 10 to40% of original bedding disturbed, 3-last vestiges of bedding discernible,approximately 40 to 60% disturbed, 4-bedding completely disturbed butnot mixed, 5-bedding nearly or totally homogenized. Data reveal relativelyextensive bioturbation as early as the Atabanian. The most commonly representedsedimentary fabrics are types 2, 3 and 4. Depth of bioturbation was notobserved to exceed 10 cm in any section and shows no significant trendthrough the Cambrian. Although these observations apply only to GreatBasin strata, this method can be used to compare ichnofabric in otherCambrian strata and indeed, strata throughout the Phanerozoic to furtherdetermine patterns of development of the infaunal biological benthicboundary layer.</TEXT></DOC>
