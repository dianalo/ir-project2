Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., has his way,the Agriculture Department will either send its proposal tostreamline meat inspection back to the drawing board or seeCongress do it through legislation.   ``If producers of food have learned anything from the Alar andother scares the last two months, (it is that) this is not the timeto do anything to give the suggestion of less safety in food,''Leahy said Thursday.   Putting off final decisions on the plans is not enough, he said.The department should ``just withdraw them'' and start over.   Leahy commented a day after consumer and labor organizationscharged that a streamlined inspection system proposed by thedepartment for cattle carcasses at packing houses could result inmore contamination of the beef supply.   Under the proposal, federal inspectors at 40 to 50 of thelargest slaughter plants, accounting for about 80 percent of thenation's beef, would rely more on company workers to keep hair,mud, excreta and other contaminants from the beef supply.   One result would be to speed up the lines of carcasses movingalong the inspection route, leaving inspectors less time to checkfor abcesses, tumors and other abnormalities.   Leahy said the nation's food supply is now safe, but that if theUSDA ``takes this step, I'm not sure we can guarantee it.''   The chairman said in a telephone interview that, in his 15 yearsin the Senate, he had never seen a time when ``people are moreconcerned about food safety than they are now. For decentinspection of all types, people are willing to pay the tiny amountextra that it costs.''   Leahy said he has been pressing the USDA for more than two yearsto make changes in its meat and poultry inspection system and tomodify some of the proposals it has under consideration.   If changes aren't made by the department, he said, ``Congress isgoing to do it legislatively'' when it writes the 1990 farm bill.   Department officials say they won't decide whether to proceedwith the proposed inspection revisions until they review publiccomments submitted after the proposal was made Dec. 1.   The meatpacking industry, led by the American Meat Institute,wants the plan reviewed by a scientific panel before it is finallyapproved to ensure that meat safety would not be diminished.   A separate but equally controversial department proposalannounced last November would reduce the number of federalinspectors at plants that turn out chicken soup, hot dogs and otherprocessed meat and poultry items.   One goal of this ``risk-based'' system would be to use computersand other technology to replace some of the day-by-day surveillanceby federal inspectors in processing plants with good records.   The proposed program would ease up on ``good'' plants and allowa certain degree of self-policing. But those with poor inspectionrecords would be subject to closer supervision.   Leahy said both proposals ``ought to be withdrawn and sent backtotally to the drawing boards,'' although he added that someaspects of each may make a lot of sense and perhaps should bereconsidered.   Have the Agriculture Department and Secretary Clayton Yeuttergotten Leahy's message?   ``I hope they have,'' he said. ``Because, administratively, thedepartment could take all the steps necessary to assure safety andquality. If they are unwilling to do it administratively, then Ican guarantee the Congress is going to do it legislatively.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A report by the Agriculture Department saysthe value of U.S. agricultural exports to the Soviet Union mayclimb to a record level this calendar year.   Substantially larger corn sales and much higher wheat prices areexpected to push the U.S. farm export value to the Soviet Union``well above'' last year's $2.25 billion, the department's EconomicResearch Service said Thursday in its preliminary report.   Exports in 1988 were nearly 2{ times the value of shipments in1987 and were exceeded only in 1979 and 1984, the report said.Furthermore, the United States this year may expand its share ofSoviet grain imports from about 30 percent in 1987 and 45 percentin 1988.   ``Last year, the USSR took 12 percent of the value of all U.S.grain and feed exports, and the U.S. share of all Sovietagricultural imports was an estimated 14 percent,'' the report said.   Analysts said Soviet agricultural imports from all foreignsources in 1989 may climb 10 percent above last year's level,estimated at $16.5 billion.   ``Grain probably will replace sugar as the leading Sovietagricultural import in 1989,'' the report said.   Soviet planners ``remain committed to a high degree ofself-sufficiency in food,'' and their policies primarily emphasize``increasing supplies rather than controlling demand,'' it said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jo Ann Smith, a Micanopy, Fla., rancher, hasbeen sworn in as the Agriculture Department's assistant secretaryfor marketing and inspection services.
