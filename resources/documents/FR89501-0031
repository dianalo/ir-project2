It provides that, in granting an extension, NHTSA ``shallensure that the State is making reasonable efforts to achieve compliance.''To implement the Truth in Mileage Act and to make some needed changes inthe Federal odometer laws, the agency published final rules which providethat a State may file a petition for an extension of time. The petitionshould discuss the efforts the State has taken to meet the deadline, thereasons why it needs additional time, the length of time desired for extension,and a description of the steps to be taken while the extension is in effect.53 FR 29464 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">Oregon's Petition</ITAG>The Oregon Department of Transportation, Motor Vehicles Division (Oregon)submitted a petition for an extension of time. In support of its petition,Oregon states that, currently, titles are not transferred without an odometerreading and certification. Furthermore, Oregon issues titles that indicatethe odometer reading and a brand. However, Oregon recognizes that its practicesand forms do not meet the new Federal regulatory requirements. Oregon statesthat it will seek amendments to existing State law. These amendments willinclude the exemption for transferors of vehicles ten years old and olderas permitted by Federal law, since current law requires odometer readingson titles and registration renewals only for vehicles less than eight modelyears old. Oregon anticipates that these amendments will be submitted tothe 1991 Legislature. In addition, Oregon explains that Oregon must reviseand reprint several title documents. Changes to the title require legislativeamendment. Oregon states that the legislative proposal to amend the titlewas proposed to the 1989 Legislature and that the State plans to reprintthe titles after the legislation passes and after the current supply oftitles are exhausted in early 1990. Oregon states that it will also replaceother forms at that time. For these reasons, Oregon requests that it begranted an extension of time until October 1, 1991.<ITAG tagnum="84">NHTSA's Response to the Petition</ITAG>NHTSA finds that Oregon has made reasonable efforts to achieve compliancewith the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act and the implementingregulations.Since the enactment of the Truth in Mileage Act, Oregon has examined itstitle document and reassignment forms. Oregon has determined that thesedocuments must be amended and that the reassignment forms must be set forthby a secure process, as required by the Truth in Mileage Act and NHTSA'simplementing regulation. In order to institute these changes, Oregon hasdrafted and proposed legislation that would amend existing State law. Inaddition, Oregon intends to propose would require odometer readings ontitles for vehicles up to ten years old, as required by the Federal regulations.Current Oregon law does not require an odometer reading for vehicles eightyears old or older. This legislation would be submitted to the 1991 Legislatureand Oregon expects favorable action that would result in October 1991 implementation.In light of Oregon's past and planned actions, and in order to allow Oregonto expend its current supply of titles documents, we grant Oregon's requestfor an extension of time until October 1, 1991, to revise its laws andits title documents to meet the Federal criteria.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>15 U.S.C. 1988 note; delegation of authority at 49CFR 1.50(f) and 501.8(e).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on April 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kathleen DeMeter,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Chief Council for General Law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-10355 Filed 4-26-89; 2:15 pm]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-59-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
