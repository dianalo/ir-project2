VENEZIA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal government is dusting offits plans for offshore gas and oil exploration, much to the dismayof environmentalists who are gearing up for another standoff alongthe Atlantic.   Ocean pollution incidents in the past two years have created ahypersensitive environment for officials in the Department ofInterior, which hopes to renew drilling activity in the next severalyears on the East Coast.   ``The ecosystem is certainly as stressed as it can possibly bewithout being in serious jeopardy from offshore drilling,'' saidCindy Zipf, coordinator of Clean Ocean Action, a coalition of morethan 100 environmental groups based in Sandy Hook, N.J.   Beth A. Millemann, director of Coast Alliance, a Washington-basednational coalition of environmental activists, reacted in likefashion.   ``My heavens, what do we have left to wash up?'' she said.``About the only thing we don't have washing up yet is oil. Perhapsthey want to make it a full banquet of human waste.''   Last year, the Interior Department published an inquiry in theFederal Register to assess industry interest in again leasing andexploring the offshore area. The proposed mid-Atlantic sale areaextends from Rhode Island south to North Carolina, covering morethan 71 million acres.   It is not the first attempt to explore the region. Between 1976and 1983, 32 exploratory wells were drilled in the mid-Atlanticregion. Only five produced hydrocarbons, indicating oil or gas, butnone in sufficient amounts to make it worth the investment inbringing it ashore.   Still, several oil companies have expressed an interest in moreexploration. The Interior Department is working on an environmentalimpact statement, due to be completed early next year, said MarciaHeimberger, a spokeswoman for the department. The eventual stepwould be to lease tracts again so interested companies could drillmore exploratory wells, she said.   In the meantime, concerned citizens should ``make sure _ rightnow _ that their governor and congressional representatives take avery firm stand against this, because the only thing the InteriorDepartment responds to is political pressure,'' said Sarah Chasis, asenior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in NewYork.   Already, several lawmakers have opposed the leasing plan.   When U.S. Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., found out about therenewed lease program last year, he immediately called forrevisions. He said the new five-year program is too heavily weightedtoward drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, and does notprovide sufficient protections for marine and coastal resources.   This month, Rep. James Courter, R-N.J., said he would askCongress to place a 10-year moratorium on oil and gas explorationoff the New Jersey shore.   In the first attempt to drill for oil off the mid-Atlanticstates, consortiums that included giants such as Mobil, Shell, Sunand Tenneco capped their wells after spending billions of dollars onone too many dry holes. So why would the federal government _ andthe oil companies _ want to try to lease such tracts again?   ``The most important reason is national security,'' Ms.Heimberger said. ``We're all seeing stories about OPEC trying towithhold production. It's an energy security issue for us,particularly in the northern Atlantic states, one of the largestusers and importers of natural gas.''   In addition, ``Even though the fields weren't commerciallyproducable 10 years ago, there have been a lot of technologicalimprovements,'' she said. ``It has changed by leaps and bounds,actually. Companies are now able to work in much deeper water.''   That could be the difference this time, according to RutgersUniversity geology professor Warren Manspeizer.   ``The target area in 1976 was a different sequence of rocks. Theydidn't go down deep enough last time,'' he said.   The real gamblers in the venture will ultimately be those who payfor the right to explore again for oil and gas.   ``But that's the nature of the business,'' said Joseph A.Lastelic, spokesman for the Washington-based American PetroleumInstitute. ``If you quit because of a few dry holes, you may beleaving a treasure behind.''   Oil companies are also aware of the need to increase U.S.production, he said.   ``We're now importing 42 percent of what we use,'' Lastelic said.``Our production continues to go down and consumption goes up.''   Both the federal government and the oil companies realisticallyexpect opposition, however. Ms. Zipf and Ms. Millemann, forinstance, questioned why the United States is not working to findother energy sources, and why the federal government relaxedrestrictions on vehicles that burn a lot of gasoline.   ``There's much more we could be doing to conserve rather thanlooking for potential new sources,'' Ms. Zipf said.   She pointed to some of the potential dangers from offshoredrilling, including oil spills and dredge remains. Ms. Millemannsaid that recent ocean pollution incidents have proven that currentspull pollutants toward shore or into prime fishing grounds.   ``The Coast Guard estimates they collect 10 percent or less ofoil from a spill,'' she said.   Lastelic, in turn, explained that the last industry oil spilloccurred almost 20 years ago, ``and in that interim, we've madegreat technological progress in drilling, and we now have a wholeset of environmental laws and inspections.''   Although he acknowledged that drilling may sometimes stir up theocean bottom close to the platform, ``no one has been able toconclude that it drifts far away. ... No one has been able to showthese muds have done any damage to fish.''   In reality, the platforms usually attract schools of fish becausemicroscopic life clings to the bottom, Lastelic said.   Ms. Millemann vehemently disagreed that oil drilling hardlyaffects the waters.   ``The process of extracting oil from underwater creates hugequantities of pollutants,'' she said. ``Lubricating oils are neededto keep the bit going into the ground, and they usually use dieseloil, even though the Environmental Protection Agency has wanted themto use mineral oil.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday Dec. 26</NOTE></DOC>
