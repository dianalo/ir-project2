Baker III said Sunday before leaving for urgenttalks with allied leaders on the rapid changes sweeping theCommunist East.   ``If it happens too abruptly, you run a greater risk that itmight not happen peacefully,'' Baker said.   Speaking on the ABC-TV program ``This Week with DavidBrinkley,'' Baker also predicted an increasing emphasis on thepolitical aspect of the NATO alliance as its military might becomesless important in the new atmosphere. But he said there is nodanger that U.S. forces will pull out entirely.   Political uncertainty in East Germany ``tends a bit, could tend,toward instability,'' Baker said. ``We've made it clear all alongin this process that we do not seek to take unilateral advantage ofwhat's going on there at the expense of the Soviet Union, and wewant the process to continue to unfold in a stable way.''   In an interview on the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation,''Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze voiced his own concernsabout a reunified Germany. The security of postwar Europe has beenbuilt on the assumption of a divided Germany, he said, and thatstructure will not be changed easily.   ``Is it right, is it appropriate, that the Germans would like tohave a unified state? I think that's logical,'' he said through aninterpreter. ``But what would be the circumstances ... in what kindof Europe? Those are the kinds of questions that should beanswered.''   In the meantime, it is reasonable to expect ``a certainrapprochement'' between East and West Germany based on treaties andagreements, part of an overall process of political, legal andeconomic integration sweeping Europe that will lead eventually to adisbanding of military alliances.   ``This process should not be in any way interfered with,''Shevardnadze said. ``It should not be slowed down.''   During his trip, Baker plans to visit the Berlin Wall and tomake a foreign policy speech to the Berlin press club.   The six-day trip initially was scheduled as an uneventful wintermeeting with the foreign ministers of the 15 NATO countries inBrussels, the headquarters of the Western alliance.   But a sequence of political upheavals in East Germany andCzechoslovakia, following the sharp detour from orthodox communismin Poland and Hungary, caused Baker to consult with his Westernpartners in an atmosphere of uncertainty.   They will try to figure out whether Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev will continue to encourage change with unrest mounting inEast Germany and the abolition of the Communist party's monopoly ofpower in the Soviet republic of Lithuania.   Managing economic aid for Poland and Hungary and pondering thefuture of NATO as a military alliance as East-West tensions recedeare also on Baker's agenda in Brussels.   Baker said more U.S. aid likely will flow to other East Bloccountries as they establish democracies and political pluralism andadopt free-market economies.   Then there is the overriding issue of German reunification and asharp warning recently from Moscow that the plan set forth by WestGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl and praised by the State Departmentwas ``fraught with dangerous consequences.''   French President Francois Mitterrand also has cautioned WestGermany not to push for reunification with East Germany, saying itcould upset the delicate balance in Europe.   Other U.S. allies also are known to be nervous about theprospect of a reunited and mighty Germany even though they are notas outspoken as the French leader. Their concerns are partly rootedin the devastation of Europe at the hands of the Germans in WorldWar II.   Baker had planned to travel to Bonn to meet with Kohl, butinstead will meet with Kohl in Berlin Tuesday. Baker will joinPresident Bush in a meeting with Mitterrand in the Caribbean islandof St. Martin on Saturday.   They, of course, will want to know if reports that Baker thinksKohl moved too fast are accurate.   The Bush administration has deferred most decisions on Germanreunification to the West Europeans. But the allies would not wantto get out of step with the United States.   Baker begins his trip with a visit to London and meetings withBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Foreign SecretaryDouglas Hurd.   The stop was a last-minute addition, and is designed primarilyto straighten out a squabble with the closest U.S. ally.   At a NATO meeting last Monday with Mrs. Thatcher and otherallied leaders, Bush proposed an ``intensified effort'' toward thepolitical integration of Western Europe.   Mrs. Thatcher has had doubts even about the current pace.Baker's visit follows moves by Bush and Brent Scowcroft, the U.S.national security adviser, to placate the British leader and assureher the ``special relationship'' between Washington and London isintact.</TEXT></DOC>
