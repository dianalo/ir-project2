Bush's stuck to the text of his tough-on-crime speech beforeTexas supporters and made no mention of running mate Dan Quayle'sdebate Wednesday night with Democratic vice presidential candidateLloyd Bentsen.   But later, while jogging at a quarter-mile track with studentsat Texas Christian University, the vice president said he felt ``asgood as I did last night, which is very, very good.''   Bush said Quayle ``answered the questions, he was knowledgeable,he did an outstanding job and the American people know it, andnobody's going to be able to _ even our spin merchants or theDukakis spin merchants _ can't change the facts.''   Immediately after the nationally broadcast, 90-minute debate inOmaha, Neb., the GOP nominee congratulated Quayle for ``a superbjob.''   Speaking to a gathering of Texas law enforcement officialssponsored by the Dallas-Fort Worth Crime Commission, Bush said hewould seek $250 million annually for the next four years ``toincarcerate the hardened felons and rising number of drugoffenders.''   He also said he would use assets seized from drug traffickers tohelp finance new prison construction.   Expanding on a proposal that he unveiled Wednesday, Bush that aspresident he would create a unit within the Justice Department'scriminal division that would be devoted solely to mobilizinggovernment resources in a battle against violence-prone streetgangs.   Bush adviser Debrah Steelman said the proposal would cost about$50 million and would involve ``administrative efforts tocoordinate and fully utilize existing resources at the federal,state and local levels.''   Bush said he believes in rehabilitation to some extent,especially for first-time offenders.   ``But let's face it, some criminals are just plain bad. They'renot going to be rehabilitated. They're not going to reform,'' hesaid.   ``You're not going to solve the crime problem as some would bytalking tough while pursuing the same failed policies of liberalleniency,'' Bush said.   He accused Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis of having a``liberal sense'' that counters the ``common sense'' that the deathpenalty is a deterrent.   ``I say that our society simply cannot afford any more liberalexperimentation with crime,'' he said.   Bush called again for converting obsolete military bases intoprisons and for 100 new special agents to expand the government'srepeat-offender program for handling those who commit repeatedcrimes.   Bush said that white-collar criminals should not be givenspecial treatment. ``We should throw the book at them,'' he said.   After the Quayle-Bentsen debate, Bush summoned reporters andcamera crews to his hotel to say that his running mate ``camethrough with flying colors'' under tremendous pressure. ``Nowpeople can see what I've seen all along,'' he said.   ``This guy did a superb job,'' he added. ``I couldn't behappier.''   From Fort Worth, the vice president headed to Midland, Texas,and Little Rock, Ark.   Prior to the debate, the vice president invited reporters towatch the first question with him, and Bush declared his runningmate's response a ``home run.''   ``He's doing good, good opening, strong opening, right out ofthe ball park, the Canseco of American politics,'' Bush toldreporters, referring to Oakland A's baseball player Jose Canseco.``He hit it the first answer, home run.,''   Asked if the question to Quayle _ a Republican senator fromIndiana _ on criticisms of his qualifications was a fair one, Bushreplied: ``Everything's fair in this business. ... I'd like to geta slow ball like that in the first one. It's easy.''   Bush's chief of staff Craig Fuller said that while viewing thedebate in his hotel suite the GOP nominee cheered on Quayle withsuch comments as ``he's doing a fantastic job.''   After the debate, Bush called Quayle and told him it was ``a10-strike,'' Fuller said. Bush also called President Reagan toexpress his delight.   Bush then told reporters that the American people saw Quayle``in form, in control, answering substantive questions in asubstantive way and strong.''   Asked about Bentsen's performance, Bush said, ``I'm not going tocriticize the other guy.''   Earlier in the day, Bush unveiled a $3.9 billion ``Invest in OurChildren'' package that encompassed educational, health, anti-gangand anti-toxic proposals that Bush said would combine to improveeducational opportunity for children.   The 32-page plan included some previously announced Bushproposals, including a tax credit for child care, and a provisionaimed at the poor calling for Medicaid coverage for pregnant womenand infants at up to 185 percent of the poverty level.   Such individuals who do not have private sector insurance could```buy in'' to the Medicaid system at an amount that does notexceed 4 or 5 percent of their income, according to Bush adviserDeborah Steelman.</TEXT></DOC>
