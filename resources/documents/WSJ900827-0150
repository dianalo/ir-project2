An estimated $12 billion is invested in managed futuresfunds, which are pools of professionally managed capitalinvested in futures markets, compared with $500 million in1980, according to Managed Account Reports, Columbia, Md.,which tracks the performance of managed futures fundoperators. Investments in such funds are now actively soldthrough several major brokerage concerns.</LP><TEXT>   But such funds need far more oversight than they'recurrently getting, many regulators say. Just how long andineffective the regulatory leash is was brought to light bythe collapse of Stotler Funds Inc. this month amid regulatorycharges of fraud and misuse of customer funds.   A routine audit of Stotler Funds' financial statementsthree months ago by regulators revealed a questionabletransfer of about $5.5 million in customer money that formedthe basis for the fraud charges by regulators. But no actionwas taken against the funds unit until after itscash-strapped parent, Stotler Group Inc., defaulted oncommercial paper payments to one of the funds and otherlenders July 26. At that point Stotler Funds halted customerredemptions from the fund.   The default might have been prevented, and no customermoney would have been imperiled, if regulators had forcedStotler Funds to unwind the $5.5 million transfer when it wasdiscovered, futures industry officials said.   Stotler Funds hasn't said how much, if any, of the $5.5million is recoverable. Regulators declined to comment on thestatus of the funds.   In the wake of Stotler Funds' collapse, &quot;we need toexplore the need for additional regulations on intracompanytransactions,&quot; said Daniel Roth, general counsel of theNational Futures Association, the industry-funded regulatorthat audited the Stotler funds. The NFA audits financialstatements from all publicly offered managed futures funds.   Last Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission andthe Securities and Exchange Commission charged StotlerGroup's defunct brokerage unit, Stotler andamp; Co., inadministrative proceedings with, among other things, failingto maintain sufficient capital since December. Those actionsfollow CFTC charges July 31 that Stotler Funds violatedanti-fraud laws by effectively loaning $5.5 million toStotler Group from money that it told customers would beinvested in the futures markets.   This month, Stotler Group was forced into involuntarybankruptcy-law proceedings by certain of the funds from whichthe $5.5 million was borrowed. Further regulatory actionagainst the company and possibly its officers is expected.   The CFTC is the federal futures industry regulator. TheSEC had oversight responsibility for Stotler andamp; Co.'sgovernment securities activities.   Regulators and futures industry officials said it isimpossible to know how widespread such possibly fraudulentmishandling of customer money by futures fund mangers iswithout more regulatory scrutiny. &quot;Typically, you don't findout about these things until they explode,&quot; said MortonBaratz, editor of Managed Account Reports.   Lawrence Hite, a partner with Mint Investment Managementin New York, said Mint and most management companies maintaininternal auditing controls that are designed to preventfraudulent handling of customer funds. But these controls areonly as reliable as the management company's officials.   ELM Financial Inc. in Dallas was the trading adviser toone of the Stotler funds. ELM invested the fund's money inthe futures markets, but it didn't know of the commercialpaper purchase until the day of the default, according toELM's founder, Ed Miller. Mr. Miller said he never received acopy of the fund's audited financial report that noted thecommercial paper transaction. He said he resigned as adviserto Stotler's Compass Futures Fund 10 minutes after learningof the commercial paper transaction from Stotler Funds'president, Thomas Kolter.   Troubles engulfing the Stotler companies reached to thetop of the Chicago Board of Trade this month, when itschairman, Karsten &quot;Cash&quot; Mahlmann, suddenly resigned as theexchange's top elected official. Mr. Mahlmann also resignedas chairman of Stotler Group and its collapsed futuresbrokerage subsidiary, Stotler andamp; Co.   In a letter to CBOT members, Mr. Mahlmann said he didn'tknow about the problems at Stotler Funds. If he had, &quot;I wouldnot have condoned them, and I would have taken action toreverse them,&quot; he told the members. Mr. Mahlmann didn'treturn calls seeking comment.   In its complaint against Stotler Funds, the CFTC chargedthe unit with fraudulently misusing money from hundreds ofinvestors in two commodity funds -- Compass Futures Funds andAdvanced Portfolio Management L.P. The federal futuresindustry regulator charged that Stotler Funds late last yearfraudulently loaned $5.5 million from the two funds that wasearmarked for investment in the futures markets to StotlerGroup.   When the National Futures Association queried StotlerFunds about the loans in May, the association said the loans&quot;may be in violation of the pools' respective disclosuredocuments.&quot; The Compass funds disclosure document&quot;specifically disallows such lending,&quot; the association said.   Mr. Kolter, Stotler Funds' president, responded thefollowing week by telling the association that investors wereaware of the transactions. Investors in Compass Futures Fundhad been told of the loan to Stotler Group in a note in thefund's annual report, which was audited by accountantsCoopers andamp; Lybrand, Mr. Kolter said. The National FuturesAssociation received the audited report for 1989 in lateMarch of this year.   Mr. Kolter didn't return calls seeking comment.   A senior NFA official insisted that the regulator didn'tdrop its investigation of Stotler because of Mr. Kolter'sletter. &quot;But we did put it on the back burner&quot; because of theCoopers andamp; Lybrand imprimatur, he said. A Coopers andamp; Lybrandspokesman declined to comment on the audit of the Stotlerfunds.   After failing to secure an emergency cash infusion of $10million in late July, Stotler Group defaulted on $750,000 incommercial paper payments, $260,000 of which is owed CompassFutures Fund. Compass loaned a total of about $4.5 million toStotler Group via the purchase of its commercial paper.Advanced Portfolio Management loaned Stotler Group $1 millionin the form of a demand note.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Gold                                                                                                          The rally triggered by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwaitsparked a global wave of forward selling by producers thathas stifled price advances. But that selling may have peaked.   &quot;Before the crisis began, Australia, for example, hadalready sold about 60% of its production for two years aheadat an average price of 600 Australian dollars (then aboutUS$460) an ounce,&quot; says Don Mackay-Coghill, chief executiveofficer of Gold Corp. of Australia, a government-ownedconcern that sells Australia's legal-tender precious metalcoins. &quot;When you consider that it cost between A$300 andA$350 (an ounce) to mine the gold, producers were very happywith the profit.&quot;   Producers in the Soviet Union, South Africa and even theU.S. sold gold this way when the price rose above $400 anounce, Mr. Mackay-Coghill says. As a result, he says, goldprices have advanced about 20% during the recent rally andthe market has absorbed tremendous selling without breaking.   The conventional wisdom now holds that if there is adiplomatic settlement of the Mideast crisis, gold will dropsharply, perhaps to around $350, Mr. Mackay-Coghill says.However, &quot;I don't agree,&quot; he says. &quot;I think the decline willamount to $15 to $20 or to $25 at the most.&quot;   The sharp rise in oil prices that is just starting to workits way through world economies will have an inflationaryimpact that will create a strong underpinning for goldprices, he says.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Grain futures prices, inflated by concern about thenumerous ways higher petroleum prices will hurt farmers, maydrift downward this week if the Mideast crisis remainsstalemated, analysts said. The correction is not likely to besharp, however, because fundamentals in soybeans, corn andwheat remain strong.   Weather in the Mississippi valley growing region has beenhot and dry throughout August, and farmers in Brazil aresuffering from a host of financial problems. Demand,meanwhile, remains strong for soybeans and other grains.   Last week, &quot;a lot of people were talking about making war,and the markets reacted accordingly,&quot; said Daniel Basse,director of market research for Ag-Resource Co., Chicago.This week the markets are likely to remain focused on theMideast, and if it remains relatively quiet, prices may ease.                                                                                                          Cocoa                                                                                                          Futures prices boomed Friday, with the December contractending $158 a metric ton higher at $1,381. But the rallyisn't expected to continue this week.   According to analysts, there were no new fundamentaldevelopments to account for the strong buying. Demanddeveloped in London early in the day as traders boughtcontracts because that market will be closed for a holidaytoday.   The New York market was described by one analyst asspeculative and technical. Buying by traders who had soldshort in anticipation of falling prices caused the Decembercontract to rally above $1,250 and then $1,300, two keyresistance levels. At those points, a large number of buyorders were activated, pushing prices even higher.   However, one analyst said, &quot;In the absence of freshfundamental factors, I don't think the rally can continue formore than a day or two at the most.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
