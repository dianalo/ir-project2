The maker of glass fiber insulation and other construction products earned $16.3 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $44.1 million, or $1.48 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 7.1% to $897.6 million from $966.6 million, mainly because 1985 results for the aerospace and strategic materials group included two extra weeks and because asphalt-products prices dropped.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Owens-Corning closed at $20.25, up 62.5 cents.    Contributing to the decline in net income were a $12 million U.S. income tax provision on undistributed earnings from foreign operations and an $18.7 million after-tax increase in the cost of borrowed funds resulting from the recapitalization.    To finance the recapitalization, Owens-Corning borrowed about $1.5 billion from banks and raised $300 million from the sale of senior subordinated debt, which boosted its total debt to $2.6 billion. The company is paying down the debt by selling units, including the aerospace group, and is restructuring by closing and consolidating other units and discontinuing certain products to concentrate on core businesses.    A company spokesman said the asset sale is moving more quickly than expected and the restructuring should be &quot;largely complete&quot; in the first quarter of 1987, instead of the third quarter, as originally planned. The spokesman said Owens-Corning also is getting higher prices for the units than expected, which is allowing it to cut borrowing costs faster than planned.    As part of the recapitalization, shareholders also received one share of common stock in the newly recapitalized company. This boosted the average number of shares and common stock equivalent shares outstanding in the fourth quarter to 37.4 million from 29.7 million a year ago. The company said the rise diluted the fourth-quarter per-share calculation by seven cents.    Santa Monica, Calif.-based Wickes last fall launched a hostile $74-a-share tender offer for Owens-Corning, but backed off after Owens-Corning announced its recapitalization plan.    For the year, Owens-Corning reported an 88.1% decline in net income to $15.6 million, or 49 cents a share, from $131.2 million, or $4.42 a share, in 1985. Sales for the year rose 10.3% to $3.64 billion from $3.3 billion in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
