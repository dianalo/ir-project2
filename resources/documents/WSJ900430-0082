It used to be incentives were just for managers, but now,more companies are dangling monetary rewards to motivategroups of lower-level employees. A new survey by consultantsTowers Perrin shows that half of such group incentive plansfound at 144 companies came into being in the past two years.   After severely paring staff in recent years, companiesview performance and profit incentives as a way to squeezequality and productivity improvements from remaining workers,while giving them greater control over their financial fates.   At Borden Inc., some 28,000 workers at 180 differentplants can win bonuses ranging from $250 to $800 each thisyear, depending on how their individual plants performagainst a variety of attendance, safety, quality, productionand financial goals.   These plans were revised from one a few years back inwhich Borden tried to peg incentives to return on equity. Thefood-products company concluded that such a technicalfinancial target was &quot;too difficult for the hourly employeeto understand,&quot; says Allan L. Miller, senior vice presidentand chief administrative officer.   Towers Perrin agrees, saying incentive plans work bestwhen workers can actually see how they influence targets, asin the case of reducing waste or improving products comingoff their production line.   Among the plans Towers Perrin studied, payments to workersfor meeting or exceeding group goals averaged $1,300 perparticipant. &quot;Companies are using these programs as a way tocreate a competitive advantage through their work force,&quot;says James E. Nickel, head of the firm's alternative rewardspractice.   Under 13 of 21 incentive plans at Monsanto Co., rewardsaren't simply add-on bonuses, but represent a share ofscheduled salary increases. Meeting goals brings employees upto par; exceeding them means extra cash.   &quot;We used to focus on pay to attract, retain and motivate,&quot;says Barry Bingham, Monsanto's corporate compensationdirector. &quot;Now, we're using pay as a tool to drive results.&quot;                                                                                                          Push a Phone Button,   Save Mundane Steps                                                                                                          PUSH-BUTTON phones, with new uses, are becoming animportant corporate tool to increase efficiency and reducetedium for workers.   Employees of Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Co., a NewJersey utility, can call a special line and run throughpush-button programs to check health benefits or arrangeloans from their pension plans. Burroughs Wellcome runs acomputerized line that screens for experience and careerinterests and then describes jobs for which callers arequalified.   While such systems, costing as much as $200,000, can givecompanies an excuse to eliminate jobs, they can also &quot;freehuman resources and administrative people from answeringroutine and mundane questions, to use their skills in otherareas,&quot; says Nenette Kress, a consultant with Coopers andamp;Lybrand and a manager of the firm's communications practice.   Under pressure to quickly dissolve a $100-million employeestock ownership plan to avoid a $10-million tax penalty,Nabisco Brands Inc. last fall asked 12,000 people to call inpush-button instructions for handling proceeds from theiraccounts. Many called the line after work and fewer than 50queries a day were handled by a staffed help line, says SteveAwerman, manager of savings plan administration at the RJRNabisco Inc. unit.   By contrast, he says, manually managing the tender offervote among stock-holding employees during the buy-out of RJRearlier last year was a disaster. It took twice as long, hesays, with four benefits department employees handling up to400 queries a day for weeks.                                                                                                          Top Execs Are Loyal,   But First to Themselves                                                                                                          WITH THE AX swinging and job-security waning among middlemanagers and hourly employees, high-level executives may bethe only ones upholding corporate loyalty these days. Or arethey?   A new survey suggests that allegiance to company iswavering at the top, too. Of 551 senior executivesquestioned, more than 90% said they are loyal to theirsubordinates and are willing to work &quot;beyond what isexpected&quot; by their companies. But at the same time, nearlyhalf said they are &quot;always interested in other careeropportunities&quot; while just one-third said they aren't.   &quot;It says something about the position they're in,&quot; saysCharles C. Jett, a partner with McFeely Wackerle Jett, theChicago executive search firm that sponsored the survey. &quot;Ifyou're LBO'd out of existence, you're in outplacement, soyou'd better keep your ear to the ground.&quot;   While several executives said companies could renew atradition of loyalty by investing more in employee careertraining and development, others were more cynical. Onewrote: &quot;Maybe you cannot be loyal to or expect loyalty fromanything that does not bleed when cut.&quot;   Odds and Ends                                                                                                          IN TO AFRICA: Two American black M.B.A. students from theUniversity of Virginia's Darden School of Business spenttheir spring break last month in South Africa, cultivatingcorporate contacts and exploring a possible exchange programbetween the U.S. school and the University of WitwatersrandBusiness School in Johannesburg. . . . &quot;Z&quot; is the author ofthe &quot;Black Book of Executive Politics,&quot; a guide to get-aheadploys that the National Institute of Business Management willmail to newsletter subscribers &quot;in a plain wrapper.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
