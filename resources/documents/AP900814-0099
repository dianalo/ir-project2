COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The proportion of women in medical schoolscontinues to grow but the percentage of black and Hispanicenrollments is largely stagnant, according to a report by theAmerican Medical Association.   One medical school dean says that's a symptom of the ``lipservice'' that the nation has given to minority medical education.   In the past 10 years, female enrollment at medical schools hasjumped from 16,315, or 25.4 percent, to 23,501, or 36.1 percent,said a report in Wednesday's Journal of the American MedicalAssociation.   Minority medical enrollment has remained about level, with the4,076 black medical students last year amounting to 6.3 of allenrollees, and the 3,518 Hispanics making up 5.5 percent of medicalstudents, the report said.   A decade ago, total black enrollment was 3,708, or 5.5 percent,the AMA said. In 1979, the closest year for which comparablefigures are available, Hispanic enrollment was 2,289, or 3.7percent, it said.   ``Since the early 1970s, there has been a national commitment toexpand the opportunities for members of minority groups to entermedicine and other health professions,'' said the first report,headed by Dr. Harry S. Jonas, director of the AMA's Divison ofUndergraduate Medical Education.   ``Despite this commitment, the percentage of black and Hispanicapplicants and matriculants has not shown a significant rise.''   William Wallace, associate dean of the University of IllinoisSchool of Medicine at Chicago, disagreed with that assessment.   ``I don't think there has been a national commitment (to recruitminority medical students),'' said Wallace, whose school has one ofthe largest minority enrollments in the country. ``The commitmenthas been more lip service than a national commitment.''   For example, the federal government is giving the University ofIllinois' medical school less money this year than last forminority recruitment, or a total of $140,000, he said.   The high cost of medical education may be one factordiscouraging potential minority applicants, another report in theJournal said.   The average debt for medical students who borrowed money was$42,374 at graduation in 1989, up more than $4,000 from only a yearearlier. Four of five graduates were in debt.   For minorities, the debt burden averaged about $6,000 higher,said researchers led by Paul Jolly of the Association of AmericanMedical Colleges in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
