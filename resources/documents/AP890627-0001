Bush indicated in a news conference that he has not made hisfinal decisions on what he will propose Thursday in the way ofrevamping the federal campaign finance laws.   But officials said he is considering a version of his previouslyannounced wish for a ban on political action committeecontributions, which in the 1988 election amounted to $151.3 millionfor congressional campaigns, according to Federal ElectionCommission records.   One administration official, speaking only on condition ofanonymity, said other proposals Bush is reviewing include:   _Barring members of Congress from carrying over campaign fundsurpluses from one election to the next. Members who win their raceshandily sometimes amass huge warchests by rolling over the fundsfrom one year to the next.   _Setting up a system in which executive branch agencies wouldhave to log calls they received from members of Congress trying tosway them on a policy.   _Limiting the amount congressional incumbents could spend onmailings with their ``franking'' privileges. Critics say thesemailings to constituents give the incumbents unfair advantage overelection challengers at the expense of the taxpayers.   Bush has made at least one decision, according to unidentifiedofficials quoted in Wednesday editions of The Washington Post: toseek legislation outlawing `gerrymandering,'' the drawing ofcongressional districts to favor one party.   Bush would request a new requirement _ that districts be compact,contiguous and respecting community boundaries in addition tocurrent court-enforced requirements that a state's districtscontains equal numbers of people as nearly as possible.   Instead of ruling out all PACs, the options he is now consideringwould ban corporate or labor union PACs, according to the official.The options would allow those that are not connected to such groups,so-called ideological PACs that are centered on a politicalphilosophy or agenda.   The president also is looking at the possibility of lowering thecurrent $5,000 per candidate limit for PAC contributions to $1,000.   In the category of banned PACs, if Bush agrees to this option,would be so-called leadership PACs, those headed by politicians andused to dispense campaign funds to other candidates. They also areused as a springboard for presidential candidates, including Bush,who headed the one of the nation's two most successful PACs in theyears before his presidential bid.   Bush told reporters that one proposal he will not adopt is asystem of public financing for congressional campaigns, as is nowthe system for the presidential elections.   ``I oppose public financing of these campaigns. I think peopleshould be able to attract private support, and I think participationby individuals in a the political process through financial supportis very, very important,'' Bush said.   Current law allows individuals to contribute a maximum of $1,000per candidate in each election, while PACs may give $5,000.   Some groups and members of Congress advocate setting up a federalfund to pay for congressional races after the model now used for thepresidential elections and supported by the voluntary $1 checkoff onindividual income tax forms.   Besides speaking against that idea, Bush said he would not revealany specifics of his thinking on campaign finance reform beforeThursday, when he speaks to a group of congressional interns at theLibrary of Congress.   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the intention of thepresident's plan will be ``to strengthn the parties, increasecompetition and fairness in elections and to curtail specialinterest'' in campaigns.   ``I will have specific proposals,'' he said, adding they would be``fairly far reaching because I want to see reform _ real reform.''   If he calls on Congress to outlaw leadership PACs, he will bespeaking against an increasingly influential funding mechanism thatmany presidential contenders use in their pre-announcement phase tofinance their travels around the country to whip up support.   Officially, such PACs are set up to help like-minded candidatesfor congressional or other offices and are not allowed to fundpresidential campaign activity. But there is little doubt that theyserve immense benefit for politicians who are preparing a WhiteHouse bid.   Bush's PAC, called Fund For America's Future, was the secondlargest of some 4,000 PACs that file records with the FederalElection Comission.   The Bush PAC raised $9.4 million in the years when it was mostactive, the 1985-86 campaign cycle, second only to the conservativeCongressional Club founded by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. TheCongressional Club and its affiliated groups raised $16.6 million.   The corporate PACs were led by ATandamp;T's which raised $1.8 million,Federal Election Commission records show.   Of labor-related PACs, the Teamsters had the largest, raising$4.4 million that cycle. Among the trade association-related PACs,the Realtors' PAC raised $5.7 million and the American MedicalAssociation PAC, just under $5 million.   In the 1987-88 election cycle, Bush's PAC raised just under $2million as his presidential campaign geared up and fund-raisingefforts were diverted to it.   In the primary season, Bush's campaign received $862,950 incontributions from special-interest PACs.</TEXT></DOC>
