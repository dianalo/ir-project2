The possibility doesn't represent any change of heart by thosewho control payrolls, but instead is simply the hardnosedrecognition of an economic reality _ that there may not be much tobe gained through further tightening.   It is nothing new in American life. It has happened before andwill happen again because it is a self-correcting cyclicalphenomenon, as a bit of recent history illustrates.   At the tail end of the 1970s, for example, major companiessought to improve their net income by cutting staffs, limiting payraises and otherwise becoming leaner, meaner and more efficient.   It wasn't a choice easily arrived at, and in fact, it was longdelayed. For nearly two decades American companies had beendeveloping an enormous midriff of white-collar workers _ andbecoming less competitive because of it.   The problem was exacerbated by inflation, which rose todouble-digit levels and effectively priced many American productsout of the growing global marketplace. Change was imperative. Costshad to be cut.   One company after another adopted the same policy: Pare staffsand restrain pay raises; get more net for the payroll dollar. Somecompanies went further and closed plants, but most just watched thepayroll.   Then, as the economy recovered from the big recession of theearly 1980s, the pressure came off again. Growth was in again. In1982, according to a compensation survey released this week, meritraises rose 9.1 percent.   And then, once again, the lid came down. American companies,though more efficient now, continued to receive stiff competitionfrom abroad. Payroll-watching was in again. Work forces shrank;salary increases dwindled.   Since 1982, according to Sibson andamp; Co., a management consultingfirm, salary increases have declined steadily. By 1988, meritincreases averaged just 5.3 percent. And next year, says Sibson,the average will be 5.2 percent.   But now, it states, the cutting may have reached its limit. Thejobless rate is down to the mid-5 percent range, meaning most ofthose laid-off workers have found new jobs. Companies now arelooking for workers.   It could mean a big shift of emphasis by those who watch thebottom line. Instead of improving profits by squeezing payrolls,some companies now might have to seek results by rewarding goodworkers with bigger pay raises.   The result, says Sibson, could be the end next year of sevenyears of steadily declining salary increases and downsizing ofstaffs.   ``It appears companies may have achieved all they can in thoseareas,'' says James Mitchell, a Sibson principal who managed thesurvey, the results of which are based on responses from 653companies.   Many companies are much leaner today than four years ago, saidMichell, adding that the key issue now facing companies is how toretrain and motivate those employees who have remained with theirorganizations.   He concludes that ``incentive programs which allow companies toshare the risks and reward with their employees will take on agreater role as organizations address this issue.''   Mitchell said three-quarters of survey participants now haveincentive compensation programs, and that many are planning toextend them.   The reason, he says, is corporations recognize they need to paymore attention to motivating workers, to rewarding performance andto increasing productivity.   And, as it was in the earlier part of the cycle, when downsizingand pay restraints were in vogue, the goal is the same: The bottomline.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Monday Aug. 29</NOTE></DOC>
