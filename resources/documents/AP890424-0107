The bipartsian budget agreement we worked out 10 days ago is akey example.   That agreement _ ahead of schedule, on target with Gramm-Rudman,and with my ``no new taxes'' pledge intact _ is a strong first steptowards dealing with the deficit problem, and keeping our economy _76 straight months of expanding, uninterrupted growth _ on track.   Difficult decisions lie ahead, but an important agreement hasbeen achieved.   And of course, there is the accord we reached on Central America.   The people of Nicaragua _ like their neighbors in the region,like people everywhere _ deserve to live in peace, with freedom.   The United States is now speaking with one voice _ and standingbehind a plan that will put the Sandinistas to the test.   And this unity has encouraged leaders like President Arias togive strong support to U.S. policy.   And in three short months, we've made a good start coming togrips with issues demanding urgent attention _ and decisive action.   And we've taken that action: Action to stabilize the troubledsavings and loan system.   The reform plan I sent to Congress will restore stability, andput the Sandamp;L system back on its feet, in sound fiscal order.   My plan guarantees that depositors will be fully protected.   The Sandamp;L system must be reformed, so that the questionablepractices and outright illegalities that caused the crisis will nothappen again _ and those Sandamp;L officials found guilty of criminalactions will be punished for the losses they have caused.   Last week, the Senate passed my plan, 91 to 8.   I urge the House to act promptly, and pass this Sandamp;L reform billwith its central provisions intact.   Action to strengthen ethics in government. The ethics reformsI've sent to Capitol Hill this month will uphold honesty andintegrity in government service _ and apply an even-handed ethicsstandard across all branches of government.   Action in the war on drugs, where we're advancing on all fronts_ education, treatment, interdiction and tougher law enforcement.   The anti-drug effort will receive almost $1 billion inadditional funding in 1990 _ a 21 percent increase in outlays overwhat we'll spend in 1989.   We've imposed a temporary ban on the import of certainsemiautomatic rifles, weapons all too often used in drug-relatedkillings.   And we're tackling the drug epidemic in the District ofColumbia, a test case for a full range of innovative anti-drugmeasures.   Of course, dealing with problems that demand immediate attentionis only part of the picture.   We need to look to the long term, as well _ to focus now on thekind of future we want to see for ourselves and our nation.   Investing in that future is high on our national agenda.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
