Loss of the exemptions would mean future contributors could notclaim tax deductions for donations to those ministries.   The IRS investigated 23 TV ministries during the last quarter of1988, the agency said in a report to Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas,chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. Picklemade parts of the report public on Monday.   ``The service is continuing to devote significant examinationresources to media evangelist cases,'' Robert I. Brauer, assistantcommissioner for exempt organizations, said in a cover letter toPickle. He identified six of those cases as involving prominent TVevangelists.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress' auditing agency today attacked thegovernment's 1988 spree of savings and loan sales as too costly andsaid it would have been cheaper in a third of the deals reviewed toshut down the institutions and pay off depositors.   Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general of the General AccountingOffice, said in testimony prepared for the Senate Banking Committeethat Sandamp;L regulators required the purchasers to invest too little oftheir own money.   Officials at the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichguarantees Sandamp;L deposits up to $100,000, also underestimated, by 20percent to 40 percent, the value of tax breaks offered to buyers,Bowsher said.   The report comes as White House and Treasury Department officialsare reviewing a complex financing plan aimed at protecting regionaleconomies from the precipitous sale of billions of dollars of realestate now in government hands as a result of Sandamp;L failures.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Secretary-designate Dick Cheney'svoting record on military issues toes the Republican line, showingstrong support for former President Reagan's record peacetimePentagon buildup.

Paul Simon, offers blunt observations on hisown campaign and those of his Democratic rivals in a new book beingreleased today.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. came off as brash, Bruce Babbitt eventuallybecame desperate, Gary Hart was a dull speaker and Michael Dukakiswas too remote, a flaw fatal to his campaign, Simon writes in``Winners and Losers.''   ``It is a candid observation about the weaknesses and strengthsof all of them _ and of myself,'' Simon, D-Ill., said in a recentinterview. ``I didn't hesitate criticizing myself and some of myweaknesses in the campaign.''   In the book, Simon faults himself for several tactical errors,but more importantly, for failing to build his campaign around a``central theme'' that would have been easily accessible to thevoters.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou beganputting the political pieces together today after his government,its credibility damaged by a financial scandal, defeated a censuremotion in Parliament.
