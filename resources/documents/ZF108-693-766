(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The small computer systems interface (SCSI) has been a nightmare for systemsintegrators.andP;  Why?andP;  Because  of incompatibilities between host bus adaptersHBAs and operating system device drivers.andP;  Result: Systems integratorsusually have to modify, or rewrite, the device driver every time they add anew peripheral and HBA to their host system.andP;  This is a laborious and costlyprocess.andM;Enter the common access method (CAM), a specification being developed by agroup within the ANSI X3T9.2 standards committee.andP;  The CAM group includesmembers from most major peripheral, controller and system manufacturers.andP;  Thegoal of the CAM effort is to produce a specification that defines a standardinterface between operating systems and host bus adapters.andP;  Benefit tosystems integrators: You'll be one giant step closer to plugand-play SCSIcompatibility.andM;Who, when?andM;Although CAM probably won't become an official ANSI standard for another yearor so, the document is complete enough for HBA vendors and third-partysoftware companies to begin developing CAM-compliant software.andP;  Dal Allan,president of ENDL Consulting and vice chairman of the ANSI X3T9.2 committee,expects HBA vendors to start shipping CAM-compliant software within the nextfew months.andM;For example, HBA manufacturer Future Domain Corp. was to ship CAM-compliantsoftware for Xenix in May; for OS/2, this month; and for DOS later in thethird quarter.andP;  The release of a Unix version is still unscheduled.andM;Other major players are more conservative about CAM availability.andP;  Forexample, Paul Matteucci, product marketing manager for Adaptec Inc.'s StorageProducts Operation, says,  I don't think CAM is anywhere near finalized yet.andO;I suspect that CAM compliancy won't be a big issue in our industry until nextyear.&quot;andM;Not all HBA vendors are certain to embrace CAM.andP;  Rich Norton, director oftechnical support at Xylogics Inc., explains: &quot;CAM defines what the HBAs haveto look like to the software.andP;  All of the HBA vendors implement SCSIdifferently [e.g.andP;  register sets, command formats].andP;  To become CAM-compliant,HBA vendors will have to change their hardware, or at least their firmware.&quot;andM;Reluctance to move toward CAM is especially common among high-end (e.g.andO;VMEbus, Unix) HBA vendors.andP;  Clinton Ballard, president of Ballard SynergyCorp., explains: &quot;The biggest market for CAM is the Intel architecturemarket.andP;  Those systems run multiple operating systems [DOS, Unix, OS/ 2,NetWare].andP;  In the VME market, it's usually just Unix, so there's not as muchof a need for CAM.&quot; Ballard Synergy specializes in SCSI software, includingROMable CAM software.andM;What is it?andM;The CAM software that HBA vendors will ship with their boards basicallyincludes three elements:andM;The XPT (transport) layer of the CAM specification;andM;The SIM (SCSI interface module) layer of the CAM specification;andM;A device driver.andM;To use CAM software, all you have to do is just load it into your system viathe CONFIG.SYS file.andM;The highest layer of CAM consists of specific library calls for operatingsystems such as DOS, OS/2, Unix and NetWare.andP;  In the middle layer are XPT andSIM.andP;  The lowest layer of CAM deals with specific hardware interfaces.andM;Once CAM becomes prevalent, systems vendors will include it on theirmotherboards, providing that the system includes a SCSI drive.andP;  Most likely,vendors will implement the CAM software in the ABIOS.andP;  Systems vendors thathave embedded SCSI on their processor boards will probably move to CAM morequickly than HBA vendors, because it's easier for them to add CAM softwarelayers: It doesn't require hardware revisions.andM;At the workstation level, some manufacturers already have vendor-specific,CAM-like SCSI solutions.andP;  For example, Sun Microsystems Inc. uses the SunCommon SCSI Architecture (SCSA), which eliminates writing different driversfor different Sun platforms.andP;  According to Tony Lo, product marketing managerfor SCSI subsystems, Sun intends to make SCSA CAM-compliant once thespecification is final.andM;Adaptec's Advanced SCSI Programming Interface (ASPI) is another example ofCAM-like software.andP;  Will Adaptec modify ASPI to conform to CAM? &quot;We'll makeour hardware/software solutions CAM-compliant if CAM doesn't limit the powerand flexibility of SCSI I/O solutions,&quot; says product market managerMatteucci.andM;Similarly, Western Digital Corp., in conjunction with Columbia Data Products,has developed the Standard Device Level Protocol (SDLP)-a CAMlikearchitecture that the company sells bundled with its FASST SCSI products.andO;Western Digital plans to make SDLP CAM-compliant as soon as the CAMspecification is complete.andM;How close will CAM get you to plugand-play SCSI compatibility? &quot;You'll getalmost 100 percent plug-and-play,&quot; says ENDL's Allan, &quot;because when you buy aperipheral, the peripheral vendor will supply you with a driver that can talkto the CAM driver of the HBA.&quot;andM;He adds, &quot;CAM will eliminate an awful lot of the problems that exist today.andO;Driver/peripheral incompatibilities will be reduced to a bare minimum.&quot;andM;SCSI + CAM = scam?andM;Burned by the incompatibility problems that SCSI has caused in the past, someparticipants are skeptical about CAM.andP;  Xylogics' Norton: &quot;CAM promises toeliminate [compatibility] problems, but it probably won't be totallytransparent.andP;  Seeing is believing.&quot;andM;Xylogics president, Peter Savage, echoes Norton: &quot;You'll see a lot ofrevisions to the CAM specification to treat situations that the committeejust did not anticipate.andP;  It's a good opportunity, but I'm not sure how muchfruit it's going to bear.&quot;andM;The degree to which CAM eases integration hassles also depends on how complexthe specification is.andP;  &quot;If the standard is so complex that it becomesdifficult to be CAM-compliant, then integration will be much tougher,&quot; saysMatteucci.andM;One company that's critical of CAM is Chantal Systems Corp., which suppliesSCSI software to HBA and systems vendors.andP;  In effect, Chantal's softwareproducts do what CAM is trying to do: provide device, HBA and operatingsystem independence.andM;&quot;CAM is sacrificing performance in the interest of simplicity,&quot; maintainsJohn Hanley, president of Chantal.andP;  &quot;There's a lot more to it than justsolving the problem of device and system independence.&quot;andM;Hanley predicts that HBA vendors won't scrap their current software solutionsin favor of CAM.andP;  Instead, they will offer more than one solution (e.g.andO;CAM-compliant software, proprietary software and software from third partiessuch as Chantal).andM;Beware of IBMandM;Two factors could delay-or even derail-CAM: IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp.andO;Neither company has been forthcoming with its CAM input, which is needed tocomplete the standard.andM;&quot;If [IBM or Microsoft] comes up with a solution that is totally incompatiblewith CAM, you'd be tom between supporting that solution or the CAM solution,&quot;says Allan.andP;  &quot;In other words, it would be possible for a major player tointroduce new support for SCSI that may coexist with, complement or replaceCAM.&quot;andM;Allan says that IBM and Microsoft will probably delay CAM finalization.andP;  But,it's much less likely that the two powerhouses will actually derail the CAMeffort.andM;SCSI: the soquelandM;CAM isn't the only important development in the SCSI arena: SCSI-2, thesuccessor to the original, SCSI-1, specification, is finally picking upsteam.andP;  (See SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, June 1989, Page 36.)andM;There are loads of enhancements and options in the nearly 600 pages of SCSI2documentation, but most observers focus on the two biggest performanceimprovements: &quot;Wide SCSI&quot; and  Fast SCSI.&quot;andM;The typical maximum transfer rate for SCSI-1 is 1.5M bytes per second in theasynchronous mode; for synchronous SCSI-1, 5M bytes per second.andP;  SCSI-1 islimited to 8-bit transfers.andM;SCSI-2's-Wide option offers 8-bit, 16bit or 32-bit data paths, compared topaths of only 8 bits for SCSI-1.andP;  At 16 bits, Wide SCSI yields a data rate of10M bytes per second; at 32 bits, 20M bytes per second.andM;Fast SCSI doubles SCSI-I's synchronous data rate from 5M bytes per second toI OM bytes per second over an 8-bit bus.andP;  Therefore, when Fast SCSI isimplemented with 32-bit Wide SCSI, you could achieve burst data rates of 40Mbytes per second.andM;Fast vs.andP;  WideandM;No companies have implemented Wide SCSI or Fast SCSI, and the industry issplit on which one will be implemented first.andP;  &quot;I think you'll see Wide SCSIturn up later this year, probably around Comdex time [Nov.andP;  12 to 16],&quot;predicts Allan.andP;  Allan guesses that FastSCSI implementations will lag behindWide-SCSI implementations.andP;  One reason: Fast SCSI requires differentialimplementations, whereas you can implement Wide SCSI with singleendedschemes, which require fewer chips and are less expensive.andM;Implementing Wide or Fast SCSI requires the cooperation of disk drivemanufacturers, who must incorporate those enhancements in their controllersilicon.andP;  And because drive manufacturers are dragging their feet on WideSCSIimplementations, some observers have begun to predict that Fast SCSI willshow up before Wide SCSI.andM;David O'Shea, a senior systems programmer at Future Domain, says, Almost allof the disk drive manufacturers we've talked to have shown no interest indoing Wide SCST.&quot; O'Shea predicts that leading-edge drive manufacturers willcome out with Fast-SCSI implementations before the end of the year.andP;  &quot;We planto have Fast SCSI out by the end of the year,&quot; says O'Shea.andP;  &quot;We don't planto do Wide SCSI until next year.&quot;andM;Western Digital has the most optimistic Fast-SCSI projection: the companyplanned to have Fast-SCSI implementations on its chip, board and 3 1/2inchdisk drive products by this summer.andP;  Daniel Brown, vice president of WesternDigital's Storage Products division, predicts that Wide SCSI won't show upuntil at least the second quarter of 1991.andM;Disk drive manufacturer Fujitsu America Inc.'s David Roy, director of productmarketing, agrees that Fast SCSI will precede Wide SCSI, but doesn't expecteither until at the middle of next year.andM;Xylogic's Norton notes that, whereas under SCSI-2 specifications Wide SCSIrequires adding a B cable, you can use existing connectors to implement FastSCSI.andP;  Further, Norton doesn't think that Fast SCSI's requirement for adifferential implementation is that big a drawback, because most drivemanufacturers already have differential versions.andP;  &quot;I think you'll see FastSCSI, implemented on current connectors, before Wide SCSI,&quot; he predicts.andM;Manufacturers of drives in small form factors are reluctant to support WideSCSI because of the space that the extra B cable connector takes up.andP;  Theextra cable is not much of a problem for 5/4-inch drives, but it's a bigproblem for 3 1/2-inch drives.andM;&quot;Dual-cable Wide SCSI has no hope of surviving in 3 1/2-inch drives,&quot; saysDavid Skinner, a consulting engineer with NCR Corp.'s MicroelectronicsProducts Division, a major supplier of SCSI chips.andM;Chantal's Hanley says,  Fast SCSI will hit the streets much sooner than WideSCSI, except in large-scale systems.&quot; He expects Fast-SCSI implementationsfor the VMEbus by the third quarter of this year.andP;  Hanley doesn't think thatimplementations for personal computer (PC) buses (PC/AT, Extended IndustryStandard Architecture-EISA and Micro Channel Architecture-MCA) will show upbefore the second quarter of 1991.andM;Although the SCSI-2 specification does dictate the use of that extra cablefor Wide SCSI, it is possible to implement Wide SCSI with a new 16-bitconnector.andP;  Consequently, some vendors are betting on Wide SCSI to come outfaster than Fast.andM;Sun's Lo: &quot;We see Wide SCSI coming before Fast, using the single connector.&quot;andO;The 16-bit single-connector approach will probably wind up in the SCSI-3specification.andM;Dual-cable software situationandM;But there is yet another problem for dual-cable Wide SCSI: software.andO;&quot;Twocable Wide SCSI has more software ramifications,&quot; says software developerBrian Berg of Berg Software Design, which specializes in SCSI-softwareintegration.andP;  Two cables means that the bytes of data must be synchronizedbetween the cables.andP;  If the bytes are askew from each other, the software hasto control and throttle the byte stream.andM;&quot;As a result,&quot; predicts Berg, &quot;you'll probably see drivers for Fast SCSIbefore Wide SCSI, because with Fast, you can use existing single connectorsand you don't have to synchronize the data between the two cables.&quot;andM;Adaptec's Matteucci agrees that Fast SCSI will precede Wide SCSI becausesilicon is already available for Fast SCSI and the connector issue isdelaying Wide SCSI.andP;  Matteucci expects to see Fast-SCSI implementations inthe Fall, with Wide SCSI appearing in the middle of next year.andM;What constitutes SCSI-2?andM;Although HBA vendors are not rushing to implement Wide SCSI or Fast SCSI,they are designing in hooks to have those enhancements ready when drivemanufacturers or customer demand dictate their use.andM;If nobody is implementing Wide SCSI or Fast SCSI, what are all those SCSI-2peripherals you've been hearing about? To date, SCSI-2 compliance means onething: The vendor has implemented the SCSI-2 upgrade of the common commandset (CCS).andM;The original SCSI CCS was developed in 1986.andP;  This CCS listed commands thatall vendors of each kind of peripheral device must implement to beCCS-compliant.andP;  Goal: to reduce incompatibilities among peripherals caused bythe &quot;suggested&quot; (not mandatory) command formats outlined in the original SCSIspecification.andP;  The SCSI-2 specification also adds extra commands to theoriginal CCS.andM;So far, the main beneficiaries of the SCSI-2 CCS have been tape drivevendors.andP;  Prior to SCSI-2, there was no CCS for tape drives.andP;  SCSI-2 CCSprovides consistent command definitions for those devices.andM;SCSI-2 also includes command sets for other peripherals, including scannersand optical disk drives.andP;  But so far, tape drive vendors have been the onlyones to widely implement SCSI-2's ccs.andM;In addition to the SCSI-2 upgrade of the CCS, some HBA vendors areimplementing command queuing, which is defined in the SCSI-2 specification.andO;Command queuing allows SCSI target peripherals to queue up commands, sent bySCSI initiators, for later execution.andP;  This feature is particularly powerfulwhen the peripheral receives many requests-it can parse one command while aprevious command is executing.andM;Although command queuing is contained in the SCSI-2 specification, many HBAvendors implemented queuing years before the specification was completed.andM;Even though SCSI-2 is far from being widely exploited, ANSI has already begunwork on SCSI-3.andP;  This specification may include features like multiple-portsupport, packetizing and serialization for fiber-optic connections, and thenew 16-bit cable for Wide SCSI.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
