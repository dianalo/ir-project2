Liemandt, chairman and chief executive officer.    Such an operating profit would mean an increase of about 47% from 1985 operating profit of 68 cents a share, or $11.3 million. After a tax-benefit of $5 million, 1985 net income was $16.3 million, or 98 cents a share. Uccel currently has 16.9 million shares outstanding.    The $1-a-share figure implies a fourth-quarter operating profit of about 43 cents a share, compared with 30 cents a share a year earlier; Uccel's earnings from operations in the first nine months were 57 cents a share. In an interview, Mr. Liemandt noted that the expected earnings gain would be Uccel's 14th consecutive quarter of increases.    While earnings are rising, Mr. Liemandt said revenue for the year would be between $135 million and $140 million, a decline of about 33% from 1985 revenue of $205 million. The drop is because of the divestiture during 1986 of six largely unprofitable computing services businesses. Uccel said revenue of $140 million would represent a 40% increase from 1985 for the continuing businesses of this computer software maker.    Six acquisitions announced last week for a total of about $60 million place Uccel even more firmly in two growing markets, systems software and banking software for mainframe computers. Systems software determines some of the basic operations of a computer. The company borrowed about $60 million, its only bank debt, to cover the purchases.    Among the new acquisitions were SKK Inc. of Chicago, and Cambridge Systems Group Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., for which Uccel paid a total of $48 million. The concerns make, market and support a popular computer security system called ACF 2. </TEXT></DOC>
