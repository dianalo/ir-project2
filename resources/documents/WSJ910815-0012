Without meaning to, the FDA has takenaway the right of a citizen with Alzheimer's to the pursuitof happiness. A patient with Alzheimer's, a fatal disease, isnot allowed to try a medication that sincere and reputablepeople claim is helpful, though not curative.   Since the authorities cannot agree on whether THA isbeneficial, perhaps the best resolution is to document theresults of treatment with THA by videotaping the patientbefore treatment and every few weeks or months duringtreatment. Also, the observations of the treating physician,nurses, social workers and members of the patient's familyshould be videotaped. Family members possibly may be the mostimportant, since they live with the patient and can observesubtle changes not apparent to others. Researchers could viewthe tapes and decide if the results were significant enoughto warrant using the medication.</LP><TEXT>   The problem with current tests is that a researcher orstatistician might conclude that the fact that only a fewpatients were able to sleep all night with a particularmedication was not &quot;statistically significant,&quot; but thefamily of a patient may find it very significant,particularly if they had been losing sleep every night, too.Or a cantankerous patient might become mellow and much easierto care for even though his memory was no better.   Since the patient and the relatives are the ones whosuffer, it seems they should be parties to the decision aboutthe efficacy of THA. They should, of course, be made aware ofthe risks so that this could be balanced against thebenefits, bearing in mind that with a disease such asAlzheimer's it is justifiable to take more risks than with anon-fatal disease from which a person might recover withouttreatment. The goal is to make the patient more comfortable-- to increase his happiness.   The other advantages of using a videotape record are thatthe actual responses to treatment can be seen and analyzed bya greater number of experts and these permanent records thencan be compared with the results of yet newer drugs. Therecorded observations of the relatives may be more importantthan scientific tests now used -- what good is it to thepatient and his relatives if a test shows he has improved inone aspect of brain function yet his behavior is stillunbearable at home?   The role of the FDA could be to see that the videotapeswere genuine and that the patients were made aware of theopinions of the FDA experts and of the possible complicationsof therapy. The final decision about trying the treatmentshould be left to the patient and/or his representative --this is what informed consent is all about. As it stands now,other people not directly involved with the patient aremaking the decisions. They are deciding, without his fullknowledge or consent, &quot;what is best for him.&quot;   Arthur C. Walsh, M.D.   Pittsburgh   ---   To nurses, your editorial about people suffering fromAlzheimer's disease because they are denied drugs to treat itwas not news. Although medical journals contain news ofbreakthrough therapies for many diseases, I have beenappalled at how many years go by before these drugs reach thepatient. Why? Because it takes an average of eight and a halfyears of clinical testing and regulatory review before a newmedicine is approved in the U.S. Almost three years go bywhile the application waits for clearance by the Food andDrug Administration.   For many of the patients we see, this might as well be acentury. They simply don't have the time to wait whilebureaucrats at the FDA weigh every risk, consult every paneland gather up the courage to approve a new treatment.   True, some wealthy patients can travel to Europe, wherenew drugs become available much faster. But for poorpatients, Europe might as well be the moon.   So they wait, and die. And we watch, and cry. But werefuse to believe it has to be this way.   C. Alicia George   President   National Black Nurses' Association   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
