Ferguson's March 6 Business World, &quot;Prop. 65Populism Is on the Prowl, but Don't Cry Wolf,&quot; givesexcellent insight into the elements of cancer causation andthence the prevention desired so ardently by the proponentsof Proposition 65 in California and elsewhere. It turns outthat the goals of Prop. 65 to control cancer will not be metat all through the expensive actions required by law inCalifornia. Excellent, reliable and validated internationalresearch on cancer causation provides the evidence for thiserroneous approach through Prop. 65.   In the U.S. and the Western world generally, about 30% ofcancer deaths, specifically cancer in the lung, pancreas,kidney, bladder and to some extent in the cervix, aredefinitely associated with and caused by smoking ofcigarettes. About 5% of cancer deaths in the oral cavity andesophagus are due to smoking and alcohol consumption orchewing of tobacco. The traditional Western nutrition, highin fat, low in fiber, and high in salt accounts for more than50% of cancer deaths at important sites, such as the colon,postmenopausal breast, pancreas (with smoking), ovary, uterusand prostate.</LP><TEXT>   Clearly, the agents regulated by Prop. 65 are not on thislist. People believe they are protected by such legislationand tragically they are not. What is needed is a change inlife style, which is slowly taking place. There are fewer mensmokers. As a result, the rate of fatal heart attacks (alsocaused by smoking) has begun to drop, as has lung cancer inmen but not women. People have started to switch to lower-fatfoods but not to a sufficient degree to make a difference.Existing data clearly show that a fat intake for cancerprevention needs to be about 20% of calories rather than thecurrent 38%.   Federal and state agencies find it easy to ban basicallyinnocuous and actually useful chemicals such as saccharin.What is needed is for legislators and all concerned in theconsumer and environmental movements to be better informedabout causes of cancer, heart disease and stroke -- the majorkillers in America -- so that appropriate effective actionscan be instituted to avoid the major part of the 500,000annual cancer deaths.   John H. Weisburger   White Plains, N.Y.   ---   Mr. Ferguson asks if a regulation focused on identifyingtrace levels of industrial chemicals that may cause cancer inanimals is &quot;the best use of social capital.&quot; Clearly, ifone's goal is the reduction of human cancer mortality,trace-chemical witch hunts are totally cost-ineffective.   The premise of Prop. 65 in California -- that chemicalsthat cause cancer in high doses in laboratory experimentsmust be assumed to cause cancer in humans -- is antitheticalto the science of cancer epidemiology, which focuses on theestablished causes of human cancer (among them, tobacco use;alcohol abuse; overexposure to sunlight; radiation; certainoccupational and pharmaceutical chemicals; and specificsexual and reproductive patterns, including multiple sexualpartners, which increase a woman's risk of cervical cancer;and delayed age at first birth, which in some way augmentsthe chances of breast cancer).   In judging cost-effectiveness of labeling foods, cosmeticsand other consumer products that may contain trace amounts ofa chemical that in high doses is an animal carcinogen, onemust ask how many cases of cancer are attributable to theseexposures? The actual answer here is unknown -- but the bestguess is zero.   Clearly, tobacco products account for one-third of cancermortality in the U.S. and a label on these products isappropriate. But are other labels really needed andeffective? For those who are &quot;warning-philic&quot; one might arguethat labeling beach chairs and swimsuits as to the dangers ofultraviolet rays would be far more effective in reducingcancer incidence than sounding an alarm about the latestanimal carcinogen of the week.
