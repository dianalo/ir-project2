Causalrelationships between emission and concentration, concentration and effect,and effect and risk have to be determined in controlled human, epidemiologicaland animal inhalation-toxicity studies to create the firm basis for standard-settingby the government. This paper highlights some of these aspects relatedto exposure and risk assessment of outdoor air pollution. 1 fig., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
