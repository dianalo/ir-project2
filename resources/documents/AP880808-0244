Oil companies hope it also holdsblack gold.   On Tuesday, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine plans to begindrilling an exploratory oil well on the southern doorstep of Parisat Ivry-sur-Seine _ the first of several wells in a program thatalso envisions exploring within the city itself.   ``I don't think Paris will ever be Houston,'' said Jean Perrot,Elf's assistant director of exploration in France. ``But there isstill oil to be found in the Paris Basin.''   The basin is a 50,000-square-mile expanse stretching eastwardfrom Paris to the West German frontier.   Exploration surged in the basin after the discovery in April1983 of considerable oil deposits at the Chaunoy field, which is ina rural region about 50 miles south of the capital best known forits tender white Brie cheese.   The Ivry site, barely a mile outside the Paris city limits, isbeing explored under a permit awarded in December 1985 to Elf,Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles and British Petroleum. The587 square miles covered by the permit includes the city of Paris,where limited seismic tests already have been carried out.   It will take as much as four weeks to determine whether Ivrycontains marketable reserves, and whether they might extend insidethe city. But, Perrot said, ``it is quasi-certain that even with atotal failure in Ivry, there will be other exploratory wells.''   Total said it definitely will drill an exploratory well, likelybefore the end of the year.   In their exploration campaign, the companies say they havealready spent more than the 70 million francs _ about $11.6 million_ required under the five-year permit, mostly for seismic tests.   There are more than 1,000 exploratory wells in the Paris Basin,which produces nearly two-thirds of France's modest oil output.Some oil also is being pumped from the Aquitaine region ofsouthwestern France and, minimally, from Alsace on the easternfrontier. All the regions together produce less than 5 percent ofFrance's needs.   The Ivry well is the first to be drilled so close to Paris.   ``If we are encouraged by Ivry, we will be encouraged to do morestudies of Paris,'' said Alexis Poutchkovsky, a spokesman for Elf.   ``We could easily find locations'' for derricks within the city,he said. ``Look at the number of wells in Los Angeles.''   Oil derricks would not rival the Eiffel Tower for attention,though. Experts say stadiums, disused factories or even adiscretely moored boat on the Seine River could serve as sites forhorizontal drilling, by which oil is extracted sideways.   ``We are looking at all solutions,'' Poutchkovsky said.   Limited seismic readings of the capital were carried out in 1986when specially equipped trucks sounding out the city depths rolleddown the Champs Elysees while Paris slept.   More extensive seismic readings showed favorable structures inIvry, nearby Orly, Chenevieres to the east, and Roissy to thenorth, according to Elf and Total, the two operators on the permit,which gives Elf a 50 percent share, Total 35 percent and BritishPetroleum 15 percent.   To the uninitiated, exploring for oil in the highly urbanizedParis region may be akin to searching for water in a desert. Butspecialists say about one in five exploratory wells in the ParisBasis are successful, or about twice the industry's standard ratio.   Still, ``you will never find a giant (oil field) in the ParisBasin,'' said Poutchkovsky, nothing the basin has proven reservesof only about 280 million barrels. By contrast, the biggest oilbasin in the United States, Prudhoe Bay, has 8 billion barrels ofknown reserves _ and Saudi Arabia has 167 billion barrels.   France knew it had oil centuries ago when miners in Alsacecaught drippings in buckets.   The Paris Basin's first well was discovered in 1958, but it wasnot until the Chaunoy find by Esso SAF, the French subsidiary ofExxon Corp., that the industry took serious notice.   About 15 companies were operating in the region at the time ofthe Chaunoy discovery. Today there are as many as 90, many of themforeign.   Triton France, a subsidiary of Triton Energy Corp. of Dallas,has been established in France since 1980. The first foreigncompany to operate in the Paris Basin, it now ranks No. 4 overallwith a production rate of 10,000 barrels a day, said EmmanuelMousset, Triton France's director of exploration.   France had a record year in 1987, producing 22.4 million barrelsof oil. But that was dwarfed by the 464.7 million barrels itimported.   Industry executives say costs of extracting the crude are higherthan in the United States and benefits remain marginal.   ``Exploration is a long affair. To recover investments is a longprocess and we are now beginning to recover ours,'' said Mousset atTriton France.   Mousset said Triton France, which is associated with Total in 80percent of its operations, was disappointed not to have a slice ofthe exploration permit for the area around the capital.   ``They have as much chance of finding oil there as anywhereelse,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
