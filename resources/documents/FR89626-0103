The ASCP respondsto the complex and difficult legal and humanitarian issues associated withthe apprehension and processing of undocumented alien families and children.At the same time, the ASCP alleviates the serious burdens upon local communitiesthat result from the entry of large numbers of undocumented aliens intothe United States through the Rio Grande Valley. The purpose of the ASCP is to provide temporary physical care, maintenanceand other services to alien family units an alien unaccompanied minorswho have been apprehended by the INS in the Lower Rio Grande Valley ofTexas.

These guidelines and procedureswill be enumerated in detail at the Technical Assistance Conference.Although the Recipient is responsible for the delivery of basic sheltercare, maintenance and other services of the ASCP, a number of federal agenciesincluding CRS, INS, and PHS are responsible for other legal requirementsof the Program and thus are inter-related and involved in the day-to-dayoperations of the program. Due to the involvement of these federal agenciesand, to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest, applicants withongoing advocacy programs for Central American and other aliens must show,in detail, how these advocacy functions and activities will be completelysegregated from the operational aspects of the program. No legal activitiesor advocacy services are to be performed by the Recipient.<ITAG tagnum="84">Shelter Operations</ITAG>The current ASCP consists of 2 complexes within 20 miles of each otherthat have the combined capacity to shelter a total population of 917 residents.These shelter complexes operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and theiroperation is extremely labor intensive. If the eligible population decreases,the main facility at Brownsville would remain operational whereas the facilityat San Benito would be maintained as a contingency site. Since February1989, the ARC has provided services to over 7,000 individuals. The averagestay of shelter residents is approximately 3 weeks.Shelter residents are not detained by the INS at the ARC shelter complexes.For administrative processing purposes, residents are deemed to be in theconstructive custody of the INS. All shelter residents are free to leavethe shelters during the day but must report back each evening if they wishto continue receiving services at the shelter. The requirement of reportingback to the shelter is for the purpose of providing structure and ensuringsafety within the shelter, and to ensure respect for the rights of othershelter residents.INS Liaison personnel are posted in separate administrative quarters atthe shelter complexes presently on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week. Theseliaison personnel provide information to the residents regarding theirstatus, scheduled hearings and general immigration procedures. No INS processingtakes place at the shelters.PHS operates a clinic at the shelter complex to provide medical screeningand other related health services. Medical services include screening forinfectious diseases, immunizations, physical examinations, pre-natal careand, as needed, mental health evaluations. If definitive medical care isneeded, the residents are referred to local hospitals or clinics. In additionto this, the ARC operates an aid station supervised by registered nursesat the shelter complexes for general sick call, first aid functions; providesa system of emergency health care services after the PHS clinic closeseach day.One of the two current shelter complexes is fully equipped with a kitchenthat has the capacity to prepare up to 10,000 meals. This kitchen facilityserves both sehlter complexes. The average number of meals prepared atthe shelter is 2,200 per day. Approximately 500 meals and snacks, as needed,are transported by the ARC to the second facility 3 times a day.The ASCP provides educational services to all school age children at theshelter complexes. Approximately 12 teachers and teacher aids are utilizedto provide educational services. Classes are held five days a week for3 hours per day. In addition, structured recreational activities are providedfor 3 hours each day.Neither CRS nor the Recipient are authorized to provide any type of directlegal services to shelter residents.
