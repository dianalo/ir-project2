<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-1166 </DOCNO><TEXT>An undulator has two properties which make it an extremely attractivesource of electromagnetic radiation. The first is that the radiationis concentrated in a number of narrow energy bands known as harmonicsof the device. The second characteristic is that under favorable operatingconditions, the energy of these harmonics can be shifted or &quot;tuned&quot; overan energy interval which can be as large as two or three times the valueof the lowest energy harmonic. Both the photon energy of an undulatoras well as its tunability are determined by the period, {lambda}, ofthe device, the magnetic gap, G (which is larger than the minimum aperturerequired for injection and operation of the storage ring), and the storagering energy, E/sub R/. Given the photon energy, Ep, the above parametersultimately define the limits of operation or tunability of the undulator.With this in mind, the authors investigated the question of undulatortubability with emphasis on the role of the ring energy in order to findthe smallest E/sub R/ consistent with the desired tunability intervaland photon energy. As a guideline, they have included a preliminary criteria,concerning the tunability requirements for the Advanced Photon Source(APS) to be built at Argonne. The analysis is aimed at X-ray undulatorsources on the APS but is applicable to any storage ring.</TEXT></DOC>
