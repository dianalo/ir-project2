In this case cooling below T/sub c/ was carriedout in both zero field (OHF) and magnetizing one (HF). Residual magnetizationdiffers essentially at OHF and HF within weak fields range, while coolingconditions effect decreases with H field growth and at H andgt;or approx.50 E residual magnetization practically does not depend on these conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
