The challenge comes at a time of sagging popularity for Mrs.Thatcher's leadership. Opinion polls published Sunday showed theConservatives trailing opposition Labor by as much as 14 points.   However, Meyer, who handed in his nomination papers Wednesdayevening, said he had ``no idea'' how much support he would get.   ``All I want to do is to give people the opportunity to vote,''he told reporters. ``It is for them to make up their own minds.''   Mrs. Thatcher ousted former Prime Minister Edward Heath as partyleader 14 years ago.   The 64-year-old prime minister has led the Conservatives tothree successive election victories since 1979. She is thelongest-serving British prime minister this century.   Nominations for the party leadership close at noon Thursday. Theresults of voting by the 375 Conservatives in the 650-member Houseof Commons are due to be announced Tuesday.   Conservative lawmakers vote annually on their leader, but Mrs.Thatcher has been endorsed unopposed since defeating Heath in 1975.   Mrs. Thatcher complained Monday that the challenge to herleadership was causing ``damaging'' uncertainty.   Labor moved ahead of the Conservatives in the polls in thespring amid widespread dissatisfaction over rising inflation andintended changes in the National Health Service.      When Meyer, a 69-year-old former diplomat, announced hiscandidacy last week, he said he would withdraw if a more seniorparty member would run against Mrs. Thatcher. But none has comeforward.   Under party rules, the identities of Meyer's nominator andseconder are not disclosed.   Under a complicated voting formula, Mrs. Thatcher needs 57percent of the votes cast to win outright. If she fails, othercandidates are expected to enter the race for a second ballot.   Meyer opposes the sale of state-owned water utilities. He wantsbetter pensions for war widows and believes Mrs. Thatcher should bemore enthusiastic about European economic integration.</TEXT></DOC>
