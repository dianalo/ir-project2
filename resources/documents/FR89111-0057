As described below, we are proposing to establishtwo new routine uses under the system notice to permit disclosure to grouphealth plans, directly or through a contractor, of a limited amount ofinformation from the Health Insurance Master Record. The term ``group healthplans'' includes health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and competitivemedical plans (CMPs) which have entered into Medicare contracts with HCFAand health care prepayment plans (HCPPs) which have been approved by HCFA.The proposed disclosure of limited information from the Health InsuranceMaster Record to group health plans with Medicare contracts or approvalsis necessary to enable a plan to determine accurately, at the time an applicationfor enrollment is submitted, the eligibility of a Medicare beneficiaryto enroll in the plan. Thus, disclosure of data in the file would enablea group health plan to identify on a timely basis whether the beneficiaryapplying to enroll (1) is entitled to Medicare Part A and/or Part B, (2)has been medically determined to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), (3)has an active hospice care election, or (4) is already enrolled in anotherMedicare group health plan. Entitlement to Part A and/or Part B is relevantto determine the extent of Medicare coverage, if any, of a group healthplan applicant. ESRD status or hospice election status are relevant since,except under certain circumstances, individuals having such status arenot eligible to enroll in an HMO or CMP. Whether a beneficiary is alreadyenrolled in a Medicare group health plan is relevant since it helps toassure that the beneficiary is not disenrolled from his/her current planand enrolled in a new one as a consequence of inadvertence or misunderstanding.A further purpose in disclosing certain data from the file would be toenable group health plans to verify at the time of an application for enrollmentthat the name and HI claim number provided by the group health plan applicantcorrespond with the name and number in HCFA's records. This helps to avoidthe processing and other complications that result from an enrollment basedon erroneous eligibility information. Since the purposes of disclosureunder the proposed routine uses relate to beneficiary eligibility and billand payment record processing, they are compatible with the purpose ofcollecting the information maintained in the Health Insurance Master Record.In order to protect the privacy of Medicare beneficiaries, we are proposingto limit the data released to gropu health plans to the minimum necessaryto determine the enrollment eligibility of group health plan applicants.Thus, only the following data elements will be disclosed under the proposedroutine uses: Health Insurance Claim number, name, sex, date of birth,Part A and/or Part B entitlement data, State and county code, status code(alive/deceased), Medicaid/ESRD/hospice code (if applicable), and currentHMO enrollment period (if applicable). As a further precaution, we areproviding that group health plans would have access only to one recordat a time and only through a CRT terminal. A password would have to beentered to gain access to the file. Both the beneficiary's name and theHealth Insurance Claim number would have to be entered to access individualrecords within the file. We are proposing that when a contractor is used to refine or otherwiseprocess data and make the limited disclosure just described, the contractorwould be required to safeguard the confidentiality of the data maintainedin its information system and prevent unauthorized use or disclosure. Thecontractor would be required, for instance, to provide an adequate levelof security for the data by maintaining it under appropriate technical,personnel, administrative, and telecommunications safeguards. The contractorcould use the data only for purposes of fulfilling its contract with HCFAand not for any other purpose. We are proposing that the following routineuses be added to the current system notice for the Health Insurance MasterRecord, System No. 09-70-0502:(14) To a group health plan (i.e., a health maintenance organization (HMO)or a competitive medical plan (CMP) with a Medicare contract, or a Medicare-approvedhealth care prepayment plan (HCPP)), directly or through a contractor ona case-by-case basis for the purpose of determining the eligibility ofa Medicare beneficiary to enroll in the group health plan. Group healthplans will have access only to one record at a time and only through aCRT terminal. A password must be entered to gain access to the file. Boththe beneficiary name and the Health Insurance Claim number must be enteredto access individual records within the file. The information disclosedwill be the minimum necessary to determine eligibility for enrollment.(15) To a contractor when HCFA contracts with a private firm for the purposeof refining or otherwise processing data and disclosing such data to grouphealth plans consistent with routine use no. 14. The contractor will berequired to safeguard the confidentiality of the data and prevent unauthorizeduse or disclosure. The new routine uses are consistent with Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7),since, as previously noted, they are compatible with the purpose for whichthe information is collected. Because the addition of these new routineuses will not change the purposes for which the information in the systemwill be used, or otherwise alter the system, we are not required to preparea report of altered system of records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(o). We are publishing the system notice below in its entirety for the convenienceof the reader.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William L.
