Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><IN> MON </IN><G> CNG EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation that would require employers to give workers advance notice of layoffs and plant closings, marking the first step in an attempt to salvage the trade bill vetoed by President Reagan this year.    The measure, passed on a 72-23 vote, would require companies with more than 100 workers to give 60 days' written notice of closing an operation that would involve at least one-third of a plant's work force or a layoff of 50 or more workers. The House is expected to approve the bill soon and send it to Mr. Reagan.    In May, the president cited a similar provision as a reason for vetoing the trade bill. While Mr. Reagan has said he opposes mandatory advance notice, he hasn't said whether he would veto this measure, administration officials said.    Because of the widespread popularity of the advance-notice measure with the public and because yesterday's vote was larger than the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto, President Reagan might be persuaded to sign the bill or let it become law without his signature. If Mr. Reagan rejects the legislation and Congress fails to override the veto, Democrats believe that GOP opposition would be a popular issue for courting voters in this fall's elections.    The provision &quot;should be the law of the land,&quot; said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), the bill's sponsor. &quot;It's the fair, the decent, the right thing to do.&quot;    Nineteen Republicans, including seven of the 12 who are seeking re-election this fall, voted for the bill. Nine of the GOP lawmakers, four of whom are up for re-election, who voted for the bill yesterday had voted to strip a similar provision from the trade bill last year.    Congressional approval of the advance-notice provision would clear the way for another try at enacting the trade bill. By first passing the provision as a separate measure, congressional leaders hope to dissuade its backers from trying to reattach it to the trade bill when it is considered again.    As early as next week, the House is expected to approve a trade bill identical to the measure Mr. Reagan vetoed, except for the provisions covering advance notification of plant closings and oil exported from Alaska. The president had said both provisions were objectionable.    During the seven days the Senate debated the advance-notification bill, Democrats turned back repeated Republican attempts to weaken the bill. The politically influential AFL-CIO had threatened to withdraw its support for a revised trade bill if a plant-closing provision wasn't a part of it or wasn't considered separately.    The labor group had originally sought a bill requiring 180 days notice before a plant closing or large layoff. &quot;It's certainly not all of what we wanted,&quot; said Robert McGlotten, chief lobbyist for the labor federation, &quot;but it's a start, a recognition of the need.&quot;    Under the legislation, the notice would have to be given in writing to affected workers and local government officials. If giving the notice would hamper a business's efforts to raise capital in order to keep a plant open, it would be exempt. The bill also would exempt layoffs caused by unforeseeable circumstances.    A Labor Department study in May showed that more than 400,000 workers in 49 states lost their jobs last year to mass layoffs and plant closings. The bureau concluded in a 1987 study of layoffs in six states that 64% of the affected workers didn't receive any advance notice and an additional 16% were told less than two weeks in advance. </TEXT></DOC>
