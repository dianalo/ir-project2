A four phase evolutionary Lunar Base scenario is summarizedwith initial equipment mass and resupply requirements. Requirements forvarious He-3 mining operations are shown and available by-products areidentified. Impacts of mining He-3 on Lunar Base development includeincreases in equipment masses to be delivered to the lunar surface anda reduction of Lunar Base resupply based on availability of He-3 acquisitionby-products. It is concluded that the acquisition of this valuable fusionfuel element greatly enhances the commercial potential of a Lunar Base.</TEXT></DOC>
