The Parsippany, N.J.-based medical products maker said the judge would enjoin American Medical Electronics from infringing patents on so-called bone healers, which use electromagnetic waves to generate pulses that stimulate bone growth. Electro-Biology said it also would receive monetary damages.    In Dallas, American Medical Electronics confirmed that Electro-Biology was entitled to about $10 million in triple damages and interest, plus court costs and legal fees. The electronics technology company said it would consider appealing the decision.    &quot;Given its current financial position, if American Medical Electronics is required to pay a judgment in the amount contemplated by the judge's memorandum, American Medical will not be able to continue as a going concern,&quot; said Joseph Mooibroek, the chairman and chief executive officer of American Medical.    &quot;We disagree with the court's action and are disappointed in the decision,&quot; Mr. Mooibroek said.    Judge A. Joe Fish, of the Northern District of Texas, isn't expected to enter a final judgment in the case until after June 22, his office said. Meanwhile, he has issued a memorandum outlining his findings. The litigants are to submit a proposed final judgment consistent with those findings. </TEXT></DOC>
