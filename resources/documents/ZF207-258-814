(NEC Corp's new supercomputer)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lammers, David.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>NEC Corp's claims that its new parallel-processing, UNIX-basedSX-3 supercomputer is the world's fastest, but market leader CrayResearch Inc asserts that overall performance with both vector andscalar processing will demonstrate the true speed of asupercomputer.andP;  The SX-3's claimed single-processor speed of22Gflops is based on the system's 2.9ns clock cycle, but the firmhas yet to fully implement a SX-3 machine, and the system will notship until the summer of 1990.andP;  Cray's 8-processor YMP runs at2.7Gflops, while the forthcoming Cray 3 is expected to achieveabout 16Gflops.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   NEC Corp.
