SpinoffOf Stake in SprintUrged by Belzberg---By Mark Schacter and Hank GilmanStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/23/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GTE UTTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   Canadian investor Samuel Belzberg is urging GTE Corp. to spin off to shareholders its 50%-owned US Sprint Communications Co. joint venture.    Mr. Belzberg, chairman and chief executive officer of First City Financial Corp. said in a letter to Theodore Brophy, GTE's chairman and chief executive, that First City has &quot;no interest in selling our (GTE) stock to GTE at a price above the prevailing market,&quot; a practice commonly referred to as greenmail.    Harvey Greisman, director of public affairs for GTE, said last night that &quot;to the best of my knowledge, GTE management hasn't at this point received any such letter from the Belzbergs.&quot; He said it therefore would be inappropriate to comment.    First City, which is 67%-owned by the Belzberg family, disclosed earlier this month that it had acquired less than 5% of GTE.    The telecommunications concern has set a special meeting for tomorrow for holders to vote on a number of anti-takeover measures. The proposals would require an 80% majority for some bids and discourage greenmail buybacks of shares held by hostile suitors.    As previously reported, GTE took other anti-takeover measures in November. GTE raised its quarterly dividend 13% to 91.5 cents a share, authorized a buyback of as many as 10 million of its 220.9 million common shares outstanding and announced plans for a 3-for-2 stock split.    Mr. Belzberg said that spinning off Sprint would improve GTE's profit, enhance shareholder value and boost the company's stock price. He also suggested that GTE's Mobilnet cellular telephone business be sold or spun off.    &quot;More broadly, the overall structure of GTE should be reevaluated . . . . I look forward to discussing with you our specific ideas in this regard,&quot; Mr. Belzberg said in his letter. He also expressed &quot;concern&quot; about GTE's management devoting time &quot;to the implementation of measures designed to further insulate&quot; it and the board from their responsibilities to shareholders.    A source at First City, who declined to be identified, said he didn't &quot;want to speculate&quot; on Mr. Belzberg's intentions should GTE fail to heed the suggestions.    The US Sprint venture was formed July 1, through the combination of GTE's long-distance operation and a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.    In the third quarter, US Sprint had a larger-than-expected loss of about $158 million. GTE's share of the loss was $79.2 million compared with a $50 million loss in the second quarter.    The company blamed the wider loss on higher operating costs associated with building market share for the long-distance telephone operation, which ranks a distant third behind American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp. Third-quarter profit of GTE rose 12% to $324.6 million, or $1.45 a share, from $289.6 million, or $1.33 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.    An outright takeover of GTE, which had 1985 revenue of $15.7 billion, is viewed as extremely unlikely because of the company's size and regulatory hurdles. </TEXT></DOC>
