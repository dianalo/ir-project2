At least two people were killed.   The small storm grew unexpectedly from a tropical storm to ahurricane early Sunday and roared ashore with wind gusting to 100mph, toppling trees and power lines, tearing up roofs andshattering windows in cars and residences.   Cleanup crews began collecting downed tree limbs and debrisMonday and the city of some 62,000 southeast of Houston quickly wasreturning to normal.   All but one of the city's schools were open Monday. That schoolwas closed because of a power failure.   Mayor Jan Coggeshall said the city would not seek a disasterdeclaration from the governor.   ``We've had much more serious storms. But for the people who didhave damage, it was very serious for them,'' the mayor said.   Initial damage estimates ranged as high as $25 million, but Mrs.Coggeshall said that after an aerial survey and ground inspectionby city officials, damage was put at $5 million to $8.25 million.   ``We don't think it's as serious as Alicia,'' she said,referring to the 1983 hurricane which caused hundreds of millionsof dollars in damage.   Some 75,000 Houston Lighting andamp; Power customers were withoutelectricity at the height of the storm. Most power was restoredMonday.   After slamming into the island community of Galveston, the stormdrove up the Houston Ship Channel, crumpling four Houston Lightingandamp; Power transmission towers built to withstand 90 mph wind.Although customers were not affected seriously by the collapse ofthe towers, traffic on the ship channel was halted by the downedwires and the channel likely would be closed until Tuesday, utilityspokeswoman Geri Konigsberg said.   Most Galveston residents decided to stay in their homes behindthe seawall instead of evacuating. No mandatory evacuations wereordered, although a curfew was in effect overnight to discouragelooting.   Several hundred residents who sought protection in shelters wereallowed to return home Sunday night.   The hurricane barely brushed Louisiana but it stirred up enoughwaves to eat away more of the delicate coastline of Grand Isle,La., a barrier island and popular resort community.   Grand Isle Mayor Andy Valence said wind was light and tides wereonly about 2.3 feet above normal, but more than 4 feet of beach waseroded in some areas.   ``We had to get in touch with a couple of the camp owners tohave them come down and perhaps shore up some of the buildingsections,'' said Valence.   At least six tornadoes accompanied the hurricane, which wasdowngraded to a tropical storm at 11 p.m. Sunday with winds at 45mph. By 5 a.m. Monday, the National Weather Service reduced thestorm again to a tropical depression. The tornadoes caused mostlyroof and powerline damage.   By midday Monday, the storm was moving through northernLouisiana and into Arkansas with forecasters warning of 3 to 5inches of rain and possible tornadoes. During the afternoon, thelow pressure center that once was the hurricane was movingnortheastward out of southwestern Arkansas and showers andthunderstorms were scattered across the lower Mississippi Valleyinto the lower Ohio Valley.   The only fatalities were a 26-year-old Coast Guardsman and his2-year-old daughter, whose bodies were found on the rock jetties ofGalveston's protective seawall. They were in a pickup thatapparently got blown off the seawall, Detective Sgt. Leo Singletonsaid Monday.   A third person was believed to have been in the pickup but hadnot been found, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
