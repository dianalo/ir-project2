We are told that the only alternative to the veryexpensive Kansas City experiment is the &quot;traditionalschools,&quot; that is the schools not participating in the grandproject. But to anyone over 60, traditional schools are thetruly competent, highly effective and drastically cheapersystem we had until about 1950, when ivory-towered,non-classroom-oriented, Ph.D.-proud educational theoreticiansstarted fixing something that worked fine.</LP><TEXT>   Before they started their &quot;improvements,&quot; Johnny came outof the eighth grade able to read and write and spell and dolong division; and, if he ever wanted to, he could takethree-fourths of seven-eighths or extract the square root of625.   Now, after 40 years of creative innovation, we find thathalf our high-school seniors can't do half of what Johnnycould.   Here are some of the shocking features of the realtraditional-school system:   1. The teacher was boss.   2. Students didn't have rights; they had responsibilities.   3. The principal was the teachers' boss. Teachers didn'thave tenure. Instead, the remarkable idea prevailed that thepurpose of the school was not to shelter teachers but toeducate students.   4. Principals had two bosses, the local (not statewide,not countywide, but local) school board and theparent-dominated organizations, such as the PTA. As long asthe principal pleased both bosses, there was a job and apaycheck.   5. Chronic troublemakers, whether teachers or students,were identified and promptly removed from the system.   6. There were separate special schools for the blind, thedeaf, the emotionally handicapped and the retarded.   7. &quot;Audio&quot; was the teacher's voice. &quot;Visual&quot; was theblackboard and the pictures in textbooks. High-technology wasthe telephone in the principal's office and mimeographmachine in the teachers' lounge.   8. The entire system was pervaded with a moral framework,a common agreement that there was such a thing as right andwrong. (It went by the name of Judeo-Christian ethics.)   9. It worked.   George W. Griffith Jr.   Jennings, La.   ---   You reported that the Kansas City public schools havenearly unlimited funding, the finest facilities andequipment, a well-designed curriculum and capable leadership.Add to these advantages a staff of competent and dedicatedteachers who are masters at dealing with unruly, troubledchildren and youth, and the quality of education in KansasCity should improve by about 25%.   Assume, though, that the vast majority of parents inKansas City are responsible people, that students attendschool and classes regularly, behave properly, acceptreasonable authority and study diligently. Second, assumethat the schools have the authority and support to correctand/or punish the relatively small number of students who aredisruptive, unruly or violent. If these conditions exist, thequality of education in the Kansas City public schools shouldimprove by about 75%.   Vernon Feen   Columbus, Ohio</TEXT></DOC>
