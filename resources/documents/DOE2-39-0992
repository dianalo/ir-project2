<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0992 </DOCNO><TEXT>Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) built a 500-kV line across RockCreek, a Class I trout stream about 20 miles east of Missoula, MT. Two190-foot towers rise on either side of the Rock Creek valley, and theline between is suspended 600 feet over the valley floor. The crossingposes a hazard to passing airplanes and disrupts the natural landscape.The area where the line crosses Rock Creek is prized for its scenic beauty.In response to public demand that BPA protect the visual beauty of thisarea, BPA painted the towers gray to blend them best in with their naturalsurroundings. The issue now is to decide between either two gray towersor two orange-and-white towers. The underlying need is to resolve theconflict of pilot safety against scenic intrusion. The proposed actionis to paint the gray tower aeronautical orange and white. Alternativesare to paint the orange-and-white tower back to its original gray; orleave the dilemma unresolved (the ``no-action'' alternative). 9 refs.,3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
