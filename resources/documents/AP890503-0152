James L. Buck, deputy immigration commissioner, said Mexicanauthorities have arrested some 13,000 Central Americans trying toenter Mexico from the south in the past six months, up from 12,000in the previous year.   The latest arrests occurred after Mexico tightened securityalong its own southern border and began random highway checks ofmotorists driving north through the country toward Texas, Buck said.   Mexico's stepped-up enforcement, combined with tighter bordersecurity imposed in February by U.S. authorities in south Texas,has significantly reduced the flow of illegal aliens, Buck said.   An Immigration and Naturalization Service task force set up Feb.21 to stem a flow of illegal aliens seeking political asylum hasreported a sharp drop in border arrests since then, Buck said.   The task force arrested 54 people on Tuesday, down from the 200to 300 daily in February, Buck said.   The task force now gets only a handful of asylum applicationseach day, Buck said. In February it was receiving as many as 200 aday. Following a court battle, INS won the right to detain peopleseeking asylum while their applications were pending.   Most of the applicants for asylum were rejected because U.S.officials ruled they could not demonstrate a well-founded fear ofpersecution at home. INS officials say most are fleeing poverty andseeking better opportunities in this country and are therefore notpolitical refugees.   As many as 2,500 were detained at the INS facility in PortIsabel, Texas, where 1,500 people are currently being held. About1,700 have been deported.   The complement of 400 Border Patrol, INS, State Department andimmigration personnel who were sent to the Harlingen, Texas, areais costing the government $4 million to $5 million a month, Bucksaid.   If current trends continue, ``probably by the end of the summer,we will begin to see this entire task force sized downsignificantly,'' Buck said.</TEXT></DOC>
