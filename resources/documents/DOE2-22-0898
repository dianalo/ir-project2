Tuberculosis deaths were ten timesthe number predicted, based on the U.S. white male experience. Of the65 tuberculosis deaths, 48 were silicotuberculosis and 16 were pulmonarytuberculosis. A notable increase was found for deaths due to all respiratorydiseases, with 28 deaths due to silicosis. Excluding deaths due to silicosisand tuberculosis left a small excess of emphysema-related deaths. For25 men in the respiratory disease category whose cause of death was notlisted as silicosis, ten had evidence of silicosis in their x-ray recordssuggesting some misdiagnoses may have occurred. An excess of lung cancerdeaths was noted among sawyers and polishers, suggesting possible effectsof abrasive exposures. No tuberculosis deaths were noted in men who startedwork in the post dust control period, after 1950. There was an excessof suicide deaths before 1970.</TEXT></DOC>
