At the end of trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.00 yen, up0.85 yen from Friday's close of 121.15 yen. It opened higher at121.60 yen and moved between 121.58 yen and 122.00 yen throughoutthe day.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225selected issues, a 43.06-point loser during Saturday's half-daysession, fell another 380.27 points or 1.3 percent to close at28,983.32 points.   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar ``was being boughtin expectation that U.S. monetary authorities may (raise) primelending rates and the nation's discount rate,'' the rate the FederalReserve Board charges on loans to commercial banks.   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told reportersthat Japan's central bank was closely watching for a possible moveby the Federal Reserve, Kyodo News Service said.   The dollar's strength paralleled the firmness of the Britishpound despite an increase in British interest rates after news lastweek of London's wider-than-expected current account deficit, thedealer said.   The firmer dollar, expectations of a move by the Federal Reserveand higher oil prices encouraged investors to take profits from therecent rally on the Tokyo stock market, pushing prices lower,analysts said.   Volume during morning trading was a relatively heavy 750 millionshares, with most activity in heavy industrials like Kawasaki HeavyIndustries, said Nick Ganner of Citicorp Scrimgeour VickersInternational Ltd.   Steels and heavy industrials were mixed, while the broader marketwas weaker.   Fisheries were helped by press reports over the weekend that saidthe Soviet Union's state-owned fish processing company and TaiyoFishery have reached an agreement to set up a joint venture on theSoviet island of Sakhalin to process catches from Japanese andSoviet vessels.</TEXT></DOC>
