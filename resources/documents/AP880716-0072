(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said today he hopes toresolve his differences with Democratic presidential nominee-to-beMichael Dukakis, but his campaign picked up petitions needed toplace Jackson's name in nomination for vice president.   Jackson campaign representatives picked up the nominating papersfor both president _ the office for which Jackson has campaignedall year _ and vice president, the post he wanted after Dukakisclinched the top spot, a convention official confirmed today.   The official in the office of the secretary of the convention,asking that her name not be used, said the representatives pickedup the forms Friday.   Jackson said later that night that he would not put his name innomination for the vice presidency, but left open the possibilitysomeone else might.   ``I'm not putting my name into nomination, but if it were tohappen it certainly is an option that would be within the rules ofthe convention. It would not be breaking precedent,'' Jackson saidon ABC News' ``Nightline.''   For anyone to place his name in nomination, a candidate mustsign his approval under party rules.   ``We should be expected to use every rule that we can to advanceour cause and expand our Democratic Party. I think we're going tohave a lively convention but it should be a wholesome and healthyone,'' Jackson said on ABC.   Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown, today declined commentabout the vice presidential question and would not say if it wasdiscussed at a late-night meeting of Jackson's top advisers withthe candidate in Nashville, Tenn.   Top staffers from the two camps were to meet after Jackson'ssplashy arrival in Atlanta this afternoon to discuss reaching anagreement.   Jackson again said he is not angry at Dukakis for picking TexasSen. Lloyd Bentsen for vice president, that he wants to negotiatehis role in the party for the fall and beyond.   ``That is unresolved conflict....I'm simply saying we are notconnected,'' Jackson said. ``I hope within the next few days wewill be connected because we want to win....We must havepartnership and we must be included.''   He also laid out some of his public demands of Dukakis, whilesaying they must be satisfied in private.   ``I suppose what we are looking at now is where does theprogressive wing fit in the Democratic National Committeee, wheredoes it fit in the campaign, where does it fit in that circle ofpeople who will be making decisions about policy and priorities? Ifwe win, where does it fit in transition?'' he said.   As he nears Atlanta, Jackson has been reaching out to partynotables, campaigning Friday night in a packed Nashville churchwith former rival Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.   ``We need the politics of inclusion that Jesse Jackson haspreached all over this country,'' Gore said. ``Jesse Jackson'scampaign is a step toward hope.''   Rebuffed by Dukakis in his bid to use former President JimmyCarter as a mediator, Jackson said he'd called New York Gov. MarioCuomo, who ``understands the steps that are now necessary.''   However, Jackson said, ``I have no idea'' what role Cuomo mightbe able to play.   Jackson had suggested that Carter could serve as an intermediarybetween the two camps, but Dukakis rejected that idea earlierFriday.   Jackson simply shrugged and said ``no comment'' when asked aboutDukakis' stance.   ``I see this tension we're going through as normal andhealthy,'' Jackson said. ``That should be the purpose of Atlanta,to move us from battleground to common ground.   ``At this stage of several previous Democratic conventions, wewere not even at this stage,'' Jackson said.   With the opening of the Democratic National Convention just daysaway, Jackson has made it clear throughout his trip that he's yetto settle his differences with Dukakis. But at the same time he'sbeen sending signals he's willing to do so, continuously hinting ofthe benefits he can bring to the Democrats next fall.   ``Matters of substance have not yet been resolved,'' Jacksonsaid. In fact, he said, stalled platform negotiations haven'tresumed, after being jolted earlier in the week by the naming ofTexas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Dukakis' choice for the vicepresidential nomination.   Brown, Jackson's convention coordinator and chief negotiatorwith the Dukakis staff told the Los Angeles Times Friday thatJackson is insisting he be granted a ``partnership'' in the fallcampaign that includes ``participation in the decision-makingprocess.''   If Jackson's objectives are not met, Brown warned that even ifJackson supports the Democratic ticket, ``Jackson's constituency isnot going to feel motivated to come out and vote for the ticket inlarge numbers.''   ``I have not encouraged or discouraged anyone about what theyshould do on Thursday,'' Jackson said, referring to the final dayof the convention when the vice presidential nomination isscheduled.   On the other hand, Jackson and Dukakis have talked twice inrecent days, and agreed to a ``diplomatic initiative'' where topadvisers from the two camps meet tonight.</TEXT></DOC>
