L. No. 100-690 (102 Stat 4181). Theyare intended to supplement existing law and procedures relative to theforfeiture of property under the identified statutory authority. The provisionsof these regulations do not affect the existing legal and equitable rightsand remedies of those with an interest in property seized for forfeiture,nor do these provisions relieve interested parties from their existingobligations and responsibilities in pursuing their interests through suchcourses of action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intentof Congress to minimize the adverse impact on those entitled to legal orequitable relief occasioned by the prolonged detention of property subjectto forfeiture due to violations of law involving personal use quantitiesof controlled substances, and conveyances seized for drug-related offenses.The definition of personal use quantities of a controlled substance ascontained herein is intended to distinguish between those quantities smallin amount which are generally considered to be possessed for personal consumptionand not for further distribution, and those larger quantities generallyconsidered to be subject to further distribution.(b) In this regard, for violations involving the possession of personaluse quantities of a controlled substance, section 6079(b)(2) requires eitherthat administrative forfeiture be completed within 21 days of the seizureof the property, or alternatively, that procedures are established thatprovide a means by which an individual entitled to relief may initiatean expedited administrative review of the legal and factual basis of theseizure for forfeiture. Should an individual request relief pursuant tothese regulations and be entitled to the return of the seized property,such property shall be returned immediately following that determination,and the administrative forfeiture process shall cease. Should the individualnot be entitled to the return of the seized property, however, the administrativeforfeiture of that property shall proceed. The owner may, in any event,obtain release of property pending the administrative forfeiture by submittingto the agency making the determination, property sufficient to preservethe government's vested interest for purposes of the administrative forfeiture.(c) Section 6080 requires a similar expedited review by the Attorney Generalor his representative in those instances where a conveyance is being forfeitedin a civil judicial proceeding following its seizure for a drug-relatedoffense.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1316.91 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings specified:(a) The term ``Appraised Value'' means the estimated domestic price atthe time of seizure at which such or similar property is freely offeredfor sale.(b) The term ``Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel'' means a vessel that:(1) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fishor an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching,taking, or harvesting of fish;(2) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by gutting,decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or brine chilling;or (3) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports fish, fishproducts, or materials directly related to fishing or the preparation offish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel or fishprocessing facility.(c) The term ``Controlled Substance'' has the meaning given in section802 of Title 21, United States Code (U.S.C.).(d) The term ``Drug-related Offense'' means any proscribed offense whichinvolves the possession, distribution, manufacture, cultivation, sale,transfer, or the attempt or conspiracy to possess, distribute, manufacture,cultivate, sell, or transfer any substance the possession of which is prohibitedby Title 21, U.S.C.(e) The term ``Immediately'' means within 20 days of the filing of a petitionfor expedited release by an owner.(f) The term ``Interested Party'' means one who was in legal possessionof the property at the time of seizure and is entitled to legal possessionat the time of the granting of the petition for expedited release.
