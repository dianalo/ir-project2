(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In one day, the number of coal miners onstrike in Appalachia increased fivefold, and many of the unionmembers who have walked off the job expect their numbers will swelleven more.   ``They're going to try to shut down all the union and non-unionmines by the end of next week,'' said Dave Evans, a Pittston CoalGroup Inc. miner. ``You'll see a nationwide and Canadian strike _whatever it takes to get this settled.''   At issue is a 2-month-old walkout by the UMW against Pittstonover wage, benefit and work-rule disputes. But miners say that's notall that's at stake: Many believe that if Pittston wins, a precedentwill be set that could reverse gains made by labor unions early thiscentury.   About 1,600 union miners have been striking Pittston operationsin Virginia and West Virginia since early April. On Monday,thousands of miners at other coal companies in Appalachia walked offthe job, many saying they have to take a stand now or lose theirunion rights.   ``It's going to be the same for all coal miners if Pittston beatsthe UMW on this,'' said one miner who walked off his job Monday atHobet Mining in Mingo County.   Underground miners in West Virginia refused to show up for theovernight shift Monday, less than eight hours after many attended arally at which UMW President Richard Trumka told them to ``rise upand fight back.''   Three West Virginia mines also reported workers failed to returnfor today's midnight shift.   ``Whatever it's gonna take to get the court systems to drop thefines and get our fellas out of jail in Virginia, that's how longit'll last,'' said Perry Harvey, a UMW field representative in Logan.   The UMW already was involved in a two-state strike againstPittston and a smaller strike against New Beckley Mining in RaleighCounty. In the Pittston strike, a state judge in Virginia jailedthree union leaders and fined the union $3 million for disobeying acourt order limiting pickets.   Monday's wildcat strikes spread to operations throughout the restof UMW District 17, which has 8,000 members in southern WestVirginia. The president of the West Virginia Coal Associationestimated 10,000 miners refused to show up for work.   ``It's fair to say that all of southern West Virginia isaffected, as far as I can tell,'' said Gary White, president of thecoal association.   West Virginia's largest coal field employer, Consolidation Coal,said only one of its operations was struck, but it immediately askedfor and obtained a court order telling its workers to return to work.   Attorneys for the company argued that when the 250 of its 4,000workers walked out, they violated terms of a 1988 contract barringstrikes and that their walkout could keep the company from meetingits contracts.   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp agreed and ordered the men backto the Rowland mine pending another hearing June 22, when thetemporary order expires.   Peabody Coal, the nation's top coal producer, saw 2,360 unionminers walk out at midnight Sunday, said Tom Clarke, a Peabodyattorney.   Pittston miners struck April 5 after working more than 14 monthswithout a contract. Pittston had refused to sign the 1988 BituminousCoal Operators Association agreement that most other coal companieshad signed. About 100 miners have been striking at New Beckley sinceJanuary.   Over the course of the Pittston walkout by 1,600 miners inVirginia and West Virginia, more than 2,200 miners, retirees andtheir wives have been arrested for civil disobedience such asblocking coal trucks.   Union leaders did not return several telephone calls from TheAssociated Press seeking comment. The leaders have repeatedlystressed that the strike was not sanctioned by the union.   Under terms of the 1988 BCOA agreement, miners can take a 10-day``memorial period'' to air grievences. None of the coal companiesstruck Monday said they were informed that this would be a 10-daywork stoppage.</TEXT></DOC>
