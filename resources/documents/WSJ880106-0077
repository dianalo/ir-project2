It is not surprising, therefore, that many governments have formally recognized biotechnology and genetic engineering as important to the future of their nations. They have targeted the disciplines involved, organized for progress, and in some cases taken a major role in directing research, development and commercialization.    In this country, by contrast, biotechnology is still perceived primarily as a regulatory and legal problem, not an economic opportunity. A regulatory structure has been fashioned that is functioning quite well in assuring the public that the science of biotechnology is safe. Beyond the regulatory concerns, however, there is a political vacuum. Historically, I think it is fair to say that our country rarely charts a long-term strategy for emerging technologies in order to assure they are properly recognized and supported, let alone to assure that they deliver the economic benefits they offer.    In other words, much effort is being expended to see that nothing goes wrong, but little effort is being expended to see that things go right. </TEXT></DOC>
