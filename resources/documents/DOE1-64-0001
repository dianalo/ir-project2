Under the modelassumptions for nominal cooling mode conditions, a parallel arrangementof the ejector with the engine-driven compressor decreased heat pumpsystem fuel consumption by 11% from the baseline engine-only case. Foran ejector downstream in a series arrangement with the engine-drivencompressor, the calculated fuel savings was 8% from the baseline. Ifassumed enhanced ejectors were employed in these situations, calculatedfuel usage reductions were 19% and 17%, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
