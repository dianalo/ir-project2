The beverage maker agreed to pay rival bidder Argyll GroupPLC #100 million ($179 million) to settle claims arising fromGuinness's contentious 1986 takeover of Distillers Co. Theaccord comes two weeks before the statute of limitations forsuch claims was to expire.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In view of the {market} stories, and in view of thetime-consuming and potentially distracting litigation, wedecided to close the final chapter&quot; on the matter, a Guinnessspokesman said.   Guinness said the settlement would result in a #78 millioncharge to Guinness, because the concern will receive paymentsfrom Deutsche Bank's Morgan Grenfell Group, which acted asGuinness's investment banker, stockbroker Cazenove andamp; Co. andBritain's Inland Revenue.   Argyll's board said it accepted the settlement because ofthe &quot;uncertainties of litigation, including the difficulty ofestablishing that Argyll's offer for Distillers would havebeen successful.&quot; The settlement reflects Argyll's costs,plus accrued interest, for its failed bid, Guinness said.   The hard-fought #2.8 billion Distillers takeover, one ofBritain's largest, catapulted Guinness into the top ranks ofBritish consumer-products companies and embroiled it in oneof the worst scandals in the history of London's financialdistrict. The affair has had a continuing price for Guinness;in 1989 the company paid #77 million to Distillersshareholders after British takeover authorities ruled certainpurchases of Distillers shares by Guinness violatedregulations.   At the center of the scandal, which came to lightfollowing U.S. investigations into Wall Street financier IvanBoesky, was an alleged stock-support scheme aimed at ensuringGuinness's victory in the takeover battle.   Following the bid, government investigators raidedGuinness's London headquarters, and police subsequentlyarrested former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders and sixothers in connection with the alleged share-support scheme.In August 1990, Mr. Saunders was sentenced to a five-yearprison term for fraud, theft and false accounting. He wasparoled this summer after serving 10 months. Three otherdefendants are still on trial, and another trial is scheduledfor next year.   But Guinness PLC isn't a defendant in the trials, thespokesman said; thus the company thinks that the book on theso-called Guinness affair is closed. The company, which hasseen buoyant operations in its main spirits lines --including such brands as Dewar's Scotch and Gordon's gin --now will be able to focus on its core business, the spokesmanadded.   Still, the Guinness affair leaves a lasting legacy in theform of tougher regulation. The scandal, which occurred atthe height of Wall Street's insider-trading turmoil, promptedthe Conservative government to impose tougher regulations ontakeover bids.   The scandal also left its mark on several televisionshows, books and at least one theatrical play inspired by it.</TEXT></DOC>
