Review Under Executive Order 12291This final rule is exempt from the requirement for review by the Officeof Management and Budget under E.O. 12291 pursuant to an exemption forprocurement regulations as discussed in OMB Bulletin No. 85-7 of December14, 1984.b. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility ActThis final rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980(Pub. L. 96-345), which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibilityanalysis for any rule expected to have significant economic effect on asubstantial number of small entities. The Department has concluded thatthis final rule is expected to have no significant effect on interest rates,tax policy or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or other directeconomic considerations, nor is it expected to have a significant effecton indirect economic considerations. The Department certifies that thisfinal rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysishas been prepared.c. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirement contained in this final rule isapproved under OMB Control Number 1910-4100. It imposes no additional paperworkburden.d. Review Under the National Environmental Policy ActThe Department has concluded that this final rule does not constitute amajor Federal action having a significant effect on the environment underthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1976)), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations(40 CFR parts 1500-1508) or DOE guidelines (10 CFR part 1021). Therefore,an environmental assessment is not required pursuant to the Act.e. Review Under Executive Order 12612This final rule does not involve issues which are expected to have a substantialdirect effect on traditional state functions or their institutional interestand, thus, the ``federalism'' assessment requirements of Executive Order12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) do not apply.f. Public MeetingThe Department has concluded that this final rule does not involve a substantialissue of fact or law, nor should it have a substantial effect on the nation'seconomy or large numbers of individuals or businesses. Therefore, pursuantto Public Law 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, and the Administrative ProcedureAct (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department has not held a public hearing on thisfinal rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Comments on Proposed Rule</ITAG>a. Publication of Proposed RuleThe Department of Energy issued a proposed rule (54 FR 30230, July 19,1989) announcing its intention to revise certain portions of the DEAR dealingwith Mandamp;O contracts' award fee provisions. Comments were requested throughAugust 18, 1989.The proposed rule included a contract clause which combined elements offive clauses which are included in the DEAR at 916.405, but which are notmandatory for use in management and operating contracts. The clause setforth in the proposed rule included a provision which would have allowedthe Government to withhold all award fee for unsatisfactory performanceby the contractor in any important area, even if that performance areawere not mentioned in the Government's PEP. In addition, the clause wouldhave deleted a provision of the current clauses which allowed the Fee DeterminationOfficial to carry over unearned award fee from one period to later periods.Also, the clause established a new requirement for the contractor to submita self-assessment after each award fee evaluation period, which would bejudged by the Government in its evaluation of the contractor's managementefforts. These provisions of the proposed rule resulted in comments andresponses which are discussed below.In response to the proposed rule, the Department received comments fromeight parties. Of those, all but two were either from the Department'sMandamp;O contractors or from contractors which may be interested in proposingon the Department's Mandamp;O contracts. Of the two remaining parties, onewas the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, and the other was a tradeassociation representing the aerospace industries.The comments received, along with the responses thereto, are presentedbelow.b. Discussion of Comments ReceivedOne commenter disagreed with the identification of the Fee DeterminationOfficial (FDO) in the contract clause at 970.5204-54(b)(2), suggestingthat it should be provided in the PEP. Identification of the FDO, by title,is provided primarily as a convenience. In almost all cases, the FDO willbe the cognizant DOE Operations Office Manager. Identification of the FDOby title provides for continuity in the event that the individual occupyingthis position is replaced. Because this occurs relatively infrequently,and could be accomplished under the proposed contract language withoutthe need for contract modification, we believe the contract clause is theappropriate place to identify the FDO. In the final clause, this provisionhas been placed at 970.5204-54(c)(2).Several commenters objected to language at 970.5204-54(b)(3) in the draftclause which would have allowed the FDO to withhold all award fee wheneverit was determined that the contractor's performance was unsatisfactoryin any performance area, even if the particular performance area was notmentioned in the PEP. In proposing this provision, DOE was concerned thatthe FDO must be able to withhold award fee for any performance failurewhich seriously jeopardizes the successful performance of the contract.At the same time, we recognize that the PEP should place emphasis on performanceareas which are worthy of priority treatment by the contractor. Accordingly,the clause has been revised to allow the FDO to withhold all award feewhen a contractor's performance is determined to be unacceptable in anyperformance area specified in the PEP, even though there may be no weightor percentage of award fee specifically assigned to such area. In the prescriptionfor use of the clause, located at 970.1509-8(g), we have added instructionsto the FDO to ensure that all important areas of contract performance areincluded in the PEP, even if such areas are not assigned specific weightsor percentages of award fee.Some commenters objected to language at 970.5204-54(b)(3), which allowsthe FDO to consider all information available to him or her in reachinga final fee determination. The FDO, because of his/her position withinthe Department's management structure, may well have information regardingthe contractor's performance or the impacts of the contractor's performancewhich is unavailable to the staff which prepares a fee recommendation tothe FDO. For this reason, the contract clause must allow the FDO to considersuch information in making his/her fee decision. However, to address theconcern that the award fee determination might be made on the basis ofinformation not related to the PEP, language has been added to this paragraph,now at 970.5204-54(c)(3), to make it clear that such information must berelated to performance areas set forth in the PEP in order to have an effecton the FDO's fee decision. We note that this provision puts into regulationwhat has been the practice within DOE.One commenter objected to the requirement at 970.5204-54(c) for a 30-daynotice of unilateral changes by the Government in the PEP, suggesting insteada minimum of 90 days notice. The commenter is ``concerned that misinterpretationof performance requirements due to such short 30-day notice may resultin an ineffective response by a contractor and higher costs to DOE,'' andrecommends a 90-day notice. The 30-day notice is not a new requirement,and is in place on most of DOE's award fee Mandamp;O contracts, without anynoticeable problem. Based on this, we have continued the requirement fora 30-day notice, now located at 970.5204-54(d).One commenter suggested that changes to the PEP issued unilaterally bythe FDO in accordance with proposed 970.5204-54(c) should be consistentwith the contract Statement of Work. We agree and have incorporated suchlanguage at 970.5204-54(d)(3).Three commenters took exception to the proposed approach to evaluatingcontractor self-assessments set forth in 970.5204-54(e). All three wereconcerned with the potential disadvantages to the contractor of revealingperformance problems or deficiencies which had not been discovered by Governmentmonitors. One commenter suggested the use of a formal presentation of acontractor self-assessment, rather than submission of a written self-assessment.For various reasons, we see no need to require a formal presentation ofa contractor's self-assessment in all contracts. No restrictions are beingplaced upon the length of a contractor's self-assessment, although it islogical to assume that an unnecessarily lengthy self-assessment might notbe well-received. Contractors will be provided ample opportunity to explainthemselves in a written self-assessment. We would also like to point outthat the clause does not prohibit formal presentations; it merely doesnot suggest the need for them. The FDO has always been free to call forsuch a presentation if he or she feels it necessary. If a contractor feelsthat such presentations are needed, this might be suggested to the FDOfor his/her consideration. If the FDO is agreeable to a presentation, however,the contractor should be ready to accept the delays in the ultimate feedecision and payment which this might entail.Also, two commenters suggested that the contractor should not be ``penalized''for a frank, honest self-assessment which reveals performance problemsnot discovered already by the Government. We do not believe that the contractorwould be penalized as a result of an honest and open self-assessment andusing the self-assessment as a basis for a penalty is not our intention.The FDO should be aware of a contractor's deficiencies in performance evenbefore the submission of a self-assessment. The self-assessment will providethe contractor with a forum to explain the deficiencies and present a descriptionof its own initiatives and plans to correct such deficiencies and preventtheir recurrence. By doing so, the contractor may convince the FDO thatits management efforts have mitigated the impact of the deficiencies. Granted,there is the possibility that the contractor's self-assessment will revealdeficiencies or problems which the Government performance monitors haveoverlooked in their reports to the FDO. However, this is viewed as a benefit,since it should result in more accurate evaluations of a contractor's performance.Some commenters objected to the use of six-month evaluation periods, setforth in the Note following the clause at 970.5204-54 as the standard forthe Department. The use of semiannual evaluation periods was based upona comprehensive study of the Department's existing award fee practicesand procedures, which revealed that more frequent evaluation periods weremore costly without providing additional benefits. The study revealed indicationsthat more frequent evaluations did not provide enough time for a thoroughevaluation, and the evaluations were not as effective a management techniqueas possible. Some contractors noted that conversion to six-month evaluationperiods would result in losses associated with less frequent award feepayments. Some suggested interim payments of award fee. Our estimate ofthe cost of award fee appraisals indicates that an average of six man-yearsof effort is dedicated to each award fee contract, most of which is spenton award fee appraisals. These costs appear to outweigh the costs to thecontractors. The Department has decided that the benefits of more thoroughand effective evaluations outweigh the additional costs. The Note at theend of the clause has been deleted and replaced by language in section970.5204-54(b) requiring six-month evaluation periods.A number of commenters disagreed with the omission of a provision whichwould allow the FDO to carry over unearned award fee from one period toa later period. After further consideration, the Department has decidedthat such carry-over provisions are appropriate, provided certain controlsare in place. The following controls are included at 970.5204-54(c)(4)in this final rule. First, unearned award fee may only be carried overwithin the same fee negotiation cycle. Award fee unearned in one fee cyclecannot be carried over to a later fee cycle. This will discourage carry-overof funds from one fiscal year to the next. Second, unearned award fee canbe carried over only to the next period. Finally, in order to earn anyfee carried over from a prior period, the contractor's overall performancemust be rated higher than in the prior period. The contractor should notbenefit simply because the award fee pool is greater.One commenter suggested that the proposed clause should provide for a specificpayment due date. This commenter suggests the last day of each month shouldbe the due date for payments of base fee increments, and that the awardfee payment due dates should be specified in the PEP. In the vast majorityof DOE's Mandamp;O contracts, the payment of award fee is allowed on thedate the award fee determination is presented to the contractor. The commentersuggests an ``interest penalty'' for payments made more than 15 days afterthe due date for the award fee determination and notice. We feel that thiscomment has merit, since the incentive of an award fee arrangement is mosteffective if the payment or withholding of an award fee to the contractoris timely. We have added a new paragraph to the clause at 970.5204-54(f),to establish a schedule for award fee determinations. Because the submissionof a contractor's self-assessment will be an important aspect of the Government'sevaluation process, we have established that award fee determinations mustbe made not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the receipt by thecontracting officer of the contractor's self-assessment. We have includedan agreement to pay interest on award fee determinations made after suchdate, based upon the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' which is therate used under the Contract Disputes Act and the Prompt Payment Act.Two commenters suggested that the FDO's fee determination should be subjectto some sort of appeal, perhaps an administrative appeal, by the contractor.Appeal procedures are inconsistent with the award fee system of Governmentcontracting, which is based on the premise of a unilateral decision bythe FDO. Therefore, we have not incorporated such procedures in this finalrule.Two commenters suggested that the revisions included in the proposed clausereflect a more rigorous standard of performance which should be rewardedby additional incentives in the form of fees beyond those allowed in existingDepartmental regulations. The Department is currently studying its feeschedules, and will consider these comments in that study. Accordingly,we do not believe it appropriate to provide additional fees as a part ofthis final rule.One commenter suggested that this final rule should only apply to contractsawarded after the effective date of the amendments, because contractorswould not have had an opportunity to negotiate their contracts accordingly.The clause issued in this final rule will be mandatory in Mandamp;O contractsusing an award fee arrangement which are entered into after the effectivedate of this final rule. Existing contracts will be modified on the occasionof the next fee negotiations, typically conducted on an annual basis. Thiswill provide contractors the opprotunity to negotiate fees with a fullunderstanding of the new requirements which are included in the clause.In addition to the above comments, certain comments were made which didnot relate specifically to this proposed rule. These comments will notbe addressed in this discussion, but have been forwarded to the appropriateparties in the Department for consideration.It should be noted that certain changes have been made at our own initiative,in the interest of clarity. For example, throughout 970.5204-54, we haverevised the language of the contract clause to recognize that Mandamp;O contractfees are almost universally negotiated on an annual basis, requiring contractmodifications to incorporate the results of these negotiations. The Notefollowing the contract clause at 970.5204-54 has been deleted, both torecognize the need for annual fee negotiations, as previously discussed,and to delete confusing language which might have been interpreted as allowingdeviations from the standard six-month evaluation periods through meansother than the Department's existing deviation procedures. Deviations fromthe standard six-month evaluation periods must be accomplished in accordancewith the procedures set forth in DEAR subpart 901.4. In addition, a sentencewas added to 970.5204-54(b) to clarify that if DOE and the contractor cannotagree on a reasonable fee, the contracting officer will determine a feein accordance with the Disputes clause.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 916 and 970</ITAG>Government contracts, DOE management and operating contracts.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.

It is herewith agreed that a base feeand an award fee, to be determined in accordance with the provisions ofthis clause, are available for payment in accordance with the clause ofthis contract entitled Payments and Advances.(b) <T3>Fee Negotiations</T3>. Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year underthis contract, or other appropriate period as mutually agreed upon, thecontracting officer and contractor shall enter into negotiation of a baseand award fee in accordance with appropriate provisions for managementand operating contract fees set forth in the Department of Energy AcquisitionRegulation. This contract shall be modified at the conclusion of each negotiationto reflect the negotiated amounts for base and award fees. It is hereinagreed the award fee amount shall be assigned to evaluation periods sixmonths in duration. If the parties are unable to agree on a reasonablefee, the contracting officer shall determine the base and award fee unilaterally,in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled Disputes.(c) <T3>Determination of Award Fee Earned</T3>. (1) The Government shall atthe conclusion of each specified evaluation period evaluate the contractor'sperformance for a determination of award fee earned.(2) For this contract, the Government Fee Determination Official (FDO)will be (Insert title of FDO). The contractor agrees that the determinationas to the amount of award fee earned will be made by the Government FDOand such determination is binding on both parties and shall not be subjectto appeal under the ``Disputes'' clause or any other appeal clause.(3) The evaluation of contractor performance shall be in accordance withthe Performance Evaluation Plan described in subparagraph (d), below. Thecontractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the determination, andthe reasons why the award fee was or was not earned. While it is recognizedthat the basis for determination of the fee shall be the evaluation bythe government, in accordance with the Performance Evaluation Plan, theFDO may also consider any information available to him or her which relatesto the contractor's performance of contract requirements. In the eventthat the contractor's performance is considered unacceptable in any areaof contract performance which is specified in the Performance EvaluationPlan, even if no weight or fee is specifically assigned to the particularperformance area, the FDO may at his/her discretion determine the contractor'soverall performance to be unacceptable, and accordingly may withhold theentire award fee for the evaluation period.(4) Unearned award may be carried over within a single fiscal year, orother two-period fee negotiation cycle as may have been agreed upon. TheFDO may, at their sole discretion, specify in a fee determination thataward fee not earned during the first evaluation period of a two-periodfee cycle may be allocated to the second fee period in that fee cycle.The contractor shall not, however, be entitled to earn any of this ``carry-over''fee it its overall performance in the latter evaluation period does notreflect an improvement over the prior evaluation period. Overall performanceevaluations in the second period which are equal to or the same as thosein the first period shall not be considered as improvements providing entitlementto the carry-over portion of the award fee pool. If the single negotiationof a base and award fee amount (fee cycle) will be for more than two evaluationperiods, unearned award fees in any one of the evaluation periods establishedby that negotiation may be carried over only to the next period coveredby that negotiation. Fees unearned under one fee cycle may not be carriedforward to another fee cycle.(d) <T3>Performance Evaluation Plan</T3>. (1) The Government shall establishunilaterally a Performance Evaluation Plan upon which the determinationof award fee shall be based. Such Plan shall include the criteria to beconsidered under each area evaluated and the percentage of award fee, ifany, available for each area. A copy of the plan shall be provided to thecontractor thirty (30) calendar days prior to the start of an evaluationperiod.(2) The Performance Evaluation Plan will set forth the criteria upon whichthe contractor will be evaluated for performance relating to any technical,schedule, management, and/or cost functions selected for evaluation.(3) The Performance Evaluation Plan may, consistent with the contract statementof work, be revised unilaterally by the Government at any time during theperiod of performance. Notification of such changes shall be provided tothe contractor at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the start ofthe evaluation period to which the change will apply.(e) <T3>Contractor Self-Assessment</T3>. Following each evaluation period,the contractor shall submit a self-assessment within (Insert Number) calendardays after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address boththe strengths and weaknesses of the contractor's performance during theevaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the contractorshall describe the actions planned or taken to correct such deficienciesand avoid their recurrence. The FDO will review the contractor's self-assessmentas part of their evaluation of the contractor's management during the period.An unrealistic self-assessment will result in lower award fee determinations.The contractor will not be penalized for a realistic self-assessment, althoughdeficiencies noted by the contractor may be reflected in the Government'sevaluation. The self-assessment itself will not be the basis for the awardfee determination.(f) <T3>Schedule for Award Fee Determinations</T3>. The FDO shall issue thefinal award fee determination in accordance with a schedule set forth inthe Performance Evaluation Plan. However, a determination must be madewithin sixty (60) calendar days after the receipt by the contracting officerof the contractor's self-assessment discussed in paragraph (e), above.If the determination is delayed beyond that date, the contractor shallbe entitled to interest on the determined award fee amount at the rateestablished by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the ContractDisputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the payment date.This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,''and is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1.The interest on any late award fee determination amount will accrue dailyand be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day afterthe scheduled determination date through the actual date the determinationis issued. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period willbe added to the determined amount of award fee and be subject to interestif not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-27476 Filed 11-22-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
