The referenceelectrodes use small (2-mm/sup 2/ active area), thin membranes of a highlyNa/sup +/-ion-conductive glass. Stable, reproducible EMF measurementswhich reflect activity differences have been observed from (Mo)Na verticalbar Glass vertical bar Na/sub 2/S/sub 4/(Mo) and Na/sub 2/S/sub x/(Mo)vertical bar Glass vertical bar Na/sub 2/S/sub y/(Mo) (x = 3), 4 and5) cells at elevated temperatures. The utility of the electrode designwas demonstrated by performing coulometric titrations of polysulfideelectrodes (ca. 2-mAh capacity to Na/sub 2/S/sub 3/) in the temperaturerange of 300 - 400{sup 0}C. The colometric titrations clearly show asharp transition from the two-phase region to a single phase at 71 mol% sulfur. The lowest demonstrated temperature of operation for the referenceelectrode is 123{sup 0}C in NaCl/AlCl/sub 3/ melts.</TEXT></DOC>
