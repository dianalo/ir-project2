Fox, Airframe Branch,ANM-120S; telephone (206) 431-1923. Mailing address: FAA, Northwest MountainRegion, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On June 30, 1989, the manufacturerinformed the FAA of a recent report from an operator of Boeing Models 727and 737 series airplanes who had discovered a discrepancy with the enginemount cone bolt nuts, Boeing Part Number 69-59074-1. The operator discoveredthat the engine mount cone bolt nuts were marked with the Boeing part numberand NAS1805 in different locations on the nuts from those previously purchasedfrom other sources. The operator also stated that these counterfeit nutshad been used in ninety-four engine overhauls prior to this discovery.The FAA has determined that more than one source manufactured the counterfeitnuts to unknown quality control standards. One of the manufacturers indicatedthat it had sold in excess of 2,600 nuts to more than thirty operators,aircraft repair station, and aircraft part distributors worldwide. On July 21, 1989, the manufacturer released Telegraphic Service LetterM-7272-89-3551 to all operators, field service bases, the Air TransportAssociation, and Boeing resident service representatives for Boeing 727and 737-100, -200, and -200C airplanes, indicating that counterfeit enginemount cone bolt nuts had been discovered and specifying a methodology todetermine the authenticity of the approved parts. Since the release of the Boeing Service Letter, the FAA has determined,in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of investigation, that various newversions of counterfeit engine mount cone bolt nuts have been producedto unknown quality control standards and that the distribution is widespread. Since the structural quality of the various counterfeit nuts cannot bedetermined, the engine mount strength cannot be assured. This condition,if not corrected, could lead to engine separation.The FAA has reviewed the Boeing Service Letter M-7272-89-3551, dated July21, 1989, which describes procedures for identifying the counterfeit enginemount cone bolt nuts. However, since new configurations of counterfeitnuts have been found subsequent to the release of that Service Letter,the FAA has determined that the method described in the Service Letterwill not reliably determine an authentic engine mount cone bolt nut.The only FAA-approved sources for the 69-59074-1 engine mount cone boltnuts are The Boeing Company and Standard Press Steel. The authentic partmarkings of the engine mount cone bolt nuts are labeled on the verticalrim of the nut base at the largest diameter; nuts produced prior to 1969may have this part marking on the sloping surface in lieu of vertical rim.An authentic engine mount cone bolt nut is identified as ``-SPS 69-59074-1-''with a single space between the ``S'' and ``6'' and absolutely no othermarkings. Several counterfeit nuts have been produced with the marking``69-59074-1 SPS'', with the ``SPS'' sometimes separated from the marking``69-59074-1'' by more than one space; or with ``NAS1805'' in additionto other marks; or with the Bristol logo ``* * * B+ * * *'' in additionto the other marks; or with ``ENGW-10A'' in addition to other marks; andan unknown quantity may have been produced with the part marking ``SPS69-59074-1'' instead of  ``-SPS 69-59074-1-''. Since this condition is likely to exist on other airplanes, this AD requiresthe inspection for authentic engine mount cone bolt nuts on all BoeingModel 727 and Model 737-100, -200, -200C series airplanes engine installations,and reporting of all findings to the FAA. Additionally, this AD requiresa revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program to ensure that onlyauthentic engine mount cone bolts nuts are installed on the engine mountcone bolt. Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days. Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assignedOMB Control Number 2120-0056. The regulations adopted herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately tocorrect an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If it is determinedthat this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation willbe prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluationis not required). A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
