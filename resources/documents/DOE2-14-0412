It is alleged thatacid rain has impacted sensitive areas causing aquatic, forest, and cropdamage. The public continues to be informed that immediate controls areneeded to avoid more damage from acid rain even though available scientificdata does not support this statement. Legislative proposals are beingoffered as solutions to a problem that is still not fully understood.Most of these proposals call for reductions in Midwest power plant emissionswithout assurance that benefits will be in line with the costs. Therefore,any discussion of the acid rain &quot;phenomenon&quot; requires an examinationof what acid rain is, the science surrounding this issue, and the currentpolitical climate.</TEXT></DOC>
