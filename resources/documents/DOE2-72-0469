<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-72-0469 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors report on the application of large turbines in wind parksfor power supply to an interconnected grid. Variable-speed systems arecompared with fixed-speed turbines (synchronous motors as energy converters).Based on the aerodynamic and mechanical behaviour of a wind energy converter,special control methods are presented which allow to reduce the momentaryload of the transmission and to damp actively the vibrations in the drivetrain of the turbine. The authors demonstrate the optimization of a windenergy plant for improved energy utilization, and various control methodsfor operation at constant speed. These methods were tested on a 20 kWwind-energy plant. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
