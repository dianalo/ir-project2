Here are some facts:   _Rain forests cover about 2.4 billion acres, mostly in SouthAmerica, Africa and Southeast Asia. Environmentalists say about halfthe original rain forest has been destroyed and at the current pace,it all will be gone or severely degraded within a century.   _Some 5 million species of plants, animals and insects live inthe rain forests, many unique to the tropical environment withpossible untold benefits to science, agriculture and medicine.Scientists believe only a small percentage of these have beenstudied.   _Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' rain forests act asa pollution filter by absorbing carbon dioxide from power plants,automobiles and fires and producing oxygen. In that way, somescientists say, they help reduce the so-called greenhouse effect, agradual warming of the Earth because excess carbon dioxide andpollutants in the atmosphere trap the sun's heat. A major source ofcarbon in the atmosphere is from the widespread burning of rainforest, a common method of clearing it for farming.   _An estimated 200 million people live in and around rain forests,including indigenous tribes that depend on the jungles forsustenance and shelter. When displaced, the natives become unskilledlaborers in countries already struggling to develop socially andeconomically.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for March 19</NOTE></DOC>
