Xicor will also get a reduced income tax rate of 10%for an extended period, and Israel's special relationship with the EuropeanCommunity makes the move almost the equal of siting a plant in the Communityin trade terms.andM;-  o  -andM;UK add-in board manufacturer Chase Research Ltd, Isleworth,andM;Middlesex,  will be showing a new high-capability intelligent input-outputcard using a 16MHz 80186 at the European Unix User Show this week, and alsopromises to show off an &quot;interesting&quot; facsimile management system.andM;-  o  -andM;Unisys Corp has introduced some network products for its A SeriesandM;mainframes, enabling existing applications to communicate over BurroughsNetwork Architecture  and TCP/IP without modification, to OS/1100, MS-DOS andUnix systems - licences will range from #10,700 for the low-end A1 to some#35,000 for the top-end A17 mainframes.andM;-  o  -andM;Adobe Systems Inc, Mountain View, California has acquired allandM;rights to an image editing software program, currently known as PhotoShop,for the Apple Macintosh computer;

Alfred Cutaia, Rochester, a primecontributor to the development of technology for mid-range computer systems;Donald Haderle, Santa Teresa, an acknowledged leader in data management andrelational database technology; Russell Lange, Yorktown Heights, a majorcontributor to semiconductor development and manufacturing; and Larry Loucks,Austin, a recognised authority on small systems software and architecture.andM;-  o  -andM;IBM also created the Ralph E Gomory Award for the IndustrialandM;Application of Science, to be administered by the US National Academy ofSciences and named for Dr Gomery, who has recently retired as IBM seniorvice-president, Science and Technology: every three years, a prize of $25,000will be presented in recognition of a scientific achievement &quot;influenced byindustrial needs, and with applications to industry&quot;.andM;-  o  -andM;There's more interesting news on the Japanese Unix saga that weandM;have been following over the last few weeks: according to Tom Mace, UnixInternational's director of marketing, Unix Software Operation's System Vdevelopment work will &quot;ultimately&quot; be merged or integrated with the Sigmaproject's own Unix work - previously there has been no indication of such amove: the  X/Open deal with Sigma is limited to ensuring the conformancebetween  X/Open and Sigma's software tools; Japan's Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry has spent some $200m on the Sigma project so far, and theproject's standard Unix workstation specification is due to be releasedsometime next year.andM;-  o  -andM;Businessland Inc's Advanced Systems Division vice president KevinandM;Compton was quoted by Microbytes as saying that his retail chain would have&quot;no trouble&quot; selling $100m of NeXT Inc computers over the next year: hescoffed at suggestions that NeXT would be unable to manufacture so manyboxes, saying that NeXT was &quot;better prepared than a lot of big, establishedcompanies&quot;.andM;-  o  -andM;Compaq Computer Corp's shares have been a stand-out in theandM;computer sector, soaring to within a whisker of $100 against a 52-week low of50.125 as recently as last August, apparently on the belief that thecompany's business is held up by sky hooks: each addition to the stream ofdisappointing figures and warnings from IBM, DEC, Apple Computer and mostrecently Sun Microsystems simply seems to drive more people into Compaqshares - but the company is confident that it can live up to expectations;Wall Street looks for $8.50 a share this year, against the $6.27 for 1988.andM;-  o  -andM;Turns out that Racal Redac Ltd got something of a bargain when itandM;bought HHB Systems Inc from Daisy/Cadnetix Inc Bought for $19m (CI No 1,190)- Cadnetix paid $77m for the same Mahwah, New Jersey based company only lastyear, but it seems that Daisy was desperate for the cash to repay some of thedebt it took on to buy Cadnetix, and HHB had not fared well with Cadnetix.andM;-  o  -andM;IBM UK will announce a new category of dealer at the European UnixandM;User Show today; dealers selling RT and PS/2 hardware using the AIX operatingsystem can be designated Multi-User Centres - the equivalent of SAA SystemCentres - if they meet IBM criteria  including staff with Unix expertise, atleast three reference sites, and &quot;a proven track record&quot;

Dataproducts also apparently put on ice ??...?? to sellsome of its properties and distribute proceeds to holders.andM;-  o  -andM;Now that the administration of the People's Republic of China hasandM;come out in its true colours, all the excitement generated by investments andjoint ventures in China has evaporated, and the market savaged shares in oldChina hand Cable andamp; Wireless Plc yesterday: at 1pm they had slumped 84 penceat 455 pence.andM;-  o  -andM;The agreement that will make ATandamp;T Co a 20% shareholder in ItaltelandM;SpA has finally been signed - and STET SpA is taking a 20% stake in ATandamp;TNetwork Systems International BV: terms of the pact were not given; bothcompanies plan that their telecommunications technologies  will converge in acommon catalogue of products and systems over time; the two companies willalso establish an equally-owned company, not yet named, to market ATandamp;T andItaltel's common catalogue of products where neither firm is wellestablished.andM;-  o  -andM;Prime Computer Inc's board has added a possible recapitalisation -andM;in other words borrowing loads of money against its assets - to distribute toshareholders, to escape the clutches of MAI Basic Four Inc; it is also seeingother suitors.andM;-  o  -andM;After we closed on Friday, 3Com Corp, Santa Clara, CaliforniaandM;joined the earnings chorus of woe, saying that turnover for its fiscal fourthfiscal quarter will be at about $112m, below the Wall Street forecasts of$115m to $120m, and that earnings per share will be below the 38 to 41 centsWall Street had expected;
