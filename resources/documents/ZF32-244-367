SullivanandM;Third-party networking vendors rallied around Apple Computer Inc.'s newEthernet cabling scheme last week with low-cost products that work with thenew hardware.andM;Asant*e Technologies Inc., Farallon Computing Inc. and SynOpticsCommunications Inc. were among the manufacturers that announced plans tosupport the new cabling system, announced by Apple at MacWorld Expo in SanFrancisco.andM;Apple's Ethernet Cabling System provides a unique connector on each networkinterface card to attach one of three transceivers for 10BaseT unshieldedtwisted-pair, thin-coaxial or thick-coaxial wiring.andP;  Apple is now shippingthe $175 Ethernet Thin Coax Transceiver; in the second quarter it will shipthe Apple Ethernet AUI Adapter and Apple Ethernet Twisted Pair Transceiver,also priced at $175 each.andM;Apple announced two new Ethernet adapters that incorporate the Ethernet port:the $199 Apple Ethernet LC Card, available now for the Macintosh LC, and the$424 Apple Ethernet NB Card, which will be available in the second quarterfor all NuBus-based Macintosh II models.andM;Apple's new Ethernet connector improves on the AUI that is standard on mostEthernet cards because it provides a more secure connection, adds aself-termination feature and lowers the power supply requirement from 12volts to as little as 5 volts, said Wilson Wong, president and CEO of Asant*ein Sunnyvale, Calif.andM;Vendors who plan to incorporate the new cabling scheme on their Ethernetboards agreed that the benefits of Apple's new Ethernet port outweigh thedrawbacks of having to support a new type of connector.andM;&quot;The downside is the new connector style, but we are happy that Apple ismoving networking to Ethernet,&quot; said Dan Schwinn, president of Shiva Corp. inCambridge, Mass.andM;Shiva plans to release versions of its Etherport line of Macintosh cards--which it acquired from Novell Inc. last month -- that are compatible withthe Apple Ethernet Cabling System, he said.andM;At MacWorld, Asant*e introduced an Ethernet adapter card that includes theApple port and a math coprocessor socket.andM;The FriendlyNet LC, which plugs into the Macintosh LC's 68020 ProcessorDirect Slot, will be offered later this quarter with Asant*e's newFriendlyNet 10T Adapter for 10BaseT or FriendlyNet Thin Coax Adapter for$349.andP;  Sold separately, the FriendlyNet Thin Coax Adapter and FriendlyNet 10TAdapter are $149 each.andM;Asant*e also announced the $179 FriendlyNet Multi-port Adapter, whichprovides connections to thin, thick and 10BaseT wiring on a single device.andM;Farallon, of Emeryville, Calif., and SynOptics, of Santa Clara, Calif., alsoannounced 10BaseT media adapters priced at $149 and $135, respectively.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
