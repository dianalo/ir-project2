Most of the complaints related to police actions at ``OperationRescue'' demonstrations by pro-life activists at abortion clinics.But others suggested a resurgence in some cities of police brutalityagainst blacks.   The commission staff cited recurring cases of alleged policemisconduct in recent demonstrations in 17 cities, including Atlanta,Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City and Pittsburgh.   Virtually none of the complaints asserted wrongful arrest.Rather, they revolved around whether police had used unnecessaryforce in removing non-violent protesters, some of whom invitedarrest as a symbolic gesture.   The purported victims were not publicly identified.   The ``pain-compliance'' controversy involves a variety of holdsthat many officers reserve for someone actively resisting arrest.   The holds include ``locks'' and ``twists'' of elbows, wrists, orfingers; the twisting of ears or squeezing of mastoid pressurepoints (behind the ears); or the insertion of fingers into someone'snostrils to pull him off the ground.   The commission viewed videotapes showing such techniques beingused against demonstrators who had gone limp as police tried to movethem to vans or buses after their arrest.   In the severest case, Los Angeles police used nunchukus, anoriental martial-arts weapon _ sort of a hinged billy club _ againstOperation Rescue demonstrators. One man's arm was broken; the snapof his bone could be heard on the tape.   ``A fundamental issue is whether pain-compliance techniques,particularly the use of nunchukus, can ever be justified in thecontext of arresting non-resisting, passive demonstrators,'' saidJeffrey P. O'Connell, the commission's assistant general counsel.   Robert R. McCue, chief of the 125-officer West Hartford, Conn.,police force, insisted some pain-compliance methods _ he called them``come-along'' holds _ are appropriate when handling arrestees whodecline to move under their own power.   McCue said his officers had used such holds when removingOperation Rescue demonstrators from an abortion clinic April 1, when61 people were arrested, and June 17, when 261 were charged.   A demonstrator who goes limp is effectively resisting arrest,McCue said.   ``We explain to the arrestee that we intend to use a come-alonghold that will cause pressure and probable pain if there isresistance,'' he said. ``If he still refuses, a come-along hold isused, using only as much pressure as required to accomplish thetask.''   McCue also offered no apology in response to complaints that hisofficers had removed their name tags, making it difficult for thedemonstrators to bring a misconduct charge against them.   ``It is the policy of our department that all officers who willbe required to physically move arrestees will remove their badges,name tags, and any other items ... to lessen the possibility ofthese items causing injury to those arrested,'' he said. ``It's justcommon sense to remove anything with a sharp edge.''   Melvin C. High, assistant chief of the Washington MetropolitanPolice, said his officers are instructed never to usepain-compliance holds against non-violent demonstrators and alwaysto wear name tags.   The commission, headed by William B. Allen, also viewedvideotapes of helmeted police charging groups of black collegestudents in Virginia Beach, Va., over the Labor Day weekend aftersome instances of looting by the holiday crowd.   It also heard from Don Jackson, a former police sergeant who,while engaged in a ``sting'' operation against alleged racism withinthe Long Beach, Calif., police department, was filmed by an NBC crewas two local officers pushed his head through a plate glass window.   ``These incidents are frequent,'' said Jackson, who is black.``The evidence of police misconduct is overwhelming; the response toit limited.''   Lawrence Sherman, a University of Maryland criminology professorand president of the Crime Control Institute, suggested policemisconduct may be on the rise as a consequence of politicalpressures to hire more officers to handle the wave of drug crimes.   ``Almost all these cases involve young officers, under the age of25,'' he said.   The commission, which has no authority to discipline departmentsor officers, is chartered to review the performance of other federalagencies responsible for enforcing civil rights laws and torecommend new laws to Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
