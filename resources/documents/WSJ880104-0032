Lee (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TNM </IN><TEXT>   Black Monday chastened the mergers-and-acquisitions crowd, but most deal makers believe takeover activity will rebound from the doldrums in 1988 despite market uncertainty and tax-law changes.    &quot;We see corporations developing their menus and having a good appetite for 1988, but maybe not for the blockbuster deals,&quot; said Robert Willard, head of mergers at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    Even the most optimistic specialists don't believe takeover activity will approach the frenzy of the mid-1980s, and some suggest it could decline 10% to 20% from 1987. Through Dec. 14, there were 4,713 corporate mergers, divestitures and leverged buy-outs completed, totaling $224.2 billion, according to Mergers and Acquisitions magazine, a trade publication. That's down from 6,028 deals totaling $323.3 billion during 1986.    Many deal makers hope that the prospect of cheaper stocks, a weak dollar, lower interest rates and significant liquidity will accelerate the takeover pace.    But that view isn't universal.    &quot;The election year means uncertainty, you have an economy that everyone talks about bravely as not having been affected by Oct. 19. I think that's erroneous,&quot; said Felix Rohatyn, who oversees takeover activity for Lazard Freres andamp; Co.    The industrial heartland may be a prime area of merger activity, specialists say. &quot;People are starting to perceive that Rust Bowl companies are pretty profitable, and that the stock market isn't differentiating between good performers and not-so-good performers,&quot; said Ronald Freeman, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc.    Restructuring the financial services industry will also proceed in 1988, specialists say, spurred by continuing changes in regulation and financing patterns affecting banks, insurers and investment houses. &quot;To the extent the regulatory climate in the financial field is less restrictive, there will be more integration and consolidation,&quot; said Mr. Rohatyn.    And retailers may also see activity. &quot;There's a tremendous range of values in retail management, which isn't reflected in stock prices,&quot; said Mr. Freeman.    Foreign companies are also likely to step up takeover activity in the U.S. &quot;There's going to be continued cross-border transactions because of the weak dollar and lower stock prices,&quot; said Prudential-Bache's Mr. Willard.    Prudence will be the byword for takeover financing. &quot;We'll see a return to the old days, when the principal takeover activity was generated by corporations with real credit, buying or selling for real business purposes, so they're not dependent on the junk bond market,&quot; said Mr. Freeman.    Continued instability in the market for high-yield bonds that are below investment grade --junk bonds --could make it difficult for many companies to raise capital needed for acquisitions or to take companies private through leveraged buy-outs. &quot;There will be just as many deals around but they'll be harder to do,&quot; said Martin H. Dubilier of Clayton andamp; Dubilier, a New York investment firm. &quot;Subordinated-debt investors are more sophisticated, selective and a little less willing to take risk,&quot; he added.    By the same token, some specialists say a number of Wall Street firms are wary of risking their own money by making bridge loans to facilitate leveraged buy-outs. The loans, which typically are refinanced with junk bonds, will be fewer and used more conservatively in the wake of the Oct. 19 market crash.    But takeover specialists say talk of the demise of junk bond and bridge-loan financings is premature. &quot;Bridge loans will continue to be a business but will be practiced by fewer firms, and we'll be one of them,&quot; said Jeffrey Berenson, head of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;The $200 billion high-yield market isn't going away, but people will be looking at a more conservative capitalization structure,&quot; he added.    Sweeping 1986 tax law changes didn't derail takeover activity in 1987, as many had feared, and 1987's tax revisions won't in 1988 either, many merger specialists say.    &quot;The changes won't affect volume of deals as much as pricing and profit margin on deals,&quot; said Robert Willens, senior vice president for investment banking at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    But some 1987 tax proposals certainly affected the mood --and indirectly, the level --of takeover activity, specialists say. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in investigating the causes of the Oct. 19 crash, is focusing more on investor reaction to a House tax panel's proposal that would have curtailed deductions for interest expenses exceeding $5 million a year on debt financing of takeovers. That proposal was ultimately withdrawn, but takeover activity hasn't been the same since Black Monday.    The biggest tax changes for 1988 plug takeover loopholes in the 1986 tax law. Congress barred the &quot;mirror&quot; subsidiary technique, popular in takeover situations because it enabled an acquiring company to get appreciated assets out of a target company without incurring corporate-level taxes.    That should change certain takeover calculations, specialists say. &quot;It used to be that an acquiring company looked for low book value and high fair market value&quot; of a target company, said Jeffry Seidel, senior tax manager at Touche Ross andamp; Co., accountants. &quot;But since mirror subsidiaries have been eliminated, we may see companies looking for targets with recently acquired plant and equipment that are currently enjoying benefits of somewhat higher book value coupled with somewhat more generous depreciation lives and rates.&quot;    The new law also raises the tax liability, and hence the cost, of divestitures. &quot;Any parent company selling any subsidiary is going to have a higher tax liability and a smaller profit,&quot; said Shearson Lehman's Mr. Willens.    And the new law drives the stake deeper into the hearts of greenmailers by requiring them to pay a 50% nondeductible excise tax on their take and on any other proceeds from ancillary pacts such as standstill agreements. That translates into an effective tax rate on greenmail approaching 90%, said Mr. Willens, who suggested that now &quot;no one will enter a takeover situation with a view of taking greenmail.&quot;    Legislation regulating tender offers is pending in the Senate, but has a long way to go before possible enactment. For now, the hot legislative focus is on Delaware, which is considering an anti-takeover proposal that would bar acquirers from merging with their targets for three years after launching a bid. The measure is stirring considerable controversy. Critics, including three of the SEC's five members, contend the proposal would stifle takeovers --to the detriment of shareholders and the benefit of management.    Delaware's actions are being watched carefully because 56% of Fortune 500 concerns and almost half of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are incorporated there. Already 27 states have adopted some form of anti-takeover laws. Many of these have been added or amended since April, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Indiana anti-takeover statute.    On the regulatory front, the SEC has proposed a rule that would ban the popular takeover tactic called &quot;sweeping the Street.&quot; The rule would prohibit corporate raiders from jumping into the stock market during or just after a tender offer and rapidly buying big amounts of a target company's stock. In the past, SEC lawyers have argued that sweeps amount to illegal tender offers and subvert the shareholder protection rules of the Williams Act, which governs tender offers. But the heads of three government agencies --the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Justice Department's antitrust division --oppose the rule along free-market lines.    ---   Thomas E.
