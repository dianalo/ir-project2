(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police chasing a 9-year-old boy who startedhis mother's car with a screwdriver Tuesday had to back off whentheir sirens caused the child to speed up to 60 mph and faster.   The five-mile chase from the boy's home in Baldwin to this southcentral Louisiana town ended when a motorist saw what was happeningand used his car to stop the boy from entering a four-lane highway.   The tiny driver, whose name was not released, tried to avoid theblockade by shifting the the four-speed car into reverse. Insteadhe backed into a pursuing police car.   The boy was sent to a state juvenile center in Baton Rouge, saidBaldwin Police Chief Al Gros. He was charged with three counts ofunauthorized use of an automobile and other traffic offenses.   The chase began when someone reported a car being driven in areckless manner, said Detective Sabria Hill.   ``I knew it was a child in the car. You could just see the topof his little head above the dashboard,'' she said.   Hill said police couldn't get too close during the chase.   ``Every time we put on the siren, he'd speed up, and if we gotto close, he'd speed up. He got up over 60 miles an hour severaltimes so we just backed off,'' she said.   The boy started the car with a screwdriver, the detective said.   Baldwin police said it was the third time the boy had taken thecar and that he had admitted to five burglaries in the past year.   ``He knew how to shift that's for sure. He drove pretty welltoo,'' Hill said. ``He seemed like a smart little fellow. I justhope he doesn't move to Franklin.''</TEXT></DOC>
