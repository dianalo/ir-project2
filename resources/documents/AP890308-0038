Members of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committeewarmly welcomed Kemp, a former nine-term congressman, noting hisappearance in itself was a good sign after poor Capitol Hillrelations with President Reagan's HUD Secretary, Samuel Pierce.   Pierce, dubbed ``Silent Sam'' by his opponents, last appearedbefore the housing committee in March 1985. By contrast, Kemppounded the table and spoke emotionally as he vigorously testifiedabout his commitment to curing housing ills.   ``Snow or sleet or rain, I think it's very symbolic that I amhere today,'' said Kemp.   He outlined several issues where HUD will take sharp turns awayfrom Reagan's administration and vowed to work with Democrats andRepublicans in Congress on the housing and economic development.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Senators Propose Permanent Airline Smoking Ban</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has endorsed aproposal by two senators to permanently ban cigarette smoking on alldomestic flights.   The measure introduced Tuesday would expand the currentprohibition against smoking, which covers flights of two hours orless and is due to expire in April 1990.   ``The time has come to protect the health and safety of allairline passengers,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., whoco-sponsored the bill with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.   At the senators' news conference to announce the proposal, Koopsaid such a ban is ``long overdue.''   He cited a recent study by the National Cancer Institute whichfound that passengers in non-smoking sections of airliners hadlevels of nicotine in their saliva and urine similar to travelers insmoking areas.   The bill would leave intact the $1,000 fine that can be leviedagainst those violating the smoking ban, and the $2,000 penalty forpeople caught tampering with smoke detectors in airline restrooms.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Sullivan Sees No Reason to Change Catastrophic Care Program</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Health and Human Services Secretary LouisSullivan says he sees no reason to change the new catastrophic careprogram financed by a surtax on elderly Americans.   ``We're aware of a number of concerns that have been expressed(about the financing provision) but ... we are also concerned aboutthe many examples of our elderly citizens being wiped outfinancially by the tremendous costs of illness,'' Sullivan saidTuesday.   ``We feel that because this legislation has just been enacted wedon't have much experience with it yet. We'd like to follow this andsee if adjustments need to be made,'' he told the House Ways andMeans Committee.   Leaders in the House and Senate also have been generallyunsympathetic to complaints from senior citizens who oppose thefinancing provision of the program, which helps the elderly anddisabled bear the cost of illness that otherwise would threatentheir financial stability.   For Medicare-eligible Americans _ those who are over 65 ordisabled _ whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least $150a year in federal income taxes, the surtax is 15 percent of theirincome tax this year. Next year it is 25 percent and it could riseby as much as 1 percentage point a year after that.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Subcommittee Approves Uniform Poll Closing Bill</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Legislation to impose a uniform closing timefor polls across the 48 contiguous states has cleared a Housesubcommittee.
