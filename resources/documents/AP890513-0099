(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspantold business leaders Saturday he believes America has seen thepeak in a wave of leveraged buyouts, but the executives said thatassessment may be premature.   ``We all hope Alan is correct,'' said David M. Roderick,chairman of USX Corp. But he added there are still ``tremendousamounts of cash out there to keep this LBO, highly leveragedsituation going for some period of time.''   Greenspan addressed a private session of the Business Council,made up of 65 chief executives of America's largest corporations.   The Fed chairman declined to comment publicly, but Robert G.Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co., said Greenspan hadexpressed an opinion that debt-financed takeovers will subsidebecause ``the easiest, obvious ones'' already have been done.   Kirby disagreed, saying there are plenty more corporate``sitting ducks'' that are potential takeover targets.   ``I wish Mr. Greenspan were right but I don't think he's goingto be,'' Kirby told a news conference after the session.   Roderick gave a similar assessment: ``Hopefully Alan is rightbut I think that when you look back you see that money markets donot tend to act that rationally.''   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily tobuy out stockholders and take over the target company. The newowners often either cut costs or sell off parts of the company topay back the loans.   Critics of the practice fear that high debt levels, particularlyin the event of an economic downturn, could endanger both thebought-out company and the financiers of the transaction.   Roderick said that while LBO's are likely to persist in the nearfuture, ``over a period of time that is an unsustainable trend.''   ``You create ultimately so much debt that in any recession orany downturn there would be tremendous negative potentialrepercussions,'' he said.   Roderick said that while companies and investment bankers canmake ``horrendous sums of money'' on takeovers, the overall effecton the economy is negative because high debt levels forcecorporations to cut back on investment, research and development.   ``America long term is paying a horrible price,'' he said. ``Weget short-term gains at the expense of burdening the corporationswith tremendous debt.''   Roderick said the negative effects of LBOs may have to becomemore pronounced before the debt-financed takeovers subside.   Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., a member of the House BudgetCommittee who also spoke to the council, said Congress hasconsidered legislation to cut down on LBOs but is hesitant to makemajor changes.   ``The more we hold hearings, the more we know, the less inclinedmy colleagues are to determine who is and who is not a corporateraider,'' Thomas said. ``The more we know, the more hesitant we areto move in and make major fundamental changes in the law.''   Greenspan has said on other occasions that LBOs may diminishwithout congressional action and that restricting the tax deductionfor corporate debt could be dangerous to the economy.   Roderick said even corporate leaders who are concerned aboutdebt-financed takeovers don't want legislative relief. ``We don'twant Congress ... getting into the middle to say that this companycannot buy this company or this individual cannot buy thatcompany,'' Roderick said. ``The free market in the final analysesis the best judge.''   The Business Council was gathered this weekend for itssemiannual retreat at a Virginia resort. On Friday, the groupreleased an economic forecast the predicts a sharp slowdown ingrowth later this year but an upturn by the end of 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
