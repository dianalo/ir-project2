But the Johnston, R.I., woman struck a defiant tone, describingas ``almost a challenge'' the high court's decision Monday not toreview a judge's order restricting her overnight male guests.   ``I'd love to see what official is going to enforce'' it, shesaid.   Mrs. Parrillo said she is no longer dating the man involved inthe case, but her new boyfriend sometimes sleeps over while thechildren are home.   A judge ordered the visitation limit as an outgrowth of achild-custody battle between Mrs. Parrillo and her former husband,and a lawyer representing the woman said the order has a sexistovertone.   ``I would be surprised if judges were as willing to serve asmoral guardians of a family where a man is involved,'' said StevenBrown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union'sRhode Island chapter.   Thomas DeSimone, an attorney for Mrs. Parrillo's former husband,Justin, said he was not surprised by the court's action because hedid not feel that a federal question was involved.   And Brown said he believed the high court chose not to take thecase because the justices felt it was ``simply a strange littlecase from Rhode Island that didn't deserve the court's attention.''   The Parrillos were divorced in 1986. Under a joint custodyagreement, their three children live with her and their father hasvisitation privileges.   Mrs. Parrillo, 33, said her ex-husband began to harass her whenhe learned she was dating Joseph DiPippo. She asked for a courtorder limiting Parrillo's visitation rights, requiring him to seethe children at specific times away from the home.   Parrillo countered by asking a judge to prevent Mrs. Parrillofrom having overnight male guests.   Judge William Goldberg, who has since retired, barred Mrs.Parrillo ``from allowing any unrelated males to stay overnight''when the children are home. The judge said having such guests isnot ``a suitable arrangement for the children to be put into.''   The children were 8, 10 and 13 when the judge issued his orderin late 1986.   The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld Goldberg's order in March,saying ``We cannot fault (Goldberg's) actions. We see no greatconstitutional issue in this controversy.''   Neither side had sought experts to testify about thepsychological effect of the visits on the children.   In other matters, the high court:   _Removed the last legal obstacle to carrying out a $2.5 billionsettlement for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth-control device.   _Agreed to decide in a case from Illinois whether lawsuitscharging employers with violating a key federal anti-bias law mustbe filed in federal, not state, courts.   _Heard arguments in an Oregon case over the asserted right touse the hallucinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice. Adecision is expected by July.   _Agreed to decide in a New York case whether a motorist whopleads guilty to drunken driving and related traffic offenses in afatal car crash later may be prosecuted for homicide and assault.</TEXT></DOC>
