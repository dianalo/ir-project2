The founding congress of Shchit, Russian for ``shield,'' wentahead despite heavy opposition from military officials, spokesmanDmitri Chechell said.   He said the group wants to help soldiers and sailors battlecorruption in the armed forces and make sure the military is notused as it was at Tbilisi in April, when soldiers chargedpro-independence protesters. Twenty people died in the unrest inthe city, the capital of Georgia.   Chechell said many of the delegates to the congress left theirmilitary units illegally to attend Saturday's meeting. He said somewere even placed under house arrest to prevent them from coming.   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, KGB chairman VladimirA. Kryuchkov and other top officials were invited but failed toappear, Chechell said.   However, Communist Party gadfly Boris N. Yeltsin and otherprogressive Soviet lawmakers did attend, he said.   Shchit will fight ``arbitrariness, nepotism, corruption andcover-ups,'' Chechell said.   The group is calling for fewer top-ranking officers and limitson dishonorable discharges, which are often used as ``revengeagainst inconveniently honorable people,'' he said.   He said organizers expect to encounter major opposition fromauthorities when they try to officially register the new group asan organization.   The congress was scheduled to continue through Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
