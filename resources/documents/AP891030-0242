ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The home of a witness's mother is firebombed.An informant is shot after being accidentally exposed by theprosecution. A judge worries about jurors' safety so much hedebates having them wear masks in court.   Small wonder this trial is being conducted behind bullet-proofplastic 1{ inches thick.   The chief actor in this real-life script is 24-year-old RayfulEdmond III who, according to prosecutors, was president and chiefexecutive officer of ``one of the largest business enterprises inthe Washington, D.C., area.''   Edmond is alleged by the government to have run the largestcocaine ring in the history of the District of Columbia: $2 milliona week, 70 pounds of cocaine a month, 30 killings along the way.   The supporting cast includes Edmond's mother, several brothers,brothers-in-law and his grandmother, whose home allegedly washeadquarters for the enterprise and who has become a fixture onevening news shows with remarks as flamboyant as the trademark hatsshe wears.   Edmond borrowed techniques from Fortune 500 companies, accordingto prosecutors: He offered good pay _ $500 a week minimum _expensive cars, a company attorney, help in purchasing real estate,lavish trips and clothes and jewelry. There were all-expenses paidtrips to the Super Bowl and to heavyweight championship fights inLas Vegas. His payroll swelled once to 150 people.   He operated, the government says, the hottest drug market in thecity on two narrow tree-lined blocks in northeast Washington knownas ``The Strip.'' At peak hours, cars would be bumper-to-bumperwaiting for young street sellers to bring plastic bags of cocainefor $50 apiece.   The trial, which began Sept. 11, has become something of asensation in Washington, much like the Oliver North case thatunfolded two floors down earlier in the year and the John Hinckleytrial that took place two floors above.   Security was tight for those cases, but nothing like the Edmondtrial. The jurors are anonymous _ even to the judge and lawyers _and are identified only by number. Would-be spectators are helddown the hall and summoned one-by-one to go through metal detectors.   U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey declared in a memorandumthat there was a ``substantial likelihood of imminent danger to thesafety of the parties, witnesses, and other persons.'' Suspectingthe gang was trying to identify individual jurors, he tried toclose the trial to the public, leaving only reporters, but wasthwarted by an appeals court.   In court, Edmond and his 10 co-defendants are matched one-on-oneby U.S. marshals. Add to that a dozen defense lawyers, four or fivefor the government, the 12 jurors and three alternates, courtclerks and stenographer and the court takes on the appearance of aRoman Forum. There are too many lawyers to crowd at the bench forconferences; instead, they listen through wireless headphones.   The 11 are charged variously with cocaine distribution,conspiracy and racketeering. For Edmond, there is an additionalcharge punishable by life in prison without parole _ carrying on acontinuing criminal enterprise.   Edmond also is scheduled for trial, along with three otheralleged gang members, on three first-degree murder charges. Andthere will be a third proceeding for others charged withconspiracy, swelling the number of defendants to 24.   Despite the security precautions, Richey's court had to beemptied once because of a bomb threat. Remote-control video camerasscan the well of the court and the spectator seats. The judge oftenhas armed escorts from home to court.   The chief defense lawyer, William H. Murphy Jr., wranglesconstantly with the judge and the government's lead lawyer,Assistant U.S. Attorney Betty Ann Soiefer.   During a shouting match, Ms. Soiefer elbowed Murphy away fromthe lectern. He, in turn, likened her to football player William``the Refrigerator'' Perry and demanded an apology. The judge saidhe had not seen anything wrong with the prosecutor's conduct.   The trial began with six alternate jurors; it now has onlythree. One was dismissed earlier this month after it became clearhis identity had become known to defense attorneys, another becauseof family hardship and the third after she allegedly told otherjurors she believed all of the defendants are innocent.   There have been violent incidents. In March, prosecutors bymistake mailed a letter to the home of a key informant, detailingher cooperation and warning her life might be in danger. Thewitness was sharing her home with Edmond's brother, Emanuel Sutton,a defendant in the trial.   A week later, the informant, Deborah Y. Phillips, was shot inthe leg. A month later, she was found by her mother with her mouthtaped shut and suffering from an apparent drug overdose. Since thenshe has refused to testify, citing her rights againstself-incrimination.   In her grand jury testimony, she had described counting moneyfor the organization, paying salaries to the workers and preparingdrugs for street sale. She said she regularly turned over shoeboxesof money to Edmond, often as much as $60,000 a box.   The trial was three weeks old when a Molotov cocktail was throwninto the home of the mother of Kathy Sellers, a government witnesson the stand at that time. Nobody was hurt, but U.S. Attorney JayB. Stephens said all witnesses would be offered police protection.   Testimony has proved no less sensational than the theatricssurrounding the trial.   Ms. Sellers testified she once watched Constance Perry _Edmond's mother _ use a money-counting machine on thousands ofdollars at the home of one of Edmond's sisters. Both mother andsister are under indictment.   Drug agent John Cornille was surrounded on the stand by so manystacks of cocaine seized during the arrest of one defendant that hewas almost blocked from view.   Alta Rae Zanville told of visiting the apartment of defendantTony Lewis and finding so much money stacked on the floor that itdid not fit into three pieces of luggage. ``I would venture to sayit was about $3 million,'' she said.   Stevenson McArthur, a 20-year-old serving a prison term fordealing, testified he owned seven cars when he was 17.   He became acquainted with Edmond outside a convenience storewhen he asked about the black Mercedes-Benz that Edmond wasdriving. Asked how he knew the car was worth $80,000, McArthurreplied: ``I had one of my own.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 5</NOTE></DOC>
