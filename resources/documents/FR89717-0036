The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>Subsequent to our April 24, 1989, affirmative preliminary determination(54 FR 18562, May 1, 1989), the following events have occurred. In lettersdated May 22, 1989, the Department advised the respondents, Taiwan HsinSheng Industrial Co. (Hsin Sheng) and Kuang Fong Industrial Co., Ltd. (KuangFong), that we continued to find significant deficiencies in their submissions,and that we, therefore, would use the best information otherwise availablein accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 1677e(c), for purposesof our final determination. The petitioner requested a public hearing andsubmitted a case brief on May 19, 1989. On May 31, 1989, the Departmentheld a public hearing. No comments were submitted by Kuang Fong. Commentssubmitted by Hsin Sheng were untimely and were, therefore, returned pursuantto andSection; 353.38(a) of the Commerce Department regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 28, 1989 (54 FR 12742) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 353.38(a)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS) as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption onor after this date will be classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item numbers. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience andU.S. Customs Service purposes. Because the U.S. Customs Service advisedus that the HTS subheadings for these articles as set forth in our preliminarydetermination were incomplete, we have amended our listing to conform tothe HTS subheadings for these products as designated by the U.S. CustomsService. The ITC concurs with these changes. The written description remainsdispositive.The products covered by this investigation include the following articles:martial arts uniforms for men, boys, women, girls and infants. The uniformsconsist of tops, pants and belts and are imported from Taiwan separatelyor as ensembles. They are made of cotton or of man-made fibers, eitherornamented or not ornamented. They are suitable for wearing while practicingall forms of martial arts, including but not limited to: Judo, Karate,Kung Fu, Tae Kwon Do. Ninja, Ninjutsu, Hakama, Tai Chi, Jujitsu and Hapkido.The products covered by this investigation are currently provided for underthe following revised listing of HTS subheadings: 6203.22.1000, 6203.23.0060,6203.23.0090, 6203.29.2030, 6203.29.2060, 6204.22.1000, 6204.23.0040, 6204.23.0060,6204.29.2020, 6204.29.2050, 6203.42.4015, 6203.42.4045, 6203.43.4010, 6203.43.4020,6203.49.2010, 6203.49.2030, 6204.62.4020, 6204.62.4050, 6204.63.3510, 6204.63.3530,6204.69.2510, 6204.69.2530, 6209.20.3000, 6209.20.5035, 6209.20.5045, 6209.20.5050,6209.30.2000, 6209.30.3020, 6209.30.3030, 6209.30.3040, 6209.90.2000, 6209.90.3020,6209.90.3030, 6209.90.3040, 6211.32.0060, 6211.32.0080, 6211.33.0040, 6211.33.0060,6211.42.0050, 6211.42.0080, 6211.43.0060, 6211.43.0090, 6217.10.0010, and6217.10.0030.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The period of investigation (POI) was June 1, 1988, through November 30,1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of martial arts uniforms from Taiwan to theUnited States were made at less than fair value, we compared the UnitedStates price to the foreign market value. Because the respondents failedto provide adequate responses to the Department's questionnaire, we usedthe best information otherwise available for determining the estimateddumping margins in this determination pursuant to section 776(c) of theAct, 19 U.S.C. 1677e(c). In this case, the best information otherwise availablewas the information contained in the petition.As detailed below, substantial omissions and deficiencies in both respondents'responses precluded any reasonable price-to-price comparisons. Neitherrespondent provided an adequate product concordance, nor any cost informationpertaining to adjustments for differences in merchandise. Furthermore,Hsin Sheng did not provide warranty or guarantee expenses, although itadmitted shipping ``free goods'' to replace defective goods. In addition,Hsin Sheng's credit expenses were reported incorrectly. Kuang Fong failedto provide credit expenses and packing costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>United States price was based on the United States price information providedin the petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>Foreign market value was based on home market prices provided in the petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>Because of the substantial omissions and deficiencies contained in bothrespondents' responses, verification was not conducted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG>Comment 1Petitioner alleges that the Department's final determination should bebased on a dumping margin higher than the 8.50 percent best informationavailable rate used in the preliminary determination. Petitioner arguesthat:1. The period of investigation did not address the time when the most seriousdumping occurred;2. Department statistics indicated that the actual export prices to theU.S. of products covered by TSUSA item numbers 384.5000 and 381.6300 werelower than the estimates in the petition; and3. The third country selling price and the constructed value approachesyielded dumping margins greater than the 8.50 percent used in the preliminarydetermination.DOC PositionWe have determined that it is appropriate to continue using the 8.50 percentrate used for the preliminary determination as the best information otherwiseavailable for the final determination. This rate is the one petitionerused in its petition as the basis for its less than fair value allegation.With respect to petitioner's first point, the Department followed its normalpractice of using a six-month POI which ended with the month in which thepetition was filed. This definition of the POI is in accordance with andSection;353.42(b)(1) of the Department's regulations. The fact that more significantless than fair value sales may have occurred one or two years earlier isnot relevant to our investigation because we base our determinations oncurrent data. Therefore, since no evidence was presented indicating thatthe POI was unrepresentative due to a lack of sales activity, we have followedour normal practice.With respect to petitioner's second point, we do not consider it appropriateto base the BIA dumping margin on the Department's statistics. Our positionis based on the fact that the statistics on which petitioner relies arederived in part from entry documents submitted by importers to the U.S.Customs Service. In this case the petitioner has made certain allegationsthat Hsin Sheng has not accurately reported the prices of its goods oninvoices which were filed with the U.S. Customs Service for duty assessmentpurposes. Hsin Sheng has also indicated to the Department that prices itlists on invoices, which are submitted to the U.S. Customs Service, maydiffer from the actual prices charged for such merchandise. This matterhas been referred to the U.S. Customs Service for appropriate action. Becausethe U.S. Customs data are aggregated by product category, questionabledata from one exporter throws into question the aggregate product statisticscompiled by U.S. Customs. Under these circumstances, the Department doesnot find that this alternative presents us with the best information availableupon which to make margin calculations.Finally, with respect to petitioner's third point, we did not use thesealternative approaches in view of our preference for the use of home marketprices in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)(1)and andSection; 353.46 of the Department's regulations. Accordingly, we havebased our BIA rate on the estimate of the home market price given in thepetition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of martial arts uniforms from Taiwan that are entered orwithdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The U.S. Customs Service shall continue to requirea cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by whichthe foreign market value of martial arts uniforms from Taiwan exceeds theUnited States price as shown below. This suspension of liquidation willremain in effect until further notice. The margins are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,12</C> <H1>Manufacturer/producer/exporter</H1><H1>Margin percentage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Hsin Sheng<D>8.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kuang Fong<D>8.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All Others<D>8.50</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 1673d(d), we havenotified the ITC of our determination. In addition, pursuant to section735(c)(1) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 1673d(c)(1), we are making available tothe ITC all nonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to thisinvestigation. We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and businessproprietary information in our files, provided the ITC confirms that itwill not disclose such information, either publicly or under administrativeprotective order, without the written consent of the Assistant Secretaryfor Import Administration.If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury,does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated and all securities postedas a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled.However, if the ITC determines that material injury does exist, the Departmentwill issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officials to assessantidumping duties on martial arts uniforms from Taiwan entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption, on or after the effective date of thesuspension of liquidation, equal to the amount by which the foreign marketvalue exceeds the United States price.This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act,19 U.S.C. 1673d(d).<ITAG tagnum="34">July 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric I.
