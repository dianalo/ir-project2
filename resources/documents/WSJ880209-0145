Dunwoody, stepped down because of &quot;philosophical differences&quot; over the future direction of the thrift.    Mid-State said Charles E. Harris, 41-year-old chairman, will assume the additional positions of president and chief executive on an interim basis.    A spokesman declined to elaborate on the differences between Mr. Dunwoody and the board. Mr. Dunwoody, 54, had been president and chief executive since 1978. He couldn't be reached for comment.    For its first quarter ended Dec. 31, Mid-State earned $440,200, or 22 cents a share, down sharply from $904,900, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.    Mid-State shares closed yesterday at $19.75, up $1.50, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
