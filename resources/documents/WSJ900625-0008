Helionetics Chairman Bernard B. Katz said the venture,Shenyang Shenlong Computer Systems Co., would be financedwith equal contributions of $600,000 in cash and equipmentfrom Helionetics and from Northern Computer ApplicationDevelopment Co., a technology concern sponsored by theChinese government.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Katz said that Helionetics was attracted to Chinabecause of the relatively inexpensive scientific talentthere. &quot;Physics is physics the world over, and price is thebig factor&quot; in selling computers, he said.   After riding the wave of the defense-industry buildup inthe early 1980s, Helionetics' large debt load forced it toseek bankruptcy-law protection in 1986. Now the company ispinning its hopes on its computer business.   Under terms of the agreement, Helionetics said itsrecently acquired Definicon International Corp. unit willsell to the joint-venture certain advanced technology boardsthat are about to enter production. Helionetics hasn't yetreceived an export license from the U.S. Department ofCommerce to sell the boards, a Helionetics spokesman said.   Mr. Katz said Helionetics has approval to export a lessadvanced board. These, or the more advanced board ifgovernment approval is granted, will be installed in personalcomputers made by the new company. The computers would besold mainly in China, as well as in the U.S. and Europe, forscientific and engineering applications, Mr. Katz said.</TEXT></DOC>
