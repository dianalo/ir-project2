North'sconfrontational testimony before Congress last year are for sale atthe Republican National Convention, but the indicted former WhiteHouse aide is not here in the flesh.   Neither are former national security adviser John Poindexter,former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, ex-White House aideMichael K. Deaver nor a host of other one-time Reaganadministration officials whose ethical conduct was questioned.   An exception is Lyn Nofziger, Reagan's former political directorwho was convicted of illegally lobbying the executive branch.Nofziger said he planned to help former Education Secretary WilliamBennett with his convention speech.   This is Vice President George Bush's convention, and thesoon-to-be GOP presidential nominee obviously wants to distancehimself from what critics have called the administration's ``sleazefactor.''   ``He is an honest, open, ethical person who has high standardsfor himself and the people around him,'' said Iowa Gov. TerryBranstad.   Another Midwesterner, Gov. Michael Hayden of Kansas said Bushcan insulate himself from ethical criticism by building a ``wall ofcredibility'' around himself. As a first step, Hayden said Bushmust select aides and associates whose behavior is beyond reproach.   Bush has stressed his openness by releasing financial data,including his tax returns and a statement from his doctor about hismedical condition.   The vice president also suggested that Meese's conduct did notmeet the standards he would set for his Cabinet members, though henever called for Meese's resignation. Meese, who left office lastFriday, said he strongly supports Bush's nomination, but planned totake a vacation with his family this week.   Independent counsel James McKay investigated Meese's conductwhile in office. McKay said he would not bring charges againstMeese, although Meese probably violated conflict-of-interest andtax laws. Meese denied any wrongdoing, and compared his case tothat of former Labor Secretary Ray Donovan who was acquitted onfraud charges.   The Republicans have touched briefly on ethics in theirplatform, focusing exclusively on activities of theDemocrat-controlled Congress, primarily the House.   In Congress, ``outright offenses against ethical standards andpublic laws are treated lightly,'' and members ``protect theircronies charged with personal misconduct or criminal activities,''the document says.   While more than a dozen Reagan administration officials haveleft under a cloud, Indiana Gov. Robert Orr doubted the Democratswould make a big deal about the issue during the 1988 presidentialcampaign. ``It's a bum issue for the Democrats to pursue; theycould find themselves hoist by their own petards,'' he said.   In the House, Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, is the subject of aninvestigation by the ethics committee. The panel has hired anindependent counsel to look into large royalties Wright receivedfrom a book published by a campaign contributor.   ``There is sleaze on both sides,'' said Clopha Deshotel of theAmerican Freedom Coalition, a conservative lobbying group that isselling the Oliver North videotapes for $25, along with pictures ofNorth for $5 and bumper stickers that say ``Pardon Ollie'' and``Two Wrongs Make A Wright.''   North and his ex-boss, John Poindexter, are awaiting trial oncharges of conspiracy to defraud the United States for their rolein the Iran-Contra affair. North also is charged with acceptinggratuities and destroying documents.   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, has hit the lecturecircuit, receiving as much as $25,000 a speech. He also hascampaigned for Republican candidates in California and Florida.   But Republican officials say they have no word that North willappear at the convention. Said Deshotel: ``It would be like Elvis;he would upstage the event.''   The allegations against administration officials vary widely.Deaver, the former deputy chief of staff, was convicted of perjuryin an ethics investigation.   Others convicted were Rita Lavelle, former head of theEnvironmental Protection Agency's toxic waste clean-up program whowas found guilty of lying to Congress; Paul Thayer, a deputysecretary of defense who served 19 months for lying about insiderstock trading, and C. McClain Haddow, a top official at Health andHuman Services who pleaded guilty to pocketing $55,330 from anon-profit foundation he started.   Others who ran into trouble were Richard V. Allen, a formernational security adviser who resigned amid questions about hisacceptance of gifts from the Japanese; Anne Gorsuch Burford, aformer EPA administrator who resigned amid allegations of agencymismanagement and possible conflict of interest, and J. Lynn Helms,former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration whoresigned after reports that he was involved in questionablebusiness dealings.</TEXT></DOC>
