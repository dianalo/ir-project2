But analysts said the product's commercial potential isn't yet clear.    The company, the world's second-biggest insulin maker, said its new insulin preparation appears to work three times faster than existing insulin products. Clinical trials to test the product's effectiveness and safety are under way, but they may take five years to complete, Novo said.    In a statement, Novo touted the product as &quot;potentially . . . the most significant breakthrough in insulin research&quot; since scientists identified the hormone in 1921. Novo officials said its researchers used a novel technology to develop the product. The company plans to apply this technology in designing other drugs and industrial enzymes, according to Ulrik Lassen, Novo's chief science officer.    Existing insulin preparations, sometimes made through genetic engineering, contain naturally occurring human, pork, or bovine insulin molecules. By contrast, the new Novo insulin has an artificial molecular structure designed entirely by computer, giving it the specific, fast-acting qualities desired, Mr. Lassen said.    Other biotechnological companies world-wide are working with such computerized chemistry sets. But Novo claims its new insulin is the first product to emerge from the sets' use. Like some existing insulins, the new product also is manufactured with genetic engineering.    Novo disclosed its advance at an Indianapolis meeting of the American Diabetes Association yesterday. Experts reacted cautiously to the development. </TEXT></DOC>
