Because earlierdetection would allow institution of curative therapy, the search forimaging modalities capable of detecting intraprostatic lesions and delineatinglocal extension has been extensive. This review focuses both on currentimaging methods and on those likely to be useful in the future for thediagnosis and pelvic staging of prostatic cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
