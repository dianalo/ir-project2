The bonding mechanisms involvedin the acceptor neutralization process at grain boundaries are examinedusing microanalytical techniques. Differences in the incorporation ofmolecular and atomic hydrogen, and corresponding variations in electricalpassivation at grain boundaries, are observed. Low-temperature Augerdifference spectroscopy confirms Si--H bonding to dominate B, Ga, andIn-doped cases, with no direct acceptor--hydrogen bonding. Al-rich grainboundaries show H-complex and hydroxyl bonding. The data confirm chemicalbond strength trends with Bandless;Gaandless;In. Volume-indexed Auger electron spectroscopyis utilized to compare bonding and H distributions in B- and Al-richgrain boundary regions.</TEXT></DOC>
