Results were well below prior estimates of marketanalysts. And while BP's declaration of an unchangedquarterly dividend of 4.20 pence a share wasn't the dividendcut many investors had expected for months, it was stingierthan most analysts had been predicting recently.   London financial markets had been rife with rumors, deniedby BP Chairman Robert Horton, of a board split over theamount of dividend. The speculation was that Mr. Hortonfavored maintaining BP's policy of steady dividend growth,while other directors demanded a dividend cuts.   The unchanged final payout left BP's full-year dividend 5%higher at 16.80 pence a share, compared with 16.05 pence in1990.   BP said North Sea crude oil prices averaged $19.97 abarrel in 1991, compared with $23.73 a barrel in 1990. Thecomparison between quarters was even worse. Prices averaged$20.52 a barrel in the recent quarter, compared with $32.63in the last quarter of 1990.   BP said prices fell steadily during the recent quarterbecause of worries about oversupply by the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries.   &quot;World oil prices appear likely to remain weak in theshort term. This is because of concerns over continuing highOPEC production levels with the overhang of prospectiveproduction from Kuwait and Iraq, coupled with the milder thanexpected northern winter and anticipation of the usualseasonally weaker demand in the second quarter.&quot;   BP said the expected continuation of weak oil prices andrecession means that market conditions for the first half of1992 &quot;are likely to be broadly similar to those for theprevious six months.&quot;   BP called the current combination of low oil prices andeconomic downturn &quot;unprecedented.&quot; It said it was taking&quot;resolute action&quot; to hold down costs and improveprofitability.   As with other oil companies, BP's petrochemical divisionhas performed poorly, as new plants started in the late 1980shave come on line just in time to greet the recession.   BP's chemical division sustained a loss of #49 million ona replacement cost basis in the fourth quarter compared witha #7 million profit the year earlier. For all of 1991, thechemical business registered a #7 million loss, swinging froma profit of #129 million in 1990. BP said, &quot;chemical resultsare expected to remain poor through 1992.&quot;   Refining and marketing replacement profit fell 10% to #104million in the fourth quarter from #115 million the yearbefore.   Per-share earnings fell 99% in the recent quarter to 0.1pence from 8.5 pence and fell 75% to 7.7 pence for the fullyear from 31.3 pence.</TEXT></DOC>
