He is an ``arenero,'' a sand-digger, and ekes out a meagerexistence supplying sand for construction sites in San Salvador,the capital 10 miles to the south.   Manuel de Jesus spends his time pulling an iron-wheeled wagonloaded with 800 pounds of bananas from the eastern bus terminal toSan Salvador's central market.   Neither has anything to show for his work except the sinewymuscle of his arms and back. What they earn with their toil is notso much a living as another day's survival.   The hard life is harder for the poor in El Salvador.   Though there is no official parameter such as a ``povertyline,'' it is clear that the great majority of El Salvador's 5.5million people are poor.   The U.S. Agency for International Development says 27 percent ofchildren under 5 are malnourished. Infant mortality is 91 per 1,000live births, the highest rate in Central America.   Half the population lacks safe drinking water, and the leadingcause of death is intestinal infection, according to the Ministryof Health. Only four out of 10 people can read and write.   ``With this you make enough to eat, that's it,'' says thegrizzled Ayala, 55, pausing to lean on his shovel. He and his wifereared seven children in a two-room adobe house. Three of the sixboys became sand-diggers.   Ayala rises every day, including Sunday, at 3 a.m. so as to beat the river by 4. The first trucks arrive at dawn, by which timeAyala has shoveled a ton of sand.   On a good day he'll dig three or four one-ton truckloads andmake 15 to 20 colones ($3 to $4). With that his wife will buy rice,beans, tortillas, perhaps a few eggs and some cheese _ enough forthe couple and their one remaining dependent child.   ``You can't save a colon,'' he says. ``The few cents you setaside go up in smoke with an illness, something like that.''   He says he feels strong and plans on working at least five moreyears. He'll depend on help from his sons when he can no longerwork.   Ramon Aristedes Najarro, who digs about 50 yards downriver fromAyala, is 48 years old and feels his strength draining. He doesn'teven want to think about how he'll get by when his back gives out.   ``I'll just have to find something else. Selling newspapers, ormaybe I'll have to beg.''   At the San Salvador's central market, Manuel de Jesus takes abreak with three other ``carretoneros,'' or cart-pullers, seated ontheir sturdy wagons. A sweet, slightly nauseating odor wafts acrossthe narrow street from a pile of rotten or mashed bananas.   A middle-aged woman searches through the pile for still ediblefruit.   The cart-pullers, like the sand-diggers, make about $3 on anaverage day. De Jesus, 28, and Granadeno Perez, 29, sleep in anearby flophouse that charges $2 a night for a piece of cardboardon the floor and water for bathing. That leaves them a dollar forfood _ and for booze.   ``Sometimes we go without eating to buy guaro,'' says Perez,already in a semi-stupor from the cane liquor by 10 a.m. All fourcart-pullers readily admitted they try to maintain a constantalcoholic haze.   Several times a day they come up with the five colones to buy ahalf-liter of Muneco, the cheapest guaro.   ``It's very hard, this life,'' said de Jesus. ``There's nofuture in it. It damages your body. The only thing you're left withare the knocks.'' He motioned to Perez's bandaged hand, sprainedfrom the strain of hauling.   Asked his feelings about leftist guerrillas who say they arefighting for the poor, Ayala said: ``I understand nothing ofpolitics. But some say they (the guerrillas) would make thisanother Nicaragua. I don't want that.''   None of the sand-diggers or cart-pullers interviewed could readand none has ever voted. Democracy, which returned to El Salvadorin 1982 after decades of military rule, means little to them.   ``Democracy has done nothing,'' says Najarro. ``It hasn'tcreated jobs. You look out for yourself and get by as best youcan.''   ``I doubt the country can progress,'' says Ayala. ``I don't havefaith.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, Sept. 21</NOTE></DOC>
