The American Gas Association says the government is not countingall the different potential reservoirs, and the American PetroleumInstitute says the new numbers for oil are just another in a longline of underestimates.   Terry Uhl, the gas association's spokesman, calls it``misinformation and disinformation'' to say onshore undiscoveredreserves amount to 254 trillion cubic feet, down from 427 trillioncubic feet.   The association uses the estimate of 400 trillion cubic feetfrom the Potential Gas Committee, an industry panel operated by theColorado School of Mines.   Ozzie Girard, the geological survey's deputy assistant directorfor engineering geology, said Thursday he doubted there was muchdifference between the survey and the gas committee estimates onceadjustments for comparability are made.   The survey has not counted gas in certain shales, tight sands orreservoirs of less than 5 billion cubic feet, all of which arecounted by the committee. Hard-to-exploit tight sands formationsprobably hold 100 trillion cubic feet, Girard said.   No such adjustments can account for the change in estimates ofundiscovered onshore oil.   The survey said undiscovered oil likely is between 19.6 billionbarrels and 51.9 billion barrels, with the best estimate at 33.4billion barrels. The range in 1981 was 41.7 billion barrels to 71billion barrels, with the best estimate at 54.6 billion barrels.   In 1981, the survey relied heavily on the judgment of expertgeologists. In the last two reports, the survey has been able touse detailed drilling data from the entire country, Girard said.   Charles DiBona, president of the petroleum institute, said thenation has produced three times the oil estimated by a presidentialcommission in 1952 in the category of oil remaining to bediscovered.   ``You never know until you drill,'' DiBona said.   Most of the change, Girard said, resulted from drillingdisappointments. In 1981, there had been major new finds in theoverthrust belt east of the Rockies, and government geologiststhought ``the sky was the limit.'' But drilling failures since thenhave reduced expectations.   Also, some pools of oil have moved from the ``undiscovered'' tothe ``discovered'' category.   Also, the price has fallen sharply. The 1981 study used $30 abarrel. The new study assumes a price of $18 a barrel. ``Certainlythere was some effect'' from the lower price, said Girard, but hecould not quantify it.   This could mean lower estimates for offshore oil, which theMinerals Management Service, sister agency in the InteriorDepartment to the Geological Survey, estimated in 1985 at 12.2billion barrels, down from 27 billion barrels in 1981.   Tom DeRocco, spokesman for the service, said new offshoreestimates expected next month were made on the assumption that oilcosts $18 a barrel. The 1985 estimates assumed $29 a barrel.   He declined to say what the new estimates would be, but did say,``There's no question economics has a lot to do with this.''   A higher price for oil makes pools with more expensiveproduction costs profitable to drill.</TEXT></DOC>
