If the FDIC were to boost the premium beyond the current23 cents for each $100 of domestic deposits, banks would bepaying a higher rate than savings and loan associationscurrently pay. Bankers contend this would put them at acompetitive disadvantage. They also argue that a new premiumincrease would boost their costs and reduce profitability ata time when the Bush administration wants them to make moreloans. The premium rose to 23 cents from 19.5 cents July 1.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Riegle said that a premium increase is necessaryto bolster the shrinking bank insurance fund. In a statement,the Michigan Democrat said the agency &quot;may face a choice:Either raise more money from the banking industry now, orraise more money from the taxpayers later.&quot; Taxpayerscurrently are paying to insure Sandamp;L deposits, but the BankDeposit Insurance Fund is entirely supported by premiumsbanks pay on deposits. Many banks pass the premiums on tocustomers in the form of higher fees.   Mr. Riegle called for a premium increase after departingFDIC Chairman William Seidman told him that the bank depositinsurance fund &quot;currently has a net worth of $2.4 billion andcontinues to decline.&quot; Mr. Seidman, whose term endedyesterday, urged Congress to quickly pass a plan to expandthe FDIC's borrowing authority by $70 billion. Without theaugmented borrowing power, the FDIC may have to postpone theclosing or sale of failed banks, Mr. Seidman warned.   The borrowing authority is contained in sweepinglegislation to restructure the banking industry. Both theHouse and the Senate are expected to start debating versionsof the complex proposal within the next few weeks. Today,President Bush plans to meet with a broad spectrum of bankingleaders to urge passage of the legislation. Aides say he'llpromote the bill as a way to encourage more bank lending tospur the economy.   But the president may hear grousing about another increasein premiums, which have nearly doubled since Dec. 31. Eachone-cent increase in the premium costs the banking industryabout $250 million a year, said Bert Ely, a bankingconsultant. Many congressional Democrats want higher premiumsto help rebuild the deposit insurance fund and to pay backadditional loans from the Treasury. But Mr. Ely warned thatwith bank profits low, lending subdued and the economy weak,&quot;there's a conflict between what's good politics and what'sgood economics.&quot;   But pressure for a premium increase is likely to grow. Mr.Seidman has long contended that the $70 billion in newborrowing authority should be enough to enable the BankInsurance Fund to meet its needs if the economy recovers. Butin a letter to Mr. Riegle, Mr. Seidman took a morepessimistic stand. &quot;The uncertainty of the timing and thestrength of economic recovery could bring the sufficiency ofthe proposed recapitalization into question,&quot; he conceded. Hesaid the FDIC is currently reviewing the future demands onthe fund in light of the slow recovery.   With Mr. Seidman's departure, his expected successor,William Taylor, a Federal Reserve Board official, will haveto face the premium increase decision.</TEXT></DOC>
