(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Mary Hart was growing up in SiouxFalls, S.D., her mother often worried about the future``Entertainment Tonight'' host running away to become a showgirl.   Well, Mom, don't look now, but ...   The perky blonde, who taught high school English and piano whiledoing community theater and dreaming of a show business career,recently made her stage debut in Las Vegas.   With more bookings here and in Atlantic City, plus summer stockand music festivals this summer, Hart's ready to continue her dualprofessional role, although she'd just as soon skip those 18-hourdays, juggling two careers in two cities.   Her grueling daily grind _ shuttling between this city's GlitterGulch for her long-awaited fling at singing and dancing, then backto a Hollywood ``ET'' set for more TV patter _ gave new meaning tothe concept of commuting to work.   Hart realized a lifelong dream when she spent two weeksappearing with comedian David Brenner at the Golden Nugget Hoteland Casino earlier this month.   But she admits she wouldn't care for a steady diet of the doubleduty.   ``I performed at 8 and again at 11,'' she said. ``Then I caughta 1 a.m. flight to Los Angeles, and hit the house about 2:45. I gotup at 7:30 and was at Paramount (where `ET' is filmed) by 8 a.m. Wedid our promos and other spots, then began taping the show at 11:30a.m. At 2:45 in the afternoon I was on a flight back to Vegas.   ``Both worlds is not an ideal situation,'' she laughed as sherelaxed between shows during her two-week engagement. ``It'sconceivable to do one show a night and commute for a short periodof time.''   In her show, Hart does several dance numbers and displays asurprisingly good singing voice. Her appearance and style arereminiscent of Ann-Margret when she was a Las Vegas headliner foryears.   Hart's sexy legs _ insured by Lloyd's of London for $2 million _are amply displayed in the Las Vegas show. The legs are a productof a lot of hard work, including a treadmill, rowing machine andExercycle at home, 25 miles of speed-walking a week, and aerobicsand dance classes.   She admits that coming into this town with a nationally knownname didn't hurt her chances for success. But she thinks she had tohave more than just a pretty, recognizable face _ and $2 millionlegs.   ``You know, you're putting it all on the line when you come inhere as a co-headliner,'' she said. ``There's no way of hiding it.But I wanted to do it. I was both exhilarated and intimidated bythe experience.''   Her song-and-dance debut has given her a new appreciation of thepeople she covers on `ET.'   ``There's a lot of rejection and hard knocks. I'm far moreappreciative for having experienced it firsthand.''   Hart admits to something of a Walter Mitty lifestyle since herdays in South Dakota. She's been a finalist in the Miss AmericaPageant (1971), been a host of ``ET'' for five years, sparred withDavid Letterman, sung the National Anthem at Los Angeles Dodgersgames, ridden with the Blue Angels flight team, danced on the Emmyawards show, injured one leg in a fall from the high wire on a``Circus of the Stars'' performance and been co-host of theTournament of Roses Parade coverage and the ``Regis Philbin Show.''   Despite all those credits she thinks her stage debut at theGolden Nugget was one of her toughest gigs.   ``I prepared for the opening for months,'' she recalled. ``Thenthe day of the opening, after working all afternoon in dressrehearsals, I almost felt like I couldn't do it. I proceeded to cryfor three hours.   ``Part of it was sheer fear; part of it was excitement. Therewere moments of being panic-stricken. But the overriding emotionwas one of exhilaration.   ``I have really always seen myself as an entertainer,'' shesaid. ``You dream those things, but you don't know for sure ifthey'll ever happen. I think that was part of my emotionalism,realizing those things had come true.''   A few dreams _ a Broadway play and her own TV sitcom _ remainunfulfilled. But, at age 35, she thinks time is on her side.   She's learned to roll with the punches, to be patient.   After doing radio and TV talk shows in Sioux Falls, CedarRapids, Iowa, and Oklahoma City, she moved West to headline ``PMMagazine.'' She left that show to co-host ``Regis Philbin'' _ whichfolded four months later.   ``I was out of work and out of money,'' she recalled. ``That wasa time I was terribly disappointed. Then ET came along. Thankheaven for my Midwestern upbringing, and positive thinking.   ``My parents always told me that the bad times accentuate thegood. I've always translated the negative experiences into good inthe long run. I'm a big believer that life goes on. You get backfrom life what you put into it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
