Britain ordered the Kuwait Investment Office on Tuesday toreduce its 21.68 percent stake in British Petroleum to 9.9 percentwithin a year, saying the holding threatened the interests of theBritian public.   British financial analysts said the investment office, which isowned by the Kuwaiti government, could lose hundreds of millions ofdollars.   The Kuwaiti government, which said Tuesday that it was``extremely dissatisfied'' with the ruling, withheld furthercomment as officials considered the implications of the order.   But the thrust of opinion in economic circles was that Britainshould be dropped as investment market.   Oil-rich Kuwait has an estimated $85 billion invested abroad,mainly in the United States, Britain, France, West Germany andother Western European countries.   Recent investments have been made in Asia, including China,through the Kuwait Investment Office, which is based in London.   The state-run radio and television network ignored the Britishdecision in news broadcasts, although pro-government newspaperspublished the report on their inside economic pages.   The state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp., which owns the stake inBritish Petroleum, declined comment. So did the office of Kuwait'soil minister, Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah.   In London, Michael Walter, a lawyer with the law firm StephensonHarwood, which is representing the Kuwait Investment Office, said:``We haven't decided what we are going to do, nor have we ruled outany possible course of action.''   ``One of the things I am looking at is whether the commission'sfinding is open to (a court) challenge,'' he said.   The Kuwait Investment Office announced last Nov. 18 that it hadpurchased 10 percent of British Petroleum's shares. The holding wasgradually increased to 21.68 percent after the British governmentput its remaining one-third stake in the oil company up for sale onthe stock market.   The British Mergers and Monpolies Commission said Tuesday thatKuwait's holding in British Petroleum ``may be expected to operateagainst the public interest'' and recommended it be cut.   Lord Young, Britain's trade secretary, accepted the findings andtold the Kuwait Investment Office to reduce the British Petroleumstake.   Leading Kuwaiti economists and investment decision-makersstrongly criticized the British move, labeling it ``unjustifiable''and ``a mistake.''   ``It's the worst reaction on the part of a country that promotesa free market economy and deals a blow to this ideology, especiallyas the decision is taken when a Conservative government, whichsupports the policy of privatization and capitalization, is inoffice,'' said Jassim al-Saadoun, chairman of the Shell EconomicConsultancy Bureau.   ``It's an unjust decision and impairs economic freedom,'' hesaid.   Al-Saadoun predicted Kuwait would respond by reducing itsinvestment in Britain or by asking the British government to buypart of Kuwait's holding or extend the 12-month deadline.   Ziad Taqi, head of the economic department at the National Bankof Kuwait said, ``It's a bad and annoying decision which has anadverse impact on the local market.''   If Britain wanted to remain a free market economy that attractsboth private and government institutions ``it should not have dealtsuch a blow to Kuwait,'' he said.   Taqi said the British government should have stepped in earlierto express its opposition since Kuwait gradually built up theBritish Petroleum stake.   ``I think the British decision will prompt the (Kuwaiti)government to reconsider its investment in Britain,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
