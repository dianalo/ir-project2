The suit, filed in British Columbia Supreme Court, charges that Softsave made copies of the companies' software programs, which they allege is a violation of copyright law.    According to the suit, Softsave operates a software preview club through which members can preview software programs for $10. Following a 21-day trial period, the members are asked to either buy the programs or destroy the disks. The suit said the sample disks are unauthorized copies of the original programs.    In their court filings, the plaintiffs say &quot;they are the owners of copyrights in Canada in certain literary works, namely computer software programs contained in both written form and on magnetic storage devices.&quot; Courts in the British Commonwealth have issued different interpretations of the applicability of copyright to computer programs.    Robert MacFarlane, a Toronto lawyer retained by Softsave, said the company plans to defend itself &quot;on the basis that there is no copyright on computer programs in Canada.&quot; Unlike the U.S., he said, Canada hasn't amended its copyright law to specifically include computer programs. He said he doesn't expect to dispute the U.S. companies' contention that the programs were copied.    Lotus, Cambridge, Mass., and other large software companies have filed a number of suits in recent years to combat illegal duplication of their software. Plaintiffs in the suit also include Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.; Ashton-Tate, Torrance, Calif.; Activision Inc., Mountain View, Calif.; Lifetree Software Co., Monterey, Calif.; Broderbund Software Inc., San Rafael, Calif.; and Infocom Inc., Cambridge, Mass. </TEXT></DOC>
