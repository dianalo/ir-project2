Mr. Bradley also faces problems as federal investigators continue to probe his financial relationship with former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond chief Michael Milken. In addition, Mr. Hahn referred his findings to the Los Angeles County district attorney, the state attorney general, the state Fair Political Practices Commission and the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.    No criminal charges were filed as a result of Mr. Hahn's investigation. Nevertheless, Mr. Hahn attacked the mayor's conduct. &quot;Just because we found no violation of law does not mean that what the mayor did was right,&quot; he said.    In a 45-minute televised address, Mr. Bradley responded point by point to the report. &quot;When all is said and done, the inquiry confirms what I have said all along. I did not engage in conflicts of interest. I did not violate the public's trust.&quot; As for the alleged violations in reporting his investments, Mr. Bradley said, &quot;The errors I made were not deliberate. They show only that I'm not an accountant, and I shouldn't have tried to be one. These were technical violations of a civil nature -- nothing more.&quot;    In the introduction to his 691-page report, Mr. Hahn said his investigation was limited to conflict-of-interest questions and &quot;did not intrude into the exclusive province of other authorities,&quot; specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Hahn gave information about the 71-year-old mayor's stock transactions to the SEC in May.    Mr. Hahn's six-count suit alleges that the mayor &quot;intentionally or negligently&quot; violated disclosure requirements under the state's Political Reform Act. In early August, Mr. Bradley filed amended financial interest statements with the Los Angeles city clerk and the Fair Political Practices Commission, which showed discrepancies with earlier filings.    The investments that Mr. Hahn alleges were improperly reported include: as much as $100,000 of Metromedia Inc. bonds purchased Dec. 31, 1984, and disposed of March 7, 1986; as much as $10,000 of L.A. Gear Inc. common stock bought and sold July 1, 1986; more than $100,000 of Cadence Design Systems Inc. common stock, purchased Dec. 14, 1988; more than $100,000 of common stock of CVN Cos., purchased Sept. 9, 1988, and sold Dec. 19, 1988; as much as $10,000 in interest from a &quot;federally unregistered&quot; Gibraltar Financial Corp. bond; and as much as $100,000 in a bond of Trans World Airlines, acquired March 8, 1988.    Mr. Hahn wouldn't give the amount of fines Mr. Bradley faces under the suit although it reportedly could total more than $2 million.    About half of Mr. Hahn's report is devoted to the city's dealings with Far East National Bank, a Chinatown bank that paid the mayor $18,000 to serve as a consultant last year. Mr. Bradley returned the money as reports of a potential conflict of interest began surfacing in March.    In interviews with city attorney investigators, Far East's president, Henry Hwang, said he hired Mr. Bradley as a paid consultant, with the title of &quot;foreign adviser,&quot; because he hoped the mayor could &quot;open some doors for us with some . . . major corporation: People that he might know that we are not able to get because we're a very, very small bank.&quot; When asked later what the mayor was able to do for Far East, Mr. Hwang responded: &quot;Frankly, not much.&quot;    The report said that on March 22, after a conversation with the mayor, the city's treasurer made two $1 million deposits with Far East without any competitive bids from other financial institutions, contrary to treasurer office policy. The report contends that a bid sheet was doctored with &quot;white out&quot; correction fluid to cover a reference that the Far East transaction was &quot;per the mayor.&quot; Written over the correction were the words &quot;per Leonard Rittenberg,&quot; the city treasurer.    Mr. Hahn said that &quot;there is no question in my mind of a cover-up&quot; at the treasurer's office but that there is no evidence that any such cover-up was related to or orchestrated by the mayor.    The report also showed that the city treasurer had placed sizable deposits in Gibraltar Savings andamp; Loan in 1986 and 1987, reaching $320 million in 1986. In that same year, Mr. Bradley bought more than $100,000 of bonds of the thrift's parent, Beverly Hills-based Gibraltar Financial Corp. But the city attorney concluded that there was no evidence Mr. Bradley directed the deposit of city funds in Gibraltar, whose operations were taken over earlier this year by federal thrift regulators.    Nor did the city attorney find any impropriety in Mr. Bradley's service as a paid director of Valley Federal Savings andamp; Loan -- a post he resigned in April -- or in his ties to a task force whose director, Juanita St. John, faces criminal charges for failing to account for $180,000 in city funds allocated to the group. Ms. St. John has been a business partner of Mr. Bradley.    The report gave details of several instances where Drexel had dealings with the city, including a 1985 meeting where Mr. Milken made a presentation on the &quot;positive aspects of the high-yield bond market&quot; to the police and fire pension commissioners. But the city attorney concluded that although the mayor had used Drexel as brokers in his personal investments and had made limited partnership investments through Drexel, there wasn't any evidence that the mayor tried to influence any public agencies to do business with the firm. </TEXT></DOC>
