Many of the 6.6 million to 7 million people who were born between1917 and 1921 _ the so-called ``notch babies'' _ think otherwise.They have been complaining to their lobbyists and members ofCongress for several years that they are being robbed of part oftheir monthly Social Security checks.   But even if there were merit to solving the problem, ``doing somay not be a prudent course of action at this time,'' Joseph F.Delfico, senior associate director of GAO, told the Senate FinanceSocial Security subcommittee Monday.   He cited the competing needs ``to reduce deficits, meet otherpressing national needs and maintain the Social Security system on apath toward financial health.''   The problem was created in 1977, when Congress cut back agenerous cost-of-living-allowance formula enacted in 1972. The newformula was phased in and affected those born from 1917 through 1921.   As a result, some retirees born a year or two before 1917 can getabout $100 more a month in pensions than can a person under similarcircumstances who was born during the notch period. The differencein benefits for those two groups is called the notch.   ``We are concerned that you and your colleagues haveunderestimated the damage to the integrity of the Social Securitysystem that the notch and the failure to correct it has caused,''Bruce Sumner, a director of the National Committee to PreserveSocial Security and Medicare, told the subcommittee.   But the American Association of Retired Persons and the NationalCouncil of Senior Citizens urged Congress not to tinker with the lawfor the benefit of the notch babies.   ``To focus on the unwarranted demands of one small group ofbeneficiaries could threaten the fiscal soundness of SocialSecurity, thereby affecting everyone,'' said Eugene Lehrmann ofMadison, Wis., vice chairman of AARP.   Hardest hit by the notch problem are high-earning retirees whohad long careers and worked past their 62nd birthday.   Some bills propose to correct the problem by raising SocialSecurity taxes, which would affect most workers. Others would reducebenefits to those born before 1917; still others would boostbenefits for the notch group and pay for the increase by raising thefederal deficit.   Using existing Social Security trust funds for this purpose``could put the system at additional risk should we experience aneconomic downturn in the next few years,'' said GAO's Delfico.   Robert J. Myers, former chief actuary for the Social Securitysystem, chaired a special non-government, nonpartisan panel ofSocial Security experts that studied the notch problem. The panel,he told the Finance subcommittee, ``recommends that Congress take nolegislative action on the notch benefit issue.''   ``The real problem ... is that those persons who were born before1917 who worked well beyond age 62 after 1978 receive unduewindfalls,'' Myers said. ``Those born after 1916 are equitablytreated, consistent with the intent of Congress, and receive properbenefit amounts.   ``There is no reason why younger workers should, over the years,pay more taxes to provide windfall benefits to this group,'' Myerssaid. ``Conversely, although there is a case for reducing (graduallyor otherwise) the windfall benefits for some persons born before1917, this would not now be equitable.''</TEXT></DOC>
