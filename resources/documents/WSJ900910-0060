The first installments of the new funding, however, fallfar short of the amount the trust has tried to raise inrecent months as it ran out of cash to pay the 130,000 claimsagainst it. Moreover, the preliminary agreement, announcedFriday, won't provide any new cash until the end of 1991. Theplan is also contingent on many other factors.</LP><TEXT>   The trust, the cornerstone of Manville's bankruptcy-courtreorganization plan in 1988, was set up to pay all healthclaims stemming from exposure to asbestos products formerlymade by the company. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal courtin New York ordered the trust to come up with new financingthis summer after the trust announced that it couldn't paynew claims for 25 years because it was out of cash.   Although victims' attorneys welcomed the new funding, somesaid they will challenge the change because they believe thatJudge Weinstein does not have the right to alter Manville'sbankruptcy reorganization plan. The attorneys fear thatvictims will lose some rights if the plan is revamped. Theyalso are challenging a freeze on claim payments that JudgeWeinstein has extended until Oct. 6.   &quot;To the extent that Manville has come up with more moneyfor the trust, I'm delighted,&quot; said Robert Hatten, aplaintiffs' attorney who is trying to collect a $60 millioncourt judgment from the trust for 1,117 asbestos victims inVirginia. &quot;The only caveat I have is, I want my money.&quot;   The preliminary funding agreement is contingent on thetrust coming up with new procedures for paying claims, suchas stretching payments over a period of time. Leon Silverman,appointed by Judge Weinstein and the bankruptcy court tonegotiate the restructuring, said progress is being made intalks between the trust and plaintiffs' attorneys about thepayment plan.   &quot;While this is only the first step in the overallrestructuring process, we are encouraged that a fair andcomprehensive resolution will result from the continuingcooperation of all parties,&quot; said John C. Sawhill, chairmanof the trust's board.   After paying about $638 million to asbestos victims, thetrust still owes more than $300 million in settled but unpaidclaims -- twice the amount of cash it has left. Before JudgeWeinstein stepped in, the trust and the company had beenunable to agree on new funding, although proposals to raisemore than $500 million were discussed.   Under the agreement, Manville would convert the preferredstock held by the Trust into common, giving the trust an 80%stake in the company. The company would pay a specialdividend to common shareholders of $125 million late in 1991,another $125 million a year later and $50 million in each ofthe next two years.   The agreement also provides for additional specialdividends to be paid in the next four years of as much as$300 million, making a total potential dividend of $650million, 80% of which -- or $520 million -- would go to thetrust. Except for the first proposed payment, the dividendswould be subject to Manville's ability to pay.   The new financing would not affect the company'sobligation to pay $75 million a year on $1.8 billion in bondsheld by the trust and to pay the trust 20% of Manville'sprofit beginning in 1992. The agreement also proposesexchanging the bonds for new ones that would be marketable.The trust would be able to sell the bonds at some point toraise money.   Manville's stock in recent months has suffered from theuncertainties surrounding the trust funding, and officials ofthe Denver-based building-products concern said they hope theinvestment community will &quot;look on this agreementpositively.&quot; In composite trading on the New York StockExchange Friday, Manville closed at $6.75 a share, up 75cents.   In a prepared announcement, Manville Chairman Tom Stephenssaid, &quot;Our strong performance since the consummation of theplan of reorganization in 1988 has put us in the position tobe able to accomplish this distribution program.&quot;   ---   NEW YORK LAW FIRM bows out of fraudulent conveyanceaction.   Stroock andamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan, accused of a conflict ofinterest, agreed not to represent Southmark Corp. or itscreditors in a multimillion-dollar suit against two formertop officials of Southmark.   The alleged conflict arose because Stroock, which servedas counsel to the Southmark unsecured creditors committeeduring Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, once representedthe former executives, Gene E. Phillips and William S.Friedman.   When Stroock was retained by the creditors last year, bothmen signed waivers saying they didn't object to therepresentation.   But then the creditors committee, acting on behalf ofSouthmark, filed suit seeking to recover more than $83million in assets from Messrs. Phillips and Friedman andcompanies they control. The complaint alleged that the assetswere fraudulently conveyed to the men as part of theirresignation settlements last year.   The former executives retained the Dallas firm of Bickel andamp;Brewer to sue to have Stroock dismissed from the case.   &quot;I think it's one thing to consent to your former attorneyhandling a nonadversarial matter, and something else for themto turn around and sue you,&quot; said Mr. Friedman, former vicechairman.   After some legal maneuvering, Stroock agreed not torepresent either the creditors committee or Southmark in theproceeding against the executives. But it is free torepresent the company, which recently emerged from bankruptcyprotection, in future legal matters.   &quot;We determined that, rather than spending another coupleof months litigating {the conflict issue}, reorganizedSouthmark should be freed to litigate on the merits&quot; of itscase against the executives, said Stroock partner CurtisMechling.   ---   COURT DECLINES TO EXPAND protection for Texaswhistleblowers.   The case was brought by Richard Winters, a former HoustonChronicle employee who said he was fired for tellingsuperiors about alleged circulation fraud and other illegalactivities at the newspaper, owned by Hearst Corp. A lowercourt dismissed the suit, and the Texas Supreme Courtaffirmed the dismissal.   At issue was whether Texas should follow 23 other statesthat protect private-sector employees who report illegalactivities in the workplace. Texas law does protect publicworkers, but private employers, with rare exceptions, arepermitted to hire and fire employees at will.   In ruling against Mr. Winters, the Texas Supreme Courtsaid his case didn't fall within the exceptions and said itwasn't inclined &quot;at this time on these facts&quot; to broaden theprotection for private-sector whistleblowers. The decisionoffered little additional explanation, but a concurringopinion by Judge Lloyd Doggett suggested that more protectionshould be warranted in some cases.   &quot;The judiciary should not ignore those unscrupulousemployers who wield the powerful weapon of the pink slip tointimidate workers into silence in order to conceal andperpetuate activities in the workplace that endanger thepublic,&quot; Judge Doggett wrote.   James W. Holtz, a Houston attorney representing Mr.Winters, said he was disappointed the court didn't explainits decision more fully but hadn't decided whether to seek arehearing.   G.E. McDavid, president of the Chronicle, said the paperhad &quot;expected&quot; the court to rule in its favor, asserting thatMr. Winters had made a number of &quot;wild allegations&quot; thatweren't true.   ---   TAX ON LEGAL SERVICES challenged in Massachusetts.   The Massachusetts and Boston bar associations filed suitin the state's Supreme Judicial Court challenging theconstitutionality of parts of a recently enacted 5% tax onservices.   The associations are seeking to exempt legal services fromthe tax, arguing that it illegally restricts access to legalservices, violates lawyer-client confidentiality and breachesstate and federal provisions that place the regulation oflawyers solely under the judicial branch.   In a statement, John P. Driscoll Jr., president of theBoston association, said, &quot;Although we have grave concernsfor the commonwealth's fiscal health, we are compelled totake a stand against measures that play fast and free withour fundamental constitutional rights.&quot;   The suit also says that the tax is unfair anddiscriminatory because it targets only certain businesses.   The court has already determined that the tax might bepermissible, but it didn't address key issues of applying thetax to legal services, the associations said.   The 5% levy on a host of business services is one of thebroadest such taxes in the nation. It was signed into law inJuly.   ---   SECOND OFFICER of New Jersey company pleads guilty to bankfraud.   Preston Davis, former assistant treasurer and assistantcontroller of Coated Sales Inc., pleaded guilty in federalcourt in Newark, N.J., to allegations he was involved in afraud scheme. Mr. Davis admitted that he and other officersof the defunct textile converting concern lied about theamount of the company's assets to secure a $52 millionrestructuring loan from BancBoston Financial Co. He alsoadmitted to conspiring to violate U.S. securities laws.   Peter V. Ryan, Mr. Davis's attorney, said his client&quot;accepted culpability&quot; but was &quot;following directions of hissuperiors.&quot;   Shortly before Coated Sales filed for bankruptcy-courtprotection in June 1988, the company was considered one ofthe fastest-growing ones traded on the over-the-countermarket, according to Michael Chertoff, U.S. attorney inNewark. By securing the loan with fictitious accountsreceivable, the officers boosted the company's net sales,total assets and earnings per share, he said.   Last month, the company's former chief financial officer,Bruce Bloom, also pleaded guilty to participating in thescheme.   ---   Michael Allen and Wayne E.
