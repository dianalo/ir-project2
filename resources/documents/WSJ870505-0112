KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Non-farm productivity rebounded in the first quarter after six months of decline, the Labor Department said.    The first-quarter increase, at a 1.7% annual rate, followed a drop at a revised annual rate of 1.5% in the fourth quarter, the department said in a preliminary report. The first-quarter rise occurred as output in the non-farm sector climbed at the highest rate since early 1984, the department said.    The statistics are adjusted for seasonal variations.    The latest figures on productivity, the measure of output for each hour worked, followed reports showing a sharp pickup in economic growth. The Commerce Department reported late last month that the real gross national product -- the total output of goods and services, adjusted for inflation -- grew at a 4.3% annual rate in the first quarter, spurred by an import decline and increased inventory investment. The GNP rise was much faster than that for the 1986 fourth quarter, and was the largest in nearly three years. Many analysts said the GNP report exaggerated the economy's strength, however.    The first-quarter productivity increase was the biggest in a year, and came after a string of productivity changes that had continued a sluggish trend. Productivity usually rises steeply in the earlier stages of a business recovery, and tapers off in the later stages, as output slows relative to the number of workers. Productivity in the current economic expansion reached a high in the second quarter of 1983, spurting at an annual 7.1% rate.    The current business recovery has lasted nearly 4 1/2 years, relatively long for postwar booms, but productivity gains for the expansion have been weaker than those for previous recoveries.    Outside of manufacturing, productivity has benefited as output picked up speed during the past three quarters, said Lawrence Fulco, an economist for the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Non-manufacturing employers have also boosted hours worked mostly by new hiring, rather than extending the workweek for existing employees, he noted, indicating the companies aren't &quot;nervous&quot; about the vigor of the economy. But he said it's difficult to draw conclusions about any productivity trend from preliminary figures on one quarter.    In the first quarter, a surge in non-farm production offset an increase in hours worked, the Labor Department's preliminary report showed. Output climbed at an annual rate of 5.4%, double the fourth-quarter pace, while work hours grew at a 3.6% rate, trailing a 4.3% rate in the previous quarter. The production increase was the largest since the first quarter of 1984.    Hourly compensation edged up at a 0.1% rate, after rising at a 2.7% rate in the fourth quarter. Adjusted for inflation, however, compensation declined at a 4.9% annual rate. Unit labor costs fell at a 1.6% rate, after rising at a 4.2% rate in the previous quarter.    Productivity in manufacturing rose at an annual rate of 1.4%, compared with a decline at a revised rate of 0.2% in the fourth quarter. Output increased at a 2.8% rate and hours worked rose at a 1.3% rate. Unlike the other business sectors, manufacturing industries' production increased at a slower pace in the first quarter than in the preceding quarter, when output grew at a revised annual rate of 3.2%.    The preliminary figures show that overall business productivity, including that of farms, rose at an annual rate of 1.8% in the first quarter, as output grew 5.1% and hours of work increased 3.2%. Productivity fell 2% in the fourth quarter of 1986. As with non-farm output, the overall production rise was at the highest rate since the first quarter of 1984. Hourly compensation in this sector rose 0.4% in the first quarter, the smallest quarterly increase since 1960.    The department also reported revised productivity growth at an annual rate of 0.1% in 1986 for non-financial corporations, which account for almost 60% of the nation's output. Their productivity rose at a 1.2% rate in 1985. Output gained 1.9% last year and hours of work increased 1.8%. The figures were little changed from an earlier preliminary report.    Hourly compensation at non-financial corporations last year rose 2.4%, unchanged from the preliminary report. This was the smallest rise since these figures were first recorded in 1959 and represented an increase of only 0.5% after taking inflation into account. </TEXT></DOC>
