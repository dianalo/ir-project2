The annual report of the Social Security and Medicare trustees said hospital benefits under Medicare -- the federal health program for the elderly -- will have to be reduced 13% or contributions increased 15% in order to have a solvent hospital trust fund over the next 25 years. The trustees said last year that the trust fund would go broke in 1996.    The hospital insurance portion of Medicare is funded through payroll tax deductions authorized under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. On annual income up to $43,800, 1.45% goes to Medicare, 5.2% to the Social Security retirement fund and 0.5% to disability insurance.    &quot;Lower hospital inflation and increased efficiency among health care providers, spurred in part by changes in Medicare policy, are prime factors in the improved estimate,&quot; said Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen. Along with Dr. Bowen, the trustees include the labor and Treasury secretaries and two presidentially appointed members from the public. </TEXT></DOC>
