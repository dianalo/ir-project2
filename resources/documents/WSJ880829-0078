The crackdown follows a surge of congressional concern that risky, high-growth lending has been allowed to swell losses within sick savings and loans. On Aug. 4, the Senate approved a flat ban on new lending by insolvent thrifts. While that didn't become law, it is expected to arise again when Congress returns in September.    Fearing an absolute ban on new loans would be harmful, Bank Board staff members have prepared their own flexible ban. Their draft policy would bar all new lending and investments by insolvent thrifts unless they are cleared by regulators.    &quot;If you're insolvent, the general premise is that you should not be growing,&quot; Darrell Dochow, head of the board's Office of Regulatory Affairs, said in an interview.    Current Bank Board policy allows the assets of insolvent thrifts -- and all others that fail to meet minimum capital standards -- to grow as fast as interest accumulates, or about 6% to 8%.    The crackdown is likely to make it harder for marginally insolvent thrifts to recover their health, and if strongly enforced, it will force most to shrink.    To meet criticism that enforcement has been spotty, the new policy also would increase the Bank Board's supervision of exceptions granted by supervisors in its 12 Home Loan banks. Sick thrifts would be forced to write monthly or quarterly reports to their supervisors, who would have to file quarterly reports with the Bank Board.    Mr. Dochow suggested that thrift supervisors will be stingier about granting exceptions and may rescind some. Recent discussions with supervisors have produced &quot;a better meeting of the minds&quot; on what growth plans are permissible, he said.    The policy, which awaits final approval by the Bank Board, is expected to be issued soon, Mr. Dochow said.    The action trails months of rising complaints from healthy thrifts that many weak institutions have been paying high rates to attract new deposits, then investing in risky ventures in a gamble to recover solvency. Critics charge that this drives up the cost of deposits for banks and thrifts and tends to multiply the embedded losses of insolvent thrifts, which are estimated at $30 billion to $75 billion.    The National Council of Savings Institutions, a trade group, said 105 insolvent institutions increased their assets -- mainly loans and investments -- during 1987. Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) charged last month that the Bank Board clearly &quot;is not enforcing its own growth regulations.&quot;    But Jonathan Fiechter, an aide to Mr. Dochow, contended that growth by insolvent thrifts already is &quot;pretty much under control.&quot; Only 37 of about 500 insolvent thrifts expanded their assets more than 10% last year, he said, and all but a few had good reasons for the growth.    Generally, regulators want to continue low-risk lending that preserves the value of an insolvent thrift that is approaching the auction block. For example, they said, they might let a broke thrift continue a successful mortgage-banking operation to avoid reducing the thrift's attractiveness to an acquirer. A loss of value would increase what the Bank Board needs to pay an acquirer to make up for the institution's embedded losses.    Officials declined to comment on criticism that thrift supervisors recently approved rapid-growth plans for two shaky thrifts. In one, Columbia Savings, a subsidiary of First Columbia Financial Corp., Englewood, Colo., planned a $1.5 billion investment in mortgage-backed security derivatives that are heavily affected by interest-rate fluctuations. In another, Benjamin Franklin Savings, a Houston subsidiary of Security Capital Corp., New York, won approval of a plan to double its assets by 1991.    Mr. Dochow said his staff has been meeting with district bank officials to discuss some approved plans that involve growth. He hinted that some are being changed.    Thrift regulators are considering other initiatives to curb risk. Mr. Fiechter said they may cut the cap on loans to one borrower to 25% of the lending institution's net worth from 100%. Following bank regulators' lead, they also are working on guidance to discourage investment by weak thrifts in arcane securities that pose high interest-rate risk.    More important, Mr. Dochow said, is a new emphasis on forcing thrift officers to look beyond wooden compliance with rules to ensuring that practices are safe and sound. &quot;I can give you examples of institutions with 5% growth that are unsafe and unsound,&quot; he said. Added another board official, &quot;You want managers that manage, not just follow rules.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
