As an attorney with a four-year-old son who is severely retarded owing to a fragile X chromosome, I am in that debate.    Setting aside the problem of what kind of people ask questions about the value of human life, it seems to me that the central question in the debate is which yardstick(s) will be used to measure human value. Some of the people quoted in Mr. Bishop's article suggest money and parental preference as two possibilities. Perhaps your readers would like to apply those yardsticks or others they might choose to the following:    Matthew is a blue-eyed, rusty-haired bundle of happy energy. He giggles when the family dog gives him a big, slurpy kiss on the nose. Learning to drink from a cup is enough reason to beam like a community Christmas tree. Matthew contentedly consumes unknown numbers of hamburgers, hot dogs, potato chips and everything else his mother serves him. While getting in the car for a Sunday drive in the country, he squeals with delight. Matthew expresses his love and affection for those around him without reservation.    The preceding describes some of the visible attributes of Matthew. But what about the things we cannot see? What yardstick do we apply to God's purposes, assuming we know them? </TEXT></DOC>
