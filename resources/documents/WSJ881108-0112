They are the leaders of a drive to transform the anti-business culture of woebegone Louisiana with a striking shift in its public policy.    The central figure is Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Roemer, 45, a Democrat, Harvard MBA, four-term U.S. congressman and, since last March, governor of Louisiana. &quot;My board of directors is the legislature, and my customers are the 4 1/2 million citizens,&quot; says Gov. Roemer, a former banker and head of a family computer firm.    But if Louisiana is an $8 billion business, it's a business in trouble. The Roemer administration inherited a $750 million shortfall for the 1988-89 fiscal year, in addition to a $1.37 billion outstanding state debt. With the lowest bond rating in the country, &quot;We had a tough time even borrowing our way out,&quot; said Stephanie Desselle of Mr. Roemer's staff. &quot;Thank goodness we've got a governor who knows creative financing.&quot;    By refinancing the debt, cutting spending by $500 million, and extending $700 million of &quot;temporary&quot; sales taxes for one year, Mr. Roemer managed to avert fiscal catastrophe. Now he faces problems that make that number crunching seem like child's play. Louisiana has the country's highest rates of unemployment (9.7%, nearly twice the national average), illiteracy and high-school dropouts. The state is near the bottom in per-capita personal income, teacher salaries, and job and business creation. New Orleans, the gaudy jewel in the state's crown, billed during its annual Mardi Gras spree as &quot;the city that care forgot,&quot; is more like the city that forgot to care, as Mayor Sidney Barthelemy slashes public services to deal with a $20 million budget deficit.    Matched against that array of problems is an administration elected on a clean-government model that has so far done as it promised. During his first seven months in office, Mr. Roemer raised teacher salaries 25% over three years and, amid cuts of 25% in the general fund (mostly in health and social agencies and transportation), demonstrated his priorities by increasing funding for the Department of Environmental Quality and for economic development.    The next battle, and the centerpiece of the &quot;Roemer Revolution,&quot; was to be fiscal reform. After a stormy special session last month, however, the legislature rejected his sweeping plan to shift the state tax burden from business to individuals who now benefit from some unusual breaks.    The package that failed proposed $300 million in tax cuts for business and industry. While keeping the state income-tax rate the same for most and even cutting it slightly in the highest bracket, it would have eliminated the deductibility of federal income tax. And most contentious, it would have lowered the &quot;homestead exemption,&quot; enshrined in the state constitution since the Depression and sparing up to 90% of Louisiana homeowners from any property tax. That typically would have meant a $400-a-year bite.    The goals, according to Mr. Roemer, were to stimulate the economy by creating a more favorable climate for investment, to equalize the tax burden and to provide a broader and more stable tax base for a government that has depended heavily on fluctuating oil and gas revenues.    All agree that the state must diversify its industrial base to escape the recently detrimental reliance on oil, said Ron Jones, chairman of the New Orleans Business Council and president of Louisiana Coca Cola Bottling Ltd. &quot;One of the reasons businesses don't come to this state is that we pay an inordinate amount of taxes to do business here,&quot; said Mr. Jones. &quot;Businesses, on average, pay 69% more tax in Louisiana than they do in the surrounding states.&quot; So, despite its considerable advantages of natural resources, deep water ports and location on the Mississippi River, Louisiana has gone bust while other Sun Belt states have boomed.    &quot;We've got to clean up our act,&quot; says James R. (Jim Bob) Moffett, chief executive officer of Freeport-McMoRan Inc., a natural-resources company. Mr. Moffett is the chief cheerleader and, some say, Mr. Roemer's sideline coach, for the fiscal changes. In fact, 80% of Mr. Roemer's original tax package was based on proposals developed by the Louisiana Council for Fiscal Reform, a consortium of businessmen, academics and community leaders Mr. Moffett chairs. &quot;The people that create the jobs and pay the taxes in this state are the ones who've got to take control,&quot; he says.    Obviously, some legislators looked askance at big business riding to the rescue and wondered, who elected Jim Bob Moffett? Though the bill passed the state Senate by the needed two-thirds margin, it was 10 votes short in the House. Opposition came from conservative Republicans and rural populist factions that have promoted citizen tax breaks since the days of Gov. Huey Long. &quot;The biggest beneficiaries of fiscal reform,&quot; says Edgar Chase, president of the Black Economic Development Council, &quot;are existing big businesses.&quot; Lawrence Chehardy, Jefferson Parish tax assessor, speaking for the 70 elected assessors who are Mr. Roemer's most vehement adversaries, claims, &quot;Basically the plan sticks it to the middle class.&quot; (Proponents claimed that a healthier economic climate in the state would more than make up for the damage to already-soft property values that an expanded home tax would do.)    Mr. Roemer maintains that &quot;the people who gain the most from tax reform and from a government that works fairly are the people who are trying to climb up but who are now at the bottom of the economic cycle.&quot; But the man he ousted as governor, populist Edwin Edwards, says, &quot;It's a gross misnomer to refer to the program as fiscal reform. It's really fiscal transfer -- transferring the tax burden from business and industry to the unemployed, underemployed, and employed citizens of the state.&quot;    A supply-side economist who's done work on fiscal policies of the states doubts that Mr. Roemer's approach would lure new business. Victor Canto, president of California-based A.B. Laffer Associates, speculates that if individuals pay more taxes, they will demand higher wages and companies ultimately will make lower profits.    Nevertheless, as national presidential candidates were sidestepping the deficit problem and scrupulously avoiding the &quot;T&quot; word (taxes), Mr. Roemer was talking tough. He vows to continue the fight. No one doubts it will take a super sell to win over the skeptical public. But chances of a watered-down version of Mr. Roemer's fiscal package passing before his term is out are enhanced by the fact that, as Ed Hardin, president of Louisiana Common Cause, says, &quot;No one denies the necessity of doing something.&quot;    Before Buddy Roemer, Louisiana operated according to former U.S. Sen. Russell Long's populist adage, &quot;Don't tax him, don't tax me, tax the fellow behind the tree.&quot; Mr. Roemer, the former tightfisted congressman who supported Ronald Reagan's economic policies more than any other current Democrat, now looks to change those bayou bywords with one of the Gipper's trademark touchdown drives.    ---   Ms. Strickland, a New York-based freelancer, writes frequently on Louisiana public affairs. </TEXT></DOC>
