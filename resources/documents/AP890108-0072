The move appeared to be part of a Soviet effort to improverelations with Israel in order to help broker a Middle East peaceplan, said Arens.   Arens said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze toldhim during a meeting in Paris Saturday that Moscow will ``allow ourdelegation to expand the volume and raise the level of its activity,and to view it as an address for political activities.   ``I think there's an important progress in it,'' he said in atelephone interview from Paris with Israel army radio. Arens andShevardnadze are in the French capital for an internationalconference on chemical arms.   Shevardnadze said on Israel television the ministers decided to``create normal working conditions for our consular groups in TelAviv and Moscow ... and to hold personal meetings.''   The Israeli delegation operates from the Dutch Embassy buildingin Moscow, and the Soviet one from the Finnish Embassy in Tel Aviv.   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic ties with the Israel followingthe 1967 Middle East war, in which Israel captured territories fromMoscow's Arab allies, but relations have improved in the past twoyears.   A well-informed Foreign Ministry official told The AssociatedPress the mandate of the Israeli delegation previously banned itfrom holding any political discussions or working from the formerbuilding of the Israeli embassy in Moscow, which it is now likely todo.   The group also had to renew visas every three months, a practicenow expected to be abandoned, said the official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Foreign Ministry sources indicated in private conversations theIsraelis may also be permitted to independently process visas forSoviet Jewish emigrants and Jews wishing to visit Israel.   The Soviets have allowed more Jews to emigrate to Israel and senta low-level consular delegation to Tel Aviv in July 1987. Israel wasallowed to send its own consular group to Moscow in July 1988.   Arens said Israel and the Soviet Union remain far apart on how toresolve Middle East conflicts.   ``Mr. Shevardnadze presented the Soviet position about the peaceprocess and the PLO. Their stand is totally different from ours,''Arens said.   But he added: ``They feel they can contribute to the peaceprocess and want to convince us they can. Together with that, ormaybe because of that, they want to build channels of communicationmore systematically.''   The Soviet Union wants a U.N.-sponsored peace forum and says thePalestine Liberation Organization must participate.   Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of Arens' hard-lineLikud bloc, fears the conference might force Israel into territorialconcessions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israel also refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it views asa terrorist group.   Arens said Shevardnadze reiterated the Soviet appreciation of theIsraeli rescue and medical aid provided to the victims of theearthquake in Armenia in December, and Israel's handling of the lastmonth's plane hijacking affair.   The case involved five Soviets who traded hostage children for aplane and about $2 million in cash and then flew the jet to Israel.The Jewish state returned the hijackers, the plane and the money tothe Soviets on Dec. 3.</TEXT></DOC>
