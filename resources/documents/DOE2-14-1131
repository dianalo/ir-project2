The value of CMC(II)decreases with the increase in chain length of the soap, whereas CMC(I)does not vary at all. The results show that the soaps behave as simpleelectrolyte. The major conductance at infinite dilution ({mu}sub(o))and dissociation constant (K) of these soaps have been evaluated. (author).12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
