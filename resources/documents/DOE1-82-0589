Ga imaging was negative in95% (20/21) of the patients who were clinically considered to be in remissionand in whom treatment was stopped. The disease did not recur during afollow-up of 12 to 26 months in 15 patients. Six patients developed recurrenceof the disease 3 to 12 months after treatment was stopped. In all sixpatients Ga imaging became positive again at the time of the appearanceof active disease. In the group of patients in remission, CT was negativein 57% (11/19), chest x-rays in 55% (6/11) and peripheral lymph nodeswere palpated in none of the patients (13/13). In four patients thatdid not achieve remission after treatment, Ga scans were positive. Gaimaging appears useful in monitoring lymphoma response to treatment.This is probably because Ga imaging monitors tumor cell viability, whereasbody CT and chest radiographs show the tumor mass, which may consistof fibrotic or necrotic tissue.</TEXT></DOC>
