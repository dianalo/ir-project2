Hiroshi Matsubara, former chief aide to the president ofRecruit-Cosmos Co., admitted trying to bribe an opposition lawmakerwho was investigating his company's role in the scandal.   ``I admit all charges. They are all factual,'' Kyodo News Servicequoted Matsubara as telling the Tokyo District Court. ``I deeplyregret my action and decided to accept charges in order to make anew start in my life.''   He also reiterated his earlier statement that he was acting onhis own and that Recruit-Cosmos, a real estate subsidiary of RecruitCo., had no part in the attemted bribery. Recruit is an informationservice conglomerate.   ``It was all done by myself and the money came from my ownsavings and loans from my friends,'' Kyodo quoted him as saying.   The Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office arrested Matsubara on Oct. 20for allegedly trying to give a $40,320 bribe to Parliament memberYanosuke Narazaki, the leading investigator of the scandal.   Narazaki, of the opposition United Social Democratic Party, fileda complaint with prosecutors saying he had been offered the cash inexchange for toning down his investigations and questioning inParliament.   The prosecution charged today that Matsubara acted out of fearthat Narazaki's investigation might damage Recruit-Cosmos as well aspeople who bought unlisted shares and then profited when publictrading of the stock began.   The scandal has led to the resignation of several govermentofficials and business leaders, including Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa and Hisashi Shinto, chairman of Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Co.   The transactions in the unlisted Recruit-Cosmos shares were legalunder Japanese law, but questions of ethics were raised againstpoliticians and public officials who took advantage of theirinfluence to earn handsome profits.   The case also highlighted a traditionally intimate link betweenpoliticians and business circles in Japan.   Public anger in the wake of the scandal led Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita to set up a committee to study possible revision of lawsregulating political fund-raising activities.   Another controversy erupted over Narazaki allowing a televisioncamera into his residence to record the bribery offer. NipponTelevision Broadcasting Network broadcast the tape on an eveningnews program.   Following Narazaki's complaint, prosecutors confiscated the tapefrom Nippon Television as evidence. The company fiercely protestedthe action, saying it interfered with freedom of the press.   Narazaki could face up to three years in prison on the briberycharge.</TEXT></DOC>
