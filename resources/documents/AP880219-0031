By pursuing market-oriented economic policies, we have uncorkedthe genie of American enterprise and created new businesses, morejobs, improved production, and widespread prosperity.   And we have done all this without neglecting the poor, theelderly, the infirm, and the unfortunate among us.</TEXT><TEXT>   This budget does not fully reflect my priorities, nor,presumably, those of any particular member of Congress.   But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reductionmust be paramount.   Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten oureconomic progress and burden future generations.</TEXT><TEXT>   I propose an increase of $656 million ... for discretionaryprograms of the Department of Education.

Building upon the nation's pre-eminence in basic biomedicalresearch, I seek a 5.1 percent increase for non-AIDS research atthe National Institutes of Health.</TEXT><TEXT>   For expanded law enforcement ... I propose $4.5 billion _ anincrease of 6 percent over 1988.   For drug law enforcement, prevention, and treatment programs, Ipropose $3.9 billion in 1989, a 13 percent increase over the 1988level.   To relieve prison overcrowding and adequately house a growinginmate population, I would provide $437 million _ more than doublethe $202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988.</TEXT><TEXT>   For the Federal Aviation Administration to continue itsmultiyear program to modernize the nation's air traffic controlsystems, I would provide $1.6 billion _ a 44 percent increase overthe level of 1988.</TEXT><TEXT>   To carry out the joint recommendations of the U.S. and Canadianspecial envoys on acid rain, I recommend total funding of $2.5billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projectsover the period 1988 through 1992.   I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanupefforts, with an increase in Superfund outlays of some $430 millionin 1989.   To continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at thecurrent rate of 50,000 barrels per day, I would provide $334million in 1989.

It alsoprovides for about 2 percent real growth in these programs infuture years....</TEXT><TEXT>   ...I plan to continue pushing for the elimination ofartificially high (farm) price supports, thereby reducing the needfor export subsidies.</TEXT><TEXT>   The budget proposes certain reforms in the Medicare program ...to limit payments for certain overpriced physician procedures,limit payments for durable medical equipment and supplies, andeliminate a loophole in the payment process for kidney dialysis. Intotal, these reforms would reduce spending for Medicare by $1.2billion from the level that would occur if current law werecontinued.</TEXT><TEXT>   The government often continues programs at the federal levelthat are no longer needed.
