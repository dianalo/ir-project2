The condition fora value of an incident wave amplitude is given, in fulfilling of whichthe optical thickness of plasma due to the decay instability becomeslarger than the optical thickness of the direct cyclotron absorptionzone. The process considered is possible when plasma is heated by powerfulradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
