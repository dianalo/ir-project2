In an internal memo, the big investment bank said it isdoling out year-end bonuses totaling 25% of salary formid-level employees, who aren't partners and who receive thebulk of their compensation in salary. That's up from 23% lastyear, 22% in 1989 and 24% in 1988. While Goldman paid bonusesof 25% in 1985 and 1986, overall compensation levels forthese employees were lower then, so this year's bonuses willbe bigger.</LP><TEXT>   The bigger Goldman bonuses are an early indication thatcompensation envelopes on Wall Street will be the fattest inat least four years. Goldman's fiscal year ends Friday; mostother securities firms base their bonuses on the calendaryear and dole out the checks in January. Wall Streetinvestment bankers, in particular, are expected to receivebonuses about one-third higher than last year's, executivessay, boosted by a record year in stock and bond underwriting.   &quot;There's a lot of money around; this was a tremendousearnings year&quot; for the securities industry, said John Keefe,a brokerage analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.Securities firms have earned about $4 billion in pretaxprofits in 1991's first three quarters, their bestperformance since 1987.   But Mr. Keefe says Goldman and other securities firms willbe reluctant to give outrageously fat paychecks that wereroutine in the roaring '80s because of strict cost-controlefforts. &quot;The sports-personality pay will be missing thisyear on Wall Street,&quot; Mr. Keefe said.   Bonuses to Goldman's 146 partners are paid out separatelybased on the firm's profitability; the firm is likely to earnas much as $900 million or more for its fiscal 1991, analystssay.   Despite the bulkier compensation, Goldman cautionedemployees that the firm's fortunes could quickly turn. &quot;Whilewe are obviously pleased about these 1991 results, we believethe risk of substantially worsened {securities} industryconditions is very real, given the uncertain state of theU.S. economy and many other economies around the world.&quot;   And any severe downdrafts in Goldman's earnings willtranslate into lower bonuses, the firm told employees. &quot;It isimportant that everyone understand that if our earningsdecline, compensation levels will be affected and may alsodecline, and that we should all be prudent with respect topersonal expenses during strong years,&quot; the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
