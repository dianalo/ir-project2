Introduction and Background </ITAG>Section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act requires that States participating inthe Formula Grants Program ``(14) provide that, beginning after the five-yearperiod following December 8, 1980, no juvenile shall be detained or confinedin any jail or lockup for adults, except that the Administrator shall through1989, promulgate regulations which make exceptions with regard to the detentionof juveniles accused of non-status offenses who are awaiting an initialcourt appearance pursuant to an enforceable State law requiring such appearancewithin twenty-four hours after being taken into custody (excluding weekendsand holidays) * * *.'' Section 223(a)(14) limits this exception to areasthat are outside a standard metropolitan statistical area. Section 233(c) of the JJDP Act further provides that a State's ``(c) ** * Failure to achieve compliance with the requirements of Subsection (a)(14)within the five-year time limitation shall terminate any State's eligibilityfor funding under this subpart, unless the Administrator determines that:(1) The State is in substantial compliance with such requirement throughthe achievement of not less than 75 percent removal of juveniles from jailsand lockups for adults; and (2) the State has made through appropriateexecutive or legislative action, an unequivocal commitment to achievingfull compliance within a reasonable time, not to exceed three additionalyears.'' Section 31.303(f)(6)(iii) of the OJJDP Formula Grants Regulation, whichwas published in the June 20, 1985, <T4>Federal Register, </T4>at pages 25550-25561, 28 CFR Part 31, establishesthree ways for a State to demonstrate full compliance with the section223(a)(14) requirement. First, ``Full compliance is achieved when a Statedemonstrates that the last submitted monitoring report, covering a fulland actual 12 months of data, demonstrates that no juveniles were heldin adult jails or lockups in circumstances that were in violation of section223(a)(14)'' (28 CFR 31.303(f)(6)(iii)). The remaining two ways to demonstrate full compliance involve the legalconcept of de minimis. First, a State may be found in full compliance withde minimis exceptions where all instances of noncompliance violated a Statelaw, court rule, or other statewide executive or judicial policy; the instancesof noncompliance do not indicate a pattern or practice; an enforcementmechanism exists; and, an acceptable plan has been developed to eliminatethe noncompliant incidents (28 CFR l31.303(f)(6)(iii)(A)). Second, a State may demonstrate full compliance by achieving a rate ofnoncompliant incidents, per 100,000 juvenile population in the State, thatfalls below the de minimis rate established by OJJDP. This de minimis rate,as set forth below, is being added to the OJJDP Formula Grants Regulationat andSection; 31.303(f)(6)(iii)(B) which is currently designated ``Reserved.''Office of Justice Programs Office of General Counsel Legal Opinion 76-7provides the legal basis upon which OJJDP establishes this de minimis exception.Specifically, the legal opinion allows OJJDP to tolerate a limited numberof instances of noncompliance (the legal opinion addressed the deinstitutionalizationof status offenders requirement) that are of ``slight consequence'' or``insignificant'' in making a determination regarding a State's achievingfull compliance. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Comments</ITAG>A proposed policy was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 9, 1988, for public comment. One commentwas received and has been considered by the OJJDP in the issuance of afinal policy.1. <T3>Comment: </T3>Each State should have the option of providing the juvenilepopulation figure to be used in calculating the de minimis rate for theyear in which this exception is requested. The U.S. Bureau of Census juvenilepopulation figures used by the OJJDP may not accurately reflect rapid changesin a State's juvenile population.<T3>Response:</T3> The OJJDP will continue to use the U.S. Bureau of Censusjuvenile population figures, which are annually updated by the Bureau,to calculate each State's rate of compliance with the jail removal provisionof the JJDP Act. This is necessary in order to ensure a uniform basis formaking de minimis calculations.However, when juvenile population figures available within the State demonstratea rate below the allowable de minimis rate, while use of U.S. Bureau ofCensus figures indicate a rate above the allowable de minimis rate, theState may request the OJJDP to accept the State's figures. Such requestswill be reviewed on a case by case basis, and must be submitted each yearthe State wishes to be exempted from the requirement to use U.S. Bureauof Census figures. The OJJDP may accept the State's juvenile populationfigures when they are the product of an established annual informationcollection system. The information collection system and its primary usagemust be described in the State's annual request for a finding of full compliancewith de minimis exceptions, and must be approved by the Administrator asvalid and reliable.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Policy and Criteria for De Minimis Exceptions to Full Compliancewith the Jail Removal Requirement</ITAG>The criteria presented below and set forth in the final regulation willbe applied by OJJDP in determining whether a State has achieved, and subsequentlymaintained, a numerical finding of full compliance with de minimis exceptionswith the jail and lockup removal requirement of section 223(a)(14). Alsospecified is the time frame for submitting information which each Statemust provide when requesting an initial or subsequent finding of full compliancewith a de minimis exceptions under 28 CFR 31.303(f)(6)(iii)(B).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Criteria</ITAG>The criteria for finding full compliance with de minimis exceptions isthat the incidents of noncompliance are insignificant, or of slight consequence,in terms of the total juvenile population in the State.In applying this criteria, OJJDP will compare each State's noncompliancerate per 100,000 population under age 18 to the average rate that has beencalculated for 12 States (three States from each of the four Bureau ofCensus regions). The 12 States selected by OJJDP were those having thelowest rates of noncompliance per 100,000 juvenile population and whichhad an adequate system of monitoring for compliance. Those States usingthe non-MSA exception, provided for in section 223(a)(14), were not includedin calculating the average. Inclusion of these States would have createdan artifically low average because the exception expires in 1989.The information provided by the 12 States' 1986 Monitoring Reports indicatedan average annual rate of nine (9) incidents of noncompliance per 100,000juvenile population. Consequently, those States which have a noncompliancerate in excess of nine (9) per 100,000 juvenile population will be consideredpresumptively ineligible for a finding of full compliance with de minimisexceptions, pursuant to andSection; 31.303(f)(6)(iii)(B) of the Formula GrantsRegulation.When a State can demonstrate, however, that recently enacted changes inState law which have gone into effect can reasonably be expected to havea substantial, significant and positive impact on the State's level ofcompliance, OJJDP will consider this exceptional circumstance in makingits determination of full compliance with de minimis exceptions. This exceptionalcircumstance will only be applied where the legislation is expected toproduce full (100%) compliance or full compliance with de minimis exceptionsby the end of the monitoring period immediately following the monitoringperiod under consideration.OJJDP deems it to be a requirement of critical importance that all Statesannually demonstrate continued and meaningful progress toward 100 percentcompliance in order to remain eligible for a finding of full compliancewith de minimis exceptions pursuant to andSection; 31.303(f)(6)(iii)(B) ofthe Formula Grants Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This regulation does not constitute a ``major'' rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291 because it does not result in: (a) An effect on the economyof $100 million or more, (b) major increase in any costs or prices, or(c) adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,or innovation among American enterprises.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This regulation does not have ``significant'' economic impact on a substantialnumber of small ``entities,'' as defined by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354).<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>No new collection of information requirements are contained in this regulation(See the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 31</ITAG>Grant programs-law, Juvenile delinquency, Reporting and recordkeeping requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 31_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

When the annual rate for a State exceeds 9 incidentsof noncompliance per 100,000 juvenile population, the State will be consideredineligible for a finding of full compliance with de minimis exceptionsunder the numerical de minimis standard unless the State has recently enactedchanges in State law which have gone into effect and which the State demonstratescan reasonably be expected to have a substantial, significant and positiveimpact on the State's achieving full (100%) compliance or full compliancewith de minimis exceptions by the end of the monitoring period immediatelyfollowing the monitoring period under consideration.(<T3>3</T3>) <T3>Progress</T3>. Beginning with the monitoring report due by December31, 1990, any State whose prior full compliance status is based on havingmet the numerical de minimis standard set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(B)(<T3>1</T3>) (<T3>i</T3>) and (<T3>ii</T3>) of andSection; 31.303, must annually demonstrate, in its requestfor a finding of full compliance with de minimis exceptions, continuedand meaningful progress toward achieving full (100%) compliance in orderto maintain eligibility for a continued finding of full compliance withde minimis exceptions.(<T3>4) </T3><T3>Request Submission. </T3>Determinations of full compliance and fullcompliance with de minimis exceptions are made annually by OJJDP followingsubmission of the monitoring report due by December 31 of each calendaryear.
