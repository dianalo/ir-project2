Chairman William Seidman indicated that the agency expects to provide assistance this year to two more big Texas banks that have been seeking FDIC help.    The two banks are Texas American Bancshares Inc., Fort Worth, and National Bancshares Corp. of Texas, San Antonio, which asked the FDIC last April to provide financial assistance for their proposed merger. The banks, along with First RepublicBank, Dallas, are identified in a speech by Mr. Seidman prepared for delivery tonight and in an accompanying press release as the three &quot;large Texas banks&quot; that the FDIC expects to help this year.    First Republicbank already has received a $1 billion loan from the FDIC, and is expected to get more.    Conspicuously absent from Mr. Seidman's list is Dallas's MCorp., Texas' second largest bank holding company, which is attempting to raise new capital without FDIC help. Its omission suggests that Mr. Seidman doesn't expect to have to come to its aid.    Also in the speech, Mr. Seidman makes his lowest estimate to date of the likely loss this year for the FDIC's $18.3 billion insurance fund, saying the fund &quot;could&quot; lose 10% of its capital. Previously, he said the loss wouldn't exceed 20%.    Texas American has $5.2 billion in assets, and National Bancshares has $2.7 billion. When they proposed joining together, they expressed hopes that the merged bank's broader geographic reach might enable it to raise new equity capital.    An FDIC spokesman said the agency is still negotiating with the banks, and will aid them if satisfactory terms can be arranged.    Mr. Seidman's speech was prepared for delivery to the Oregon Bankers Association. The agency released a summary, in which Mr. Seidman says, &quot;we expect to handle three more large Texas banks this year.&quot;    &quot;Once these transactions are consummated,&quot; the speech continues, &quot;the main financial costs should be behind us and the insurance fund should begin to grow again.&quot;    In Fort Worth, Joseph M. Grant, chairman and chief executive officer of Texas American, said the bank hadn't received any definitive answer from the FDIC regarding its proposal for a federally assisted merger with National Bancshares.    The prospect of federal aid to a Texas American-National Bancshares combination would mean that of the 10 leading banking companies in Texas just two years ago, six turned to the government for assistance. All of the banks' problems stem from the 1986 drop in the price of oil followed by the bust in Southwest real estate values that has shot holes in their loan portfolios.    After two years of almost uninterrupted losses, all of the institutions are desperate for equity capital. But it is so scarce that those that can't find it in the marketplace have been forced to turn to the FDIC. Texas American believes it could survive as a separate entity without FDIC aid, but not without shrinking the company's balance sheet, additional layoffs and a capital-raising effort.    Separately, the FDIC arranged for newly chartered Northwest Bank, Houston, to take over the deposits and secured liabilities of Northwest Bank and Trust, which was closed by Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth Littlefield. Northwest Bank will purchase $92.6 million of the failed bank's $100.9 million in assets at a discount of $34.9 million. The Houston bank was the 82nd to fail this year, the 37th in Texas.    Also, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, proposed that it and all uninsured depositors be paid off ahead of any unsecured creditors in liquidations of federally chartered thrifts in eight states that prescribe such treatment for state-chartered thrifts. Currently, creditors and uninsured depositors have equal claims on assets of federally chartered thrifts in these states: Georgia, Indiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.    The change would increase the recoveries for the Bank Board and uninsured depositors at the expense of creditors. The Bank Board also solicited comment on whether it should apply the change to all federally chartered or federally insured thrifts liquidated by the board.    ---   Leonard M.
