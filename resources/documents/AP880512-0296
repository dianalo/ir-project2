The Commerce Department said that sales totaled a seasonallyadjusted $131.6 billion last month as sales fell $815 million fromMarch.   The 0.6 percent drop was the first decline since a 0.8 percentsetback last October. The March performance was revised upward,however, to show an increase of 1.7 percent, the biggest advancesince August and much stronger than the originally reported 0.8percent gain.   The swings in both months came from the fact that Easter cameearly this year, meaning that consumers did their spring shoppingin March and siphoning off sales from April.   In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the Northeast and Westdampened sales for spring apparel as well as for lawn and gardenitems.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on thereport, said, ``Fortunately, the weakness in April may serve todampen inflationary expectations.''   Given all the unusual influences, analysts said the weak Aprilsales report did not alter their general assessment that theeconomy has been performing well so far this year.   Total economic activity, as measured by the gross nationalproduct, rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first threemonths of the year, far better than the recession fears immediatelyfollowing the stock market crash last October would have indicated.   The surprisingly strong growth has caused interest rates to risein recent weeks as investors have begun worrying about inflationarypressures. Major banks boosted their prime lending rate onWednesday to 9 percent, the first increase since last October.   The retail sales report showed widespread weakness in a numberof areas.   Car sales fell for the first time since November, declining by 1percent, to a seasonally adjusted $29.7 billion. Strong car sales,propelled by sales incentive programs, have provided much of theoverall strength in consumer spending so far this year.   Without the weakness in car sales, total retail sales would havebeen a slightly lower 0.5 percent in April.   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last at leastthree years, dropped 0.6 percent. Sales of non-durable goods fellan identical 0.6 percent.   In the durable goods category, sales at hardware and buildingsupply stores were up 1 percent while sales at furniture storesfell by 0.2 percent.   In the non-durable goods cateogry, sales at department storesdropped 0.5 percent, erasing part of the 2.1 percent jump in March.Both months were influenced by the early Easter.   Sales at grocery stores fell 0.3 percent in April while sales atgasoline stations were off 1.3 percent and sales at restaurantsdropped 1.6 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
