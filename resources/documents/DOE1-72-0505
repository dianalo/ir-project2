We find thatthe Ge crystallizes at reduced temperatures in the range of 100-200{degree}Cdepending on the thickness of the Ge and the Pb. Simultaneously the textureof the Pb improves and the layered structure completely disappears. Thebasis for the reduction of the crystallization temperature is the enhanceddiffusion kinetics at the interface, caused by the adjacent Pb layer.20 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
