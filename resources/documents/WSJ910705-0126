I am apt to believe that itwill be celebrated by succeeding generations as the greatanniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the dayof deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows,games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, fromone end of this continent to the other, from this timeforward forevermore.&quot;   So John Adams wrote to Abigail Adams on July 3, 1776. Thesecond day of July 1776 was the day that the resolution forindependence, drafted by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia, wasadopted. July Fourth, the day of the signing of theDeclaration of Independence turned out to be the day of thegreat anniversary but in every significant regard, JohnAdams's impassioned prediction about the holiday has beenborne out. Two hundred and fifteen years of succeedinggenerations have solemnized the day of deliverance in the wayhe envisioned -- with pomp and parade, bonfires andilluminations.</LP><TEXT>   This Independence Day weekend, as always, the flags areflying and the parades forming up across the nation. There issomething special about the holiday observances this year.The difference so evident in the air, in the mood and in thenumbers attending patriotic celebrations is that this is theyear of Desert Storm.   Not everyone is thrilled. These celebrations, and thepatriotism on display so recently in the Desert Storm victoryparades, have set off some uneasy churning and editorializingabout the difference between bad patriotism and the goodkind. There have been painstaking definitions about whatconstitutes offensive and dangerous patriotism, about thetone patriotism should have, when it should be dusted off andallowed out. These ruminations about what good patriotism isall about have been pouring forth in response to the clearmessage the nation's citizens have been sending the pastseven months.   That message, however, goes well beyond their wholeheartedsupport of Desert Storm and its combatants. It is about thewill to assert natural allegiances, to be what Americans havealways been -- exercisers of that civic virtue known aspatriotism. They know, most of all, that this is a nationunique for its freedoms.   It is a uniqueness appreciated by those in our own societywho have known the lash of hatred and injustice. This is thenation that fought the Civil War, and in the many yearssince, no nation in history has striven so mightily to rightthe wrongs of injustice. It was with deep feeling andrecognition that Clarence Thomas murmured, &quot;Only in America,&quot;on being nominated to the Supreme Court.   A while back a Jewish chaplain in the U.S. Navy foundhimself part of a delegation of Americans en route to seeMikhail Gorbachev to plead for the rights of Soviet Jews.What would he say to Gorbachev? a reporter asked. He didn'thave to tell Gorbachev anything, the chaplain replied. &quot;All Ihave to do,&quot; he said, &quot;is stand there in front of him with myU.S. Navy uniform with the Ten Commandments on the sleeve.&quot;That, thought the chaplain, should be testimony enough aboutthe character of a free nation.   We're not too worried about the kind of patriotismflourishing in the land this weekend. John Adams, we suspect,had a pretty good idea what he was unleashing with his bells,bonfires, pomp and parade. A great anniversary -- forwardforevermore.</TEXT></DOC>
