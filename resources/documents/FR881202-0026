After the proposalwas published, post cards notifying mining claimants that it was availablefor comment were sent to approximately 60,000 entities in the United States.This outreach effort generated 557 comments, from 420 individuals, 100businesses in the mining industry, 33 environmental and mining associations,and 4 units of local government. The individuals, businesses, associations,and local governments represent all regions of the United States, but themajority originated from States west of the Mississippi River.The comments addressed all aspects of the proposed rulemaking. All commentsreceived were given careful consideration and are addressed in the preamble,either as general comments on the rulemaking as a whole or as specificcomments connected with particular proposed changes. In general, the correspondentsagreed that regulatory and procedural changes to the program for processingand administering mining claims and patents were needed to clarify terminologyor increase program efficiency. They generally disagreed, however, withthe methods by which the Bureau proposed to increase efficiency, particularlythe Bureau of Land Management's (Bureau) proposals to establish or increaseservice charges (user fees) for the filing of various mining-claim-relateddocuments. Descriptions of the comments and discussions of their dispositionare grouped into either the general comments or specific comments sectionsbelow. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments</ITAG>Three comments challenged the Bureau's authority to record mining claimson public lands. Two of them believed that the Bureau should return itsrecordation function to the counties where the claims are located. Thiscomment cannot be adopted because its adoption is not legally possible.The Bureau is required by section 314 of the Federal Land Policy and ManagementAct of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744) to record mining claims. That statute requiresthe owners of unpatented lode or placer mining claims located before October21, 1976, to file within 3 years after October 21, 1976, the following:(1) A copy of the official record of the notice of location, includinga description of the location of the mining claim sufficient to locatethe claim on the ground, and (2) a notice of intention to hold the miningclaim or an affidavit of assessment work performed on the claim. The statutealso requires that the claimholder file a notice of intention to hold themining claim or an affidavit of assessment work each year after the initialfiling and before December 31. Owners of mill sites and tunnel sites mustcomply with (1), above, under the statute. Under regulations promulgatedJanuary 27, 1977, such owners are required to comply with (2). The statutefurther requires all claims and sites located after the date of enactmentto be recorded within 90 days of location and, in order to hold the miningclaim or site, that a notice of intention to hold the mining claim or anaffidavit of assessment work be filed every calendar year after the yearof location.The statute further states that failure to file either the notice of intentor the assessment work affidavit would constitute an abandonment of themining claim by the owner, but that the claim would not be considered abandonedif the notice of intent or assessment was defective or late under otherFederal laws requiring filing or recording of mining claims, or if theinstrument is filed for record by or on behalf of some but not all of theowners of the mining claim or mill site.The constitutionality of section 314 was challenged in court. On October24, 1983, the District Court for the District of Nevada declared section314 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) unconstitutional.The United States appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court.Because of this action, on January 31, 1984, all decisions on mining caserecordation cases that were considered abandoned and void were suspendedat the request of the Director of the Department of the Interior's Officeof Hearings and Appeals, pending a Supreme Court decision on the constitutionalquestion.On April 1, 1985, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Section314 of FLPMA in its entirety. (See <T3>United States v. Locke</T3>, 471 U.S. 84, 1985.) In its <T3>de novo</T3> review of BLM's procedures, it also found the Bureau'sadministrative system for mining claim recordation processing to be reasonableand adequate. Since that date, the Bureau has been implementing the miningclaim recordation system with the objective of maintaining accurate miningclaim records.Several comments on the proposed rulemaking disputed 2 statements madein the preamble: (1) That the regulatory proposals were not a major Federalaction significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and(2) that the proposed regulatory changes would not have an adverse effecton a substantial number of small entities. These comments argued that theeconomic effects of the proposed service charge increases would cause significantadverse effects both on the socio-economic environment and on small businessesin the mining industry. Because the proposal to establish a service chargefor the annual filing of either an affidavit of assessment work or a noticeof intent to hold was the focus of most comments, the discussion belowcenters on that service charge.According to Bureau of Land Management records, approximately 85 percentof Federal mining claimants hold 20 or fewer mining claims. According toone comment, California has the lowest claimholder rate, an average of2.7 claims per claimholder. By contrast, only 1.3 percent of all miningclaimants hold more than 200 claims and 0.1 percent hold more than 1,500claims each. Although there are exceptions, claimholders holding 1,500or more claims tend to be medium to large-sized companies, including minersof uranium, precious metals, and base metals.The proposed rulemaking provided for a $5 per claim per year filing feeon affidavits of annual assessment work and notices of intent to hold.Mining claimants are required by law to do not less than $100 worth ofassessment work on or for the benefit of each lode or placer claim eachyear. Expenditures for mill sites and tunnel sites are necessary as wellto maintain their validity. The filing fee would increase the Federallyimposed component of the cost of maintaining each claim by not more than5 percent per year. This increase would amount to $15 for the average Californiaclaimant and not more than $100 for the 85 percent of all claimants whohold 20 or fewer claims. Because many claimants seeking to make discoverieson their claims are doing more than the minimum $100 annual labor, theircost increase would be less than 5 percent.The fee schedule could be considered by some individuals to favor smallentities because the new service charges on a small claimholder, one holding20 claims or less, would be at most $100 per year.The service charge increases could also benefit small claimholders by reducingthe number of what many comments referred to as ``paper hangers,'' individualswho locate large numbers of mining claims for speculative purposes only.According to some comments, these ``paper hangers'' hold up to 2,000 claimseach. The Bureau expects that an elastic response will occur. That is,some claimants holding large numbers of claims are expected to relinquishor drop their more marginal claims rather than pay the new annual filingfee. These lands would then be available for exploration by other individuals.The response to service charge increases will be inelastic where marketdemands support the location of claims for a particular mineral commodity,and those claims will not likely be relinquished to avoid the filing fee.In support of this expectation, we note that Nevada counties have recentlyraised their recording fees for affidavits of assessment work, also chargedon a per-claim basis. Numbers of claims filed there have increased significantly,not decreased, despite the increase in recording fees, because of factorssuch as the increased price of gold and the State's geological favorabilityfor precious metal deposits.The foregoing discussion is not a substitute for the description and analysisof comments addressing the service charge schedule proposals. That discussionis located at 43 CFR 3833.1-3, below. The data presented above are supportfor the conclusion that the fee increases would not adversely affect asubstantial number of small businesses or create unacceptable socio-economiceffects because the burden of the increases would fall equally on all claimholdersand is only a small increase in costs of exploration and mining.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Comments</ITAG>43 CFR 3833.0-5The proposed rulemaking created the definitions of ``relocation'' at andSection;3833.0-5(q) and ``amended location'' at andSection; 3833.0-5(p) to reduceconfusion among mining claimants on which of the terms should be used whenrecording their mining claims with the Bureau. Approximately 85 percentof those commenting on this section concluded that the proposed definitionsfurther confused mining claimants rather than reducing their confusion.Only 15 percent of those commenting on this section supported the definitionsas proposed.Those opposing the definitions pointed out that they conflicted with establishedcase law, at both the Federal and State levels, and that they posed problemsfor prospectors in the field. They stated that the definition of ``amendednotice of location'' eliminated the possibility of adding lands to an existingclaim. Historically, the comments noted, mining claimants have been allowedto amend their claims to take in additional unappropriated ground. In addition,one comment noted a logical inconsistency within the definition of ``amendednotice of location''. The definition stated that an amended notice couldbe used to make changes in the position of claim boundary monuments, butcould not be used to add lands to a claim. However, changes in boundaryposition add or remove lands from the claim. As a result of these comments,the final rulemaking revises the definition of ``amended notice of location''to allow for the inclusion of additional unappropriated lands.Opponents of the definition of ``relocation'' interpreted it to mean thata claimant must waive all rights to a prior claim if he files a new claim.They stated that frequently no definitive distinction could be made betweenan amendment and a relocation on the ground and that, if the claimant choseincorrectly, he or she could lose all rights to the claim. This would bein conflict with case law in certain States.The final rulemaking removes the phrase ``which is adverse to any formerlocation on the same lands'' from the definition of relocation. The purposeof the definition is administrative, that is, the definition is intendedto assist Bureau employees in determining whether to assign a new serialnumber to a relocated claim or to retain the serial number on an amendedclaim while noting the amendment. It is not the intention of the Bureauto decide whether or not claimants have correctly identified their claimsas amended or relocated for the purpose of maintaining title under themining law. The Bureau's intention is to decide in which set of case filesthe document belongs.A few correspondents encouraged the Bureau to accept hybrid claims as legitimatefilings. Hybrid claims are combination documents which both amend and relocatea claim at the same time. The comments stated that the filing of such adocument gives better protection to claimants if the validity of theirclaims is challenged in court. The suggestion is not adopted. Acceptanceof hybrid claims would involve the setting up of two separate, parallelcase files for each claim. Maintaining parallel case files is contraryto Department policy, which was established by several Interior Board ofLand Appeal cases (<T3>R. Gail tibbets et al</T3>., 43 IBLA 210 (1979), as modified by <T3>Hugh B. Fate, Jr. et al</T3>., 86 IBLA 215 (1985) and <T3>Russell Hoffman (On Reconsideration)</T3>, 87 IBLA 146 (1985)). Theprincipal difficulty in administering parallel files for a claim is thatof determining which of the case files constitutes the official recordof the claim, if the claim is litigated. Therefore, a hybrid claim, ifsubmitted, will be treated as if it is an amended notice of location andwill be adjudicated in connection with the existing mining claim case fileof record.At the suggestion of one comment, the section now contains a definitionof ``authorized officer.'' The comment noted that the term was used inmany sections of the regulations but was not defined in this subpart.43 CFR 3833.1-3The Bureau proposed to establish or increase the established service chargesfor the following actions: (1) The filing of initial recordations of miningclaims and sites and (2) the annual filings of affidavits of assessmentwork and notices of intent to hold mining claims, amendments to location,and transfers of interest. The service charge for the filing of an initialclaim or site would be increased from $5 to $10 per claim. New servicecharges of $5 would be imposed on each of the annual filings.This section generated the largest number of comments on the proposed rulemaking.Approximately 90 percent of those commenting stated positions or made suggestionson this proposal. Some comments both stated positions and made suggestionsso that the percentages and categories described below may overlap. Thecomments can be sorted into six categories: (1) Approximately 70 percentof the comments either categorically opposed the fees without stating areason or stated that they would be a burden and a hardship on the smallminer; (2) approximately 15 percent thought that the fees to be imposedshould be based on a per-document, rather than a per-claim charge; (3)4 percent suggested that fees for the annual filing of assessment workshould be based on a sliding scale, usually $5 each for the first 10 claimsor sites and then 50 cents or $1 each for the rest on the same document;(4) 1 percent suggested discounts for various groups, including small minersand senior citizens; (5) 7 percent were satisfied with the proposal aswritten; and (6) 2 percent suggested that the proposed fees were too lowand recommended fees of up to $100 to record annual filings, plans, andnotices, these increased fees to be used to offset the costs of reclamationof public lands which had been mined.The category one correspondents based their arguments on the filing feesactually being a tax that would force the small miner out of business,and compared the fees to those charged by County Recorders. County Recorderfees were noted to be significantly lower.Statute and case law make a distinction between taxes and service charges.A tax is a charge imposed by legislatures or other authorities on citizensto pay for public services or to meet the demands of managing a government.The citizens upon whom the taxes are imposed may or may not directly benefitfrom the services. Service charges are charges imposed on the users ofspecific programs, and these users will directly benefit from the servicesprovided. Service charges serve a cost-recovery function in that the governmentor other organization uses the money to defray the cost of providing theservice. Taxes are authorized by Federal and State constitutions or relatedrevenue statutes. User fees, at the Federal level, are allowed by TitleV of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (31 U.S.C. 9701). Policiesimplementing that law require that a charge to recover the costs of programadministration be imposed for services that provide special benefits orprivileges to identifiable non-Federal recipients above and beyond thoseaccruing to the public at large. The fee may be assessed either as a costpursuant to an established schedule or as a share of the cost to the performingbureau or office as determined by a formal accounting system.A detailed analysis of the processing costs of the Bureau for mining claimrecordation documents indicated that in Fiscal Year 1987 each claim forwhich an affidavit of assessment work (or notice of intent to hold) wasfiled required an expenditure of $7.42. The initial recordation of a claimcost the Bureau $10.13. Because there is a benefit to the public, as wellas to the mining claimants themselves, from the maintenance of these records,a portion of the recordation program costs should not be recovered fromfiling fees. Based on an analysis of public versus mining claimant benefits,$5.00 per claim for annual filings and $10.00 per claim for initial recordationwas determined to be the appropriate cost recovery fees that approach butdo not exceed actual costs.The law and its implementing policies allow for exemptions from user fees,but the Bureau has been unable to justify exempting the mining claim recordationprogram from service charges. In fact, the General Accounting Office andthe Department of the Interior's Office of the Inspector General have criticizedthe Bureau in at least 9 reports and letters in the last 5 years for havingno, or very low, service charges for most of its programs. At least 2 reportsand 1 letter have focused on the mining recordation program.The Bureau's processing costs are higher than those of the County Recorder.The County Recorder receives a location certificate or affidavit of assessmentwork and places the entire page, undifferentiated, into a book. In contrast,the Bureau, as the official recordkeeper of the United States for publiclands, receives a location certificate, adjudicates it for land statusand legal requirements, and then enters it into the Bureau's data processingsystem. A separate file must be maintained for each claim. Annual filingsof assessments of work and notices of intent to hold mining claims areadjudicated for ownership changes and numbers of claims or sites filed.Separate copies are made for each mining claim or site listed, and eachautomated record must also be updated. The County Recorder is simply filinga record; the Bureau is processing and recording many changes to a publicland record. The additional requirements on the Bureau as a Federal landrecords agency mean that its processing costs are clearly not comparableto those of the County Recorder. The category 2 group of comments argued that the County Recorder operateson a per page basis and that the Bureau ought to operate on the same basis.The Bureau of Land Management queried County Recorder Offices in the westernStates before presenting this proposal for public comment. In at leastsix States_Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah_thefee for recording affidavits of assessment work is charged on a per-claimbasis, as opposed to a per-document basis. For example, Utah counties charge$5 for an affidavit of assessment work plus 50 cents for each claim afterthe first. Although the Bureau could operate on a per-page basis, thisprocedure would not always recover the costs of processing the document.Some annual filings, for example, contain up to 100 claims or sites perdocument, and the Bureau is required to adjudicate each claim or site asa separate action and separately enter each into the appropriate case file.The same situation applies to transfers of interest. Charging on a per-pagebasis would be equivalent, in effect, to giving volume discounts to filerswho have multiple claims even though each claim required separate processing.These entities would be charged the same amount as an individual filingone claim. Because the Bureau must recover its processing costs equitably,each filer must be charged on a per-claim, rather than a per-document,basis.The category 3 comments suggested that service charges on annual filingsbe imposed on a sliding scale. Sliding scale fees increase the time ofadministration of individual claims and encourage the filing of fewer documents.The combination of increased administration time and reduced filings wouldresult in revenues that do not recover administrative costs or that wouldshift the majority of the burden of paying for administering the programto the small miner with only a few claims. To ensure that small businessesdo not shoulder an inappropriate share of the burden, fees must be on aper-claim basis. Alternatively, the fees could increase with the numberof claims held per claimant so that large entities holding many claimswould pay a higher per-claim share. This idea was rejected as being inequitable.The category 4 comments suggested discounts for various select groups whouse the program, such as small miners or senior citizens. These discountswould significantly increase administrative costs because the special groupswould have to be identified initially and then reviewed annually as thefilings are made. The reduced revenues could result in failure to recoveradministrative costs. The proposal would also present numerous practicalproblems because of the difficulties of defining the special groups. Forinstance, the term ``small miner'' could include those individuals or businesseswith a ``few'' claims or those with small, active operations. The term``active'' could also present difficulties because the term could includeonly currently active operations, those active during a certain periodwithin the last 3 to 5 years or some other arbitrary standard.The category 5 comments supported the proposals as written. Some in thegroup expressed support for the idea that the increased revenues shouldremain in the States where they are generated to improve administrationof the mining program. This proposal can be implemented to some extentbecause language in the Fiscal Year 1989 Interior Appropriations Act authorizesthe Bureau to place the fees collected by this rulemaking into a specialno-year reimbursable account and not into the General Fund. The funds ina no-year account are not returned to the Treasury at the end of the fiscalyear. The money is carried over in the account into subsequent fiscal yearsto be spent as needed. The legislation further requires that all fees collectedby this fee schedule and returned to the Bureau in Fiscal Year 1989 andlater years be spent only in the Mining Law Administration Program to improvethe Bureau's record system and to expand and improve its overall activitiesin the mining law administration program. Because of the close linkageto the cost generating activities in each State, the funds generated inany State will likely to be returned to that State. It is not feasibleto mandate annual accounting or budget requirements in the regulations,however.One of the correspondents supporting the service charges based her supportupon the canceled check serving as evidence that the service charges hadbeen paid and that the Bureau had received the documents sent. The Bureauwould take this suggestion one step further and strongly encourage claimholdersto send in their annual filings by certified mail with a return receiptrequested, further protecting them against loss of their claims becauseof alleged losses of the annual filing documents by the Bureau after theirreceipt from the U.S. Mail. A return receipt card may serve as evidencethat the documents were received on time, overturning the presumption ofregularity in the processing of Bureau records. One comment estimated that10 percent of the notices sent were lost in the mail.The Bureau also strongly encourages claimholders to use the serial numbersof the claims for which filings are made each year on the filings themselves.This practice will reduce the number of incorrect credits given for paymentsmade for the mining claims and will prevent a claim from being lost dueto confusion over similar claim names or owner surnames.The category 6 comments supported greatly increased filing fees to permitthe Bureau to reclaim lands disturbed by previous mining actions and tooperate a thorough enforcement/bonding program. The fees suggested wereup to 1,000 percent above those proposed.The law does not permit an agency to recover more than its actual costs.Fees collected in excess of expenditures are legally considered a tax.The Bureau has no power to tax individuals or groups without express Congressionallegislative authority. Because the Bureau does not have taxing authority,this proposal cannot be adopted.One additional proposal in this section drew comments. This proposal wasthe provision that, after June 1, 1989, any filings not accompanied bythe appropriate filing fee would be considered fatally defective and wouldbe returned to the sender without further action. The result would be thatthe claim was considered abandoned. Some comments suggested that a graceperiod be given to ``cure'' the defect of the lack of a filing fee or ofthe right amount of a fee. The comments stated that no fee or an incorrectfee should be correctable without the disastrous consequence of losinga claim with no right of appeal. Based on these comments, the final rulemakingcontinues a 30-day grace period for curing the defect of no fee or an insufficientfee until January 1, 1991. After that date, by which time claimants shouldbe accustomed to the requirement, filings accompanied by insufficient orno fees will be refused by the Bureau. This proposal has been renumberedas 43 CFR 3833.1-4 to avoid confusion between the fees mentioned in 43CFR 3833.1-3 and the date when non-payment of fees becomes a non-curabledefect.43 CFR 3833.2The proposed rulemaking amended 43 CFR 3833.2-1 to reflect the fact thatnew mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites could not be located inunits of the National Park System. One comment supported the proposal.Several others stated that the proposal was not necessary because it duplicatedprovisions of the regulations relating to the National Park Service at36 CFR Part 9. In addition, a few argued that units of the National ParkSystem should be open to mineral location and development.The final rulemaking retains the language of the proposed rulemaking. TheMining in the Parks Act of September 28, 1976 (90 Stat. 1342), prohibitsmineral location and development in units of the National Park System.Therefore, the suggestion that units of the National Park System be opento mineral location and development cannot be adopted. The intent of theregulations is to reinforce the statutory prohibition against mineral locationin National Parks. The regulatory provisions of the National Park Servicerelevant to the mining laws are referenced in these regulations to assistprospectors and miners who might not have access to or knowledge of regulationsrelating to the National Park Service.Two comments noted an ambiguity in language at 43 CFR 3833.2-2(b) withrespect to the phrase ``between January 1, 1978, and October 22, 1979.''The correspondents could not determine whether or not the beginning andending dates were included. The final rulemaking changes the language toclarify that the beginning and ending dates are included in the provision.Two comments responded to the proposed language in 43 CFR 3833.2-2(b) requiringthat notices of intention to hold or evidence of annual assessment workbe filed on or before December 30 of each calendar year after 1979. Thecomments suggested December 31 as an alternative date. The final rulemakingretains the December 30 date for filing because that date is set by theFederal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.One of the comments pointed out that notices of intention to hold millsites and tunnel sites are not filed with County Recorders. Notices ofintention to hold mining claims are the only notices filed with CountyRecorders. The final rulemaking changes the language of andSection;3833.2-2(c)to reflect this fact.43 CFR 3833.4A few comments addressed the proposal in this section to make the failureto file information required by a decision of the authorized officer acause for voiding, and considering abandoned, a mining claim, mill site,or tunnel site. The correspondents suggested that the information failureshould be considered a curable defect and that the decision should be appealable.The language of the final rulemaking makes the suggested change and allowsindividuals to appeal the voiding of claims and sites for failure to fileinformation requested in a decision. If the Bureau is upheld on appeal,the claim would be conclusively deemed abandoned and void.43 CFR 3833.5The proposed rulemaking eliminated the so-called ``diligent search'' requirement,whereby the Bureau made a thorough search to find the whereabouts of amining claimant before administratively taking adverse action on the claimholder'sclaim. The final rulemaking eliminates the diligent search requirementfor administrative decisions of the authorized officer but adds languageto clarify that the diligent search requirement continues for mineral contestactions. This language is added in response to 3 comments, which addressedthe possible elimination of the requirement for a ``diligent search'' formineral contests.43 CFR 3852.2Numerous comments addressed this section, which would impose a servicecharge of $50 on petitions for the deferment of annual assessment work.Eight comments opposed the service charge as being a hardship on smallminers and suggested that Congress appropriate the money to administerthe mining program through appropriations. Six comments supported the proposal.The actions involved in processing a petition for deferment of annual assessmentwork are as follows: A land law examiner receives the petition, evaluatesit by examining the facts and law in the matter, and then issues a decisiongranting or denying the petition. The Bureau's estimate of the actual timespent by a land law examiner in processing a petition for deferment costsapproximately $25 per petition. The proposed $50 fee is reduced to $25by this final rulemaking to reflect the approximate costs of processingthis type of document. As was discussed under 43 CFR 3833.1-3 above, theBureau is obligated by statute and policy to recover the costs of administeringits programs. This final rulemaking therefore adopts a service charge of$25 for each petition for deferment of assessment work.43 CFR 3862.1-2The proposed rulemaking increased the filing fee for a patent applicationfrom $25 to $250 per application and from no fee to $50 for each additionalclaim or site in the application. There were 24 comments on the section,with six supporting the increase and 18 opposed. Those opposing the increasestated that it was a hardship on small miners, that it was too high, orthat it should only be collected if the patent was granted.The proposed fee increase is another cost recovery measure. The fee increaseis not unreasonable, considering the costs of providing the benefits obtainedin the patent process, required by law to be recovered. Under the GeneralMining Law of 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the mineral industry could obtain a mineral patent tothe lands under the mining claim or site, a deferment of assessment work,and a forum to challenge rival locators over rights of discovery or themineral character of the lands.The Bureau, in order to fulfill the responsibility of the Secretary ofthe Interior to grant or deny these claimed or asserted rights, maintainsa staff of Land Law Examiners, sometimes called adjudicators, in each StateOffice, and mineral examiners in each district or area office.The land law examiners process patent applications by assuring that allrequired title work complies with Departmental standards, that the properaffidavits of compliance are submitted, that the mineral survey is in order,and that the application has been advertised in the legal section of localnewspapers. If all the preceding requirements are met, the Bureau issuesthe first half of the mineral entry final certificate.After the mineral entry final certificate is issued, the mineral examinervisits the mining claim or site covered by the application. The examinermaps the geology, samples the mineral deposits, and verifies the mineralsurvey and improvements upon the mining claim or site. The informationcollected by the mineral examiner is then evaluated to determine if themining claim contains an economically extractable mineral commodity. Ifso, the examiner recommends that the patent issue. If not, the examinerrecommends that a mineral contest action be initiated against the miningclaims in the administrative law court of the Department of the Interior.A hearing is held before an Administrative Law Judge to determine whetherthe claims are valid or null and void.The Bureau incurs processing costs whether or not the patent is granted.Therefore, the final rulemaking does not adopt the suggestion that thefee be imposed only if the patent is granted.
