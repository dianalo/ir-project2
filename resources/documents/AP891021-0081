Delegates from 39 nations at the biennial Antarctica Treatymeeting agreed late Friday to call a meeting next year to discuss``comprehensive environmental measures'' for the icy continent,including a French-Australian proposal for a nature reserve there.   The United States and Britain lead opposition to the proposal,urging support instead for an international minerals treaty thatwould permit regulated mining in Antarctica. France and Australiahave refused to sign the treaty, blocking it from taking effect.   Tucker Scully, head of the U.S. delegation, said he wassatisfied with the compromise outcome of the Paris meeting, whichlasted two weeks.   ``We were not prepared to accept any proposal that predicted theoutcome of the next meeting or ran counter to our position,''Scully said.   Under the compromise, two meetings have been called for nextyear _ one to discuss environmental measures and one to considerproposals for establishing accident liability under the miningconvention.   When and where the meetings will take place was not decided,although Chile has offered to be host.   The next general Antarctica Treaty meeting will be in WestGermany in 1991.   Cousteau, the 79-year-old adventurer known for his televisionspecials and environmental activism, said his foundation wouldcontinue to seek signatures on petitions urging permanentprotection for Antarctica.   He told a news conference he plans to pursue his campaign in histravels to the United States in mid-November, to Argentina inDecember, to Chile next April and to Britain at a date not yet set.   Cousteau said he hoped next year's meeting on environmentalprotection in Antarctica would have ``a more active participationof political authorities, not just the bureaucrats.''   French Environment Minister Brice Lalonde, at a separate newsconference, said he thought public pressure could change the U.S.government's stance.   ``When I consider the state of mind of a large part of theAmerican population, I think the position of the United States canchange,'' Lalonde said.   Environmental groups called the outcome of the Paris meeting asuccess.   ``This is a victory for common sense and the environment,''Greenpeace International spokeswoman Lena Hagelin said in astatement. ``We now have the momentum to begin the negotiation of asuccessful new environmental regime.''</TEXT></DOC>
