The administrative fine on Piedmont Quilting Corp. of Walhalla,S.C., is the largest under the 1986 law that contains criminal andcivil penalties for knowingly employing illegal aliens, theImmigration and Naturalization Service said.   One INS official said working conditions for three children``almost bordered on bondage.''   The agency's announcement came a day after the company and 11officers and managers were indicted in Greenville, S.C., on federalcriminal charges related to the hiring of 117 illegal aliens fromMexico and Peru.   The administrative fine covers the employment of 85 illegalaliens, including a 12-year-old boy, INS said. The fine also coversthe company's failure to comply with procedures to verify that morethan 400 employees were not illegal aliens, it said.   ``This is in defiance of the congressional mandate to preventillegal aliens form obtaining employment in this country,'' INSCommissioner Gene McNary said in a statement.   McNary said the agency's action ``should be a clear sign tothose who have any doubts that the Immigration and NaturalizationService is strongly committed to enforcing the employer sanctions''in the 1986 law.   The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigation ofconditions at the company that included placement of an INSundercover agent as a plant employee, said Thomas P. Fischer,director of the agency's district office in Atlanta.   When INS agents raided the plant last July 17, they found threeMexican boys, two aged 15 and another 12, working on the plant,Fischer said in a telephone interview.   ``It almost bordered on bondage when you look at the age ofthese people,'' he said. ``They were being paid in cash, there wasno documentation.''   The indictment filed Tuesday charged that Piedmont Quiltingknowingly hired and recruited illegal aliens for employment,Assistant U.S. Attorney David Stephens said Tuesday in Greenville.   Indicted on that charge were company owner Alfred Mizhir, 55;his wife, Gail Mizhir, 30, both of Spring Lake, N.J.; and nineother individuals, including several Hispanic legal employees ofthe plant.   Piedmont Quilting's attorney has said the illegal alienspresented the company with false documentation in order to gethired.   Federal agents raided the company last July in what was calledthe biggest crackdown on the employment of illegal aliens outsidesouth Florida.   The indictment also includes 117 counts of harboring illegalaliens. Those charges are against the company, its owners and thesame individuals named in the first count.   Two additional counts charge the company, its owners and plantemployees Eugene Scarpa of Greenville and Mary Hill of Seneca,S.C., with making false statements on quarterly wage reports.   Establishing a practice of hiring illegal aliens carries amaximum fine of $3,000 per alien plus six months' imprisonment,Stephens said.   The penalty for harboring illegal aliens and for making falsestatements on quarterly reports is up to five years imprisonmentand $250,000 in fines per count, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
