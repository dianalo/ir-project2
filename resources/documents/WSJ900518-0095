(See related editorial:&quot;Darker Forces Behind Romania's `Front'&quot; -- WSJ May 18, 1990)The National Salvation Front, the main force in ousting theCeausescus last December and now in control of the&quot;transitional&quot; government, seems to have made sufficientarrangements to keep itself in power.   We are great believers in the democratic process andtherefore careful about challenging anything that looks to bea fair vote. But we also weren't born yesterday and are wellaware that communist countries have been having elections foryears, with highly predictable outcomes. You can't beatsomebody with nobody and the Front called elections early tosharply reduce the chances for opposition parties to organizethemselves.</LP><TEXT>   The Front would appear to have had no organizationalproblems of its own. As Mr. Keresztes reports, its leadersseem to have been far better prepared to unseat Ceausescuthan appeared to be the case at the time, when most of theworld assumed that the uprising was spontaneous. Havingaccomplished that, the Front seems also to have drawn heavilyon the Ceausescu bureaucratic, military and policeinfrastructure for purposes of operating a provisionalgovernment. So while it may have appeared that Romaniansoverthrew communism, they appear to have been left with a lotof the same people who were in places of power before theoverthrow.   There is a message in that for everyone who thinks thatthe path of European democracy will be an easy one. Afterbloody events of the type that took place in Romania inDecember, it is no longer politic for a Romanian to callhimself a Communist. Similar disavowals have occurred inHungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany despite morepeaceful transitions. But individuals who have held positionsof power in Communist regimes don't just disappear. Nor arethey necessarily changed overnight into democrats andfree-marketers.   President Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua, for example, islearning that even after you defeat Communists in a freeelection, their adherents can still cause a lot of troublethrough strikes and obstruction of government policies.   We hope not, but it is possible that Romania isexperiencing the most serious manifestation of thatphenomenon that we have yet seen -- an entire government thatdisavows communism but retains many of the previousgovernment's personnel and characteristics.   Romanian politics are relatively primitive, so the giveand take of democratic politics may yet have to be learned.If so, those violent scenes that flared across the world's TVscreens last December may well be repeated.</TEXT></DOC>
