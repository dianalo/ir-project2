De Lorean, the controversial former auto executive, has apparently cleared another major legal hurdle after reaching a settlement with a trustee in bankruptcy court here.    The agreement, reached Tuesday night, could clear Mr. De Lorean of the largest piece of civil litigation pending against him in the U.S. Since 1984, Mr. De Lorean has been acquitted in two separate criminal trials on charges of cocaine smuggling and diversion of corporate funds.    As part of the agreement in the five-year-old De Lorean Motor Co. bankruptcy-law case, Mr. De Lorean has consented to pay the trustee more than $9.3 million, in two installments, by Jan. 31, 1989. The bankruptcy court, after hearing arguments from creditors, must still approve the settlement, and a decision is expected within 45 days.    The lead attorney for the creditors declined to comment on the proposed settlement. The major creditors include the government of Britain, where De Lorean Motor built a plant, and the French auto maker Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, which was a supplier.    Mr. De Lorean said in an interview that he now is clear of any major legal complaints in the U.S. One attorney close to the case suggested, however, that any creditors that are dissatisfied with the proposed settlement could file new lawsuits. And Mr. De Lorean still could face litigation in Europe.    Despite the required payments, Mr. De Lorean portrayed the proposed settlement as a victory, saying that he gets ownership of various assets and various payments owed to him, as well as patents and licenses. His company manufactured a stainless steel, gull-wing sports car. His attorney, Mayer Morgenroth, estimated Mr. De Lorean would walk away from the settlement with about $30 million in assets.    But Robert Weiss, attorney for the trustee, expressed skepticism about that claim. &quot;People can characterize the transaction any way they want,&quot; he said. &quot;But when we started out this case, my client didn't have $9.3 million. Now we're at the end of the case, and we have an absolute commitment, well-collateralized.&quot; The trustee holds Mr. De Lorean's New York apartment and the assets of a Utah company as protection for the payment.    Though Mr. De Lorean would no longer be involved with the bankruptcy-law case if the settlement went through, Mr. Weiss said the trustee would pursue claims against other parties -- including the Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. accounting firm, and other former officers and affiliates of De Lorean Motor. He added that those claims exceed the more than $9.3 million secured from Mr. De Lorean. Mr. Weiss said creditors in the case claim they are owed about $100 million -- a total Mr. De Lorean disputes. </TEXT></DOC>
