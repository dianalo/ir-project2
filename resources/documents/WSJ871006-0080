In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Bregman Partners of Toronto said it and its co-investors hold 1,062,300 Multifoods shares. The Belzberg family of Canada owns 50% of Bregman Partners.    The filing said the investors were considering various options, which may include seeking control of the company, launching a tender offer or exchange of stock, or initiating a proxy contest. In July, Louis and Michael Bregman filed plans with other federal regulators to acquire as much as 24.9% of Multifoods' stock.    Bregman Partners also disclosed in the latest filing that the Bregmans had met in February with Multifoods executives to explore a possible sale of the company but that no specific proposal resulted. The filing said, however, that management expressed an interest in hearing of their ideas about the company, &quot;including the possibility of its acquisition.&quot;    Multifoods officials couldn't be reached for comment last night, but in response to the earlier Bregman filing, the company had said its shareholders would be best served if Minneapolis-based Multifoods remained independent. </TEXT></DOC>
