(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of people filled a schoolauditorium Friday night to remember with prayer and hymns the 10victims of Wednesday's Pyro Mining Co. disaster.   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said Kentuckians in general, and thefamilies of Pyro Mining Co. miners in particular, ``share in theimmense grief.''   ``Tragedies like this one ... make us mindful of the fragilenature of the thread that holds us together,'' Wilkinson said duringthe service at Union County High School near this western Kentuckycommunity.   The auditorum, with seating for 700, appeared to be nearlyfilled. A large wreath with yellow mums and white carnations backedthe podium onstage, with more flowers and ferns and a candle foreach of the victims in the foreground.   An American flag was at one side of the stage and the crowd sang``Amazing Grace.''   In the investigation of William Station mine, near Wheatcroft,was delayed as officials of Pyro and state and federal agenciesattempted to clear explosive levels of methane that persisted aroundthe explosion site.   Investigators entered the mine Friday afternoon in an attempt toreduce the hazardous methane levels.   Officials of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administrationapproved, with modifications, a company plan for reducing methanelevels, said Kathy Snyder, spokeswoman for MSHA. If the plan issuccessful, officials will remain underground and the probe willbegin, she said.   Earlier Friday, the head of a public-interest law firm said Pyroand federal authorities failed to prevent the disaster, even thoughthere were plenty of warning signs.   This year, federal inspectors briefly shut down the WilliamStation Mine because of ``imminent dangers,'' said J. DavittMcAteer, executive director of the Occupational Safety and HealthLaw Center.   Pyro reported 267 accidents at the underground mine since 1985,but failed to report several others, McAteer said.   Last year, for example, an MSHA audit of mine records revealedPyro did not report eight accidents at William Station, seven ofwhich forced workers to miss work, McAteer said. Accidents also wentunreported the two previous years, he said.   Ed Calman, a Pyro spokesman, refused to discuss the company'ssafety record. He said Pyro would reserve further comment untilcompany, state and federal officials completed their investigationof the accident, which was expected to take several weeks.   McAteer said MSHA was too lenient on Pyro after it discoveredblatant safety violations at William Station.   He said William Station had a coal-dust explosion in September1988, which injured two miners, and a methane ignition three monthslater, which injured no one. In 1985, one miner was electrocuted atthe mine and another died in an explosion, he said.   The following year, another miner died at William Station,although McAteer said the report submitted to MSHA by the companydidn't specify a cause of death.   MSHA spokesman Frank O'Gorman, who could not immediately verifythat Pyro failed to report some accidents, denied McAteer's claimthat his agency did not properly police Pyro was ``totally false.''</TEXT></DOC>
