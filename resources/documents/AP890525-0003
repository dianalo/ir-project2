Communist Party and East European sources said Wan Li, the headof China's legislature who also is associated with the liberalcamp, was detained in Shanghai after returning from a trip to theUnited States.   The reports, which could not be officially confirmed, furthersupported recent indications that party hardliners, led by seniorleader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng, have taken command in thecurrent power struggle.   There also have been signs in the official media thatconservatives have been winning the battle for control of China,most recently an appearance by Li on nationwide television in whichhe defended his martial law crackdown in Beijing.   Sources said Zhao, one of the architects of China's economicreforms, was stripped of power and was under house arrest. Hismovements were being restricted.   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman insisted Thursday that Zhao wasstill the party general secretary. But he has not been seen orheard from since May 20, when Premier Li declared martial law inBeijing and ordered troops to restore order in the capital.   A government source also said President Yang Shangkun, a Dengally, delivered a speech Thursday that strongly criticized Zhao forhis activities during the current pro-democracy student movementthat triggered the political crisis.   Yang, speaking to members of the party Politburo, retiredrevolutionary leaders and Beijing delegates of the NationalPeople's Congress, or legislature, said Zhao's actions ``had a verybad effect'' on the nation.   Yang said Zhao added to the disturbances with his actions, whichincluded expressing sympathy for the goals of the students andguaranteeing the students would not face reprisals.   Students initially were calling for a dialogue with thegovernment to discuss corruption and sweeping political changes.Since martial law was declared, they have demanded the ouster ofPremier Li and Deng.   A day before martial law was declared, Zhao and Li went tostudent-occupied Tiananmen Square to talk to students on a hungerstrike for democratic reform.   But whereas Li left after a few minutes, Zhao, with tears in hiseyes, made an impassioned speech calling for conciliation betweenthe government and the students.   Yang also said the People's Liberation Army, prevented fromentering Beijing by tens of thousands of citizens who have blockedroads and set up barricades, would eventually move in to assumemilitary control of the streets.   But he said the army would stay out for the time being ``inorder not to worsen the situation.''   The 81-year-old president also indicated that Communist Partymembers who have participated in the popular uprising will bepunished.   The government will continue to acknowledge that the studentmovement is patriotic, he said, ``but as for the others, they werecontrolled by a small band and will be suppressed.''   Thousands of party members from state-run news organizations,research institutes, ministries and factories have joined thedemonstrations. Many have joined the common call for theresignations of Premier Li and Deng.   Two sources said National People's Congress chairman Wan Li wasbeing held in Shanghai after being prevented from returning toBeijing on Thursday.   While in Canada and the United States, Wan had praised thestudents as leading a patriotic movement and urged a peacefulresolution to the standoff between the government and the students.   He cut short his trip and returned to China early Thursday. Theofficial Chinese press said he was staying in Shanghai for``medical treatment.''   Sources said the fate of Hu Qili, who recently was reported tohave backed Zhao, was less clear. Some said he was under housearrest. Others said only that it appeared he was in trouble. Hu, inaddition to sitting on the Politburo Standing Committee, is incharge of propaganda work in the party.   Premier Li made his first public appearance Thursday sincedeclaring martial law six days ago.   Appearing confident and relaxed at a welcoming ceremony forthree new ambassadors, Li said that ``anyone with common sense''should realize the army could enter Beijing if it wanted to.   ``But our government is a people's government and our army is apeople's army,'' state-run television news showed Li telling theambassadors from Mexico, Burma and Liberia.   He said the troops would enter the city after citizensunderstood the reason for the martial law order. He did notelaborate.   More than 100,000 workers and intellectuals, meanwhile, defiedLi's martial law crackdown for the second time this week andmarched Thursday in a sea of banners, calling for freedom and theresignation of Li and Deng.   In another sign that Zhao had lost out to Li, state-run radioreported that 27 out of 29 provinces have backed the martial laworder. Already, six out of China's seven military regions haveexpressed support for the crackdown. Only the Beijing military areahas been silent.   A shrill letter, published in all major newspapers and broadcaston the radio and television Thursday, further indicated that themilitary was closing ranks around Li.   The letter by the army Headquarters of General Staff and GeneralPolitical Department strongly supported Li's hardline position.   ``If we let their plot succeed, then the results of 10 years ofstruggle to reform China ... will be for naught,'' it said.   The protests are the biggest spontaneous political movement inCommunist China's 40-year history. Li's hard-line stance apparentlyreflects the views of Deng, who has tried to reduce centralcontrols of China's economy but refuses to relax tight politicalcontrol.   Troops remained poised on Beijing's outskirts Thursday, but nonehave openly entered the central districts. Hundreds of thousands ofcitizens surrounded their trucks and threw barricades acrossstreets to keep them out. After days of standoff, most of thetroops pulled into military and other compounds.   A circular from the State Council, China's cabinet, saidstudents forced their way onto trains to Beijing, hindering effortsto end turmoil in the capital and disrupting rail operations. Tensof thousands of students have poured into the city over the pastfew weeks from as far away as Kasgar near China's northwesternborder.   The State Council also sent a letter to troops expressing hopethey ``will overcome the difficulties confronting them (and)successfully impose martial law.''   Under government regulations, foreign reporters are banned fromconducting interviews on the street and in schools, governmentoffices, factories and other places.   In Washington, the State Department said the Voice of Americaadded two Chinese language frequencies to compensate partially forthree frequencies that Chinese authorities began jamming Monday.   State-run media said China's Red Cross urgent appealed forstudents to leave Tiananmen Square to avoid deteriorating healthconditions there.</TEXT></DOC>
