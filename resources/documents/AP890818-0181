U.S. Attorney Benito Romano made the announcement Thursday aftera top trader at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., Robert M. Freeman, said hewould plead guilty to mail fraud as part of an agreement withprosecutors.   ``In hindsight, we would have been better advised not to proceedwith the arrests at such an early stage of the investigation,''Romano said.   The charges initially were brought by then-U.S. Attorney RudolphGiuliani and frequently have been cited as an example of overzealouswhite-collar prosecution by Giuliani, now a candidate for New YorkCity mayor.   Freeman was arrested with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. trader RichardWigton and ex-Kidder trader Timothy Tabor in February 1987, anindirect result of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal thatshook Wall Street three months earlier.   Freeman and Wigton were seized in their offices as stunnedcolleagues watched. Wigton was led away in handcuffs.   The government voluntarily dropped the initial charges againstthe trio in May 1987 after a judge rejected requests by prosecutorsfor more pretrial preparation time. The U.S. Attorney's officeindicated at the time that it planned another indictment, but newcharges were not brought.   Romano told a news conference Thursday the government had closedits investigation of Wigton and Tabor without bringing any charges.   ``It's about time they did,'' said Wigton's attorney, Stanley S.Arkin. ``They wrongly and unjustly arrested the man and charged himand left him in a state of uncertainty for two years. ... Thegovernment ought to apologize to him.''   A statement released by Tabor's attorney, Andrew M. Lawler,called Tabor's arrest ``a terrible misjudgment.''   ``That decision has caused Mr. Tabor incalculable personal andprofessional damage,'' he said. ``A thorough investigation wouldhave established, and indeed has established, that Mr. Tabor isinnocent of any wrongdoing.''   Freeman, 47, who also resigned as head of Goldman Sachs'arbitrage operation, said he decided to plea to end the ordeal of acriminal investigation that began 2{ years ago.   ``Life has become a nightmare for me and my family,'' Freemantold the firm in a letter. ``I have been unable to participate inthe firm's activities in a meaningful way.''   At an appearance before U.S. Magistrate Nina Gershon, Freemansaid he had agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud inconnection with trades involving the stock of Beatrice CompaniesInc. in early January 1986.   He is to formally enter his plea Sept. 5 before Judge PierreLeval.   The felony carries a maximum prison term of five years andprosecutors are seeking $1.86 million in fines.   The plea agreement caps a criminal investigation of Freeman'sactivities with Kidder and several other investment firms. Romanosaid Freeman probably will face civil charges filed by theSecurities and Exchange Commission.   Romano also said that under the plea agreement, Freeman is notrequired to cooperate in the government's investigation of WallStreet corruption. He would not comment on whether prosecutors wereseeking information from Freeman.   Freeman was implicated by former Kidder takeover strategistMartin Siegel, who had been fingered by Boesky as using illegalinsider information for stock trades.   Freeman said he only knew Siegel through business telephoneconversations. ``I never talked with Siegel with the idea ofinfluencing any trading decisions by him,'' he said in his letter.   ``The conversation with him ... regarding Beatrice certainly tookplace, and I should not have initiated trading after it,'' he said.   As head of arbitrage, the speculative buying and selling ofstock, Freeman said he invested heavily in Beatrice stock _ forGoldman Sachs as well as his personal account _ based on hisconfidence that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s debt-financedtakeover of Beatrice would succeed.   The government accused Freeman of trading stock on the basis ofillegal insider information from Siegel, who represented KohlbergKravis in the Beatrice deal. But Freeman said his only involvementwith Siegel was a phone conversation in which Siegel confirmedrumors that the deal faced difficulties.</TEXT></DOC>
