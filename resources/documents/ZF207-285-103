(planning).andO;Topic:     Business PlanningOutlook.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In Wake of DEC Deal, Mips To Shift StrategyandM;SUNNYVALE, Calif.andP;  -- For Mips Computer Systems officials, it had to feel abit like the classic starlet-is-discovered-and-make-it-big Hollywood film,but with a Silicon Valley twist.andM;After four successful but not particularly breathtaking years, Mipstechnology made it big-time this month as DEC introduced its fastest, mostpowerful desktop system to date based on Mips technology.andM;With that particular deal now well established, however, many industryobservers believe that Mips faces a critical question: What to do for anencore?andM;&quot;This is clearly the year for Mips to establish themselves on their own,&quot;said Jeff Canin, an analyst with San Francisco-based investment researchcompany Hambrecht and Quist.andM;Indications are that the company intends to do that by continuing its currenttechnology-licensing agreements while more aggressively pursuing its computeserver and other systems business.andP;  In 1988, approximately 62 percent ofMips' $39 million in revenue came from royalties and chip sales to companiessuch as Prime, Tandem, Silicon Graphics, Sumitomo and several others.andP;  Theother 38 percent of revenue came from sales of its own servers and othersystems.andM;In the coming year, however, Mips expects that ratio to reverse, so thatsystem sales will account for roughly two-thirds of revenue, and technologyroyalties for one-third, according to Beverly Jerman, director of corporatecommunications for Mips.andM;At the same time, Mips officials are predicting that 1989 revenues will morethan double those of 1988.andM;Several recent moves appear to have laid the groundwork for that transitionand growth.andP;  Mips announced this month that it has hired Apple's senior vicepresident of sales, Charles M. Boesenberg, to join Mips as executive vicepresident of marketing and president of a yet-to-be-named new business unit.andM;Part of Boesenberg's responsibilities will include overseeing the creation ofnew distribution channels for the company.andM;Industry analysts stand somewhat divided on what direction Mips should pursueto achieve its goals.andM;&quot;They're going to have to nail some niches,&quot; said Paul Cubbage, an analystwith Dataquest in San Jose.andP;  He said he foresees strong competition for theprocessor market from established companies such as Motorola and Intel andfrom start-ups entering with faster and less expensive processors.andP;  &quot;I don'tsee how they are going to get into the general systems market,&quot; Cubbage said.andM;The answer, he said, is to get in early and strong into some developing,narrowly defined markets, such as fiber optics.andP;  &quot;There are a lot of peoplewho win on niches, and a lot of people who win on value-add,&quot; he added.andM;Canin said he sees more potential for Mips in general systems, but does notsee that opportunity extending down to single-user workstations.andP;  There isgoing to be &quot;a very bloddy battle for the desktop this year,&quot; Canin said.andO;Trying to establish a market for a Mips-brand workstation, he said, &quot;would bea mistake.&quot;andM;On the other hand, Canin said, &quot;I think there's tremendous opportunity in themultiuser market.&quot;andP;  Mips' systems effort &quot;has benefited tremendously&quot; fromthe credibility gained with closing the DEC deal, Canin said.andP;  And thatcredibility, he said, could be used to sell a VAX alternative that wouldcompete with companies such as Pyramid and Sequent.andM;I don't see us trying to compete with Sun as a workstation company,&quot; saidRobert Miller, Mips chairman, president and chief executive officer, &quot;but Isee us competing with Sun in the relative pervasiveness of the Mipsarchitecture.&quot;andM;Mips' strategy, Miller said, &quot;would not be to aggressively go after theworkstation market....andP;  We would market [workstations] in a way thatcomplemented our product line for those who wanted binary compatibility withour servers.&quot;andM;While systems are sure to play a central role in Mips' plans this year, thecompany's semiconductor business should also continue to do well.andP;  Mips nowhas three semiconductor manufacturer partners, IDT, PerformanceSemiconductor, and LSI Logic.andP;  Jerman said Mips will announce two otherpartners within the quarter.andM;This year should also see the introduction of a new and even faster versionof its RISC processor and a new ECL processor, according to Nate Brookwood,and analyst with D.H.andP;  Brown Associates, an investment research company inTarrytown, N.Y.andM;James Mannos, director of strategic marketing for Mips, declined to discussspecific processors or technology, but did say, &quot;If I were to prognosticate,I'd say by the end of the year you'll see 20 Mips workstations and 50 Mipsservers.&quot;andP;  Whether those worksttions and servers would be produced by Mips orby companies using its technology, he did not say.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
