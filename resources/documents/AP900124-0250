The three-judge court cited errors by the trial judge, includingincorrect instructions to the jury, in overturning the 1987 verdict.   In a suit by investor Irving Backman, Boston attorney ThomasShapiro argued that Polaroid founder Edwin Land and companyexecutive Julius Silver sold stock in 1979 knowing that Polaroidstock was high at the time because of the undisclosed failure ofPolavision technology.   Polavision was a $68 million failure and was withdrawn from themarket in 1979.   Land and Silver settled with Backman out of court, but in July1987, a jury found Polaroid liable for damages to shareholdersequal to $9.75 a share.   A Polaroid spokesman said Tuesday the company had not seen theruling and could not comment. The Boston Globe said Shapiro was outof town and neither he nor Land, who is retired, could be reachedfor comment.</TEXT></DOC>
