North, who retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corpswith 20 years of active-duty service, has been drawing an annualmilitary pension of roughly $23,100 since leaving the corps almostexactly a year ago.   At the time of his retirement, North said he was leaving theservice in order to better prepare his defense against charges ofmisconduct stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.   On Thursday, the former National Security Council aide wasconvicted on three felony counts and cleared of nine others. Thejury found North guilty of shredding documents, accepting anillegal gratuity and one count of aiding and abetting in anobstruction of Congress.   North had been receiving his pension since he retired, said ArmyLt. Col Linda Dumoulin, a Pentagon spokeswoman.   But once the conviction becomes legally effective _ when thesecretary of the Navy is formally notified of it and the paperworkis completed _ North will lose his pension, she said.   ``Once the conviction goes into effect, whatever time that is,he loses his retired pay. I know he's been convicted, but I don'tknow exactly what time it takes effect, whether it's today ortomorrow, or whatever,'' she said.   If North wins on appeal, he will get the pension back and willbe given pay retroactively, she said.   Under federal law, a retired officer's pension is notjeopardized by just any felony conviction. Rather, it depends uponthe nature of the specific charge.   And according to Lt. Col. Fred Peck, a Marine Corps spokesman,only one of the charges on which North was convicted can result inloss of his pension _ the charge of destroying NSC records.   ``The conviction on that count requires the forfeiture by Northof his office; in other words, his status as a retired lieutenantcolonel in the Marine Corps,'' Peck said. ``And that means you losethe pension.''   Under normal procedures, Peck said the secretary of the Navywould issue an order directing revocation of North's pension oncehe's formally advised of the conviction.   Monthly pension payments will then be withheld, pending theresults of any appeal. Should North succeed with an appeal, hewould then be entitled to restoration of his pension and back pay.</TEXT></DOC>
