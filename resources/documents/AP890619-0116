The two sides met for five hours Monday in the latest round ofperiodic talks since the conflict erupted in 1986. Previous meetingshave not halted black-on-black violence that has killed more than1,500 people in the southeastern cities of Durban andPietermaritzburg.   Both organizations claim more than 1 million members and concedethey have little control over young supporters.   The groups said they will try to ``expose and isolate all thoseelements that we believe are actually engaged in this campaign ofpromoting violence amongst our people.''   The statement did not elaborate but is considered a reference towhite authorities and police who have made only a handful of arrestsdespite the hundreds of killings.   ``Our efforts must be directed toward uniting our people in a waywhich could decisively strike a blow against apartheid and not ourpeople,'' the statement said of South Africa's legal policy of racediscrimination.   Police in KwaZulu homeland said 26 blacks were killed over theweekend, including five slain en route to a Sunday prayer rallyaddressed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulus and head ofInkatha.   ``Black people are too busy squabbling amongst themselves,''Buthelezi told the crowd of 5,000, many carrying knobbed, woodenfighting sticks.   Homeland police gave no details of the killings, but SouthAfrican police reports indicated at least nine appeared politicallymotivated.   KwaZulu police said they are investigating reports that ``unkownwhite men'' were seen in a township where some deaths occurred.However, police said they have no evidence any whites were involveddirectly in the attacks.   The United Democratic Front and Inkatha both oppose apartheid,but the front is much more militant, favoring boycotts, sanctions,strikes and protests not endorsed by the relatively conservativeZulu organization.   The front accuses police of favoring Inkatha, a charge the policedeny.   Almost all the front's top leaders have been detained at varioustimes, and the organization is one of more than 30 anti-apartheidgroups officially banned last year, although it still conducts someactivities.   Some anti-apartheid activists accuse Buthelezi of collaboratingwith the white-led government by participating in the black homelandsystem. Buthelezi says he sees the homelands as an interim step toblack majority rule.   South Africa's 28 million blacks have no voice in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites maintain political and economiccontrol and have segregated schools, neighborhoods and hospitals.</TEXT></DOC>
