Basic properties of the fuzzy set theory which wereessential for its application to the ventilation control were explained,followed by description of presentation of the recognition for the airdistribution planning based upon measurements, presentation of apprehendedstatus using the fuzzy relationship, simulation of ventilation control,the language control rule based up on (LC rule), and automatic designof LC rule. The paper reports on the selection of an adequate numberof local fans according to the measurement of air flow rate with thetime lag taken into consideration. The air ventilation rate in the simulationwas determined by Liccfaci's equation for non-steady state. Results havedemonstrated the effectiveness of the fuzzy set formulation. An improvedsystem will be constructed for maintaining better security in mines bycombination of an adequate layout of sensors in the mine and combinedwith the fuzzy set theory.
