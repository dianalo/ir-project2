The sharp deterioration also triggered speculation that the Bank of England might sanction new interest-rate increases.    The government said the deficit in the current account, which measures trade in goods and services and certain unilateral transfers, ballooned to a seasonally adjusted #1.21 billion ($2.06 billion) last month from #728 million in April, surpassing the previous record of a #1.16 billion gap set in January. The figure was nearly double analysts' expectations and hit sterling and London share prices like a bomb. It knocked more than three pfennigs off sterling's value against the key West German mark, pushing it below 3.10 marks in late trading in London, and sheared 29.8 points off London's Financial Times 100 Share index, which closed at 1841.5.    &quot;We're in the grip of a domestic investment and consumer boom&quot; that is sucking in foreign imports, said Bill Martin, chief British economist for London-based securities firm Philips andamp; Drew. Another London economist, Ian Harwood of S.G. Warburg andamp; Sons, described the deficit as &quot;pretty scary&quot; and called it &quot;the black spot on the (United Kingdom's) economic landscape.&quot;    To cool demand and stabilize sterling, London analysts said, the British government this week might be forced for the fourth time in a month to nudge up British base interest rates -- this time by at least half a percentage point to 9.5%, and possibly by a full point to 10%. But the widely expected increase didn't materialize yesterday, and government spokesmen declined to comment on the interest-rate speculation.    Generally, government officials tried to play down the significance of the politically embarrassing deficit.    A Trade Department spokesman said the May figure was inflated by previously announced adjustments in the goverment's statistical tallies, and by a perhaps-temporary rise in imports of aircraft, precious stones, and other so-called &quot;erratic&quot; goods. At the Treasury, officials called the deficit large but not yet a matter of great concern. They argued that financing the deficit won't be difficult because foreign confidence in the British economy is strong and the deficit is small compared with Britain's large holdings of assets abroad.    But London market analysts, and opposition Labor Party politicians, weren't buying the government line yesterday. Warburg's Mr. Harwood called the import rise &quot;very much across the board,&quot; from consumer to industrial goods, while exports of oil and many other goods were down because of sterling's relative strength against other currencies. He forecast a big jump for the year in Britain's current-account deficit, to #10 billion from #1.56 billion in 1987.    Bryan Gould, Labor's trade spokesman in Parliament, called the figures &quot;appalling&quot; and said &quot;we now face a balance-of-payments crisis,&quot; according to Britain's Press Association.    The deficit was entirely in merchandise trade, which posted red ink of #1.71 billion in May compared with #1.23 billion in April. Merchandise exports fell to #6.48 billion in May from #6.79 billion in April, while imports rose to #8.19 billion from #8.02 billion.    As in prior months, Britain's trade in &quot;invisibles&quot; -- services, tourism, and other non-merchandise items -- was in the black. The invisibles surplus in May was estimated at #500 million, unchanged from April and up from #414 million in March. </TEXT></DOC>
