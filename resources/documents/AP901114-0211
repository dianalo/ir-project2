(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investors in the Taj Mahal CasinoResort and casino owner Donald Trump blame each other for breakingoff debt restructuring talks just before a $47.3 million paymentcomes due Thursday.   No new negotiations were scheduled after talks broke off Tuesdaybetween Trump and holders of $675 million in bonds used to financethe Taj Mahal, the most ostentatious casino in Atlantic City.   Wilbur Ross, senior managing director for New York-basedRothschild Inc. which is negotiating for bondholders, said they'rewilling to renew negotiations if Trump is reasonable.   ``It's up to them,'' Ross said in a telephone interview from NewYork. ``We're perfectly willing to return.''   But Ross said bondholders remain willing to take their chancesat throwing Trump into bankruptcy rather than accept the offerTrump made to restructure the money he owes. The bondholders aresecured, or first in line in any list of creditor demands, he said.   Trump has a 30-day grace period to make the payment afterThursday with failure opening up the prospect that the Taj Mahalcould be thrown into bankruptcy months after it opened April 2 asAtlantic City's newest and biggest casino.   Trump said in a news release Tuesday that the bondholdersrepresented by Rothschild Inc. presented unrealistic demands.   ``We saw no point in going forward,'' Trump said.``Unfortunately this case will be in court for many years tocome.''   Trump said numerous bondholders have contacted his NewYork-based Trump Organization seeking to deal apart from RothschildInc. Trump did not elaborate.   Calls to the Trump Organization seeking comment were referred tochief financial officer Stephen Bollenbach. Telephone messages leftfor Bollenbach were not immediately returned. But he was quoted inNew York-area newspapers today as saying he believed a compromisedeal could still be struck.   Ross said bondholders remain united.   ``An age-old strategy is to try to divide and conquer yourenemy,'' Ross said.   He said Trump failed to budge on four bondholder demands - theamount of interest that Trump would pay, whether excess cash in thecasino would be earmarked as supplemental interest for bondholders,the amount of equity that Trump would sacrifice in exchange forrestructured terms and bondholders' influence over a board ofdirectors.   Ross would not be more specific about the negotiating terms, butTrump said in a filing last month with the Securities and ExchangeCommission he would offer the bondholders 19.9 percent in thecasino.   The state Casino Control Commission is scheduled to hold ahearing Dec. 3   on the financial stability of Trump's three casinos, whichinclude the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Trump Castle CasinoResort By The Bay.   The commission scheduled the financial stability hearing afterapproving in August a $65 million emergency bank loan to TrumpCastle designed to stave off a default at that property.   All three casinos have suffered this year along with the entiregaming industry in Atlantic City. Gross gaming revenues at TrumpPlaza and Trump Castle plunged after the Taj Mahal opened.   The Taj Mahal has posted the city's highest gross gamingrevenues since gambling came in 1978. But the mammoth casino, whichcost $1 billion to build, has failed to make the $1.3 million a daythat analysts said it would need to break even on its debt-financedproperty.   Rothschild represents a steering committee of about 35 percentof the bondholder interests. The steering committee was elected byabout 85 percent of the bondholder interests, Ross said.</TEXT></DOC>
