ADLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The signing of a two-year contractbetween Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union has oneunion executive wondering how the company will fare in its new era.   ``The test will really come now as to the (Chrysler Chairman Lee)Iacocca management's ability to manage,'' UAW Vice President MarcStepp said Monday after the contract was signed at a ceremony.   ``It's been somewhat fortunate with a great deal of assistance,from workers, suppliers and from the economy,'' he said. ``... Nowthey're on their own.''   Stepp echoed a point made by UAW President Owen Bieber, who saidthe signing ceremony never would have been possible without greatsacrifice on the part of all involved with Chrysler over the lastnine years.   ``I think Chrysler is a good example where cooperation from theplant floor on up contributed immensely'' to saving the company,Bieber said.   Another sign that Chrysler is recovered from the financialproblems that pushed it toward bankruptcy in 1979 is the realignmentof the Chrysler-UAW contract with those at General Motors Corp. andFord Motor Co, Stepp said.   The common expiration date of national labor agreements at theBig Three gives the union an advantage in picking a company totarget for a pattern agreement. Stepp said Chrysler workers werehurt financially by being out of synch with GM and Ford, but underthe circumstances, there was no choice.   ``Many of the benefits the Chrysler workers would have gotten hadto go by the wayside because we had to work to save the company,''Stepp said.   ``They are back making profits and they are back on a levelplaying field as Lee points out. So they can get back to thebusiness of competing,'' he said.   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John said the two sidesrecognize Chrysler's mission.   ``I think we all realize we're in a very competitive ball game inthe future and that's going to result in good cooperative efforts tomake sure we stay in the ball game,'' he said.   The agreement covering 66,000 workers took effect May 16 afterbeing approved by just 54 percent of the covered workers. One unit,the skilled trades workers, voted down the agreement, but theirobjections were dealt with.   ``I don't think we should dwell on the question of percentage,''Bieber said. ``It's a question now of what happens from this pointforward.''   Chrylser and the UAW began early negotiations April 18 as a wayto calm rising tensions brought on by Chrysler's consideration of a$2 billion offer for its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiaryand the company's decision to close a 5,500-worker assembly plant inKenosha, Wis.   The tentative agreement was reached May 4 and eliminated thepossibility of a strike in September, which observers said wouldhave been likely because of the anger of rank-and-file workers overthe proposed Acustar sale and the Kenosha closing.   Bieber said the turmoil during negotiations and that 50 percentof the rank and file failed to vote during the ratification processcontributed to the low percentage of approval.</TEXT></DOC>
