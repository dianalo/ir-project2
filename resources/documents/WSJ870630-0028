Tony Coelho, California Democrat and House Majority Whip, describing a rising tide of congressional anger and resentment.    There are bipartisan demands in Congress that Japan and our North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, which receive most of the oil that passes through the Persian Gulf, should pay most of the U.S. Navy's added cost of protecting the region. Legislators complain that European politicians are upset about the proposed removal of part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent that protects them but aren't willing to pay more for their own defense. And lawmakers threaten to impose billions of dollars in fees and import duties on allies that don't pay their fair share of common defense costs.    The sharing of the defense burden is emerging as a potent 1988 political issue. Currently, a powerful neo-isolationist pull in Congress is focused mainly on trade legislation. But it appears that the trade issue may be eclipsed by the question of sharing the defense burden, which some experts link to the Reagan administration's overreaching in foreign policy and defense spending.    Arcane debates over sharing the defense burden once made most legislators' eyes glaze over. But now they've been energized by huge American budget deficits, trade deficits and soaring debts owed to foreigners. Critics claim the U.S. can't any longer afford to be the world's policeman, so lawmakers such as Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, are demanding that U.S. allies, which grew rich feeding off American markets under the American military umbrella, help foot more of the bills.    &quot;We have all the burdens of empire but none of the benefits,&quot; says Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. &quot;So we've got to say to the allies that we are no longer your protector. We're now equal partners.&quot;    &quot;Every time we start dealing with defense spending these days, people start asking why our allies don't spend as much proportionately as we do,&quot; adds Rep. Jim Courter (R., N.J.).    Lawmakers are searching for ways to ease the inevitable pain of austerity as the U.S. cuts back on its profligate ways. They also are irritated by lectures from allies about budget-balancing. So while Congress struggles to come up with $19 billion in new taxes to help shave the budget deficit, some legislators see a potential pot of $15 billion to $40 billion in &quot;user&quot; fees that they hope can be extracted from affluent allies.    &quot;If we're going to put the American people through the ringer, and if the allies want us to tighten our belts, then they have to be prepared that some of the belt-tightening is going to be on them,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political theorist.    The linkage between defense and trade deficits already is evident in efforts to promote commercial military sales. South Korea is shopping for several hundred helicopters and is considering bids from U.S., British and French companies. The U.S. chopper is the most expensive, but Commerce Department officials are leaning on the South Koreans, telling them that a U.S. purchase would be a good way to show they're serious about reducing their $7 billion trade surplus with the U.S., according to Pentagon officials.    In the face of congressional carping, the Pentagon defends the allies. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in a report to Congress in April, asserted that &quot;our allies continue to make a very substantial contribution to the common defense -- considerably more than they are often given credit for.&quot;    The Pentagon report says it's difficult to compare the defense costs of the U.S. and its allies. For instance, it notes, many NATO armies rely on conscripted manpower and, thus, their &quot;labor&quot; costs are lower than those needed in the U.S. to attract candidates to a volunteer force. Moreover, the report states, by certain measurements, such as the percentage of the population on active military duty, the allies bear a burden equal to that of the U.S.    Referring to the debate on Capitol Hill, a senior Defense Department official says: &quot;The best thing that can come out of this is that the allies will get nervous and take us seriously. The Hill is coming up with all kinds of silly stuff, and it's within their rights and capability to pass all kinds of nonsense.&quot;    Most of the burden-sharing bills being tossed into the legislative hopper probably won't become law soon. But their broad scope is a good barometer of the intensity of feeling the issue is generating.    Rep. Schroeder, for example, is the author of the Defense Protection Act. For allies, this measure would impose an import fee based on defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, or overall economic activity. The U.S., for instance, spends about 6.9% of its gross domestic product on defense while Japan spends only about 1%. So the levy on Japanese imports would be the difference, or about 5.9%. Similarly, the U.S. spends proportionately more than twice as much on defense as West Germany. Only Greece, the NATO member with the most abrasive relations with the U.S., spends a bigger percentage than Washington.    A measure sponsored by Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) would impose a user fee on allies for their share of the U.S. military protection in the Persian Gulf based on the amount of Persian Gulf oil they receive. Rep. Stark says that former Navy Secretary John Lehman estimates U.S. defense costs in the gulf at $40 billion annually. Under this plan, Japan would be charged $14 billion and NATO nations $20 billion. (A Navy spokesman says Mr. Lehman's estimate is a very rough number.) A similar measure proposed by Rep. J. Alex McMillan (R., N.C.) would extend this user-fee concept from the gulf to all U.S. costs incurred defending allies.    The standard ally-bashing measure, a threat to withdraw some of the 325,000 U.S. troops from Europe if the allies don't bear a larger share of the defense burden, hasn't been introduced this year. Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, says most members believe it wouldn't be appropriate to withdraw troops at the same time the U.S. is involved in negotiations with the Soviet Union over eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe.    Nevertheless, strong isolationist feelings are rising in Congress. When presidential aspirant and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole was asked last year about a proposal for a Marshall Plan for the Mideast, the Kansas Republican quipped: &quot;How about one for the Midwest?&quot;    ---   Total Defense Spending   (As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product for 1985)  Belgium                  3.0% Canada                   2.2 Denmark                  2.2 France                   4.1 W.
