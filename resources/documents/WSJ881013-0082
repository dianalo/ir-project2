The policy, which is immediately effective, revises the criteria the EPA must consider when registering pesticides for use. The intent is to register new, less dangerous products in hope that farmers will abandon the higher-risk pesticides. &quot;It ultimately means a safer food supply,&quot; a spokesman said.    The new guidelines would allow for the registration of pesticides if they leave residues that pose a cancer risk of no more than one in one million over a lifetime. Old guidelines varied, depending on whether the food treated by the pesticide would be sold raw or processed.    Environmentalists denounced the new policy, because the EPA has yet to revoke the registrations for the older, more carcinogenic pesticides.    &quot;It's perverse and not going to get us out of the real threat posed to us by pesticides,&quot; said Janet Hathaway, senior project attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a lobbying organization in Washington. The council said it is considering filing suit in federal court to contest the new policy. </TEXT></DOC>
