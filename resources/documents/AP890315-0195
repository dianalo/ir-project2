Aide Optimistic on New Refugee Proposals</HEAD><DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A senior U.N. official said Wednesday he isoptimistic a plan to stem the exodus of refugees from Vietnam willwin approval at a special U.N.-sponsored conference in June.   Sergio Vieira de Mello, director for Asia in the office of theU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, made the comment whileoutlining the plan endorsed at a meeting last week in Malaysia.   One aim of the proposal is to deter Vietnamese boat people by``making them think twice about risking their lives'', he said,referring to reports of piracy on the high seas.   Last year, more than 45,000 boat people landed in Southeast Asiancountries, compared with fewer than 30,000 in 1987.   Under the plan, emigres from Vietnam will no longer beautomatically granted refugee status. As of March 14, only those whoflee persecution are eligible for asylum and permanent resettlement.   Others who leave the country for economic reasons will beencouraged to return, said de Mello. At the same time, he said,efforts will be made to ``increase awareness'' among potentialemigrants in Vietnam of the dangers they risk leaving the countryillegally.   ``Along certain coasts, the push-off policy or, in morediplomatic terms, the redirection of boats to other countries ispractically systematic,'' he noted.   In addition there is to be a campaign to stress the advantages ofthe 10-year-old ``Orderly Departure Program,'' under which 23,000people were flown out of of Vietnam last year, most of them forresettlement in the United States and Australia.   De Mello said that figure is expected to double this year.   Negotiations are also under way to include in the program formerdetainees of Vietnamese ``reeducation camps.'' De Mello said that byU.N. standards, these people would have a ``legitimate claim to thestatus of refugees.''   The plan was endorsed last week by representatives from SoutheastAsian countries, China and the Soviet Union. An internationalconference to approve it is tentatively scheduled June 13 and 14 inGeneva.   China granted asylum to about 280,000 ethnic Chinese who flednorthern Vietnam in the late 1970s, when relations between the twoCommunist neighbors deteriorated. Many have been resettled on statefarms in southern China but have complained of hardship anddiscrimination.   In Hong Kong on Wednesday, about 150 Vietnamese refugees who fledto the British colony after being resettled in China staged ademonstration to protest plans to send them back to China, agovernment spokesman said.   The Vietnamese at the Green Island center climbed onto adormitory roof and shouted slogans protesting repatriation, saidGordon Tam, a spokesman for the Correctional Services Department.   One Vietnamese woman fell from the roof and was hospitalized,according to Tam, who said he had no information on her condition. </TEXT></DOC>
