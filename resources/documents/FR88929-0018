BackgroundOn May 21, 1980, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)issued its rule entitled Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records.29 CFR 1910.20; 45 FR 35212 <T3>et seq.</T3> (hereinafter ``Records Access'' rule). The rule imposedthree major obligations on employers. First, employers were required topreserve and maintain exposure and medical records pertinent to an employee'soccupational exposure to toxic substances or harmful physical agents. 29CFR 1910.20(d). Generally, employee exposure records and analyses basedon exposure or medical records were to be retained for thirty years. 29CFR 1910.20(d)(1)(ii) and (iii). Employee medical records were to be retainedfor the duration of employment plus thirty years. 29 CFR 1910.20(d)(1)(i). Second, throughout these time periods the employer was required to ensureaccess to pertinent exposure records by the exposed employee, fellow employeesexposed or potentially exposed to similar job hazards, designated employeerepresentatives, and OSHA. 29 CFR 1910.20(e). Access to medical recordswas also to be ensured to the employee who is the subject of the records,and to OSHA. Likewise, access to medical records was required to be ensuredto an employee's designated representative, such as the employee's collectivebargaining agent, but, because of the privacy interests involved, onlyif the employee has provided specific written consent for such access.29 CFR 1910.20(e)(2)(ii)(B); <T3>cf</T3>. andSection;1910.20(c)(10).Employee and designated representative access was to be provided at a reasonabletime, place, and manner, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days afterthe request is made. 29 CFR 1910.20(e)(1). OSHA access was required tobe provided immediately upon request, 29 CFR 1910.20(e)(3), but becauseof the personal privacy interests affected by access to medical records,OSHA's access to such records was further conditioned upon the agency'scompliance with the procedures and protections which were simultaneouslypromulgated as 29 CFR 1913.10. Third, upon entering into employment and annually thereafter, employeeswere to be informed by their employers of their rights under the regulationand of the requisite procedures for exercising those rights. 29 CFR 1910.20(g).In issuing the regulation, the Secretary considered its potential impacton trade secrets. 29 CFR 1910.20(f). Although disclosure upon request ofidentities of toxic substances, levels of exposure, and health status datawas required, the employer was allowed to delete any other trade secretdata which disclosed manufacturing processes or the percentage of a chemicalsubstance in a mixture. In addition, the provisions of the final rule permittedemployers to condition access to trade secrets upon basic written agreementsnot to misuse this information. On November 25, 1983 (48 FR 53280), OSHA promulgated its new final HazardCommunication standard, codified at 29 CFR 1910.1200. The standard requireschemical manufacturers and importers to assess the hazards of chemicalswhich they produce or import, label containers with the hazards of thechemicals they ship, and supply downstream users with material safety datasheets. All employers in the manufacturing sector, SIC Codes 20 through39, are to provide information to their employees concerning the hazardsof chemicals the employees are exposed to. These employers must not removehazard labels from containers, must save and provide employee access tomaterial safety data sheets, and train employees in the hazards of thechemicals present. In addition, distributors of hazardous chemicals arerequired to ensure that containers they distribute are properly labeled,and that material safety data sheets are provided to their customers inthe manufacturing sector. An effort has been made to make provisions ofthe employee exposure and medical records access rule as nearly identicalas possible to those found in the hazard communication standard in orderto provide uniformity and policy consistency. B. Litigation The May 1980 regulation has been the subject of litigation in several courts.On May 21, 1980, the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO, petitioned theUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit toreview the rule pursuant to section 6(f) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 655(f).<T3>Industrial Union Dept. AFL-CIO </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>No. 80-1550. The Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Chamber of Commerce of theUnited States later intervened in that lawsuit. In July 1980, a numberof individuals and two trade associations, the Association of Diving Contractorsand the Louisiana Chemical Association, subsequently petitioned the FifthCircuit Court of Appeals under the same section 6(f) review provision.These cases were transferred to the D.C. Circuit under 28 U.S.C. 2112(a)and consolidated with the pending IUD case. These cases are currently inabeyance to permit this reconsideration of the regulation to be completed.Also in abeyance in the D.C. Circuit is <T3>National Constructions Association </T3>v. <T3>OSHA, </T3>No. 80-1820, a challenge to the regulation's applicationto the construction industry. A separate challenge to the rule was filed in January 1981 by the tradeassociations representing the flavor and fragrance industries in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Maryland (Civ. Action Nos. Y-81-66,Y-81-67). This case was withdrawn and ultimately dismissed when a partialadministrative stay was issued covering these industries. In addition, the Louisiana Chemical Association and several individualschallenged the rule in July 1980 in the United States District Court forthe Western District of Louisiana, claiming the Court had jurisdictionby reason of, <T3>inter alia; </T3>28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1337. The District Court originallydismissed the case on the basis that review of OSHA regulations was vestedin the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case was appealed to the Fifth CircuitCourt of Appeals. The Fifth Circuit ultimately held that the rule was asection 8 regulation and therefore the District Court had jurisdictionto consider the case. <T3>Louisiana Chemical Association </T3>v. <T3>Bingham, </T3>657 F.2d 777 (5th Cir. 1981). It therefore returned thecase to the District Court to consider it on the merits. On November 5, 1982, the United States District Court for the Western Districtof Louisiana upheld the validity of OSHA's records access regulation. <T3>Louisiana Chemical Association </T3>v. <T3>Bingham, </T3>550 F. Supp. 1136 (W.D. La. 1982). This decision wasaffirmed by the Fifth Circuit in <T3>Louisiana Chemical Association </T3>v. <T3>Bingham, </T3>731 F.2d 280 (5th Cir. 1984). C. Administrative Stay for Construction On April 28, 1981, OSHA administratively stayed the records access rulewith respect to the construction industry (46 FR 23740). The stay was grantedto allow a review of the regulation by the Advisory Committee on ConstructionSafety and Health (the ``Construction Advisory Committee''), which hadnot been consulted during the original development of the rule. The termsof the stay required that employers in the industry: (1) Continue to preserveexposure and medical records and made them available to OSHA, and (2) makeemployee medical records available to employees. The April 28 notice alsorequested other interested parties to submit written comments concerningthe impact of the records access standard on the construction industry.Docket H-112C was established to receive these comments. The Construction Advisory Committee met on June 10-12, 1981, and, afterconsidering the impact of the records access rule on the construction industry,voted that the stay should be lifted, and further offered 13 suggestionsand recommendations concerning the standard (Exs. 3-62, 3-63). OSHA alsoreceived 45 written comments concerning the issues raised by the stay.After a review of the comments submitted into Docket H-112C and of therecommendations made by the Construction Advisory Committee, OSHA liftedthe administrative stay on September 15, 1981 (46 FR 45758). In this noticeOSHA dealt specifically with the 13 recommendations submitted by the ConstructionAdvisory Committee and stated further that the issue of the appropriatenessof the records access rule for construction would be considered as partof its review of the entire records access regulation in general. D. Proposed Interim Modification On August 7, 1981 (46 FR 40490), OSHA published interpretations of therecords access regulation concerning: (1) The 15-day limit for providingrecords (andSection; 1910.20(e)(1)(i)), (2) the coverage of exposure recordsof ``similarly exposed employees'' (andSection;1910.20(e)(2)(i)(B), (3) thecoverage of records privileged from discovery, and (4) the sanctions permittedfor employee breaches of confidentiality agreements (andSection;1910.20(f)(3)).In this notice OSHA also announced a partial stay of the records accessrule for the flavor and fragrance industry.OSHA also published on August 7 a proposed interim modification of theregulation to permit employers to include liquidated damages clauses orthe like in confidentiality agreements while they may require of employeedesignated representatives prior to disclosing toxic substance informationwhich is a trade secret (46 FR 40492). This notice requested interestedparties to submit written comments concerning this issue. Docket H-112Dwas established to receive these comments. 46 written comments were subsequentlysubmitted. This proposed interim modification was later merged into OSHA'soverall reconsideration of the records access rule (47 FR 20429). E. The ProposalBecause the record access regulation raised complex policy and legal questionswith respect to several of its provisions, the Secretary determined thatit was an appropriate subject for reconsideration in light of current policiesand experience. Accordingly, on July 13, 1982, OSHA published its proposalto modify the Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records rule (47FR 30420). The proposal was based on all comments and information submittedto OSHA since the regulation was originally promulgated in May 1980 (45FR 35212 <T3>et seq.), </T3>including the comments contained in Dockets H-112C andH-112D. The proposal gave interested parties until September 14, 1982 tosubmit comments, views, and arguments on any issues raised by the proposal.Comments were specifically invited on: (1) The definition of ``employee'';(2) the definition of ``exposure''; (3) the definition of ``toxic substance'';(4) the preservation requirements for employee exposure and medical records;(5) the prohibition on the microfilm storage of X-rays; (6) union accessto exposure records; (7) trade secret protection provisions; and (8) theprovision of regulatory relief for small businesses. Docket H-112E wasestablished to receive all evidence concerning the proposed modifications,and a total of 116 comments were received. F. The HearingsThe July 13 proposal also announced a schedule of informal public hearings.These hearings were held from October 5, 1982 through October 13, 1982in Washington, DC, and were presided over by Administrative Law Judge FrankJ. Marcellino. All hearing participants were afforded the opportunity topresent oral testimony and to question other witnesses. A total of 20 interestedindividuals and organizations testified at these hearings, and five additionalparticipants submitted written testimony. Hearing participants were givenuntil November 12, 1982, to submit additional evidence and factual material,and until December 13, 1982, to submit post-hearing comments or arguments.G. The RecordThe public record on the proposed regulation was certified by Judge Marcellinoon January 10, 1983. The record consists of all material submitted to theOSHA Docket Office, Docket No. H-112E, by either OSHA or the public, including:(1) Comments on the July 13 proposal; (2) background materials collectedby OSHA; (3) notices of intent to appear at the public hearings; (4) verbatimtranscripts of the public hearings; (5) hearing exhibits; and (6) post-hearingcomments. Dockets No. H-112C and H-112D have also been incorporated byreference into the H-112E record. OSHA also relies on the original H-112Docket, which was compiled at the time of the rulemaking for the May 1980regulation, in issuing this modified rule. Copies of the official list of items in the total record, as well as theitems themselves, are available from the OSHA Docket Office, Docket No.H-112E, Room S-6212, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution AvenueNW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone 202-523-7894. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Legal Authority </ITAG>This modification of OSHA's Access to Employee Exposure and Medical RecordsRegulation, 29 CFR 1910.20, is being issued under the authority grantedto the Secretary in section 8 of the Occupational Safety and Health Actof 1970, 29 U.S.C. 657. Authority for the standard may be found in sections8(g)(2) and 8(c)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 657(g)(2), 657(c)(1). Section8(g)(2) reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary * * * shall * * * prescribe such rules and regulationsas he may deem necessary to carry out (his) responsibilities under thischapter, including rules and regulations dealing with the inspection ofan employer's establishment.</ITAG>Section 8(c)(1) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Each employer shall make, keep and preserve, and make available tothe Secretary * * * such records regarding his activities relating to thischapter as the Secretary * * * may prescribe by regulations as necessaryor appropriate for the enforcement of this chapter or for developing informationregarding the causes and prevention of occupational accidents and illnesses.</ITAG>The May 1980 standard was issued under both section 6 and section 8 authority.The issue of whether 29 CFR 1910.20 could legitimately be characterizedas an occupational safety and health standard under section 6, which woulddetermine whether it was properly challengeable in a district court orthe courts of appeals, was the subject of litigation in the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit decided thatas a jurisdictional matter it could not be considered a section 6 standardbut could be considered a section 8 regulation. Its reasoning was thatCongress apparently intended standards to aim toward correction of specificand already identified hazards, and that the records access standard doesnot do so. Rather, its function, as the Court stated it, is possible detection,over a long period, of significant risks not yet covered by standards.In addition, it fits neatly within the language and history of section8, which authorizes issuance of enforcement and detection regulations.<T3>Louisiana Chemical Association, et al. </T3>v. <T3>Bingham, et al., </T3>657 F.2d 777 (1981). On remand, the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana heldon the merits that the promulgation of 29 CFR 1910.20 was in fact a validexercise of the Secretary's section 8 general rulemaking authority. <T3>Louisiana Chemical Association, et al. </T3>v. <T3>Bingham, et al., </T3>550 F. Supp. 1136 (1982). The Court held:<ITAG tagnum="21">Even a cursory examination of the Act's overarching policy and themeans by which it may be achieved make plain the fact that the recordsaccess rule bears at least a reasonable relation to that propose. The rulewill serve to establish a primary data base regarding long-term exposureto toxic substances and harmful physical agents. Such a pool of informationwill obviously be of great utility to medical/industrial research in theisolation and identification of latent occupational diseases and healthhazards yet unknown. Therefore, the records access rule aids in the researcheffort noted in 29 U.S.C andSection; 651(b)(5); provides an additional meansof discovering latent diseases and establishing causal connections betweendiseases and work in environmental conditions within the meaning of (b)(6);establishes an additional reporting procedure as outlined in (b)(12); andserves to encourage labor-management efforts to reduce disease arisingout of employment in accordance with (b)(13). Given the insidious natureand long-term effects of many latent occupational diseases, a rule whichestablishes a data base for medical research, as does the record accessrule bears more than a mere reasonable relation to the major policy goalof the Act. The records access rule is quite directly related to the goalsof assuring ``safe and healthful working conditions'' and ``preservingour human resources.'' (Ex. 49, pp. 5-6)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It also held that while section 8(g)(2) would by itself provide sufficientauthority for the records access rule and more specific support for theregulations with respect to OSHA access to the records covered by it, isfound in section 8(c)(1), 29 U.S.C. 657(c)(1).Based on these foregoing court decisions, it is the law of the case thatthe Record Access rule is issued pursuant to section 8 of the Act. ThereforeOSHA is promulgating these amendments to the Records Access rule pursuantto section 8. OSHA continues to conclude that the Record Access rule isimportant to carry out the purposes of the Act. These amendments modify29 CFR 1910.20 in several respects, but its essential character and purposehave not changed. As before, the records access rule is designed to yieldboth direct and indirect improvements in the detection, treatment, andprevention of occupational disease. To this end, employee access to exposureand medical data will enable workers and their representatives to playan important role in their own health management. The data obtained willenable an employee's personal physician to diagnose, treat and possiblyprevent permanent disease. It will also serve to decrease the incidenceof occupational health problems, for once an employee is informed of theidentity of hazardous substances he or she faces on the job and the potentialhealth consequences or exposure to them, the individual can minimize futureexposure through prudent work practices. Second, access to exposure and medical records by employees, their designatedrepresentatives, health professionals acting on behalf of employees, andOSHA will facilitate research to uncover patterns of health impairmentand disease, and to establish causal connections between disease and exposureto particular hazards. In turn, this will enable the Secretary to effectuatethe purposes of the Act, including the establishment of uniform nationalhealth and safety standards. Third, employees can use this information to obtain implementation of newprotective control measures. The use of the data may take any of severalforms. Most importantly, informed employees will be in a better positionto exercise their statutory rights (e.g., complaints to OSHA, participationin OSHA inspections). Employees may also marshall this information to discussimproving conditions in the workplace directly with their employers, throughwhatever means are available to them.A fuller discussion of the basis for these findings may be found in thepreamble to the May 1980 regulation (45 FR 35212 <T3>et seq.</T3>).Because the Records Access regulation, as modified herein, is related tothose statutorily sanctioned purposes, the Secretary finds that it is necessaryto carry out his responsibilities under the Act. It remains therefore avalid exercise of his section 8 general rulemaking authority. Cf., <T3>Mourning</T3> v. <T3>Family Publications Service, Inc., </T3>411 U.S. 356 (1973); <T3>Whirlpool Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Marshall,</T3> 445 U.S. 1 (1980).OSHA has made a conscious effort to make the provisions of the RecordsAccess rule, as far as possible, parallel to those found in the HazardCommunication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). The Records Access rule andthe Hazard Communication standard will work together to form a comprehensiveregulatory structure for informing employees of the hazardous substancesfound in their workplace and the steps to be taken to control such exposures.The Hazard Communication standard requires the development of MSDS's andtheir communication to workers in the manufacturing sector of industry.The Records Access rule supplements the Hazard Communication standard byextending access to current MSDS's which have been retained to employeesin general industry, construction and maritime.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Discussion of Significant Issues and Summary of the Final Regulation</ITAG>This rulemaking, initiated in 1982, has addressed several important issuesconcerning the 1980 regulation. The decisions reflected in this revisedstandard reflect the evidence currently in the record. The Office of Managementand Budget, in its review of the paperwork requirements of this rule, hasrecommended that OSHA consider whether additional rulemaking would be appropriatein order to further evaluate the effectiveness of record retention provisionsof the current rule and the appropriateness of the definition of ``employee''as defined by this final rule. At issue is whether OSHA's experience underthe current rule points to possible improvements which could be made. Morespecifically, are changes necessary and appropriate to reduce the recordkeepingburdens while retaining the effectiveness of the standard?In order to examine these issues more closely, and in the context of otherFederal programs and activities, OSHA will participate in an interagencyworking group to examine this regulation and make recommendations, as appropriate,for revisions that may be needed to assure that the records most usefulto employee health and health research purposes are retained. The recommendationsof this working group will be evaluated by OSHA to determine the need forfurther rulemaking. In order to give OSHA sufficient flexibility to respondto the recommendations of the working group, OSHA is continuing to considerthe definitions of ``employee'', ``employee exposure records'' and ``toxicsubstance'' pending receipt of the working group recommendations. Basedon the working group recommendations, OSHA will either publish its finaldetermination to retain the definitions in the existing standard or reproposenew definitions as the basis for further rulemaking. In the interim, ofcourse, pending final resolution of these definitions, the existing definitionswill continue to apply.A. Scope and Application<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General</ITAG>The 1980 regulation applied ``to each general industry, maritime, and constructionemployer who makes, maintains, contracts for, or has access to employeeexposure or medical records, or analyses thereof, pertaining to employeesexposed to toxic substances or harmful physical agents'' (paragraph (b)(1)).The regulation applied to records whether or not they were related to specificoccupational safety and health standards, and also applied to records createdprior to the effective date of the standard, August 21, 1980. The broadscope of the 1980 regulation was a major issue in the proposal.The issue of scope is best considered through evaluation of its three majorcomponents: (1) The number of employees covered, (2) the industries covered,and (3) the types of records covered. The latter component, the types ofrecords covered, is directly dependent upon the definitions of ``employeeexposure record'' and ``employee medical record,'' and is therefore discussedin the ``definitions'' section below.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Employees Covered</ITAG>The 1980 rule applies to the exposure and medical records of all employeesexposed to toxic substances and harmful physical agents. Following issuanceof the 1980 regulation, several commenters argued that the rule's scopewas too broad. They noted that literal construction of the 1980 regulationindicated that records of employees only marginally exposed to toxic substancesand arguably not at health risk from such exposures were evidently coveredby the rule as long as the nature of their exposure was different fromtypical non-occupational exposure. For example, the concern was expressedthat records of office workers who make only infrequent or sporadic visitsto production areas where toxic substances or harmful physical agents arepresent would be subject to the retention and access provisions of theregulation (SOCMA, Ex. 3-58; Prudential, Ex. 3-31).Responding to these concerns, OSHA proposed to limit the rule's coverageto only those employees ``whose work directly involve(s) the manufacturing,processing, installation, handling, packaging, transport, disposal, oruse of toxic substances, or who (are) subject to harmful physical agents(e.g., noise, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, hypo- or hyperbaricpressure) in any manner different from non-occupational situations; including,but not limited to, coverage of production, maintenance, transport andconstruction workers'' (paragraph (b)(1); 47 FR 30434). This modificationwould have targeted the regulation at those groups of employees whose jobduties typically involve substantial exposure to toxic substances or harmfulphysical agents. Production, maintenance, construction, and transport workerswould have been covered if toxic substances or harmful physical agentswere present in their workplaces, with no further inquiry necessary onwhether each individual is working directly with a toxic substance or harmfulphysical agent. For instance, an electrician working near a welding operationon a construction site would have been covered. At the suggestion of theAdvisory Committee for Construction Safety and Health, ``installation''was added to paragraph (b)(1) to clarify the broad coverage of constructionworkers (Exs. 3-62, 3-63).In addition, those workers whose job duties do not usually involve substantialexposures (e.g., most office workers) would not ordinarily have been covered.However, the proposed revision would have continued to provide for accessto exposure and medical records of any general industry, construction ormaritime employee not otherwise covered by the standard who was accidentallyexposed to a toxic substance or harmful physical agent to a degree sufficientto require medical treatment.Many employers supported the proposed changes in their written and oralsubmissions (Exs. 4-1, 4-7, 4-17, 4-27, 4-28, 4-30, 4-41, 4-62, 4-66, 4-68,4-69, 4-76, 4-80, 4-92, 4-109, 4-113; Tr. 828, 1047). In general, theymaintained that ``the new definition of `employee' reasonably limits theapplication of this regulation to those workers who are more than casuallyexposed to toxic substances'' (AFMA, Tr. 828).Although no estimates were submitted from industry concerning the possiblecost savings of the proposed provision, testimony was submitted that ``asinitially promulgated, the records access rule covered too many employeesto be a truly useful means of additional protection, and imposed a considerableburden on employers to maintain accurate and comprehensive records whichprovided reasonably rapid access'' (Pennzoil, Ex. 4-30).Employee groups and other participants responded that the proposed provisionexcluded many groups of employees clearly at risk from exposure to toxicsubstances and harmful physical agents, and who are therefore likely tobenefit from access to exposure and medical records (Exs. 4-77, 4-98; Tr.100, 123, 144, 187, 347, 415, 471, 503, 527, 919, 1020, 1079).To illustrate that workers not directly involved with the handling of toxicsubstances are potentially at risk from exposure, the ICWU gave as an example``a situation where asbestos dust due to the poor ventilation in the plantwas mixed with other dust and spread throughout the plant. So there wasno worker in the plant itself that was not at risk to asbestos'' (ICWU,Tr. 347).Cal/OSHA also noted that ``office workers connected with manufacturingareas may become exposed to high levels of manufacturing contaminants ifthere are sloppy work practices'' (Ex. 17, p. 10). Specifically, Cal/OSHAcited an investigation of a battery plant which found dangerous levelsof lead in the front office, and a study of the Virginia kepone incidentwhich stated that ``employees had been exposed to kepone wherever theyworked, rested, ate or drank within the confines of the plant.'' Cal/OSHAalso cited a case where workers in an office building were made ill byworkplace exposures:<ITAG tagnum="21">In March of 1982, 250 state employees who work in the Bateson Buildingin Sacramento complained of recurring health problems involving headaches,burning eyes, and general poor health. These health complaints have beenassociated with noxious fumes and poor air circulation in the building.(Ex. 17, p. 10)</ITAG>After considering the rulemaking record, OSHA has determined that it isappropriate to retain coverage of employees as stated in the 1980 regulation.OSHA finds insufficient evidence for categorically excluding ``casuallyexposed'' workers from the scope of the rule for purposes of providingaccess to the records of such workers. Because the rulemaking record isless clear with respect to the practical utility of retaining the recordsof ``casually exposed'' workers, OSHA will continue to consider this issuethrough participation in the working group described earlier. In the interim,the existing definition of ``employee'' will continue to apply. The recordshows that both production line workers and executives have become illfrom brief exposures to toxic substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Records Created Under Contract</ITAG>The status under the 1980 regulation of records created under contractwas a source of confusion to several affected parties who were concernedthat employers would be held strictly liable in collateral litigation foractions by physicians not fully under their control (Ex. 62, pp. 37-46;Ex. 60, p. 3). The proposal would have modified paragraph (b)(3) to clarifythe obligations of employers who contract for exposure measurement or medicalservices. The proposed modification required that ``each employer shallensure that the requirements of this section are made known to physiciansand others providing medical or industrial hygiene services under contractto the employer and shall make a good faith effort to ensure, by modificationof the contract if necessary, that such persons comply with the preservationand access requirements of the section'' (47 FR 30434).The proposed provision was challenged by some participants. Mr. Peter Weiner(Cal/OSHA) noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">If an employer does not create the violation and does everything reasonablypossible to modify the contract in an attempt to comply, existing caselaw which we have cited clearly states that the employer will not be subjectto citation. (Tr. 420)</ITAG>Therefore it would not be necessary to modify the regulation in responseto these concerns. Mr. Robert Frase (UPIU) also testified:<ITAG tagnum="21">We have no objection to contracting medical services out to qualifiedoccupational health providers_in fact, care is often more objective andcomprehensive when provided by independent occupational health specialists.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These specialists certainly recognize the value of maintaining recordsfor epidemiological research. But we strongly oppose creating the optionfor employers to abrogate their legal and ethical responsibility to makerecords compiled on their employees available to these individuals andto retain those records for a period of time that makes health researchfeasible. (Tr. 763-764)</ITAG>OSHA has determined that, under the language of the 1980 rule, employerscan not be penalized if they make reasonable efforts to comply with theaccess rule when using contract services if such efforts fail for reasonsbeyond their control. This is not only a matter of OSHA interpretationbut of applicable legal principles. Altering the language of the regulation,however, to conform to the proposal could result in reduced efforts toassure compliance when contract services are being used. OSHA, therefore,will retain the 1980 provision for the final rule, and to provide thisclarification of its intent with respect to enforcement.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Industries Covered</ITAG>Several trade groups have argued that certain industries ought to be exemptedfrom coverage. In particular, employer groups in the flavor and fragranceindustries (Exs. 3-44, 3-45, 3-47, 3-48, 3-50, 3-52), the constructionindustry (Exs. 3-40, 3-43), and the commercial diving industry (Ex. 3-86),have argued for limited or full exemption from the provisions of the regulation.The flavor and fragrance industries were the subject of a partial administrativestay designed to protect their trade secrets (46 FR 40490-91). This staywas extended to August 15, 1983 (48 FR 6332), and was later extended toFebruary 1, 1984 (48 FR 36576). The stay was further extended to February1986 pending final revisions to the Access Rule (49 FR 5112, 50 FR 5752).a. <T3>Flavor and fragrance industries.</T3> The flavor and fragrance industriesbased their justifications for exemption primarily on the following assertions:(1) The broad definition of ``toxic substance'' includes many food andfragrance substances which, on the basis of objective data, are demonstratedto be safe; (2) the possibility under the regulation for disclosure ofvaluable trade secret formulas greatly outweighs the benefits of disclosure;and (3) the Records Access rule overlaps regulation of these industriesby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Agriculture(USDA).For example, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) statedthat ``(T)he standard's definition of toxic substances is so broad thatmany traditional innocuous food ingredients (i.e., sugar, vanilla, andlemon oil) would be considered `toxic' within the meaning of the standard.The sheer number of substances considered `toxic' under the standard willmake compliance with requests for disclosure both extremely costly andvery difficult'' (Ex. 3-44, p. 1). FEMA also notes that ``(T)rade secretsare the lifeblood of the flavor industry and are most carefully guardedby flavor manufacturers * * *. The disclosure required by the standardwould threaten the very existence of the flavor industry without any showingthat flavors and flavor materials present significant risks to any workeror that those risks would be lessened or eliminated because of the standard''(Ex. 3-44, p. 2).In the proposal, OSHA decided that rather than exempt these industriesentirely, their legitimate concerns would be addressed through modificationof specific provisions of the regulation. In particular, OSHA proposedboth narrowing the definition of ``toxic substance'' and modifying thetrade secret provisions to substantially reduce the likelihood that therelease of trade secrets would be required. The proposed trade secret modificationsparalleled in significant respects the current stay for the flavor andfragrance industries, which had evidently satisfied those industries' concernsin this interim period (Tr. 214). OSHA permitted the stay to remain ineffect while considering comments in response to this issue as raised inthe proposal. No convincing arguments were found in the record refute theAgency's discussion that the proposed modifications would alleviate theconcerns expressed over trade secret access.Therefore, this final regulation adopts the more specific provisions describedabove and which are discussed in detail later in this preamble. OSHA believesthat the new definition of ``toxic substance'' and more protective requirementswith respect to trade secret access will provide the necessary protectionfor employers in the flavor and fragrance industries, as well as otherconcerned employers.Finally, the fact that these industries are subject to extensive Food andDrug Administration regulation does not detract from the need for thisstandard because the FDA has no comparable records access regulation.b. <T3>Commercial diving industry.</T3> The Association of Diving Contractors(ADC), representing the commercial diving industry, sought a stay of theRecords Access rule it applied to employees engaged in commercial divingon the grounds that: (1) The rule was improperly promulgated as it appliedto them; (2) divers are not exposed to ``toxic substances or harmful physicalagents''; and (3) the regulation jeopardized valuable trade secrets suchas proprietary decompression tables (Ex. 3-86). The Agency, while denyingthis stay request as lacking merit, issued an official interpretation ofrecordkeeping obligations in the diving industry which explained the interactionbetween the records access regulation, 29 CFR 1910.20, and the commercialdiving standard, 29 CFR 1910.401-441, and clarified how these obligationscould be met without jeopardizing the trade secrecy of the tables (Ex.3-87). Since employees in the commercial diving industry are subject tooccupational illness associated with their workplace exposure (e.g., mixedgases, hyperbaric pressure), OSHA saw no basis for excluding the industryfrom the records access regulation.At the hearings, the ADC argued that OSHA has no jurisdiction over offshorediving because it has been totally preempted by the Coast Guard. It furtherargued that even with respect to inshore diving, the records access rulecould not apply to them because: (1) Diving employees are not subject to``toxic substances or harmful physical agents'' other than ``latent butbasically uncontrollable safety hazards,'' and (2) the decision in ADC'schallenge to the commercial diving standard, <T3>Taylor Diving</T3> and <T3>Salvage Co., Inc.</T3> v. <T3>U.S. Department of Labor, </T3>599 F. 2d 622 (5th Cir. 1979), barsapplication of records access regulation to the diving industry (Tr. 628-34).The ADC subsequently sued OSHA in another case with the same name, <T3>Taylor Diving </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Dept. of Labor </T3>(No. 68-3400, District Ct. for the Dist. ofCol.), to move that the records access regulation be held invalid for offshorediving. The Court rejected the challenge and upheld the standard for diving.It held that the Coast Guard's regulation of offshore diving did not preemptthe OSHA regulation because of the legislative history, Supreme Court,and other court interpretations of the relevant language and because theOSHA regulation served a different purpose. It also upheld the purposeof the OSHA regulation as necessary for research into diver's diseases.An appeal was filed but a motion to withdraw the appeal was filed September28, 1987.Consequently, the legal contentions of the ADC have been rejected by theCourt. OSHA policy of the need for this regulation for research into diver'sdiseases has been upheld. In addition, as discussed below, offshore diversneed information about their medical conditions and exposure to protecttheir health.Therefore, OSHA concludes that it is appropriate to continue to have theRecords Access regulation apply to offshore diving operations.With respect to OSHA's coverage of inshore diving, the following pointsapply. First, the Coast Guard does not regulate inshore diving so section4(b)(1) does not generally apply. Second, the existence of hazards in thediving industry is well-documented (see 42 FR 37651-52). The fact thatsome of these hazards are in a sense ``naturally occurring'' due to thenature of diving and the environment in which it takes place is irrelevantto OSHA's authority to require the maintenance and availability of recordsdocumenting their effects. To the extent that divers are subject to substancesthat may be toxic under their conditions of use (e.g., breathing gasesunder pressure, carbon monoxide) or harmful physical agents (e.g., hyperbaricpressure, noise), their need for the regulation is no less than other employeeswho are covered by it. The commercial diving standard, 29 CFR 1910.401<T3>et seq., </T3>whose purpose is to control the hazards inherent in commercialdiving practices, itself requires the keeping of certain exposure records,and the keeping of medical records, while no longer required by the standard,is common to the industry. While there is much that is already known aboutthe adverse physiological effects that can be caused by diving, there isalso much that remains to be known, especially concerning its long-termeffects. By requiring the keeping and availability of these records, theRecords Access rule, as elsewhere, promotes occupational safety and healthin this industry by ensuring the preservation of this invaluable data base.c. <T3>Construction Industry. </T3>The 1980 Access rule did not provide exemptionor special treatment to any industry segment, including construction. TheAgency determined at that time that there was no rational basis for categoricallyexcluding any broad class of employers from coverage. OSHA argued thatthe rule did not impose burdensome or unreasonable administrative on economiccosts on any class of employers. In addition, OSHA pointed out that theNIOSH National Occupational Hazards Survey documented the fact that exposuresto toxic substances occur throughout industry among all types and sizesof employers. Finally, the Agency argued that there was no justificationfor excluding employees exposed to toxic substances for a matter of weeksor months as opposed to years since even short-term exposures to toxicsubstances have been associated with the occurrence of chronic and acutedisease.After issuance of the 1980 rule, however, the construction industry objectedto having it cover that segment due primarily to the transient nature ofconstruction workers. They argued that long-term retention of numerousrecords of short-term employees would be of little use. In addition, itwas pointed out that the Construction Advisory Committee had not been solicitedby OSHA to review and comment on the 1980 rule prior to its promulgation.In response to these concerns OSHA partially stayed the Records Accessregulation with respect to the construction industry (46 FR 23740; April28, 1981). In that notice, OSHA solicited comments from interested partiesconcerning the experience of the construction industry under the rule,and specifically what aspects of the construction industry render the standardinappropriate. A total of 47 comments were received. Also, the AdvisoryCommittee for Construction Safety and Health (CAC) met June 10-12, 1981,in Washington, DC and considered the issue of records access (Exs. 3-62,3-63). OSHA published a summary and analysis of the comments and the AdvisoryCommittee recommendations in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 15, 1981 (46 FR 45758).Employers in the construction industry argued during the rulemaking thatthe Records Access regulation posed certain practical compliance difficulties.The industry maintained that: (1) Construction employees are exposed totoxic substances, if at all, for only brief periods of time since theirwork requires movement from place to place on the construction site; (2)due to the large number of temporary employees (the typical constructionemployee annual turnover rate is between 300 and 600 percent), the regulationrequires long-term retention of huge numbers of individual records havinga negligible degree of occupational health significance; (3) the principaltypes of employee records generated on a construction site are much differentfrom those generated in general industry_most monitoring is done on anarea basis, and records do not reveal the identities of employees who mayhave been working in those areas; and (4) medical records generated areprimarily those concerned with first aid and emergency treatment (DocketH-112C; Ex. 2-42A, pp. 4-6).On the other hand, worker organizations (Ex. 2-31) maintained that thetranscience and mobility of construction workers make the access standardparticularly appropriate for the construction industry. since constructionworkers do not have the benefit of many of the industrial hygiene controlsfound at permanent fixed work site and there is currently no other mechanismfor providing a continuous medical history for construction workers. Thosesupporting construction coverage also argued that modern computerized recordkeepingmethods make the storage and access of medical and exposure records feasibleand inexpensive.Finally, the CAC recommended, among other things, that OSHA lift the stayin recognition of the fact that construction employees are exposed to awide variety of toxic substances and that access to and retention of recordsis necessary due to latency periods of many occupational diseases.Based on its analysis of the comments and CAC recommendations, OSHA liftedthe stay for the construction industry. At the same time, the agency issuedinterpretations which incorporated most of the CAC recommendations thatalleviated many of construction's concerns and stated that the constructionrecords access issues would continue to be reviewed as part of the generalmodification process.In developing the proposed revisions, OSHA determined that the needs ofconstruction workers for access to records that are kept on toxic exposuresor health status are at least as great as the needs of industrial workers(Docket H-112C; Exs. 3-24, 3-31, 3-33, 3-41, and 3-45). Most complaintsfrom affected employers did not challenge, and in fact largely supported,the basic premises of the regulation, but instead targeted certain specificprovisions, such as the broad scope of the rule, as being too burdensome.To tailor the regulation to the needs of the construction industry, OSHAproposed: (1) Incorporation of various interpretations which were madein response to the June 11, 1981, CAC recommendations; (2) exemption ofconstruction industry from medical records retention requirements beyondthe duration of employment; (3) modification of the definition of ``toxicsubstance;'' (4) removal of records of most first aid and emergency treatmentfrom the definition of ``employee medical record;'' and (5) eliminationof purchase order type records of chemical identity from the definitionof ``exposure record.'' The latter three proposed changes were not specificto the construction industry, but were expected to be of particular relevanceto it. A draft of the proposal was submitted to the Advisory Committee which meton March 3-5, 1982, for its further consideration. The CAC submitted sevenadditional recommendations, which were considered and, for the most part,accepted in developing the proposal (Exs. 3-77, 3-78, 3-82). It is importantto note that none of the CAC recommendations goes to the basic issue ofconstruction industry coverage. On that question, the CAC position hasbeen that the regulation is necessary and appropriate for the constructionindustry. Several commenters, however, disagreed with the CAC positionand asserted that construction employment should not be covered by theregulation. In general, however, these commenters did not provide evidencethat access to exposure and medical records was not of occupational healthimportance to construction workers, nor did they present evidence indicatingthat the current rule has placed an intolerable burden on employers. Forexample, several commentors submitted the identical following statement,but did not demonstrate the ``practical'' difficulties attributed to therule with respect to construction or their company: ``It is our view thatthe proposed Medical Records Access Standards is not practical for usein the construction industry, and especially for our company'' (Exs. 4-32,4-32, 4-34, 4-114, 4-115). Another commentor's submission consisted ofthe following: ``The proposed Medical Records Access Standards 1910.20is not practical for the construction industry. It is definitely not practicalfor our company and WE DO STRONGLY OPPOSE IT''. (Ex. 4-25) While expressing a strong preference, the foregoing comments do not containany substantive information that demonstrates the validity of that preference.Therefore, OSHA finds that the record supports the determination to acceptthe CAC position and continue to include construction employment withinthe scope of the regulation. The changes in this rule to exclude retentionof first aid records and records of short term employees for 30 years eliminatesany possible practical difficulties. Several of the proposed changes were opposed by labor representatives inthe construction industry (Exs. 4-22, 4-43; Tr. 1076-1109). With regardto the proposed changes to the records retention requirements, the Buildingand Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">The BCTD does not agree that the record retention requirement in theconstruction industry should be different from that in other industries.While we recognize that there exists in the construction industry a greaterturnover of employees, the need for long-term medical recordkeeping asa tool for epidemiological studies is just as important in the constructionindustry as in other industries. (Ex. 4-43, p. 4)</ITAG>Mr. Ronald Wollford (IBPAT) added:<ITAG tagnum="21">Excluding construction employers from the data storage requirementsof this standard is, therefore, one of the worst things that could be donefor the future of the construction industry. These records could be providedand stored through services that already exist at very low costs * * *(Tr. 1082)</ITAG>Based on this evidence that retention of personal medical records in theconstruction industry is of occupational health importance, OSHA has determinedthat it is appropriate to accept the CAC position and not promulgate separatemedical records retention periods for the construction industry. However, in response to concerns from both general industry and constructionemployers, OSHA has incorporated the final rule an exemption for medicalrecords of short-term (less than one year) employees and most first aidrecords from the records retention requirements of the regulation. Employeeaccess to these records would continue to be required to the extent available,but employers would be relieved of the burden of having to retain theserecords for extended periods of time. Since in the construction industryemployee turnover is high (Ex. 4-57, Att. I, p. 5) and most records ofa medical nature are first aid records (Ex. 4-57, Att. J, p. 6), theseexemptions should provide construction employers considerable relief fromthe burdens of the regulation. Yet, at the same time, the exposure recordsfor all employees and the medical records of long-term employees will remainavailable for epidemiologic evaluation concerning occupational diseasesassociated with the construction industry. Full discussions of the regulation's retention requirements and the specifictreatment of first aid records and medical records of short-term employeesare discussed elsewhere in this preamble. After reviewing all the evidence and comments in the record of this proceeding,OSHA has concluded that construction should be covered by the Access rule.OSHA finds that the health needs of construction workers are similar toemployees in other sectors and that various changes that have been madein the rule overcome specific problems which might exist in construction.B. <T3>Definitions </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Analysis Using Exposure or Medical Records. </ITAG>Among the records covered by this rule are ``analyses using exposure ormedical records.'' The definition of this phrase was modified in the proposalto exclude ``research'' and ``other'' studies, thereby including only datacompilations or statistical studies based on information contained at leastin part in employee exposure or medical records. This modification wasmeant to conform the language of the regulation closer to the originalintent, which was to cover such records as ``charts, graphs, tables, industrialhygiene surveys, evaluation of disease experience, and other summariesand evaluations'' of exposure and/or medical data, but not such recordsas engineering reports or the records of experimental toxicological research,which typically bear only a tenuous relationship to the actual workplaceexposures or health of employees. In making this distinction, OSHA wasparticularly concerned that the rule not act as a disincentive to employerswho are inclined to conduct research in the occupational health area beyondroutine measuring or monitoring of toxic exposures. Many commenters favoredthis modification (Exs. 4-11, 4-30, 4-60, 4-62, 4-68). Some parties, however, objected to this provision, maintaining that recordsof experimental toxicological research are important in diagnosing occupationalhealth problems (Exs. 4-9, 4-77; Tr. 481, 507, 528). Dr. Grace Ziem, M.D.(Johns Hopkins University) wrote that:<ITAG tagnum="21">I do feel, however, that in addition to trade secret information,physicians should also have access to experimental toxicological research.OSHA's proposal currently explicitly denies such access to workers andit is important for the medical consultant to have the most up-to-dateinformation on each chemcial. (Ex. 4-9, p. 1)</ITAG>Also, Mr. Barry Scott, C.T.II., stated that the proposed revisions ``apparently''ignores the fact that these engineering and toxicological research andreports have historically been the basis for setting and modifying guidelinesfor exposure to chemical substances and physical agents. In the absenceof more conventional occupational exposure information this informationcan be used by a competent health professional, in conjunction with theemployee to draw the appropriate conclusions'' (Ex. 4-98, p. 2).  While OSHA does not dispute that health professional access to engineeringstudies and experimental toxicological research can assist in the detectionand diagnosis of occupational health diseases, OSHA continues to maintainthat these records do not properly fall within the scope of this regulationin that they are not based on employee exposure or medical information.This conclusion is consistent with OSHA's original intent in promulgatingthe 1980 regulation. The preamble to that rule states that ``the phrase`any compilation of data, or any research, statistical or other study'more clearly expresses the intention to cover all situations where an employerevaluates or compiles exposure and/or medical data, charts, graphs, tables,industrial hygiene surveys, evaluations of disease experience, and othersummaries and evaulations are covered by the definition'' (45 FR 35260).Clearly, records or studies not based on employee exposure and/or medicalinformation, such an animal toxicological research or engineering studies,were not intended to be covered by this regulation.  Since the proposed provision better expresses OSHA's original intent, ithas been adopted for the final rule.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Employee  </ITAG>Modification of the definition of ``employee'' (paragraph (c)(4) was proposedto be consistent with the ``scope and application'' section. The proposaldefined ``employee'' as any employee ``whose work directly involves themanufacturing, processing, handling, installation, packaging, transport,disposal, or use of toxic substances, or who is subject to harmful physicalagents in any manner different from typical non-occupational situations,and includes, but is not limited to, coverage of production, maintenance,construction and transport workers'' (47 FR 30434). The need for ``directinvolvement'' was a limitation not found in the original rule.  As noted previously in the discussion of the scope of the regulation, OSHAhas decided not to alter the scope of the rule at this time. Therefore,``employee'' continues to be defined in the final rule as ``a current employee,a former employee, or an employee being assigned or transferred to workwhere there will be exposure to toxic substances or harmful physical agents.In the case of a deceased or legally incapacitated employee, the employee'slegal representative may directly exercise all the employee's rights underthis section.'' This is the same definition that appeared in the 1989 regulations. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Employee Exposure Record  </ITAG>OSHA proposed narrowing the definition of ``exposure record'' to conformmore closely to the common meaning of that term. The proposal requiredretention and access for only the following types of exposure records:(1) Environmental (workplace) monitoring results; (2) biological monitoringresults defined as exposure records by OSHA standards (other biologicalmonitoring would now be treated as medical records, which are entitledto greater confidentiality protection); and (3) material safety data sheets.Other records which reveal the identity of a toxic substance or harmfulphysical agent would no longer have to be treated as exposure records. In the absence of more formal exposure records (air contaminant measurements,biological monitoring data, material safety data sheets), paragraph (c)(5)of the 1980 rule also treated any other record which reveals the identityof a toxic substance (e.g., purchase records) as an ``exposure record.''The requirement to keep and make available this information, when coupledwith the broad definitions for ``toxic substance'' and ``exposure,'' wasthe source for much of the concern regarding trade secret disclosure andthe practical burdens of complying with the regulation. The proposal droppedthis aspect of the definition.  Mr. David Bossman (American Feed Manufacturers Association) commented withrespect to the 1980 regulation that ``(T)he rule, as adopted * * * requiresemployers to retain for at least 30 years massive quantities of routinedocuments, including production records, shipping records, invoices, etc.,which are not at all directly related to the purpose of the rule'' (Ex.3-26, p. 7).  Similarly, the feed manufacturing industry submitted a petition in September,1981, which sought a stay of the regulation as it applies to employee exposurerecords (Ex. 3-26). The industry maintained that `` `Exposure records'have been so broadly defined so as to include nearly every piece of papergenerated in many workplaces * * * (we) did not fully realize that theregulation likewise requires retention of literally thousands of routinedocuments.'' (Ex. 3-26, p. 2).  The proposed provision therefore responded favorably to the major concernsof many employers, including the construction, flavor and fragrance, foodprocessing and feed manufacturing industries, who maintained that accessto records such as purchase orders was burdensome and could have jeopardizedmany valuable trade secrets (Ex. 3-44).  Industry groups testified that the proposed provisions are justified dueto the compliance burden of maintaining large numbers of records, and thatonly records made for health, safety and environmental purposes shouldbe included under the ``exposure record'' definition (Exs. 4-11, 4-20,4-37, 4-60, 4-62, 4-66, 4-68, 4-78, 4-79, 4-109; Tr. 829). Dupont notedthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">Commonly, employees are required to perform tasks at various locationsthroughout the plant site. In the case of an employee required to travelthrough various areas, a site must conduct an extensive and burdensomesearch to locate all of the records which are covered by the access rule.When records are collected, they rarely, if ever, are correlated to particularemployees and do not quantify a particular employee's exposures. If itis possible to extrapolate employee exposures from these data, it is extremelytedious. The end result is that sites spend an extraordinary number ofman hours collecting data which really do not provide useful exposure informationfor employees. (Dupont, Ex. 4-68).</ITAG>By contrast, many interested parties commented that the proposed definitionwent too far in limiting the definition of ``exposure record,'' particularlyin eliminating qualitative records of chemical indentity from the definition(Ex. 4-98; Tr. 147, 165, 177, 760, 901, 1021). These parties maintain thatqualitative information can be extremely helpful in detecting the causesof occupational disease, since quantitative data often does not exist concerningtoxic workplace exposures. Mr. Wright (USW) noted in his testimony that``sometimes the worst problem in a workplace is the one for which the leastsampling exists'' (Tr. 901), indicating that at times companies may notbe aware that hazards exist in certain work areas, and therefore have notconducted exposure monitoring (Tr. 902).  Dr. Michael Silverstein of the United Auto Workers noted a specific casewhere qualitative information was used in detecting an occupational illness:<ITAG tagnum="21">In this regard, I'd like to draw attention to an outbreak of neurologicdamage to the bladders of workers exposed to a foam catalyst, trade nameNIAX ESN, in 1978 a plant manufacturing automobile seat cushions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this case, no traditional industrial hygiene exposure data wasavailable. However, the plant maintained production records indicatingthe amount of all the catalyst used on different assembly lines from weekto week and these records made it possible to reconstruct exposure historiesfor the sick workers and to identify NIAX ESN as the culprit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NIAX ESN was removed from the plant and the epidemic abruptly stopped.(Tr. 147)</ITAG>Moreover, employee groups make the argument that the current ``exposurerecord'' definition does not place an unrealistic compliance burden onemployers. They note that the current definition specifies coverage ofqualitative records of chemical identity only in the absence of other typesof exposure records. Therefore, if a chemical inventory, for instance,is available, there would be no requirement to retain records such as salesreceipts, purchase orders, batch cards, or other records which may containchemical identities. The regulation requires that some record of identityand exposure be kept, if available, not that all such records with duplicativeinformation be kept. Even though the regulation itself does not requirethe creation of records, these parties indicated that by voluntarily generatingan inventory list, as many do for their own purposes, an employer couldin fact reduce the total compliance burdens of the rule. The AFL-CIO statedin its post-hearing comments that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Industry has claimed that requirements covering ``other'' exposurerecords are burdensome and require the maintenance of voluminous unnecessaryrecords. We do not agree. First, ``other'' records of exposure must bemaintained only in the absence of quantitative measurements, or materialsafety data sheets for those toxic substances to which workers are exposed.The AFL-CIO believes the current standard is sufficiently flexible to allowthe preservation of lists of toxic substances, as opposed to copies ofall purchase orders, if all toxic chemicals and other identifying information(such as year of use, department location, etc.) are included (Ex. 16;Tr. 404). While the standard does not mandate the generation of such alist, it does in our view permit the development of a list on a voluntarybasis as an alternative means of compliance. (Ex. 59, p. 9)</ITAG>In assessing the burdens of the ``exposure record'' provision, the cost-savingfeatures of the current regulation should also be noted. Of primary importanceis the provision which allows employers to charge reasonable administrativecosts for repeat requests of records. This cost-saving provision will remainunchanged in the final rule. Thus, any broad request for historical recordsshould represent only a one-time employer expense, with the requestingparty bearing the expenses for any subsequent requests.In light of the evidence presented above, OSHA is modifying the ``employeeexposure record'' definition contained in the 1980 regulation. The firstmodification expressly indicates that a chemical inventory may be substitutedfor any other record which reveals the identity (e.g., chemical, common,or trade name) of a toxic substance or harmful physical agent. This changedoes not alter in any way the requirements of the regulation, but insteadindicates that a chemical inventory is an acceptable compliance alternativeto the keeping of production records, shipping records, invoices, batchcards or other records containing chemical identities. It should also benoted that the Hazard Communication standard requires employers in themanufacturing section of general industry to develop work area lists ofhazardous chemicals, as well as material safety data sheets (MSDS). Asbefore, if an employer has an MSDS on a substance or a monitoring record,it is not necessary for an employer to keep an inventory or other suchrecord.A second modification defines an exposure record as, in the absence ofenvironmental or biological monitoring records or MSDS's, a chemical inventoryor any other record which reveals where and when used and the identityof the toxic substance or harmful physical agent. This modification limitsthe number of ``other records'' that need be kept to those that most directlyrelate to employee exposures. Narrowing the definition of ``other records''eliminates the need to retain a massive quantity of routine documents suchas shipping records, purchase orders, invoices, etc. which only containthe chemical identity but do not describe where and when the chemical wasused. In the absence of more formal exposure records, these other recordsmay be the only record of employee exposures. As was the case with exposureto NIAX ESN, the preservation of production records which indicate whereand when a chemical was used can be crucial in identifying a problem chemicalin the workplace. This modified definition of exposure records preservesaccess to necessary records while eliminating the burden of maintainingrecords of limited occupational importance. With these modifications, theregulation's coverage of exposure records should not pose an excessivecompliance burden to any of the complaining industries or employers, yetshould fulfill the underlying purposes of the regulation.The 1980 rule also included in its definition of ``exposure record'', ``biologicalmonitoring results which directly assess the absorption of a substanceor agent by body systems (e.g., the level of a chemical in the blood, urine,breath, hair, fingernails, etc.) but not including results which assessthe biological effect of a substance or agent.'' In response to commentsthat there are some privacy concerns connected with biological monitoringresults, OSHA in its 1982 proposal narrowed this provision to include only``biological monitoring results which are designated as exposure recordsby specific occupational safety and health standards.''The AFL-CIO challenged the biological monitoring modification assertingit would unduly remove union access to an important body of exposure information.They stated that ``it is important that unions have direct access to thisinformation to assess the extent of workplace exposures'' (Ex. 59, p. 10).Ms. Margaret Seminario (AFL-CIO) also stated at the hearings that unionaccess to this information is necessary in support of the union role inOSHA standard-setting processes (Tr. 77).In view of the AFL-CIO position and the absence of any industrial objection,and since no specific evidence was presented indicating that the 1980 biologicalmonitoring provision had actually caused the release of information forwhich there were justifiable privacy concerns, OSHA has determined thatit is appropriate to retain the 1980 provision with minor modificationsdiscussed as follows.However, both OSHA and the AFL-CIO agree that certain biological monitoringresults, such as those which measure levels of alcohol or drugs in theblood, do deserve confidential treatment (Tr. 78). OSHA, therefore, ismodifying the biological monitoring provision to exclude from the definitionof ``exposure record'' biological monitoring tests which assess an employee'suse of alcohol or drugs. Many commenters argued that MSDS's should not be considered ``employeeexposure records'' (Exs. 4-11, 4-36, 4-37, 4-55, 4-56, 4-79, 4-95). Theynoted that OSHA's Hazard Communication standard deals with MSDS's (Ex.4-79), that MSDS's are neither a quantitative or qualitative indicationof exposure (Ex. 4-37), and that MSDS's are developed for many safe substances(Ex. 4-76). OSHA does not agree with the first two arguments. First, the Hazard Communicationstandard (29 1910.1200) presently applies only to manufacturing industries(see 48 FR 53280, November 25, 1983), whereas the Records Access regulationapplies to all general industry, construction and maritime employmentswhere there is employee exposure to toxic substances or harmful physicalagents. Therefore, yielding to the Hazard Communication standard couldpreclude important employee access to MSDS's in non-manufacturing employments.Second, OSHA does not accept the argument that the information containedin MSDS's does not supply useful exposure and health data. MSDS's normallycontain information on the identity of a chemical, its known toxic properties,signs and symptoms of over-exposure, personal protection precautions, andappropriate first and procedures. Access to this information is necessaryto ensure that employees are properly protected against the hazardous propertiesof the chemical present. However, OSHA does agree that employers do generate MSDS's for productswhich are not toxic in the common usage of that term. Customers often demandMSDS's for all products purchased, regardless of toxicity, and that themandatory retention of these MSDS's would serve little occupational healthpurpose. Therefore OSHA has modified the MSDS provision under the definitionof ``exposure record'' (paragraph (c)(5)(iii)) to read ``Material safetydata sheets indicating that the material may pose a hazard to human health.''This modification is consistent with the MSDS provision under the rule'sdefinition of ``toxic substance or harmful physical agent'' (paragraph(c)(13)(iii)). As previously noted, OSHA will continue to examine thisissue. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. </ITAG><T3/>Employee Medical Record. The proposal included three limited exclusions from the definition of employeemedical record. First, the 1980 definition included all employee X-rays,regardless of the purpose for which they were taken. The proposal wouldhave modified this requirement by considering only those X-rays taken forthe purposes of establishing a baseline or determining specific occupationalillness as part of the medical record. This revision would primarily removefrom coverage X-rays taken to detect or treat broken bones due to fallsor other traumatic occurrences. This modification was favored by severalcommenter (Exs. 4-27, 4-30, 4-60, 4-68, 4-79). The AFL-CIO objected to this revision, noting that X-rays of broken bonescould be related to chemical exposures (Tr. 404-406). However, OSHA continuesto believe that even in such cases where chemical exposures do cause fallsresulting in broken bones, written records of the diagnosis and necessarymedical treatment would be adequate for epidemiologic purposes. Second, the proposal added paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) to clarify that OSHAdid not consider certain first aid records to be a part of the employee'smedical record. OSHA based this clarification on the assertion that, likeX-rays of traumatic injuries, first aid records are not typically usedto detect occupational disease (Exs. 4-62, 4-76, 4-82, 4-109; Tr. 831).However, the proposal provided that if a first aid record was made by aphysician or otherwise became part of an individual worker's medical record,it would then be considered part of the medical record and subject to theregulation's retention and access provisions. Several commenters objected to this modification arguing that first aidrecords are indeed important in the detection of occupational diseases,and that any exemption for first aid records would tempt employers to classifytreatment of significant injuries and illnesses as ``first aid'' (Exs.4-24, 4-38; Tr. 188, 765, 850, 949, 1034, 1042). The International Associationof Machinists and Aerospace workers noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">We also feel that your proposal for the exemption of first aid recordsfrom access unless specifically made by a physician is in error. In manycases, gas inhalations are recorded as first aid cases by industry. Thesegas inhalation cases result from exposure to many varied chemicals in theworkplace. In many cases, physicians do not fill out these first aid reportsespecially if they occur on the off-shifts. The responsibility for fillingout the first aid forms may lie with a nurse, medical technician or supervisor* * * First aid reports such as gas inhalations can prove to be usefulif an employee is continually exposed to a particular chemical. Trendscan be followed and they could give insight to any problems an employeemay have due to his/her workplace exposure. (Ex. 4-38, pp. 3-4)</ITAG>Mr. Daniel Edwards (OCAW) further testified.<ITAG tagnum="21">OCAW has some concern about removing first aid and emergency treatmentcases from the definition of records. There seems already to be a problemin some industries where employers are recording many relatively severeinjuries as first aid to avoid reporting them in the OSHA 200 Form. (Tr.188)</ITAG>Since this testimony indicates that access to first aid data can in someinstances be of occupational health value, OSHA has decided not to removefirst aid records from the definition of ``employee medical record.'' However,OSHA has also decided that requiring the long-term retention of vast amountsof data concerning the treatment of relatively minor traumatic injuriessuch as cuts, scrapes and bruises would be of little overall benefit tothe occupational safety and health purposes of the standard. OSHA alsonoted the statutory exclusion of first aid records in the keeping of injuryand illness logs under section 8(c)(2) of the Act. This Section specificallystates that records of injuries or illnesses involving loss of consciousness,restriction of work or motion, or transfer to another job are not consideredfirst aid records.Therefore, although access to these records will continue to be mandated,the regulation will not require the records to be kept beyond what is normalpractice absent the rule. Since these records are created by employersfor some administrative or medical purpose other than compliance with thisrule, it is reasonable to assume that employers maintain this informationfor some extended period of time during which it would be available foranalysis. Further, to preclude undue restriction of employee access toimportant medical information through the recording of the treatment ofrelatively severe injuries as ``first aid,'' OSHA has modified the firstaid provision to indicate that first aid records are records of one-timetreatment and subsequent observation of minor scratches, cuts, burns, splintersand the like, which do not involve medical treatment, loss of consciousness,restriction of work or motion, or transfer to another job. Therefore, arecord of an injury or illness involving serious incapacitation, such asloss of consciousness, restriction of work or motion, or transfer to anotherjob, would not be considered a ``first aid'' record regardless of whetheror not the record was created by a physician.The final regulation therefore includes first aid records within the paragraph(c)(6) definition of ``employee medical record,'' but exempts in paragraph(d)(1)(i), ``First aid records (not including medical histories) of one-timetreatment and subsequent observation of minor scratches, cuts, burns, splintersand the like which do not involve medical treatment, loss of consciousness,restriction of work or motion, or transfer to another job, if made on-siteby a non-physician and if maintained separately from the employer's medicalprogram and its records'' from the long-term retention periods mandatedfor employee medical records.The third proposed exclusion from the definition of ``employee medicalrecord'' involved ``records created solely in preparation for litigationwhich are privileged from discovery under the applicable rules of procedureor evidence.'' This modification incorporated an interpretation that hadalready been made with respect to the 1980 standard. The purpose of thisexclusion was to make clear that the regulation is not meant to providea route around local rules of discovery or evidence when the claim to whichthe record in question relates is being litigated and the record itselfis a product of the litigation. As OSHA explained when the interpretationwas first published:<ITAG tagnum="21">The question has been raised whether an employer must provide accessto records which are created solely in anticipation of litigation and whichare otherwise privileged from discovery under the prevailing rules of procedureor evidence. An example could be a medical opinion prepared for the employerfor purposes of aiding the employer's case by a company physician aftera workmen's compensation claim has been filed. It has been OSHA's interpretationthat the standard does not contemplate coverage of such a record if therecord would not otherwise be available to the employee or his attorneyin the litigation. On the other hand, the mere fact that a medical record(see definition at 29 CFR 1910.20(c)(6)) not originally created in anticipationof specific litigation will ultimately be used as evidence in a privatelegal proceeding does not put it outside the scope of the standard. (46FR 40490).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This continues to be OSHA's view of how the regulation should operateand is incorporated into the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Exposure</ITAG>The proposal would have deleted the definition of the term ``exposure''contained in paragraph (c)(8) of the 1980 regulation. The action was takento make this section consistent with the proposed changes in the scopeof the rule. Since the scope of the 1980 rule will be retained, the definitionof exposure contained in the 1980 regulation will also be retained forthe final regulation.Therefore ``exposure'' or ``exposed'' as defined in the final rule, means``that an employee is subjected to a toxic substance or harmful physicalagent in the course of employment through any route of entry (inhalation,ingestion, skin contact or absorption, etc.), and includes past exposureand potential (e.g., accidental or possible) exposure, but does not includesituations where the employer can demonstrate that the toxic substanceor harmful physical agent is not used, handled, stored, generated, or presentin the workplace in any manner different from typical non-occupationalsituations.''The preamble to the 1980 regulation explanied:<ITAG tagnum="21">This final standard thus does not apply to every situation where anychemical or hazard is present in the workplace. While the final rule presumptivelyapplies to all occupational exposures to toxic substances and harmful physicalagents, the agency does not intend to cover situations where the employercan demonstrate that an employee is solely exposed to general environmentalpollution, or to casual use of consumer products. For example, basic chemicalmanufacturing processes and abnormal exposures to heat, noise, and vibrationare covered by the rule, but typical office working conditions are not.The applicability of the standard does not, however, depend on any showingthat the level of actual exposure to a toxic substance or harmful physicalagent is particularly excessive, but rather on the unique fact of occupationalexposure. (45 FR 35265)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This continues to be OSHA's interpretation of the degree of exposurenecessary to trigger the requirements of the rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Specific Chemical Identity</ITAG>A definition of ``specific chemical identity'' (paragraph (c)(11)) wasnot included in either the 1980 regulation or the proposed revisions. Thedefinition is included in the final rule to indicate the kind of informationcovered by the access and preservation provisions permitted to be withheldif judged by the employer to be trade secret. Access to trade secret ``specificchemical identity'' information is governed by the procedures specifiedin paragraph (F).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Specific Written Consent</ITAG>The definition of ``specific written consent'' remained unchanged in theproposal except for a clarifying modification of the language indicatingthat ``specific written consent'' would not authorize the release of medicalinformation not in existence on the date of the written authorization unlessthe release of future information is expressly authorized. This modificationwas recommended by the CAC. This modification was uncontested in the recordand is therefore adopted for the final regulation (paragraph (c)(12)).<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Toxic Substance</ITAG>The 1980 rule required the retention and disclosure of exposure informationregarding any ``Toxic substance or harmful physical agent.'' ``toxic substance''was defined broadly, most notably by including any substance listed inthe NIOSH RTECS list_a compendium of over 39,000 chemicals. Many affectedparties have criticized RTECS as overinclusive. The definition of ``toxicsubstance'' was narrowed in the proposal to include only those chemicalson the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Registryof Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS) list which met certaintoxicological criteria.The 1980 regulation also defined as toxic any substance which ``is regulatedby any Federal law or rule due to a hazard to health.'' This provisionwas broadly interpreted by some to mean that all food ingredients are ``toxic''since they are substances regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.Mr. Sherwin Gardner (GMA) noted that ``this regulation does not discriminatebetween the few genuine hazards (eg: flour dust inhalation) and the vastmajority of safe food substances to which workers are exposed'' (Ex. 3-55,p. 1). This was not OSHA's original intent, which was to cover such regulatedsubstances as air and water pollutants and other health hazards, most,if not all, of which were already included within RTECS. The proposal thereforedeleted this provision because it is essentially duplicative and potentiallyconfusing, and the final regulation also does not contain this provision.The ``toxic substance'' definition in the 1980 rule also included any substancewhich ``has yielded positive evidence of an acute or chronic health hazardin human, animal, or other biological testing conducted by, or known to,the employer,'' ((c)(11)(iii)) and any substance which ``has a materialsafety data sheet available to the employer indicating that the materialmay pose a hazard to human health'' ((c)(11)(iv)). These provisions wereunchanged in the proposal, except to reference them to the toxicologicalcriteria contained in paragraph (c)(10)(iii). For the reasons stated below,these provisions have reverted to their original form.As stated, the core of the 1980 ``toxic substance'' definition was itsinclusion of any substance on the NIOSH RTECS list. The proposed modificationof (c)(11)(ii) (renumbered as (c)(10)(iii)) retained the use of RTECS asa basic source of information, but greatly limited its application by addingspecific toxicity criteria designed to indicate whether or not a substancewould likely pose an occupational health risk. To come under the definitionof ``toxic substance'' a substance would not only have to be listed inRTECS but would have to fulfill one of the following conditions: (1) Bereported to cause human toxicity at any dose level; (2) be reported tocause cancer or reproductive effects in animals at any dose level; (3)have a reported oral rat LD50 (that dose required to kill 50% of the treatedanimals) of less than 500 milligrams per kilogram of body weight; (4) havea reported rabbit skin contact LD50 of less than 1000 milligrams per kilogramof body weight; or (5) have a reported rat inhalation LC50 (that atmosphericconcentration required to kill 50% of the exposed animals) of less than2000 parts per million of gas or vapor, or less than 20 milligrams perliter of mist, fume or dust. Conditions (3), (4) and (5) were adopted fromthe ``toxic chemical'' definition in the American National Standards Institute'sdocument, ``American National Standard for the Precautionary Labeling ofHazardous Industrial Chemicals'' (ANSIZ129.1-1976).At OSHA's request, NIOSH generated from RTECS a list designed to meet thesecriteria (Ex. 3-88). This list of 3,492 substances represented a greaterthan 90 percent decrease in the number of chemicals specified under the``toxic substance'' definition.The proposed definition of ``toxic substance'' was a major issue in therulemaking, and much testimony was received ranging from further restrictionof the definition to include only OSHA regulated substances (e.g., CMA,Tr. 651) to retaining the 1980 definition, including the entire RTECS listing(e.g., Cal/OSHA, Tr. 429-435). Industry representatives generally supportedthe proposal or favored a more restrictive approach (Exs. 4-1, 4-3, 4-10,4-11, 4-17, 4-28, 4-30, 4-40, 4-41, 4-54, 4-59, 4-60, 4-62, 4-66, 4-68,4-69, 4-79, 4-91, 4-92, 4-95, 4-102, 4-106, 4-107, 4-109, 4-110, 4-113;Tr. 651, 731, 830), while labor representatives advocated a broadly inclusivedefinition (Exs. 4-38, 4-43, 4-77, 4-98; Tr. 104, 151, 189, 334, 374, 429,758, 1022, 1077).The following comments are characteristic of the industry position:<ITAG tagnum="21">We strongly endorse OSHA's decision to narrow the definition of ``toxicsubstance.'' The approach of the May 1980 rule_that any substance listedin the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (``RTECS'') isa toxic substance_was vastly overbroad and covered many substances thatcould not reasonably be considered toxic as used in the workplace. (CMA,Ex. 4-62, p. 10)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA, we believe, demonstrated sound scientific judgment in its definitionsof ``employee'' and ``toxic substance.'' We are particularly impressedwith OSHA's intention of providing employers with a specific list of substancescovered by its rule. This extraction from the NIOSH Registry of Toxic Substanceswill be of great assistance to smaller employers and help preserve thescarce resources of large employers by eliminating the need for each employerto perform its own extraction. (American Cyanamid, Ex. 4-63, p. 1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed revision of the term ``toxic substance'' in paragraph(c)(10) is an important improvement in the regulation, but is still toobroad. For example, under the proposed definition a single report thata substance appearing in RTECS may cause cancer in animals at very highdoses would be sufficient to cause the substance to be considered ``toxic'',thereby triggering the rule. (SOCMA, Ex. 4-69, p. 2)</ITAG>In their opposition to the proposed definition, labor leaders and publichealth officials stated that it would both exclude many dangerous chemicalsfrom coverage and frustrate one of the principal purposes of the accessregulation_the detection of previously unknown occupational diseases. TheAFL-CIO testified to this point as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The record clearly shows that these (OSHA) criteria, and their applicationto the RTECS list fail to encompass a broad range of toxic effects, andexclude vast numbers of known and potential hazards * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The (ANSI) criteria fail to consider the results of toxicity testsconducted in species other than rats and albino rabbits, (such as mice,guinea pigs, etc.), and ignore organ specific effects such as neurotoxicity,liver toxicity or kidney toxicity, if acute mortality is not the outcome(Exs. 6, 16, 17; Tr. 29, 32). Thus many toxic substances are missing usingthese restrictive animal toxicity criteria. (Exs. 6, 16, 17; Tr. 128).While the proposed language theoretically includes substances with humanhealth effects, in practice such substances are excluded, since RTECS generallydoes a poor job of reporting human health effects. (Exs. 6, 15, 16, 17;Tr. 115). Therefore, application of ``human health effects'' criteria tothe RTECS list fails to catch many toxic substances (Tr. 115). (AFL-CIO,Ex. 59, 6-7) </ITAG>Further, Dr. James Melius of NIOSH testified: <ITAG tagnum="21">A major problem with the access and retention being based on currentknowledge of toxicity (is the) likelihood that what we now consider tobe a non-toxic substance will later be found to be a substantially toxic(one). We all have many examples of that from our experience in occupationalhealth, asbestos, vinyl chloride, DBCP, etc.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, under the proposed regulation, the changes in the regulation,the records necessary for an epidemiological or medical study of the humantoxicity of a formerly non-toxic compound might not be available * * *  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Similarly, workers with access to the records might have discoveredclues to the toxicity of the substance much before it came to our attentionin other ways * * *   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, NIOSH believes that OSHA's plan to use the set of toxicologicalcriteria applied to RTECS would not adequately identify substances whichcould cause significant occupational health hazards. (NIOSH, Tr. 103-104).</ITAG>Similarly, Mr. Peter Weiner (Cal/OSHA) observed: <ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA doesn't know nor does any other scientist, really, whether theRTECS list is over-inclusive, under-inclusive or just right. The entirepurpose of the rule is to overcome the dangers of under-regulation of useand exposure by at least requiring the maintenance of existing, not new,exposure and medical records on the vast sea of chemicals upon which theship of science has yet to chart a safe course.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The criticism of RTECS on the basis of including common substancessuch as sugar and salt is certainly misplaced. Non-occupational exposuresare not covered and it is clear from the record that there can be instanceswhere common substances can be harmful in bulk quantities. (Tr. 431-432)</ITAG>The use of RTECS as a basis for the definition of ``toxic substance'' wasalso a major issue in the Louisiana Chemical Association court case whichwas decided while this rulemaking was underway. In upholding OSHA's original``toxic substance'' definition, the Court found: <ITAG tagnum="21">The Registry is a compilation of substances which have produced positiveresults in toxicity tests. Its editors make no attempt however to interpretcontradictory data or test results, and even include toxic effects producedin laboratory animals by means unlikely to occur in the workplace. Also,the Registry includes certain substances found in household use on a dailybasis such as table salt, sugar, lemon oil, Vitamins B and C, and bakingsoda. For each of the above enumerated substances not considered by thelaymen to be dangerous, however, are thousands of other chemicals and industrialcompounds, the toxic effects of which are immediate and severe. There areadditionally, tens of thousands of chemicals listed in the Registry, thelong term toxic effects of which are simply unknown. In short, the Registryis a listing of those chemicals research scientists will be keeping anespecially close eye on in attempting to identify the sources of occupationaldiseases. These are the chemicals presently considered to pose the greatestpotential threat as causal factors of occupational disease and illness* * * (Ex. 49) </ITAG>The court further stated that: <ITAG tagnum="21">In ``defining a class subject to regulation, `[t]he inclusion of areasonable margin to insure effective enforcement, will not put upon a[rule] otherwise valid, the stamp of invalidity.''' <T3>Mourning </T3>v. <T3>Family Publications Service, Inc., </T3>441 U.S. at 374, 93 S. Ct.,at 1663. (Ex. 49) </ITAG>Further, the Court has recognized the point made by OSHA that only recordsvoluntarily created by the employer are subject to retention under theAccess rule and, therefore, the rule cannot be considered as overly broador unduly burdensome. In the Court's opinion: <ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the records access rule, while including a ``reasonable marginto insure effective enforcement'' in its definition of ``toxic substance,''can hardly be said to ``grind with a rough edge.'' Strikingly absent fromthe plaintiff's brief has been any recognition of the critical ingredientof the records access rule_that it applies only to records created voluntarilyby employers * * * Considering the disclosure-type regulation found inthe records access rule, it poses no burden on the plaintiffs except tomaintain records they choose to compile. (Ex. 49) </ITAG>Other alternatives to the use of either the OSHA RTECS subset of 3500 substancesor the entire RTECS list were also explored as part of this rulemaking.Primarily, the alternative of expanding the OSHA RTECS subset through theuse of other less inclusive lists of toxic substances was investigated.OSHA's Dr. Leonard Vance specifically noted these alternatives in the openingstatement of the rulemaking hearing: <ITAG tagnum="21">There were comments both that irritants be added as a separate toxicologicalcriterion and that the OSHA and ACGIH lists be specifically referred. Weare presently looking at the appropriateness of including all OSHA/ACGIHlisted substances in the definition of toxic substance * * *   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It was also suggested that other lists, for example, the IARC andNTP cancer lists could be incorporated into the definition to assure thatno substances of obvious occupational health concern fall through the cracksof the definition. (Tr. 19) </ITAG>NIOSH also addressed this alternative, stating: <ITAG tagnum="21">The current use of the full RTECS file could be retained, or lessstringent toxicological criteria could be applied to RTECS to generatea list providing better coverage. A list generated from RTECS could alsobe combined with other lists, including at least the OSHA-regulated substancesand the National Toxicology Program Annual Report with consideration givento including also the ACGIH TLV list and the International Agency for Researchon Cancer (IARC) evaluation chemical list. (Ex. 4-70, p. 5) </ITAG>This alternative did not receive support from hearing participants. Mr.William Danchuck, testifying on behalf of the Chemical Manufacturers' Associationnoted: <ITAG tagnum="21">If you try to list it, either with 3900 or if you try to list it withCalifornia's 700 or West Virginia's 600, you're going to find yourselfwith things falling through the cracks and we don't want that as much asyou don't want that. (Tr. 672) </ITAG>The AFL-CIO also commented: <ITAG tagnum="21">Inclusion of OSHA regulated substances, the ACGIH TLV's IARC carcinogens,etc. will only cover substances for which adverse health effects have beenfirmly established. However, substances for which the health effects areonly suspect would remain excluded. Such an approach would completely undermineone of the standard's main purposes_the development of an adequate database for the future evaluation of workplace hazards. (Ex. 59, p. 7) </ITAG>On the basis of these and other comments OSHA has decided that supplementingthe toxicological criteria with other lists would not be adequate in defining``toxic substance'' for the purposes of this regulation.   CMA supported as an alternative the use of professional judgment in determiningwhich substances should be considered ``toxic'' for the purpose of thisrule: <ITAG tagnum="21">While the approach of the July 13 proposal is an improvement, it stillfails to recognize the high degree of professional judgment required tomake a sound decision as to whether a substance could pose a chronic healthhazard in a particular workplace environment. No simple citation of publishedlists or uncritical reliance on reported test results can avoid the needfor judgment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA should take a performance-oriented approach consistent with thehazard communication standard. As we have argued in that proceeding, coverageof chemicals presenting chronic health hazards should be limited to chemicalswhich are generally recognized, on the basis of well-established scientificevidence, to lead to serious adverse health effects in employees. (Ex 4-62,pp. 10-11)</ITAG>Evidence from a 1972 survey presented in the rulemaking for the 1980 regulationindicated that only 3.1% of all industrial plants used industrial hygieneservices. In the manufacturing and chemical industries, where toxic substanceexposures are most likely to occur, the percentages were 12.4% and 29.0%respectively (45 FR 35255). While these percentages have undoubtedly increasedin the last decade, a reliance on professional judgment would still clearlyfail to provide adequate benefits to workers in a substantial majorityof industrial plants where services of health professionals are not normallyavailable. For most employers, therefore, the approach of using the RTECSlist is preferable. In light of the above testimony and decisional authority, OSHA has decidedto retain the use of RTECS in defining the term ``toxic substance'' (paragraph(c)(13)(i)). A broad definition of ``toxic substance'' is desirable dueto the regulation's hazards detection orientation. RTECS is a readily availablesource which was designed for just such a purpose. The criteria for selectinga substance for inclusion on RTECS and the limitations on its use are fullyset forth in its introductory section (see 45 FR 35267). To the extentthat an employer has records relating to exposure to any of these substances,or there are medical records of employees exposed to any of these substances,prudent public health policy dictates that these records be kept and madeavailable in accordance with this regulation pending receipt of and actionon the recommendations of the working group. Otherwise, valuable informationconcerning substances with a documented potential for causing harm if misusedmay be irretrievably lost. A definition of ``Health professional'' has been added to this final regulation.This definition was not included in the 1980 Access rule but is added forthe purpose of clarity. A ``Health professional'' means a physician, occupationalnurse, industrial hygienist, toxicologist, or epidemiologist providingmedical or other occupational health services to exposed employees. Healthprofessionals are afforded the opportunity to gain access to trade secretinformation in non-emergency situations when the need is demonstrated tobe legitimate. For non-emergencies, OSHA believes that access to tradesecret information lie in the treatment of an employee as a patient, inthe evaluation of workplace hazards, and in their potential use as datafor epidemiological studies. Physician and nurse access is appropriatefor use in evaluation of the record in terms of continuing health careor who suspects that a patient's health problems may be the result of chemicalexposure. In addition, both physicians and nurses have access to tradesecret information in emergency situations for the same reasons. Industrial hygienists, where utilized, may require chemical identity informationin order to access the conditions under which the hazardous situation aroseand to confirm the existence of an exposure history. Epidemiologists and toxicologists may require trade secret data in orderto link patterns of disease with exposure to a particular chemical. C. Retention Periods.The 1980 regulation required exposure and analysis records to be kept forthirty years and medical records to be kept for the duration of employmentplus thirty years. These periods were chosen to reflect the latency periodsassociated with some occupational diseases, most notably cancer. Affected parties, construction industry employers in particular, expressedconcern over the value and expense of retaining records of short-term employeesfor the full thirty year periods (See Exs. 3-36, 4-30; Docket H-112C, Ex.2-42A). They argued that exposure and medical records of short-term employeeswould likely not be of occupational health benefit, since in twenty orthirty years it would be nearly impossible for a researcher to trace thecause of an occupational disease to short-term employment at a particularjob site when the employee had worked at dozens of essentially similarjob sites. It would also be nearly impossible to locate the former employeesshould follow-up be necessary. In response, OSHA proposed exempting from the retention requirements anyindividually identified medical records of short-term (i.e., less thanone year) employees provided these employees were instead given a copyof their records upon termination of employment. The agency explained thatalthough records of short-term employees may often be of future occupationalhealth significance, the total burdens of maintaining these records didnot appear to be justified. Also based on comments from construction industry employers that due tothe nature of construction employment extensive recordkeeping would undulyburden employers (Docket H-112C, Exs. 2-3, 2-6A, 2-14), OSHA proposed tomodify the current regulation's retention requirements for medical recordsgenerated and maintained by construction industry employers to the durationof an employee's employment (regardless of duration) provided that therecord is turned over to the employee upon termination of employment. Thismodification would not apply, however, to any medical records retentionrequirements contained in substance-specific OSHA standards.In addition, OSHA proposed changing the retention period for medical recordsto length of employment plus 5 years, but in no event less than thirtyyears after the beginning of employment. This modification was designedto reduce the burden of the current rule by shortening the outer limitof how long medical records of permanent employees will have to be keptwhile retaining the benefit of long-term records retention.Several interested parties opposed any reduction in the required recordsretention periods (Ex. 4-9, 4-22, 4-24, 4-38, 4-43, 4-68, 4-70, 4-77, 4-78,4-98, 4-111; Tr. 105, 136, 148, 191, 380, 435, 485, 509, 766, 921, 1026,1033, 1082). In its written comments, NIOSH noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">NIOSH is very concerned about OSHA's proposal to limit the retentionof medical records * * * This change could seriously undermine the improvementof the epidemiological data base used to identify occupational illnessesand injuries. There has been much criticism of the reliance on animal studiesas a basis for regulation of substances. It is imperative that the bestpossible date base of human experience be available. Short-changing thesource materials for epidemiological studies would serve only to underminethe scientific basis for health and safety regulations. This, in turn,would affect the ability of NIOSH and other occupational health researchgroups to conduct epidemiological studies * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, NIOSH recommends that no changes be made in the generalmedical record retention time provisions of the current regulation andthat no limitation of this provision be made based on plant size. It hasbeen our experience that most employers retain medical records for longperiods of time after employment for other reasons. Therefore, we do notbelieve that the current regulation imposes inordinate extra burden beyondthe common practice of most industries. (Ex. 4-70, pp. 6, 8)</ITAG>The American Public Health Association (APHA) also commented on this issueas follow:<ITAG tagnum="21">Medical records and their retention are a particular concern for theAPHA because of our interest in research and epidemiology.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposal requires only five years retention for workers who hadput in 25 years before retirement. This would result in more rapid destructionof records of long-term employees_presumed to have more cumulative exposure.At the other end of the spectrum, the proposal uses a minimum of one yearof employment to trigger the retention of records * * * For epidemiologicstudies the trigger time should be much shorter. For example, in dibromochloropropane(DBCP) morbidity studies, work exposure for less than one year was shownto cause significant disease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, there is no evidence that these rules represent an improvementover existing provisions. (Ex. 14, pp. 5-7)</ITAG>Other commenters, however, supported the proposed reductions (Exs. 4-10,4-17, 4-20, 4-35, 4-39, 4-41, 4-52, 4-54, 14-58, 4-62, 4-66, 4-67, 4-76,4-80, 4-97, 4-100, 4-109). The Marathon Oil Company commented:<ITAG tagnum="21">While we are in favor of the OSHA's attempt in this proposed ruleto make the retention period shorter in some cases, it still has saddledemployers with a great and costly burden. More specifically, the retentionperiod for medical records is unduly burdensome. As part of retention,such things as allergy shot records, hay fever prescriptions, and mosthealth insurance payments, etc., etc., will have to be retained for theduration of employment plus five years, with a minimum retention of thirtyyears. Employers literally will have to rent buildings to store everythingOSHA requires us to save. (Ex. 4-39, pp. 4-5)</ITAG>However, several employers testified that they would maintain employeemedical records for extended periods of time absent the standard (Ex. 4-1,4-11, 4-111; Tr. 108, 748). For instance, Dow Chemical requires that theirindustrial hygiene records, medical records, and personnel records be maintainedfor a period of 75 years after the date of employment (Ex. 4-111, p. 2).Dr. John Dougherty, M.D. (Celanese Corporation) and Mr. William A. Danchuck(United States Steel Corporation), both testifying for CMA, noted thattheir companies do not contemplate destroying employee medical and exposurerecords (Tr. 748-749).Based on the evidence submitted, OSHA has determined that the proposedreduction in the retention period for medical records is not justified.The long-term retention of records is necessary to provide a data basefor the detection of occupational diseases that may not manifest themselvesfor many years after onset of exposure.Additionally, OSHA is persuaded by evidence that modern computerized recordkeepingsystems can significantly reduce long-term recordkeeping costs (Tr. 1082).Therefore, the revised Access rule retains the duration of employment plusthirty years retention requirement of the 1980 regulation. However, asdiscussed earlier under ``employee medical record,'' first aid recordsneed not be retained beyond normal practice.OSHA's proposal to exclude the records of short-term employees was opposedby several parties (Exs. 17, 59; Tr. 118, 191, 381, 437, 767). Mr. PeterWeiner (Cal/OSHA) noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">There are many examples of short-term exposures which have provedharmful to human health. Former Assistant Secretary Dr. Morton Corn hasnoted that Kepone workers were exposed to Kepone for a maximum of 16 monthsand usually less, yet sustained irreversible and tragic disease as a consequence* * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The records of short-term employes can be extremely useful in research.For example, Dr. Roger Glass and his colleagues were able to use company-maintainedrecords of short-term exposures of field applicators to dibromochloropropaneis studying sperm count depression in these applicators. Indeed, it wasfound that short-term exposure created specifically significant depressionsin sperm count among such workers. (Ex. 17, pp. 49-51)</ITAG>Other commenters, however, supported the proposed revision (Exs. 4-5, 4-27,4-30, 4-60, 4-66, 4-70, 4-79, 4-80, 4-82, 4-106, 4-109). The Pennzoil Companystated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Pennzoil supports revisions to the records retention rules, especiallythe changes affecting transient or short-term employees (i.e., those withless than one year of service) * * * Therefore, complex records systemsneed not be maintained for short-term employees, provided that they aregiven their records when they leave the employ * * * we believe that thebasic purpose of the rule will be served by permitting employers to handover medical records to short-term employees. This improvement will reducethe burdens incumbent in a mandatory, extended preservation of such records,and at the same time would provide the transient employees with usefulmedical information for future use. (Ex. 4-30, pp. 4-5)</ITAG>After considering both arguments, OSHA believes that although medical recordsof short-term employees may be valuable in some instances in the detectionof occupational disease, this would not generally be the case. Therefore,OSHA is providing the option to employers of short-term employees to eithermaintain the medical records of short-term employees for the duration ofemployment plus 30 years, or provide these employees a copy of their medicalrecord upon termination of employment, with no further retention required.Providing short-term employees with copies of their medical records upontermination of employment does not eliminate all employer records of occupationalinjuries and illnesses for short-term employees. Under 29 CFR Part 1904,employers are required to record all occupational injuries and illnesseson the OSHA 200 Log and the OSHA 101 Supplementary Record. For short-termemployees who suffered an occupational injury or illness during their employment,the OSHA 200 and OSHA 101 Forms are a record the employer maintains afterthe medical records are given to the employee, and can be examined if theneed arises.The short-term employee retention exemption should not reduce the overallbenefits of the regulation. Having the medical record travel with the employeewill better inform that employee of his or her health status and greatlyassist the development of a work-life exposure history for that employee.Additionally, it is important to note that the records of long-term employeeswill be available for epidemiologic study, thus providing a data base forthe study of substances to which short-term employees are likewise exposed.D. Access to RecordsThe 1980 regulation required that requested records be made available within15 days of the request. However, several commenters argued that situationsmay arise where it is not possible to comply with the fifteen day limit(Exs. 3-27, 3-28). Records may be stored at locations remote from wherethe request is made, or extraordinarily large numbers of records may berequested.The proposed modification of paragraph (e)(1)(i) clarified OSHA's intentin requiring records to be made available within 15 working days. The modification,which incorporated a previous OSHA interpretation (46 FR 40490), allowedemployers to exceed the 15 day limit providing that: (1) It is not reasonablypossible to fulfill the request within 15 days; and (2) within the 15 dayperiod the employer apprises the requesting party of the reasons for thedelay and provides an approximation of when the requested records willbe available. The CAC recommended that OSHA explicitly require the 15 daylimit with regard to the employer's obligation to notify the requestingparty of any reasons for delay.  Several commenters favored this revision (Exs. 4-11, 4-20, 4-29, 4-62,4-79, 4-80, 4-82, 4-95). Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">We support the changes in paragraph (e) which recognize the impossibilityof immediate access to all data. This is particularly true in multisiteorganizations. For example, some of the analyses and compilations of theraw data of the kind which may be most useful to an inquirer likely willnot be at the plant site, but at a corporate office or another location.Thus the proposal to acknowledge the request promptly and to supply thedata in a reasonable time frame is appropriate. This limitation is particularlynecessary in view of the broad requirements of (the regulation). (Ex. 4-11,p. 6)</ITAG>The Chemical Manufacturers Association also noted: <ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA has appropriately taken notice of the fact that it is sometimesimpossible for an employer to make exposure and medical records availablewithin 15 days of the request and that the assistance of the requestermay be needed to locate records. Since large numbers of documents may begenerated during the lengthy retention periods, and large numbers of employeesmay be requesting records at a given time (especially if designated representativesare entitled to access), these provisions for extension of the 15-day responseperiod are necessary to make this rule workable. (Ex. 4-62, p. 20)</ITAG>Union representatives and Cal/OSHA objected to the proposed modificationof the 15-day requirement. (Exs. 4-38; Tr. 192, 383-384, 440-441, 887-888;Ex. 59, pp. 13-14). The AFL-CIO noted that ``the extension, however, isopen-ended, and there is no guidance provided on what constitutes justcause for an extension'', and that ``employers often delay transmittalof requested information as long as possible, even in the presence of aregulatory time limit'' (Ex. 59, p. 13).  However, OSHA is not convinced that a return to the firm 15-day limit iswarranted. The agency has provided guidance on what constitutes just causefor an extension by requiring that the cause be ``reasonable.'' In issuingthe interpretation, OSHA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21"> * * * what is a ``reasonable'' time will vary from situation to situation.Factors such as the location of requested records, the number of pendingcompeting requests for records, the scope of a request and the availabilityof technical personnel necessary to process the request, are all relevantin determining what is a reasonable time. It is our expectation, however,that the vast majority of requests for records can be satisfied within15 days, and the standard established this as a mandatory requirement ** *.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, as long as an employer is making a diligent, good faith effortto provide requested records as soon as possible, and is keeping the employeeor employee representative informed of any reasons for delay, OSHA willnot cite for violations of the standard. (46 FR 40490)</ITAG>OSHA therefore has adopted the proposed provision in the final rule.  OSHA has also adopted the proposed paragraph (e)(1)(ii), which was addedin the proposal to indicate that an employer may require of the requestingparty reasonable information to assist the employer in the location oridentification of requested records. This information would assist employersin locating requested records and will avoid extensive searches of recordsby employers to determine which specific records are covered by a request.This information is to be used only for locating records, not for the purposesof restricting or preventing access to records to which the employee isotherwise entitled. OSHA has also adopted a CAC recommendation that, inthis case, only information related to locating the record may be requestedby the employer.  The final regulation also includes proposed paragraph (e)(1)(iv). Thisparagraph states that ``in the case of an original X-ray, the employermay restrict access to on-site examination or make other suitable arrangementsfor the temporary loan of the X-ray.'' This modification, which incorporatesa prior official interpretation provided to the DuPont Company (Ex. 3-65),is intended to clarify an employer's responsibility in providing accessto X-rays. Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of the regulation the employer isrequired to provide an employee a copy of the record, or make copying facilitiesavailable to the requestor. However, in the case of X-rays a copy is notinterchangeable with the original. Also, specialized equipment is requiredfor copying X-rays, and this equipment is not normally available to employers(see Exs. 3-32, 3-65). This modification indicates that the copying provisionsof the rule are intended to apply to the parts of the employee medicalrecord which can be easily photocopied or reproduced, and not to X-rays.In requiring ``other suitable arrangements'' if on-site examination cannotbe arranged, it is expected that accepted medical practices for makingX-rays available to other physicians or to employees will be followed.This modification also responds to concerns that limiting access solelyto on-site examination would discourage review of X-rays by employee physicians(Tr. 501; Ex. 55;).  A clarifying modification was also proposed for paragraph (e)(2) concerningemployee and designated representative access to records. The 1980 regulationrequired employers to provide an employee or designated representativeaccess to exposure records of all employees having exposures similar tothose of the subject employee. This provision was capable of overly broadinterpretation, suggesting employee and designated representative rightsof access to potentially large numbers of duplicative records, or recordsof exposures at similar workplaces at distant plants and locations. However,allowing access to exposure records of similarly exposed employees wasintended only as an alternative when personally identified or workplaceexposure records are inadequate to determine the amount and nature of toxicsubstances or harmful physical agents to which the employee is or has beenexposed. The proposal therefore permitted access to exposure records ofother employees only in the absence of personal exposure or workplace recordsadequate to determine the nature of an employee's exposure, and only tothe extent necessary to determine the subject employee's exposure adequately. This provision incorporates a previous interpretation of the 1980 regulationpublished by OSHA on August 7, 1981 (46 FR 40490). The interpretation statedthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">The standard requires that employees and designated representativesbe provided access to ``exposure records of other employees with past orpresent job duties or working conditions related to or similar to thoseof the employee.'' 29 CFR 1910.20(e)(2)(i)(B). The basic purpose of thisrequirement is to assure that an employee may obtain access to relevantexposure information of other employees in similar working conditions.Access to this information is necessary when monitoring has been conductedon a representative or sample basis where not all employees are personallymonitored. See 45 FR 35272. The obligation on the employer is to conducta good faith, diligent search for such records, but there is no intentthat the search be ``heroic'' or unusually disruptive to the employer'soperation. For example, if access to exposure records of other employeesat the requesting employee's workplace adequately indicates the natureof the employee's exposure, access to records of other workplaces neednot be provided. However, if adequate exposure records do not exist atthe requesting employee's workplace, but are known to exist at some otherworkplace of the employer where similar work is performed, access to thisinformation must be provided.</ITAG>There was no opposition to this interpretation and proposed modificationpresented during the rulemaking. Because it is a reasonable and cost-effectiveapproach to achieving the purpose of the records access rule, OSHA hasadopted the proposed provision for the final regulation.<T3>E. OSHA Access</T3>The 1980 regulation required that each employer, upon request, provide``immediate'' access to records for authorized OSHA employees. The proposalsubstituted the word ``prompt,'' which reflects OSHA's intent that theemployer must not unduly delay providing the requested records to the requestingOSHA official, but, consistent with whatever legal protections are availableto the employer, makes them available to OSHA as soon as possible. Thephrase ``without derogation of any constitutional and statutory rightsthat the employer chooses to exercise'' was proposed to be added to makeexplicit OSHA's recognition that its access to records takes place againsta background of Fourth Amendment law, particularly as explicated in <T3>Marshall </T3>v. <T3>Barlow's, Inc., </T3>436 U.S. 307 (1978). Although issuance of the1980 regulation was designed to promote voluntary compliance with OSHAaccess requests, the Agency will seek a search warrant or subpoena, asappropriate, if an employer exercises his right to require that OSHA resortto legal process before obtaining such access. As the District Court inthe <T3>Louisiana Chemical </T3>case found, OSHA fully intended to respectthese Fourth Amendment rights all along.Mr. Peter Weiner (Cal/OSHA) commented that this modification could be misinterpretedto mean that the employer could assert rights granted by state law as takingprecedence over this OSHA standard (Tr. 443). To preclude this potentialmisinterpretation, the proposed modification has been changed slightlyto ``without derogation of any rights under the Constitution or the OccupationalSafety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 65 <T3>et seq., </T3>that the employer chooses to exercise'' to better conveyOSHA's intent in this matter.<T3>F. Union Access to Records</T3>The 1980 regulation granted recognized or certified collective bargainingagents automatic status as designated representatives, without requiringindividual employee authorization, for purposes of access to exposure andanalysis records. The purpose of this special status was to assure thatunions would have ready access to exposure information so that they couldbetter represent the interests of their members in the occupational safetyand health area. Comparable special status was not granted with respectto medical records, however, because of the significantly greater privacyinterests involved. Several commenters questioned whether, under the OSHAct, unions should be treated preferentially to other designated representativeswho have to obtain written authorization to establish the agency relationship.Further, commenters have also complained that providing unions unconsentedaccess to employee exposure records enables union officials to burden employerswith large-scale records access requests and is best handled through traditionalcollective bargaining (DuPont, Ex. 3-33).In three 1982 decisions concerning union access to exposure and analysesrecords, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) held that unions dohave a right of access to these records since the information containedin the records is presumptively relevant to the union's role as collectivebargaining agent for unit employees. <T3>Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co., </T3>261 NLRB No. 2 (April 9, 1982);<T3>Colgate-Palmolive, Inc., </T3>261 NLRB No. 7 (April 9, 1982); <T3>Borden Chemical, a Division of Borden, Inc., </T3>261 NLRB No. 6 (April9, 1982). These decisions were affirmed by the United States Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit on June 30, 1983.Although no change to the union access provision was proposed, OSHA encouragedinterested parties to comment on whether a modification of the existingstandard either limiting or deleting the automatic status of unions asdesignated representatives would be appropriate in light of experienceunder the 1980 standard, the NLRB decisions, and considerations of safetyand health.Union officials and other participants testified against OSHA's deferringto NLRB on the issue of union access to records (Exs. 4-12, 4-24, 4-38,4-43; Tr. 163, 186, 194, 338, 387, 422, 771, 855, 879, 889, 892, 1019,1034, 1083). They argued that NLRB procedures take long periods of time(Tr. 194, 425); the union access rights under the 1980 regulation are greaterthan access rights granted by the NLRB (Tr. 339-340); the NLRB decisionsare not final, but are currently under appeal (Tr. 389, 856); proper functioningof the OSH Act depends upon union access to information (Tr. 389-390, 422-423);and that the NLRB does not establish standards, but instead makes decisionson individual cases (Tr. 425).Many commenters favored some restrictions on union access to records (Exs.4-17, 4-19, 4-20, 4-41, 4-49, 4-59, 4-60, 4-62, 4-66, 4-68, 4-69, 4-78,4-94, 4-95; Tr. 655, 1048) including deferral to NLRB. Evidence in therecord indicates that unions have used the 1980 standard to gain accessto large amounts of exposure information (Exs. 39B, 15 (App. 1); Tr. 204,328). Comments from industry witnesses indicated general concern aboutthe broad-based right of union representatives to demand access to allexposure records. Mr. William Danchuk, testifying on behalf of the ChemicalManufacturers Association, stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The provision for automatic designated representative status permitsthe misuse and misdirection of time and finances merely for the purposesof expediency. It permits unspecified and over-general inquiries whichobligate the expenditure of enormous resources by the employer withoutbenefitting the employee. (Tr. 658)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The issue here is whether we can accommodate in these economic timesthe wholesale request for information of this magnitude. (Tr. 661)</ITAG>Dr. John Dougherty, M.D., also speaking for CMA, further testified:<ITAG tagnum="21">I think before I ought to ask for any information on a plant, I'dwant to know * * * something about the working conditions in the plant.I'd be looking for specifics.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I think it's an attractive idea to think that if you ask for everythingand get everything and try to piece bits and pieces of everything together,you can make scientific progress, but science doesn't work that way.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unfortunately, in improving both activity of a plant or improvingthe health and safety of a plant, you have to start with an idea. You haveto start with a concept. (Tr. 665-666)</ITAG>Mr. Ronald Lang, Executive Director of the Synthetic Organic Chemical ManufacturersAssociation, Inc. (SOCMA), commented similarly:<ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the OSHA provision is subject to potential abuse by unionsas a method of harassing employers in connection with collective bargaining.A SOCMA member recently obtained a blanket request for records from a localof the International Chemical Workers Union which upon investigation provedto be made at the request of the international union * * * SOCMA has previouslysubmitted for the record evidence that the Oil, Chemical and Atomic WorkersInternational Union has urged its locals to submit blanket requests forrecords under OSHA's rule. It is noteworthy that in one of the NLRB decisions,the Board noted that OCAW's call for blanket requests for records had caused110 locals to send identical letters to the employers of their members* * * Such blanket requests pose unnecessary burdens for employers andcannot be justified on the basis of protecting employee safety and health.OSHA should ensure that its rule is not used for the purposes of harassmentby deleting its duplicative union access provision. (Ex. 4-69, pp. 5-6)</ITAG>The evidence indicates that there are occupational health benefits to begained by permitting union access to records (Tr. 157, 201, 328, 341, 347,358, 388, 448, 494, 498, 772, 847, 858, 868, 870, 1037). The ICWU notedin their testimony 25 specific examples where union access to records benefitedworker health (Ex. 15, pp. 5-15). This testimony indicates that the ICWUhas used their records access rights for several valuable occupationalhealth purposes, including formaldehyde hazard recognition and abatement,evaluation of nuisance dust exposure, evaluation of the effects of polychlorinatedbiphenyl (PCB) exposure, evaluation of respiratory protection programs,and evaluation of the effectiveness of eyewash facilities.Union representatives also testified to the impracticality of obtainingindividual employee consent for access to exposure records. Mr. MichaelWright of the United Steelworkers indicated three major problems in obtainingconsent from individual workers:<ITAG tagnum="21">The first is time and red tape. In some cases, for example a primarylead smelter, there may be as many as a thousand workers exposed to a serioustoxic substance_lead, arsenic, something like that * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The second problem is the inevitable conflicts in interpretation thatwould arise * * * where the workers currently exposed in that area arenot the ones on whom the sampling pumps were physically placed * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The third problem * * * is the potential for harassment * * * theOSHA Act itself recognizes the potential for harassment in its own procedures.Workers are allowed to file complaints anonymously * * * Here we have acase where a worker who complains about the potential for a problem inthe area, and where we think we need air sampling results to obtain informationabout that problem, where that potential for harassment exists and is createdby * * * this proposed change in the regulation. (Tr. 861-863)</ITAG>OSHA also notes that the DC Circuit Court found in the lead case (<T3>United Steelworkers </T3>v. <T3>Marshall </T3>647 F. 2d. 1189. DC Circuit 1980. Cert. denied 433 U.S.913, 1981) that requiring specific authorization to give access to recordswhich do not raise significant personal privacy concerns could pose insuperableand unnecessary obstacles to unions, whose access to this information isessential to their role as safety and health advocates for employees.The issue of union access and NLRB jurisdiction was also addressed by theCourt in the Louisiana Chemical Association decision. The Court found thatthe standard's authorization of records access by unions is not an impermissibleinvasion of NLRB jurisdiction because it fulfills the statutory goal ofpromoting healthful working conditions and only incidentally enhances thebargaining status of unions. The Court stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">LCA argues that OSHA has overstepped its jurisdiction, asserting thatthe agency's principal motivation for enacting the rule was to gain a benefitfor employees and unions which they have been unsuccessful in securingthrough the NLRB. Specifically, the benefit of records access. The courtmust make little of such an allegation for two reasons. First, the recordsaccess rule is a duly authorized regulation, reasonably related to itsunderlying statute. While the rule undoubtedly enhances the bargainingstatus of unions, it is plain on the record that this result was simplyincidental to fulfilling the statutory goal of promoting healthful workingconditions. Second, due to the requirement of the NLRA that employers providethe information to unions contemplated in this proceeding, and that factthat the Occupational Safety and Health Act was meant to supplement nationallabor policy, there is no indication that any impropriety has been committedby OSHA. (Ex. 49, p. 17)</ITAG>However, it is also clear that unions have used the access rights grantedby the 1980 regulation to request large amounts of information (Ex. 15,39; Tr. 204, 328). Employers have expressed a great deal of concern overthe potential for harassment through the broad-scale right of access, andremain skeptical with regard to the occupational health benefits derivedfrom providing anyone with access to enormous amounts of data.OSHA has decided that there are merits to both the labor and industry positions.The final rule continues to permit union access to the broad range of exposureinformation covered by the regulation without obtaining the individualauthorization of employees. However, union officials are now required tostate with particularity the records requested to be disclosed, and theirspecific occupational health need for requesting the information. In thismanner, OSHA believes that the occupational health benefits of union accessto records will be achieved while keeping the necessary employer burdensof providing the records to a reasonable minimum.This approach will permit employers to better establish which records areneeded to fulfill the union's stated purpose, and should reduce the burdenson employers of providing access to large amounts of information not germaneto the reason for access.G. Trade Secret ProvisionsThe 1980 regulation required the disclosure of a toxic substance identityeven if the employer considered the identity to be a trade secret. At thesame time, the rule permitted an employer to delete from requested recordsany trade secret information which discloses manufacturing processes, ordiscloses the percentage of a substance in a mixture. If the employer choseto delete such information, he was required to notify the person requestingthe records that such information was deleted on trade secret grounds.If the deletion of information adversely affected the ability to determinethe nature of an employee's exposure, the employer was required to providealternative information sufficient to allow adequate exposure evaluation.The provision requiring toxic substance identity disclosure was troublesometo the flavor and fragrance industries and chemical industries, which maintainedthat the preservation of trade secrets is vital to corporate profitability,and that the regulation's exclusive reliance on confidentiality agreementsto protect trade secrets is inadequate (Ex. 3-44 (FEMA); Ex. 3-35 (CSMA)).The purpose of the regulation is to provide employees with informationon the chemical hazards to which they are potentially exposed. With thisinformation they can better ensure that they are adequately protected againstthese hazards. Any barrier to disclosure between an employer and his employeescan only serve to limit the effectiveness of the rule. However, OSHA thoughtit necessary to modify the regulation so as to strike a better balancebetween providing employees with information necessary to maintain thebenefits established by the regulation and at the same time protect legitimatetrade secrets.As stated in the preamble to the proposal, unqualified trade secret protectioncan act as a significant barrier to the disclosure of exposure information.A trade secret can be anything which a business in fact keeps secret fromits competitors and the public, provided it is minimally novel and commerciallyvaluable. <T3>Restatement of Torts, </T3>andSection; 757 comment (b) (1939); Cavitch,<T3>Business Organizations </T3>andSection; 232.01 (1975). Absolute secrecyis not essential; information can be considered a trade secret even thoughit is divulged to employees or licensees with a ``need to know,'' providedthe holder of the secret had taken steps to restrict unnecessary accessto, and the use of, this privileged knowledge. Cavitch, <T3>supra, </T3>andSection; 232.01(1). Trade secret protection entitles theholder of a trade secret to its commercial exploitation and to certainjudicial remedies for a breach of confidence or dispossession of the tradesecret through improper or unethical means (industrial theft, bribery,spying, etc.). The Supreme Court had identified the maintenance of standardsof commerical ethics and the encouragement of invention as the broadlystated policies behind trade secret law. <T3>Kewanee Oil Co. </T3>v. <T3>Ricron, </T3>416 U.S. 470 (1974). Unlike patents or copyrights, however,there is no comprehensive Federal law of trade secrets, as it is basicallya right created by the States.The conflict between access to exposure and medical records and trade secretinterests arises whenever an employer is asked to reveal information suchas the identity of a chemical which the employer considers to be a tradesecret. While most trade secrets relate to process information or formulaor percentage mixture information, none of which is required to be disclosedby the standard, the identity of a chemical or mixture ingredient may itselfbe considered a trade secret if its existence is unknown to a competitor(e.g. certain intermediates, catalysts) or cannot practically be ``reverseengineered'' by analytical techniques.The same identity information, however, may be essential to the detectionof occupational disease. Since exact chemical identity is the passkey tothe scientific literature, this information must be available to an industrialhygienist or other health professional who is evaluating the hazards associatedwith a chemical. Likewise, it must be available to an epidemiologist whois attempting to link patterns of disease with exposure to a particularchemical and to a treating or consulting physician or health nurse whosuspects that a patient's health problems may be the result of chemicalexposure. While not every employee needs the chemical identity, as distinctfrom hazardous effects and precautionary information, at all times, a primarygoal of the regulation is to encourage employees to seek out advice andinformation about the chemicals in their workplaces. For this to happeneffectively, they need to know the identities of the toxic substances theyare exposed to.In attempting to accommodate the competing interests between chemical identitydisclosure and trade secret protection, OSHA also took into account theexistence of several factors which contribute to the regulatory dilemma.First, a chemical is a trade secret in some contexts but not others, andit may be equally hazardous in either event. Second, whether or not a chemical'sidentity is a trade secret is basically a matter of an employer's self-definition;therefore, permitting non-disclosure of trade secret identity without anyoffsetting obligation could result in over classification of chemicalsas trade secrets.Third, the value of a trade secret, once lost, cannot be fully recaptured,although private remedies for unauthorized disclosures can result in theassessment of monetary damages and injunctive relief. And fourth, OSHApossesses neither the capacity nor expertise to act as a screen of allinformation which an employer is to disclose to employees and claims tobe trade secret.To accommodate these competing interests, OSHA initially proposed (August7, 1981; 46 FR 40492) to strengthen the current trade secret protectionprovisions by permitting liquidated damages clauses in confidentialityagreements entered into by designated representatives. That proposal waslater merged into the current rulemaking. OSHA further proposed other modifications of the trade secret provisionsto make them more protective of trade secrets. In general, these proposedprovisions would have limited the requirements of disclosure to only certaincategories of highly toxic chemicals (e.g., carcinogens) and make the confidentialityagreement authorization a more meaningful protection. More particularly,the proposal included a provision which would permit the employer to withholdprecise chemical identity information of hazardous chemicals which constitutea trade secret, unless the chemical is a carcinogen, mutagen, teratogen,or a cause of significant irreversible damage to human organs or body systemsand there is a need to know the precise chemical name. Where trade secretidentities were withheld, the proposal required the employer to: (1) Be capable of substantiating that it is a trade secret; (2) Identify the chemical by a generic chemical classification;(3) Provide all other information on the properties and effects of thechemical; and (4) In any event, release on a confidential basis the chemical identityto a treating or consulting physician who has stated in writing (exceptin an emergency) that a patient's health problems may be the result ofoccupational exposure. Since the employee's personal or treating physicianmay not be familiar with the toxic effects of workplace chemicals, theCAC recommended that trade secrets also be mandatorily disclosed to consultingphysicians assisting in the treatment of disorders of suspect occupationalcausation. OSHA adopted this recommendation. The 1980 rule permitted the employer to condition access to trade secretinformation by employees or their designated representatives upon the signingof a confidentiality agreement. The proposal strengthened the agreementprovision by allowing that the agreement restrict use of the informationto health purposes, prohibit redisclosure of the information to consultingphysician, and provide for compensation or other legally appropriate relieffor competitive harm which may result from a breach of the agreement. Theterms of such an agreement would be worked out between the employer andthe requesting party and be governed by the applicable state law. OSHAintended to be neutral on the kinds of damages provisions that may be included.At the hearings, Dr. Leonard Vance stated that the trade secret issue wouldbe decided on evidence in the combined records of the hazard communicationand records access rulemakings (Tr. 25). A thorough analysis of evidenceconcerning the trade secret issue in these combined records is found inthe preamble to the Hazard Communication standard (48 FR 53280). OSHA concluded from this analysis that in certain instances trade secretdisclosure is warranted to protect the safety and health of employees.However, OSHA also recognizes that specific chemical identity informationcan constitute a <T3>bona fide </T3>trade secret, and thus has included in the final regulationprovisions to protect such an identity while providing for the proper protectionof exposed employees. This is accomplished by providing for limited tradesecret disclosure to health professionals, employees and designated representativesunder prescribed conditions of need and confidentiality. The term ``specific chemical identity'' is used to describe the trade secretinformation being discussed. The term refers to the chemical name, theChemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number, or any other specificinformation which reveals the precise chemical designation. It does notinclude common names. The proposed rule did not include a definition for the term ``trade secret'',although OSHA has stated that it considers the definition derived fromthe Restatement of Torts to be the appropriate one. In response to commentssuggesting that the definition be explicitly stated in the final rule,OSHA has added a definition to clarify what the Agency considers to bea trade secret for purposes of this regulation. This definition is thesame as that included in the Hazard Communication standard. Given that it is recognized that the chemical identification of a chemicalmay be a trade secret, the rule establishes an information disclosure schemewhich requires the release of essential hazard information, and definesthe terms under which the chemical identity must also be released. In general, the regulation requires the disclosure of specific chemicalidentities, but permits the employer to withhold this information fromdisclosable records if certain conditions can be met: (1) The employercan support the claim that it is a trade secret; (2) all other informationconcerning the toxic substance is disclosed as required; (3) the employerindicates that the specific chemical identity is being withheld as a tradesecret; and (4) the chemical name is made available to health professionals,employees and designated representatives under certain specified situations.In the case of a medical emergency, the employer must immediately disclosethe identity of a toxic substance to a treating physician or nurse whenit is needed for proper emergency or first aid treatment. As soon as circumstancespermit, however, the employer may obtain a written statement of need anda confidentiality agreement as provided for above. In non-emergency situations, employers are required to disclose the withheldspecific chemical identity to employees and designated representatives,and to health professionals providing medical or other occupational healthservices to exposed employees if certain conditions are met. A request for trade secret information must be in writing, and must describewith reasonable detail the medical or occupational health need for theinformation. To be considered a medical or occupational health need forpurposes of this regulation, the health professional must be planning touse the specific chemical identity information for one or more of the followingactivities.1. To assess the hazards of the chemicals to which the employees will beexposed.2. To conduct or assess sampling of the workplace atmosphere to determineemployee exposure levels. 3. To assess or conduct pre-assignment or periodic medical surveillanceof exposed employees. 4. To provide medical treatment to exposed employees. 5. To select appropriate personal protective equipment for exposed employees.6. To assess engineering controls or other protective measures for exposedemployees. 7. To conduct studies to determine the health effects of exposure. It should be noted that for purposes of this regulation, exposure includespotential, as well as current, exposure situations. Thus the health professional,employee or designated representative will be able to obtain the necessaryinformation prior to actual exposure, and preventive measures, if appropriate,can be implemented to avoid the occurrence of adverse health effects.In addition, the written request must also explain in detail why the disclosureof the specific chemical identity is essential to providing the occupationalhealth services, and why disclosure of the following types of informationwould not satisfy the requesting parties need:1. Properties and effects of the chemical.2. Measures for controlling workers' exposure to the chemical.3. Methods of monitoring and analyzing worker exposure to the chemical.4. Methods of diagnosing and treating harmful exposures to the chemical.OSHA anticipates that in many situation the alternative information willbe sufficient to satisfy the health professional's needs.The request for the information must further provide a description of theprocedures to be used to protect the confidentiality of the information.An agreement not to use the information for any purpose other than thehealth need asserted or to release it under any circumstances other thanto OSHA must also be included, and signed by the requesting party as wellas the employer or contractor of the health professional or designatedrepresentative. The requirement that the employer or contractor of thehealth professional or designated representative be a co-signatory to theagreement applies equally regardless of whether the health professionalor designated representative is providing occupational health or medicalservices to a labor organization, or individual employees, and regardlessof whether the health professional or designated representative is beingpaid for his services. This makes explicit that both the principal andthe agent are legally responsible for compliance with the agreement, althoughonly the health professional or designated representative may actuallyhave access to the specific chemicial identity information.The provisions of the confidentiality agreement may not include requiringthe posting of a penalty bond. It may restrict use of the information tothe purposes indicated in the statement of need, prohibit disclosure toanyone other than OSHA who have not signed an agreement, and provide forappropriate legal remedies, including stipulation of a reasonable pre-estimateof likely damages. Nothing in the regulation is meant to preclude the partiesfrom pursuing non-contractual remedies to the extent permitted by law.If the health professional, employee or designated representative decidesthere is a need to disclose the information to OSHA, the employer who providedthe information must be informed by the requesting party prior to or atthe same time as such disclosure.If the employer denies the written request for information, the denialmust also be in writing, and be provided within thirty days of the request.The denial must provide evidence to support the claim that the chemicalidentity is a trade secret, state the specific reasons why the requestis being denied, and explain in detail how alternative information maysatisfy the occupational health need without revealing the chemical identity.The requesting health professional, employee or designated representativewho still needs the information may then refer the matter to OSHA for consideration.The original request, as well as the written denial, must be provided toOSHA at the time of this referral. OSHA will review these documents todetermine whether the employer has supported the claim that the chemicalidentity is a trade secret, and that the health professional has demonstrateda medical or occupational health need for the information, as well as adequatemeans to protect the confidentiality of the information.If OSHA determines that the chemical identity is not a trade secret, itis not protected by the regulation and the employer will be subject tocitation. Similarly, the employer will be subject to citation if the specificchemical identity is a trade secret, but the requesting party has demonstrateda medical or occupational health need, executed a confidentiality agreement,and has shown adequate means for complying with the terms of the confidentialityagreement. Abatement of the citation will most likely be to divulge thespecific chemical identity subject to the confidentiality agreement. However,consistent with the power given to the Secretary in section 15 of the Act,if the employer demonstrates to OSHA that the execution of a confidentialityagreement would not provide sufficient protection against the potentialharm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret chemical identity,the Assistant Secretary may issue such orders or impose such additionallimitations or conditions upon disclosure as may be appropriate to assurethat the occupational health services are provided without an undue riskof harm to the employer. It is contemplated that the Assistant Secretarywould personally review and approve such orders, limitations or conditions.The employer is required to divulge to the Assistant Secretary or designeeany information required under this regulation. However, the employer mayclaim trade secret status at the time the information is provided, andthe Assistant Secretary will make the necessary arrangements to ensureprotection of such trade secrets, in accordance with the provisions ofsection 15 of the Act.The amended trade secrets provisions of this regulation are identical tothose for the Hazard Communication standard. OSHA believes that this isan important benefit of the amended provisions since the purposes and policiesof both regulations, disclosure of chemical identities, knowledge of hazardsand means for health protection, and trade secret provisions are similar.In addition, it is administratively convenient both to the public and OSHAfor the provisions to be similar. There are two differences between OSHA'sHazard Communication standard and this rule with regard to trade secretdisclosure. First, the Hazard Communication standard presently appliesonly to chemical manufacturers, distributers and importers, and to allemployers in SIC Codes 20 through 39 (Division D, Standard Industrial ClassificationManual). The records access rule, on the other hand, applies broadly toall employers in general industry, construction and maritime.Second, the Hazard Communication standard comtemplates disclosure to healthprofessionals who may represent employers and employees other than thoseof the trade secret holder (i.e., ``downstream'' disclosure). The RecordsAccess rule does not provide ``downstream'' employees or designated representativesaccess rights to trade secret information.The decision to retain for employee and designated representative as wellas health professional access to trade secret chemical identities in thefinal Records Access rule in further supported by the recent <T3>Supreme Court</T3> decision, <T3>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association </T3>v. <T3>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance </T3>Co., et al. The Court heldthat whenever a federal agency contemplates revoking or modifying an existingrule, it shoulders the same burden to justify its decision to revoke ormodify the standard as if it were issuing it in the first place.As noted above, the 1980 regulation provided for unrestricted employeeand designated representative access to trade secret chemical identitiesconditioned solely upon signing a confidentiality agreement. Insufficientevidence was presented indicating the employee and designated representativeaccess was unfairly jeopardizing employees trades secrets. Therefore, theevidence does not justify restricting access to trade secrets to physiciansor health professionals as contemplated by the proposal and advocated byseveral commenters.However, OSHA had decided that <T3>bona fide </T3>trade secrets do deserve greater protection than providedin the 1980 regulation, and has therefore established the more stringentaccess procedures noted above.H. X-ray MicrofilmingParagraph (d)(2) of the 1980 regulation stated that ``nothing in this sectionis intended to mandate the form, manner, or process by which an employerpreserves a record so long as the information contained in the record ispreserved and retrievable, except that X-ray films shall be preserved intheir original state.'' The X-ray preservation requirement resulted froma finding by OSHA at that time that the diagnostic detail of certain X-rayscould be lost when the original X-ray is microfilmed. X-rays related toa possible diagnosis of pneumoconiosis are particularly susceptible tothis loss of detail. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dust in thelungs and the tissue reaction to its presence. Inhalation of the dustsof coal, aluminum, beryllium, asbestos, aluminum oxide, silica, hematite(iron oxide), talc, kaolin, mica and cement are commonly associated withthe development of pneumoconiosis. The earliest diagnostic indicationsof pneumoconiosis are often barely perceptible changes in the chest X-ray.Following promulgation of the 1980 rule, OSHA received comments from anumber of interested parties concerning the requirement that X-rays bekept in their original state (Exs. 3-3, 3-5, 3-8, 3-10, 3-15). They arguedin general that modern microfilm processes can reduce X-rays for storagewithout an appreciable loss of diagnostic detail. Also, they maintainedthat microfilm storage is preferable for long-term X-ray preservation dueto the fact that microfilm processes use archival materials which are speciallyresistant to fading and decay. By contrast, original X-rays can fade andcrack over time to the possible detriment of their diagnostic value.In response, OSHA proposed allowing the microfilm storage of X-rays ifperformed under the supervision of a licensed radiologist who is a diplomateof the American Board of Radiology. In addition, for the microfilm storageof a chest X-ray where the subject worker has been exposed to a substanceknown to cause pneumoconiosis, the proposal required that the supervisingradiologist consult with and obtain the written approval of the microfilmprocess from both: (a) A licensed physician who is a diplomate of the AmericanBoard of Internal Medicine certified in the subspecialty of pulmonary disease,and (b) a ``B'' reader certified by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH). OSHA stated in the proposal its belief thatthe microfilming of chest X-rays of workers exposed to toxic substancesknown to cause pneumoconiosis deserves separate consideration. In thiscase extremely fine shadings of image density are often required for properanalysis and diagnosis. Therefore there is an increased risk that diagnosticdetail could be lost if current standard microfilm processes are used.At the public hearing, Dr. William S. Cole, M.D., appeared on behalf ofthe Task Force on Pneumoconiosis of the American College of Radiology.He testified that the Task Force recommends that OSHA not permit the microfilmingor other minification of chest X-rays, but could allow the minificationof other X-rays provided that any original and subsequent interpretationsof the X-rays are also microfilmed. Dr. Cole testified that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Task Force advanced three compelling reasons against optical minificationtechniques.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. A loss of image detail inherent in any copying method;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. An absence of medically accepted standards for minification quality;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The presence of unavoidable variables introduced into viewing bydependence upon projectors and screens. (Tr. 254)</ITAG>Dr. Cole sumarized the Task Force recommendations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Require that chest radiographs be retained in their original formalong with copies of original and subsequent interpretations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Allow the copying of other radiologic images, subject to this firstregulation, by any optical or electronic copying method acceptable to theinstitution or organization retaining custody, but only under the supervisionof a radiologist to ensure that integrity of the image;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Expand the definition of a radiologist to include a physician appropriatelycredentialed by the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Require that the written interpretive reports accompanying theimpages also be copied and retaining. (Tr. 256)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NIOSH and the American Lung Association also took the position thatthe microfilming of chest X-rays should not be permitted (Ex. 4-48; Tr.108).Several commenters opposed the Task Force recommendations (Ex. 4-4, 4-6,4-60). In opposing the ban on microfilming X-rays, Mr. Stephen Fisher (RadiologicalSystems Microfilm Association) stated in his post-hearing comments that:<ITAG tagnum="21">If in fact OSHA adopts a ruling which disallows the microfilming ofchest x-rays * * * OSHA will have done a great disservice to the peoplethat they are trying to protect_the potentially exposed industrial worker.His radiographs will then be left to deteriorate beyond the point of anymedical value. (Ex. 53, p. 1)</ITAG>However, when questioned about the potential degradation of X-rays, Dr.Cole stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The old acetate emulsions that were used years ago did degrade. Butthe ones that are being made available today, I haven't seen it and I haveseen films that are 20, 25 years old and I have not seen any degradationof the image, no. (Tr. 262)</ITAG>Based primarily on the testimony of Dr. Cole and the American College ofRadiology, OSHA has decided to permit the microfilming of all X-rays exceptfor chest X-rays, which must continue to be retained in their originalform. However, all permitted X-ray microfilming must be performed in accordancewith generally accepted medical practice.I. Duty to Inform EmployeesThe 1980 regulation required in paragraph (g)(1) that ``upon an employee'sfirst entering into employment, and at least annually thereafter, eachemployer shall inform employees exposed to toxic substances or harmfulphysical agents of (the regulation).'' ``Employees'' was defined underparagraph (c)(4) as including former employees. Therefore the regulationwas susceptible to the interpretation that employers were required to informformer employees of the provisions of the regulation (see Ex. 3-62). Thiswas not OSHA's original intent. To clarify OSHA's intent, the proposalinserted the word ``current'' into paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) to indicatethat the employer's notification responsibility extends only to employeescurrently employed. No comments in opposition to this proposed modificationwere received and it has been adopted for the final rule.<T3>J. Federal Employees</T3>This regulation applies to Federal agencies under Executive Order 12196.However, the retention of records of Federal employees is regulated bythe National Archives and Records Service, General Services Administration(GSA) under 44 U.S.C. 3303a (Ex. 57), which supersedes the OSHA accessstandard. GSA Bulletin FPMR B-117 (Ex. 57, Att. 1) contains guidelinesdesigned to ensure agency compliance with the records disposition provisionsof the Federal Records Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Assessment and Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG><T3>A. Introduction</T3>Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197, February 19, 1981) provides for thedevelopment of a ``regulatory analysis'' when a regulation has major economicconsequences for the general economy, individual industries, geographicalregions or levels of government. E.O. 12291 replaced Executive Order 12044,which also had provided for regulatory analyses of major standards.OSHA issued the original access to exposure and medical records rule onMay 23, 1980 (45 FR 35212-35303). At that time, OSHA concluded that thisregulation would impose compliance costs below the Executive Order 12044threshold of $100 million in annual costs for the economy. This assessmentwas based on the determination that the rule would not require the creationof new records or reports, nor would it impose any additional environmentalor employee monitoring or medical surveillance requirements. Finally, therule was performance-oriented, in that the content of exposure and medicalrecords was left to the employer. As a result, OSHA determined that a formalregulatory analysis under E.O. 12044 was unnecessary.On July 13, 1982, OSHA issued the proposed modifications to the accessto employee exposure and medical records regulation (47 FR 30420-30438).At that time OSHA concluded that the proposed revisions would further lowercompliance costs while causing no significant impact on competition, productivity,domestic investment, employment, innovation, or foreign competition_thecriteria required to be considered under the current Executive Order. Forthese reasons, the proposed regulation was not considered major under thenew E.O. 12291.The final regulation will also impose less than $100 million in annualcosts to the economy. This is because the final rule leaves intact mostof the provisions of the current rule. The sections of the final regulationthat differ from the current regulation (e.g., allowing the minificationof X-rays other than chest X-rays, providing greater trade secret protection,and excluding first aid records, and elimination of record retention forshort-term employees) will reduce the costs of the current rule with nodiminution of the rule's benefits.The final regulation will also not have a disproportionate economic impacton small entities. Likewise, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub.L. 96-353, 94 Stat. 1164 (5. U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>)) requires that OSHA give special consideration to theeconomic impact of the proposed rule on small entities. Such considerationshould include a description of regulatory alternatives and estimates ofthe impacts of reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirementsin order to minimize any significant impact of the proposed regulationon small entities.B. Summary of CostsSeveral provisions of the modified rule will significantly reduce compliancecosts of the regulation when compared to the 1980 rule. Major cost-savingmodifications include: (1) Exempting medical records of short-term employeesfrom the regulation's long-term retention requirements; (2) exempting mostfirst aid records from the regulation's retention requirements; (3) modifyingthe broad-based rights of designated representatives to gain unconsentedaccess to employee exposure records; and (4) modifying the absolute prohibitionon the microfilm storage of employee X-rays.Exempting the medical records of short-term employees from the long-termpreservation requirements of the regulation should result in significantsavings. Based on employment levels in the affected industries and on theNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) NationalOccupational Health Survey OSHA has estimated that about 10.1 million medicalrecords would be generated annually. Of those 10.1 million medical records,approximately 20 percent (2 million) medical records per year would beexempted from the requirement to retain medical records for the durationof employment plus thirty years. These records would be given to the employee,enabling the construction of a work life medical history for that employee.Records of first aid treatment for minor scratches, cuts, burns, splinters,etc. have also been exempted from the regulation's retention requirements.OSHA has not estimated the volume of records covered by this exemption.Testimony of construction industry employers indicates that savings wouldbe significant since the majority of medical records generated in thisindustry are first aid records.The modified rule also requires designated representatives seeking unconsentedaccess to employee exposure records to state with reasonable particularitythe records requested, the specific occupational health need for theserecords. This provision would permit employers to respond to a requestwith only those records needed. This provision therefore provides a specificalternative to blanket requests for records far in excess of what is neededto satisfy a particular occupational health concern.Finally, the regulation permits the microfilm storage of all employee X-raysexcept chest X-rays. This provision reduces compliance costs by allowingless expensive storage of X-rays other than chest X-rays.OSHA estimated in 1980 that the costs of the records access regulationwould not exceed $100 million annually. This estimate was little contestedin the rulemaking record. OSHA's review of the cost-saving provisions ofthe modified rule supports the conclusion that compliance costs with themodified rule will also be less than $100 million annually. No modificationshave been made to the rule which would increase compliance costs.C. Summary of BenefitsEmployee medical and exposure records are potentially important to thedetection, treatment, and prevention of occupational disease. If workersand their representatives are to play a meaningful role in their own healthmanagement they must have an opportunity to review their medical and exposurerecords. Access will enable workers and their personal physicians to uncoverpatterns of health impairment and disease. Access to exposure and medicalrecords and long-term preservation of these records may also facilitateformal occupational health research on substances for which little scientifichealth data presently exist.The trade secret modifications allow employers adequate trade secret protectionswhile providing requesting parties access to the necessary informationwithout the requirement for bonding and liquidated damages. Also, the finalrule will provide employee protection equivalent to that provided in the1980 standard while lowering costs to employers.D. Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisThe impact of the 1980 access rule on small businesses was determined tobe insignificant. According to the 1972 NOH survey, only 1.4 percent ofall small firms (8-250 employees) regularly monitored workplace environmentalconditions. Only 2.3 percent of these firms had a formally establishedhealth unit. Approximately one-half of all small firms collected some preemploymenthealth information on new employees, but less than 10 percent providedperiodic medical exams to workers. The U.S. Department of Commerce CountyBusiness Patterns 1977 (Ex. 81) estimates that more than 68 percent ofall employees work in firms of less than 250 employees.To summarize the results of the NOH survey as it pertains to small entities.(1) Most small firms do not collect health information beyond that on newemployees.(2) Few small firms provide formal or periodic health care, and(3) Few small firms regularly monitor workplace environmental conditions.Although these percentages cited above have probably increased in the lastdecade, the vast majority of small entities will not be affected by theregulation because medical surveillance and environmental monitoring arenot required. The regulation does require that firms creating medical andexposure records must keep them and grant employee access to them. Sincefew small entities create or store such records, the economic impact ofthe regulation on these firms is small.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 1910</ITAG>Occupational safety and health, Health, Health records.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

AppendixA to this section contains a sample form which may be used to establishspecific written consent for access to employee medical records.  (C) Whenever access to employee medical records is requested, a physicianrepresenting the employer may recommend that the employee or designatedrepresentative:  (<T3>1</T3>) Consult with the physician for the purposes of reviewing anddiscussing the records requested,  (<T3>2</T3>) Accept a summary of material facts and opinions in lieu ofthe records requested, or  (<T3>3</T3>) Accept release of the requested records only to a physicianor other designated representative.  (D) Whenever an employee requests access to his or her employee medicalrecords, and a physician representing the employer believes that directemployee access to information contained in the records regarding a specificdiagnosis of a terminal illness or a psychiatric condition could be detrimentalto the employee's health, the employer may inform the employee that accesswill only be provided to a designated representative of the employee havingspecific written consent, and deny the employee's request for direct accessto this information only. Where a designated representative with specificwritten consent requests access to information so withheld, the employershall assure the access of the designated representative to this information,even when it is known that the designated representative will give theinformation to the employee. (E) A physician, nurse, or other responsible health care personnel maintainingmedical records may delete from requested medical records the identityof a family member, personal friend, or fellow employee who has providedconfidential information concerning an employee's health status.

Whenever deletion of trade secret information substantiallyimpairs evaluation of the place where or the time when exposure to a toxicsubstance or harmful physical agent occurred, the employer shall providealternative information which is sufficient to permit the requesting partyto identify where and when exposure occurred. (2) The employer may withhold the specific chemical identity, includingthe chemical name and other specific identification of a toxic substancefrom a disclosable record provided that: (i) The claim that the information withheld is a trade secret can be supported; (ii) All other available information on the properties and effects of thetoxic substance is disclosed;(iii) The employer informs the requesting party that the specific chemicalidentity is being withheld as a trade secret; and (iv) The specific chemical identity is made available to health professionals,employees and designated representatives in accordance with the specificapplicable provisions of this paragraph.(3) Where a treating physician or nurse determines that a medical emergencyexists and the specific chemical identity of a toxic substance is necessaryfor emergency or first-aid treatment, the employer shall immediately disclosethe specific chemical identity of a trade secret chemical to the treatingphysician or nurse, regardless of the existence of a written statementof need or a confidentiality agreement. The employer may require a writtenstatement of need and confidentiality agreement, in accordance with theprovisions of paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), as soon as circumstances permit.(4) In non-emergency situations, an employer shall, upon request, disclosea specific chemical identity, otherwise permitted to be withheld underparagraph (f)(2) of this section, to a health professional, employee, ordesignated representative if:(i) The request is in writing;(ii) The request describes with reasonable detail one or more of the followingoccupational health needs for the information:(A) To assess the hazards of the chemicals to which employees will be exposed;(B) To conduct or assess sampling of the workplace atmosphere to determineemployee exposure levels;(C) To conduct pre-assignment or periodic medical surveillance of exposedemployees;(D) To provide medical treatment to exposed employees;(E) To select or assess appropriate personal protective equipment for exposedemployees;(F) To design or assess engineering controls or other protective measuresfor exposed employees; and (G) To conduct studies to determine the health effects of exposure.(iii) The request explains in detail why the disclosure of the specificchemical identity is essential and that, in lieu thereof, the disclosureof the following information would not enable the health professional,employee or designated representative to provide the occupational healthservices described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section:(A) The properties and effects of the chemical;(B) Measures for controlling workers' exposure to the chemical;(C) Methods of monitoring and analyzing worker exposure to the chemical;and,(D) Methods of diagnosing and treating harmful exposures to the chemical;(iv) The request includes a description of the procedures to be used tomaintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information; and,(v) The health professional, employee, or designated representative andthe employer or contractor of the services of the health professional ordesignated representative agree in a written confidentiality agreementthat the health professional, employee or designated representative willnot use the trade secret information for any purpose other than the healthneed(s) asserted and agree not to release the information under any circumstancesother than to OSHA, as provided in paragraph (f)(9) of this section, exceptas authorized by the terms of the agreement or by the employer.(5) The confidentiality agreement authorized by paragraph (f)(4)(iv) ofthis section:(i) May restrict the use of the information to the health purposes indicatedin the written statement of need;(ii) May provide for appropriate legal remedies in the event of a breachof the agreement, including stipulation of a reasonable pre-estimate oflikely damages; and,(iii) May not include requirements for the posting of a penalty bond.(6) Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the parties from pursuingnon-contractual remedies to the extent permitted by law.(7) If the health professional, employee or designated representative receivingthe trade secret information decides that there is a need to disclose itto OSHA, the employer who provided the information shall be informed bythe health professional prior to, or at the same time as, such disclosure.(8) If the employer denies a written request for disclosure of a specificchemical identity, the denial must:(i) Be provided to the health professional, employee or designated representativewithin thirty days of the request;(ii) Be in writing;(iii) Include evidence to support the claim that the specific chemicalidentity is a trade secret;(iv) State the specific reasons why the request is being denied; and,(v) Explain in detail how alternative information may satisfy the specificmedical or occupational health need without revealing the specific chemicalidentity.(9) The health professional, employee, or designated representative whoserequest for information is denied under paragraph (f)(4) of this sectionmay refer the request and the written denial of the request to OSHA forconsideration.(10) When a heath professional employee, or designated representative refersa denial to OSHA under paragraph (f)(9) of this section, OSHA shall considerthe evidence to determine if:(i) The employer has supported the claim that the specific chemical identityis a trade secret;(ii) The health professional employee, or designated representative hassupported the claim that there is a medical or occupational health needfor the information; and(iii) The health professional, employee or designated representative hasdemonstrated adequate means to protect the confidentiality.(11)(i) If OSHA determines that the specific chemical identity requestedunder paragraph (f)(4) of this section is not a <T3>bona fide </T3>trade secret, or that it is a trade secret but the requestinghealth professional, employee or designated representatives has a legitimatemedical or occupational health need for the information, has executed awritten confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means for complyingwith the terms of such agreement, the employer will be subject to citationby OSHA.(ii) If an employer demonstrates to OSHA that the execution of a confidentialityagreement would not provide sufficient protection against the potentialharm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret specific chemicalidentity, the Assistant Secretary may issue such orders or impose suchadditional limitations or conditions upon the disclosure of the requestedchemical information as may be appropriate to assure that the occupationalhealth needs are met without an undue risk of harm to the employer.(12) Notwithstanding the existence of a trade secret claim, an employershall, upon request, disclose to the Assistant Secretary any informationwhich this section requires the employer to make available. Where thereis a trade secret claim, such claim shall be made no later than at thetime the information is provided to the Assistant Secretary so that suitabledeterminations of trade secret status can be made and the necessary protectionscan be implemented.(13) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the disclosureunder any circumstances of process or percentage of mixture informationwhich is trade secret.(g) <T3>Employee information. </T3>(1) Upon an employee's first entering intoemployment, and at least annually thereafter, each employer shall informcurrent employees covered by this section of the following:(i) The existence, location, and availability of any records covered bythis section;(ii) The person responsible for maintaining and providing access to records;and(iii) Each employee's rights of access to these records.(2) Each employer shall keep a copy of this section and its appendices,and make copies readily available, upon request, to employees. The employershall also distribute to current employees any informational materialsconcerning this section which are made available to the employer by theAssistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.(h) <T3>Transfer of records. </T3>(1) Whenever an employer is ceasing to dobusiness, the employer shall transfer all records subject to this sectionto the successor employer. The successor employer shall receive and maintainthese records.(2) Whenever an employer is ceasing to do business and there is no successoremployer to receive and maintain the records subject to this standard,the employer shall notify affected current employees of their rights ofaccess to records at least three (3) months prior to the cessation of theemployer's business.(3) Whenever an employer either is ceasing to do business and there isno successor employer to receive and maintain the records, or intends todispose of any records required to be preserved for at least thirty (30)years, the employer shall:(i) Transfer the records to the Director of the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) if so required by a specific occupationalsafety and health standard; or(ii) Notify the Director of NIOSH in writing of the impending disposalof records at least three (3) months prior to the disposal of the records.(4) Where an employer regularly disposes of records required to be preservedfor at least thirty (30) years, the employer may, with at least (3) monthsnotice, notify the Director of NIOSH on an annual basis of the recordsintended to be disposed of in the coming year.(i) <T3>Appendices. </T3>The information contained in appendices A and B tothis section is not intended, by itself, to create any additional obligationsnot otherwise imposed by this section nor detract from any existing obligation.<ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix A to </ITAG><T2>andSection; </T2>1910.20_Sample Authorization Letter for the Releaseof Employee Medical Record Information to a Designated Representative (Non-Mandatory)<ITAG tagnum="21">I, _____ (full name of worker/patient), hereby authorize ______ (individualor organization holding the medical records) to release to ______ (individualor organization authorized to receive the medical information), the followingmedical information from my personal medical records:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Describe generally the information desired to be released)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I give my permission for this medical information to be used for thefollowing purpose:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">but I do not give permission for any other use or re-disclosure ofthis information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T4>Note: </T4>Several extra lines are provided below so that you can placeadditional restrictions on this authorization letter if you want to.

Thevarious types of toxic effects linked to literature citations provide researchersand occupational health scientists with an introduction to the toxicologicalliterature, making their own review of the toxic hazards of a given substanceeasier. By presenting data on the lowest reported doses that produce effectsby several routes of entry in various species, the Registry furnishes valuableinformation to those responsible for preparing safety data sheets for chemicalsubstances in the workplace. Chemical and production engineers can usethe Registry to identify the hazards which may be associated with chemicalintermediates in the development of final products, and thus can more readilyselect substitutes or alternative processes which may be less hazardous.Some organizations, including health agencies and chemical companies, haveincluded the NIOSH Registry accession numbers with the listing of chemicalsin their files to reference toxicity information associated with thosechemicals.
