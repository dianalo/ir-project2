<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-1125 </DOCNO><TEXT>The spectrum of fermions in the presence of the W-boson-condensed electro-weakliquid is obtained and nonvanishing spatial component of the fermionicpolarization operator is calculated for zero 4-momentum. The manifestationof the Meissner effect is studied. The London penetration depth{lambda}/subL/ is calculated in the limit of small W-condensate amplitude. The possibilityof a special phenomenon of partial magnetic screening due to the mixingangle dependence on the leptonic density is discussed in connection withthe magnetic mass problem.</TEXT></DOC>
