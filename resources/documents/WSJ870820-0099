Analysts and investors said they expect that Citicorp's move could lead other big U.S. banks to raise new equity to strengthen capital in the wake of their recent huge additions to loan-loss reserves. But because new equity issues would dilute the shares outstanding, investors reacted negatively.    Some analysts also said that banks might try to strengthen capital through asset sales and higher earnings rather than by issuing new equity.    Big U.S. bank holding companies, including Chase Manhattan Corp. and Chemical New York Corp., generally denied any immediate plans to issue new equity, although some said they were studying the matter.    Citicorp's stock slid $2.50 to close at $63.125. Other big bank stocks fell somewhat less, with Chemical down $1.25 to $42.75, Manufacturers Hanover down 87.5 cents to $44.625 and Chase down 37.5 cents to $42.875. BankAmerica Corp. closed at $12.875, down 12.5 cents. All closing prices were in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    &quot;My surprise is that the other big U.S. banks didn't try to beat Citicorp to it; they allowed Citicorp to be first twice,&quot; said Hal Schwind, an analyst at IDS Financial Corp., a Minneapolis-based fund manager. Citicorp also led U.S. banks into their recent $15 billion of loss provisions against loans to developing countries, with its May 19 decision to add $3 billion to loan-loss reserves.    Mr. Schwind, who said his firm holds 300,000 Citicorp shares, asked: &quot;Is this the first and last stage? It wouldn't surprise me if (Citicorp) did another $1 billion in two years' time.&quot; But Don Howard, Citicorp's chief financial officer, said &quot;we think this is going to do it for quite a while.&quot;    Analysts believe other big U.S. banks will have to raise capital in the wake of Citicorp's move, which would represent the biggest bank stock issue in history. &quot;The big U.S. banks are short of capital and will have to raise it. That is Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical and Chase,&quot; said Robin Monro-Davies, managing director of IBCA Ltd., a London-based international banking consultant. &quot;They'll be following on in some way. They've got to do it,&quot; he added, noting that Manufacturers Hanover's common equity has recently dipped as low as 2.3% of total assets. Regulators encourage banks to maintain equity of about 3.5% to 4% of total assets.    The market's &quot;operating assumption&quot; is that other big banks also will soon issue new equity, said James McDermott, executive vice president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a securities firm specializing in bank stocks. He added: &quot;It's just a question of when they make the decision. What concerns the market is that there could be $2 billion or $3 billion of equity coming behind&quot; the Citicorp issue.    But many big U.S. banks denied any immediate plans. &quot;We have no current plans to raise common equity,&quot; a Chemical spokesman said, although he conceded that his bank's common equity expressed as a percentage of assets is at a historic low. A Chase spokesman said, &quot;We have no immediate plans to issue new stock.&quot; An official at another major bank indicated that his company intended to build capital through asset sales and higher earnings before issuing new equity.    A Manufacturers Hanover spokesman said his company &quot;is studying all options (for raising capital), which include direct access to capital markets, the sale of undervalued assets and the realizing of substantial tax benefits.&quot;    BankAmerica has recently been trying to raise new capital in Japan. Sources at that bank said this week that at least six Japanese institutions had agreed to provide BankAmerica between $120 million and $150 million through subordinated debt.    J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp., the two money-center banks that have maintained the strongest equity-to-assets ratios, face little pressure to issue stock. A Bankers Trust spokesman said the question is &quot;under review.&quot; A Morgan spokesman said he wouldn't comment on either Citicorp's plans or Morgan's.    Some analysts were cautionary about how much new equity in big banks the market could absorb. Felice Gelman of Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc., said, &quot;I'm sure everyone would like to emulate Citicorp, but it's not clear that this is what will happen. To raise their equity levels to 4% of assets as Citicorp contemplates, Manufacturers Hanover would need to issue $1 billion in shares, Chemical would need $800 million and Chase $350 million. Those are real big numbers.&quot;    But analysts expect the Citicorp issue will be sold. &quot;I assume they'll get it off. I think they'll sell it where they can. But it'll be an effort,&quot; said Mr. Monro-Davies, who mentioned that the London markets now are having to absorb substantial amounts of big-bank stock. &quot;You've got Midland (Midland Bank PLC) raising about #700 million ($1.13 billion), and the possibility that other London-based banks also may raise money through the equity market,&quot; he said. As much as 3.5 million of the 17 million new Citicorp shares may be offered in London, an investment banker close to the issue indicated.    Those who rate bank stocks were pleased by Citicorp's announcement. &quot;It's a positive event for the company's creditworthiness,&quot; said Robert Grossman, a vice president at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
