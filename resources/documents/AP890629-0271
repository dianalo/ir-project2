BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Banc One Corp., an Ohio banking company known forits consumer innovations, overcame six other bids to win the 20failed banks of Dallas-based MCorp in what is estimated to becomethe nation's third-largest bank bailout, regulators said today.   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., told reporters in Washington, D.C., the best estimate ofgovernment assistance required for MCorp is $2 billion, with therisk that the cost could ultimately be 10 percent to 15 percenthigher.   He said the MCorp rescue likely will prove to be the secondbiggest in the history of the FDIC, which insures commercial bankdeposits.   The initial government payouts were larger for both the 1988rescue of First RepublicBank of Dallas and the 1984 deal involvingContinental Illinois of Chicago. However, Seidman said the ultimatecost of First RepublicBank will likely be $3 billion _ moreexpensive than MCorp _ while the eventual pricetag of theContinental Illinois rescue will be a less-costly $1.5 billion.   The FDIC, which insures the nation's bank deposits, announcedBanc One's selection Wednesday, but withheld details of thegovernment assistance package until today.   Analysts praised the decision, saying it would add a strongcompetitor to Texas' troubled banking industry. Bidders who lost outsaid they are prepared to compete.   Seidman said in a statement Wednesday that Banc One was selectedin ``a highly competitive process'' from among ``attractiveproposals.''   Banc One said it would begin managing the banks July 5 under thename Bank One Texas, and would purchase the banks after a four- tosix-month period during which problem assets would be identified.   The holding company said it would invest about $500 million tobuy all of Bank One Texas' equity.   Bill Boardman, a Banc One senior vice president, said the FDICwould take over problem loans and ``bring the balance sheet to azero position.''   ``We won't know how many dollars are involved until the closingof the transaction,'' Boardman said. Banc One has its own estimateof the cost, but Boardman declined to say what the estimate was.   Analysts predicted it could take as much as $2 billion to bailout the banks, ranking only behind 1984's $4.5 billion rescue ofContinental Illinois of Chicago and last year's $4 billion dealinvolving First RepublicBank of Dallas.   Seidman has said that MCorp is the agency's last remaining majorcommercial bank problem.   However, the FDIC also is reviewing bids for National Bancorp. ofTexas of San Antonio and Texas American Bancshares Inc. of FortWorth, with combined assets of $7 billion. They are likely to besold in a package requiring about $500 million in governmentassistance.   Banc One, the country's 25th largest banking company with $25.3billion in assets, was one of the first institutions to offerautomated tellers and has been a leader in packaging credit carddebt into securities for sale to investors.   The Columbus company allocates more of its earnings to researchand development than most banks, but has remained one of the fivemost profitable banks every year since 1984.   On March 29, the 20 failed MCorp banks, which stretch across muchof Texas including Houston and Dallas, were packaged into agovernment-owned institution called Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank,or DIBB.   The seizure left MCorp with five subsidiary banks, plus trust andinvestment operations, that continue to operate, although the parentcompany has filed for protection from creditors under the federalbankruptcy code.   MCorp also has challenged the takeover of eight of the subsidiarybanks, saying they were solvent at the time they were seized.   Among the other prominent bidders for Bridge Bank were NCNB Corp.of Charlotte, N.C., which bought First RepublicBank last year;Houston-based Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., a subsidiary ofChemical Banking Corp., the nation's sixth largest banking company;First City Bancorp. of Houston, itself the recipient of $1 billionfederal bailout in 1987; the New York-based leveraged buyout firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.; and the Bank of Scotland.   Buddy Kemp, chairman of NCNB Texas, the new name of FirstRepublicBank, said his company was disappointed with the FDIC'sdecision, but added, ``We remain committed to serving the Texasmarket by expanding our franchise throughout the state.''   Kohlberg Kravis, which has no banking interests, said in astatement, ``We are extremely disappointed. We've spent an enormousamount of time, resources and effort on this matter.'' It noted thatits proposal would have maintained an independent bank in Texas.   Analysts have blamed MCorp's failure on the collapse of theenergy market, even though the bank had focused more on real estateloans than energy loans. The collapse of oil prices earlier in the1980s snowballed into a real estate bust and a regional recession inthe Southwest.</TEXT></DOC>
