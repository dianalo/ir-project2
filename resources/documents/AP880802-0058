Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah previously has predicted thatthe fate of the nine American hostages would be determined duringor after the Nov. 8 election.   Today, an Arab-language weekly quoted him as suggesting for thefirst time that freedom for the hostages may come sooner.   ``I do not have any detailed information on the hostages issuewithin the context of U.S.-Iranian relations,'' Fadlallah wasquoted as saying in an interview published by the Paris-basedMostakbal magazine.   ``But I have a feeling that the problem of the hostages is anessential factor in the American presidential election becausetheir card will be of no importance after the elections,'' he wasquoted as saying.   Fadlallah is spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God. Thegroup is believed to be the umbrella organization for Shiitemilitants holding most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   ``My feeling is that the American hostages issue will becompletely resolved just as the issue of the French hostages was,''he was quoted as saying.   The last three French hostages in Lebanon were freed May 4, afew days before the French presidential election.   Fadlallah was quoted as saying the United States and Iran werebound to normalize relations now that the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq waris nearing an end.   On Monday, an Anglican archbishop just back from a mission inTehran said Terry Waite, the kidnapped envoy of the Archbishop ofCanterbury, and the other hostages might be released by the end ofthe year.   ``I would not be surprised if Terry Waite and the others werereleased before the end of the year,'' David Penman, the archbishopfor Melbourne, said in Canterbury, England.   The Church of England last week sent Bishop David Brown toLebanon to speak to Christian leaders about four Iranians whodisappeared in a Christian-controlled zone outside Beirut in 1982.They were presumed kidnapped, and there been unconfirmed reportsthey were killed.   In addition to the nine Americans, the 18 foreign hostagesinclude three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian, an Indian, a WestGerman and two unidentified men.
