 But the talk in the channel has resellers passing upbids for customers who are shopping only for down and dirty prices, and it'sa refreshing turn of events.andM;Jim Heisch, executive vice president of Businessland, conceded recently thathis chain is walking away from sales that fail to meet margin requirements.andM;Businessland, which is perceived as one of the more cutthroat pricers in themarket-share-at-any-cost wars, isn't alone.andM;It's finally dawning on dealers that there's no more fat to cut from coststructures and that they must begin making money on hardware sales.andM;As a result, they're either refusing to get involved in bidding contests inwhich prices drop through the floor, or they're refocusing their marketingtoward customer segments where pricing pressure is less intense.andM;In large measure, the channel has IBM to thank for this development.andP;  But the&quot;cure&quot; was a bitter pill to swallow, and rehabilitation may be the tougheststage of all.andM;Since the phaseout last month of its large-account bonus program, IBM will nolonger subsidize account-control sales to big business.andM;Obviously, this program alone did not cause 1989's dealer margin disaster.andO;But the fact is, it was doomed from inception.andM;When it was unveiled nearly a year ago, I called it a &quot;loaded gun,&quot; andpredicted that dealers would pull the trigger and pass these dollars along tocustomers as discounts.andP;  That's just what they did.andM;Preliminary results of a just-concluded poll of PC Week's Reseller InsightPanel, composed of 500 resellers representing all major channels, indicatethat nearly 90 percent of the respondents concur that the net effect of thisprogram was to contribute to street-price pressure.andM;The channel's dilemma now is explaining to customers who have benefitted fromthe margin erosion bonanza why prices are stabilizing or, better yet,creeping upward.andM;Ed Anderson, executive vice president and chief operating officer ofComputerLand, noted in these pages recently, &quot;I'm cynical that prices everget raised in this business.andP;  But if costs go up, something has to give.&quot;andM;That's an understatement.andM;Much has been written about the intense margin pressure in the channel lastyear.andP;  But it's still shocking when the damage is quantified.andM;Businessland Feels PressureandM;Businessland has always prided itself on comparatively strong margins.andP;  Butfor its first fiscal quarter ended Sept.andP;  30, 1989, the chain's gross marginslumped two points from the prior year, down to 24.5 percent.andM;For The Computer Factory, another price leader, the decline was even moreprecipitous.andP;  This national chain's gross margin for the September quarterplummeted seven full points from the levels logged the year before.andM;Clearly, this is ominous.andP;  But coupled with rising costs, it's lifethreatening.andP;  And that's what costs are doing, climbing.andM;For the September quarter alone, selling, general and administrativeexpenses, as a percent of sales, rose a point for Businessland, year to year,and nearly two points for The Computer Factory.andM;Cost pressures promise to intensify in the future as more complex, advancedtechnology enters the channel and dealers are forced to invest in trainingand programs to sell and support that technology.andM;To survive, there must be a parallel increase in channel profitability.andP;  Andvendors must play a role in making sure that happens.andP;  Whilemarket-development fund programs have been a prime contributor tostreet-price pressure, they must not be abandoned.andP;  But soft-dollar programsmust be more prescriptive; they must have tighter controls to ensure thatdollars are retained in the channel.andM;Dealers, too, must shoulder their share of the responsibility.andP;  Bailing outof the price wars is a start.andM;One can only hope this trend is contagious and that it's not a case of thepatient giving up smoking only after being diagnosed as having cancer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
