Hampton, N.H.-based Signal Energy will own and operate both plants, Henley said. Signal Energy already owns and operates two other alternative energy plants in Sherman Station, Maine, and Norwalk Calif.    Henley said the plant near Redding, Calif. -- a $117 million, 49,000-kilowatt facility to be fueled by wood waste -- would generate electricity for sale to San Francisco-based Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. Henley, a medical technology, engineering and chemicals concern, said the plant will begin operating later this year.    The Pennsylvania plant, an $82 million, 42,000-kilowatt cogeneration facility to be fueled by anthracite coal waste, will supply electricity to Pennsylvania Power andamp; Light Co. and Pennsylvania's Frackville Correctional Institution. Henley said it expects this plant to begin operating in December 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
