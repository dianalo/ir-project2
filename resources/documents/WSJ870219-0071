The Big Board's new requirements come as legislators are starting to push for new laws curbing takeover activities and arbitrage trading.    Many in the securities industry have opposed such laws, arguing that any policing efforts should be undertaken within the industry.    The oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of Congress, have been looking into possible shortcomings in the Big Board's self-regulation program.    &quot;They should have gotten on top of this long ago,&quot; asserted Peter Stockton, an aide to Michigan Democrat John Dingell, the committee chairman. &quot;It's their responsibility. But they're mesmerized by their (trading-surveillance) machines and they don't have enough investigators.&quot;    Among the new requirements, the exchange ordered member firms to certify every quarter that they have made sure all employee and proprietary trading complies with securities laws and exchange rules.    Firms will also have to give the exchange a quarterly report of customer complaint letters and an annual report about compliance problems.    In addition, the exchange said it will improve its own surveillance systems, increase penalties for late responses to information requests in its investigations and increase the use of on-the-record questioning in investigations.    In Washington, Securities and Exchange Commission officials commended the Big Board's initiatives.    &quot;We welcome the New York Stock Exchange's steps to improve their surveillance and tighten up their compliance functions,&quot; said Richard Ketchum, director of market regulation. &quot;We think it's a terrific beginning.&quot; He said he was pleased that the exchange intends to improve its liaison with the SEC.    However, one SEC staffer questioned why the exchange hadn't undertaken the regulatory improvements long before the insider-trading scandal broke. </TEXT></DOC>
