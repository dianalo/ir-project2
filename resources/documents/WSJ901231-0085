Born in 1889, he was the eighth andyoungest child of a Viennese family of assimilated Jews ofenormous wealth and cultural sophistication. Gustave Klimtpainted his parents' wedding portrait; for his pianistbrother Paul, Maurice Ravel composed a concerto for left handafter he lost his right arm in World War I.   Standards of taste and proficiency ran high in thisexquisite and fastidious clan; so did accompanying stressesand torments. No less than three of Ludwig's brotherscommitted suicide. At 19, already handsome, lonely andintense, Ludwig went to Manchester, England, as anaeronautical engineer. It was the heroic age of airpioneering, and Ludwig wanted to build and fly his own plane.</LP><TEXT>   But a bent toward the abstract drove him shyly andhesitantly to Cambridge to study under Bertrand Russell,whose revolutionary &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot; reducedphilosophy to logic. Russell was captivated and exasperatedby this obnoxious apprentice: &quot;My German engineer, I think,is a fool. He thinks nothing empirical is knowable -- I askedhim to admit that there was not a rhinoceros in the room, buthe wouldn't.&quot; But as Wittgenstein began to outgallop themaster intellectually and spiritually, Russell's tune soonchanged to &quot;I love him and feel he will solve the problems Iam too old to solve.&quot;   But Ludwig went home in 1914 to enlist in the AustrianArmy, where he served in logistics on the Galician front, inartillery on the Russian front, and finally as a POW on theItalian front. During these five tempestuous and formativeyears in uniform, he wrote the major work published in hislifetime, the 1921 &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; (theclumsy title is an allusion to Spinoza's equally clumsy&quot;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus&quot;). In form the book is aseries of separate, numbered, aphoristic paragraphs; inspirit it is an uneasy wedding of Ludwig's Cambridge logic toa Tolstoyan mysticism cultivated under fire. It affirms thatmeaningful language is limited to propositions about fact,but then declares that all this is but a ladder to be thrownaway. Ending with the famous aphorism &quot;Whereof one cannotspeak, thereof one must be silent,&quot; it follows Kant in itsimplication that God and ethics are true features of realitybut ineffable.   After the war, Ludwig tried teaching grammar school in asuccession of Austrian villages. His pedagogy showed acharacteristic combination of empathy and impatience; heawoke the faster pupils with imaginative presentations ofastronomy, biology, botany and architecture, while inflicting&quot;ear-boxing&quot; and &quot;hairpulling&quot; on the slow or dishonest. Heproduced with none of the endless fuss that impeded his adultwritings a superb spelling dictionary for children, gardenedfor a while in a monastery, and designed a severelygeometrical house for a sister in Vienna. Then he grudginglyreturned to Cambridge in 1933 to teach philosophy. He was toremain on its faculty for most of the rest of his life (hehad given away his inherited fortune, which had briefly madehim one of the richest men in Europe). This most influentialof academics hated academe, urged his favorites to defectfrom philosophy to medicine or factory work, and indeed sawphilosophy itself as something to be cleared away in favor ofa life of fiercely self-denying austerity.   Physically, he was forever fleeing the university for longperiods of roughing it in spartan climes -- Iceland, Norway,the wild Irish coast and, very briefly, Stalin's Russia,which apparently proved too spartan even for him. He spentsome of World War II as a medical orderly in Newcastle; hedied of cancer in Cambridge in 1951 and was given a Catholicburial. His last years he spent jotting down questions aboutlanguage and meaning, but the exact questions have come tomatter less than the saintly tone of the questioner.   As the critic Guy Davenport put it, &quot;Disciples who came tohim expecting to find a man of incredibly deep learning founda man who saw mankind held together by suffering alone, andhe invariably advised them to be as kind as possible toothers.&quot; He seemed like those mystics specializing insweeping away verbal and other obstacles blocking the nakedcontemplation of God. He did the sweeping in what he wrote;he did the contemplating in how he lived.   Mr. Monk's book works well enough on the anecdotal,day-to-day level. He also gives a quiet and credible accountof Wittgenstein's homosexual loves and friendships with shyyoung disciples, eschewing both the sensational distortionsand the stuffy denials that have marred recent writing onthis sensitive topic. But Mr. Monk is not up to painting anorganically convincing picture of the sage. His presentationof the very difficult philosophy is skimpy, random andcontext-less; he does better but is still inadequate onWittgenstein's constant and profound entanglement withconcerns of the spirit. Saint and thinker remain too dim andtoo far apart in this readable but finally unsatisfying life.   ---   Mr. Lyons is a free-lance critic living in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
