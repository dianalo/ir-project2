Introduction and Background </ITAG>On October 2, 1987, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'')submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''),pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change to list for trading a new broad-basedmarket index option contract based on the International Market Index (``IMI'')_agroup of 50 foreign stocks and American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')\3\<NOTE/> traded on the Amex or the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'')or quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations(``NASDAQ'') system.\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ ADRs are negotiable certificates representing ownershipof shares in a non-U.S. company. They are quoted and traded in U.S. dollarsin the U.S. securities markets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Pursuant to section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Commodity ExchangeAct (``CEA''), as amended by the Futures Trading Act of 1982 to reflectthe terms of the jurisdictional accord between the Commission and the CommodityFutures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), the Commission forwarded to theCFTC a letter not objecting to the designation of the Coffee, Sugar, andCocoa Exchange (``CSCE'') as a contract market to trade futures on theIMI Stock Index. <T3>See </T3>Letter from Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, to Dr. PaulaA. Tosini, Director, Division of Economic Analysis, CFTC, dated September1, 1988. On December 15, 1988, the CFTC approved the designation of theCSCE as a contract market for trading futures on the IMI. The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 25482 (March 17, 1988) 53 FR 9528. No comments were received on theproposed rule change. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Proposal </ITAG>The IMI is a capitalization-weighted index \5\<NOTE/> exclusively based on the prices of 50 foreign stocks whosedomicile is located in the European Community,\6\<NOTE/> Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. The Index component stocksare traded in the U.S. either directly or as ADRs on the Amex, the NYSE,or through the NASDAQ system. All of the securities to be used in calculatingthe Index are registered with the SEC under the Act or are exempt fromsuch registration under SEC Rule 12g3-2 \7\<NOTE/> or section 12(f) \8\<NOTE/> of the Act. The Amex proposes to trade standardized European-style(exercise at expiration only) options based on this new Index.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In a capitalization-weighted index, the relative weightof an issue in the total index value is determined by multiplying the priceper share of a security by the total number of such securities outstanding.The total number of outstanding shares of the IMI components include thoseheld by corporate insiders. In addition, as of December 31, 1988, the over-the-counter(``OTC'') components of the IMI accounted for 36.87% of the capitalizationweight of the Index. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The members of the European Community which have companiescurrently included in the IMI are Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (``U.K.''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 17 CFR 240.12g3-2 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 15 U.S.C. 78(1)(f) (1982).  Options on the IMI would be traded pursuant to current Exchange rules governingthe trading of index options.\9\<NOTE/> These rules govern matters such as disclosure, account approvaland suitability, position and exercise limits, margin, and trading haltsand suspensions.\10\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See </T3>Amex Rules 900C-980C. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26198 (October 19, 1988),53 FR 41637 which provides for a one hour trading halt in all index optionstraded on the Amex if the Dow Jones Industrial Average declines 250 pointsfrom the previous day's closing value. The Index will be calculated and maintained by the Amex between 9:30 a.m.and 4:15 p.m., New York time, based on the trading of actual shares orADR prices of component securities in U.S. markets. In calculating theIndex, last sale price information for exchange-traded and NASDAQ NationalMarket System (``NMS'') \11\<NOTE/> securities, and the arithmetic mean between the highest bidprice and the lowest offer price as quoted on the NASDAQ market, for NASDAQnon-NMS securities, will be used. The Index value for purposes of settlingspecific IMI contracts will be calculated on the basis of ADR opening prices(or prices of the component stocks) in the U.S. markets for exchange tradedsecurities and on the arithmetic mean of the NASDAQ inside market at 9:30a.m. New York City time for NASDAQ NMS and non-NMS securities on the businessday prior to the expiration date of the contracts, normally the Fridaypreceding expiration Saturday. The information will be disseminated tovendors through the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') system.A benchmark Index value of 200.00 has been established for the Index asof January 2, 1987. On December 28, 1988, the closing Index value was 300.42.The index multiplier will be 100.\12\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ National Market System securities are those equity securities,both on exchanges and in the OTC market, for which real-time transactionreporting is required. <T3>See </T3>Rules 11Aa2-1 and 11Aa3-1 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.11Aa2-1and 240.11Aa3-1 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ An index multiplier is a number which determines thetotal dollar value of each point of the difference between the exerciseprice of an option and the current level of the underlying index. A multiplierof 100 means that for each point by which an option is in the money, thereis a $100 increase in intrinsic value. In order to be included in the Index the minimum market value in U.S. dollarsof a foreign security, as measured by total worldwide shares outstanding,must be $100 million. In addition, at least 75% of the Index's componentstocks each must have a minimum average monthly trading volume over a sixmonth period in the U.S. market of 50,000 ADRs (or shares if the componentdoes not trade as ADRs in the U.S.).\13\<NOTE/> Also, if the security is traded through the NASDAQ system,the minimum number of market makers regularly making markets in the securitymust be eight. Moreover, the spreads between the bid and offer prices quotedfor the NASDAQ securities must be reasonable in relation to the spreadsfor other securities traded through the NASDAQ system having similar tradingcharacteristics and selling in the same general price range.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The remaining 25% of the index's component stocks eachmust have a minimum average monthly trading volume over a six month periodin the U.S. market of 20,000 ADRs (or shares if the component does nottrade as ADRs in the U.S.). In maintaining the Index, the Amex reserves the right to substitute stocksor to increase the number of stocks included in the Index, based on changinginternational conditions or newly developed foreign equity securities tradedin U.S. domestic markets.\14\<NOTE/> The component weight of Index stocks will be periodicallyadjusted to account for certain corporate events such as additional stockissuances or repurchases, stock splits, or stock dividends. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The Amex requires that the IMI include a minimum of 50stocks and that these 50 stocks continue to maintain certain eligibilitycriteria. In maintaining the Index, the Exchange will make an effort toensure country dispersion within Europe and the Pacific Basin and industrydispersion across major manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. TheCommission believes that a significant increase in the number of stockscurrently included in the index would represent a material change to theterms of the Amex contract and require a re-examination of the contractby the Commission. In addition, a significant increase or reduction ofweighting in the various national markets comprising the Index also wouldrequire Commission re-examination.  The stocks comprising the IMI currently represent ten countries and approximately20 different industry groups, including electronics, automobile companies,airlines, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, and financial institutions.Currently, the three highest capitalization-weighted countries comprisingthe Index are Japan, U.K., and the Netherlands with weights of 54.97%,22.81%, and 9.36%, respectively. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion </ITAG>The IMI is the first stock index option contract exclusively based on stocksfrom non-U.S./Canadian countries. In addition, the IMI is the first indexoption based on ADR and foreign stock prices in the U.S. market. The uniquestructure of the IMI raises several concerns in connection with the tradingof an option on the index. First, the market for ADRs may be significantly less active or liquid thantrading of the actual shares in the home country.\1\\5\<NOTE/> Second, many of the actual underlying shares comprising theIMI, especially the Japanese stocks, are traded on their foreign-basedhome markets during periods in which the ADRs are not being actively tradedin the U.S. markets. Third, complete surveillance of the option is limitedby the fact that the execution of surveillance sharing agreements betweenthe Amex and all foreign exchanges on which IMI component stocks principallytrade would be difficult. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussedbelow, that the Amex adequately has addressed these concerns.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>See, </T3><T3>e.g., </T3>DeMaria, The Case Against Japanese A.D.R.s, <T3>N.Y. Times, </T3>Oct. 23, 1988, at F8, col. 3. There are several situations,however, in which the market for ADRs of IMI component stocks is more activeor liquid than trading in certain IMI home markets. For example, KLM RoyalDutch Air has an Average Daily Volume (``ADV'') in the Netherlands of 4,000shares but an ADV of approximately 108,000 ADRs (representing 108,000 shares)in the U.S. In addition, Pharmacia AB has an ADV of 33,000 shares in Swedenbut an ADV of approximately 158,000 ADRs (representing 118,500 shares)in the U.S. A. Index Design and Structure The broad diversification, large capitalization, and liquid markets ofthe Index's components stocks significantly minimize the potential formanipulation on the companies' home markets. The ten most highly capitalizedstocks in the IMI account for approximately 55% of the Index's cumulativemarket value.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Although Toyota accounts for 11.28% of the IMI's cumulativemarket value, manipulation of the Index through trading in Toyota is mademore difficult because the stock is widely held and actively traded.\1\\7\<NOTE/> Further, the index components are highly capitalized. Theindex component with the smallest capitalization was Norsk Data at $214.6million, and the median and mean capitalization for the 50 firms was $5.02billion and $9.63 billion, respectively.\1\\8\<NOTE/> Moreover, the home markets for most of the Index's componentsare quite active.\1\\9\<NOTE/> Although several component stocks are lightly traded on theirhome market, they are actively traded as ADRs in the U.S.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ By comparison the 10 most highly price-weighted stocksin the Major Market Index (``XMI'') account for approximately 70% of thatIndex's cumulative market value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Toyota's ADV between September 1987 and April 1988,on its home market, was 1,487,000 shares. Its ADV in the U.K. and U.S.during that same period of time was 50,000 shares and 26,600 shares (afteradjusting for ADR-Share Ratio), respectively. In addition, as of June 1988,the total ADR float for Toyota was 1,120,031.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Of the 50 securities comprising the IMI, 27 are listedon the NYSE, one on the Amex, and the balance are in the NASDAQ system(l5 of the 22 NASDAQ issues are NMS securities). Although the minimum numberof market makers required to make markets regularly in the NASDAQ componentissues is eight, at the present time the number of registered market makersfor the NASDAQ issues exceeds that minimum requirement; each IMI NASDAQissue has at least 12 market makers, and 12 of the issues (representingapproximately 25% of the capitalization weight of the Index) have morethan 20 market makers. In this regard, the Amex informed the Commissionthat no single market maker (or small group of market makers) dominatesthe trading in any particular NASDAQ issue which is a component of theIMI. Telephone conversation on August 31, 1988, between Steven Bloom, AssistantVice President, New Products Development, Amex, and Ivan Davis, Attorney,Division of Market Regulation, SEC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ As of June 1, 1988, the mean ADV for IMI's 50 componentson their home markets was 1,767,100 shares. In addition, the index inclusion criteria provide that at least 75% ofthe IMI component stocks must have an average monthly trading volume overthe previous six month period in the U.S. market of at least 50,000 ADRs(or shares if the component does not trade as ADRs in the U.S.) and theremaining 25% of the component stocks must have average monthly tradingvolumes of no less than 20,000 ADRs (or shares if the component does nottrade as ADRs in the U.S.) over this same period. The Japanese ADRs raisespecial concerns due to their heavy (55%) weighting in the IMI, the factthat trading in the home market closes 8\1/2\ hours before the IMI opening,and the instances of shortages in Japanese ADRs.\2\\0\<NOTE/> Based on correspondence from the Amex and ADR banks, however,it is the Commission's understanding that because ADRs are freely convertibleinto the ordinary shares which they represent, the Japanese ADRs are notnecessarily less liquid or more volatile than the market for their underlyingshares.\2\\1\<NOTE/> ADR bankers note that if purchase (sale) orders for JapaneseADRs can not be filled in the U.S. market, orders are easily filled throughthe conversion mechanism by creating new ADRs. Thus, Japanese ADR volatilityand liquidity in the U.S. is a reflection of volatility and liquidity inthe underlying foreign shares. In this regard, the Amex notes that theaverage annualized volatility of the present IMI components is 35.5% comparedto 29.0% for the Amex's Institutional Index (``XII'').\2\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ <T3>See </T3>note 24 <T3>infral</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ <T3>See </T3>Letter from Nathan Most, Vice President, New Products Development,Amex, to Brandon Becker, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation,SEC, dated November l8, 1988, enclosing letter from Joseph M. Velli, VicePresident, ADR Division, Bank of New York, to Lawrence DeMaria, Reporter,Financial Section, <T3>N.Y. Times, </T3>dated October 26, 1988, and letter from Ralph Marinello,Vice President, ADRs, Irving Trust, to Editor, <T3>N.Y. Times, </T3>dated October 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ The Amex suggests that the slightly higher volatilityof the IMI components is largely attributable to foreign exchange ratemovements, and that therefore IMI component ADRs are no more volatile thanmost U.S. blue chip securities. See Letter from Nathan Most, Vice President,New Products Development, Amex, to Brandon Becker, Associate Director,Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated November 18, 1988. Furthermore,the Amex provided data indicating that for the 15 Japanese securities includedin the IMI, the average weekly volatility for the ADRs over the last 60weeks was 30.473 compared to an average weekly volatility for the underlyingstocks for the same period of 30.326. In addition, the Japanese securitywith the largest annualized volatility divergence between ADR and underlyingshare is Ito Yokado with an ADR annualized volatility of 26.8% and an annualizedvolatility of 24.2% for the underlying share. <T3>See </T3>Letter from Steven Bloom, Assistant Vice President, New ProductsDevelopment, Amex, to Joseph Furey, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation,SEC, dated December 23, 1988.Finally, based on data concerning the SEC-registered ADR levels versusthe actual number of outstanding ADRs, the Commission believes that, whilenot impossible, it would be difficult to effect a physical squeeze in anyof the current ADR components in IMI because the actual ADRs outstandingare substantially below the ceiling represented by SEC registration     levels.\23\<NOTE/> Moreover, discussions between Commission staff and ADR tradersand bankers have revealed extensive systems and procedures by which ADRbanks monitor outstanding float versus SEC registration levels. When thefloat levels begin to approach SEC registration levels the appropriateparties (<T3>e.g.,</T3> ADR banks) submit filings to the Commission to increaseregistration levels and those filings generally are processed expeditiouslyby the Commission.\24\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ As of December 28, 1988, the two IMI component stockswhose actual outstanding ADR levels were closest to their SEC-registeredADR levels were KLM Royal Dutch (representing 0.2% of the capitalizationweight of the Index) with approximately 12,366,955 ADRs outstanding and15,000,000 SEC-registered ADRs and Beecham Group PLC (representing 1.26%of the capitalization weight of the Index) with approximately 19,779,000ADRs outstanding and 20,000,000 SEC-registered ADRs. The Commission notesthat Morgan Guaranty has filed a standard F-6 registration statement foran additional 20,000,000 Beecham Group ADRs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ The Commission notes, however, that temporary shortagesof ADRs have occurred in the past, especially in Japanese securities, andcould affect ADR prices on a short term basis. <T3>See </T3>Sandler, Scarcity of Sony ADRs Helps Teach Lessons About CertainIntricacies of Global Trading, <T3>Wall St. J.</T3>, Sept. 17, 1987, at 69, col. 3. Due to the variednationality of the Index's ADRs and the relatively low capitalization weightingof the largest component ADRs, the Commission believes it would be difficultto manipulate the Index through the creation of ADR shortages. B. lnternationalArbitrage Aside from Index design, international ADR arbitrage will help to alleviateconcerns over the relatively smaller ADR trading volume and will help toensure that ADR prices reflect the pricing on the home market. The Commissionunderstands that international arbitrage between the U.S. and the U.K.market for ADRs makes it difficult to affect significantly the prices ofthe component ADRs of the Index. Specifically, when spreads develop betweenthe home market share prices and U.S. ADR prices, active ADR traders (usuallyin London or New York) will sell ADRs if the ADR trades at a premium toits underlying security. Similarly, if the ADR were trading at a discountto its underlying shares, arbitrage traders will purchase the ADRs, convertthem into the underlying shares, and sell these shares at a profit in aforeign market trading the security. This arbitrage will act to limit theamount ADR prices in U.S. markets are out of line with home country pricesor ADR prices in the U.K. International arbitrage also will help ensure more reliable price determinationsfor settlement purposes.\25\<NOTE/> Any abnormal price changes occurring in a component issue(in particular a Japanese component) or in foreign currency  exchange ratesduring the interim between the closing of foreign home markets and theopening of the U.S. markets should be ameliorated by New York and Londonarbitrageurs in the London marketplace, as stocks comprising 94% of thecapitalization weight of the Index actively trade on the SEAQ International\26\<NOTE/> (mean ADV of 777,000 shares).\27\<NOTE/> For exchange traded ADRs in particular, the single-priceauction opening on the NYSE or Amex will reflect pre-opening interest fromarbitrageurs and the scrutiny that arbitrageurs will give to the settingof the opening price. For NASDAQ ADRs, many of the market makers submitpre-opening quotations, which also are subject to scrutiny by arbitrageursand help to ensure that the opening quotation is reflective of competitivemarket maker activity. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ ADR opening prices will occur either during active tradingin foreign markets such as the U.K., where trading actually overlaps theopening of the U.S. markets, or after the close of trading in other markets,such as Japan, where the previous day's trading will have ceased 8\1/2\hours prior to the opening of the U.S. markets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ The Stock Exchange Automated Quotations Internationalis the electronic communications facility of the International Stock Exchange(``ISE'') covering international equities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ The Amex informed the Commission that conversations ithad with several ADR bankers and traders revealed that international arbitragemechanisms (<T3>e.g.</T3>, conversion of ADRs into underlying shares and vice versa)continued to function during the volatile period in October 1987. Telephoneconversation on August 2, 1988, between Steven Bloom, Assistant Vice President,New Products Development, Amex, and Ivan Davis, Attorney, Division of MarketRegulation, SEC. C. Amex Surveillance Due to the unique composition of the IMI and the special concerns emanatingfrom reliance on ADR prices, the Amex has developed a special surveillanceprogram for the IMI. First,   all the procedures which currently applyto the Amex's existing stock index options surveillance program will applyto surveillance of the IMI.\28\<NOTE/> Second, in response to the international nature of the Index,the Amex will conduct additional surveillance of Japanese and Europeanstocks with capitalization weights in excess of 2.0% of the Index. Currently,these stocks represent approximately 65% of the entire capitalization weightof the Index. The Amex will capture on a daily basis, among other things,the following information for these stocks: (1) Tokyo market closing priceinformation for Japanese components; (2) London market trade and quoteinformation for the period extending from \1/2\ hour before U.S. tradingbegins to the overlap period between U.S. and London trading for U.K. stocks;and (3) U.S. market trade information for NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ NMS securitiesand quote information for NASDAQ non-NMS securities for the first hourof U.S. trading. The Amex will use this data to compare the opening pricesin component stocks on ADRs with the closing prices in Japan and transactionsbeing executed in the U.K. in an attempt to identify aberrant prices inthe IMI at the opening of U.S. trading and any other unusual trading activity. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ In response to Commission concerns regarding openingsettlement prices for NASDAQ IMI components, in addition to their regularoption surveillance procedures, on expiration days the Amex will conductspecial procedures to examine market maker activity and quotation changesin the NASDAQ IMI components. <T3>See </T3>Letter from Nathan Most, Vice President, New Products Development,AMEX, to Joseph Furey, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC,dated February 8, 1989.Third, the Commission consistently has noted that, to ensure that stockindex options are not readily susceptible to manipulation, surveillancesharing agreements between the exchange on which the index option tradesand the markets that trade the underlying securities are necessary. Theexchange of surveillance data by the exchange trading a stock index optionand the markets for the securities comprising the index is important tothe detection and deterrence of intermarket manipulation. In this regard,the Commission notes that the Amex has the necessary surveillance sharingarrangement with the exchanges whose ADRs comprise the Index. Specifically,the Amex, NYSE, and National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'')are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group. As members, these marketsare required to share surveillance information with one another. Due to the fact that the home country trading of foreign securities canimpact ADR prices in the U.S., the Commission believes that the Amex alsoshould secure surveillance sharing agreements with the relevant foreignexchanges. Because U.K. and Japanese securities represent 77.78% of theweighting of the Index, the Commission has agreed with Amex's suggestionthat, at least initially, the Exchange need only secure agreements withthe two markets in these countries.\29\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ The majority of the component stocks of the countriescomprising the remaining 22% of the Index (the Netherlands_9.36%, Australia_3.48%,Sweden_3.39%, Spain_2.06%, Denmark, Italy, and Norway combined_2.53%, andHong Kong_1.42%) are more actively traded in the U.S.than on their homemarkets.Nevertheless, the Commission, of course, encourages the Amex to pursuesuch agreements with the countries whose stocks comprise the remaining22% of the Index as a separate matter.In regard to British stocks, the Amex has executed a surveillance sharingagreement with The Securities Association (``TSA'').\30\<NOTE/> This surveillance agreement will permit the Amex to obtain,where appropriate, trade and clearance information relating to U.K. securitiesunderlying the IMI,\31\<NOTE/> whether relating to a member(s) of Amex or TSA. Such surveillanceinformation may include information concerning the identity and tradingactivities of individual customers as well as member firms.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Provisionof Information for the Purpose of Regulation and Enforcement, dated Octoberl3, 1988 (``Amex/TSA MOU''). TSA came into existence as a result of anagreement between the ISE and the International Securities Regulatory Organization(``ISRO''). Under the terms of the agreement, the ISE was established asa recognized investment exchange with rights and obligations analogousto the NASD, and ISRO was reorganized as the TSA. Currently, the TSA isthe selfregulatory organization responsible for regulating the U.K. equitysecurities market. Although all ISE members must be members of the TSA,TSA also consists of members which may not be active on the ISE. Thus,the Amex/TSA MOU will allow the Amex to obtain trading data from more U.K.securities market participants, whose activity may affect the IMI, thanwould an Amex/ISE agreement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Pursuant to the Amex/TSA MOU all securities traded throughthe SEAQ International, including foreign ADRs, are considered U.K. securities.In regard to Japanese component stocks, the Amex has executed a surveillancesharing agreement with the Tokyo Stock  Exchange (``TSE'') which obligatesthe parties to use their best efforts to compile and transmit informationrelating to ``transactions on the [Amex or TSE], price quotations, clearingdata, and the identity of persons holding large positions in IMI optionsor the underlying stocks.'' \32\<NOTE/> The Amex/TSE Agreement also provides that the parties willresolve in good faith any disagreements regarding requests for such informationor responses thereto. Although the Amex/TSE Agreement represents a substantialadvance in regulatory cooperation between U.S. and Japanese securitiesmarkets it does contain several provisions that raise concerns as to theability of the Amex to obtain information from the TSE in all cases.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Agreement Between the American Stock Exchange, Inc. andthe Tokyo Stock Exchange to Share Market Surveillance Information (``Amex/TSEAgreement''), dated November 4, I988. The TSE signed substantially identicalagreements with the Chicago Board of Trade (``CBT'') to cover trading ofthe CBT's TOPIX Index and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') tocover trading of the CME's Nikkei Stock Average futures, as well as anycontracts listed in the future. In particular, the SEC is concerned about the operation of Article 106of the Japanese Securities and Exchange Law \33\<NOTE/> as  it relates to the surveillance sharing agreement, andabout confidentiality provisions in sections 2D and 3 of the agreement.The SEC, however, has discussed with the TSE its concerns regarding theseprovisions,\34\<NOTE/> and has received assurances from the TSE as to its willingnessto provide information to the extent not prohibited by law.\35\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Article 106 provides: ``No person who is or has beenan officer or employee of a securities exchange shall divulge or make surreptitioususe of secrets which he may have acquired in the course of performing hisduties.'' Secret information, which includes the identity of persons holdinglarge positions, could be divulged, however, ``where the legal interestof making the information available is deemed greater than that of keepingthe information confidential.''

The relevant provision is Article 154 of the Japanese Securitiesand Exchange Law.D. Market Impact The Commission believes that the listing and trading of IMI options onthe Amex will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets inthe U.S. First, as previously mentioned, existing Amex stock index optionsrules and surveillance procedures will apply to option contracts basedon the IMI. Second, the Commission notes that the Index is broadbased anddiversified and includes highly capitalized securities that generally aretraded actively on their primary securities exchanges in addition to othersecurities markets abroad. In this regard, the Commission does not believethat the IMI will impact adversely foreign markets in which the underlyingstocks or ADRs are traded. The Commission believes that the availability of options on the IMI shouldhelp to remove impediments to a free and open global market and shouldfacilitate transactions in securities because the IMI option will provideinvestors with a means to hedge exposure to market or systematic risk associatedwith foreign stock investments. The Commission believes further that the trading of listed options on anindex of foreign stocks will provide investors with a valuable hedgingvehicle that should reflect accurately the overall movement of foreignstocks, especially Japanese and U.K. stocks.\37\<NOTE/> The IMI also will contribute further to the increasing internationalizationof the world's securities markets. The Commission also believes that theIMI option will provide investors a means by which to make investment decisionsin the non-U.S./Canadian world equity market, thus allowing them to establishpositions or increase existing positions in foreign stocks cost efficiently.Finally, the Commission notes that investors also could pursue a strategydesigned to supplement their dividend income by writing options on theIMI.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ In contrast to CEA regulations, the federal securitieslaws do not contain an explicit ``economic purpose'' test for new optionsproducts. Nevertheless, pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act the Commissionmust predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding thatthe introduction of such option is in the public interest. Such a findingwould be difficult with respect to an option product that served no hedgingor other economic function, because any benefits that might be derivedby market participants would likely be outweighed by the potential formanipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets,and other valid regulatory concerns. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
