Union and corporate contributions to state and local politicalparties for activities that are not directly used on federalelections are generally known as ``soft money.'' The national partyorganizations _ the Republican National Committee and DemocraticNational Committee _ also collect and disburse soft money in avariety of ways permitted by federal law.   These funds are not required by law to be reported at thefederal level. And only some states have strict reportingrequirements.   The Center for Responsive Politics said it identified $3.3million in corporate contributions to political parties in fivestates in the 1985-86 election cycle _ California, Colorado,Florida, Missouri and Washington.   ``This amount, if multiplied nationwide, would blossom into anenormous sum, despite the fact that there was no presidential raceto boost contributions even higher,'' said Ellen S. Miller,executive director of the center.   Noting that nearly a billion dollars is tallied in reports tothe Federal Election Commission on spending for congressionalcampaigns and presidential races, she added, ``Lying just below thesurface are untold millions of additional dollars unaccounted forby the FEC.''   The money can be used for such activities as state conventions,voter registration drives, research, office expenses andget-out-the-vote drives.   Soft money plays an important role in presidential electionyears, since the major parties' presidential campaigns are paid forby the U.S. Treasury and the amounts the national parties can spendin addition are limited.   Republicans have traditionally raised far more in soft moneythan Democrats, but the finance chairman for Democratic nomineeMichael Dukakis has talked of raising $42 million in soft money forthe fall campaign.   Based on reports filed with the five states involved, the centeridentified the following amounts in corporate contributions tostate parties in 1985-86:   California: Republicans, $808,290; Democrats, $295,389.   Colorado: Republicans, $645,888; Democrats, $71,050.   Florida: Republicans, $466,445; Democrats, $458,258.   Missouri: Republicans, $369,482; Democrats, $22,400.   Washington: Republicans, $129,776; Democrats, $31,250.   The center identified about 1,700 soft money contributions inthese states, almost all of them from corporations.   In its report, the center said American Continental Corp. ofPhoenix gave $85,000 to the California Democratic Party in 1986,while Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles gave a total of $89,000to the two state parties.   The largest individual contribution identified by the center wasby Charles Keating, chairman of the board of American Continental,who gave $100,000 to the Florida GOP.   The report referred to the publicly disclosed contribution of $1million by McDonald's heir Joan Kroc to the DNC. At most, $20,000of that could be used on federal elections under the law, meaningat least $980,000 would have to go into the DNC's soft-moneyaccounts.   The report also noted published reports of gifts to the RNCtotaling $150,000 from Texas developer Trammell Crow, $127,600 fromPhillip Morris Corp. and $124,000 from Atlantic Richfield.   Corporate and union money can also be used to pay for buildingsfor the national parties. The report mentioned contributions to theDemocratic building funds of $50,000 from the painters' union,$10,000 from the United Auto Workers and $5,000 from themachinists' union.   It cited contributions to the RNC fund of $40,000 from BethlehemSteel and $24,120 from Drexel, Burnham, Lambert.</TEXT></DOC>
