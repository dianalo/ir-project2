<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0566 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method and an apparatus are described for increasing the quantity ofproduction of glass fibers while avoiding increased energy and whilemaintaining the unique temperature distribution which occurs at the circumferentialwall is a raised to increase the quantity of glass fiber production ofwhen glass fibers are produced out of so-called hard glass. Such a temperaturedistribution means that the temperature in the center region of the cirumferentialwall is the highest of all, the temperature in the upper region of thecircumferential wall is lower than the center region, and the temperaturein the lower region is lower than the upper region. The invention utilizesa centrifugal force and blast flame flow.</TEXT></DOC>
