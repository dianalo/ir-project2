REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two years ago they were heroes _idealistic young officers whose mutiny helped spark the revoltagainst Ferdinand Marcos. Now they are in disgrace, victims of therevolution they helped inspire.   On Feb. 22, 1986, the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, or RAM,a clique of young officers angry over corruption in the Marcosmilitary, mutinied.   Their action tapped a groundswell of opposition that began afterthe 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, and itled to a popular revolt backed by clergy and joined by hundreds ofthousands of civilians.   President Marcos fled the country on Feb. 26, and PresidentCorazon Aquino took office. RAM leaders such as Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan were hailed as heroes in the finest tradition ofservice to the nation.   But on the second anniversary of what is known as the ``EDSArevolution,'' Honasan is in detention aboard a navy ship for hisrole in the Aug. 28 coup attempt that left at least 53 people deadand hundreds wounded.   Two other RAM members, Navy Capt. Rex Robles and Air Force Lt.Col. Eduardo ``Red'' Kapunan, have been detained in connection withthe Nov. 13, 1986, murder of leftist leader Rolando Olalia.Officials say three other RAM officers are being sought in thekilling.   Late Monday, on the anniversary of the mutiny, military policeprevented Robles from attending a mass organized by Honasan's wifeJane to commemorate the RAM contribution to Marcos' downfall. Hewas hustled away into a jeep by military police as he headed forthe church with his wife.   ``In a broad historical sense, the crackdown on this groupillustrates the continuing cannibalism of the `revolution' whichhas already gobbled up several of its leading actors,'' wrotecommentator Amando Doronila in The Manila Chronicle.   ``The political landscape has changed favorably in favor ofgiving a little more stable base for democratic government,'' headded. ``But it is not yet time to be confident that stability willendure. The revolution has not yet run its course _ it can turn onits other leaders.''   The series of military coup plots and the strong desire amongmost Filipinos for civilian leadership cost the RAM factionwhatever favorable image it once enjoyed among the generalpopulation.   But other key figures in the anti-Marcos struggle have also beeneased out of positions of leadership in the political turmoil ofthe past two years.   Chief among them were former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile,the RAM patron and leader of the military mutiny, former ExecutiveSecretary Joker Arroyo, and former Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin.   Enrile, now a senator, was fired Nov. 23, 1986, after thegovernment said it foiled a coup plot by officers close to thelongtime defense chief.   Arroyo, once Mrs. Aquino's closest adviser, was fired lastSeptember amid charges by the military that he was a communistsympathizer, a charge the former human rights lawyer vigorouslydenied.   Ongpin, an industrialist who helped rally the business communitybehind Mrs. Aquino, was fired along with Arroyo in a Cabinetshakeup in the wake of the August coup attempt.   He committed suicide three months later, and his family said hewas despondent over the rancor and bitterness within the AquinoCabinet.   Filipino commentators believe the turmoil was due in large partto the lack of political consensus within a disparate coalitionwhich shared the goal of ousting Marcos but differed widely on avision for the country's future once the longtime strongman wasgone.   Monday, Enrile released a letter which he said he received fromHonasan to mark the second anniversary of the revolt against Marcos.   ``Although there is no real cause for celebration now becauseour aspirations in 1986 have not yet been realized, it is wellworth the time to pray and remember,'' Honasan wrote.   ``I also pray that all of us still share in the elusive dream oftrue reconciliation, peace and a better life for our people.''</TEXT></DOC>
