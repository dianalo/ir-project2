Equivalent performancewas demonstrated for graphitized and nongraphitized carbon black supportsas shown, although the corrosion rates are at least two orders of magnitudedifferent. The most corrosion resistant material tested to-date is a2700{sup 0}C heat treated carbon black from Cabot Corporation known asBlack Pearls 2000. A comparison of typical corrosion rates is shown.Performance measurements at various potentials and pressures have beenperformed to assess the effect of changes in corrosion rate. Operationin the range of 700 mV and 850 mV and 1 atm to 120 psia revealed no basicdifference in the performance loss behavior even though the carbon catalystsupport had very different apparent corrosion rates. A loss in activitywas observed for all materials. Apparently there is a loss which is unrelatedto diffusion and corrosion resistance of the carbon support. A typicalloss behavior is shown.</TEXT></DOC>
