Richard Gephardt, who employed aggressive televisionadvertising in his winning campaign.   Among the Republicans, network exit polls said, conservativevoters helped Pat Robertson challenge Vice President George Bushfor second place, while Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas won with broadsupport.   A third of the Democratic voters told CBS News they made uptheir minds in the last three days of the race, and 45 percent ofthem backed Gephardt, compared to 23 percent for Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis. Gephardt had trumpeted a key endorsement andattacked Dukakis in television advertising.   Gephardt and Dukakis, who finished second, split the liberalvote. But Gephardt won the moderate and conservative Democrats, wonthe male vote while splitting the female vote with Dukakis, and wonamong the less wealthy and the less educated, again splitting theothers with Dukakis, the polls suggested.   Surprisingly, the NBC News poll found that a plurality of SouthDakota Democrats, 46 percent, said they believed Dukakis eventualywill win the presidential nomination, even though not all voted forhim.   On the Republican side, Bush's identification with PresidentReagan failed to help his cause, the same problem Bush suffered inthe Iowa caucuses Feb. 8, the polls indicated. Bush finished thirdin Iowa to Dole and Robertson.   Dole won the Republican primary, Bush and Robertson were lockedin a race that was too close to call and Rep. Jack Kemp was adistant fourth.   Gephardt won the Democratic race, Dukakis was running second andthe remaining candidates were tightly bunched well back.   Dole campaigned determinedly in South Dakota, while Bush steeredclear of the state. The exit polls indicated that Dole won stronglyin nearly all categories; ABC News, for example, found that Dolewon more than seven in 10 liberals and moderates and four in 10conservatives.   Robertson was second among conservatives, with 27 percent inABC's poll, according to network poll analyst Doug Muzzio. Kemp waswell back, with 8 percent of conservatives.   CBS said Robertson, a former television evangelist, won supportfrom 51 percent of evangelical Christians, who made up about afifth of the Republican electorate.   Republicans who support President Reagan helped Bush win the NewHampshire primary. But in South Dakota nearly half of theRepublicans who favor Reagan _ 56 percent of the total _ went forDole, ABC found. About a quarter each backed Bush and Robertson.   Among the losing Democrats, NBC found that former Sen. Gary Hartof Colorado, who won the state in his 1984 bid for the nomination,was viewed unfavorably this year by twice as many South Dakotans asviewed him favorably. Roughly 60 percent said they were not pleasedthat Hart re-entered the race after withdrawing last summer amidquestions about his marital fidelity.   The CBS survey had a margin of sample error of 4 percent; ABC'swas 5 percent and NBC's was 3 percent. The networks did not poll inMinnesota, which held precinct caucuses Tuesday rather thanprimaries.</TEXT></DOC>
