The disclosure followed a report in The Wall StreetJournal that said Microsoft was, in effect, abandoning OS/2and putting Windows in its place.</LP><TEXT>   In an interview yesterday, Steve Ballmer, who runsMicrosoft's system software division, said that the companyplans to keep on marketing products under the OS/2 moniker,and that its future operating systems will support programstailored to OS/2's original specifications. But programswritten for Windows won't run on International BusinessMachine Corp.'s version of OS/2, which uses a command systemcalled Presentation Manager. This divergence strikes manyobservers as an abandonment of future OS/2 development,further distancing Microsoft from IBM.   But Mr. Ballmer emphasized that Windows software wouldwork with future versions of OS/2 relying on PresentationManager. &quot;It's a bit of a chameleon,&quot; said Mr. Ballmer,referring to future versions.   Microsoft may be pledging to market OS/2 so as not to hurtIBM's investment. &quot;Microsoft is under enormous pressure torationalize {their message} from an industry standpoint,&quot;said Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens andamp; Co.&quot;They don't want to do disproportionate harm to IBM in theprocess.&quot;   Four years ago, Microsoft and IBM jointly announced thatthey would produce a new program to replace the functionperformed by DOS, which controls the basic operations of thePC. The two companies, which had worked together to establishDOS as a standard, called the new program OS/2 and toldmakers of applications to design their OS/2 products around aset of specifications called Presentation Manager.   But OS/2 never caught on with customers. Instead, Windowswon the hearts of customers, who are pressing Microsoft foran iron-clad assurance that today's Windows' applicationswill work with the company's future operating system.   Mr. Ballmer acknowledged that Microsoft's future operatingsystem is no longer solely made up of OS/2 and PresentationManager, but will include &quot;subsystems&quot; that make itimpossible for customers to tell it apart from Windows. Healso confirmed that recently he has told designers of newapplications to &quot;target new development at {the} Windows&quot;subsystem.   However, under Microsoft's revised approach, operatingsystems are like invisible sentries, maintaining the basicoperations of a computer with little apparent trace. &quot;Fromthe developers and users standpoint, then, the operatingsystem is irrelevant,&quot; Mr. Rogers, the analyst, said. &quot;It'sWindows where everyone has the assets. Microsoft does too.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
