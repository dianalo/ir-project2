Becausethe now available phased-array electronics has 24 channels, the testsstarted with a single ring, which is divided into 24 segments. The experimentsshowed, however, that despite the high amplification reserve of the probe,no sufficient failure detection was possible because of occurring dimensionaldata. Within the framework of re-development phase, the probe was modified:instead of a single ring, a double ring system was chosen, which is dividedin 48 elements. The symmetry of the probe was used for the electricalconnection of two individual oscillators. Thus, the sound beam can beelectronically rotated; a change of the angle of squint is, for the present,only possible by mechanical movement. Experiments at the spherical bottomof the large container of the materials testing institute were carriedout with this probe. The indications of most of the test reflectors,placed in the perforated zones, distinguished very clearly from the platingnoise background and could be easily distinguished from the indicationscaused by the bore surfaces. A determination of the size of failuresby detection of peak indications in form of sector-B images and compound-Bimages proved to be very problematic.</TEXT></DOC>
