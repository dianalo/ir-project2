The offer comes amid warnings from GM that the $4 billionthe company pledged to guarantee jobs or income to its300,000 United Auto Workers employees last fall could run outbefore the three-year pact between GM and the UAW expires in1993, union officials said. A GM spokesman acknowledged thatexhausting the job security fund is &quot;certainly a possibility&quot;if the company's U.S. car and truck sales don't improve bynext year.</LP><TEXT>   GM already has spent nearly $500 million since Septemberto pay supplemental unemployment benefits to laid-offworkers. And the pace of spending is likely to accelerate asmore workers run out of state unemployment benefits, and thusstart collecting more money from GM.   UAW officials said GM and union officials have tentativelyagreed to a special early retirement plan that would payworkers with 28 years of seniority 85% of their gross wagesto retire. Those benefits would continue until the workersreach the end of their 30th year of employment, when theirnormal retirement benefits would kick in.   GM officials declined to confirm the agreement, but theydid say that GM and the UAW set the broad parameters for suchan arrangement in September when they entered their currentlabor pact. Details of the pact came to light after a meetingin which top UAW officials informed leaders from some 150 UAWlocal units that represent GM workers across the nation. UAWofficials said the final details of the agreement have yet tobe worked out.   According to union sources, the plan would be offered onlyto currently laid-off workers at locations that now have highnumbers of people laid off that the company isn't likely tocall back to work. Many of these workers could exhaust theirsupplemental unemployment benefits before they're eligible toretire.   It's not clear how many of the 39,600 GM workers currentlyon long-term layoff would be eligible for the proposed earlyretirement offers. Sean McAlinden, a labor economist at theUniversity of Michigan, said such offers are less successfulin recessions, when people generally feel insecure about theeconomy. Moreover, many of the eligible employees are intheir mid-50s, and thus as much as 10 years away fromcollecting Social Security benefits.   But GM, which is gushing red ink as it wrestles with theworst auto recession in nine years, clearly is hoping theoffer will ease the pressure on its cash reserves. Byshifting more workers into the company pension plan, GM couldreduce the drain on the $4 billion job-security fund, whichis financed from operations. GM had a loss of $1.6 billion inthe fourth quarter of 1990, the largest quarterly loss fromoperations ever for an auto maker. And GM could have an evenbigger loss in the current quarter, analysts say.   While GM hasn't provided specific figures for the cost oflast fall's labor contract, analysts say GM clearlyunderestimated the impact of offering job guarantees thateffectively made labor a fixed cost in the U.S. When thedouble-whammy of a weak economy and consumer anxiety over thePersian Gulf crisis sent car sales skidding last fall, GMfound itself paying thousands of workers to stay home asfactories shut down because of slow sales.   Modifying the UAW contract agreement to encourage moreearly retirements is just one of several steps the auto makeris taking to cut costs.   GM also is working with union officials to reduce thenumber of UAW members employed in jobs that aren't directlyrelated to vehicle production. Many of these workers areassigned to jobs that study quality, health, and safetyissues. In some plants there are hundreds of these jobs,which have been used as a form of patronage for loyal UAWmembers.   The UAW, however, isn't alone in making sacrifices to helpGM regain profitability. In February, GM cut its quarterlycommon stock dividend 47% to 40 cents a share, and alsoordered many of its suppliers to immediately cut their pricesby 3%. GM also is moving to slash 15,000 salaried jobs fromits North American payrolls and plans to trim capitalspending by $500 million a year in the 1991-1994 period.   Yesterday, GM's stock closed at $37.25, down 12.5 cents,in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
