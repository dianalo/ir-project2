Regulators helped healthy thrifts acquire four troubled thrifts on the last day of the year. The latest mergers raised the 1987 total of rescued or liquidated thrifts to 48. This year, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board plans to close ailing thrifts at a rate of one per week.    On Thursday, the FSLIC helped Alabama Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Birmingham, Ala. acquire two Louisiana thrifts: First Financial Bank, FSB, New Orleans, and First Federal Savings Bank, Slidell.    First Financial had nine branches and $748.2 million in assets. First Federal held $46.6 million in assets and had three offices. The FSLIC expects its aid to facilitate the two transactions will total $185 million. Before its acquisitions, Alabama Federal had 37 branches and $1.2 billion in assets.    In Illinois, regulators helped Champion Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Bloomington, take over troubled Gibson Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Gibson City. Gibson Federal had $138.5 million in assets and 12 offices in central Illinois. Champion Federal's assets total about $2.2 billion.    And in Virginia, troubled American Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Lynchburg, was acquired by First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Roanoke. American Federal's 11 offices were scheduled to open today as branches of First Federal. To promote the transaction, FSLIC contributed cash and other incentives worth about $35 million.    FSLIC had installed new management at American Federal in June 1986, in an effort to stem its deteriorating portfolio. The thrift had about $200 million in assets at the time of the merger. Before the acquisition, First Federal had 15 offices and assets totalling $504 million. </TEXT></DOC>
