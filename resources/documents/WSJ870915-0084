Robert Abboud, the former Chicago banker leading the restructuring of First City Bancorp. of Texas, secured a bonus pay plan for himself and his management team that could initially earn them more than $16.6 million.    Under terms of a complex capital restructuring plan announced last week by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Mr. Abboud and at least four other executives he has yet to select could earn stock warrants to purchase as many as 667,000 shares of First City common stock based on the profit of the banking company over a five-year period.    The FDIC-approved plan calls for the shares to be offered to the public later this year at $25 each, giving the warrants an indicated value initially of about $16.7 million, and possibly more if the stock market views the company as a hot turnaround prospect. If Mr. Abboud and his lieutenants manage to halt the losses at Houston-based First City, and make it profitable, he and the others would be entitled to exercise the warrants for just 7.5 cents a share, or a total $50,025, an intitial gain valued at about $16.6 million.    &quot;It's a very significant carrot for coming into a difficult turnaround situation,&quot; said an official close to the transaction. L. William Seidman, FDIC chairman, said &quot;We reviewed the package and thought it was fair.&quot; He declined, however, to disclose any details of the stock incentive plan.    If Mr. Abboud doesn't manage to turn a profit at First City within five years, he and his management team won't earn the warrants, officials said.    Such stock-for-performance incentives plans are rare in FDIC bank restructurings, analysts say, but they are commonly used to recruit new managers to try to reverse the fortunes of unprofitable corporations. Lee A. Iacocca, one of industry's most prominent examples, received options to purchase Chrysler Corp. stock when he joined the troubled Detroit auto maker in 1978. Last year, as previously reported, Mr. Iacocca earned a total of about $20.6 million in salary, bonuses and proceeds from exercising stock options and other stock incentives.    The number of warrants the Abboud team would be able to exercise hasn't been set yet, officials close to the transaction said. Nor have profit goals been established on which the warrants would be earned. Generally, to earn the right to exercise the warrants, the bank must meet income goals over a five-year span. The warrants would be exercisable over a 10-year period, officials added.    What's more, the First City bailout plan could give Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., the New York investment bankers that advised Mr. Abboud, as much as $50 million in stock warrants and fees, depending on several factors. As previously reported, Donaldson Lufkin plans to be the lead underwriter for a public offering of First City common and preferred shares totaling at least $500 million.    On top of more than $25 million in cash fees for its role as the underwriter, the FDIC agreed to allow Donaldson Lufkin warrants to immediately purchase one million First City shares, also for 7.5 cents each. That would give the firm the right to purchase $25 million of First City stock for $75,000 on the first day of the stock sale. But it is understood that Donaldson Lufkin currently plans to hold the First City warrants as an investment.    Lawrence Lavine, a Donaldson Lufkin senior vice president, declined to comment on terms of the transaction, as did a spokesman for First City. Yesterday, First City's common stock fell 12.5 cents to $1.125 a share, a record low, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled 1,250,600 shares.    The $500 million common and preferred stock offering is part of a previously reported bailout plan totaling nearly $1.5 billion, including a $970 million note to First City from the FDIC. The size of the FDIC's aid, which could become the second costliest in U.S. banking history after the 1984 bailout of Continental Illinois Corp., reflects First City's mounting losses stemming from bad real estate and energy loans and the company's shrinking capital base. The transaction, which requires shareholder approval and concession from its debtholders, is expected to be completed by year end.    Mr. Abboud has said that he plans to invest $5 million of his own funds to purchase part of the First City stock offering. Those shares would be held in addition to anything the 58-year-old banker might earn under the stock incentive plan he worked out with the FDIC. Also, the FDIC approved the payment of as much as $3.5 million to Mr. Abboud to reimburse him for legal, accounting and other expenses that he expects to incur to complete the transaction. It isn't known what other salary and perquisites Mr. Abboud will receive when he becomes chairman and chief executive officer of First City, which had $12.2 billion in assets at June 30, making it Texas's fourth-largest banking company. </TEXT></DOC>
