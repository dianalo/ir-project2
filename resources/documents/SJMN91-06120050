Pitcher Trevor Wilson was sent to Triple-A Phoenix in a majorpostgame move, and Craig, with an obvious push from an incensed GeneralManager Al Rosen, told the players to either change or be changed.;    Twoveteran players said it was the &quot;hottest&quot; they have seen Craig. Therecertainly was sufficient reason for it. The Giants bobbled balls, pitchedpoorly and continued to strand runner after runner, becoming the first team tolose to Gross (1-3) in either an exhibition or regular-season game since hesigned with the Dodgers.;    &quot;Most of the media are complaining about ourpitching, but it's everything,&quot; Craig said. &quot;You look at (Jose) Uribe and(Robby) Thompson, who are among the best in the league -- how many times arethey gonna (mess) up balls like that?;    &quot;You can take it for what it'sworth, what you saw, because you won't be looking at it no more.&quot;;    TheGiants, who went 1-3 on the first leg of this long trip, left for Philadelphiaand begin a two-game series Tuesday. Rosen said he would wait until today toannounce a replacement on the pitching staff for Wilson, who has been erratic.Left-hander Mark Thurmond, who helped ease the middle-relief woes last seasonand was re-signed to a Triple-A contract earlier this month, is eligible to becalled up as of Wednesday, but Rosen said he wants someone immediately, evenif just to fill a roster spot.;    Scott Garrelts and Rick Reuschel can beactivated after this trip, so it would be a stop-gap move barring a majordecision.;    Rosen, whose huge off-season deals brought added pressure tosucceed, had been pacing enough at Dodger Stadium. This must have worn out hisshoes. The Dodgers batted around in the first inning, for the second time inthree days. Uribe and Thompson made errors in that inning, no help to losingpitcher John Burkett (2-2).;    The Dodgers scored three runs in the inning,which is nothing new. In all, Giants opponents have scored 17 runs (16 earned)in the first inning, with 25 hits, 10 walks, three homers and a .341 average.;   The Dodgers added an additional run in each of the third and fourthinnings, the latter rubbing yet another grain of salt into the Giants' wound.It was a solo homer by castoff Brett Butler, a quick answer to Willie McGee'shomer in the top of the inning. Butler was 10 for 18 in the series.;   Although the Giants scored two runs off Jay Howell in the eighth on RBIssingles by Thompson and Matt Williams, and although they had two hits in theninth, they have not shown the heart of a team capable of coming back. TheGiants are 0-11 when trailing after seven innings.;    &quot;Our overall game rightnow stinks,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;Everything. Too many mistakes defensively, nothitting the ball like we're supposed to, making mental mistakes. You name it,we're doing it.&quot;;    Thompson said the postgame diatribe &quot;was good. It's whatwe needed. The overall package just isn't what it should be.&quot;; ETC.: Uribe canill-afford his recent mediocrity in the field. He went 0 for 2 and is hitting.091 (2 for 22). Mike Benjamin, who was sent to Triple-A to make room forUribe on the roster, had gone 1 for 21 at the start of the season.; HOW THEYSCORED;    Dodgers 1st -- With one out, Samuel singled and stole second.Strawberry singled, scoring Samuel.
