Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TAXES GOVMT </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's top thrift regulator predicted that Congress will extend a key tax benefit for acquirers of failed thrifts that currently is set to expire at the end of this year.    M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said he expects Congress will extend the tax benefits provision for at least six months and perhaps for as long as three years.    Mr. Wall's prediction came in answer to a question at a standing-room-only conference here, sponsored by regulators, intended to explain how insolvent thrifts can be acquired with federal assistance.    In other remarks to the conference, Mr. Wall said the Bank Board is likely to announce transactions this week involving six insolvent thrifts in two states outside Texas, and perhaps additional transactions involving failed Texas thrifts.    Mr. Wall also said the Bank Board has received bids that meet its minimum requirements for 14 of the 20 thrifts involved in the regulators' fast-track case resolution program, which began in June. Mr. Wall said the first of the transactions under that program, dubbed the &quot;McDeal&quot; program by some industry officials, could be completed next week.    The issue of extending the tax benefits is important to the Bank Board, because such tax benefits can be used to reduce the amount of assistance that must be provided by the already insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to acquirers of insolvent thrifts.    So far, the Bank Board has failed to get an extension of the tax benefits included in legislation moving through the House of Representatives; Bank Board officials previously said they viewed the issue as an uphill battle in the Senate. Mr. Wall, a former Republican staff director of the Senate Banking Committee, didn't say why he believes Congress will extend the tax benefits.    Under current law, any assistance provided to the acquirer of a failed thrift by the FSLIC, an arm of the Bank Board, is exempt from federal taxes. However, that exemption only applies to assisted acquisitions that are closed by Dec. 31. Mr. Wall's remarks indicated that he expects the deadline for transactions to qualify for the tax exemption will be extended from six months to three years, which would give the Bank Board more time to arrange acquisitions of the hundreds of insolvent thrifts in its backlog.    &quot;We are very optimistic that we'll see an extension of the tax-exempt status of FSLIC assistance,&quot; Mr. Wall said.    In addressing other aspects of the FSLIC caseload, Mr. Wall said the agency has begun the bidding process on 100 thrifts outside of Texas, and is working on resolving 100 failed thrifts in Texas.    Mr. Wall said the Bank Board is pleased with the response to its fast-track resolution program, in which it has promised to complete assisted deals within roughly one month after accepting a bid. He said the Bank Board plans to offer another round of failed thrifts under the fast-track program in September.    On a more sensitive issue for the Bank Board, Mr. Wall said he believes the federal government won't allow the FSLIC to default on any of its obligations, including notes issued by FSLIC to acquirers of failed thrifts. If such a default occurred, he said, &quot;There would be a significant loss of confidence in any government assurance program,&quot; such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and federal agencies that insure credit union deposits and pension benefits.    The accounting profession has raised questions about how notes from the FSLIC should be treated on corporate balance sheets in view of the agency's insolvency.    Mr. Wall also tried to head off expected criticism of the slow pace at which the Bank Board has worked in the past. &quot;I assure you that the process (of acquiring a thrift with FSLIC assistance) will be faster than you've heard about from those who have gone before you,&quot; he said.    A later speaker on the program, Stephen T. McLin, who heads a group that recently acquired an insolvent California thrift, said, &quot;The first gripe (about acquiring failed thrifts) is that it takes a long time -- and it does.&quot; Mr. McLin pointed out, however, that other agencies, such as the Federal Reserve Board, also sometimes move slowly in ruling on proposed acquisitions, even if they don't involve assistance. &quot;FSLIC isn't the only guy on the block who takes some time to get things done,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
