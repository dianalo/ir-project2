The Kansas City, Mo., bakery company said the lawsuit was filed Monday in Delaware Chancery Court by Max Rosman and Rodney B. Shields on behalf of shareholders. Ray Sandy Sutton, Interstate's vice president and general counsel, said, &quot;We have not been able to identify the plaintiffs as shareholders.&quot; Neither Messrs. Rosman and Shields nor their attorney could be reached for comment. Interstate said it believes the lawsuit is without merit.    The complaint charges that the proposed buy-out is &quot;grossly inadequate and unfair&quot; and claims management breached its fiduciary duty to holders. The buy-out is being led by Robert W. Hatch, Interstate's president and chief executive officer, along with 47 other company executives.    As previously reported, the management group proposes to pay $36 in cash and $4.50 in preferred stock for each of Interstate's 9.1 million common shares outstanding. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Interstate shares closed at $39.25, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
