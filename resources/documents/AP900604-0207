Thomas ``Tommy Karate'' Pitera, a 35-year-old martial arts expertin the Bonanno crime family, headed a gang of killers and drugdealers who dismembered their victims, stuffed them into suitcasesand plastic bags and buried them in a Staten Island bird sanctuary,the authorities said.   Federal authorities accused the defendants of at least sevenmurders in the last three years and said they might be responsiblefor about two dozen more.   A raid of Pitera's Brooklyn apartment yielded a library ofunderground publications with such titles as ``The Hitman'sHandbook'' and ``Kill or Be Killed.''   Law enforcement authorities say Pitera carried out the 1988assassination of Wilfred ``Willie Boy'' Johnson, who died in abarrage of gunfire outside his Brooklyn home.   The ex-boxer, gambler, loanshark and longtime associate ofGotti's crew, reportedly turned informant in 1966 and provided reamsof information to law enforcement authorities over the years underthe code name Wahoo.   ``Mr. Pitera believed he was doing a favor for John Gotti withthe extermination of Willie Boy Johnson,'' said Andrew J. Maloney,U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.   Pitera apparently carried out the hit to increase his prestigeand standing within the Bonanno family, the prosecutor said.   Pitera was arrested Sunday. The others were picked up on Sundayand Monday.   The defendants were charged with numerous racketeering and drugcharges and face life in prison if convicted.   Pitera and his associates allegedly dealt in large quantities ofcocaine, marijuana and heroin. They often arranged drugtransactions, but instead ripped off the suppliers ``and left thebodies behind,'' Maloney said.</TEXT></DOC>
