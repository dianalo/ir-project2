About 80 people were injured on the French island of Guadeloupeand 4,000 were left homeless, French officials said.   The region's most powerful storm in a decade was expected to plowinto Puerto Rico early Monday. The government mobilized the NationalGuard, and residents rushed for last-minute supplies and taped andboarded windows.   At 3 a.m. EDT Monday, Hugo's center was located near latitude17.6 degrees north and longitude 64.7 west, about 105 mileseast-southeast of San Juan, said the National Weather Service inFlorida.   The storm slowed slightly from 12 mph to 9 mph, the WeatherService said. The Virgin Islands' population is 106,000, and PuertoRico has 3.3 million people.   Hurricane-force winds of nearly 100 mph ripped away roofs andknocked out power on St. Thomas and St. Croix, about 70 miles eastof Puerto Rico, officials said. Those two islands have most of theVirgin Islands' population.   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted wereheavily damaged and there were reports of looting.   National Guard Adjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 peoplewere evacuated to rescue shelters in St. Croix.   Jesse Moore, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center inFlorida, said it was too early to tell if the storm ``will even hitthe United States (mainland). The closest we can forecast it is tobe off the southeastern Bahamas by Wednesday. After that it'sanybody's guess.''   The storm caused widespread damage early Sunday as it passed nearGuadeloupe. Damage also was reported on the islands of Martinique,Antigua and Dominica.   Guadeloupe state radio said five people were killed on thatisland. In Paris, French officials said up to five people had beenkilled there. Neither report gave further details.   Gabrielle Carabin, mayor of the village of Le Moule on thenorthwestern coast of Guadeloupe, said in an interview on theisland's Radio Caraibe Internationale that two village residentswere killed. She did not elaborate.   Beacon Radio in Anguilla said one person was killed in Montserratand two in Antigua, but it gave no details.   In the central Puerto Rican town of Utuado, a man waselectrocuted when he touched a power line while removing atelevision antenna from his roof to prepare for the storm, policesaid. He was identified as Antonio Alago Gonzalez, 51.   In San Juan, the Port Authority announced that it closed theMunoz Marin International Airport to all flights at 6 p.m. It saidall international carriers had removed their planes from Puerto Ricoexcept for one American Airlines A300 left behind for emergencies.   The Port Authority also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive inSan Juan had been routed to other destinations.   A Sunday morning weather service bulletin said: ``If the eye ofHurricane Hugo moves across Puerto Rico as forecast, we expect a50-mile wide path of extensive to extreme damage to occur.''   In Washington, Brian Ruberry, a spokesman for the American RedCross, said late Sunday that based on projections, the storm couldleave up to 250,000 people homeless on Puerto Rico.   Civil defense officials said up to 15,000 people could beevacuated from flood-prone areas of western Puerto Rico and hundredshad already been moved into a sports stadium in Mayaguez, theisland's third largest city.   National Guardsmen and volunteers drove through San Juan, thecapital, on Sunday issuing emergency instructions over loudspeakers.   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon flew over the island by helicopterSunday morning and told reporters later: ``We are as prepared as wecould be.''   In a statement on the emergency broadcasting system, the governorsaid waves 15 to 20 feet high were expected. He appealed to coastalresidents not living in sturdy homes to move to shelters in hundredsof churches, schools and other public buildings.   Reports indicated that the island of Guadeloupe, the mostsoutherly of the Leeward Islands, was the hardest hit of the stringof islands forming a 600-mile arc from the Leewards to the GreaterAntilles.   Jocelyne Vandvurdenghe, a French government official inMartinique, said 80 people were reported injured in Guadeloupe.   Hugo slammed into Guadeloupe, which has a population of 337,000,shortly after midnight, downing power lines and blacking out theisland's 30,700 telephones, state radio and television and and telexservice.   Officials said many houses and buildings were damaged. The eye ofthe storm passed over St. Francois, a major tourist area on theeastern end of the island.   The mayor of the village of St. Francois, Ernest Moutoussamy,said on Radio Caraibe Internationale that ``There's nothing left ofSt. Francois.''   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''he said, adding that several tourist hotels, notably the Meridien,suffered serious damage.   In Paris, a plane was sent Sunday with 60 rescue workers andemergency supplies for Guadeloupe, and two more were standing bywaiting for Caribbean airports to reopen.   Catholic Air announced in Paris it was sending clothes, water,food, and blankets in coordination with the Red Cross.   Louis Le Pensec, French minister of overseas terrotories, told anews conference that his government will provide quick disasterrelief funds to those who lost property.   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a hurricanein 1956 when Hurricane Betsy caused extensive damage.   Hugo is the fourth hurricane and the eighth named storm of theAtlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.   Forecasters said Hugo was the most powerful storm to hit theregion since Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated1,200 people in the Caribbean and Florida.</TEXT></DOC>
