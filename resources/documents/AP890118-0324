Ltd. andCarling O'Keefe announced Wednesday they're joining forces to createa new super-company capable of tapping the vast U.S. beer market.   The new company, an equal partnership between Molson and Carlingparent Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia, will be called Molson Breweriesand will have combined sales of about $2.3 billion, Marshall Cohen,president and chief executive officer of Molson, told a newsconference.   He said the venture will control slightly more than half theCanadian market while ranking as the sixth-largest brewer in NorthAmerica and the 20th largest in the world.   ``This North American partnership ensures Canada has a positionin the highly competitive world beer market,'' Cohen said. ``We wantto penetrate the North American market and increase our exportsconsiderably.''   Analysts described that objective as elusive, given the intensejockeying for market share south of the border.   In Canada, Carling and Molson together employ about 7,000 peopleat 17 breweries.   Executives of the new company will meet over the next 10 days todevelop a $200 million, 2-year strategy for ``rationalizing'' theseoperations that will mean the creation of large, modern plantscomparable to those in the United States.   Plant closings _ possibly one per Canadian province _ and layoffswill inevitably result, although about half the jobs lost will bethrough attrition and early retirement, said John Elliott, Elderschairman and chief executive officer.   ``The Canadian brewing industry is one of the most inefficient inthe world,'' Elliott said. ``There is not one plant in Canada thatis up to the minimum efficiency requirements to compete against theUnited States.''   Molson and Carling together currently export to the United Statesabout 15 million cases of beer a year, an amount they hope toincrease to 40 million, Cohen said.</TEXT></DOC>
