(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mild weather and curiosityabout the damage from last summer's fires helped YellowstoneNational Park set an attendance record in October, officials say.   Attendance in October increased by almost 50,000 people, or morethan 39 percent, compared to the same month last year, the park saidin a statement Thursday.   Fires blackened more than a third of the 2.2 million-acre parkand closed most of its major tourist areas during the summer.   The park said 175,019 people visited the park in October,compared to a total of 125,597, which had been the previous recordfor October. In the last 10 years, an average of 100,500 peoplevisited the park in the tenth month.   ``Park officials attribute the significant increase in Octobervisitation to warm weather and the many visitors wishing to view thepark after the fires,'' the release said.   The October figures bring the number of people to visit the parkduring its summer season, May 1 to Oct. 31, to almost 2.07 million,a 16.05 percent decline from 1987. The summer attendance record,2.47 million, was set in 1978.   The 1988 summer attendance represented only a 5 percent declinefrom the 10-year average of almost 2.17 million, said Robert Barbee,park superintendent.</TEXT></DOC>
