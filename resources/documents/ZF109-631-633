(The Interop report) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Van Name, Mark L.; Catchings, Bill.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Needs assessment is vital in all major hardware selections, suchas businesses buying local area network (LAN) equipment such asfile servers.andP;  A selection among the three main types of fileservers should meet the particular needs and uses of the companyor unit.andP;  The three types are 'big PCs,' 'smart disks,' and 'smartI/O' systems.andP;  Big PCs are microcomputers dedicated to file serveruse and enhanced with extra power, bus slots and drive bays.andO;These are often adequate for small networks of fewer than 25users.andP;  The drawback is that they are designed for fastsingle-user processing, not multi-user throughput.andP;  Smart disksystems such as Compaq's Systempro improve on big PCs with fasterthroughput and other network control features.andP;  Smart I/O systemsinclude both intelligent disks and intelligent network adapters.andO;They can handle hundreds of users despite the drawbacks ofproprietary systems.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Hardware SelectionFile ServersUser Needs.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that it's important toconsider your future needs when buying a computer.andP;  Even so, it's easy toignore the future under the pressure of today's bottom line.andM;That kind of shortsightedness can be particularly expensive over the longhaul if you're buying a LAN server.andP;  Three groups of servers are emergingtoday, and it's important to match the type of server you buy with yourfuture needs.andM;Every computer vendor in the world seems to be going into the serverbusiness.andP;  The popular theory is that all you need to make a server is adecent-sized case and power supply, a few EISA or MCA slots, and a few drivebays.andP;  We call such servers &quot;big PCs,&quot; and if your network will only have acouple dozen users, such a server will do nicely.andM;The problem with big-PC servers is that they typically are designed formaximum single-user response time, not maximum multiuser throughput.andP;  Checkout, for example, the performance of the ALR and Dell servers in PC Week'srecent File-Server Shoot-Out (Nov.andP;  12, Page 129).andP;  Both systems were greatwith one user, but their performances degraded rapidly as the number of usersgrew.andM;The second class of servers -- the &quot;smart-disk&quot; group -- offer betterthroughput by providing intelligent disk subsystems.andP;  Rather than using thesame old ESDI disks, these servers typically come with SCSI disks andintelligent, bus-mastering SCSI controllers.andP;  The disk subsystems alsousually offer such important extras as mirroring and striping.andM;Compaq's Systempro is probably the best-known member of this group, but manymanufacturers of big-PC servers are coming out with their own smart-disksubsystems.andP;  If the Systempro's performance in PC Week's Shoot-Out is anyindication, servers in this group will be able to handle networks of ahundred or so users.andM;We call the third group of servers the &quot;smart I/O&quot; bunch, because they addintelligence not only to their disk subsystems, but also to their networkadapters.andP;  These systems attack each I/O source with a separate processor, atactic that mainframes have employed for years.andM;NetFrame and Tricord are two of the most notable firms with servers in thisgroup.andP;  The stellar performance of NetFrame's NF-400 in the Shoot-Out showsthat smart-I/O servers have the potential to handle hundreds of users withreasonable performance.andP;  They also, however, have several potentialweaknesses.andM;One possible problem area is that these servers, by definition, typically usesome new -- and occasionally proprietary -- subsystems.andP;  Not all new designspan out.andP;  Perhaps more important, it can take quite a while for a vendor tolearn how best to apply new technologies.andP;  And, of course, proprietarytechnologies are often much more expensive than standard ones.andM;NetFrame, for example, was the huge performance winner in the Shoot-Out, butit was also by far the most expensive system, and it has a proprietary bus.andO;Tricord entered a server that fared no better than the Systempro, yet costs agreat deal more.andM;We suspect that Tricord could have greatly improved its showing by adding asecond I/O processor to its server, but the fact that it didn't indicatesthat it still has a lot to learn about its own machine.andP;  NetFrame might havebeen able to cut costs without losing much performance, but again, that kindof detailed configuration takes experience.andM;Servers also differ in the number of expansion slots they offer and in themaximum amounts of RAM and disk storage they can hold -- each of which isimportant for a large network.andP;  Eight slots might sound like a lot, but stickin a few disk controllers and three or four Ethernet boards, and suddenlyyou're out of room.andP;  The same goes for memory: A 32M-byte maximum is morethan enough for almost all lone users, but try it with a hundred usersbanging on a database server and you'll beg for more.andP;  Similarly, a diskmaximum of a gigabyte or two is enough for most networks today, but it won'tbe in the future.andM;We're not saying that big-PC servers are bad, or that smart-disk or smart-I/Oservers are for everyone; many networks will work well with small servers.andO;Some networks, however, will not, and the key is to know which kind you'll berunning a year or two down the road.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
