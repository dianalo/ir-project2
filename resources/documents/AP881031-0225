President Reagan denied interfering with efforts to freeAnderson, and his chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, denounced thetape as ``a cynical attempt'' to influence the Nov. 8 election.   Copies of the 2-minute, 35-second tape were delivered to twoWestern news agencies in Beirut four days after Anderson, 41,marked his fourth birthday in captivity.   Statements from the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, which holdsAnderson, accompanied the tapes.   ``On the occasion of Terry Anderson's birthday and in responseto your letters, and according to his desire to send you a recordedmessage, we hereby enclose with this statement the recorded messageon videotape,'' the kidnappers said.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, began the message by identifying himself and saying the datewas Oct. 30.   ``Once again I'm being given a chance to speak to my family, tomy friends and to the American people,'' he said.   Anderson said his spirits were boosted by the birthday greetingshe received, ``But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and asthe end of my fourth year (in captivity) approaches, I find itdifficult to keep my hopes and my courage high.''   ``I've been very close to being released several times over thepast two years. But each time it seems that the U.S. governmentuses its influence to stop any agreement from being made. And Idon't understand this.''   In Los Angeles, Reagan told reporters his administration haddone everything possible to win the hostages' freedom. ``I don'tthink that was Terry speaking,'' he said. ``I think he had a scriptthat was given to him.''   When asked about the statement on the tape that the U.S.government interfered when the hostages were about to be released,Reagan said, ``That is absolutely not true, but let me pointsomething out. Terry Anderson in that terrible confinement at thehands of those barbarians _ any information he has has to have comefrom there; there is no contact with the outside world.''   ``We have been doing everything we can for the release of thehostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to letthem go,'' the president said.   Anderson said, ``I gather there's been very little discussionabout this problem in the U.S. presidential campaign and that'sdisappointing, as is President Reagan's complete failure to find asolution during his eight years in office.   ``But whichever candidate wins this election, remember anunyielding refusal to deal with this matter is not going to make itgo away. It is not going to free us.''   He urged the next president to use his influence ``in a positiveway, not a negative one,'' to end his plight.   Of the two candidates, Anderson singled out Vice PresidentGeorge Bush.   ``I'm not asking President Reagan to deal with terrorists,although both he and Mr. Bush did so in the Iran-Contra affair andthe TWA hijack,'' the message said.   Bush has not been named previously as a negotiator in the 1985jet hijacking, in which Shiite Moslems demanding freedom for Shiiteprisoners held 39 Americans for 17 days and killed a U.S. Navydiver.   The vice president has minimized his role in the sale of arms toIran. The deal became known as the Iran-Contra affair when it wasrevealed that money for the arms was funneled to Contra rebels inNicaragua.   Fitzwater said the comments about Bush were ``totally incorrect,wrong.''   Anderson appeared from the waist up. He was dressed in a graytrack suit and read the statement in a steady voice. He was shaven,his hair was combed, and he wore glasses. He said he was beingtreated well.   It was the third videotaped message from Anderson released bythe Islamic Jihad, which kidnapped Anderson on March 16, 1985. Heis the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages. Nine are Americans.   The previous two messages were released Oct. 3, 1986 and Dec.24, 1987.   In addition to Anderson, Islamic Jihad holds Thomas Sutherland,56, of Fort Collins, Colo. He was acting dean of agriculture at TheAmerican University of Beirut when he was kidnapped June 19, 1985.   Islamic Jihad has freed three American hostages in the lastthree years _the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister; theRev. Martin Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest; and DavidJacobsen, former director of the American University Hospital inBeirut.   Jacobsen's release on Nov. 2, 1986, was linked to the U.S. armssales to Iran.   ``Our problem could have been solved long ago without suchcomplications as arms deals,'' Anderson said in his message.   ``I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts tofree three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanksto the Soviet Union for its help. It is a warming story,'' he said.``That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary tobring this situation to an end.''   The tape ended with a message to his family: ``Peg, Madeleine,Dad, kiss my daughters for me. Keep your spirits up and I will tryto do the same, and one day soon, God willing, this will end.''   Anderson has two daughters, Gabrielle, 13, and Sulome, 3. Thereference to ``Dad'' indicated Anderson does not know his fatherdied in 1986.   ``Peg'' referred to his sister, Peggy Say, and ``Madeleine'' isMadeleine Basil, the mother of Sulome.   Mrs. Say, in Batavia, N.Y. on Monday, said she continues hopingfor Anderson's release, but has given up criticizing federal policyagainst conceding to her brother's kidnappers.   ``You come to a place where you understand that when a horsedies you get off it,'' she said. ``The hostages are not a greatenough number to excite the masses.''   But ``if there were a plane load of Americans,'' she asked,``would we allow our president to not lift a finger?''</TEXT></DOC>
