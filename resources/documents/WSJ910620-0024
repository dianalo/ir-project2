Of the most competitive newly developed industrializedcountries, Singapore and Hong Kong head the list. South Koreamoved up to third place, supplanting Taiwan, which fell toNo. 4 in that category of the report, based on 330 criteria,by IMD of Lausanne, Switzerland, and the World Economic Forumof Geneva.   Japan led in domestic economic strength,internationalization, finance, management, science andtechnology, and worker qualifications. It has the world'shighest manufacturing productivity, the report said, citingworkers' receptivity to automation. The U.S. got top marksfor business freedom, transportation, natural resources andinformation systems. Germany ranked third, though unificationcosts could strain its competitiveness. Switzerland slippedto fourth place from second, on higher inflation anddiminished potential to attract foreign capital. Canadaremained No. 5.   Austria jumped to sixth place from No. 11 for its economicstability and role as a gateway to Eastern Europe.                                                                                                          THIRD WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AID                                                                                                          Developing nations said the industrialized world has aduty to give them money and technology for environmentalprotection with no strings attached. A declaration by the 41nations at the Ministerial Conference of Developing Countrieson Environment and Development in Beijing maintained that theWest was mainly responsible for pollution.                                                                                                          SWISS GET TOUGH ON TRUCKS                                                                                                          Switzerland said it won't offer further concessions in itsdispute with the European Community over how many trucksshould be allowed to cross the country. The issue is a majorobstacle to an agreement between the EC and the seven-memberEuropean Free Trade Association on creating a market of 380million people in a European Economic Area composed of bothgroups. Austria, also an important north-south road linkthrough the Alps, backs the Swiss.                                                                                                          PACE OF SOUTH KOREAN MEDICINE                                                                                                          South Korean doctors spend an average of two minutes and19 seconds with each patient, a survey of 1,330 clinics by aconsumer alliance found. Each physician treated an average of155 patients in a six-hour workday, and in 22 of the clinicstreated more than 350 -- about one a minute. On average,pediatricians saw 223 patients a day, dermatologists 180 andinternists 166.                                                                                                          ROMANIAN STRIKES WIND DOWN                                                                                                          Rail workers in Romania resumed work, as national laborunrest wound down. Strikers at Bucharest's Faurheavy-machinery plant, with 13,000 employees, agreed tosuspend their two-week-old work stoppage for 10 days whilethe government investigates alleged management misconduct.About 20,000 doctors and thousands of teachers remained onstrike, demanding increases in pay and government health andeducation budgets. The National Confederation of Unionscalled off a general strike.                                                                                                          WOMEN'S ROLE OPENING HUNGARY                                                                                                          Women are cutting Hungary's path to a free market. Beforethe revolution, women in the relatively open nation wereallowed to travel in the West more than men. Leading thetourism business, they had opportunities to study languages,economics and trade. And they were guaranteed sexual equalityunder communism.   Hungary is more advanced in establishing privateenterprise than its eastern neighbors, and has far morefemale managers. &quot;Now, when finance is becoming a hotprofession, you find more women&quot; in top posts, said ZsuzsannaRanki, co-founder and former director of the InternationalManagement Center in Budapest, the first business school inEastern Europe. Women tend to dominate in commerce andfinance, but are less evident in manufacturing and computerscience.   Ilona Zsidai opened the popular Cafe Pierrot nine yearsago, when entrepreneurship was an adventure in a hostileclimate. &quot;My style of management wasn't Hungarian,&quot; she said.She paid attention to detail and created a comfortableatmosphere, a decidedly different approach from the socialistethic. Ildiko Takacs helped set up the U.S. advertisingagency Young andamp; Rubicam's Budapest office. Now several of thepeople she trained are rivals in top jobs at other firms.   Still, many Hungarian women said they lack an equal chanceof being promoted to the highest ranks.

The London-based Middle East Broadcasting Center, whichdescribed itself as the first independent Arab televisionchannel, is preparing to launch satellite transmissionswithin a few months and plans to broadcast nine hours dailyfor Arabs in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. . . .The Soviet army, after a 47-year occupation, completed itswithdrawal from Hungary, the first of the former CommunistEastern European countries to secure freedom from Moscow'smilitary presence since World War II.</TEXT></DOC>
