TWA violated a Labor Department regulation when, after itfired the employees, it refused to notify them immediately oftheir eligibility for preferred hiring status by otherairlines, the court said.</LP><TEXT>   The notification, known as a &quot;designated rights letter,&quot;was an administrative vehicle used by the department toimplement the Employee Protection Program of the AirlineDeregulation Act of 1978. The employee-protection provided bythe act expired in 1988.   With the letter, employees could have receivedpreferential treatment over other candidates for jobs withother airline companies. TWA didn't send the notificationletter until February 1987.   Each flight attendant will seek an average of two years'back pay, to cover the period from May 17, 1986 -- when theyended the strike and offered to return to work -- till theywere rehired by TWA.   The Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming alower court ruling that found TWA liable, remanded the caseto the trial court for a hearing on damages.   An attorney for TWA, which is based in Mount Kisco, N.Y.,said the company was reviewing the decision.   ---   PARENT INDUSTRIES pleads guilty to racketeering in weaponscase.   Parent Industries Inc., a holding company owned by JamesH. Guerin, filed the plea in federal court in Philadelphiayesterday, a month after federal prosecutors charged that thecompany participated in a scheme to create more than $1billion in phony weapons contracts.   Mr. Guerin, who has not been charged with a crime, was thecreator of International Signal andamp; Control Corp., a globalweapons conglomerate based in Lancaster, Pa., that he startedin 1971 as a backyard industry.   Parent, the holding company for all of Mr. Guerin'sassets, pleaded guilty to padding and falsifying weaponscontracts to inflate the value of International Signal andamp;Control prior to its sale in 1987 to Ferranti InternationalPLC, Britain's third-largest defense contractor, for $670million.   Under the terms of the agreement, Parent will forfeit atleast $4 million and pay an additional $2.4 million in fines.Mr. Guerin remains under investigation.   In a plea memorandum filed by federal prosecutors, Mr.Guerin is alleged to have &quot;directed the financial fraud.&quot; Hisattorney in Philadelphia, Joseph A. Tate, said Mr. Guerin andParent are cooperating with prosecutors.   ---   DENTISTS ARE CONVICTED in unusual price-fixing case.   Three dentists were convicted in Tucson, Ariz., on chargesof conspiring to raise and fix fee amounts paid by theirpatients, the Justice Department said. The case involved thefirst criminal antitrust indictments and convictions ofmedical practitioners in 50 years, according to Robert Bloch,the prosecutor who supervised the case.   The government in recent years has focused increasedattention on alleged antitrust violations in health care.Previous cases have involved civil infractions related tosuch things as hospital mergers. More criminal charges couldemerge from federal grand jury investigations under way inBoston and in Savannah, Ga.   The dentists in the Tucson case were found guilty ofconspiring to raise &quot;co-payment&quot; fees charged to members offour prepaid dental plans. Co-payments are the extra amountsthat plan members must pay for certain non-routineprocedures, such as root-canal work.   Convicted Sept. 20 in Tucson were Aaron Alston, RonaldWalker and Richard Meyer. The dentists couldn't be reachedfor comment. Stephen Weiss, Dr. Alston's lawyer, said amotion has been filed requesting the judge to reverse thejury's verdict &quot;for lack of sufficient evidence.&quot; If themotion is rejected, as typically happens, the three dentists&quot;in all likelihood would appeal,&quot; the lawyer added.   Mr. Bloch said that the three men convicted were thecentral figures in a conspiracy involving more than 30dentists and affecting 80,000 dental-plan members. The pricecollusion began as early as May 1987 and continued untilFebruary of this year, according to the government.   The defendants face possible prison terms of as much asthree years each, as well as individual fines of hundreds ofthousands of dollars. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 17.   ---   FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION official passes through revolvingdoor.
