And the report describes theapplication of a power plant barge forming a part of an oceanic pasturesystem. There are such many problems as high cost, long time requiredfor the transportation of fuel and maintenance of equipment, etc. tosecure energy offsore distant from the coast. Nevertheless, the solarpower supply system is quite promising as an independent offshore powersource in the future, notwithstanding the high cost at present. Sincethe solar cell may be flooded with saline water, the panel is designedto have the inclination of about 2.3 degrees so as the saline water flowsdown automatically, and the solar cell panels are arranged in radialdirections so that the stable power is obtainable.
