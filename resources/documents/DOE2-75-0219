In astronomicalapplications, the readout allows for qualitatively different observationmodes (e.g. staring or slow drift scanning) which are particularly wellsuited for space observations and for the use of arrays. In many applicationsthe new readout can also increase sensitivity. We present noise spectra{sup 4}He temperature bolometers with no excess noise at frequenciesgreater than 0.1 Hz. The optical responsivity of a bolometer operatedwith the new readout is measured to be the same as that of the bolometeroperated with a conventional readout. 12 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
