At alltime points following the aerosol-stimulation of the mice with wholeEscherichia-coli-055:B5, the thymus-independent anti Escherichia-colilipopolysaccharide (LPS) response was significantly suppressed in thespleen. In the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) the immune response to LPSwas enhanced at 9 weeks, followed by a depression. When the silicon damagedlungs were bypassed using an intravenous injection of the antigen theresponse was not noted. Histological examination of silicotic lesionsindicated silica laden aggregations or dust cells at 24, 33, 36, and39 weeks. The presence of silica dust in the lungs was confirmed usingenergy dispersive x-ray analysis, which also identified submicroscopicsilica particles in the spleen. The lungs and MLNs demonstrated granulomatousand fibrotic changes at 39 weeks. Aerosol-immunized lungs demonstratedperivascular and peribronchiolar lymphocytic cuffing. The bronchiolesof silica exposed animals contained a greater number of macrophages.Infiltration of macrophages was noted adjacent to blood vessels and respiratoryairways on scanning electron microscopy examination.</TEXT></DOC>
