Cove Capital Associates Inc., which represents Air Wis shareholder Transmark USA Inc., stopped short of making a specific bid, but said it is willing to discuss an offer that tops any previous bids the company has received.    Transmark filed a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, saying it was considering seeking a controlling interest in the Appleton, Wis., company, among other options. In a recent letter to Air Wis management, Cove Capital said Transmark believes &quot;it is time to focus more intensely&quot; on the option to seek control.    Transmark, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based investment firm, and its president Mark C. Sanford, hold a combined stake equivalent to 9.9% of the company's common shares outstanding. Cove Capital described its overtures as &quot;friendly&quot; and said it &quot;anticipates working as partners&quot; with Air Wis management.    William H. Geenen, the airline's vice president for finance, said the company's directors haven't yet decided on a response to the letter. Air Wis is the holding company for Air Wisconsin, a regional carrier that feeds traffic to Chicago-based UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.    Trading was halted yesterday on the company's shares pending the announcement, then resumed as the stock jumped $2.50 to close at $15.625 a share in national over-the-counter trading.    This is the second time in six months Air Wis has been a potential takeover target. In May, AW Acquiring Corp., a group which included Air Wis' former chairman, offered to buy the company for $126 million, or $17 a share, in cash and debentures. Air Wis rejected the offer and AW agreed to refrain from further takeover efforts for three years.    Mr. Geenen said the $17-a-share offer from AW was the highest the company had ever received. Cove Capital apparently is prepared to top that price, Mr. Geenen said.    Although Cove Capital described its proposal as friendly, its letter clearly puts pressure on Air Wis management. The letter notes that nearly a quarter of Air Wis's shares have changed hands in the past six weeks and 100% of the shares have traded since March. &quot;These new shareholders . . . will not accept credible acquisition proposals to be lightly rebuffed,&quot; the group said in the letter. </TEXT></DOC>
