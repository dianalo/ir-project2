Democrat Michael Dukakis' prescription for cracking down oncrime includes tougher gun controls, including waiting periods forhandgun purchases.   A provision calling for the handgun waiting period waseliminated Thursday in the House from a bill calling for amulti-billion dollar increase in the federal war on drugs. TheHouse already voted overwhelmingly last week in favor of a Bushcampaign promise to seek the death penalty for drug killers.   Bush opposed the so-called Brady amendment to the drug billwhich would have required a federal waiting period. The NationalRifle Association waged a pitched battle against it.   Bush, a lifetime NRA member, told the National Association ofPolice Organizations in a recent survey: ``I am opposed to federalwaiting period legislation; as I have stated in the past, this is amatter for the states to decide.''   Twenty-two states have laws requiring waiting periods. The Houseamendment is being pushed by Sarah Brady, wife of White House presssecretary James Brady, who was one of four people shot during JohnHinckley's March 1981 attempt to assassinate President Reagan.   Mrs. Brady's lobbying group, Handgun Control Inc., wants aseven-day wait on handgun purchases from licensed dealers.   Under the amendment, a dealer would have to send law enforcementauthorities a sworn statement including the gun's serial number anddescription and the buyer's name, address and birth date. Thepolice, at their option, could perform a background check.   Dukakis told the police organizations: ``I support legislationthat allows law enforcement officials adequate time to review thecriminal record or competency of anyone applying for a handgunpermit.''   Dukakis' record in support of gun control, including a proposedban on cheap ``Saturday Night Specials'' used in many streetrobberies, has angered gun owners in his home state ofMassachusetts. Signs at the state's borders call attention to itsmandatory prison sentences for illegally carrying a gun.   Dukakis says government should respect the right of citizens touse firearms for hunting and target shooting, and ``to own firearmsto protect their homes and businesses, subject to the regulation ofstate and local governments.''   But the governor says ``there are too many illegally ownedhandguns across this nation, and we must act strongly to controlthe use of handguns by criminals.'' He says homicides committedwith handguns claim 22,000 lives each year.   Bush, in his campaign literature, says, ``I have always opposedfederal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.'' But he addsthat ``we must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners withthe rights of society. ... We must do all we can to keep guns outof the hands of convicted criminals.''   In a debate with other Republican candidates before the GunOwners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2, Bush said, ``I'm not only ahunter but I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. I do have a deepappreciation for the Second Amendment rights'' to keep and beararms.   He assured the gun owners he would, as president, veto a billdrafted by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would banundetectable plastic handguns as a security hazard, but he urgedgun owners to work with police organizations to fashion acompromise.   ``I'm making a pitch here for reason on the part of hunters,''Bush said. ``The last thing you want to do is find yourself opposedby those that are on the cutting edge of fighting narcotics,fighting against international terror and trying to protectinternational safety.''   A compromise later was reached on the plastic gun issue. TheHouse and Senate passed separate but similar measures, now awaitingfinal action in a conference committee. Both candidates say theysupport restrictions on undetectable firearms.   Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen, in an example of his manypolicy differences with the top of the ticket, opposes anationally-mandated waiting period for handgun purchases. ``Ibelieve it ought to be done on a state-by-state basis,'' the Texassenator said Thursday.   Bush's No. 2, Sen. Dan Quayle, also opposes legislation thatwould mandate the waiting period on the national level.   Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, toldreporters last month that letting states decide on waiting periods``fails to recognize the immediate danger to our police posed bythe drug gangs.''   Williams said Bush ``has taken a position that is diametricallyopposed to the interest of law enforcement.''   ``We are particularly concerned because Vice President Bush hasattempted to make law enforcement issues a central plank in hisplatform. ... '' said Williams. ``Bush cannot equivocate or standwith both the police and the NRA on this one.''</TEXT></DOC>
