BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Personal computers have proved adept at mastering two of the Three R's -- 'riting and 'rithmetic. But reading has posed problems for them. Scanners that can read printed text and enter it into a computer have been either expensive or limited.    Next week, however, a tiny Silicon Valley firm will introduce a new reader that appears to provide a price breakthrough in reading technology. Closely held TransImage Corp.'s $2,600 hand-held reader can be swept along a line of text in a book or magazine and instantly turn it into computer code for editing, altering or inserting into letters or manuals.    TransImage, a four-year-old Sunnyvale, Calif., firm backed by $7.9 million in venture capital, said its TransImage 1000 is a &quot;keyboard alternative that enters text directly into software applications&quot; on a personal computer.    The device can read thousands of different fonts, or type styles, and can switch from one to another without stopping; so, a writer could copy one paragraph from a magazine, then a page from a book and add in a story from a newspaper. It can be instructed to recognize unfamiliar shapes such as trademarks or even the Cyrillic alphabet used in Russia and some other Slavic countries. Frederick Snow, president of TransImage, said a user can copy a page about four times faster than a good typist.    James Cavouto, editor of MicroPublisher Report, a Torrance, Calif., newsletter, said the TransImage 1000 &quot;appears to be a breakthrough in text reading capabilities at that price.&quot;    There are now readers on the market costing under $1,500 that attach to personal computers. But they can read only a few typewriter fonts because they rely on exactly matching the shape of a letter to a pattern stored in the reader's memory. The varied sizes and spacings of typeset text baffle such readers.    The TransImage is an omnifont reader that perceives letters as shapes. One of the lowest-priced existing omnifont readers is the $9,950 Discover, made by Kurzweil Computer Products Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., subsidiary of Xerox Corp. Howard N. Smith, president of Kurzweil, said, &quot;If (the TransImage) really is omnifont and trainable and costs under $5,000, that's impressive.&quot;    Mr. Snow said he thinks the hand-held model will be especially popular with business people who aren't professional typists. One early user, Roberta Canto, director of marketing training for Leland Wolf andamp; Associates, a Foster City., Calif., insurance-administration firm, said, &quot;I told them they underpriced it.&quot;    Ms. Canto has been compiling a 300-page training manual for health-insurance agents and borrowing books from libraries to develop a glossary. &quot;Since I'm choosing as I read it, I can scan it into the disk right away instead of marking up the book for a typist,&quot; she said.    The TransImage 1000 consists of a stapler-sized hand-held scanner on rollers with a tiny camera-lens at one end focused on the type. Information is passed through a wire to a circuit board installed in an IBM-compatible personal computer. Chips in the board translate the images of dark and light into letters.    TransImage said it will sell its reading technology to other companies that want to make scanners that automatically read whole sheets of paper. Unlike page scanners, the TransImage product can't cope with graphs or drawings. And, said Mr. Cavouto, the newsletter editor, &quot;You'd be surprised how fast your hand can get tired.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
