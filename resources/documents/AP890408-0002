Analysis of the unique genetic blueprint can be a powerful toolfor investigating and prosecuting violent crime, Van de Kamp saidFriday in support of legislation proposed by state Sen. Gary K.Hart.   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes ofcells, including saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bonemarrow. Only identical twins can have the same DNA pattern, orgenetic blueprint.   Under the bill, blood samples already required of sex criminalswould be taken also from people convicted of murder, assault orbattery. DNA analysis of the samples would be stored in acomputerized data base available to police.   The information could link a suspect to a crime in which tissueis left behind. Rape investigations, in particular, would benefitfrom the system, Van de Kamp said.   The state of Virginia will begin providing DNA testing for itspolice and sheriff's departments on May 1.</TEXT></DOC>
