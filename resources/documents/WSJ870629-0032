The nation's No. 2 aluminum producer charges in its suit that Columbia Gas and its affiliates -- Commonwealth Gas Services Inc., Commonwealth Gas Pipeline Corp., Commonwealth Gas Transmission Corp. and Columbia Gulf Transmission Co. -- violated antitrust laws by refusing to transport natural gas sold by independent producers to Reynolds's manufacturing plants in Virginia.    The complaint further states that Columbia Gas abused its monopoly power by forcing Reynolds to purchase natural gas exclusively from Columbia at prices that allegedly were higher than those offered by the independent producers. As a result, Reynolds said it suffered damages of more than $4.3 million between July 1983 and July 1986.    Reynolds maintains that under the antitrust statutes, it is entitled to triple damages of about $12.9 million, in addition to interest, costs and attorneys' fees.    A spokesman for Columbia Gas, based in Wilmington, Del., said the company is &quot;aware&quot; of the suit. He declined to comment further. </TEXT></DOC>
