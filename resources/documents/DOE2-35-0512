The degree of self-locking dependson the magnitude of the magnetic field and can reach a value of 100 percentat a fixed value of the magnetic field satisfying the condition 2(g)(beta)(H)= Delta, where Delta is the intermode interval and beta is the Bohr magneton.A nonuniform magnetic field leads to an additional broadening of thespectrum at the Raman frequency and a shortening of the ultrashort pulses.</TEXT></DOC>
