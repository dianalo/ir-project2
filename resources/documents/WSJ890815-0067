Foreign-exchange traders said many in the market expected a correction in the dollar. But when the U.S. currency failed to slip substantially, participants, fearful of being excluded from a sustained rally, snapped up the dollar.    Victor Polce, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Algemene Bank N.V. in New York, said Friday's rally caught the market off guard and left some major participants with short-dollar positions that needed covering. &quot;People are saying Friday came and went and, 'Hey, did you get that license plate,'&quot; Mr. Polce said.    The 0.9% rise in July retail sales reported Friday, above general expectations of a 0.7% increase, helped cement the growing impression that economic activity is strong enough to alleviate pressures on the U.S. Federal Reserve to extend a recent series of cuts in the federal funds rate, traders said. Federal funds are overnight loans of reserves among Fed member banks.    Combined with a 0.4% fall in the July producer price index Friday, retail-sales figures suggest the U.S. economy is on course for a much-touted &quot;soft landing&quot; -- where inflation declines but the economy musters continued growth.    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. Economic Advisors, said that without the threat of an imminent recession, there is no need for further Fed easing.    Writing in the firm's latest market commentary, Mr. Sinai said, &quot;With the economy now appearing on a 2%-plus track, the federal funds should hold at close to 9% for some time. Other short-term interest rates will adjust to this fulcrum.&quot;    Traders said the New York Fed was widely rumored to be selling dollars through a few discreet banks at a few points in the day. However, no one could confirm the reported actions. Traders said the effect was minimal.    In late afternoon New York trading yesterday, the dollar was at 1.9485 marks, up from 1.9405 marks late Friday, and at 141.95 yen, up from 141.85 yen. Sterling was at $1.5772, down from $1.5825.    In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened for trading at 142.40 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of about 141.90 yen.    Dealers were divided Monday over the near-term prospects for the dollar, with some expecting the June U.S. merchandise trade report, scheduled for release Thursday, to confirm the market's enthusiasm and push the dollar to near 1.97 marks.    However, Lou Rappaport, chief dealer at Societe Generale in New York, predicted the ebullience will fade as the week progresses. He said that after the dollar's sharp ascent, the market is too vulnerable to disappointment from economic data scheduled for release this week. Mr. Rappaport predicted the dollar will correct to 1.9250 marks by the end of the week.    The dollar held Friday's gains in Asian trading, staying in a narrow range between 1.9315 marks and 1.9425 marks. Dealers said repeated probes of dollar-buying interest near the lows uncovered active support, despite rumors of Bank of Japan intervention.    As European traders took over, activity diminished, partly because of holidays in some trading centers. The dollar remained in its established range through most of the European day, and traders reported that apprehension of a repetition of Friday's concerted central-bank intervention chilled dollar buyers. Nine Western European central banks, the New York Fed and the Bank of Canada sold dollars together to slow the currency's advance Friday.    When U.S. trading began, demand for the dollar livened up as participants who were waiting for a downward correction to buy the U.S. currency abandoned hopes for one.    The renewed interest pushed the dollar through an important technical level at 1.9450 marks in late afternoon New York trading, sparking a wave of stop-loss dollar buying that carried the U.S. currency to its intraday highs of 1.9515 marks and 142.18 yen in short order.    Traders said that of the major currencies, the yen had the smallest losses against the dollar, as Japan's currency continues to recover from a steep fall on recent political turmoil in that country.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.10 an ounce, up $1.90. Estimated volume was a light 2.1 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $364.45 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
