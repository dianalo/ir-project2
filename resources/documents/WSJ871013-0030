Chemical, a unit of Chemical New York Corp., will dismiss about 170 of its 950 employees in Britain, becoming the third major U.S. bank to cut London staff in recent weeks. American firms have expanded rapidly in London in the past few years, amid the deregulation of financial markets here. A year ago this month, American banks were among those scrambling to increase their staffs in anticipation of Big Bang, as the deregulation has come to be known. But tough competition and sluggish performance in some of those markets, especially bonds, now is prompting a shakeout.    Last month, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Co., dismissed 11% of its London staff and sharply cut its equity market-making. Just yesterday, Salomon Inc. announced that its Salomon Brothers Inc. unit will withdraw from the slumping municipal bond and money markets businesses -- areas that had helped make the firm a Wall Street giant -- and that it will lay off 800 people. Other American firms have been looking recently for ways to cut their overhead costs, which have escalated in the past 18 months.    However, a quick survey yesterday of other American firms here suggested additional mass firings aren't imminent. Officials at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Security Pacific Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said they don't plan layoffs in London. Officials of Chase Manhattan Corp. weren't available for comment.    In its restructuring, Chemical is significantly cutting back its London-based new-issues operations and securities-dealing operations. The British unit has been particularly buffeted by the current doldrums in the Eurobond market. London cutbacks at Chemical had been expected since last month, when the banking unit announced that it planned to eliminate about 2,100 jobs, or 10% of its work force, world-wide.    John Howland Jackson, Chemical's managing director in London, said the bank will cut nearly half its current 60 dealing-room posts. The cutbacks &quot;will trim it to a more manageable level,&quot; Mr. Jackson said in a phone interview. Roughly the same proportion of jobs will be dropped in the 150-person origination department of Chemical's commercial-banking and securities operations, he added.    Overall, a quarter of Chemical's London-based work force likely will be dismissed in the restructuring, which focuses on Chemical's securities, commercialbanking and administrative staffs. Roughly 5% of the employees at Chemical's 350-person operations center in Cardiff, Wales, also are being let go.    Mr. Jackson said the cuts reflected &quot;a significant de-emphasis&quot; of Chemical's role as an originator of Euromarket financings. &quot;There is a definite scaling-down of our ambitions in the primary markets,&quot; he said. &quot;Our commitment wasn't justified by current market conditions.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Chemical common shares closed at $36.75, up 37.5 cents.    Tough competition from Japanese and larger American houses put Chemical at No. 43 of 60 firms rated in last year's rankings of Eurobond houses. Chemical didn't even make it into the top 60 firms in rankings for the first nine months of 1987.    Mr. Jackson said Chemical still aims to bring new Eurobond issues to market, but &quot;it may not be all that many occasions in the coming year.&quot; Chemical instead will concentrate on secondary-market trading and sales, he went on, as well as on its profitable foreign-exchange and syndicated-loans operations. Those operations largely are unaffected by the restructuring.    Competitors said they had expected the reductions, given Chemical's spotty performance in the Euromarkets recently. Chemical &quot;had a pretty small operation anyway&quot; in London's Euromarkets, observed a Britain-based executive at another major American bank. </TEXT></DOC>
