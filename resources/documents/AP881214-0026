U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth said Tuesday the lawviolated the free speech rights of D.C. Council members.   ``We are thrilled and we feel vindicated,'' said MichaelGreenberger, a private attorney who represented the council members.   The law, known as the Armstrong Amendment for its sponsor, Sen.William Armstrong, R-Colo., imposed on City Council members``compelled speech'' that violated their First Amendment rightsunder the Constitution, the judge declared.   Under the provision, ``a majority of plaintiffs would be forcedto vote in favor of adopting the amendment, which presumablyrequires a vote of `yea' or `nay.' The court finds that this vote isof sufficient communicative value as to be protected by the FirstAmendment,'' Lamberth said.   ``Legislators do not generally leave their constitutional rightsat the statehouse gate, and the court does not see why FirstAmendment rights should be an exception,'' Lamberth wrote.   The case appears to be the first time Congress has attempted tobalance gay rights and religious freedom.   The amendment, which would have forced the city to amend itshuman rights code, was tacked onto the city's 1989 budget, alongwith several other measures which were opposed by the districtgovernment. Congress had threatened to freeze the city's $3.2billion budget on Jan. 1 if the council failed to change the law.   Armstrong had argued that the local law including gay rightsunder the human rights code, forced schools such as GeorgetownUniversity to go against its Roman Catholic tenets.   The council members, acting individually, claimed their oaths ofoffice required them to uphold the laws of the city and protectionsguaranteed by the Constitution. They argued that the congressionalorder to weaken the code was unconstitutional.   The council had been scheduled to modify the human rights code atits Tuesday night meeting.   Council Chairman David Clarke said at the Tuesday night meeting:``We hope the Congress will recognize the dignity of the council asa legislative body. We want to respect and work with the Congressbut there's a point beyond which we won't go.''   During a Friday hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Curtis Hall saidCongress' ultimate authority over the district government allowed itto force changes in city law.   The judge, however, rejected that argument.   ``That authority is not limitless,'' Lamberth said. ``Congressmay at any time exercise its authority as the legislature, but thatexercise of authority must be constitutional.''   Armstrong proposed the amendment after a dispute between gaystudent groups and Georgetown University. The D.C. Court of Appealsruled that Georgetown need not officially recognize the groups, butmust grant them the ``tangible benefits'' of recognition, includingstudent activity funds.   The university complied, saying it was satisfied with the ruling.Officials have said the university intends to follow the local law,despite Armstrong's efforts.</TEXT></DOC>
