That'scertainly what the Bush administration wants us to believe.In fact, the central problem with the treaty remains: TheSoviets still see arms control as a way to disarm the Westwithout having to disarm themselves. Despite the new Sovietrhetoric, the Soviets are exhibiting their same old behavior.   For the past two years, the Soviets have been ensuringthat half of their arsenal of conventional forces will beexempt from the terms of the treaty. Since 1989, the Sovietshave been moving armaments east of the Ural Mountains, wherethe treaty's terms will not apply. (The redirection of tensof thousands of trucks and railway cars from hauling produceto transferring arms was a principal cause of the desperateSoviet food shortages of the past two years.)</LP><TEXT>   As late as last May, the Soviets were conceding that theconventional arms treaty would apply to:   -- 31,990 tanks;   -- 49,300 armored combat vehicles;   -- 51,000 artillery pieces   -- 6,490 combat aircraft; and   -- 2,950 attack helicopters.   Now, however, the Soviets have radically reduced thenumber of weapons that will be subject to the treaty. West ofthe Urals, the Soviets now say they have deployed:   -- 20,694 tanks;   -- 29,348 armored combat vehicles;   -- 13,828 artillery pieces;   -- 6,445 combat aircraft; and   -- 1,330 attack helicopters.   As a result, instead of being obliged -- as they otherwisewould have been -- to scrap 18,840 tanks, they will have toget rid of just 7,544. They will have to eliminate 9,348armored combat vehicles, instead of 29,300; 653 artillerypieces instead of 37,825; and 1,295 combat aircraft insteadof 1,340. Rather than junk 1,450 attack helicopters, theywill actually be allowed to add an additional 170 to theirpresent force.   In addition, the Soviets are attempting to protect 5,000pieces of equipment from the treaty by imaginativelyredesignating three motor-rifle divisions as coast guard,naval infantry, civil defense and strategic rocket units.   The Soviet habit of undercounting their weapons makesthings even worse. U.S. intelligence estimates that therewere actually 7,000 more pieces of military equipment in thetreaty area in 1989 than the Soviets were willing to admitto.   As a result of the undercounting and the movement ofweapons eastward, altogether 70,085 pieces of heavy militaryequipment that would otherwise have been destroyed willescape the treaty to be stored in huge shelters across theUrals. The West cannot even console itself with the thoughtthat this equipment might be left outside to rust or betransferred to the Asian theaters.   As if this were not enough, the Soviets have also renegedon their informal commitment to submit a list of 1,756&quot;objects of verification&quot; -- the sites where their mainweapons are located. The actual number of sites they suppliedwas just 895, although according to NATO there are at least2,661.   These maneuvers have enabled the Soviets to nullify thetwo major goals of the treaty: To reduce the Soviet threat toEurope -- not just shift it eastward, and to establish arigorous verification regime.   The Soviets argue they are fully meeting their treatyobligations, because the treaty forbids withdrawal ofequipment only after it is signed. From a legalistic point ofview, they are of course right. But that only calls intoquestion why the West should have any interest in continuingwith this particular arms control process.   When the Soviets agreed to negotiate a conventional forcestreaty in January 1989, the West assumed it had found &quot;in theSoviet Union a new partner for arms control,&quot; in the words ofone member of the U.S. negotiating team. The West wasimpressed when Mikhail Gorbachev and several other Sovietspokesmen emphasized repeatedly before and during the talksthe need to destroy military equipment, rather than redeployit. After 15 years of fruitless squabbling during the Mutualand Balanced Force Reduction talks over exactly how manyweapons each side had, the West welcomed what seemed to be asincere Soviet intention to give up their numerical advantagein conventional weapons in Europe.   Western negotiaters agreed that the treaty would applyonly west of the Urals because they did not believe that theSoviets could pull out large amounts of equipment before thetreaty was concluded. In an interview given four monthsbefore the conclusion of the treaty, the chief Americannegotiater, James Woolsey, said he expected only &quot;somelimited amount&quot; of equipment to be withdrawn. There was goodreason to hope that a satisfactory agreement could be arrivedat.   But the Soviets had other ideas. Although the CIA hadinformed the Bush administration in late 1989 about massiveSoviet equipment withdrawals, the State Department decided toplay down this information, lest it encourage the Europeanallies' to demand the extension of the treaty area to thewhole Soviet Union. An extended treaty area would have madethe withdrawal of Soviet conventional armaments moredifficult, but would have also put limitations onconventional armaments in the U.S.   In essence, the West was blinded by Soviet promises ofcooperation. In spite of the tough stand the Bushadministration appears to be taking on the final aspects ofthe negotiation, it professes to remain unconcerned by theSoviets' actions. White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwatercontinues to proclaim that &quot;We're satisfied that {the SovietUnion} is complying with the treaty.&quot;   The administration has also backed down from its demandfor a full accounting of the whereabouts of Soviet equipmentbefore and after the signing of the treaty. While Mr. Woolseyhas characterized the pre-treaty withdrawal of Sovietequipment as &quot;fraud,&quot; Mr. Baker has glossed over it. In aDecember interview with the Financial Times, he said that theU.S. was unconcerned about the removal. To this day, theState Department still refuses to acknowledge the ongoingremoval of conventional weapons.   But this removal substantially reduces the value of thetreaty. The West should block its ratificiation until theSoviets destroy the conventional arms they removed, correcttheir &quot;object of verification&quot; numbers, and reduce othermilitary units to make up for the reclassified motor-rifledivisions. The Soviets should be reminded of the treatyclause that, if a treaty party increases treaty-limitedequipment outside the area to which the treaty applies insuch proportions so as to pose an obvious threat to thebalance of forces within the treaty zone, the signatories cansimply withdraw from it.   While the &quot;Charter of Paris for a New Europe,&quot; signed Nov.21, certified the Soviet political retreat from Europe, theConventional Forces in Europe Treaty failed to extract themilitary prize for winning the Cold War. Thanks to the usualarms control delusions besetting the West, this opportunityhas been missed.   ---   Mr. Kern is a research associate at Boston University'sCenter for Defense Journalism.</TEXT></DOC>
