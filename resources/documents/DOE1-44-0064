<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0064 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Hartree-Fock method is applied to find the energy of the ground stateof the helium atom enclosed in a spherical box with a finite potentialwall. The model is used to describe the increase of the electronic kineticenergy of helium gas at high pressures. For pressures less than 25 kbara small negative potential wall leads to significantly better agreementwith experimental results than the widely used hard-box model. An approximateform of a new boundary perturbation method is applied to the enclosedhelium atom and very good agreement with the SCF (self-consistent field)result is found up to pressures of the order of 1 Mbar.</TEXT></DOC>
