PUTNAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A reported U.S. plan to quell the Palestinianuprising in Israel's occupied territories is unacceptable because itcalls on the PLO to surrender its only weapon for swaying publicopinion, Palestinian leaders said.   At a Mideast peace symposium here, the Palestinians also urgedthe United States to back an independent state for their people aspart of a stepped-up international peace effort. They spoke on thesecond day of a three-day symposium at Columbia University.   Several left-wing Israeli legislators and prominent Jewishleaders attending the symposium predicted the reported U.S. planwould fail if it didn't offer a permanent solution for reconcilingthe demands of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.   The New York Times reported Sunday that the Bush administrationplans to propose that Israel and the PLO take steps to ease tensionin the Israeli-occupied territories.   U.S. officials plan to ask Israel to release some of thePalestinians arrested during the 15-month uprising, end or limitdetentions and reopen schools in the territories, the newspapersaid, quoting an unidentified senior administration official.   The U.S. initiatives also would call on the PLO to halt violentdemonstrations in the territories, block anti-Israeli raids fromsouthern Lebanon and stop distributing inflammatory leaflets, thenewspaper said.   ``These demands are unbalanced, unfair,'' said Faisal Husseini,director of the Arab Studies Center in East Jerusalem and aPalestinian leader in the occupied territories.   ``They are asking us to stop the demonstrations,'' he said of thereported U.S. proposals, while Israel was being asked ``theminimum.''   Nabil Shaath, chairman of the Political Committee of thePalestine National Council, said the United States first shouldendorse a separate Palestinian state as part of a peace plan.   ``Let's put the horse where it should be and the cart where itshould be, and the horse is the peace arrangement,'' said Shaath,whose council is the legislative arm of the PLO. ``What is notnegotiable is the final result, an independent Palestinian stateside by side with the state of Israel.''   David Susskind, vice president of the Jewish CoordinatingCommittee for Belgium, said Jews in Europe and the United Statesmust pressure Israeli leaders to accept a Palestinian state.   ``Israel needs the solidarity of the Jewish people,'' he said.   Yossi Sarid, a member of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movementin Israel's Knesset, or parliament, said the Bush proposals willfail if the administration plans only ``an interim agreement,''without addressing the final status between Israel and the PLO.   But a Jewish-American lawyer who met with PLO chairman YasserArafat in Sweden last year welcomed the reported U.S. plan and saidthe PLO still needs to show Israelis that it can make all itsfactions abide by its pledge last year to refrain from terrorism.   ``The biggest problem that is confronting the PLO at this pointfrom both the Israeli and American point of view is that it isn'tclear to those two parties ... that the PLO can control thesituation,'' said Rita Hauser, citing recent incursions by PLOguerrillas into Israel's self-declared security zone in southLebanon.   The new Bush proposals were to be presented today when IsraeliForeign Minister Moshe Arens meets with the president, the Timesreported, while the suggestions for the PLO were to be presentedthrough the American ambassador in Tunis, Robert Pelletreau Jr.</TEXT></DOC>
