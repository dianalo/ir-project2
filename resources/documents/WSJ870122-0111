Loss of the investment tax credit and changes in depreciation are making a dent in corporate spending programs, says Stanley Gault, chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers. &quot;Most people with heavy capital expenditures are reducing their former estimate levels,&quot; he says. But long-range improvement programs haven't come to a screeching halt because of the new tax law.    &quot;We can't just throw a switch and say we're not going to continue improvement programs,&quot; says a spokesman for Aluminum Co. of America. It will increase capital spending to $635 million from $558 million last year. Conceding that tax changes make improvements less appealing, Rome Strip Steel Co. President A. Buol Hinman says his Rome, N.Y., company nonetheless will spend $2 million on a new rolling mill, betting that modernization will pay off.    Many that are spending will do little hiring. Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co. budgets $225 million for improvements while holding the line on employment.    WALKING GEAR makes big strides as companies try to corner a new market.    &quot;Jogging, the boom of the late '60s and early '70s, has run its course&quot; due to injuries and an aging population, says Brad Ketchum, editor of Walking Magazine. He's seen circulation shoot to 500,000 from 365,000 in eight months. &quot;It's somewhat overwhelming,&quot; he says. Shoe manufacturers are jumping into walking. Rockport Co., a market pioneer, reports 40%-a-year sales growth. Timberland Footwear Inc. says its lightweight waterproof walker, introduced last spring, already accounts for 15% of sales.    But many predict a shakeout, saying there are too many shoes in a market that isn't yet defined. Shoe makers &quot;don't know whether to put an athletic look, a stylish look or a rugged outdoor look on it,&quot; says Robert Carr, editor of Sporting Goods News. Some hope the walking trend will create a market for accessories such as pedometers, walking sticks and rain gear. The Urban Hiker opens in New York, billing itself as the country's first walking store.    SOARING LEGAL COSTS prompt insurers to seek defense-coverage limits.    The National Association of Insurance Commissioners last month rejected an industry proposal to reduce insurers' payments in liability cases by the amount they spend on defense. &quot;We didn't want the insurer to shift the responsibility to the consumer,&quot; says Edward Muhl, NAIC president. But with 38 cents of every premium dollar now going for defense costs, the regulators say they might accept separate caps on defense costs in certain commercial policies.    &quot;It's going to be a coming battle for sure,&quot; says Robert McKay, a New York University law professor. One reason: Companies see such caps as undermining their ability to afford a proper defense. &quot;I don't see any reason why any company that is insured should be happy about this,&quot; says Charles Morgan, vice president and senior corporate counsel at Kraft Inc.    But if insurers can cut premiums drastically by imposing some kind of cap, companies may view it as an economic trade-off, Mr. Morgan says.    ARMCHAIR BIRD WATCHING: Two videotapes by MasterVision Inc. provide sights and sounds of birds along with animated range maps. For $74.95, birders can buy either &quot;Ducks Unlimited's VideoGuide to Waterfowl and Game Birds&quot; or the first in the Audubon Society's three-part video series on North American birds.    BUSINESS BOUNTY: Oregon City, Ore., promises to pay real-estate brokers cash bonuses of up to $5,000 for deals that bring new full-time jobs to the town. To date, the city has made four awards and gained 45 jobs.    A PET-FOOD TAX to provide funding for humane societies is proposed by John Kullberg, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He estimates a 5% tax would raise $300 million a year for animal programs.    CHICKEN WARS continue as restaurants keep expanding their menus.    The current shakeout in the fast-food industry may hit chicken chains hard, says Joan Lang of Restaurant Business magazine. &quot;Not everyone can continue to offer chicken nuggets and claim profits on that item.&quot; Burger and roast-beef operators find it easier to expand their menus without losing their identity. Arby's, for example, tests roast chicken, chicken salad and a chicken club sandwich in three markets, with the roast chicken accounting for as much as 10% of sales.    High chicken prices in 1986 hurt some operators, who either had to raise prices or reduce profit margins. &quot;I don't think anyone is arguing that Kentucky Fried Chicken or Church's are going to disappear, but they may be buying up some of the regional chains that don't have the bucks or budget to compete,&quot; says William Roenigk, a National Broiler Council economist.    Chicken consumption continues to rise, surpassing pork in 1986. The average person eats 59.9 pounds a year.    BRIEFS: Dancers who autograph their used toe shoes can trade them for a 25% discount on new shoes next week at Taffy's in New York. . . . Japanese brides spend $3,000 to $4,000 on their wedding garments, four times more than U.S. and European brides, says the Japan Bridal Consultant Association. </TEXT></DOC>
