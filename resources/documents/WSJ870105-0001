Yetnikoff, the colorful president of CBS Inc.'s record division, is growing restive under the new administration of acting chief executive officer Laurence A. Tisch, company sources said.    Mr. Yetnikoff's discontent stems from his failed attempt last month to lead a group in a purchase of CBS Records for $1.25 billion, and from Mr. Tisch's cost-cutting efforts, the sources said. Most associates doubt he is dissatisfied enough to quit his job. Nonetheless, analysts view his ties to major CBS recording artists, including singers Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen, as critical to the success of the unit, which is highly profitable.    Moreover, the recent tension has raised speculation that the division may be sold after all. Though CBS directors vetoed the idea last month, CBS officials don't rule out that Mr. Tisch eventually may push for the sale again -- particulary in the face of another attractive offer. They note that Mr. Tisch could present Mr. Yetnikoff's discontent as one reason to accept a bid.    Mr. Yetnikoff says he doesn't intend to leave CBS because of recent events. &quot;I've been disappointed before,&quot; he says, but &quot;not to this extent.&quot; He considers the sale of the record division a &quot;dead issue&quot; for now, but says, &quot;I'd love to own the (record) company.&quot; And if given the opportunity to participate in a buyout again, he says, &quot;If I'm asked to, I will.&quot;    Flamboyant and temperamental, Mr. Yetnikoff plays the role of maverick executive and often displays irreverence for authority. In an interview with Esquire magazine, for example, he once complained that former CBS chairman Thomas H. Wyman &quot;won't let me make any money.&quot; He's also well known for his theatrics -- at a recent CBS shareholders meeting, for example, he fell asleep at the dais, or pretended to.    But associates say the 52-year-old executive, who has been head of CBS Records since 1975, is unhappy about Mr. Tisch's efforts to streamline his unit. Mr. Tisch hired management consultants from the accounting firm of Coopers andamp; Lybrand to analyze all of CBS's operations for cost savings. The consultants, headed by Thomas C. Flanagan, currently are studying the record unit's operations after having helped cut hundreds of jobs from CBS's broadcast division.    Company sources say Mr. Yetnikoff has told Mr. Tisch that he believes the division already is operating efficiently. CBS's records unit went through a major restructuring in 1982 that resulted in the elimination of 2,000 jobs. Mr. Yetnikoff says he is cooperating with Mr. Flanagan. &quot;Things can always be done better. If he can show that to me, I'll change,&quot; the record executive says.    But associates say he isn't according Mr. Flanagan special treatment. In one story circulating at CBS corporate headquarters, Mr. Yetnikoff reportedly had the bodyguard of a friend attend a recent review session with Mr. Flanagan in a humorous effort to intimidate the consultant. When asked if there is any basis for the story, Mr. Yetnikoff says, &quot;Maybe and maybe not.&quot; But a CBS colleague notes that Mr. Yetnikoff uses such antics &quot;because he wants to make a point that sticks.&quot;    Associates say Mr. Yetnikoff was particularly upset at the CBS board's decision to hold on to the record division. Sony Corp. of Japan, Walt Disney Co. and a group led by Nelson Peltz, chairman and chief executive officer of Triangle Industries Inc., were all prepared to make serious offers for the unit in transactions that would have made Mr. Yetnikoff a part-owner of the division, sources close to the board say.    While Mr. Tisch is said to have favored the sale, directors, who weathered a 1985 hostile takeover attempt that might have dismembered the company, decided against the proposal. Mr. Yetnikoff was so irate at the board's decision he began berating directors, saying, among other things, that they should decide in what direction to steer CBS, sources say.    &quot;He got out of hand,&quot; says one source close to the board. An associate adds, &quot;His ego was bruised,&quot; for on the eve of the Dec. 10 board meeting, Mr. Yetnikoff thought the buyout &quot;was within his grasp.&quot;    What steps Mr. Yetnikoff will take next are unclear. He is in the third year of a five-year contract that pays him $475,000 annually, plus bonuses, and allows him to produce motion pictures. Some CBS officials attribute the recent incidents to his mercurial disposition and believe his dissatisfaction will pass, as it has in other instances. &quot;He's at sub-normal discontent levels&quot; at present, a colleague says. A CBS executive adds, &quot;He always likes to dramatize things.&quot;    But other CBS sources believe Mr. Yetnikoff's clash with the new CBS culture is just beginning. They note that Mr. Tisch is more of a hands-on manager than Mr. Wyman was and that he is as headstrong as Mr. Yetnikoff. &quot;He's finding that Tisch is not a pushover,&quot; a CBS official says.    Sources speculate that Mr. Yetnikoff may eventually try again to buy the division, which is expected to report record results for 1986 because of strong album sales. Or, at the least, threats to quit or continued discontent by Mr. Yetnikoff &quot;give Tisch a good reason&quot; to push for the sale should another bid arise, an official says. &quot;Nobody is going to buy the division without (Mr. Yetnikoff),&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
