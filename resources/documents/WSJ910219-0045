All of these factors, they say, might cause the FederalReserve to temporarily suspend its interest-rate reductioncampaign and adopt a wait-and-see approach.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Investors are having second thoughts about how fast theFed will ease&quot; credit policy, said Norman Robertson, chiefeconomist at Mellon Bank Corp. He said the Fed isn't likelyto reduce interest rates again until the second week in Marchat the earliest.   But if the Gulf war ends soon, the next reduction inshort-term interest rates may be put off until even later.Speculation that the war may soon be over emerged Friday,after Iraq's leader Saddam Hussein first mentioned thepossibility of a withdrawal from Kuwait.   &quot;Iraq's sudden offer to withdraw from Kuwait containedenough strings attached that most coalition members dismissedit immediately, but it is a harbinger of the completecapitulation that is coming in the near future,&quot; said CharlesLieberman, senior vice president at Manufacturers HanoverSecurities Inc.   Mr. Lieberman said that an end to hostilities couldprovide a mild stimulus to the economy by lifting consumerconfidence and encouraging consumer spending. He said hedoesn't believe that peace is enough to revive the economy,but such an event would make it less urgent for the Fed toreduce interest rates in the immediate future.   Even if war persists, some members of the Fed'spolicy-making Open Market Committee may want to see whetherthe recent rate cuts have begun to stimulate businessactivity before voting to reduce rates further.   &quot;There are reports that some members of the FOMC think theFed has done enough for now,&quot; said Mellon Bank's Mr.Robertson. Since July, the Fed has reduced the federal fundsrate, which applies to overnight loans between banks, by twopercentage points to a target level of 6 1/4%.   Mr. Robertson and many other analysts remain bullish onthe bond market's longterm prospects, expecting yields on thebenchmark 30-year Treasury bond to drift as low as 7 1/2% bymidyear, from just under 8% now. Yet they say bond prices mayfluctuate until investors see evidence that the Fed is readyto cut rates again.   Some investors had hoped the Fed would reduce the federalfunds rate last week after several crucial economic reports.But the reports weren't as weak as many expected, leading tospeculation that the Fed might wait until the March 8 releaseof the February employment report before making any decisionsabout monetary policy.   If the employment report does not show signs of aneconomic turnaround and money supply growth remains sluggish,the Fed will probably ease rates a notch, said Robert McGee,senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd. &quot;If money growthshows signs of picking up on a sustained basis, and otherleading indicators such as consumer confidence and the stockmarket are pointing higher, the Fed will probably be morecautious and wait,&quot; he adds.   The stock market's spectacular performance, meanwhile, isthe source of much confusion in the bond market.   In times of recession, bonds tend to outperform stocks.That's because a weak economy spurs the Fed to reduceinterest rates. A rate cut will increase the attractivenessand the price of older, higher-coupon bonds. At the sametime, stocks tend to do poorly as corporate profits declineand dividends shrink.   Because stock prices now are rising much faster than bondprices, some investors believe the recession is almost over,which might encourage investors to sell bonds and invest instocks.   This week, investors will get some clues as to how the Fedviews the economy when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan appearsbefore Congress to give his assessment of the state of theeconomy.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bond prices ended mixed with short-term securities postinglosses while longterm bonds posted gains.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/8 point, again of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The pricewas quoted late at 98 23/32 compared with 98 19/32 lateThursday. The issue's yield, which moves in the oppositedirection of its price, eased to 7.98% from 7.99%.   The latest two-year notes, however, fell 1/8 point to aprice of 100 10/32 from 100 14/32. The issue's yield rose to6.81% from 6.74%.   The benchmark bond soared about one point higher in earlytrading on reports that Iraq would pull out of Kuwait, onlyto retreat when the Iraqi offer was seen to entail conditionsthat would be unacceptable to the coalition forces.   In the junk bond market, prices ended moderately higher.Among the leading advancers were the 13.625% seniorsubordinated debentures of Bally Health andamp; Tennis Corp., whichjumped three points to 25 on speculation that the company hadmade an interest payment within its 30-day grace period,which expired Friday.   The Bally Manufacturing Corp. subsidiary did not make a$6.8 million interest payment on the debentures due Jan. 15.   Among the key losers in the high-yield market were junkbonds of USG Corp., which said it won't make $40 million ininterest payments due Friday on $600 million (redemptionvalue) of bonds. USG's 16% pay-in-kind bonds, for instance,shed three points to end at 12.</TEXT></DOC>
