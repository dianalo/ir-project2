U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen sided with union lawyers whoargued that the Interstate Commerce Commission violated the federalRailway Labor Act when it gave the green light to a BN subsidiary'splan to use the two-member crews.   The ICC had given the subsidiary, Winona Bridge Railway Co.,permission in November to reduce its crews on 1,860 miles of BNtrack between Seattle and Winona Junction, Minn.   Burlington Northern had planned a start-up operation betweenSeattle and Spokane, Wash., on May 31.   Aspen also denied a counter-petition from BN to block threateneda strike by the unions if the railroad went ahead with its plans.   The United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood ofLocomotive Engineers said creation of the two-member crews was anunlawful attempt to circumvent the provisions of collectivebargaining agreements.   Under current union contracts, Burlington must maintain a crewconsisting of an engineer, a conductor and one or two brakemen.   In an effort to reduce its operating costs to compete with othermotor and rail carriers, Burlington sought renegotiation of itsunion contracts to eliminate one brakeman from all crews and beginoperating ``expediter trains'' with one engineer and one conductor.   Last year, the UTU refused to go along with the request fortrains operating between and within Wisconsin and Washington.   But the ICC exempted the railroad from provisions of the RailwayLabor Act, which requires mandatory bargaining when there is aunilateral change in working rules and conditions.   Burlington Northern, however, went ahead with plans to implementthe two-member crews over the Winona route and the unionsthreatened to strike if the railroad began the operations. Lawsuitsfrom both sides followed.   ``We have no difficulty concluding that the dispute here betweenthe UTU and Burlington regarding working conditions on trains ...agreement is a major dispute subject to the mandatory bargainingand status quo provisions of the RLA,'' Aspen wrote.   The labor law, first enacted by Congress in 1926, sought toprevent crippling work stoppages that have plagued the railroadindustry, by forcing parties to resolve their differences throughbargaining.   Attorneys for BN and the union could not be reached Thursdaynight to comment on the ruling. The phone number for union lawyerJoe Prekop in Cleveland went unanswered, while a recorded messageanswered the telephone of BN attorney Roger Campbell.</TEXT></DOC>
