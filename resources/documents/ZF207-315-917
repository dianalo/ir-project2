(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bequai, August.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Hackers tend to think that they will receive very light sentencesor mild reprimands for their part in the release of computerviruses or worms.andP;  In fact, many areas of the country have asubstantial number of legal statutes on the books that can beapplied to cases of computer crime.andP;  Privacy statutes exist thatcover personal files, medical records, educational materials andprovide for the prosecution of those who violate that privacy.andO;Negligence laws make it clear that hackers are responsible fortheir actions whether or not they intend harm.andP;  Also, sincecomputer programming is a profession, programmers who writeviruses may be prosecuted under malpractice or breach of contractstatutes.andP;  The infringement of viruses on a firm's businessrelations and the culpability of accomplices in the writing ofviruses and worms are also discussed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer CrimesComputer VirusesProgrammingLegal Issues.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hackers, Beware: Legal Sanctions Are on the BooksandM;Destructive incursions by computer hackers are nothing new.andP;  One industrygroup recorded 300 &quot;events&quot; that affected more than 40,000 computers over aspan of less than one year.andP;  But hacking didn't make banner headlines untilCornell University student Robert Morris allegedly wrote a &quot;worm&quot; programthat brought thousands of government and private computer users to theirknees.andP;  (For another look at this subject, see &quot;Prevention Proves Best Curefor Computer Viruses,&quot; page 19.)andM;The media hoopla has died down, but the hackers are still out there, mostbelieving they'll receive no more than a slap on the wrist if they're caught.andO;No wonder, considering the number of trade press articles claiming thathackers get away with hacking because the legal system lets them.andP;  Whathackers don't realize is how many civil and criminal laws would apply to themif someone really wanted to crack down.andM;In this column, I'll look at some of the civil liabilities hackers face.andO;Next time, I'll examine criminal penalties for hacking.andM;Privacy.andP;  Although the U.S.andP;  Constitution doesn't go beyond safeguarding theprivacy of citizens from governmental intrusion, almost every state in theunion has some sort of broader privacy statute on its books.andP;  These lawscover personnel files, medical records, educational materials and much more.andM;They also provide for both civil and criminal sanctions against anyone whoalters, tampers or gains unauthorized access to files containing sensitivepersonal information.andM;The courts have done a good deal to protect individual privacy, too.andP;  Forinstance, they've deemed libel a form of privacy violation, and it doesn'tmatter whether false, libelous statements were written as a joke or with nointention of causing harm.andP;  By extension, a hacker who tampers with someone'sfiles and causes false statements to be released about that person could besued for libel.andM;Negligence.andP;  Hackers who inadvertently cause injury to others could findthemselves in hot water under negligence law.andP;  Absence of malice doesn'tmatter.andP;  Neither does the hacker's claim that he or she was merely conductingan &quot;experiment&quot; or exercising First Amendment rights (free speech, freeassociation, etc.).andP;  The courts have made it clear that we're all legallyliable for the consequences of our actions, even if we didn't set out tocause any harm.andM;Malpractice.andP;  What do doctors, lawyers and computer programmers have incommon?andP;  They are all professionals who can be sued for malpractice.andP;  Ifcomputer malpractice suits become more common, clever programmers might thinktwice about creating a virus &quot;just to see what would happen&quot;--particularly iftheir employers have to carry expensive malpractice insurance.andM;Breach of contract.andP;  In both the public and private sectors, a programmer isexpected to comply with his or her employer's practices--and employersgenerally frown on things like virus creation.andP;  Failure to live up toemployer guidelines could result in a breach-of-contract suit, whether theemployer's guidelines are detailed in a written contract or given verbally atthe time a programmer accepts an offer of employment.andM;Business relations.andP;  Anyone who interferes with another's business oreconomic dealings can be sued and is liable for losses.andP;  In other words, ahacker who infects, say, a banking system with a virus, might get stuck withthe tab for the bank's lost income.andP;  &quot;Business relations&quot; in this context cantake any form--a contract, pending agreement, employment relationship,services rendered.andM;&quot;Joint tortfeasors.&quot;andP;  This fancy legal term simply means everyone involved incommitting a wrongful act is accountable for the results of that act.andP;  Theparticipants don't have to sign their names in blood by moonlight; all that'snecessary is a tacit understanding.andP;  Thus, two programmers who develop avirus and send it out over a network are equally liable for the havoc itcauses.andM;Long-arm statutes.andP;  A California hacker who thinks he or she can't beprosecuted by a New York company is all wet.andP;  The New York company just needsto demonstrate that the hacker had some kind of contact with its localoffice; a computer log-in will probably do nicely.andP;  And if the company canprove that the California hacker accessed its New York system, it can use NewYork's long-arm statute to bring the hacker to trial in a New York court.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
