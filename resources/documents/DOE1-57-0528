Emphasis on risk and safety, as primarily technical issues, canpartly be seen as a strategy. Employed by power elites in the nucleartechnostructure, this diverts emphasis away from controversial and normativequestions regarding the political and social consequences of technologyto questions of technology that appear to be absolute to the technologyitself. Nuclear safety, which started from a preoccupation with riskrelated to the nuclear energy research and development process, is examinedusing the analytic concept of field. As a social arena patterned to achievespecific tasks, this field is dominated by a body of state engineersrecognized to have high-level scientific and administrative competences.It is structured by procedures and administrative hierarchies as wellas by technical rules, norms, and standards. These are formalized andrationalized through technical, economic, political, and social needs;over time; they consolidate the field into an institution. The studydocuments the nuclear-safety institution as an integral part of the nucleartechnostructure, which has historically used the specificity of its expertiseas a buffer against outside interference.</TEXT></DOC>
