Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at1.7100 marks, up from 1.7067 marks late Tuesday in New York.The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 138.15 yen, upfrom 136.15 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7225, off from$1.7325.   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 137.95yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 136.64 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.7052 marks, upfrom 1.6938 marks at Tokyo's close Wednesday.   The dollar moved higher after the National Association ofPurchasing Managers' survey for April and March's index ofleading economic indicators came in around marketexpectations.   Thin trading in Europe, due to the May Day holiday,exaggerated the currency's rebound.   &quot;The numbers today put a slight pause on the dollarselling,&quot; said John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealerat Algemene Bank in New York.   The purchasing managers' index was 42.1, compared with 40in March. Both levels, however, show the economy was indecline, as a reading below 50 tends to indicate themanufacturing economy is declining while a reading below 44suggests the overall economy is shrinking. Forecasts calledfor the number to be around 41.8. March leading indicatorsedged up 0.5%, short of expectations of a 0.8% rise, after a1.2% gain in February.   And despite its view that economic activity throughmid-April remained weak, &quot;there were some indications thatthe decline may be bottoming out,&quot; the Federal Reserve saidin its Beige Book report for the five weeks to April 22.   Yesterday several major U.S. banks lowered their primelending rates to 8 1/2% from 9% after their costs ofborrowing were reduced by the discount rate cut. The discountrate is the rate the Fed charges on loans to financialinstitutions.   After the U.S. unit lost 2.5% to the mark Tuesday, Asiandealers continued the push lower early Wednesday &quot;but theytry to sell it and it just doesn't go anywhere,&quot; said JoseGonzalez, manager of foreign exchange trading at NationalBank of Detroit.   Mr. Gonzalez said dollars were in demand ahead of theTreasury's announcement of its quarterly refunding. TheTreasury said late in the day that it will sell a record $37billion of new government securities next week, up from theprevious record of $34.5 billion in February.   When the Fed surprised the market Tuesday with the 0.5percentage-point cut in the discount rate to 5 1/2%, thedollar was already consolidating after rising nearly 24%against the mark since mid-February.   After the dollar slipped to an intraday low of 1.6850marks during Asian activity Wednesday, there was &quot;some degreeof bottom fishing,&quot; said Mr. Vullo. The first prime rate cutsprovided the momentum to bring the dollar back above 1.7000marks, said Mr. Vullo.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $356 an ounce, up 10 cents. Estimatedvolume was a light 1.3 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $355.45 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
