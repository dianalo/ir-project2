Police with shields hurled tear gas grenades when about 100students tried to force their way through police lines after arally at Yonsei University in Seoul. Hundreds of other studentscheered the marchers.   ``Execute Chun Doo-hwan!'' the students yelled as they attackedriot police with firebombs, rocks and iron and wooden clubs.   Hundreds of people out for Sunday walks ran from the flyingrocks and firebombs or cried and choked because of tear gas.   ``They should beat them. This is outrageous,'' complained amiddle-aged man in a suit as he ran for cover.   Police outnumbered the radicals and had few problems containingthem. The protest was smaller than most recent clashes have been.   Student leaders demanded that Chun and his successor, RohTae-woo, be punished for the bloody suppression of a 1980anti-government uprising in the southern city of Kwangju in whichnearly 200 people died, according to government figures. Chun andRoh were top generals at the time.   The unpopular former president stepped down in February afterheading an authoritarian government that suppressed opposition andimposed rigid controls for seven years.   Hundreds of police guarded Chun's house and roads leading to itin a residential area about one mile from Yonsei.   Two police vans, supported by scores of charging troopers, droveprotesters back with clouds of white tear gas pumped out bymachines.   Several police officers and protesters were injured by rocks andother missiles. Police did not report any arrests.   Police seized several boxes of firebombs from marchers thatofficers said were to be used in an attack on Chun's residence. Sixstudents were arrested June 16 when about 20 radicals withfirebombs tried to attack the former president's home.   Radical student leaders denounced Chun and Roh at a rally atYonsei before Sunday's march and demanded Chun's execution formurder and corruption.   Roh took power Feb. 25 after presidential elections. He haspledged to punish corruption and any other misdeeds under the pastadministration.   They have demanded a probe into alleged corruption under theChun regime. The former president's younger brother, ChunKyung-Hwan, has been charged with embezzling millions of dollars ingovernment funds in a massive extortion and influence peddlingscheme.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' about 300 studentschanted Sunday. They carried a banner that read, ``Execute theChun-Roh clique.''   Hundreds of riot police in combat fatigues and visored helmetscharged the radicals several times to force them back. Policearmored vans fired barrages of tear gas into the ranks of thestudents as rifle squads fired tear gas canisters.   Waves of students pelted police with firebombs that exploded inorange showers of blazing gasoline. Several troopers were coveredin flames that were quickly extinguished by other officers.   The National Assembly is expected to consider opposition callsthis week to establish committees to investigate the Kwangjurevolt, corruption and other matters. The governing DemocraticJustice Party lost its majority in the assembly in April 26elections.</TEXT></DOC>
