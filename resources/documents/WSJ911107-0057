After deliberating for four-and-a-half days, a federalcourt jury here convicted Dallas real estate speculators D.L.&quot;Danny&quot; Faulkner and James Toler, thrift executive Spencer H.Blain Jr., and Arthur Formann, a former real estateappraiser, on most of the 58 counts in the indictment,although not all defendants were charged with all counts.Messrs Faulkner, Toler and Blain were also convicted ofengaging in a racketeering enterprise and were ordered torepay $100 million in illicit profits. Sentencing isscheduled for Jan. 15.</LP><TEXT>   The jury's verdict capped a nine-year odyssey thatprovided the first glimpse into the imminent collapse of theTexas thrift industry. It involved almost every element ofthrift fraud, including kickbacks to thrift executives, phonyappraisals, political influence-peddling, grossly inflatedloans and high-flying thrift executives exhibiting thetrappings of new-found wealth -- Rolex watches, jet airplanesand flashy automobiles.   Eventually, 115 people were charged with federal crimes asa result of the investigation into the condo-financingscheme. Of those charged, 108 have been convicted, includingthe four defendants found guilty yesterday.   The scheme was initiated by Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Toler,whose land purchases along Interstate 30, east of Dallas,gave it its popular name, the I-30 condo scandal. Most of thefinancing for the condominium developments came from EmpireSavings andamp; Loan Association, whose nondescript headquarters ina strip office building in the Dallas suburb of Mesquitebelied its role as the linchpin in the $750 million scheme.   Mr. Blain was formerly chairman and chief executive of thethrift, while Mr. Formann provided the inflated appraisals tosupport the loans that poured out of Empire.   Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Toler reaped tens of millions ofdollars in profits from the sale of overvalued land to about250 people who could ill-afford the $750 million in condodevelopment loans they signed up for. The borrowerseventually defaulted on the loans, which led to the collapseof Empire Savings and at least four other thrifts in Texasand Arkansas. Many other thrifts across the U.S., which hadpurchased participations in the fraudulent loans, also tookbig hits.   Empire Savings was declared insolvent on March 14, 1984,the first federally insured Texas thrift to fail. Withregulators thus alerted to the real estate lending problemsbrewing in Texas, many more thrifts would follow.   &quot;It was the beginning of the end for the guys who abusedtheir charters&quot; to operate thrifts, said Thomas King,president of the Texas Savings andamp; Loan League, a trade group.   Mr. King noted that when he took office in August 1984there were 281 Texas thrifts with assets of about $100billion. Today, excluding the eight thrifts under control offederal thrift regulators, there are only about 65 thrifts inthe state, with assets of about $45 billion.   While the Empire Savings fraud presaged the industry'sproblems, the subsequent prosecution illustrated howdifficult it was going to be to prosecute thrift wrongdoers.The federal criminal investigation, which began in late 1983,focused initially on the lower levels of the fraud, primarilyborrowers who falsified loan documents; the ringleadersweren't indicted until October 1987.   The original trial of those ringleaders, and three otherdefendants, lasted seven months. It ended in September 1989in a hung jury in Lubbock, Texas, where the case had beenmoved because of extensive publicity in Dallas. Followingthat trial, Mr. Faulkner's daughter was tried, and acquitted,of a charge that she had attempted to influence a jurorduring the trial.   The case then bounced back to a Dallas federal court,where an attempt to seat a jury earlier this year endedunsuccessfully because jurors still could recall newsaccounts of the case. The trial was then assigned to federalcourt in Midland, where testimony began in late September andended early last week.   After the verdict yesterday, Mr. Faulkner continued toinsist, as he has all along, that he is innocent ofwrongdoing. &quot;I thought me and my son was just doing normalbusiness out there and I didn't think we was doing anythingwrong,&quot; he said. Mr. Faulkner said he plans to appeal theverdict, as do the three other defendants.   Mr. Faulkner said he believed his conviction was &quot;a signof the times,&quot; reflecting jurors' anger about the cost of thesavings and loan failures. &quot;These jurors, as taxpayers, I canunderstand being upset,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
