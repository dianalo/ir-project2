William Ford, D-Mich., chairman of the House Education and LaborCommittee, said he would push legislation to eliminate state-run OSHA programsin North Carolina and 22 other states, including California, if they aren'toverhauled in the near future.;   &quot;It's beginning to appear to me like peopleare not taking the administration of OSHA very seriously,&quot; Ford said. &quot;I feellike somebody is pulling my chain.&quot;;   In testimony that stunned lawmakers,Imperial Food workers Bobby Quick and Loretta Goodwin recounted the horror oflast week's fire.;   Quick and Goodwin told committee members:;   (check) Theynever received fire safety training or had a fire drill.;   (check) ImperialFood workers were afraid to complain about safety violations in the plant.;  (check) Shortly before the fire, plant manager Brad Roe told a maintenanceworker to hurry repairs on a hydraulic line. That line later ruptured, causingthe fatal fire.;   (check) The plant didn't have a sprinkler system toextinguish fires.;   (check) Workers couldn't escape because several exitswere locked or blocked. Investigators say the Imperial Food workers who diedin the fire would have survived if the plant had sprinklers and the doorsweren't blocked.;   (check) At least two workers injured in the fire wereplaced in body bags at the site, even though they were still alive. Goodwinsaid she saw a woman in a body bag sit up, unzip the bag and climb out.;  Ford and other committee members were outraged that North Carolina OSHAofficials had never inspected the Imperial Food plant.;   Ford also wasinfuriated that North Carolina's OSHA program -- called &quot;disgracefullydeficient&quot; by North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin -- was certified by federal laborofficials as an acceptable program.;   Ford demanded that the U.S. LaborDepartment conduct a comprehensive review of state-run OSHA programs in lessthan 90 days. If state programs aren't up to federal standards, &quot;I'm going topush to . . . put them out of the OSHA business,&quot; he warned.;   Othercommittee members said it was hard to determine whether Ford could carry outhis threat.;   Scannell, who toured Imperial Food after the fire, recalled the&quot;smell of rotten chicken&quot; and &quot;piles of maggots&quot; at the plant.;   &quot;Visitingthe work site was like walking through a kitchen of hell,&quot; Scannelltestified.;   &quot;I wonder if the manager of that plant will ever sleep again atnight,&quot; said committee member and Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GREG TREVOR, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910913  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  482  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 13, 199100257063,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
