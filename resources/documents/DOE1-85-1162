The fuel cell unit rated at 4kW was composed of a reformerusing mixture of methanol and demineralized water as feedstocks and tanks,auxiliary equipments such as heat exchangers, pumps, blowers, power unitwith packaged control system, chopper-type power conversion equipment.The small capacity, outdoor type fuel cell unit rated 4kW/5kVA was composedof a main body of fuel cell power unit and a power conversion equipment.A feed preparation equipment and a waste heat recovery equipment, whichwere optional, were packaged in one unit. The diferences between 4kW/5kVAunit and the 4kW unit were clarified. In the cooling system of the mainbody of 4kW/5kVA unit, an electric heater was installed to deal withload change and partial load. The unit starts full automatically withan operation on a starting switch, and the cell itself continues powergeneration under the minimum load. (11 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
