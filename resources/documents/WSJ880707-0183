The arrangement, though valued at only about $1 million, involves what may be the most sophisticated commercial technology China has ever sold to the U.S., U.S. business officials said. Indeed, the expertise appears to be even more advanced than what U.S. companies are allowed to sell China under U.S. restrictions on sales of high-technology equipment with potential military applications.    &quot;We're coming to grips with the fact that not every piece of technology has to be developed in the U.S.,&quot; said John Kucharski, chairman of EGandamp;G. &quot;The Chinese have truly developed something that's better than what we've been able to come up with.&quot;    The transaction represents one of the few instances in which Chinese technology has been licensed to the U.S. In one other such case, a Chinese unit sold high-temperature sensors to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for measuring stress in jet engines, a trade official said.    Western experts generally laud Chinese scientists for their research skills. But few state-of-the-art developments are brought to the market successfully here.    EGandamp;G, which makes scientific instruments and parts, had $1.25 billion in sales last year. It agreed to purchase know-how and parts for producing helium magnetometers from a unit of China's Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources. The company hopes to sell $10 million of the instruments, which are used in geophysical mapping, minerals exploration and, militarily, detecting submarines.    The instruments will be based on a design developed by a Chinese scientist, Wang Qingye, who has been working on a prototype for the ministry for several years. The U.S. company came into contact with Mr. Wang through earlier business dealings with the ministry. </TEXT></DOC>
