President Bush, outlining a $7.9 billion war on narcotics, warnedLatin American drug traffickers Tuesday night that ``the rules havechanged.''   The speech was broadcast live on Colombian television. Within ahalf-hour, two bombs exploded at banks in the cocaine center ofMedellin, injuring seven people, the radio network Caracol reported.   A police source said the government's 2{-week-old crackdown ontraffickers has virtually paralyzed the nation's cocaine-producinglaboratories.   Bush proposed a four-fold increase in the amount of military andlaw enforcement aid for Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, to $261.2million in 1990. He called it the downpayment on a $2 billion,five-year anti-drug program in the Andean region.   Bush also said he and Colombian President Virgilio Barco hoped toconvene a ``drug summit'' to ``coordinate an inter-American strategyagainst the cartels.''   He singled out Barco for praise for his war on drug barons. ``Wehave a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in Colombia tofight alone,'' said Bush, who had already pledged $65 million in aid.   In Bogota, the international editor of the newspaper ElEspectador, Camilo Cano, said Bush has ``a clear intention'' offighting drug traffickers.   ``The most interesting thing would be to know what is going to bethe specific destination of the $2 billion he promised,'' Cano saidafter the speech. Cano's newspaper office was damaged Saturday by abomb that wounded more than 80 people.   Also Tuesday, the mayor of Bogota banned outdoor marches anddemonstrations for an indefinite period as a precautionary measurein response to terrorist attacks by drug traffickers, Colombianradio reported.   The private national radio network RCN said Bogota Mayor AndresPastrana Arango ordered the ban ``to maintain normal public order.''   In Medellin, where a nighttime curfew has been in effect sincelast week, an armed gang forced everyone out of a restaurant, thenset it afire with gasoline, police said. It was not immediatelyclear if the attack was related to the cocaine barons fighting thegovernment crackdown.   The wave of attacks in Medellin continued Tuesday evening withthe bank bombings, a police spokesman said by telephone. He said hehad no details. Caracol said two girls, 7 and 11, were among sevenpeople suffering cuts from flying glass and other minor injuries.   Police patrolled the streets of Medellin, 150 miles northwest ofBogota, which was the site of four bomb attacks Monday night.   Police gave no motive for the slaying of Angela de Guerrero, 32.She was shot four times as she sat in her small sedan outside asupermarket in Bogota's northern suburbs by two gunmen who fled in awhite car.   Television footage showed a carton of eggs beside the slain womanand hysterical shoppers near the scene.   The victim was identified as the wife of Col. Carlos Guerrero, alogistics planning officer for the joint military forces.   Police have blamed previous instances of random violence on drugtraffickers retaliating for the government crackdown.   The United States delivered five UH-1H ``Huey'' transporthelicopters, modified versions of the combat choppers that gainedprominence during the Vietnam war.   They arrived in a huge C-5 transport plane at Bogota's El Doradoairport, the last of the big-ticket items in President Bush's $65million package to help the government fight its drug war.   In recent days, the United States has sent Colombia five C-130transport planes and eight A37 reconnaissance and attack jets. Theaid also includes machine guns, bulletproof vests, grenades, boatsand trucks.   Drug lords have waged a campaign of bombings, assassinations andthreats, largely to intimidate the government into refusing toextradite drug traffickers wanted in the United States. Colombia'spowerful cartels are believed to supply the United States with 80percent of its cocaine.   The drug war began in earnest Aug. 18, when an assassinationsquad believed hired by drug czars killed leading presidentialcandidate Luis Carlos Galan.   Shortly after the helicopters were unloaded, an apparent bombthreat caused airport security agents to remove passengers andluggage from a jet of Colombia's Avianca Airlines about to take offfor Miami. Soldiers cleared the airport and brought in bomb-sniffingdogs.   A suspicious suitcase, shown on TV newscasts, turned out to befull of rocks.   The National Police said Tuesday that since the crackdown began,cocaine production in Colombia has practically stopped and thatprices should go up as a result. Colombian authorities say they havedestroyed 252 cocaine labs this year.   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo, citing unidentified policesources, on Tuesday forecast a cocaine shortage in the UnitedStates. It also said 2.2 pounds of cocaine, which now costs $1,500in Colombia and $10,000 wholesale in Miami, will go up in price``considerably'' in coming months.   Meanwhile, Eduardo Martinez Romero, indicted by a federal courtin Atlanta on trafficking charges, was believed to be facing thelast day Wednesday on which he could appeal his extradition to theUnited States.   Martinez, 35, an economist, was arrested Aug. 20 and is accusedin connection with the laundering of $1.2 billion in cocaine money.The government, acting under emergency anti-drug measures, orderedhis extradition Aug. 30.   Until now, Colombia has been unable or unwilling to extraditedrug traffickers. Fear pervades the Colombian legal system. Since1980 more than 200 judges and court officials trying to prosecutedrug dealers here have been assassinated.</TEXT></DOC>
