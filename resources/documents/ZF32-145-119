(graphical user interface under development)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bray, Paul.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Xerox, which invented the graphical user interface (GUI) in theearly 1980s, is developing a new GUI called Rooms, in which eachproject has a separate office or 'room.' Rooms is document-based,as opposed to Microsoft Windows 3.0, which is applications-based.andO;Within each room, the user may spread out and work on alldocuments connected with the project, then move onto the nextroom.andP;  Upon returning to the room, everything is as the user leftit, even if the computer has been turned off in the interim.andP;  Thecompleted Rooms GUI will include a 'pocket' in which a user cancarry a diary from room to room.andP;  Users will also be able togather together related rooms into a 'suite.' Rooms is harder tolearn than Windows 3.0, but Xerox claims it better mimics the waypeople actually work.andP;  Rooms will work with another Xeroxinterface, called Globalview.andP;  The first version of Rooms will runon the Sun Microsystems SPARCstation, with an OS/2 version tofollow.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Xerox Corp.
