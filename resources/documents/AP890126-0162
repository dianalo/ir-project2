WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A panel headed by former Secretary of StateEdmund Muskie recommended Thursday a broad tax increase as part of aplan to balance the federal budget, saying ``new taxes will beunavoidable.''   The panel also recommended increasing spending on programshelping children living in poverty, by $2 billion a year for fiveyears.   On national defense, it recommended scaling back goals for earlydeployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Star Warsnuclear space shield program, and called for a temporary moratoriumon new military procurement.   The report, called ``America Tomorrow, the Choices We Face,'' wassent to the White House and other officials of the Bushadministration.   It was the result of a nearly year-long project sponsored by theCenter for National Policy, a public policy research organizationbased in Washington.   Members of the center's steering committee for the project, allof whom signed the report, included Paul A. Volcker, former chairmanof the Federal Reserve Board; Adm. Bobby Inman, former No. 2official at the CIA; Sally Ride, former astronaut; former Sen.Charles McC. Mathias Jr., of Maryland; Douglas A. Fraser, formerhead of the United Auto Workers; Donald M. Stewart, president of theCollege Board,; and Isabel V. Sawhill of the Urban Institute.   The report concludes that massive foreign borrowing and a declinein domestic saving and investment are serious long-term threats toAmerican living standards. It recommends a flexible five-year planto balance the budget and balance foreign trade figures by fiscal1994.   It recommends spending cuts and small revenue increases for thefirst year, followed by a move to a two-year budget cycle in fiscal1991. It would add tax increases amounting to $25 billion over eachof the following four years.   ``New taxes will be unavoidable, not only to achieve a netdeficit reduction of $100 billion, but also to cover infrastructureproblems,'' the report said.   It recommends several possibilities, including raising income taxrates by 1 percent a year for four years; a 25 cent increase in thegasoline tax; an across-the-board tax on energy; raising tobacco andalcohol taxes; taxing Social Security benefits as income;eliminating or limiting the tax deduction for home mortgageinterest, and taxing employer contributions for medical insurance.   ``There is no question that the nation must confront the issue ofwhich existing taxes to increase or what new taxes to create,'' thereport said.   The report said child poverty rates have been rising in recentyears, and seem likely to continue. One quarter of American childrenunder age 6 now live in poverty, and children now represent thepoorest age group in the nation, it said.   It recomends adding $2 billion each year to existing andexperimental poverty programs directed at young children as aninvestment in the prevention of costly long-term problems.   On defense, it said the nation should take advantage of a newrelationship with the Soviet Union by proposing to reduce theconventional arms forces in Europe on both sides ``down to a pointequal to approximately 50 percent of current NATO levels, phased inover eight years.''   It calls for continuing strategic arms control talks andmodernizing the land-based missile force by development of a small,mobile single-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile.   It calls for scaling back deployment goals for Star Wars, whilecontinuing research and arms talks.   The report advocates Pentagon management reforms and would imposea series of procurement moratoriums while review is under way.</TEXT></DOC>
