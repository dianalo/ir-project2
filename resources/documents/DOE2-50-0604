Thedesign requirements for containment of large-scale systems are complexand require detailed analysis to insure that the containment system canhandle both the normal and emergency releases of recombinant DNA organisms.This must include the prevention of releases through either liquid dischargesor air emissions. The &quot;killing&quot; method used in the process for eitherthe cells (extracellular product) or the broth (intracellular product)is an important step and can have significant implications in downstreamtreatment of wastewaters. Since fermentation is the primary process usedin the production of recombinant DNA products, wastewater characteristicsfrom this area of the process are basically similar to those of otherfermentation processes. They differ, however, because of the &quot;killing&quot;step in the process, which can introduce compounds not normally foundin fermentation wastewaters. This can complicate the treatment processby requiring additional treatment operations. Characteristics of wastewatersfrom other areas of the process can be very diverse, and no general characterizationcan be made. Techniques for recovery and purification can vary from productto product or even from plant to plant, making characterization difficult.It is important, therefore, that each process be examined in detail sothat waste characterization is meaningful and useful in the design oftreatment facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
