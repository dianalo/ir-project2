Private foreign investors actually sold $1.5 billion moreU.S. stocks and bonds than they bought in the third quarter.That compares with net purchases of $3.6 billion in thesecond quarter, according to U.S. Treasury data analyzed bythe Securities Industry Association.</LP><TEXT>   Stocks were hard hit. So far this year, foreign investorshave unloaded a net $9.2 billion of U.S. stocks -- $2.4billion of that in the third quarter. By comparison, theybought a net $10.8 billion in the same period last year.   If the trend of the first nine months continues, foreignindividual and institutional investors will have bought a net$2.3 billion of U.S. securities in all of 1990. That is amere 3.2% of the $71.2 billion they added to their portfoliosin the preceding year.   &quot;You've got fewer private foreigners stepping forward toabsorb U.S. securities,&quot; said Susan Hering, an economist atSalomon Brothers Inc. &quot;That shifts the burden to foreignofficial investors or domestic investors.&quot;   How much that affects U.S. markets and the financing ofthe U.S. budget deficit is uncertain. Foreign investorstraditionally have influenced U.S. bond prices more thanstocks, but British and Japanese investors have at timesmoved U.S. equity markets.   In the short term, foreigners' diminishing appetite forU.S. bonds means that U.S. interest rates would be higher andthe dollar weaker than otherwise, if other things remainconstant, said David G. Strongin, director of internationalfinance at the Securities Industry Association.   He and others also pointed out, however, that whileprivate foreign investors sold a net $100 million of U.S.Treasury securities in the third quarter, foreign governmentsand central banks bought a net $11.3 billion.   That's a big jump from late 1989 and early 1990, when theywere net sellers of U.S. Treasurys. Some analysts attributethe huge shift to a flight to quality, as governments andcentral banks -- particularly in Europe and the Middle East-- sold offshore Eurodollar holdings to buy U.S. governmentpaper after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.   No one knows whether the heavy foreign official purchaseswill continue. Regardless, Ms. Hering pointed out that in arecession, corporations borrow less to finance inventory andcapital investment, and individuals borrow less formortgages. In addition, &quot;there's a flight to quality&quot; fromstocks and corporate bonds to U.S. Treasurys. All this makesit easier for the U.S. government to finance its budgetdeficit.   For foreign investors, the factors deterring investment inthe U.S. have been the falling dollar, interest rates thatare lower than those in most other major industrial countriesand the huge federal budget deficit.   &quot;The biggest problem I see in the U.S. has got to be thestate of the economy in light of the budget deficit and theability of the U.S. political leadership to bring it down,&quot;said Richard D. Muckart, director of sales and investing forIvory andamp; Sime PLC in Edinburgh, Scotland. &quot;There's nopolitical will to face up to it, and it could get worse.&quot;   Many analysts believe the dollar could strengthen nextyear. &quot;But I'm still concerned with the budget deficit, thebalance-of-payments deficit, and the {U.S. stock} market isexpensive on its own. At 14 times earnings, it's the mostexpensive market with the exception of Japan and a fewothers,&quot; said Iain Watt, investment director at EdinburghFund Managers PLC in Edinburgh.   &quot;We aren't looking for any earnings growth next year,&quot; headded. &quot;There are more negatives in the U.S. market thanpositives.&quot;   All told, private foreign investors purchased only $900million of U.S. bonds in the third quarter, down from $7.4billion in the second quarter. Based on these trends, &quot;we areheaded for record lows in equities, record lows in Treasurysand a seven-year low in corporate bond purchases byforeigners in 1990,&quot; said the Securities IndustryAssociation's Mr. Strongin.   He pointed out that, after being net sellers of U.S.stocks for eight consecutive months, foreign investors didbuy $1.4 billion in July. But they quickly switched toselling again after the Mideast crisis erupted in earlyAugust.   If foreigners are taking money out of U.S. markets, so areAmericans. In the first three quarters, U.S. investorspurchased a net $7.3 billion of foreign stocks and $15.6billion of overseas debt. While the stock purchases arerunning behind the $9.4 billion for the same period lastyear, foreign bond buying is double any previous full year. Abig lure was the high interest rates and strong currenciesavailable in several major overseas markets.   Most surprising, said Mr. Strongin, is that Americans'purchases abroad were unaffected by the Mideast crisis. Eventhough many foreign markets fell after Iraq's invasion, U.S.investors bought a net $90 million of foreign stocks inAugust. In the same month, American institutions sold a net$1.8 billion of U.S. stocks, according to the securitiesassociation.   &quot;This trend reflects American institutions' continuedcommitment to diversifying their portfolios to includeforeign securities,&quot; said Mr. Strongin. He noted that U.S.institutions have a smaller percentage of their totalholdings invested in foreign securities than institutions inother major countries do.</TEXT></DOC>
