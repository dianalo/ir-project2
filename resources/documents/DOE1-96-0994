<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-96-0994 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors examine the oxygen-releasing behavior of photosynthetic lipidmembranes in plants during the photooxidation of water under the influenceof a manganese oxide catalyst and in the presence of a ruthenium dipyridyloxidizer. The mechanism of catalysis consists of the oxidation of manganeseions and the subsequent oxidation of water by high-valence manganeseoxides. The kinetics involved in the attachment of the reactants to thelipid vesicle are investigated using the oxygen 18 isotope. The isotopiccomposition of the water and the liberated oxygen indicated that oxygenis generated from water on the manganese catalyst in the presence ofvesicles. The import of the results for solar energy conversion is cited.</TEXT></DOC>
