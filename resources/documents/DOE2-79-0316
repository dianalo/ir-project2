Unlike the product of the v-erbB oncogene, which is a truncatedversion of the EGF receptor, the glycoprotein encoded by the v-fms oncogeneretains an intact extracellular ligand-binding domain so that cells transformedby v-fms express CSF-1 receptors at their surface. Although fibroblastssusceptible to transformation by v-fms generally produce CSF-1, v-fms-mediatedtransformation does not depend on an exogenous source of the growth factor,and neutralizing antibodies to CSF-1 do not affect the transformed phenotype.An alteration of the v-fms gene product at its extreme carboxyl-terminusrepresents the more structural difference between it and the c-fms-codedglycoprotein and may affect the tyrosine kinase activity of the v-fms-codedreceptor. Consistent with this interpretation, tyrosine phosphorylationof the v-fms products in membranes was observed in the absence of CSF-1and was not enhanced by addition of the murine growth factor. Cells transformedby v-fms have a constitutively elevated specific activity of a guaninenucleotide-dependent, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate-specific phospholipaseC. The authors speculate that the tyrosine kinase activity of the v-fms/c-fmsgene products may be coupled to this phospholipase C, possibly througha G regulatory protein, thereby increasing phosphatidylinositol turnoverand generating the intracellular second messengers diacylglycerol andinositol triphosphate.</TEXT></DOC>
