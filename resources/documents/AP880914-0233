KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Legislation to impose tougher economicsanctions on white-dominated South Africa is under examination by asharply divided Senate panel, with opponents saying the bill wouldlimit the options of the next U.S. president.   Although the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was expected toapprove the sanctions bill on a narrow, party-line vote today,supporters conceded they had neither the votes to shut off debateon the Senate floor nor to override a near-certain veto byPresident Reagan should the bill pass.   The bill, intended as a follow-up to a set of milder sanctionsenacted over a Reagan veto in 1986, would require an end to mosttrade with South Africa and the withdrawal of most U.S. businessinvestment from the racially divided nation.   The House approved similar legislation on Aug. 11.   Republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunitylast week to vote on amendments as some GOP senators said changesmight make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose.   The 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition ofsenators from both parties.   But only a few Republicans have indicated they are ready tosupport a stronger set of sanctions, with some contending that atrade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the UnitedStates may have to encourage Pretoria to end the country's systemof forced racial separation and control known as apartheid.   They also said that adopting the sanctions bill now wouldforeclose the options of the next president whether he beRepublican George Bush, who opposes sanctions, or Democrat MichaelDukakis, who favors them.   The State Department also opposes the legislation, contendingits passage might disrupt U.S.-mediated talks among South Africa,Angola and Cuba aimed at South African withdrawal from theterritory of South West Africa, or Namibia, and the withdrawal ofCuban troops from Angola.   Democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means ofsending a strong signal to South Africa that the United States iswilling to pay a price to end the apartheid system.   They said the issue is a moral one, not political, and thatsanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violentrevolution inside South Africa by moving that country towardmultiracial democratic rule.</TEXT></DOC>
