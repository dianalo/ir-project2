But for auto workers -- the largest blue-collar bloc in the nation -- it's already here.    Week by week, plant by plant, the layoffs have been mounting. Now 65,200 hourly employees of the Big Three auto makers are on indefinite layoff. That's 60% more than last year, and the highest layoff tally since the dark days of 1983. Fully one-tenth of the auto industry's hourly work force is now out of a job with no clear prospects of coming back.    Adding to the pain, the so-called unemployment safety nets at both General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. are beginning to fray. For the first time since the early 1980s recession, the size and duration of unemployment benefits at these two companies have been cut.    The picture could get worse this year, if, as some analysts project, car sales drop off. Even if that doesn't happen, GM will get rid of more workers when it completes announced plant closings and possibly announces more. Just this week, it said it will shut indefinitely its Leeds, Mo., plant, putting 1,600 more people out of work in April. Chrysler this week said it will announce within 60 days one plant closing as part of its consolidation following the acquisition of American Motors Corp.    The past couple of years have &quot;been a bonanza for companies and profits but it hasn't been that good for workers,&quot; complains Owen Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers union.    At first blush, the dire employment situtation may seem surprising. The UAW grabbed headlines last fall for getting strong job &quot;guarantees&quot; from GM and Ford Motor Co. in contract negotiations. But those agreements covered jobs lost through specific company measures -- such as use of new technology and gains in productivity -- and explicitly exempted layoffs that are attributable to sales downturns. The union's helplessness against that major threat became clear just two weeks after workers overwhelmingly ratified the GM contract. The largest auto maker announced it would idle 3,700 workers by closing indefinitely its Framingham, Mass., assembly plant.    The high layoffs also may appear perplexing because the auto industry, overall, seems to be doing pretty well. When 1987 results are reported next month, the Big Three combined are expected to show record earnings of nearly $10 billion.    But those figures are deceiving. They are based on last year's sales, while production -- and hence employment -- is pegged to this year's projected sales. In addition, Ford's stellar performance covered up for the stumbling GM, which more than doubled its unemployment rolls in 1987 to 55,200 workers. GM now accounts for 80% of the Big Three's indefinite layoffs and only 40% of the profit.    But even a healthy GM wouldn't likely save all those workers. Ford, after all, used heavy outsourcing -- the transfer of work to lower-cost companies -- and overtime to rack up more than $3 billion in profit with nearly the same size work force it had during the recession. Despite operating at full capacity, Ford still has 6,900 workers on indefinite layoff, most hanging on since the early 1980s.    A similar phenomenon will likely emerge at GM. &quot;We'll make more money in '88 on the same (sales) volume because of what we've been able to do in the past years in modernizing our plants,&quot; Chairman Roger B. Smith said at a recent news conference. In other words, better earnings but fewer jobs.    Chrysler's employment situation has less to do with slow sales. It placed a large portion of its workers on temporary layoff last year during a sweeping company-wide retooling and renovation. That largely completed, company and union officials say they are optimistic employment will rise. But sluggish business did force the auto maker in November, for the first time since the recession, to lay off workers temporarily to reduce inventory. Some analysts expect more of the same this year.    The effects of all those layoffs are slowly but surely showing up. While the national unemployment rate dropped in December to 5.8%, Michigan's jobless rate was 8.8%, the highest of the major industrial states. A recent University of Michigan study concluded that GM's announced layoffs -- and the ripple effect -- will push the state's unemployment rate up by one percentage point over the next year and a half.    For the past three decades, layoffs have been less painful for auto workers than other U.S. workers because they have one of the strongest income-protection programs in the country: the supplemental unemployment benefit, or SUB, fund. At its best, the company-financed SUB program combines with other unemployment compensation payments to assure laid-off auto workers 95% of their take home pay for as long as two years, depending on their seniority.    But mounting layoffs are draining the fund. In November, GM was forced for the first time since 1983 to borrow from a special credit line it designed to keep SUB payments going. While Ford's SUB pool stands at a healthy 41.6% funded, Chrysler's is at 3% and GM's is at 2.6%.    At GM and Chrysler, both the size of the benefits and their duration have been slashed. While workers with 20 years seniority haven't been affected at all, those with less than 10 years on the line are being hit hard.    At GM, the benefit reductions began in late 1986 and have accelerated in the past four months. Since November, laid-off workers with under 10 years seniority have been getting SUB checks for only 16 weeks, compared with a previous maximum of 52 weeks. If they have under five years seniority, they get benefits for only 11 weeks. The same has been true for Chrysler since September. One GM official says the fund is in such precarious shape that &quot;in the next few weeks&quot; payments for low-seniority workers will likely be cut to six weeks.    And in October, both GM and Chrysler cut the size of those checks by 20%.    Here's what this means to a Flint, Mich., assembly-line worker of four years, married, with two kids, earning gross pay of $568.80 a week. If he were laid off when the benefit fund was in good shape, he would receive, for a full year, $390.36 a week in total SUB and unemployment compensation payments. Instead, the weekly payments are now $360.69. In three months, the SUB portion of the payments disappears and he relies for the next four months on $242 a week in state unemployment compensation. After that, all payments stop.    &quot;It's put a real crimp in their living standards,&quot; says Dave Yettaw, president of the UAW local at GM's Buick City complex in Flint, which is currently operating on only one shift. &quot;Some of them are living on $700 a month when they were used to living on $1,400.&quot; The problem has been made worse, he adds, because most of these workers haven't been laid off before and &quot;they think there's something magic after their SUB runs out.&quot; Longer SUB payments, he says, &quot;would have eased the transition&quot; to other employment.    Attempting to preserve benefits for individual workers as long as possible, the UAW is increasingly spreading the burden of unemployment. At GM plants in Lansing, Mich., Van Nuys, Calif., and Oshawa, Ontario, for example, where full shifts have been shut down, workers alternate weeks collecting paychecks and unemployment checks.    The UAW has taken other steps to keep the money flowing. In the contracts negotiated with GM and Ford last fall, the union won increases in corporate contributions to the SUB funds, and doubled the size of the special credit line. It also hopes companies will cut more people from the rolls with sweetened early retirement and buy-out provisions.    But even with those measures, the hardship will likely increase. &quot;SUB was designed to even out seasonal layoffs,&quot; says Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California at San Diego. &quot;It was never meant to sustain the large number of people laid off during a restructuring that the industry has been going through.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
