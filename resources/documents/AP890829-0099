No one was injured in the March hijacking of the Malev Airlinesjet, but Frankfurt juvenile court judge Klaus Dirszoweit said theteen-agers had put passengers' lives in danger.   Stefan Macicko, 17, and Dusan Styck, 16, said they seized theplane because they wanted asylum in the West.   Armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle, they grabbed ahostage at Prague's Ruzyne airport on March 29 and forced their wayonto the Soviet-built Tupolev-154 plane, firing a single shot intothe air.   After releasing 82 passengers, including all the women andchildren, they forced the plane to fly to West Germany with 11remaining passengers and a crew of four.   They surrendered peacefully at Frankfurt airport, where the planehad been scheduled to fly, three hours after the hijacking began.They confessed to authorities, and there was no trial.   The court said the teen-agers would be transferred to a youthhome in West Germany's Hesse state, where they will be allowed toattend school while serving the probation.   Shortly after the hijacking, Czechoslovak authorities requestedextradiction of the teen-agers, but West German officials decided toprosecute them in Frankfurt instead.</TEXT></DOC>
