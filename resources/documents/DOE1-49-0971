The possibilities of using solar energy andits conversion forms of hydroelectric power, wind energy, biomass, environmentalheat and solar hydrogen (as a secondary energy carrier) are presented,using typical pilot projects. The analysis of the technological status,the main centres of development interest and the operating and damageexperience demonstrates the risks involved in these energy technologies.The investigation of the technical and economic development potentialleads to an assessment of the position of the alternative energy sourcesin the electricity supply market. This leads to a survey of their importancein the future insurance market.</TEXT></DOC>
