To studythe effect of attenuation and scatter on SPECT quantitation, phantomstudies were performed with non-uniform attenuation. Simulated transmissionCT data provided information about the distribution of attenuation coefficientswithin the source. Attenuation correction was performed by an iterativereprojection technique. Scatter correction was done by convolution ofthe attenuation-corrected image and an appropriate filter. The filtercharacteristics depended on the attenuation and activity measurementat each pixel. The scatter correction could compensate completely forthe 28% scatter component from a line source, and the 61% component froma thick, extended source. Accuracy of regional activity ratios and thelinearity of the relationship between true radioactivity and the SPECTmeasurement were both significantly improved by these corrections. Thepresent method is expected to be valuable for the quantitative assessmentof regional activity.</TEXT></DOC>
