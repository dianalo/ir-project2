The U.S. Export-Import Bank suspended its new Sovietprogram, which earlier had attracted applications for loanguarantees amounting to nearly $2 billion. At the same time,the European Community froze action on technical aid valuedat $528 million and $625 million in credit guarantees that ithad approved for food sales to the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   And this time, unlike during last year's Persian Gulfcrisis, Japan was right in step with the U.S. in respondingto an international crisis. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu toldthe Japanese parliament that he will put on hold Tokyo'sexport credits and insurance programs for the Soviet Union.   The allies appeared to be responding to President Bush'surgings for such a demonstration to convince the coup leadersin Moscow that they can't count on any support from theworld's democracies. &quot;I think the world is turning to theUnited States for leadership here,&quot; Mr. Bush told reporters.   The Soviets &quot;have some serious economic problems, and theyneed the help of the West, and they need the cooperation ofEastern Europe,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;And they're not going to getit under existing conditions.&quot;   The freezing of these credits will temporarily haltshipments of capital goods and grain, although there may beexemptions for emergency food aid. &quot;We don't want to hurtpeople anywhere in terms of starvation,&quot; Mr. Bush said.   The new European Bank for Reconstruction and Developmentalso moved toward a suspension of its operations in theSoviet Union. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency,the bank President Jacques Attali said he hoped that thebank's member countries, &quot;together with the rest of theworld, will take all measures within their power to ensurethat this intolerable &quot;coup d'etat&quot; will not succeed.&quot;   The bank was established last year by Western governmentsto help finance economic development in the Soviet Union andEastern Europe.   Britain, France and Spain also suspended their bilateralaid to the Soviet Union. Although French banks hadn't yetreceived a written directive from the French FinanceMinistry, an official of a French bank told Reuters that theministry's export department had &quot;suspended all itsguaranteed credit lines&quot; to the Soviet Union.   Although other Western governments were already buildingup their Soviet loan portfolios, the U.S. Ex-Im Bank had yetto issue its first loan guarantee when all these programswere suspended. &quot;There was an awful lot of demand for thesecredits, and just a limited supply of funds to satisfy it,&quot;said Eugene Lawson, the bank's vice chairman.   Several U.S. companies had rushed to the bank's newlyopened Soviet window, attracted by President Bush's earlierpledges to aid the Soviet Union and to ask Congress to repeala Cold War-era statute placing a $300 million cap on allEx-Im Bank credits to the Soviet Union.   The processing of the applications has been slowed byelaborate procedures that the bank has to follow, includingclearing each application through Congress and obtainingapproval of the Soviet foreign relations bank, known as VEB.   The new freeze has left three prospective Ex-Im banktransactions -- the only ones approved by the Soviets --hanging. Two of them, amounting to $78 million, had clearedCongress and were just awaiting final processing by a NewYork financial institution designated by the Soviets. Thebank identified the U.S. principals as Cross Co., a machinetool-making unit of Cross andamp; Trecker Corp., Bloomfield, Mich.;and Exide Corp., a Troy, Mich., battery maker.   A third deal, whose U.S. principal hasn't been identified,is still awaiting Congress's approval. Mr. Lawson said thebank is calling off its lobbying to repeal the statutory capuntil the current crisis is resolved.   The loss of Japanese official aid could be felt by one ofthe Soviet institutions believed to be supporting the coup.Some of this assistance was intended to help the SovietDefense Ministry convert military plants to civilian use,Japanese diplomats said.</TEXT></DOC>
