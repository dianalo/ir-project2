In leveraged buyouts, where the target's assets and futureearnings are often pledged as collateral for loans, ``you load thosecompanies with debt,'' the head of the steel and oil company said.   ``That means...you have to cut all spending in order to servicethe debt. You cut the research. You cut the capital spending,'' hesaid at USX management's quarterly news conference.   ``Is it desirable in a competitive world, where we are fightingfor our manufacturing lives? The answer is no. It's going to make usprogressively less competitive in those sectors that are being takenover with the use of debt.''   Even in light of the recent takeover frenzy, involvingmultibillion dollar battles for such huge manufacturers as RJRNabisco Inc. and Kraft Inc., Roderick does not favor regulatingcorporate takeovers, even though he believes they reflectshortsightedness.   USX itself could be a takeover target. Roderick said the stockmarket has undervalued the company's stock, which closed at $28 ashare, down 50 cents on Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange trading.   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn, who has held an 11.4 percentstake in USX since 1986, seems content with his investment and hasnot renewed his threat to make an offer for the company, Rodericksaid.   The USX chairman, who dines occasionally with Icahn, said Icahn'sapparent reluctance to make a run at the company is not the resultof any personal courtesy to Roderick, who will retire next spring.   ``I would assume that Mr. Icahn will ultimately do what he thinksis good for Mr. Icahn,'' Roderick said.   ``I remember Carl told me at one point...if you want a friend onWall Street, you buy a dog.''   The shift in the U.S. economy from manufacturing to serviceindustries should not be allowed to go too far, Roderick said.   ``You can't...have manufacturing disappear. How do you defend thecountry and lead the world in free-world defense by knowing how tomake hamburgers?'' he said.   ``Ninety-two percent of the non-medical research done in thiscountry is done by manufacturing,'' Roderick said. ``You don't haveto research a lot if you're talking about travelers checks orbarbers.''</TEXT></DOC>
