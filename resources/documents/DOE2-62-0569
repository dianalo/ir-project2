<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-62-0569 </DOCNO><TEXT>An algorithm is presented for the determination of loading schedules,for a 24 hour period, for a purely hydro-electric generation system.The application of this algorithm to an actual system consisting of 44hydro-electric power stations, containing some 73 turbines, is described.Typical results for this system are presented and the computational requirementsdiscussed. Finally, the use of different objective functions, and theeffects of these on power system performance, are considered.</TEXT></DOC>
