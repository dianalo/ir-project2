The letter from ``D'' _ his identity is known to Public HealthService officials _ was among eight from people with AIDS being readtoday during a World AIDS Day ceremony at the Department of Healthand Human Services.   ``I live in the Bible Belt of our country,'' began the letter toDr. Robert E. Windom, the No. 2 physician in the federal healthdepartment. ``I have lived most of my life in a small town inAlabama. I attend a large university in Alabama and will soon befinishing my junior year.   ``I can't tell you my name because my short life of only 20 yearswould be over very quickly. It would be over sooner than AIDS willprobably take it. I'm HIV positive and have been so diagnosed sincespring of 1987.   ``I sit in classrooms and hear people discuss AIDS and what theythink they know is right. Why can't I speak up and tell them theycan't get it from just being in the same room? Why can't I tell themthe truth?   ``I'm so afraid of what will happen if I openly admit to beingHIV positive. Would I get kicked out of school? I was so afraid ofwhat people would think, I didn't even talk to my parents about itfor six months. I was hurting so bad. I was lonely.   ``Now, my father has never even said the word AIDS and my motheronly makes sure I'm in good health and eating right and takingvitamins.''   Windom, the assistant secretary for health, arranged the program,including an opening minute of silence for the people who have diedof AIDS.   As of Nov. 7, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 77,994 Americans,of whom more than half, or 43,888, have died since June 1, 1981,according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
