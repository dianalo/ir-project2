Thus, we now have House Majority LeaderRichard Gephardt talking up a new tax to produce streams ofrevenue for party stalwarts. Mr. Gephardt would impose acorporate surtax of 2% on annual income over $10 million fora new &quot;fund&quot; that the states could use to finance programsfor children. The financing would take the form of a &quot;bonus&quot;paid to states that gave preschoolers various forms of healthcare. Insofar as the program coverage of such taxes tends toexpand over time, the Gephardt tax appears to be a formulafor indirectly creating a government-corporate state. Is thatwhat the party is all about?</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
