We measure the electron-impact optical emission crosssections of the (1,2), (4,0), and (4,1) vibration bands of the c{sub4}/sup '/{yields}a electronic transition of the nitrogen molecule andcompare them with the direct electron-impact cross sections of the c{sub4}/sup '/(v') vibrational levels reported in the literature. The Franck-Condonfactors between the ground vibrational level of the X {sup 1}{Sigma}/subg/{sup +} ground electronic state and the various vibrational levelsof c{sub 4}/sup '/ have been calculated and compared with the electron-impactcross sections. The excitation cross sections of the v' = 4 level ofc{sub 4}/sup '/ are several orders of magnitude higher than predictedby the Franck-Condon picture. This discrepancy is due to the perturbationsof the c{sub 4}/sup '/(v' = 4) level by the b' {sup 1}{Sigma}/sub u/{sup+} state.</TEXT></DOC>
