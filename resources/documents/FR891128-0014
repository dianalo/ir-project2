This regulation has not been amended or revised since thattime. The agency believes that the procedures for submitting confidentialbusiness information have generally worked well since 1982, but practicalexperience in processing this information has shown that some improvementsand clarifications are advisable. The proposed modifications were publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 7, 1989 (54 FR 28696) (the NPRM).Six organizations responded to the agency's solicitation for public comments.Although five minor revisions have been made in the final regulation inresponse to comments, the comments generally reflect approval of the proposedchanges. NHTSA has also modified Appendices A and B and andSection;512.5(b)to make clarifications in response to comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The agency's proposals for which commenters expressed support or no opinionhave not been included in the Discussion of Comments. The explanation ofsuch proposals contained in the NPRM is incorporated by reference for thepurposes of this Notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impairment of Protectable Government Interests</ITAG>The revision in andSection;512.5 relating to the impairment of protectablegovernment interests attracted the attention of Ford Motor Company. Whilebasically agreeing with need for a change, Ford suggested expanding thissection to include the concept that confidentiality should be granted ifdisclosure was likely to impair a ``private interest.'' Ford proposed toaccomplish this by inserting the words ``or private'' after ``government''in andSection;512.4(b)(3)(viii) and andSection;512.5(c) in recognition of dictain cases cited in the NPRM. The agency is reluctant to make this changein the absence of clear judicial decisions which determine that the disclosureof confidential information causes a private harm other than a substantialharm to the competitive position of the submitter. The addition of andSection;512.5(c)and andSection;512.4(b)(3)(viii) in the NPRM responds to a genuine need forprotection of government interests that are not otherwise recognized, i.e.,the impairment of program effectiveness or compliance. However, the agencybelieves that the regulation sufficiently covers private interests in andSection;512.4(g)and andSection;512.5(a), and therefore will not incorporate Ford's proposedamendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Submitter's Supporting Certification</ITAG>Volkswagen of America, Inc., and Ford requested changes to the certificationin Appendix A. Volkswagen wanted Appendix A to include both the form ofthe affidavit and the form of the certification if the agency was trulywilling to accept either format. By expressing willingness in the NPRMto accept affidavits which contain the statements contained in the proposedAppendix A, the agency did not intend to formally create an optional format.NHTSA is satisfied with one format, but a certification in that format,that is also notarized, will not be rejected as insufficient.Ford asserted that the qualifying words ``to the best of my information,knowledge and belief,'' which were deleted from paragraph (6) of the certification,should be retained. Ford also questioned whether it was possible for abusy company executive to make the ``personal inquiry'' indicated in paragraph(3) of the certification without the use of such qualifying language. NHTSAagrees to correct this oversight by adding the words ``information andbelief,'' after ``knowledge'' in paragraph (4). The agency believes thatthis will adequately address Ford's concern for fairness to the declarantwho may use subordinates to aid him in his inquiries, and yet, not interferewith the statutory requirements of 28 USC 1746 and 18 USC 1001 concerningunsworn declarations to the government under penalty of perjury. <ITAG tagnum="84">New Class Determinations </ITAG>All of the commenters provided suggestions concerning the class determinationslisted and proposed for listing in Appendix B. If the agency determinesthat public release of a particular class of information typically wouldresult in substantial competitive harm and publishes that determinationin Appendix B, a rebuttable presumption is created about the likelihoodof such harm if information of that type were publicly released. This presumptionhas the effect of eliminating the requirement that the submitter initiallydemonstrate the elements contained in andSection; 512.4(b)(3)(vi). The commenting automobile manufacturers generally supported the GeneralMotors Corporation's petition for the agency to make a class determinationabout cost information. General Motors offered an amendment to its originaldraft limiting ``cost'' to ``manufacturer's cost.'' Volkswagen suggestedthat the presumptive determination include ``future actual as well as estimatedcost.'' Ford asked that the agency craft a presumption that includes thekinds of cost data that the agency generally has withheld. Chrysler MotorsCorporation asserted that no distinction should be made between generalcost estimates, ranges of costs and specific actual cost data relatingto a product because all could be damaging if disclosed. However, these suggestions do not adequately address the concern of theagency that a highly inclusive presumption may erroneously encompass coststhat under certain circumstances are not entitled to confidential protection.Public Citizen and the Freedom of Information Clearinghouse echoed thisconcern, stating that it is difficult to draft a determination relatingto cost that is not overbroad. While the presumption would be rebuttable,NHTSA wants to avoid confusion, misunderstanding and wasteful effort consideringclaims involving, for example, meaninglessly overbroad estimates of futurecosts or cost elements which may have inadvertently been introduced intothe public domain. NHTSA does not believe that it will suffer an impairedability to obtain cost information without the presumption, as one commentersuggested, nor does it believe that the evidence on cost submissions isclear enough to permit the drafting of a sufficiently narrow provisionat this time. The agency therefore has decided that a new class determinationrelating to costs is not advisable. General Motors' suggested class determinationis, therefore, not adopted. Three companies made comments on NHTSA's proposed amendments to paragraphs(2) and (3) of the current class determinations in Appendix B. GeneralMotors and Volkswagen suggested that ``model year'' be clarified to meanthe vehicle production period. Ford proposed that product plans be protecteduntil the date on which the last of the specific models to which the productplans pertain is first offered for sale. All of these comments demonstrate the necessity for clarification of theterminology ``product plans'' and ``model year.'' The phrase ``first offeredfor sale'' is more precise than ``the beginning of the model year'' inparagraph (2). Also the concept of ``production period'' is better suitedfor explaining the presumption in paragraph (3). NHTSA believes that paragraphs(2) and (3) have been simplified and more correctly stated by the adoptionof these changes. In addition, Volkswagen wanted model plans protected to the end of theproduction period, not the beginning, because certain specific productsor features are scheduled for introduction some time after such periodbegins. The agency does not agree with Volkswagen's suggestion to protectmodel plans until the end of the model production period. If there is aspecific change that is scheduled to take place relating to a certain modelvehicle after production of such model begins, it should be pointed outby the submitter when such change will be offered to the public. The specificchange can then be protected until it is offered to the public, while theremainder of the information pertaining to that vehicle will be releasedwhen the vehicle is first offered to the public. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Provisions </ITAG>The amendment relating to voluntary submissions in andSection; 512.5 wasthe subject of comments from both Ford and General Motors. Ford suggestedthat this section be expanded to include the concept that confidentialityshould be granted if disclosure was likely to impair the ability of NHTSAto obtain necessary similar information in the future, even though NHTSAcould compel disclosure of such information. General Motors made the pointthat material that is ostensibly obtainable via compulsory process mightbe considered, in some instances, the equivalent of a voluntary submission.However, as was stated in the NPRM on page 28698 and by General Motorsin its comments, whether future submissions of information could be compelledis only a factor to be considered in deciding if governmental access toinformation will be impaired by disclosure, but it is not necessarily dispositive.<T3>Public Citizen Health Research Group </T3>v. <T3>FDA, </T3>704 F.2d 1280, 1291 n. 29 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <T3>Washington Post Co. </T3>v. <T3>HHS, </T3>690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Moreover, the agency recognizesthat courts have given great weight to agency determinations that the releaseof information will not cause impairment. <T3>General Electric Co. </T3>v. <T3>NRC, </T3>750 F.2d 1394, 1402 (7th Cir. 1984); <T3>ATandamp;T Information Systems </T3>v. <T3>GSA</T3>, 627 F. Supp. 1396, 1401 (D.D.C. 1986), reversed and remandedon procedural grounds, 810 F.2d 1233 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The changes proposed in the NPRM were intended to reflect more accuratelythe established case law but not to enumerate every factor to be consideredwhen deciding whether information should be protected from disclosure.Furthermore, this regulation is intended to be procedural, and not substantive.Because of these factors, the agency believes that it is inappropriateto attempt to amend the regulation according to the ongoing judicial developmentof highly specific disclosure exceptions under the Freedom of InformationAct. Consequently, the agency is satisfied that the regulation should providebroad categories and a flexible framework based upon well established judicialprecedent. In order to respond to the concerns expressed by Ford and GeneralMotors and to avoid future confusion about voluntary submissions of informationas outlined in recent judicial decisions, the regulation has been modifiedto delete entirely the references to voluntary submissions in andSection;512.5(b). The agency will, however, make no change to andSection; 512.4(b)(3)(vii)which permits the submitter to explain impairment when the informationis submitted voluntarily. This modification of the proposal also accommodatesprecisely the issues raised by General Motors and Ford, reflects accuratelythe established case law and maintains a broad, flexible framework forsubmitters using the regulation. Public Citizen and the Freedom of Information Clearinghouse expressed concernabout the timing of NHTSA's confidentiality determinations. On this point,the NPRM did not propose any substantive changes from the original regulation.Nevertheless, these commenters suggested that the agency should decideon and publish a date certain by which confidentiality determinations willbe made. Ten days were recommended to be a reasonable period of time. Thecommenters said that without further clarification, andSection; 512.6(b),which requires placing in the public file copies of documents from whichinformation claimed to be confidential or privileged has been deleted pendingresolution of such claim, is likely to mislead the public. The agency does not agree that the procedures in andSection; 512.6(b) aremisleading. All persons having an interest in files from which informationhas been redacted, may, and frequently do, make further inquiries aboutadditional information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. In thesesituations, NHTSA's practical experience with the regulation has been excellent,as explained below, and the agency is satisfied that the public has pursuedinformation under this statute in instances where more information waswanted. In such instances, as noted in andSection; 512.6(c), the agency mustrespond within the statutory time periods. It is also important to pointout that because of practical manpower restraints, the agency would notalways be able to meet a self-imposed deadline for redacted informationabout which there was no expressed public interest and also fulfill itsobligations to persons requesting information under statutory deadlines.Moreover, the agency believes that the processing of voluminous files forwhich confidential treatment has been requested has been expeditious andorderly under the applicable provisions of the existing regulation. Accordingly,the agency declines to make the suggested changes. Public Citizen and the Freedom of Information Clearinghouse also objectedto the proposed change in andSection; 512.4(j) (currently andSection; 512.4(i)).In this section, the agency proposed to replace the provision requiringthe denial of confidential claims when information is submitted withoutthe certification required by andSection; 512.4(e) with a provision makingit discretionary to deny or accept such claims. General Motors commentedin support of the change, noting that the automatic denial of confidentialtreatment is ``an unnecessarily harsh penalty for what may be an inadvertentomission.'' The provisions of andSection; 512.4(e) mandate that the submitter's certificationbe included with every request to the agency for the confidential protectionof information. The agency continues to believe that the certificationis the best method by which a submitter can demonstrate compliance withthe requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. Furthermore, NHTSAis prepared to deny claims which do not reasonably comply with andSection;512.4(e). However, it is not justifiable for the agency to be compelledto deny a claim for confidential treatment which includes no certificationbut which is clearly exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom ofInformation Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). In circumstances where the agencyis absolutely satisfied that a submitter has made a serious claim for confidentialprotection of information, the information has not been released to thepublic, and the information is properly protectable under Exemption 4,the agency should not require itself to disclose the information. The proposedmodification realistically retains the certification requirement withoutcreating the potentially improper technical conflict between the regulation'sprocedures and the demands of the Freedom of Information Act. For thisreason, NHTSA believes that this comment lacks merit. Accordingly, theproposed change has been adopted.General Motors questioned whether documents submitted under a claim ofconfidentiality would be adequately protected until the Chief Counsel hasmade a determination and suggested that the regulation provide appropriatesafeguards to prevent inadvertent disclosure of documents. NHTSA is satisfiedthat this concern is covered by the regulation in andSection; 512.6(h) whichprovides that no information will be released prior to the time that theChief Counsel makes a decision under the regulation. Furthermore, the purposeof this rule is to establish procedures to consider claims of confidentialityand not to specify internal agency procedures for document protection.Consequently, no change is being made in the Final Rule.Ford raised an issue relating to whether andSection; 512.4(j)(l) should referenceparagraph (a) or subparagraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section.The agency considered this suggestion, but believes that all of the subparagraphsof paragraph (a) are sufficiently inter-related to justify the referenceto the entire paragraph. The agency believes that the submitter shouldbe responsible for providing a correctly sanitized second copy of informationin accordance with subparagraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5), or suffer the consequencesof waiver arising out of an inadvertent disclosure. NHTSA cannot agreeto be responsible for finding errors in such second copies, and believesthat waiver of the claim is fair and is the proper result of such submittererror.Finally, Ford suggested that in andSection; 512.9(a) the word ``and'' bereplaced with ``or'' in the series ``andSection;andSection; 512.4, 512.6 and512.7'' because such sections would never be invoked simultaneously inclaiming or determining confidentiality. The agency agrees with this commentand has adopted it in this Final Rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>The agency has considered whether this action would have any federalismimplications. We have determined that this Notice would not have any impactupon the principles of federalism.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic and Other Effects</ITAG>NHTSA has analyzed the effect of this action and has determined that itis not ``major'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 or ``significant''within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policiesand procedures. The amendments would have a minimal effect on submittersof alleged confidential information to the agency. This determination hasbeen made because the regulation is essentially procedural. It will nothave an appreciable impact on the cost of seeking confidential treatmentfor data submitted to the agency. It will also not have an appreciableimpact on what information is or is not accorded confidential protection.Therefore, neither a draft Regulatory Analysis nor a full Regulatory Evaluationis required.In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency has evaluatedthe effects of this rule on small entities. For the reasons stated above,I certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, the preparation ofan Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is unnecessary.The requirements of part 512 are considered to be information collectionrequirements as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. Accordingly, the exisitng requirements of part512 have been submitted to and approved by OMB pursuant to the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The OMB clearance number is 2127-0025.The agency has also analyzed this action for the purpose of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. The agency has determined that this action willnot have any effect on the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 512</ITAG>Administrative procedure and practice, Confidential business information,Freedom of information, Motor vehicle safety, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR part 512 is revised to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 512_CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.1 Purpose and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.2 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.4 Asserting a claim for confidential treatment of information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.5 Substantive standards for affording confidential treatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.6 Determination of confidential treatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.7 Petitions for reconsideration upon denial of a request for confidentialtreatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.8 Modification of confidentiality determinations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.9 Release of confidential business information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.10 Class determinations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix A to part 512_Certificate In Support of Request for Confidentiality</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix B to part 512_Class Determinations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix C to part 512_OMB Clearance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>49 U.S.C. 322; 5 U.S.C. 552; 15 U.S.C. 1401; 15 U.S.C.1402; 15 U.S.C. 1407; 15 U.S.C. 1418; 15 U.S.C. 1914; 15 U.S.C. 1944; 15U.S.C. 1990d; 15 U.S.C. 2005; 15 U.S.C. 2029; delegation of authority at49 CFR 1.50.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 512.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and scope.</ITAG>The purpose of this part is to establish the procedure by which NHTSA willconsider claims that information submitted to the agency, or which theagency otherwise obtains, is confidential business information, as describedin 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 512.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.</ITAG>(a) This part applies to all information which is submitted to NHTSA, orwhich NHTSA otherwise obtains, except as provided in paragraph (b) of thissection.(b) Information received as part of the procurement process is subjectto the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR, Chapter 1, as well as thispart.
