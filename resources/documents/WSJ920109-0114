Over regular phone wires, from any old house or office,computers with the right equipment can tap into a vast arrayof information and contacts, let you send messages, memos,reports and drawings to other computers world-wide,communicate with your office from home or hotels, and evensend and receive faxes.</LP><TEXT>   To do this, you need a device called a modem. Most modemsare inexpensive; they're not particularly hard to install;and with the right software to control them, they can bepretty straightforward to operate. But learning about them isconfusing because the subject is cloaked in densecommunications jargon. Eyes glaze over when the experts starttrying to define the word &quot;modem&quot; by plunging into adiscussion of something called &quot;modulation&quot; (from which thefirst syllable of &quot;modem&quot; is derived.)   That won't happen here. Trust me; you don't need to knowabout modulation to buy or use a modem. Instead, think of amodem as a telephone for your computer, a specialized phonethat is designed to send computerized data -- such as textand graphics -- instead of human voices, over phone lines.That's the only basic concept you need.   When you set out to buy a modem, there are two main issuesto consider: style and speed. Modems come in two styles.Internal modems are naked circuit boards-sheets of siliconcovered with chips and other parts -- that fit into a slotinside a computer. They need no cables to connect to thecomputer and draw their electrical power from the computer.   External modems pack the same circuitry into a little boxthat sits on the desk and plugs into an electrical outlet.They connect to the computer through a cable that fits into astandard socket called a serial port on the back of thecomputer.   Both kinds of modems have at least one modular phone jack.You can connect them to your regular phone line, but beforewarned: Modem sessions can prevent callers from gettingthrough, and data can be disrupted if someone picks up thephone during a modem session.   There are lots of advantages to internal modems: fewercables, and no need to give up desk space, electrical outletsor a serial port, which can be left free for other types ofadd-on equipment. But some people prefer external modemsbecause they don't require you to fool around inside thecomputer and often feature indicator lights that can tell youat a glance the status of a call.   The other major issue is the speed with which a modem cantransmit data over phone lines. This is measured in bits --the smallest unit of computer data per second, or bps. Themost commonly available modems are rated at 1,200, 2,400 or9,600 bps. (These ratings are also often expressed in termsof &quot;baud&quot; rather than bps, but the numbers are the same.)   Speed matters. The faster you can send or receive data,the less you'll pay in phone bills and connection fees tocommercial services, which often charge by the minute. Butthe fastest modems carry a steep price premium.   For the vast majority of users, a 2,400 bps modem is thebest choice. A good one can be had for under $200. Mostcommercial and corporate databases now run at 2,400 bps orslower. The 9,600 bps models often cost $500 to $1,000, andonly run at top speed when you call another 9,600 bps modem.Still, if you routinely exchange large amounts of data withanother 9,600 bps modem or are trying to link up remotelywith another PC, the extra cost may be worth it.   Some modems also can send documents from your computerscreen to fax machines. They often cost only $50 or $100more.   Modems are becoming mass-market items, but steer away fromthe very cheapest models and the most obscure brands. Thereare too many quality brands to list here, but some major oneswith competitive prices are U.S. Robotics, PracticalPeripherals and Zoom Telephonics.   Make sure your modem is &quot;Hayes-compatible,&quot; meaning itresponds to a standard set of commands popularized by HayesMicrocomputer Products, a big modem maker. Most are. Makesure as well that the modem can automatically dial and answerphone calls. Most now can. But the average user can ignoremost of the costly special features modem makers promote,such as circuitry to correct transmission errors or compressdata.   What you can't ignore is software. The final value of yourmodem purchase will depend on getting a communicationsprogram that's both sophisticated and easy to use. Manymodems come bundled with simple software, but I can recommendespecially two commercial programs: ProComm Plus, byDatastorm, for IBM-compatibles, which sells for about $65,and MicroPhone II (about $215), by Software Ventures, forApple's Macintosh computers and those IBM-compatibles thatuse Microsoft's Windows program. Both will hide the modem'scomplexity behind simple commands and screen displays thatwill let you roam the world by phone from your desk.</TEXT></DOC>
