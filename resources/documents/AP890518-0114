SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The water in the world's oceans appears to berising a tenth of an inch per year, a change that could indicatethat the planet is indeed warming up, a pair of Canadianresearchers reported Thursday.   Scientists concerned about possible climate warming caused bythe so-called ``Greenhouse '' effect have said that one likelyresult would be rising sea levels as the polar ice caps melt.   But detailed evidence has been lacking, with sea levelsapparently rising in some areas and falling in others.   Now W.R. Peltier and A.M. Tushingham of the University ofToronto report in the journal Science that they have calculated anaverage sea level rise of 2.4 millimeters annually over the lastcentury or so. That's about a tenth of an inch per year.   ``Our analyses should not be construed as proof that globalclimate warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect (or someother uinknown cause) is occurring,'' they cautioned in the journalpublished by the American Association for the Advancement ofScience.   ``It would not be surprising, however, if the direct action ofthe expected enhancement of the greenhouse effect were firstobserved through an indirect response such as an increase in globalsea level,'' they added.   Overall warming of the waters that cover about three-fourths ofthe planet could account for about 25 percent of the rising seas,since warmer water expands and takes up more space than colderwater, Tushingham and Peltier noted.   But most of the change seems likely to be a result of melting ofthe ice caps on Antarctica and Greenland, they reported.   Measuring changes in global climate is a complex task andresearchers tend to disagree about the results. Weather variesconsiderably from day to day and year to year, making it hard todetect trends over time.   For example, while some researchers contend temperature recordsshow a global warming over the last century, others say that theapparent rise was caused by city growth around weather stationsraising local readings, or other special circumstances.   In trying to sort out the sea levels, Peltier and Tushinghamnoted that a problem is caused by the fact that the massive sheetsof the last ice age pressed down on land areas in the NorthernHemisphere.   Even today, thousands of years later, some land areas continueto gradually ``rebound'' from that pressure, with the rising landmaking coastal tide gauges appear to show falling water.   The researchers averaged reports from tide gauges around theworld in an effort to filter out local effects such as rising landlevels.   They then calculated that, on average, sea levels are rising 2.4millimeters annually, give or take 0.9 millimeter.   ``The rate of (relative sea level) rise is strongly suggestiveof the action of ongoing glacier and ice sheet melting,'' theyconcluded.   The greenhouse effect has attracted widespread attentionrecently, with scientists concerned that if the planet does warm,droughts will occur, major farming areas will be damaged and otherchanges in society will result.   The term greenhouse effect is used because the increasing levelsof carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere allow sunlightto warm the planet but reduce the amount of balancing warmthradiated back into space, somewhat in the way a greenhouse trapswarmth inside.</TEXT></DOC>
