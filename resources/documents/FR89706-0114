Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerningthe purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed anycomments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statementsmay be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD hasprepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of themost significant aspects of such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule ChangeThe Automated Confirmation Transaction service is designed to facilitatecomparison and clearing of inter-dealer over-the counter (``OTC'') equitytrades by requiring input of trade reports within specific time frames,comparing that trade data, and submitting matched, ``locked-in'' tradesto clearing. Participation in ACT will be mandatory for all NASD broker-dealersthat are clearing or comparison members of a clearing agency registeredpursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or thathave a clearing or comparison arrangement with such a firm. ACT has threeprimary features: (1) Match processing, that will compare trade informationand submit locked-in trades for regular way settlement to clearing on atrade date or next day (``T+1'') basis; (2) trade reporting for transanctionsin national market system (``NMS'') securities that must be reported pursuantto the National Market System Securities Designation Plan with Respectto NASDAQ Securities; and (3) risk management features that will providefirms with a centralized, automated environment for assessment of marketexposure during and after the trading day and that will permit clearingfirms to monitor and respond to the on-going trading activities of theircorrespondents.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>The back office problems experienced by the securities industry in comparingtrades and submitting trade reports to clearing agencies following theOctober 1987 market break highlighted the need for same day automated comparisonprocedures. In the over-the-counter market, the rate of uncompared tradesrose from an average of 5% to 12% in the month of October and NASDAQ, alongwith the exchanges, closed the market two hours early from October 23 throughOctober 30 in order to allow broker-dealers the time needed to alleviateback office work. The Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, thestaff of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Working Group onFinancial Markets, as part of their extensive analyses of the causes andeffects of the October 1987 market break, recognized the potential dangersin today's procedures for comparing and clearing trades and focused onmeasures necessary to expedite the process.\1\<NOTE/> Specifically, in its <T3>Report on the 1987 Market Break</T3>, the Commission's Division ofMarket Regulation found that ``while the securities industry deserves praisefor its fast resolution of an unprecedented number of uncompared trades,the Division staff believes that the NYSE and the NASD should consideraccelerating their efforts . . . to generate same day compared trades,thereby enabling members to know their positions and market exposure beforetrading commences the next day.'' \2\<NOTE/> The Commission reiterated the Division's findings, and intestimony before Congress, the Chairman of the Commission stated that,among other things, efficient markets will require same-day, floor derivedcomparison.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms</T3>,Study VI (January, 1988); <T3>The October 1987 Market Break</T3>, a report by the Division of MarketRegulation, Chapter 10 (February 1988), (hereinafter <T3>Division Report</T3>); and <T3>Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets</T3>, AppendixD (May 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Division Report</T3> p. 10-12, (February 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See</T3>, Securities and Exchange Commission Recommendations regardingthe October 1987 Market Break, Testimony before the State Committee onBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 23-24 (February 3, 1988).In response to the October market break, the Association proposed a numberof initiatives designed to promote more confidence in the operations ofthe market as a whole and, in the clearing area, the proposals were designedto resolve trade comparison discrepancies more quickly. Because of therisks associated with unresolved and late trade comparisons, especiallyin the turbulent October market, as well as the uncertainties inherentin manual trade comparison mechanisms, two of the Association's post Octoberinitiatives included systems to deliver locked-in trades to clearing_theOrder Confirmation Transaction service (``OCT'') and an enhancement tothe Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') requiring mandatory participationfor all NMS market makers. A third proposal was mandatory participationin the Trade Acceptance and Reconciliation Service (``TARS''), a systemapproach of facilitating resolution of trade differences.The Order Confirmation System was developed as a auxiliary medium for memberfirms to communicate with one another to confirm order executions, in responseto real and perceived difficulties encountered in contacting market makersby telephone during the week of October 19.\4\<NOTE/> OCT was designed as an alternative to telephonic communicationand provides participants with a system to communicate and confirm detailsof individual trades. OCT users enter priced orders into the system, andthe system allows participant market makers to accept, reject, or entercounter offers; when a trade is negotiated successfully, the system generatesa confirmation and a locked-in trade is sent to clearing. Necessarily,all members using OCT must maintain appropriate clearing arrangements withregistered clearing agencies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ OTC was approved on a temporary basis in January, 1988,Release No. 34-25263, 53 FR 1430; and permanently approved in May, 1988,Release No. 34-25690, 53 FR 17523.The Commission approved the mandatory SOES rules on June 9, 1988,\5\<NOTE/> and participation in the NASDAQ system as a market makerin NMS securities now requires continuous publication of quotes in thesystem, obligates the market maker to honor SOES executions against thosequotes, and requires membership in a clearing agency (or an access arrangmeentwith a clearing agency member). Trades executed through SOES are locked-inautomatically and forwarded to a registered clearing agency for clearanceand settlement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>Release No. 34-25791, 53 FR 22594.Mandatory TARS, approved in July 1988 \6\<NOTE/> and implemented on June 5, 1989, was designed to augmentmanual trade reconciliation and comparison procedures for nonsystematizedOTC transactions. TARS is an on-line trade reconciliation facility thatallows both parties to an unresolved trade to view, on their NASDAQ terminals,uncompared and advisory OTC transactions that are cleared through the facilitiesof a registered clearing agency and to enter corrections through thoseterminals. The corrections made through the system are transmitted to theclearing agency, thus eliminating the need to transmit separate trade correctiontickets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>Release No. 34-25595, 53 FR 13370.While the OCT and SOES systems generate locked-in trades, and TARS assiststhe trade reconciliation process, the Association developed the ACT systemas the primary vehicle for compressing the comparison cycle, thus reducinginherent risks of market fluctuations for all OTC inter-dealer trades notalready subject to system comparison. The dynamic feature of the ACT systemis capturing trade information in close proximity to execution and lockingthe details of the trade in for submission to clearing. The other attributesof ACT_trade reporting and risk management_are innovative adjuncts to aunified approach to system development. As discussed below, features ofthe trade reporting and risk management applications will enable all NASDowned and operated execution systems to interface with ACT to avoid duplicativeprocessing and to provide firms with the total picture of their marketexposure.The NASD believes that the ACT system is responsive to the recommendationsmade by the Commission following the October 1987 market break and willprovide the OTC market with the safety and certainty of same day comparison,the ability to lock-in trades within minutes after execution, and the capacityto enable members to monitor their positions and market exposure in a livecomputerized environment.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. ACT Processing</ITAG>Today OTC trades that are cleared through a registered clearing agencyare compared by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'')and ACT processed transactions will be submitted to NSCC as locked-in tradeson trade date or T+1. ACT is designed as an on-line and end of day matchingsystem that will allow two participants, usually a market maker and anorder entry firm,\7\<NOTE/> to lock-in details of a trade within minutes of the transaction.Once the two sides have negotiated an OTC transaction, the market makerparticipating in ACT will be obligated to input the details of the trade,including security identification, unit price, quantity, buy or sell, andcontra side_both executing broker and clearing broker, within specifictime frames depending on the security and the method of accessing the system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The ACT system is designed for a ``market maker'' sideand an ``order entry firm'' side for ease of system application and terminology.ACT may of course be used by two market makers or two order entry firms,and the rules applicable to each party to a transaction are set out inthe ACT Operating Rules.Transactions in OTC reportable securities, i.e., round lots of NMS securities,must be reported to ACT within 90 seconds after execution, and the ACTsystem will forward the reports to the NMS high speed tape, the NationalTrade Reporting System. Firms that access the ACT system through computerinterface must report all trades within 90 seconds after execution; firmsthat report to ACT through terminal entry, either Harris, Harris emulationor NASDAQ WorkstationTM, must report NMS trades to ACT within 90 secondsif acting as a selling market maker, and all other trades within 6\1/2\minutes.The order entry side, if a terminal entry firm, may also input detailsof the trade, or utilize the Browse feature of the system and accept ordecline the trade as reported, within the 6\1/2\ minute time frame.Locked-in trades must be guaranteed to settle by the two parties to thetransaction, except that clearing firms that allow their names to be givenup by executing correspondents must also guarantee the trades of thosecorrespondents. The ACT system utilizes three methods to lock-in tradeson trade date: trade by trade match, trade acceptance, or aggregate volumematch. As both sides of the trade are reported to ACT, or one side is reportedand accepted by the other, the ACT system performs on-line match processing,and if all elements match or the trade report has been accepted by theother side, the trade will be locked-in and submitted as such to NSCC atthe end of the day. In addition to matched and accepted trades, Act processingwill run a batch type comparison at the end of each day that will aggregatevolume of previously unmatched trade reports to effect a match. For example,if a market maker enters reports of two trades, 300 shares and 400 sharesof the same stock, same price and same contra side, but the order entryside aggregates the volume and reports one 700 share trade, the tradeswould not match in the trade by trade comparison process because the ``numberof shares'' field in the trade reports are not identical. At the end ofthe day, however, the ACT aggregate volume match cycle will compare theremaining unmatched trade reports, select those in which all the otherdata fields match, aggregate the share volume in the reports, lock thosetrades in and submit them to clearing.Not all trade reports will be processed and locked-in by ACT on trade date.If a trade report has been declined by the order entry side on trade date,the ACT system will delete the report at the end of the day and the tradereport will not be sent to clearing. A participant may decline a tradebecause there is a mistake in the terms reported, and may enter his versionof the transaction into ACT; the market maker also has the opportunityto correct the error that caused the trade to be declined. In addition,any trade report that is ``open'' (unmatched and not declined at the endof trade date processing) will be carried over to T+1 for further processing.ACT matching continues on T+1: trade date reports submitted on T+1 willbe considered ``as-of'' trades and will be accepted for matching; any othercorrection or adjustments to trade date input by the entering party willbe accepted from either side of the transaction. At the end of the T+1cycle, declined trades and open ``as-of'' trades will be removed from thesystem and not forwarded to NSCC.ACT T+1 trade acceptance and end of day matching procedures are similarto those described above for trade date, with one notable exception. Thosetrade date reports that remain open at the end of the T+1 cycle will automaticallybe treated as locked-in trades and sent as such to NSCC. For example, twoACT participants negotiate a trade for 500 shares of XYZ stock at 20\1/2\.The market maker reports the transaction to ACT as 500 shares at 20\1/2\;the order entry side, however, reports the trade to ACT as 500 shares at20\5/8\. Since match by match processing will not lock-in this trade, itwill appear in each party's ACT trade file as an open report on trade dateand on T+1. If neither the market maker nor the order entry side reviewsits open trades on the ACT display and accepts or corrects the open trades,at the end of T+1 processing <T3>both</T3> trades will be treated as locked-in and both participantswill be obligated to clear and settle 1000 shares of XYZ stock. Further,in the example noted above in which one side inputs two trade reports,but the other side aggregates the reports, if one side has input an erroneousnumber, the system will match and aggregate to the extent possible anddisplay any remaining shares to each side as an open report. Take for examplea situation in which there were two trades for 300 and 400 shares, butthe market maker erroneously submits trade reports for 500 and 400 shares,for a total of 900 shares, into the system. The order entry side, believingthe trades to be for 300 and 400 shares, appropriately aggregates the reportsand inputs a trade report of 700 shares into ACT. The end of day aggregatevolume process will match and lock-in 700 shares, but the ACT system willnot display the remaining 200 shares to each participants as an open trade.If neither party declines this report, at the end of T+1, each will beobligated to accept and clear the 200 share trade.Treating open trade reports that were input on trade date at the end ofT+1 processing as locked-in trades is necessary to maintain the integrityof the system and promote the goals of certainty and finality of tradesin the OTC market. Furthermore, ACT has been designed to provide participantswith ample opportunities to review trade details, both intra-day and withend-of-day recaps, and a conscientious participant, using the safeguardsprovided by the system should be caught unaware and obligated for multipletrade reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Tape Reporting and Risk Management</ITAG>The ACT Rules will require participants to report tape reportable NMS tradesto the system within 90 seconds after execution, and the system will transmitthe appropriate trade reports, i.e., internalized and inter-dealer NMStrades of round lots, to the NASDAQ/NMS High speed tape. The ACT Rulesin no way abolish or abrogate any of the obligations of market makers orreporting members as defined in Schedule D, Part XII, Reporting Transactionsin NASDAQ National Market System Designated Securities, except to the extentthat participants in ACT will not be obligated to report NMS transactionsto two systems. Transactions not reported within 90 seconds after executionshall be reported as late, and the ACT system will transmit the late reportsto the high speed tape. In addition, although the NMS reporting rules permitaggregation of trade reports in certain circumstances,\8\<NOTE/> the ACT system can only match aggregated reports of transactionswith the same contra party. Therefore, if a market maker wishes to aggregateall reports of orders received prior to the opening for tape reportingpurposes, he would later be required to amend the reports and distinguishthe contra sides for ACT purposes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See </T3>Schedule D, Part XII, Section 2(f).The ACT system offers several risk management features that should enhancefirms' back office operations. First, the ACT system has the capacity tocompute the dollar value of each trade report entered, thus enabling firmsto assess their market exposure during the trade day, if the firm choosesto access ACT through computer interface. Second, even without computerinterface, ACT participants will be able to review the details of eachtrade entered into the system naming their firm as a party to the trade,so that the day's trading is available for review and analysis. Third,clearing firms will, for the first time through ACT, be able to assessdynamically their ultimate market exposure by having the ability to monitortheir correspondents' positions, both intra-day and after trading hours.Further, to be responsive to clearing firms' concerns regarding immediateliability for correspondent activity in a lock-in trading environment,the Association has developed numerous facilities that will provide themwith enhanced risk management capabilites;(a) Clearing firms will be able to establish daily threshold dollar amountsfor each correspondent's trading activity;(b) The system will alert clearing firms with a correspondent approaches(at 80%) and reaches the daily threshold;(c) The system will provide clearing firms with intra-day access to correspondents'transactions as well as an end of day recap; and(d) The system will provide clearing firms the ability to remove themselvesfrom a clearing arrangement at any time.In addition to these risk management applications, the Association hasdeveloped a ``single trade limit'' feature that establishes a 15 minutereview period for clearing firms prior to becoming obligated to clear atrade of $1,000,000 or more executed by one of its correspondents. Thisfeature allows a clearing firm 15 minutes to decide whether to accept ordecline clearing obligations for a large trade and was designed as an additionalrisk management tool to give clearing firms an opportunity to limit theirliability for large locked-in trades. The Association believes that therisk management features of the ACT system preserve the integrity of a``floor'' derived, same day comparison system, while at the same time offerprotections and opportunities for clearing firms to perform risk managementanalyses unsurpassed in today's marketplace.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Implementation of ACT</ITAG><T3>a. Eligible Securities. </T3>Securities eligible for inclusion in theACT system will be phased in over a long range implementation schedule.Phase 1 will include all NASDAQ securities, NMS and regular NASDAQ, broughton to the system alphabetically as operational considerations permit. Phase2 will add listed securities traded in the third market. Planning for phases3 and 4 for ACT eligible securities include, respectively, non-NASDAQ stockscleared by a registered clearing agency and all other OTC equity securities,for comparison purposes only. During all phases of ACT implementation,the securities available for actual inclusion in the system will be addedon a gradual basis, consistent with the system's operational considerations.The Association has no specific timetable for phasing in eligible securities,but will proceed at a pace designed to accommodate the participants andthe system's capabilities, and will update the Division of Market Regulationstaff periodically as to the status of each phase of implementation.<T3>b. Eligible Participants. </T3>Although participation in ACT is mandatoryfor all NASD members that are members of a registered clearing agency orthat have a clearing arrangement with such a member, the system has beendesigned to support firms that may not be immediately capable of participatingin ACT when it becomes operational or that may, from time to time, experienceoperational difficulties. These various stages of readiness are identifiedin the system as ``availability states:''(1) Not Ready, where a firm is not yet an ACT Participant (e.g., firmsthat intend to access ACT through computer interface, but whose programmingmay not be completed);(2) Unavailable, where an ACT Participant is temporarily unable to participatedue to technical malfunctions; and(3) Available, where the firm is an ACT Participant and all ACT rules andprocedures apply.A firm's ability to interact with the system will determine the scope ofits participation. For example, a Not Ready firm, while it is unable toenter trade reports into ACT, may be able to view the trades entered bycontra parties naming it as a party to the trade, but the system will notlock-in any such trade. Instead, ACT will submit a one-sided trade reportto NSCC at the end of trade date processing on behalf of the firm thatmade the ACT entry, and NSCC will handle that trade report as it does today,without the Association's identifying it as a locked-in ACT trade. A firmthat is Unavailable for ACT processing will also be protected from automaticprocessing; at the end of the T+1 cycle, the open trades entered againstan Unavailable firm will not be locked-in, as described above, but willbe sent to NSCC as one-sided trade reports. Available firms will of coursebe able to participate in all of the ACT system's features and will beobligated to abide by the rules and procedures of the system.c. <T3>Interaction With Other NASD Systems. </T3>As an independent system,ACT was designed initially to compare trade reports and lock-in tradesfor submission to clearing. Because the membership and the Board decidedto make participation in ACT mandatory for firms with clearing arrangements,and because the tape reporting and risk management applications were integratedinto the system, ACT necessarily interacts with many other automated systems.For example, all SOES market makers in National Market System securitiesare required to maintain a clearing arrangement with a registered clearingagency and may be penalized with a 20 day suspension for an unexcused withdrawalfrom NASDAQ. But, if a market maker loses its clearing arrangement becauseof some activity in ACT, it will be removed from the ACT system and necessarilyfrom NASDAQ/NMS until another clearing arrangement is made. Regardlessof the time needed to establish another clearing arrangement, the marketmaker would face the 20 day suspension because of the SOES Rules and ScheduleD. The Uniform Practice Committee recommended, and the Board approved,an exception to the 20 day penalty so that a market maker that loses itsclearing arrangement in ACT would not be penalized in NASDAQ. The ACT Rulesand the proposed amendment to the SOES Rules and Schedule D would thereforeallow a market maker to be reinstated in NASDAQ when a clearing arrangementhas been reestablished.One of the back office features available through ACT is the maintenanceof a net amount traded file for each executing broker. Every applicablenon-systematized inter-dealer OTC equity transaction will be reported toACT and the system has the capacity to track each firm's activity, therebyoffering an on-line risk management monitoring capability as well as offeringclearing firms an overview of their correspondents' market activity atany given moment. In order to be truly effective for clearing firms, however,correspondent trades that are occurring in SOES and OCT and in the MSI'sAdvanced Computerized Execution System (``ACES''), are planned to be interfacedwith the ACT system software so that those trades will also be reflectedin the firm's net amount traded balances.Once ACT is fully operational, the need for TARS will be reduced. The Associationanticipates, however, that TARS will be used for other than regular-waysettlements, such as cash, seller's option or next-day settlement, forprocessing as-of or withholds entered after T+1, and for non-ACT members,i.e., members of the NASD that do not maintain a clearing arrangement witha registered clearing agency, or clear through such a member. TARS, therefore,will remain accessible to members and any necessary filings regarding changesin the status of TARS will be made with the Commission at that time.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Participant Obligations in ACT</ITAG>Pursuant to Article VII, sections 1(a) (6) and (7) of the By-Laws of theAssociation, the Board has determined that participation in ACT is mandatoryfor all broker-dealers that are members of a clearing agency registeredwith the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the section 17Aof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and for all broker-dealers thathave a clearing arrangement with such a member. Participation in ACT isconditioned upon execution of a participant application agreement, promptpayment of fees for the service, and compliance with rules and requirementsof the system. ACT participants shall be obligated to accept and cleareach transaction that the system identifies as having been effected bythe party, as a principal to the trade, until such time as the participantis removed from the system. The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is found in section 15A(b)(6)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, section 15A(b)(6)requires that the Association's rulemaking initiatives be designed to fostercooperation and coordination with persons engaged in clearing, settlingand facilitating transactions in securities. As described in detail above,the ACT system will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlementof trades by performing the comparison automatically and transmitting locked-intrades to the clearing agency.B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThe Association believes that the proposed rule change does not imposeany burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance ofpurposes of the Act. Although use of the ACT system will be mandatory formembers with an access arrangement with a registered clearing agency, thebenefits of ACT, increasing the efficiency of post trade comparison andreducing the length of time that investors and members are exposed to marketrisk from uncompared trades, outweigh any potential competitive burden.C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants or OthersGeneral membership comments on ACT were neither solicited nor received;however, the Association did solicit comments on a proposed amendment tothe NASD By-Laws authorizing the NASD to require the reporting of tradeinformation by members conducting an inter-dealer over-the-counter business.These comments were reviewed by the Commission and the By-Law was approvedin October, 1988.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See </T3>Release No. 34-25215, 53 FR 43958.<ITAG tagnum="85">III.
