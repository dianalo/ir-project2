But it isn't true the response will always be negative.   No mystery there; millions of small companies wouldn't existwithout banks, which usually control the wherewithal for starting abusiness. One study found 45 percent of all small-business foundersused money from commercial lenders.   That said, those intense feelings often are critical, amongother reasons because of what are perceived to be high rates, fees,collateral requirements that involve personal guarantees, andcookie-cutter bank products.   Sampling small business is a frustrating task, partly because itas a whole is so large and diverse. More than 17 million federaltax returns in 1985 contained business income and about 99 percentof all businesses are considered small.   Even that doesn't tell the whole story. Most small businessesare very small, with nearly 60 percent of them employing only oneto four people. No less than 90 percent of small businesses havefewer than 20 employees.   Economists working for the National Federation of IndependentBusiness foundation did manage to get a fair sampling of opinion,however, but only after soliciting and examining responses from7,970 small-business owners.   Summarizing them, the economists concluded that ``no businessrelationship seems to draw more strong and divergent opinion fromsmall-business men and women than the relationship with bankers.''   Respondents were very concerned about those interest rates.``They feel the rates charged them are excessive, particularlycompared to the rates charged the `best corporate customers.'''   The NFIB economists say the small guys have a point. ``Manysmall-business customers after all are the best corporate customersin everything but size.'' But when banks think of ``best,'' theeconomists say, they often mean big.   Those high rates might also be even higher through the use offees and service charges, which appear to be on the increase.Sometimes, say the small-business customers, they don't even knowwhat the fees are for.   Thus, the authors conclude, ``the capacity of banks to readilyobfuscate basic fee questions _ purposefully or not _ leaves uneasyfeelings,'' and greatly limit the customer's ability to makebanking comparisons.   Healthy earnings, the authors say, have muted this problemtemporarily. ``But should inflation return or earnings dissipate,small-business demands for lower interest rates and schemes toobtain them will be enormous.''   Concern over collateral requirements, most of which involvedassignment of the borrower's home, was second only to interestrates. The high level of concern perplexed the economists, becausepersonal-resource assignment isn't new.   Seeking an answer, the economists found the greatest concernseemed to be in urban areas, leading them to surmise that rurallenders based decisions on direct, local, personal knowledge not aseasily available to city lenders.   The irritation over cookie-cutter banking is more understandable.   Great diversity within the small-business population impliesthat they also need a diversity of borrowing conditions _ infinitecombinations of interest charges, fees, collateral requirements andmaturity dates, for example.   Alas, it isn't so. The study found that with authority oftenremoved from the local branch office, the only thing available tothe local borrower is a sort of a care package from the mainoffice, with no exceptions tolerated.   The result, it concludes, is an added area of tension, this onebetween the small-business need for individualized borrowing andthe banks' insistence on greater uniformity.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv AMs Saturday, Oct. 7.</NOTE></DOC>
