<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0500 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experiment was performed on the critical assembly of the Central ResearchInstitute for Physics in Budapest, Hungary, to test a mathematical modelof boiling detection using the noise method. A test section, which isdescribed in detail, was placed in the reactor core. The boiling conditionswere modelled in a glass tube, the temperature course was detected usingthermocouples. Bubbles were checked visually. Neutron characteristicswere determined with a number of neutron detectors placed at differentheights and on different radii of the core. The measured values wererecorded on magnetic tape. They were evaluated using a PDP computer linkedto a CAMAC system. The most important results of the experiment are showngraphically. They are in good agreement with calculations based on thetest mode. (Z.M.) 10 figs., 1 tab., 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
