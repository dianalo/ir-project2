An investigationhas been carried out to determine the mechanisms of material loss ofsteels containing from 2 1/4 to 25 wt.% chromium in various erosion-corrosiontest environments. The laboratory test results compared favorably withthe behavior of the same alloys in an atmospheric fluidized bed combustor.It was determined that metal loss resulting from the impact of roundedAl/sub 2/O/sub 3/ erodent particles was a function of the erosive behaviorof the scales which formed on the alloys while metal loss from the impactof angular SiC particles was primary a metal erosion mechanism. The Al/sub2/O/sub 3/ particles striking the growing scale changed their composition,morphology and the mechanisms by which they were removed. As the chromiumcontent of the steels was increased, their metal loss rates decreasedfor both Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and SiC particle erosion-corrosion with thesteels with andgt;9 wt.% Cr having similar metal loss rates.</TEXT></DOC>
