Uno, who previously denied the report to journalists, said hewould not comment on it in a public forum.   The report surfaced last weekend in the Sunday Mainichi magazine,which broke with Japanese journalism tradition by publishing orbroadcasting reports on such liaisons by government officials.   The magazine's story was not picked up at first by majornewspapers or national television. But the question on the issue inthe upper house of the Diet, Japan's parliament, was reported byKyodo News Service and on the evening television news by JapanBroadcasting Corp.   Socialist Manae Kubota, an activist on women's rights, posed Unoa three-pronged question: why were there no women in the Cabinet heformed last Friday; what did he think about prostitution; andbecause the Washington Post had published an article on theallegation that he had kept a geisha mistress, ``if it's not true,you should clearly protest.''   Uno replied only: ``I will refrain from commenting publicly onsuch a kind of report concerning myself.''   Miss Kubota later told The Associated Press she brought up thequestion because she thought the geisha story reflected badly on theprime minister's integrity and Japan's image.   ``It is true that an affair of that sort is often tolerated inJapanese society. However, I firmly believe the prime ministershould quit if the scandal was true,'' she said.   Uno, 66, took office a week ago in the midst of a bribery scandalthat forced the resignation of his predecessor, Noboru Takeshita.   Uno's main qualifications were that he was believed free ofscandal and that his experience as foreign minister would serveJapan well at a time of trade tensions and during the summit thissummer of the seven industralized democracies.   But he is not regarded as a strong politician, and some analystsdoubt he will last more than a few months as his long-governingLiberal Democratic Party sorts itself out in the wake of the Recruitbribery scandal.   Miss Kubota said she felt Uno may not be fit to represent Japanabroad. ``Buying prostitutes isn't tolerated in internationalsociety,'' she said.   The Sunday Mainichi article quoted an unidentified 40-year-oldwoman as saying Uno had paid her $2,100 a month over a four-monthperiod in 1985.   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' the article quoted thewoman as saying. ``I don't want him to use politics the same way hetreated me.''   Geishas are women highly trained in music, dance and makingconversation. While they are not prostitutes, some develop intimaterelationships with customers who become their patrons, and in Japanit has long been considered not unusual for wealthy and powerful mento have such relations.   Uno, however, denied the liaison when asked by reporters earlythis week.   Gregory Clark, professor of Japan studies at Sophia University,said it may have been the first time a prime minister was askeddirectly about such a relationship in the Diet.   Clark thought the issue has arisen in Japan partly because of adescent to what he called ``gutter journalism.''   But Shuntaro Torigoe, editor in chief of the Sunday Mainichi,said he published the article because he wanted to bring issues ofsocial ethics into the public arena.   ``We also want Americans, who are critical of politicians, toknow that in Japan we are changing,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
