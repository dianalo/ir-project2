Using thistechnique in situ measurements even in inhomogeneous radiation fieldshave become possible. Secondly the absorption caused by particles canbe separated from that by gas. Thus the two major deficiencies of theflux divergence method have been overcome. The authors developed theirmethod because of the poor knowledge about the role of the atmosphericparticulate matter in the global annual mean radiation budget and aboutthe absorption process in general.</TEXT></DOC>
