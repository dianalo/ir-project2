I've even heardthe flattering suggestion that I'm the French Mrs. Thatcher]&quot;   Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot S.A., is talking againabout his favorite subject: Keeping Japanese cars out ofEurope.</LP><TEXT>   His repeated outcries have helped push French, Spanish andItalian authorities to toughen their stands on Japaneseimports. And the combative, 59-year-old executive, iswielding more clout than his critics would like.   France's success in blocking a compromise plan theEuropean Community commission negotiated with Japaninfuriated EC Industrial Affairs Commissioner MartinBangemann. The EC plan, which was supposed to take effectJan. 1, would have ended European quotas on Japanese carsales by 1998 -- too fast for Mr. Calvet.   His demands are clear. He wants Japan's European marketshare -- including cars made in the U.S. and Britain --frozen at current levels until at least 2003. He wantsexisting national quotas maintained, including the onelimiting Japan to 3% of France's auto market. He wants afreeze on building new Japanese-owned factories in Europe,and even a rethinking of the European Community's reason forexistence.   No one expects him to get nearly that much. Even theFrench government regularly feuds with him on this and otherissues. But it is clear why he fears Japan: He has a gooddeal of catching up to do before he can make cars asefficiently as his Japanese competition. His pressure forcontinued protection from Japan has helped force Frenchofficials to take a harder line than the relativelyfree-market EC commission.   In an interview, Mr. Calvet says that, if he doesn'tpersuade EC authorities to adopt his views, he may run forpolitical office himself. He doesn't say what office he mightseek.   Whatever course he follows, his pet issue is central tothe future of the European auto market, which the Japanesehave only begun to attack. Automobiles today representEurope's biggest industry and biggest employer. Taken as awhole, the EC is the world's largest auto market. Mr. Calvetfeels that he is forcing a reluctant Europe to avoid the samemistakes the U.S. has made with the Japanese. His critics --who far outnumber his supporters -- feel he is a pest.   The British are enraged at his October statement thatBritain, which has welcomed Japanese auto factories, hasbecome &quot;a Japanese aircraft carrier just off Europe's coast,or even Japan's fifth major island.&quot; His contempt for ECpolicy so infuriates Mr. Bangemann that he refused to inviteMr. Calvet to his two dinners with other European auto makerslast autumn.   Other European auto company chiefs, who want to compromiseon quotas, became so exasperated with Mr. Calvet's stancethat they all resigned last autumn from the Europeanindustry's lobbying association, and formed their own withoutPeugeot. They now are proposing their own compromise plan,only slightly tougher than the EC's original one. Mr. Calvetis barely on speaking terms with Renault Chairman RaymondLevy, who leads the new lobby and is willing to form jointventures with the Japanese.   Some auto consultants warn that, by sheltering Peugeotfrom its harshest competition now, Mr. Calvet risks beingdecimated when real Japanese competition finally arrives.Peugeot, which hasn't managed to eliminate its debt andremains dependent on the depressed French and Spanish automarkets, is particularly vulnerable to the current autoindustry recession, the consultants say.   The criticism clearly stings, but Mr. Calvet refuses tobudge.   With Japan, Mr. Calvet is taking on his toughest foe ever.He says its cultural, social and economic practices give itan unfair advantage that companies like his need at least 10more years to overcome. If the Japanese are allowed tocompete freely in Europe, he maintains, companies likePeugeot risk simply disappearing.   Underpinnings of his view can be found at his mainproduction plant, in a town called Sochaux next to the Swissborder. There, Peugeot is racing to catch Japan. It still hasa long way to go.   Inside the plant, some buildings date from 1912. Mr.Calvet is embarked on a 10 billion franc ($1.86 billion)project to jump from the outmoded mass-production facility heinherited to a new Japanese-style system, just over half-wayin place. He has a new spanking-white paint shop that Peugeotclaims is so dust-free and automated that Japanese executiveskeep visiting it.   But although the paint shop has been running since 1989and is meant to be fully automated, it still has a few&quot;temporary&quot; humans on the line, painting in places themachines still don't manage to reach.   Independent auto consultants say Peugeot has made hugestrides in the past five years, but that it isn't moving asrapidly as companies such as Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AGto resolve these kinds of handicaps.   &quot;The truth of the matter is Peugeot is way down the list{of the best European car companies},&quot; says Donald Kress, anauto consultant who has advised almost every European automaker including Peugeot. &quot;If the question is, are theyproducing state-of-the-art cars, latest design, top quality,the answer is no. That doesn't mean they don't produce areasonable product. But finishing fourth {among Europe's sixbiggest producers} doesn't win you the horse race.&quot;   West Germany's main motorists' club, Adac, comparesdifferent cars' breakdown rates, based on members' calls foraid. In the latest survey, published last May, Peugeot didterribly. Its 205 model finishes 10th of 11 small cars --ahead only of the Fiat Uno. In the mid-size category,Peugeot's 405 is 12th of 14, and Citroen's BX (also made byPeugeot) is 14th. The Japanese finish at the top.   Peugeot acknowledges that it hasn't fully mastered two ofthe fundamental requirements of a modern auto manufacturingsystem: That each worker be responsible for his own quality,and that errors be corrected immediately, rather than afterthe product is completed.   Mr. Calvet says he is moving ahead rapidly, but thatbringing a company back from near-bankruptcy takes time.Productivity is up 50% over the past five years, he says,&quot;and to the dismay of my associates, I've given them the goalof another 50% over the next five years.&quot;   Mr. Calvet insists the quality of Peugeot cars now comingoff assembly lines is among the best in Europe. He explainsstudies like Adac's by saying Peugeot quality indeed wasinferior once, and that many of those cars still are on theroad.   Mr. Calvet warns that if Europe doesn't give itselfanother decade to prepare for unfettered Japanesecompetition, European companies will lose market share assharply as U.S. concerns did.   &quot;Everyone thinks that the Japanese will represent 30% or31% {of the U.S. market} in 1991, and I won't hide the factthat two high officials of Ford and General Motors told methat they are convinced that the Japanese will have 40% ofthe U.S. market within three years. Forty percent. Alarming,isn't it?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
