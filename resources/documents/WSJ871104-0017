Despite his troubles, though, the usually tight-lipped Mr. Holmes a Court is hinting he is more inclined to buy than sell.    The price collapse has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars off the market capitalization of Mr. Holmes a Court's major listed companies, Bell Group Ltd. and Bell Resources Ltd. An announcement early last week that Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. was withdrawing as lead manager of a one billion-Australian-dollar ($679 million) bond issue for Bell Resources, which was to have reduced the company's interest bill, has further shaken investor confidence.    Though prices of both Bell companies recovered slightly this week in a stronger Australian stock market, the two are significantly below their 1987 peaks. Moreover, prices have fallen far more than the market average and than several other high-flying entrepreneurial stocks. Alan Bond's Bond Corp., John Elliott's Elders IXL Ltd., Australian-born Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Larry Adler's FAI Insurances Ltd., for instance, haven't been hit nearly as hard.    Mr. Holmes a Court, who earlier this year became Australia's first billionaire, has watched his personal wealth sag; some estimates put his paper losses at more than $600 million.    Mr. Holmes a Court controls about 45% of Bell Group, which, in turn, owns 42.5% of Bell Resources. Bell Group closed yesterday at 3.05 Australian dollars, down 73% from its 1987 peak of 11.30 dollars. Since Oct. 19, when the world stock crash began, the price of Bell Group stock has plunged 69%, nearly twice as fast as the 36% decline in the All Ordinaries index.    Bell Resources shares have also tumbled, closing yesterday at 1.67 dollars -- 79% below the year's high of eight dollars and 67% below on its pre-crash price.    Investor speculation has focused on Bell Resources, and its biggest assets -- a 30% stake in Broken Hill Proprietary Co. and 10% in Texaco Inc. (BHP is Australia's biggest company in terms of market capitalization; the big U.S. oil concern is currently in bankruptcy proceedings.)    Because many of Bell Resources' assets are stakes in other listed companies, which provide dividends but no access to cash flow, investors are speculating that the Great Acquirer, as Mr. Holmes a Court is known, is heading for a cash squeeze in 1988. &quot;The group is asset-rich but isn't obtaining a high operating cash flow from its assets,&quot; said John Bartley, an analyst at Potter Partners, a Melbourne-based brokerage.    While Bell Resources' 1987 pretax earnings of about 400 million dollars should be enough to cover this year's interest bill, which some analysts expect to exceed 200 million dollars on debt of more than 3.6 billion dollars, next year could tell a different story. If share prices remain depressed, profits from stock-trading operations -- a big contributor to earnings -- aren't likely to be as buoyant. That is putting pressure on Mr. Holmes a Court either to reduce his debt load through sales of assets or to acquire a cash cow.    Ian Story, an analyst at BZW Meares in Sydney, estimated Bell Resources' 1988 interest bill at 300 million dollars and the company's earnings, based on its current structure without any share-trading profits, at 248 million dollars. He said the proposed Merrill Lynch bond issue would have trimmed the 1988 interest bill by about 80 million dollars before tax.    Despite all this, Mr. Holmes a Court has indicated he will use his ample access to credit to shop around for yet more acquisitions. In the just-released Bell Group annual report, written after the Oct. 19 crash, he seeks to reassure shareholders that he is still on the prowl. Bell has &quot;held substantial lines of credit in place over the last 12 months which will allow us to actively pursue our goals,&quot; he says.    Already, rumors are swirling in the stock market about what Mr. Holmes a Court may go after next. Speculation is that Bell Group, whose holdings include media, gold and insurance interests, will seek the rest of Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd., an Australian building-products and resources group in which Bell acquired a 17% interest in August. A cash bid probably would have to be made at four dollars a share and would cost Bell Group about two billion dollars.    As for Bell Resources, some analysts think it unlikely Mr. Holmes a Court will put up the eight billion dollars needed to acquire the remaining shares.    Abroad, BZW Meares's Mr. Story said Mr. Holmes a Court may shed some British holdings. Bell Group's 15% stake in Standard Chartered PLC may be put on the block, providing Mr. Holmes a Court could recoup his investment, originally 340 million dollars.    But he might bid for the British retailer Sears PLC -- paying an estimated three billion dollars to acquire the 92% he doesn't already own -- and sell Sears's low-yielding property interests, some analysts said. A full bid for Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the British investment bank, could also be in the wings. Mr. Story also said Mr. Holmes a Court might be looking for a buyer for his Texaco stake, though he doesn't think the Australian investor would take a loss. He paid an average $37 a share; Texaco fell $3.25 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to close at $31, one day after the Texas Supreme Court affirmed Pennzoil Co.'s $10.3 billion judgment against the company.    Those who have been on the other side of transactions with Mr. Holmes a Court, however, warn of red herrings. &quot;The only thing predictable about Robert is when he's normally trying to indicate one thing, he's going to do another,&quot; said an investment banker. </TEXT></DOC>
