(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former PTL board member testifiedThursday he didn't know about hush money paid Jessica Hahn until twomonths before Bakker quit the television ministry over the sex andmoney scandal.   ``I never knew the name Jessica Hahn until January 1987,'' ErnieFranzone of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said at Bakker's federal trial onfraud and conspiracy charges.   Other testimony centered on cash flow problems at the ministry,including problems at its flagship hotel at the same time Bakker wasinsisting on such touches as a $15,000 chandelier, despite millionsof dollars that were pledged daily.   PTL paid Ms. Hahn $265,000 in 1985 to keep quiet about her sexualencounter with Bakker on Dec. 6, 1980, at a Florida hotel. Bakkerresigned in March 1987 as PTL chief. The Hahn payment was made byPTL's builder, who then added the amount to his bill.   Bakker, 49, is being tried on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.Prosecutors say Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry fundsobtained from the sale of partnerships in the ministry's hotel tobankroll his extravagant lifestyle.   Thursday's was the first full day of testimony after the trialresumed following Bakker's breakdown and commitment in a federalprison for psychiatric evaluation last week.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter let the trial resume Wednesday,and denied a defense motion for a mistrial after a governmentpsychiatrist that Bakker had suffered a ``panic attack'' last weekbut was competent to stand trial.   Bakker's lawyers asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inRichmond on Thursday to halt Bakker's trial, citing possible grandjury misconduct.   The lawyers claim Ms. Hahn told Charlotte radio station WRFX thatgrand jurors approached her in a courtroom restroom and asked forher autograph during a break in her testimony in September 1987.   Bakker's attorneys contend the grand jurors violated their oathof impartiality. One of the lawyers, Harold Bender, said he had noword on the status of the appeal.   Bakker was composed during Thursday's testimony, taking notes andtalking with his attorneys as witnesses testified. As he left thecourtroom late in the afternoon, Bakker waved to supporters andsaid, ``I'm looking for the weekend.''   Franzone, regional manager of the company that managed Bakker'sHeritage Grand Hotel, said he wouldn't have approved bonuses forBakker, his wife, Tammy, and former PTL Executive Vice PresidentRichard Dortch had he known about Ms. Hahn. Dortch has beensentenced to eight years in prison and fined $200,000 for his guiltyplea to four fraud and conspiracy charges.   ``That would have been the red light for me,'' Franzonetestified. ``I would have taken another look at whether I would havestayed on the board.''   Franzone also said he never remembered voting a bonus for Bakkerof more than $100,000 although the board's minutes show Bakkerfrequently received bonuses double that amount.   But he said he approved bonuses up to $100,000 because ``Ibelieved PTL was in good financial condition. So many things werepositive about PTL. So much was being done so well.''   Franzone also said he never was told that bonuses were usuallydoubled so the recipients could pay the income tax on them.   In other testimony, Lamar Kerstetter, a retired Pennsylvania coalminer, said he purchased a ``Family Fun Partnership'' from PTL inMarch 1987, the same month that Bakker resigned.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Kerstetter what heexpected to get for his $1,000 payment to PTL.   ``My four days and three nights (of free lodging),'' Kerstetterresponded. ``I was buying a product. I was buying lodging and use ofthe park.''   After discovering that the free lodging offer was good only forthe uncompleted Towers Hotel, rather than the ministry's HeritageGrand Hotel in Fort Mill, S.C., Kerstetter asked for a refund. Hesaid he got a letter, dated about the time the ministry filed forbankruptcy, saying he could not get a refund immediately because PTLwas in a ``crucial period in its transition.''   Dana Angel of Atlantic Beach, Fla., and her mother, Lila Angel,89, testified that they jointly bought a lifetime partnership in1986, putting $500 each on their credit cards so she and her mothercould spend a week at the Heritage Grand Hotel.   Lila Angel testified that she enjoyed going to Heritage USA, butthat she expected a return for her money.   ``I worked until I was 77, and I save my pennies. I still do.That $500 was quite a bit of money for me,'' she said.   The prosecution also presented witnesses who testified aboutBakker's buying habits.   Frederick Gunzel, who operates an air charter service, said hewas hired to fly Bakker and his wife, Tammy, from Charlotte to PalmSprings, Calif., and back at a cost of $102,000 in July 1984.   Ron Shue, a salesman for Beck Mercedes in Charlotte, said he soldtwo 1987 Mercedes 560SL sedans to Bakker _ one for $61,191 and theother for $59,000. He said a used 1985 Mercedes station wagon waspurchased for the Bakkers' children at a cost of $28,000.   Earlier, a former PTL bookkeeper testified that during one weekin 1986, PTL raised $17 million and deposited more than $365,000 incash donations.   Delores Jones, who kept the weekly ledger of contributionsbeginning in 1981, said the ministry collected $20,000 in cash fromoffering plates passed at PTL's Sunday services and from theaudience at the ministry's television show.   Ms. Jones said the rest of the $17 million in collections thatweek were from lifetime partnerships that offered contributors threenights of free lodging a year in exchange for $1,000 donations.   The former manager of the 500-room Heritage Grand Hotel testifiedthat he faced cash-flow problems almost from the day the hotelopened in December 1984.   William Maybrey, the general manager of Heritage Grand Hotel fromApril 1984 to December 1985, said Bakker was involved in hotelmanagement after it opened in December 1984, even down to helpingdesign staff uniforms.   Dortch told him not to worry about the cash-flow problems, evenas Bakker was insisting on additional staff members to shorten thereservations line and a $15,000 chandelier for a hotel hallway,Maybrey said.</TEXT></DOC>
