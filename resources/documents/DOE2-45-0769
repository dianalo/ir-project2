Current activity includes work oforganizations operating on both the regional and subregional level; manysuch organizations are intergovernmental, but a significant number ofprivate sector and autonomous organizations are also represented. Theseorganizations cover a wide range of activities, including data developmentand analysis, technology transfer, training, research and development,trade and investment promotion, supply security, and environmental protection.Benefits of cooperation include enhanced information access, increasedeconomies of scale, and benefits to national security, investment, trade,and the environment. These benefits are then compared in this paper tothe programs carried out by existing cooperative organizations. Analysisshows that these existing activities correspond closely to the conceptualrationales for cooperation. It is suggested, however, that additionalactivities could be advantageously developed, such as improvement inforecasting technology, research and development of certain energy technologiesappropriate for the region, and removal of energy trade barriers. Itis also suggested that in expanding energy cooperation, it is best tomatch the objectives of any program to the subset of countries that aremost interested. 4 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
