(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wickes Cos. Inc. agreed today to bebought by two New York investment groups that will pay $517 millionin cash and assume about $2.2 billion in outstanding Wickes' debt.   Announcement of the takeover by Blackstone Capital Partners andWasserstein, Perella Partners follows by 12 days the withdrawal of amanagement-led bid to take the retailing and manufacturingconglomerate private.   Wickes management accepted the investors' bid of $11.25 a share,a discount from the $12 a share offered by a group led by Wickeschairman Sanford Sigoloff in late August and withdrawn Oct. 14.   The investors' bid values Wickes stock at about $517 million.Assumption of debt would bring the total value of the deal to $2.7billion, the companies said in a news release.   Officers of Blackstone and Wasserstein, Perella would becomeco-chairmen of Wickes, apparently displacing Sigoloff, who broughtthe company out of bankruptcy in 1985.   Wickes released a statement from Sigoloff saying the deal wouldbenefit shareholders, but was silent on the executive's future.Wickes spokesman Michael Sitrick refused to discuss Sigoloff'sfuture and said Sigoloff was declining interviews.   Blackstone and Wasserstein, Perella will have equal say indirecting the company, which operates furniture stores and theBuilders Emporium home improvement stores in Southern California andhas groups that make automotive fabrics, wallpaper and aircraftparts.   Co-chairmen will be James R. Birle, 52, a Blackstone partner andformer vice president of General Electric Co., and Robert B. McKeon,34, a managing director of Wasserstein, Perella, the companiesannounced.   Management had been shopping the company around since the Augustmanagement buyout offer, which was designed to draw higher bids.   That tender offer to stockholders by a Sigoloff-led groupincluded an unusual provision delaying any stock purchases for 60days, and specifically left the door open to outside offers.   It was withdrawn Oct. 14, six days before the expiration date.Sigoloff's group attributed the withdrawal to new projections thatWickes' operating income for the year would be $40 million belowwhat had been forecast at the time the offer was made.</TEXT></DOC>
