Sessions were scheduled for mornings and evenings with ampletime for discussion, thus encouraging communication between scientists,from a variety of disciplines, working on problems related to the healtheffects of ionizing radiation. The 1987 conference focused on lung cancerrisks, especially lung cancer risks due to radon. The BEIR IV report,which addresses health risks of radon and other internally depositedalpha-emitters, was summarized early in the conference. Results of analysesof data on miners in Colorado and in New Mexico were presented as wellas analyses of combined data from several studies, which are used asthe basis of estimates in the BEIR IV report. Statistical issues relatedto appropriate analysis of chronic exposure and of smoking data receivedconsiderable attention and discussion. Papers describing models for lungcancer risks based on exposure to cigarette smoke, radiation, and othersubstances provided insights into general understanding of lung cancermechanisms. Carcinogenic models were also the subject of a presentationon radiation-induced skin cancer in humans and animals. In addition,relevant data on animal experiments involving radon exposure were summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
