Seib   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18</SO><CO>   MDEST EUROP</CO><IN>MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)</IN><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Iran probably will provide Iraq with somehelp in circumventing international economic sanctions, butit has powerful reasons not to become a big embargo-buster,analysts inside and outside the U.S. government believe.   Iran may well decide to help Iraq procure some food andother supplies in hopes of winning concessions during talksdesigned to formally end the two countries' bitter eight-yearwar. Moreover, Iran easily could conclude that its broaderinterests are well-served by providing Iraq just enoughrelief to keep the current Persian Gulf crisis bubbling alongunresolved until its Iraqi and American nemeses bloody eachother militarily.</LP><TEXT>   But Iran is likely to put distinct limits on any help. Ithas little interest in giving so much aid that Iraq succeedsin consolidating its hold on oil-rich Kuwait, therebybecoming the clear power of the Persian Gulf and arbiter ofGulf oil politics. And while Iran may not care about angeringthe U.S. by embargo-busting, it probably doesn't want toantagonize Europeans whose technical aid it wants.   Some U.S. officials even suspect Iran is flirting withembargo-busting as a way of extracting a payoff from SaudiArabia and other Gulf states opposed to Iraq.   Iran's intentions have become important to U.S. policy,because Tehran could provide Iraq significant economic reliefif it allows commerce to flow freely back and forth along thecountries' 750-mile border.   American officials say they have little to go on butindirect messages they have received from Iran throughdiplomatic channels. These messages indicate that Iranintends to abide by United Nations Security Councilresolutions banning trade with Iraq.   Iran seems to have tactical reasons to allow some seepageof goods to Iraq -- or to at least keep the West worryingthat it will do so. By simply hinting occasionally that itmay give Iraq some economic relief, Tehran can send the Westa clear reminder of its own strategically important locationand serve notice that the Gulf's future can't be decidedwithout taking Iran into account.   Gary Sick, who was the chief Iranwatcher on PresidentCarter's National Security Council staff, says: &quot;They willuse their embargo-busting as a bargaining chip with theWest.&quot;   Iran's other tactical reasons for considering limitedembargo-busting arise from its complicated relations withIraq. In the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and subsequentshowdown with the international community, Saddam Husseinlast month appeared to accept Iran's terms for a formal peaceand he initiated negotiations on a treaty.   In those negotiations, Iraq appears to have explicitlyoffered to send Iran some of its refined oil products, whichIran needs because of wartime damages to its refineries, inreturn for shipments of food.   Iran may want to play along for the time being. Inparticular, Iran badly wants to win the return of thousandsof prisoners of war held by Iraq but who haven't beenregistered with the Red Cross or returned home under initialprisoner-of-war exchanges.   In addition, Iran may want to stay on good terms with Iraqlong enough to get the Iraqi government to shut down officesof Iranian opposition figures operating in Baghdad.   But Iran's long-term interests suggest it won't want tolink itself closely with Iraq in an economic alliance opposedby much of the outside world. While Iranian hard-linersdislike U.S. policies in the Gulf, those same hard-linersalso have been the most virulently anti-Iraq elements in theIranian government.   It also isn't clear that Iranian public opinion wouldtolerate widespread aid to an Iraqi enemy that killed andwounded tens of thousands of Iranians in recent years.&quot;Iranian public opinion would be scandalized by any show thatthe Iranians are helping the Iraqis,&quot; says Shaul Bakhash, anIranian author and scholar now at George Mason University.   Additionally, embargo-busting may not be a profitableenterprise for the Iranians; Iraq, deeply in debt before theKuwaiti invasion and shut off from oil markets since, doesn'thave much material reward to offer Iran. &quot;The profitabilityof busting the embargo is questionable,&quot; says Robert Hormats,vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.</TEXT></DOC>
