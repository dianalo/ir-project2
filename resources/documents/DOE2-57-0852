Themeasurement of magnetic compatibility was made using a generator of disturbingpulses. A detailed description is presented of the electronic and structuraldesign of the generator. Tests were made using the magnetic componentof the disturbing field in a frequency range of 200 Hz to 10 MHz; alsotested was disturbance at supply connectors. The results are tabulated.It was found that detection units are resistant to the magnetic field.(E.S.). 3 refs., 35 figs., 12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
