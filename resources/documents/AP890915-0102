(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker continued toreceive huge bonuses while the troubled TV ministry was laying offhundreds of workers, witnesses testified today in his federal fraudand conspiracy trial.   ``I had to go to social services and apply for welfare and foodstamps,'' said Joanie Ames, a former PTL payroll clerk who was laidoff in November 1985 along with 285 other PTL employees.   Less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the PTL board approved a$500,000 bonus for Bakker. He had also received other bonuses duringthe year.   The Rev. Evelyn Spencer of Oakland, Calif., who joined the boardin November 1985, testified that the largest bonus she rememberedapproving was $150,000 plus taxes.   But when asked by prosecutor Deborah Smith if she would haveapproved a $500,000 bonus for Bakker, Ms. Spencer said: ``Ifeverybody else agreed with it, I would have.''   She said she trusted Bakker to keep board members informed of theministry's financial condition. ``I just trusted him, period,'' shesaid.   Prosecutors contend Bakker diverted $3.7 million in PTL funds tofund his lavish lifestyle. If convicted of all 24 counts againsthim, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined morethan $5 million.   On Thursday, Bakker's right-hand man at PTL testified that theevangelist gave his TV viewers phony fund-raising figures and knewthat $265,000 in church funds went to Jessica Hahn as hush money.   Richard Dortch, PTL's former executive vice president, toldjurors the ministry kept two sets of fund-raising figures _ a secretone with the actual numbers and a phony one with lower numbers thatBakker read to TV viewers.   ``No one understands this plan really but me,'' Dortch recalledBakker telling him.   Later, Dortch testified that Bakker personally approved payingHahn to keep her quiet about their 1980 sexual encounter in aFlorida hotel room. Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 as theencounter was about to be made public.   Dortch, 57, was indicted with Bakker, and last month pleadedguilty to four counts of fraud and conspiracy in a plea bargain inexchange for his testimony against Bakker. He was sentenced to eightyears in prison and fined $200,000.   Dortch, who joined PTL in December 1983, said by 1987 almost allPTL revenues came from sale of ``lifetime partnerships,'' supposedlygood for lodging each year for life at Heritage USA, PTL's Christiantheme park near Fort Mill, S.C. He said the money was desperatelyneeded to cover operating costs, including a biweekly payroll ofnearly $1 million.   Bakker considered the partnerships an unlimited ``gold mine,''according to Dortch.   He said Bakker told him: ``This was the easiest money we couldraise, and there would be no limit to what amount could be raised inthe days to come.''   The trial has included testimony from former partners who saidthey sent Bakker $1,000 for lodging but were turned away when theytried to claim their rooms.   Bakker was willing to oversell the partnerships because he wasconvinced he could manipulate the comings and goings of partnershipowners ``by getting partners here when we wanted them to come and bykeeping them away ... when we don't want them to come,'' Dortchtestified.   Dortch, released a week ago from a hospital where he was treatedfor an undisclosed ailment, also testified he told Bakker aboutcalls from Ms. Hahn threatening a lawsuit over their sexualencounter.   Dortch said Bakker told him: ```I have not raped anyone orassaulted anyone, but there is a problem. ... Do what you have to doto get it solved.'''   Dortch said he paid Ms. Hahn $2,000 from his own pocket and laterborrowed $10,000 from another PTL employee for Ms. Hahn in 1984.   Dortch arranged a February 1985 meeting in Los Angeles with Ms.Hahn's lawyer and handed over $265,000. The money came from RoeMessner, a PTL contractor, who later billed the ministry for worknever completed on PTL's Passion Play amphitheater.   After the Los Angeles meeting, Dortch said he saw Bakker atHeritage USA's Main Street shopping arcade and told him about thepayoff. He testified Bakker said, ``I don't want to know and I don'twant to hear about it.''</TEXT></DOC>
