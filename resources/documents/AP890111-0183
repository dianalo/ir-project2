An order to show cause why Johann Dorth, 64, should not bedeported was filed in U.S. Immigration Court by the JusticeDepartment's Office of Special Investigations.   The Nazi-hunting unit, which has obtained the deportation of 24former Nazis for persecutions committed during the Holocaust,charged that Dorth was a member of the Waffen-SS Death's Head unitsfrom 1942 to 1944.   The units, which guarded concentration camps set up by NaziGermany to kill six million Jews, were adjudged to be criminalorganizations by the Nuremberg war-crimes tribunal in 1946.   The Justice Department charged that Dorth participated in thetorture and murder of Jewish prisoners while he served as a Death'sHead guard at Auschwitz.   OSI charged that Dorth, a native of Yugoslavia, concealed his SSservice when he entered the United States from Austria in 1951.Dorth was admitted on a visa granted under the Displaced PersonsAct, the department said.   Under immigration law, authorities can seek deportation forpersons who concealed their identity as members of criminalorganizations when they were admitted to this country.   Such individuals have the burden of proving in immigration courtwhy they should be allowed to stay in the United States.   Dorth, who lives in Fairfield, Ohio, never applied for U.S.citizenship, the department said.</TEXT></DOC>
