Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 9.08% interest rate on 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said. That was the lowest level recorded by the Freddie Mac survey since January 1978, according to the agency's chief economist, Michael Lea.    Last week's rate was down from the 9.11% rate a month before and the 10.20% average of a year earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    In a separate survey, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that the average effective interest rate for fixed-rate mortgages early last month was 9.54%, down from 9.84% in early January and the eighth monthly decline in a row. These figures apply to conventional single-family home mortgages maturing in 25 or more years.    Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages also have dropped but not as much as for fixed-rate loans, according to the Bank Board survey. Lenders in early February were seeking an 8.50% average effective interest rate for the most popular kind of adjustable-rate loans, those that restrict rate increases. The rate was below the 8.66% rate of a month earlier. Similarly, the rate for adjustable-rate mortgages without rate limits declined to 8.25% from the 8.32% rate limit a month earlier.    Recent declines have left home-loan rates significantly below the 9.89% recorded last April, when falling rates set off a nationwide spree of home buying and refinancing. After a slight upturn in mid-April, rates fell through the summer until another small upturn last September. Since then, they generally have continued to fall.    Since Jan. 1, however, the rate has declined by increasingly small margins. This is one sign, according to analysts such as Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, that &quot;we've already seen them (rates) as low as they're going to go. . . . I think they're going to firm up.&quot;    Mr. Obrinsky said rates have stayed down partly because of seasonal factors, such as lessened homebuying activity in the winter months, and partly because of sluggish first-quarter economic activity. In coming months, he said, &quot;the trend will be toward increasing economic activity -- people borrowing to invest, to buy homes. That will put some upward pressure on interest rates.&quot;    At the same time, said Freddie Mac's Mr. Lea, &quot;I don't think there's anything in the cards for a real big rise,&quot; adding that rates probably won't go above 10%.    But other analysts, including John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, said they expected further declines. &quot;We'll dip below 9% before we're finished,&quot; he declared. &quot;With a sluggish economy, rates are still coming down and will probably stay down through March and April.&quot;    The Bank Board also reported that the adjustable-rate mortgages comprised 27% of all home loans in early February, slightly above the 25% figure of early January.    According to the same survey, the average price for a new home in early February was $132,600, the same as the revised January figure. Earlier the Board had reported the January price as $133,400.    The average term for all conventional mortgages that were closed in early February was 26.9 years, the Bank Board said, up from 26.3 a month earlier. Loans in February were an average 75% of purchase price, a level that has held over the past two months. </TEXT></DOC>
