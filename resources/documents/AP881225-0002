(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense officials now say the Savannah RiverPlant's three nuclear reactors probably won't be fully operationaluntil late 1989, according to a federal report.   Energy officials had said they hoped to get the three reactors atthe Aiken, S.C., facility back in operation for tritium productionby late spring or midsummer.   An executive summary of the Department of Energy's defensecomplex modernization plan said that in spite of planned safety andmaintenance improvements, the plant's reactors ``may not be able toachieve acceptable production efficiencies,'' according to a storypublished Sunday in the Augusta-based Morris Communications Corp.newspapers.   On Thursday, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said DOE hasdecided to use ultrasonic testing to check for cracks in the vesselof the Savannah plant's K reactor, a move that probably will keepthe reactor down until at least June. K reactor, one of three at theplant, has been targeted to restart first.   According to the report obtained by the newspaper group, ``Theexisting production reactors, at their current power limits, havelimited operational capability.''   Those reactors are one example of the fact that ``many facilitiesthroughout the (weapons) complex are approaching the end of theiruseful lives,'' the report said.   As much as $81 billion will be needed over the next 21 years tomodernize and clean up DOE defense facilities, the report said.   The Energy Department operates a number of facilities that helpproduce materials for nuclear weapons. The Savannah plant, locatedacross the Georgia-South Carolina border from Augusta, is one ofseveral that have been plagued recently with reports of safetylapses and other problems.   The three SRP reactors currently are the nation's sole productionsource of tritium, a radioactive isotope that enhances the explosivepower of nuclear warheads. Tritium decays 5.5 percent annually andmust be regularly replenished in warheads.</TEXT></DOC>
