This has revived complaints that theBritish cling to old trans-Atlantic ties and are unenthusiasticEuropeans.   Reagan's style provoked amusement, concern or jibing amongBritish opposition parties and in newspapers. But not even in strictconfidence would Thatcher aides utter a word of criticism of thepresident.   Reagan and Thatcher have disagreed on economic issues like theU.S. deficit, and she had misgivings about the missiles deal. Butthey're obviously fond of each other, call each other Ron andMargaret, and share some basic instincts, like their faith in thefree market and a strong defense, and their hatred of socialism.   ``You have restored faith in the American dream,'' Mrs. Thatchertold Reagan last summer when he paid a farewell presidential visitto Britain.   He said of the British leader who has been in office throughouthis two terms: ``We're very good friends and it is a friendship Itreasure very much.''</TEXT><NOTE>South Africa: A Diplomatic Success, But Apartheid Is Entrenched</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ The Reagan administration looked as if it was goingto come up empty on its southern Africa policies until ChesterCrocker, the assistant secretary of state, pulled out an 11th hourpeace agreement on Angola.   Until Crocker, a former Georgetown University professor, helpednegotiate the peace agreement last month, he was best known as thearchitect of the administration's policy of ``constructiveengagement.'' It called for the United States to use diplomaticpressure to force the white-ruled government of South Africa tochange its policies of racial segregation, called apartheid..   ``Constructive engagement,'' no longer part of the StateDepartment's official lexicon, was not a success. South Africa'spolicies remain virtually the same, with blacks denied political andsocial rights.   In the United States, ``constructive engagement'' was the targetof criticism and ridicule. And opponents of South Africa mounted acampaign which resulted in legislation in 1986 providing foreconomic sanctions against the white regime. They provided for a banon new investments, a prohibition on the import of certain SouthAfrican products and the suspension of South African commerciallanding rights in the United States. Reagan's veto of the sanctionswas overridden decisively.   In Angola, where the Reagan administration and South Africa hadsupported rebels seeking to overthrow the Cuban-backed Marxistgovernment, Crocker was more successful.   After months of mediating delicate negotiations, South Africa,Cuba and Angola signed an agreement under which Angola pledged tosend home 50,000 Cuban troops posted in Angola.   At the same time, South Africa granted independence to South-WestAfrica, the continent's last colony. It will become the black-rulednation of Namibia.   In sum, it was a mixed record for the Reagan administration.   _By Joan Mower</TEXT><NOTE>Latin America: Democracies, Saddled by Debts, Threatened</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ With U.S. encouragement, much of Latin America hasundergone an unprecedented political transformation fromdictatorship to democracy over the past decade but the region isnonetheless worse off economically now than when the generals werein charge.   Reagan and Shultz have repeatedly hailed the democraticdevelopment in the hemisphere. Nonetheless, the same economic forcesthat swept the dictatorships from power during the 1980's are nowthreatening the emerging democracies. In some countries, thepossibility of a military coup is not ruled out.   As Reagan leaves office, the potential political and economicconsequences of continued stagnation, partly the result of theregion's huge foreign debt, could become one of the majorhemispheric challenges for the new administration.   President-elect Bush has called for a ``major review'' ofexisting policy on debt, the centerpiece of which is the so-calledBaker plan, named for former Treasury Secretary and Secretary ofState-designate James A. Baker III.   The plan calls for economic reforms in the debtor countries andnew public and private lending from the developed countries to meettheir capital needs. But lending has been far below what had beenexpected when the plan was unveiled three years ago.   Hemispheric countries over the past five years have shelled outmore than $120 billion in debt repayments than they have received innew loans. Repayments on the region's $420 billion debt have meantthat decades of hard-won gains for some countries have been wipedout.   The region has been denied capital needed for investment andimports vital for production have been cut back sharply. Inflationand high unemployment are rampant.   The list of countries which have made the shift to democracy orare in the process of doing so since 1979 is impressive: Argentina,Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, El Salvador,Honduras and Guatemala.   But in virtually all of these countries, the popular base of theincumbent administrations has been eroding, reflecting thedifficulty they have in dealing with the consequences of excessiveborrowing in the past.   Increasingly, Latin leaders see debt relief as perhaps the onlyway their countries can restore economic growth and to prevent yetanother lost decade.   _By George Gedda</TEXT><NOTE>Mexico: Distrust on Both Sides of the Border</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ Reagan's departure coincides with the start of asix-year term by a new Mexican president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari,offer both countries a fresh opportunity for a more harmoniousrelationship.   Reagan met frequently with former Mexican President Miguel de laMadrid and the two got along well but the same cannot be said forofficials at the lower level.   The two governments disagreed sharply over Central America,particularly Nicaragua, where Mexico was viewed by administrationofficials as perhaps the most stalwart non-communist backer of theleftist Sandinista government.   Elliott Abrams, the outgoing assistant secretary of state forLatin America, concedes that the ``ideological tone'' of Mexico'sforeign policy over the years left the administration ``veryunhappy.''   U.S. officials angered Mexico by suggesting that officialcorruption was hampering that country's drug enforcement efforts.Mexico felt the Reagan administration failed to appreciate thesacrifices its security forces made to come to grips with the drugissue.   Drugs remain a potent issue. Mexico is believed to provide 30percent of the marijuana and 40 percent of the heroin reaching thiscountry.   Immigration is another divisive issue. The Reagan administrationmaintained that unwise Mexican economic policies forced millions ofMexicans to cross the border illegally. Mexico's view is that theimmigration is the result of the U.S. demand for cheap labor, whichit claims American policies fail to take into account.   On the economic front, Mexico has maintained that paying theinterest on its $107 billion foreign debt makes growth impossible.When Bush takes office, Mexico will be eagerly awaiting some signthat he will be amenable to a policy under which Mexico's debtservicing obligations might be matched to its payment capacity.Mexico has felt for years that its debt is the primary cause for asteady decline in Mexican living standards during the 1980s.   _By George Gedda</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
