<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-02-0558 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Lower Permian Dry Mountain trough (DMT) is one of several basins thatdeveloped during the Late Pennsylvanian to Permian along the westernedge of the North American continent. A tectonic mechanism has been suggestedfor the subsidence of the DMT, possibly due to reactivation of the Antlerorogenic belt during the waning stages of Ancestral Rocky Mountain deformation.The DMT records marked subsidence with the appearance during the Artinskian(latest Wolfcampian) of a deeper water facies that consists of thin-beddedsilty micrites and micritic mudstones rich in radiolarians and spongespicules, characterized by a relative abundance of ammonoids, and rarerconodonts and Nereites ichnofacies trace fossils. Taxa recovered froma distinctive concretionary horizon at various locations provide an Artinskiandatum on which to palinspastically reconstruct the DMT paleogeography.These taxa include ammonoids: Uraloceras, Medlicottia, Marathonites,Crimites, Metalegoceras, properrinitids; and conodonts: Neogondolellabisselli, Sweetognathus whitei, S. behnkeni, and Diplognathodus stevensi.The western margin facies of the DMT consists of Permian Carbon Ridge/GardenValley Formations. Here, lowermost black Artinskianage euxinic micrites,considered a potential source rock for petroleum generation, are overlainby base-of-slope carbonate apron deposits, which, in turn, are overlainby base-of-slope carbonate apron deposits, which, in turn, are overlainby a thick, eastwardly prograding conglomerate wedge. Seismic profilesacross Diamond Valley indicate a 3.0-4.6-km thick Tertiary sequence abovethe Paleozoic strata.</TEXT></DOC>
