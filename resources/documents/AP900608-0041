They're off to see the birthplace of the late Frances Ethel Gumm_ better known as Judy Garland _ who would have celebrated her 68thbirthday Sunday.   The diminutive actors and actresses will trek to Grand Rapids andwalk down a yellow brick road built last year to honor Garland, wholeft the northern Minnesota city as a youngster and was 15 when shestarred as Dorothy in the 1939 movie. She died of a drug overdose in1969.   A parade and an exhibit of private photographs of Garland areamong the planned festivities as part of the weeklong Judy GarlandFestival.   It's touted as the largest gathering of Munchkins sinceMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the movie. About two dozen of the 124Munchkins are still alive.   ``I'm especially glad to be here with all my old pals,'' saidJerry Maren, 69, the only surviving member of the Lollipop Guild. Inthe movie, the three-member guild welcomed Dorothy to Munchkinlandby giving her an enormous striped lollipop.   The Munchkinland scene lasted only 10 minutes. But it took nearlyseven weeks to shoot and helped make the movie a classic.   Most of the Munchkins earned just $50 a week for their services.   ``They paid Toto more than they paid me,'' quipped formerMunchkin Fern Formica.   Meinhardt Raabe, who played the coroner who pronounced the WickedWitch of the East dead, said the Munchkins didn't know much aboutthe rest of the movie while they worked.   ``We didn't have the script. All we had was the script forMunchkinland. After we left, they shot the rest of the picture.''   In his book ``The Munchkins Remembered,'' Stephen Cox saysgathering more than 100 midgets under one roof would be nearlyimpossible to repeat today.   Unlike dwarfs, midgets have bodies that are proportionatelycorrect, and advances in hormonal treatment now enable them to growto near-normal stature.   ``There just aren't enough little people any more,'' Maren saidwistfully. Formica said he doesn't think ``The Wizard of Oz'' isdated.   ``I think it'll be around for another 50 years,'' he said. ``Ifeel like someone much larger than us has had his hand on it fromthe very beginning.''</TEXT></DOC>
