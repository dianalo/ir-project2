ERICSSON and Britain's THORN EMI PLC said they agreed in principle that Ericsson will purchase the British company's 51% stake in Thorn Ericsson Telecommunications (Holdings) Ltd.    The telecommunications unit, set up by the two companies in 1973, will become a wholly owned unit of Ericsson. It will remain in Sussex, England, and continue to supply telecommunications equipment in Britain, Ericsson said. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.    Thorn EMI's chief executive officer, Colin Southgate, said the sale was consistent with Thorn's strategy of focusing on its core businesses. Ericsson said the acquisition strengthens its position as a supplier of telecommunications equipment in Europe.    Separately, Thorn EMI raised to 1,725 francs ($296.95) a share, or a total of 910 million francs ($156.7 million), from 1,222 francs a share its takeover offer for the French lighting-equipment maker Holophone. The bid is higher than an offer of 1,500 francs a share by Emess PLC, a British maker of lighting fixtures, but Emess said it had received irrevocable acceptances for 57% of Holophone by June 2. Thorn said it was confident its new bid will attract a majority of Holophone shares. </TEXT></DOC>
