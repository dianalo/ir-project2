The hiring by CS First Boston of Shearson's chiefadministrative officer, Robert M. Raziano, enabled CS FirstBoston to fill two new senior-management posts.</LP><TEXT>   In the more senior level appointment, Anthony P. Grassi, aFirst Boston Corp. managing director, was named chieffinancial and administrative officer of CS First Boston. Thejob includes business planning, budgeting and all financialand administrative systems. First Boston is CS First Boston'sU.S. investment bank   Mr. Raziano, meanwhile, will become head of finance,administration, systems and operations at First Boston. Mr.Raziano resigned from Shearson this week and his new job --which combines the former functions of chief financialofficer and the head of administration, systems andoperations -- is effective June 18.   Mr. Raziano assumes the duties of former First BostonChief Financial Officer John E. Toffolon Jr., who resigned,and Fenton R. &quot;Pete&quot; Talbott, the former head ofadministration and systems who CS First Boston said willassist Mr. Raziano &quot;in the transition.&quot;   At Shearson, Mr. Raziano was well known as the centralfigure in all of that firm's cost-containment efforts,including the brokerage firm's thousands of layoffs. Whilechief operating officer of Shearson's London unit during1987, for example, he sliced 150 of the unit's nearly 1,300employees. CS First Boston wouldn't say it hired Mr. Razianosimply to help with layoffs, but that is clearly part of hisjob.   &quot;The reason we have hired Mr. Raziano is because he is oneof the best people on the Street in finance, administration,systems and operations,&quot; said a CS First Boston spokesman,&quot;and clearly part of that function is making sure we operateas efficiently as possible.&quot;   A Shearson spokesman said there are no plans at this timeto find a successor to Mr. Raziano. Because Shearson planssoon to split into separate brokerage and investment-bankingunits, Mr. Raziano's old job won't exist anymore but willprobably be divided up.   CS First Boston has been in a cost-cutting mode. The firm,which is 44.5%-owned by the parent of Swiss bank CreditSuisse, reported a slim $11 million profit last year; thisyear it is trying to cut costs by at least 10%, and isexpected to trim hundreds of employees from its world-widestaff of 6,000.</TEXT></DOC>
