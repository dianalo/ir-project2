A four-year-old girl suffering from a genetic disordercalled ADA deficiency, a rare and devastating malfunction ofthe immune system, was given an infusion of cells containingcopies of a gene she lacks. She is missing the ADA gene,which manufactures an enzyme that clears wastes from thebody. Scientists hope the adenosine deaminase genes they haveinserted into the unidentified girl's bloodstream will beginproducing the missing enzyme and rebuild her immune system.</LP><TEXT>   It will be several months before the doctors, FrenchAnderson of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, andMichael Blaese and Kenneth Culver of the National CancerInstitute, know whether, or how well, the experiment works.But the initial infusion went well, scientists and the girl'sfather said.   The doctors will monitor the patient, as well as severalother children who will have similar infusions later, tolearn how long the cells containing copies of the ADA genewill survive in the girl's bloodstream and how much herimmune system improves.   An NIH panel cleared the path-breaking therapy in lateJuly after lengthy review and the Food and DrugAdministration gave its approval just hours before theinfusion Friday.   Gene therapy may ultimately help treat or cure a widerange of diseases and disorders, including cancer, cysticfibrosis, sickle cell anemia, certain types of arthritis andsome mental disorders.</TEXT></DOC>
