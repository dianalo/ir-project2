Bush also warned he would not tolerate sympathy strikesthreatened by other unions to support the Machinists.   Eastern wanted Bush to stay out of the dispute, saying either astrike, if it involved pilots, or postponement of the strike, wouldlead to bankruptcy.   The AFL-CIO and 33 senators had asked Bush to intervene toprevent ``a major disruption of interstate commerce.''</TEXT><NOTE>STRIKE PREPARATIONS</NOTE><TEXT>   Eastern said it would slash up to 75 percent of its weekendflights, including most services from its Atlanta hub and about 60other cities.   The airline said earlier that it was prepared to operate duringany strike and had contracted with 1,100 non-union mechanics toservice planes.   Eastern's pilots rejected an appeal Thursday by airline ownerFrank Lorenzo for them to sign a new contract and cross Machinistspicket lines.   Flight attendants said they would honor picket lines.   Airports nationwide strengthened security and other airlines havereported surges in sales this week.</TEXT><NOTE>MACHINISTS SENT HOME</NOTE><TEXT>   Eastern obtained a federal court order and sent its machinistshome, saying the action was intended to prevent sabotage.   Machinists were given a paid holiday and told to return to workfor shifts starting at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, one minute after thestrike deadline. Eastern said management personnel would handleground duties for the rest of the day.</TEXT><NOTE>NEGOTIATIONS END</NOTE><TEXT>   Eastern's offer Thursday was rejected Friday by the Machinistsunion, and federal officials said they expected a strike at themidnight deadline as talks continued between the airline and theunion.   Eastern said the contract offered would reduce mechanics' pay butstill keep their salaries 13 percent higher than employees who tooka 20 percent pay cut when Lorenzo took over in 1986. It said baggagehandlers' cuts would be no greater than those of other employees.   At 12:01 a.m., the Machinists went on strike.</TEXT><NOTE>LABOR SUPPORT</NOTE><TEXT>   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and other union leaders said theydoubted there would be any settlement because Lorenzo wants todismantle Eastern, which they said is worth about $500 million.   Other unions pledged support in a plan to block work at otherairlines, railways and sea transport companies if a strike is called.   The Airline Pilots Association announced that in the event of anEastern strike, it would instruct its 40,000 members beginningTuesday to strictly follow procedures that would cause ``substantialdelays.''   Kirkland said the AFL's 14 million members should honor theEastern pickets wherever they are legally set up.   A federal court in Minnesota enjoined Northwest Airlinesemployees from staging a sympathy strike. Other airlines and theunion won a U.S. District Court order in Washington that bannedpicketing of companies other than Eastern.</TEXT></DOC>
