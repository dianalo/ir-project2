Analysts said the balance-sheet adjustment was aimed atmaking Daimler-Benz look more attractive to internationalinvestors, who don't always account for conservative WestGerman accounting practices when assessing West Germanbalance sheets.</LP><TEXT>   When excluding the accounting adjustment, the automotiveand technology conglomerate said that the group's net incomewould have been unchanged at the 1988 net income level of 1.7billion marks, reflecting pressured earnings from automotiveoperations last year. The extraordinary gain will beallocated to equity reserves, the company said.   The gain came on a write-back of part of Daimler-Benz'soverfunded pension provisions and undervalued inventoriesaccumulated over previous years. Daimler-Benz said it alteredthe conservative basis on which it calculates the twopositions to better reflect international standards in timefor planned stock listings on the London and Tokyo stockexchanges later this year.   Stephen Reitman, an auto analyst at UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew inLondon estimated that the change will boost the company'sequity as a percentage of total assets to around 30% from22%, bringing its per-share net asset value to 400 marks from267 marks. &quot;Basically, it will make the company look moresolid than under its old system of overprovisioning forpensions,&quot; Mr. Reitman said. After cumulative gain for 1989results, the analyst judged that the change to pensionvaluations in the future will reduce the company's annuallabor costs by an annual 500 million marks.</TEXT></DOC>
