HAMM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal drug and perjury charges against afriend of Mayor Marion Barry Jr. are prompting critics to raise newquestions about the mayor's ability to lead the city's anti-drugwar.   Charles Lewis, 48, a former city employee, was charged in a10-count indictment Thursday with lying to a grand jury seven timesabout whether he used, bought, shared or offered to sell cocaine.He also faces three counts of cocaine possession.   It is the second time in five years that an associate of themayor's has faced drug charges.   ``It heightens the circumstantial perception that there's morethere than we've been told,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., anoutspoken critic of the Barry administration. ``When do you reachthe point where you can conclude that where there's smoke, there'sfire?''   One of the perjury charges alleges that Lewis lied about whetherhe possessed cocaine on Dec. 22, a day that Barry has acknowledgedvisiting Lewis' hotel room at a Ramada Inn in the city.   ``What was the mayor doing with Mr. Lewis?'' asked councilchairman David Clarke.   Lewis also is charged with lying about whether he bought or useddrugs with two companions on Dec. 21, a day on which Barryreportedly visited his room twice.   The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Jay B. Stephens,stressed that the indictment does not accuse the mayor or anyonebut Lewis of wrongdoing.   But one top city official who spoke only on condition ofanonymity said, ``I wouldn't rest easily if I were the mayor.Stephens made clear he isn't done _ which could mean a lot more canhappen.''   Lewis' indictment marks the second time Barry's reputation hasbeen clouded by charges that his friends use drugs. In 1984,convicted cocaine dealer Karen Johnson spent 11 months in jail oncontempt charges after she refused to tell a grand jury whether sheused drugs with Barry and other top city officials.   Barry, who is married, acknowledged having a ``personalrelationship'' with Johnson, but denied using drugs with her.   The Lewis indictment, which comes as Barry is struggling to slowa drug-fueled record murder rate, threatens to further underminethe mayor's leadership and credibility on drug issues.   The mayor's attorney, Kenneth Mundy, said of the indictment:``It does not refer to any allegedly perjurious statements by Mr.Lewis to the grand jury which involve the mayor.'' Mundy said thatleft the message that ``the mayor's conduct, whatever else it mighthave been, was nothing criminal.''   Mundy also confirmed that he had met with Barry on Thursday, butdeclined to discuss their conversation.   Barry has repeatedly asserted that Lewis never used drugs in hispresence.   The U.S. attorney's office began its probe Dec. 22 when citypolice officers were called off an attempt to make an undercoverdrug purchase from Lewis after Barry showed up at his hotel room.   Stephens said the investigation has cleared police of anymisconduct but continues to focus on the Ramada Inn episode andother related events, including a $260,000 joint personnel projectinvolving the city and Virgin Islands governments. Lewis was firedfrom the project a year ago amid concerns about cost overruns.   Although Lewis checked out of his hotel room Dec. 23, beforepolice could search it or officially link traces of cocaine foundin the room to him, Stephens said investigators may have gatheredphysical evidence that will stand up in court.   Barry, who found out about the indictment while testifying onthe city's drug problem before a House panel, refused to comment.   If convicted, Lewis faces a five-year maximum penalty on eachperjury charge, plus up to one year for each cocaine possessioncharge. Lewis is already under indictment in the Virgin Islands.   He is awaiting trial there on April 17 on two counts ofpossession of a controlled substance with intent to distributeafter he allegedly tried to sell crack cocaine to an undercover FBIagent.</TEXT></DOC>
