A spokesman said the results were largely a result of cost-reduction and restructuring policies in the period, and a higher dollar. Improved domestic demand for machinery and reduced reliance on export markets also helped offset the slip in sales, he said.    Sales edged down 0.2% to 787.02 billion yen ($6.3 billion) from 788.48 billion yen. Net income rose 59% to 16.38 billion yen from 10.28 billion yen. </TEXT></DOC>
