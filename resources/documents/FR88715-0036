Introduction</ITAG>A notice of proposed rulemaking for coal product valuation regulationswas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 15, 1987 (52 FR 1840), with a 90-daycomment period. The public comment period was reopened on July 9, 1987.Additional comments were accepted through July 23, 1987 (52 FR 25887).A total of 82 comments were received from industry representatives, Stategovernments, local governments, Indian Tribes, Indian organizations, andother persons.During the initial comment period, a public hearing on the proposed rulemakingwas held on March 3, 1987, in Denver, Colorado. The Royalty ManagementAdvisory Committee (RMAC) also held a meeting on April 1, 1987, in Denver,Colorado, on the proposed coal valuation rulemaking. Industry, State, andIndian representatives also met with MMS and Department of the Interior(Department) officials during the comment period to discuss issues pertainingto the proposed rulemaking. Minutes from these meetings were included inthe record and were incorporated as comments on the proposed rulemakingalong with the transcripts from the public hearing and RMAC meeting, andwritten comments received by MMS.On August 12, 1987, MMS published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 29868) reopening the public comment periodfor 60 days primarily to obtain public comments on a proposal submittedjointly on behalf of the coal and electric utility industries. This proposalincluded a comprehensive, section-by-section set of revisions to the January1987 proposed rulemaking. The MMS received 48 comments on the industryproposal which are discussed in more detail below.The MMS also recently completed two rulemakings to adopt new product valuationregulations for oil (53 FR 1184, January 15, 1988) and gas (53 FR 1230,January 15, 1988). The rulemaking process for oil and gas included draftrules, proposed rules, and two further notices of proposed rulemaking withdraft final rules appended. (Citations are included in the preamble tothe final rules.)On June 7, 8, and 9, 1988, MMS held open meetings with representativesof the Western States, Indian Tribes, and the coal and electric utilityindustries to discuss a draft of this proposed rule. Several suggestedchanges and additions offered at those meetings have been incorporatedin this proposed rule.In this preamble, MMS will note some of the principal comments receivedthus far on the coal rules. Most comments will be addressed in the finalrule. The MMS will include in the rulemaking record all comments receivedto date plus the comments on this further notice of proposed rulemaking.To the extent that the regulatory provisions in this notice have not changedsignificantly from the January 1987 proposal, we are not repeating thepreamble discussion in this notice. Commenters should refer to the January15, 1987, notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 1840).Sections 206.254, 206.257, 206.259, 206,262, and 206.263 of the proposedrule contain information collection requirements. Public reporting burdenfor this collection of information is estimated to vary from one half hourto 3 hours per response with an average of 1.5 hours per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Due to the complexity of the information requested, applicationsfor allowances, using Forms MMS-4292 and MMS-4293 in non-arm's-length orno-contract situations may require up to an estimated 40 hours per response.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information including suggestions for reducing this burden,to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Mail Stop 631, MineralsManagement Service, 12203 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 22091; and tothe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Background</ITAG>These rules would supersede all currently effective coal royalty valuationdirectives, such as those contained in numerous Secretarial, MMS, and U.S.Geological Survey Conservation Division (now Bureau of Land ManagementOnshore Operations) decisions and orders. These rules would apply to productionon or after the effective date of the final rule for all leases includingcoal from existing leases, except for certain proposed grandfather provisionswhich are addressed later in this preamble.Structurally, these rules add sections to 30 CFR Parts 202, 203, and 206,revise subpart titles in Part 212, and remove paragraphs from 30 CFR 203.250and 43 CFR 3485.2. Paragraph (b) of andSection; 203.250 is redesignated toPart 202 as andSection; 202.250. Also, andSection;andSection; 206.250, 206.251,206.252, 206.253, 206.254, 206.255, 206.256, 206.257, 206.258, 206.259,206.260, 206.261, 206.262, 206.263, 206.264, and 206.265 are added to SubpartF of Part 206.For the convenience of coal lessees, payors, and the public, the followingchart summarizes the effects of the proposed rule:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Regulation Changes (all from 30 CFR, except as noted)</H1><H1>Descriptions</H1>I.

Except for Indian cents-per-tonleases (which currently have specific royalty provisions in Title 25 ofthe Code of Federal Regulations, <T3>see</T3> 25 CFR 211.15(c), 212.18(c), 213.23(c), and 214.10(b)), thisis a continuation of the practices under existing regulations.These rules expressly recognize, however, that where the provisions ofany Indian lease, or any statute or treaty affecting Indian leases, areinconsistent with the regulations, then the lease, statute, or treaty shallgovern to the extent of the inconsistency. This same principle appliesto Federal leases.The mineral leasing laws require that the Secretary receive a royalty onthe ``value of production'' or the ``value of coal'' from minerals producedfrom Federal lands, but value is a word without precise definition. ``Menhave all but driven themselves mad in an effort to definitize its meaning.''<T3>Andrews </T3>v.<T3> Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</T3> 135 F.2d 314, 317 (2nd Cir.1943). The word ``value'' has sometimes been modified by the words ``fairmarket,'' although the mineral leasing law provisions on ``value of production''do not include these words. But, these adjectives do not really clarifythe word value. The word ``fair'' can modify the word value as in ``fairvalue'' or it can modify the word market as in ``fair market.'' The term``fair value'' may not be interpreted the same as the ``fair market'' value.The term fair market value, however, has been generally accepted to bethe price received by a willing and knowledgeable seller, not obligatedto sell, from a willing and knowledgeable buyer not obligated to buy. Willing,knowledgeable, and obligated are again adjectives which are not terms ofprecise definition. These general concepts, however, were still the generalprinciples which were followed in drafting these regulations on valuationof production for the purpose of calculating royalties. The general presumptionis that persons buying or selling products from Federal and Indian leasesare willing, knowledgeable, and not obligated to buy or sell. Because theU.S. economy is built upon a system whereby individuals are provided theopportunity to advance their individual self interest, this seems to bea reasonable presumption. This system and its reliance on self-motivatedindividuals to engage in transactions that are to their own best interest,therefore, is a cornerstone of the regulations.The purpose of the regulations is to define the value of production, forroyalty purposes, for production from Federal and Indian lands. Value canbe determined in different ways, and these rules explain how value is tobe established in different circumstances. Value in these regulations generallyis determined by prices set by individuals of opposing economic intereststransacting business between themselves. Prices received for the sale ofproducts from Federal and Indian leases pursuant to arm's-length contractsare often accepted as value for royalty purposes. However, even for somearm's-length contracts, contract prices may not be used for value purposesif the lease terms provide for other measures of value (such as Indianleases) or when there is a reason to suspect the bona fide nature of aparticular transaction. Even the alternative valuation methods, however,are determined by reference to prices received by individuals buying orselling like-quality products in the same general area and having opposingeconomic interests. Also, in no instance can value be less than the amountreceived by a lessee in a particular transaction.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Response to General Comments on the First Notice of ProposedRulemaking</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One issue that permeated many of the comments, but whichis unrelated to coal valuation, concerns the royalty rate. Several commentssubmitted by industry and several States stated that the 12\1/2\-percentroyalty rate was too high thus placing an unfair financial burden on lessees,which in turn places them at an economic disadvantage. One State commentedthat royalty rates, in concert with valuation of deep-mined coal, placeunderground mines at a disadvantage and the 8-percent royalty rate ``shouldbe lowered accordingly to a maximum rate of 5 percent, but more equitably,a lower rate should be adopted by legislative action.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The royalty rate is not a valuation issue. The 12\1/2\-percentroyalty rate imposed on surface coal operations is required by statute.The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA), as amended specifically by the FederalCoal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976 (FCLAA), requires the Secretary ofthe Interior to determine a royalty ``of not less than 12\1/2\-per centum* * * except the Secretary may determine a lesser amount in the case ofcoal recovered by underground mining operations.'' The Bureau of Land Management(BLM) regulations at 43 CFR 3473.3-2 require a royalty rate of 8 percentfor coal from underground mines, with the provision to determine a lesserrate if conditions warrant, but in no case less than 5 percent. The MLAat 30 U.S.C. 209 provides statutory authority to reduce royalty rates forthose lessees that cannot successfully operate their leases under the prevailingterms and conditions.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters expressed concern that deletion ofredundant royalty provisions from 43 CFR 3485.2 would create confusionbecause of cross-references found in other sections of 43 CFR Part 3480.The MMS agrees that some potential confusion could result if certain sectionsof 43 CFR 3480 continue to refer to portions of 43 CFR 3485.2 which wouldbe deleted under a final rulemaking. The BLM will, as part of its normalongoing housekeeping duties, ensure that 43 CFR 3480 is appropriately modifiedto eliminate cross-references to nonexistent sections.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters stated that in the January 1987 proposedrulemaking, MMS neither acknowledged nor adopted the Royalty ManagementAdvisory Committee's (RMAC's) recommendations concerning coal product valuation.These commenters also stated that MMS did not provide its reasoning fornot accepting RMAC's recommendations.  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> These comments are without merit. The January 15,1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice states that ``MMS also has consideredthe written and oral comments from the public on the draft rules and theresolution presented to the Secretary by RMAC.'' (52 FR 1840) The MMS alsonoted with appreciation the dedicated efforts of all participants who workedon the problems of coal valuation. The MMS considered the section-by-sectionanalysis that preceded the proposed rules adequate explanation and noticeto the public, including RMAC, of the substantive reasoning and motivationthat guided the formulation of the proposed rules.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Several industry commenters claimed that MMS's proposedregulations were destroying the longstanding past practice of royalty valuationwhich is supported by administrative and judicial decisions. Some commentersstated that MMS's regulations represented an attempt to broaden, not clarify,regulations pertaining to royalty valuation. One commenter stated that,``The Minerals Management Service has demonstrated an attitude which borderson the rapacious. The proposed rules are nothing more than a naked attemptto maximize revenues from federal and Indian coal leaseholds.'' One commenterstated that MMS's use of longstanding policy to support these regulationswas untenable, because there is no longstanding policy for coal productvaluation.  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS disagrees with the commenter's categorizationof MMS's attitude as bordering on the ``rapacious.'' On the contrary, MMSbelieves the proposed rules appropriately update and clarify existing policiesregarding coal royalty valuation. The MMS and its predecessor agency, theConservation Division, U.S. Geological Survey, have always required royaltyto be paid on the full value of the coal. This policy was established inthe early 1970's in order to uniformly administer the first Federal coalleases that carried ad valorem royalty rates. Many of the original underlyingprinciples of coal royalty valuation were cloned from existing valuationpractices for noncoal leasable minerals, notably phosphate, potassium,and sodium, which, since the enactment of the MLA, have always requiredad valorem royalty rates. The MMS considers royalty valuation principlesdating back to the 1920's and 1930's as longstanding.  <T3>Comment:</T3> State and Indian commenters stated that the manner inwhich the proposed regulations were constructed essentially eliminatesthe protection of the existing regulations, and the self-implementing aspectsof the proposed regulations invite industry abuse. These commenters furthercharged that MMS was abrogating its monitoring, review, and audit responsibilitieswith respect to coal product valuation. On the other hand, one industrycommenter stated an objection to the ``subjective determination elements[which] indicate a significant distrust by the government of the coal industry'spast practices of valuation and accounting for royalty purposes.''    <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS believes that no derogatory connotationof industry accounting or valuation practices should be attributed to thefirst proposed rules. These rules should also not be viewed as delegatingvaluation responsibilities and duties to industry. The report entitled``Fiscal Accountability of the Nation's Energy Resources'' written by theLinowes Commission and published in January 1982 (p. xvi) stated ``<T3>The Federal government should perform an oversight role</T3>. It mustnot waste its limited resources on tasks that are industry's responsibility.In managing royalty collection, it should not remain mired in bookkeepingdetails that rightly belong to the lessee. Instead, it should develop systematic,independent cross checks of royalties paid and reports submitted by companies,and it should impose meaningful penalties for false statements or grosserrors.'' The MMS considers these rules to carry out that recommendation. <T3>Comment:</T3> Many industry commenters stated that the proposed regulationsdo not promote development of Federal coal resources. An area of concernto these commenters is that these regulations discourage conservation ofFederal coal. Some industry commenters stated that the proposed regulationswould influence the economic behavior of the coal industry. One commenter'srationale for this position was that ``The economic forces of the marketplacewould move mine plans away from high-royalty/high-cost coal to lower-royalty/lower-costcoal or would hasten the closure or cessation of the mining of such Federalcoal reserves.'' One commenter also stated ``that MMS or BLM, is partyto the ups and downs of the coal business and as such should work withthe industry to improve market share as well as profitability.'' One commenterstated that MMS failed to take into consideration the Mining and MineralsPolicy Act of 1970, which states that in part that: ``The Congress declaresthat it is the continuing policy of the Federal Government * * * to fosterand encourage private enterprise in (1) the development of economicallysound and stable domestic mining * * *.'' One State commenter and one Indiancommenter suggested that MMS should ignore any potential economic impactsthat may result from the final coal valuation regulations. Opposing thisviewpoint, one industry commenter stated that MMS should consider the plightof the electric utility rate payer who ultimately bears the full burdenof any royalty increase.  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS disagrees with the statement that theseregulations do not promote development of coal resources. The MMS considersthese regulations to promote development to the extent that they wouldbetter communicate MMS's coal valuation policy to lessees. In this respect,the informed judgment of lessees, who are also prudent businessmen, isenhanced, thus providing increased certainty regarding the economic consequencesof Federal or Indian coal lease production. The MMS has no mandate to promulgatecoal valuation rules that are expressly designed to preserve or improvethe Federal or Indian lessor's overall nationwide market share of coalproduction.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Some industry commenters stated that all existing coalsales contracts or supply agreements should be ``grandfathered'' underany new royalty scheme. Under this approach, any such coal sales contractswould be subject to the royalty requirements in effect at the time thecoal supply contract was executed. One of these comments cited the InteriorBoard of Land Appeals (IBLA) support for this position by quoting <T3>Kanawha andamp; Hocking Coal andamp; Coke Co</T3>., 93 IBLA 179, at 183as follows: ``The method of calculating the value of coal for royalty purposesshall be that method set forth in the regulation on the effective dateof readjustment, and any subsequent regulatory change will not alter thatmethod.'' Similarly, two industry commenters requested that only leasesreadjusted after these rules become effective should be subject to theseregulatory requirements. Other respondents raised this issue again in commentssubmitted specific to andSection;206.250(b).  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> It is MMS's intent that absent specific lease termsthat set forth specific valuation criteria, the proposed rules, when final,would govern the valuation of coal from Federal and Indian leases. However,there are some lessees with contracts that pre-date the Federal Coal LeasingAmendments Act (FCLAA) of 1976 and that do not have reimbursement provisionscommon to contracts after FCLAA's enactment. The MMS would like commentson whether there is a way to grandfather these contracts that would beconsistent with the requirements of FCLAA and the Mineral Leasing Act. With regard to the comments that MMS should not make the new regulationsapplicable to existing pre-FCLAA contracts because the new rules wouldrequire royalty to be paid on payments which the commenters said are notroyalty bearing under existing rules, MMS would like further comments,specifically identifying the type of payments that are involved.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two industry commenters stated that the proposed royaltyvaluation instructions are unclear when there is mixed mineral ownershipat a single mine. One commenter requested that MMS provide guidance forthe calculation of royalties ``when an operator is producing coal fromboth Federal and non-Federal [lands] * * * .'' This commenter also statedthat this issue becomes even more critical with respect to payments forinsurance compensation, coal recovered from waste piles or slurry ponds,take-or-pay payments, and purchaser reimbursements for certain costs items.Another industry commenter claimed that it is ``entirely possible thatthe definition of gross proceeds will be significantly different on theFederal and non-Federal leases.''  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS agrees that royaly terms in leases betweenprivate land owners and coal operators, or between States and coal operators,may differ significantly from Federal lease royalty terms. However, theapplicability of these proposed rules is limited to Federal and IndianTribal and allotted coal leases. See andSection;206.250. Similarly, valuationprocedures or instruction contained in private or State leases do not pertainto Federal or Indian leases.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Two State commenters argued that MMS's attempt to providecertainly to coal valuation in the regulations has resulted in the eliminationof necessary agency discretion. One commenter explained, ``Flexibilityin the regulations that allows for some discretion on the part of the auditingagency is necessary.''  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS disagrees that the rules eliminate necessaryagency discretion. For example, andSection;andSection;206.259(b) [now designatedandSection;206.257(d)] and 206.259(d) [now designated andSection;206.257(d)]provide for MMS to establish a value for royalty purposes if a determinationis made that the lessee's reported value is inconsistent with the requirementsof the regulations. Similar provisions for MMS's adjustment of coal washingand transportation allowances are provided andSection;andSection;206.260 and206.262 [now designated andSection;andSection;206.259 and 206.262]. Also, inresponse to these comments, additional language has been added to andSection;206.259(b)[now designated_andSection;206.257(b)] which now allows MMS to determineif the sales contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred,either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to seller and also to determineif certain factors would render the sales contract to be deemed non-arm's-length. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Section-by-Section Analysis  </ITAG>Many of the sections have not changed significantly from the January 1987notice of proposed rulemaking. This preamble primarily will focus on thesignificant changed sections.  Proposed andSection;206.250 Purpose and Scope.  This section would provide that if the provisions of any statute, treaty,lease, <T3>or</T3> settlement agreement (resulting from administrative or judiciallitigation) are inconsistent with any of the regulations, then the statute,treaty, lease, or settlement agreement provision governs to the extentof the inconsistency.  Paragraph (d) has been revised so that it would specifically refer to thetrust responsibility of the United States with respect to the administrationof Indian coal leases.  Proposed andSection;206.251 Definitions.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Some industry respondents recommended deletion of thewords ``amount or'' from the proposed definition of ``ad valorem lease.''One commenter explained: ``Amount of production is only relevant in a take-in-kindroyalty provisions [sic]. There is no authorization for such a provisionin the MLA [Minerals Leasing Act of 1920, as amended].''  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The phrase ``based upon a percentage of the amountor value of the production'' is appropriate because Indian leases may bedesignated to include a royalty-in-kind proviso. Because these rules wouldbe equally applicable to Federal and Indian coal production, it is properto include regulatory language that provides for this possibility.  <T3>Comment:</T3> The phrase ``Coal washing allowance'' appears in theseproposed rules as an integral part of the definition of ``Allowance.''Many industry respondents recommended expanding the scope of the definitionand changing the term ``coal washing allowance'' to ``coal processing allowance.''One commenter stated this change was necessary to be consistent with theproposed revisions to andSection;206.260 [now designated andSection;andSection;206.258and 206.259]. Many other commenters supported the proposed expansion forvarious similar reasons including the suggestions that ``an allowance shouldbe extended to all processing costs incurred downstream from the pointor royalty determination'' and to ``other methods of beneficiation whichmay increase the value of coal . . . .'' Examples provided as other formsof procesing included pelletizing, treatment with chemicals or oil, drying,crushing, and sizing.  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS acknowledges the existence of developingcoal quality enhancement techniques other than the commercially availablecoal washing process. However, rather than transplant coal washing allowanceprocedures to other coal beneficiation technologies, MMS believes it ispreferable to provide a rule that recognizes coal beneficiation processesother than coal washing for royalty valuation purposes. A new andSection;206.265has been added to these proposed rules to address these comments. The discussionof andSection;260.265 appears later in this preamble.  <T3>Comment:</T3> One Indian commenter recommended deleting ``all referencesto washing allowances,'' and maintained that the basic premise of the regulationsis that the lessee ``is obligated to place the mineral in its first marketablecondition.'' In support of this position, this commenter stated: ``Theincorporation of a practice which is primarily a conservation measure doesnot belong in regulations to value the product for royalty purposes.''This commenter concluded that such decisions as approving washing allowancesbe the responsibility of ``the agency leasing the minerals.''  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> Coal washing is not necessarily practiced as anexclusive conservation measure. It is feasible for coal operators to washcoal to upgrade a first marketable product. Because the net effect of coalwashing is to increase heat content and to provide a cleaner burning productby removal of ash and sulfur, an operator may desire to wash coal to extendits market reach or expand its potential customer base. The MMS considersany attempt to differentiate between washing as a conservation measure(to develop a first marketable product) and washing as a marketing tacticto be a needless expenditure of MMS's limited manpower resources. Allowanceshave been provided to coal lessees that wash Federal or Indian coal sincethe inception of ad valorem royalty rates. These rules increase the levelof detail necessary to obtain coal washing allowances but otherwise wouldcontinue existing policy.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Some industry comments recommended deleting the ``reasonableness''standard. The proposed definition provided for a coal washing allowancebased on the ``reasonable, actual costs.'' One commenter explained that``there is no indication of what would be considered reasonable or unreasonable.We believe that the concept of `reasonableness' is inherent in all of thelessee's obligations under these regulations.''  <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS normally considers any cost incurred forcoal washing or transportation that is out of proportion to standard industypractices to be unreasonable. However, this statement may be tempered bythe specific situation that created the unusual and unreasonable costs.In any event, because the commenter acknowledges that the concept of reasonablenessis present in all lessee's obligations, it seems no greater an impositionto explicitly state the term in the regulation.  The phrase ``Transportation allowance'' also appears in these rules asan integral part of the definition of ``Allowance.'' Several industry respondentsprovided comments on this proposed definition. Many of the same commentswere received as dicusssed above with respect to the phrase ``coal washingallowance.'' These will not be addressed again.  <T3>Comment:</T3> One industry commenter recommeded ``that the final regulationsshould be amended to provide an allowance for <T3>all</T3> transportation costs.'' No elaboration or explanation wasprovided.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has no intent to provide transportationallowances for routine in-mine transportation costs, which every miningoperation encounters to some degree. In-mine transportation is an integralpart of the total mining process, the cost of which the Federal or Indianowner has historically not shared. Additional discussion of transportationallowances appears later in this preamble. The MMS notes, however, thatunder the definition of ``mine,'' no allowance would be approved for coaltransported between mine facilities, including, for instance, transportationbetween the pit (or portals, in the case of an underground mine) and thecrusher, or for transfer from the crusher to other mine surface facilities,including the storage and loadout facility.<T3>Comment: </T3>The MMS received numerous comments on the definitionof ``arm's-length contract.'' ``Arm's-length contract'' would be definedas a contract or agreement that has been arrived at in the marketplacebetween independent, nonaffiliated persons with opposing economic interestsregarding that contract. Affiliation essentially would be a control test:ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control; ownership of 10through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and ownership of lessthan 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which MMS can rebut.Contracts between relatives would not be arm's-length contracts. To beconsidered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must meetthe requirements of the definition for that month as well as when the contractwas executed. Thus, if two contracting parties were not affiliated whenthe contract was executed, but are affiliated now, the contract would benon-arm's-length.The definition of gross proceeds received more comments than any othersection of the proposed regulations. Thirty-nine respondents, consistingof industry representatives, one local government association, and oneState, specifically supported MMS's proposed deletion of reimbursementsfor Black Lung Excise Taxes and Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fees (AML)from the gross proceeds definition. One industry respondent explained:``The exclusion of Abandoned Mine Reclamation (AML) fees and Black Lung(BL) taxes is appropriate as they add no enhancement to the real valueof the coal.'' Another industry commenter noted support for ``SecretaryHodel's proposal to exclude those reimbursables [Federal Black Lung Taxesand Abandoned Mine Lands Fees] from gross proceeds on the grounds thatit is inequitable to require lessees to pay royalties on levies imposedby federal, state, or local governments solely to mine coal.'' Many otherrespondents repeated this rationale. One industry respondent offered asomewhat different reasoning by stating that it was appropriate for MMSto take action to ``enhance the competitiveness of Federal and Tribal coal,and hence the viability of the domestic coal industry.''Eighteen respondents, consisting of 14 State organizations and 4 Indiangroups, opposed the exclusion of <T3>any </T3>reimbursed taxes or fees from gross proceeds. Most respondentsmaintained that MMS's explanation of why Black Lung Excise Taxes and AMLfees are excluded from gross proceeds was not sufficient or acceptable.One Indian respondent specifically commented that MMS's justification forexclusion was not true with respect to Indians, who do not set the rateof either the Black Lung Excise Tax or the AML fee. The respondent furthernoted that AML fees have not been made available to Indian lands. A Staterespondent commented: ``These fees are essentially a pass-through, thelessee does receive the benefit of the purchaser reimbursing him * * *.''These costs would otherwise be borne by the lessee. Another State respondentclaimed: ``The MMS proposal would have the effect of reducing royaltieson coal without going through the findings required under the MineralsLeasing Act, 30 U.S.C. 209.'' One other State respondent concurred withthis statement. Several other State respondents objected to the exclusionof Black Lung Excise Taxes and AML fees on the grounds that it sets a precedentand ``opens the door for the exclusion of other items * * *.''Over 50 industry and 2 States respondents submitted comments requestingthat MMS extend the exclusion of Black Lung Excise Taxes and AML fees toother similar taxes and fees that are normally assessed at the State andlocal levels. One particular industry commenter explained that ``The lesseereceives no additional value from these payments which are only incidentallyrelated to the value of the coal through the tax structure. In fact, byadding these taxes to the value of coal, the government is directly placingtaxes on taxes and improperly inflating the royalty payment.'' Many otherindustry comments concurred with the ``taxes on taxes'' objection and statedthat this royalty practice was not the intent of the MLA. Three industryrespondents stated that MMS's proposed definition was inconsistent withthe recommendation contained in the Linowes Commission report entitled``Fair Market Value Policy for Federal Coal Leasing.'' As noted by onecommenter, ``The Commission recommended that `the base for calculatingFederal royalty payments should be f.o.b. price minus all State and localseverance and similar taxes.' ''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has considered both the comments callingfor the reinstatement of reimbursements for the Black Lung Excise Tax andAML fees into the value basis for royalty computation, and all commentsrequesting the further exclusion of all other reimbursements for Stateand local imposed taxes and fees from the value basis of Federal and Indiancoal. The MMS has determined that the definition of gross proceeds is notthe place to address issues as to whether certain payments are royalty-bearing.There is no doubt that when the purchaser pays $10/ton for coal, that isthe lessee's gross proceeds. Whether all of that $10 is royalty-bearingis a separate issue and is addressed below in andSection; 206.257(b).<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters, including States, Indians, and industry,commented that they favored recognizing all forms of consideration receivedby the lessee for purposes of valuing Federal and Indian coal. Some industryrespondents opposed the concept of including all forms of consideration,other than the sales price, as part of gross proceeds. One industry commenterstated that its firm ``provides substantial water to power plant customersbuying coal, without separate consideration for the water.'' Another industrycommenter stated that the concept of collecting royalty on all considerationwas logical, but that MMS was carrying the idea to an extreme. The commentermaintained: ``There may be occasions when there truly is significant considerationgiven to the seller which is not included in the actual sales price ofthe coal. When that is the case, then there is justification to collectroyalty on such consideration.'' This commenter concluded, however, thatthe proposed rules do not define what is significant.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has always required royalty to be paid onall components of coal value, including those components of a coal salesagreement that are not in the form of cash and imbedded in the price. Asstated in the January 15, 1987, proposed rulemaking, ``The definition ofgross proceeds is intended to be expansive to ensure that it includes allthe benefits flowing from the purchaser to, or on behalf of, the sellerfor the disposition of the coal, * * *.'' <T3>Comment:</T3> Eleven industry commenters stated that the use of ``grossproceeds valuation'' does not have a basis in law. One commenter supportedthis position by stating that, ``The words `gross proceeds' do not appearin the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Section 7 of the Act, as amended in1976, established a royalty based on coal's value.'' This reasoning wasexpressed as support in other comments. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> Section 7 of the MLA, as amended by FCLAA, requiresroyalty to be paid on ``the value of coal as defined by regulation.'' Theregulations in effect since 1976 have required royalty to be based on ``grossvalue.'' Although the ``gross proceeds'' term herein is new, it is notforwarding a new concept. The selection of the term ``gross proceeds''is to assure regulatory consistency within MMS and is an excercise of discretionprovided by statute. However, as discussed further below with regard toandSection; 206.157, MMS is proposing certain adjustments to the value ofcoal. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some industry commenters stated that MMS should not usethe gross proceeds established under contracts signed in the 1970's. Onerespondent commented that ``These negotiated coal prices are over-inflatedand not indicative of fair market value. They were contracted during the`oil crisis' and the moratoriums on federal coal leasing.'' The commenteradvocates that MMS ``should develop a method that takes into account theaverage coal price at each mine and does not consider these 1970's contractsas indicative of fair market value.'' Another industry commenter offeredan alternative proposal where royalty would be based on the average priceof a geographic area if ``the current `arm's-length' price exceeds theaverage price for coal sold in the same geographic area by 20 percent ormore * * *.'' <T3>MMS Response:</T3> For arm's-length contracts, MMS does not believethat there is any justification for receiving a royalty based on less thana contract sales price. The lessee receives the benefit of a higher priceand the royalty owner is entitled to share in that benefit. For non-arm's-lengthsituations, a possible exception is addressed later in this preamble. <T3>Comment:</T3> The MMS received many comments from industry respondentsstating that all preparation costs should be excluded from the royaltyvalue. One commenter stated that the value should include ``payments tothe lessee for the extraction, primary crushing, storing, mixing, and loadingcoal * * *. We recommend the exclusion of reimbursements for secondaryprocessing and beneficiation, such as oiling to suppress dust or freezeprevention chemical treatment * * *.'' Several commenters recommended excludingfrom the value for royalty purposes ``processing in excess of that whichis necessary to bring coal to the first point of marketability.'' Othercommenters stated that coal should be valued ``from where it's taken off,the mine at the face * * *.'' One commenter continued to explain that ``variousforms of cleaning or other treatment do not add to the value of the productat the mine.'' Other commenters suggested a similar approach with one statingthat it was inappropriate for MMS ``to collect a royalty on the increasedvalue * * * from * * * crushing, storing, mixing loading [sic], treatmentwith substances including chemicals or oil, and other preparation of thecoal * * *.'' <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The proposed rulemaking would maintain the statusquo of MMS policy. Standard mining and preparation costs would be consideredas part of the mine operation and not be deductible from royalty. Hence,under the approach of the rules, expenses arising from separating the coalfrom the seam, hauling coal from the surface pit or underground face toother mine facilities, crushing coal, sizing or screening coal, storingcoal while awaiting shipment, spraying with oil or with coal antifreezetreatment chemicals, and loading coal at the point of shipment to marketwould be borne 100 percent by the lessee and could not be deducted fromroyalties. <T3>Comment:</T3> One industry commenter stated that it was more reasonableto maintain MMS's current gross value requirement, which is the unit saleor contract price times the number of units sold. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS noted earlier that the concept of coal valuationremains unchanged. The term ``gross proceeds'' has been selected for purposesof regulatory consistency. <T3>Comment:</T3> The MMS received many comments concerning the inclusionof take-or-pay payments in the proposed gross proceeds definition. Fourcommenters, two Indian and two States, expressed support for the inclusionof take-or-pay payments as part of gross proceeds. One commenter reasonedthat the inclusion was proper ``since the other contractual terms may beaffected by inclusion of such language in the selling agreement.'' Anothercommenter stated that gross proceeds ``does not simply mean the amountreceived by the lessee. Rather, it must have an expansive definition toinclude any consideration * * * including any minimum payments, stand-byfees, or take-or-pay payments.'' Other commenters recommended that thegross proceeds definition stand as proposed with respect to including take-or-paypayments, but offered no additional reasoning or support. Industry commenters generally opposed the collection of royalty on take-or-paypayments. Several commenters specifically stated that royalty is due onlyon production; others specifically stated that MMS lacked statutory supportto collect royalty on take-or-pay payments; and some commenters statedthat royalty should be collected on take-or-pay payments only under certaincircumstances. With respect to the issue that royalty is only due on production,one commenter explained that ``if no coal is produced, there is no diminutionin the value of the coal reserve and therefore no royalty should be payable.''Several other commenters took the same position. Another commenter statedthat the ``assessment of royalties on take-or-pay payments is inconsistentwith the traditional framework for royalty payments * * *. The royaltybecomes due only when coal is mined.'' Many commenters urged that the take-or-paypayment serves as a mechanism to cover the producer's investment risk andas such does not constitute a prepayment for Federal coal. Several commenterscontinued by stating that the Government has no right to share in the rewardsresulting from risk of the capital investment. Several commenters declaredthat the proposed regulations were internally inconsistent, with certainparts requiring royalties to be paid on take-or-pay payments not relatedto coal production, while other parts such as andSection;andSection; 206.259,206.255, and 206.257 [now designated andSection;andSection; 206.257, 206.253,and 206.255, respectively] required royalty to be paid on coal producedand sold or otherwise finally disposed of. One commenter also suggestedthat MMS adopt a wait-and-see position and let the courts decide the legalityof collecting royalty or take-or-pay issues. With regard to the comments citing MMS's lack of statutory support to collectroyalties on take-or-pay payments, one commenter noted that ``The plainlanguage of FCLAA (30 U.S.C. 207) ties royalty assessment to the valueof recovered coal.'' Other commenters echoed this view. Another commenterstated that the MLA does not allow royalty collection ``on coal not mined,produced and sold.'' Another commenter stated that ``The statutory authorityto include in production royalties payments made on `take-or-pay' provisionsas if they were `advance royalties' is certainly subject to question.''The commenter further noted that payment of advance royalties is controlledby 30 U.S.C. 207(b). The commenter concluded: ``Since advance royaltiescan only be accepted in lieu of continued operation_one percent of commercialquantities of recoverable coal reserves * * * if an operator is producingthe required one percent, section 6 [of FCLAA] would prohibit the lesseefrom reducing his production royalty payment by the amount of his `take-or-pay'payment, since these payments are not, by statute, considered `advanceroyalties.' '' As noted earlier, several commenters agreed that under certain conditionsroyalty should be collected on take-or-pay payments. One Industry commenterstated: ``Some payments received under `take-or-pay' clauses may well constitutepayments for the disposition of coal produced by the lessee, and in suchcases we agree that they should be subject to royalty.'' Other industry commenters objected to collecting royalty on any other contractuallyrequired compensatory payments, other than take-or-pay, which are not basedon coal production. The commenters referred to such payments as assignmentpayments, prepaid reserve payments, damages awarded by courts, by-outs,bonuses, and capacity charges. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> By collecting royalties on ``take-or-pay'' payments,MMS is not departing from existing coal royalty valuation policy. The collectionof royalty has always been based on the total value of coal sold. The MMSand its predecessor agency, Conservation Division, U.S. Geological Survey,have never permitted royalty to be paid on values reduced by prior take-or-paypayments. The proposed regulation's definition of gross proceeds representeda clarification of existing policy and practice. However, MMS does agreethat no royalty should be paid on a payment which is not for production.See discussion below related to andSection; 206.157(b)(6). The proposed definition of ``gross proceeds'' has been modified to includethe total monies and other consideration ``accruing'' to the lessee. Becausethe definition of arm's-length contract does not include any provisionswhich address the concept that such contracts must reflect the entiretyof the agreement between the parties, MMS concluded that the definitionof gross proceeds should be sufficiently broad to encompass all considerationto which the lessee is entitled. The term ``accruing'' would be intendedto accomplish that purpose. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several industry respondents provided comments regardingthe proposed definition of ``marketable condition.'' One commenter describedthe definition as being so subjective that it was meaningless. Four commentersstated that MMS should regard coal as being in marketable condition ifsold and accepted by the purchaser. One commenter requested clarificationof the meaning of the phrase ``typical sales contract,'' stating ``thereis no such thing as a typical sales contract for an area * * * .'' Onecommenter requested that the entire definition, as proposed, be deleted.Two commenters suggested an alternative definition seeking to define coalas being in marketable condition when it has been extracted, crushed, andscreened. No other processing of coal would be deemed necessary beforebeing considered marketable. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The proposed definition was modified for purposesof clarity. The thrust of the definition is unchanged, as an explicit noticethat MMS will not accept, as an appropriate value for royalty purposes,any value paid for coal which has not been conditioned to meet the minimumrecognized market standard. Finally, the definition of ``net-back method'' has been revised in theproposed rules so that it would be clear that the net-back procedure isto begin from the first downstream point at which value could be ascertainedby reference to arm's-length contracts or other comparable sales.Proposed andSection; 206.253 Coal subject to royalty_general provisions.This section has not been changed signficantly from the first proposedrulemaking.Proposed andSection; 206.254 Quality and quantity measurement standards forreporting and paying royalties.This section has not been changed significantly.Proposed andSection; 206.255 Point of royalty determination.This section has not been changed significantly from the first proposedrulemaking. The term ``used'' has been added to make it clear that useof coal by the lessee triggers the royalty payment obligation.Proposed andSection; 206.256 Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases.This section has not been changed significantly from the first proposedrulemakingProposed andSection; 206.257 Valuation Standards for ad valorem leases.The fundamental approach of this section is the same as in the first proposedrulemaking. However, several changes have been incorporated.Paragraph (a) has been modified slightly. It would continue to providethat value for royalty purposes is the value determined pursuant to thissection less applicable coal washing and transportation allowances, orany other applicable allowances for beneficiation. See discussion of andSection;206.255, above. The paragraph would clarify that the royalty due is equalto the value for royalty purposes multiplied by the royalty rate in thelease.Paragraph (b) still would provide that the value of coal which is soldpursuant to an arm's-length contract will be the gross proceeds accruingto the lessee. Under MMS's existing regulations in 30 CFR 203.250, thelessee's gross proceeds pursuant to an arm's-length contract are acceptableas the value for royalty purposes. The MMS believes that the gross proceedsstandard should be applied to arm's-length sales for several reasons. TheMMS typically accepts this value because it is well grounded in the realitiesof the marketplace where, in most instances, the \7/8\ths owner will striveto obtain the highest attainable price for the coal production for itsown benefit. The royalty owner benefits from this incentive.It also adds more certainty to the valuation process for payors and providesthem with a clear and logical value on which to base royalties. Under theproposed regulations, in most instances, the lessee will not need to beconcerned that several years after the production has been sold MMS willestablish royalty value in excess of the arm's-length contract proceeds,thereby imposing a potential hardship on the lessee. This is particularlya concern for lessees who have long-term arm's-length contracts where salesprices under newer contracts may be higher. If MMS were to establish royaltyvalue based on prices under those newer contracts, (<T3>i.e.</T3>, prices which the lessee cannot obtain under its contract),the resulting royalty obligation could consume a larger percentage of thelessee's proceeds.Establishing gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract as the royaltyvalue also has benefits for MMS and those States that assist MMS in theaudit and enforcement efforts. The gross proceeds standard would give auditorsan objective basis for measuring lessee compliance. It would reduce auditworkload and reduce the administrative appeal burden that results whenvaluation standards are too subjective, particularly when values are determinedto be in excess of a lessee's arm's-length contract gross proceeds.The MMS recognizes, however, that there must be exceptions to the generalrule that the lessee's arm's-length contract price should be accepted withoutquestion as the value for royalty purposes. One such situation is wherethe contract does not reflect all of the consideration flowing either directlyor indirectly from the buyer to the seller. For example, in return forSeller's reduced price for coal production from a Federal lease, Buyermay agree to reduce the price of coal it sells to Seller's affiliate froma non-Federal lease. This agreement is not reflected in the coal salescontract for the Federal coal. In the event that MMS becomes aware of considerationthat exists outside the contract, MMS would adjust the lessee's gross proceedsto reflect the additional consideration. However, in some circumstancesthe additional consideration may not be easily calculable. Thus, even ifthe parties are not affiliated and the contract is ``arm's-length,'' MMScould require in paragraph (b)(2) that the coal production be valued inaccordance with paragraph (c), the standards used to value coal disposedof under non-arm's-length contracts. Under these standards, the lessee'sgross proceeds still may determine value, but the lessee will be requiredto demonstrate comparability to other arm's-length contracts.The MMS recognizes that some parties may have multiple contracts with oneanother. This fact alone would not cause a contract to be treated as non-arm's-length.Rather, there must be some indication that the contract in question doesnot reflect the full agreement between the parties. The proposed regulationsalso include a provision in paragraph (b)(4) whereby MMS may require alessee to certify that the terms of its arm's-length contract reflect allthe consideration flowing from the buyer to the seller for the coal. TheMMS is proposing to include this provision because there may be circumstanceswhere an auditor could not reasonably be expected to find other consideration,yet there is good reason to believe it exists. Because of the potentiallysevere penalties for a false certification, this will assure that no otherconsideration exists when the certification is received.In other situations it may not be apparent why an arm's-length contractprice is unusually low, yet the lessor should not accept the arm's-lengthcontract proceeds as value. It may be because of collusion between thebuyer and seller or improper conduct by the seller, or it could be theresult of a patently imprudent contract. Even if the contract is betweenunaffiliated persons and thus ``arm's-length,'' pursuant to paragraph (b)(3),if MMS determines that the gross proceeds do not reflect the reasonablevalue of the production because of misconduct by the contracting partiesor because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor tomarket the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor,then MMS could require that the coal production be valued pursuant to paragraphs(c)(2) (ii) through (v). Thus, MMS first must determine that a price isunreasonable; for example, by looking at comparable contracts and sales.Then MMS must determine that the unreasonably low price was the resultof misconduct or a breach by the lessee of its duty to market its productionfor the mutual benefit of itself and the lessor.A breach of the lessee's duty to market production to the mutual benefitof the lessor would include, but is not limited to, collusion between theproducer/seller and buyer, pricing practices found by a court or regulatoryauthority to be incorrect or fraudulently manipulated, or negligence innegotiating contracts. The MMS would give a lessee an opportunity to commentwhen it determines the lessee has breached its duty to market the coalfor the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor.The suggestion that the Secretary should determine whether each contractis arm's-length or non-arm's-length was implied in the rules. However,the MMS has added a clarifying provision to paragraph (b)(1) of the proposedrule which would provide that the lessee will have the burden of demonstratingthat its contract is arm's-length. This includes overcoming presumptionsof control where two parties are possibly affiliated.The MMS has determined that the phrase ``or which could accrue'' shouldbe deleted in reference to gross proceeds in paragraph (b)(1). Many commenterson other product value rules thought that this phrase would allow MMS tosecond-guess the price which the lessee agreed to in its contract by arguingthat other persons selling the same product may have received higher prices_thus,more proceeds ``could have accrued'' to the lessee. This was not MMS'spurpose in including the ``or which could accrue'' language in the proposedrule. Rather, MMS's intent is to ensure that royalties are paid on thefull amount to which the lessee is entitled under its contract, not juston the amount of money it may actually receive from its purchaser. However,MMS is satisfied that the phrase ``the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee''properly includes all consideration to which the lessee is entitled underits contract, not necessarily just what it actually receives from the buyer.Therefore, the ``or which could accrue'' phrase was unnecessary. Becauseit caused confusion as to MMS's intent, it is being deleted from the proposedrule.<T3>Comment</T3>: Many industry and State respondents provided commentson alternative valuation methods other than gross proceeds. Several commentersfrom industry advocated adopting some form of a cents-per-million Britishthermal units (Btu) valuation procedure. This valuation procedure wouldestablish a value for Federal and Indian coal based exclusively on thecoal's heating value and would be expressed in cents-per-million Btu. Theactual sale price would not be relevant, nor would other factors such asdistance to market or other quality parameters. In general, these commentersclaimed that this valuation method was simple and fair and that the valuewould be based on the intrinsic heating value of the coal. One commenterstated that the cents-per-million Btu valuation method ``would eliminatethe unfairness, inequities and disparities created by an <T3>ad valorem </T3>rate.'' A number of variations on the theme of cents-per-millionBtu valuation were offered. Some commenters recommended initially fixingthe dollar amount per million Btu and then adjusting ``for inflation ordeflation at regular intervals'' by use of an ``appropriate index.'' Onecommenter specified that whatever index was used ``could be set nationally.''One commenter stated that MMS should use a cents-per-million Btu base value,but ``this value should reflect the `value of the coal at the mine mouth.''' One industry and one State respondent opposed using a cents-per-millionBtu royalty valuation method. The State commenter noted that the conceptwas not simple, because to make the method fair ``you would have to bringsome other quality factors into the coal that are going to have an effecton the value of it at the burner.'' The industry commenter expressed concernabout abandoning the free market concept. One other industry commentersuggested that the first sentence of paragraph (b) be rewritten to read:``The value of coal for royalty purposes shall be determined by the MMSon the basis of Btus per ton on a regional basis through regulation thatsets fair and reasonable values.'' The commenter elaborated, stating thatvalue should be independent of factors such as time of contract execution,contract provisions, unit taxes, and transportation competitiveness.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The basic premise of MMS's royalty calculation methodsis that royalty should be based on the value received by the lessee underan arm's-length contract for selling the coal (less allowances). The Btu-basedroyalty concept is neither easy to implement nor conducive to equitableadministration. It is not easy to implement because MMS would be chargedwith the responsibility to establish, using some rational method, an initialvalue per million Btu. The MMS believes such an undertaking could easilyconsume all the limited manpower resources of MMS without achieving aninitial credible and tenable value. The Btu-based royalty concept wouldbe inequitable to many lessees because the royalty value would be unresponsiveto the sulfur content or other quality parameters affecting the value ofFederal or Indian coal. The MMS maintains that the free market value establishedby an arm's-length sale is the best measure of coal value for royalty purposes.As discussed above, MMS is proposing as an option for public comment aparagraph (b)(5) which would provide that notwithstanding the provisionsof any other regulations in Subpart F, the value of coal would be reducedby the amounts of Federal Black Lung Excise Taxes and Abandoned Mine LandsFees (AML fees) authorized by the Surface Mining Control and ReclamationAct of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which are paid for the coal. Thus, if a coal contractprovides that the purchaser is to reimburse the lessee for Black Lung andAML fees, those amounts would be part of gross proceeds, but paragraph(b)(5) nevertheless would not require the payment of royalty on those amounts.Similarly, even if a coal contract does not have a separate reimbursementclause, the lessee could reduce the value of coal for royalty payment purposesby the amount of Black Lung and AML fees the lessee is required to payfor the coal production. For example, if the lessee's arm's-length contractrequires a flat payment of $5.00 per ton, then $5.00 is the lessee's grossproceeds. However, if the lessee is required to pay $0.57 in Black Lungand AML fees, then the effect of paragraph (b)(5) would be to reduce thevalue of the coal to $4.43.While it is well-established that the lessee's gross proceeds include allpayments for coal production, including reimbursements received eitherdirectly or indirectly by the lessee (<T3>see, e.g. Knife River Coal Mining Co.,</T3> 29 IBLA 26 (Feb. 8, 1977);<T3>Knife River Coal Mining Co., </T3> 43 IBLA 104 (Sept. 24, 1979); and<T3>Hoover andamp; Bracken Energies, Inc. </T3>v.<T3> DOI,</T3> 723 F.2d 1488 (10th Cir. 1983), <T3/><T3>cert. denied,</T3> 469 U.S. 821 (1984)), payments for Black Lung andAML fees are distinguishable from other types of fees or costs imposedon coal producers or on coal production because these are fees imposedby the Federal Government, the lessor. Thus, the lessor could raise itsroyalty revenues by imposing or increasing such fees. For this reason,MMS would like comment on whether it would be appropriate to reduce thevalue of coal for royalty payment purposes by the amounts the lessee mustpay for such fees and, therefore, pass on to its purchaser.The MMS also is proposing that the provisions of paragraph (b)(5) wouldnot be applicable to Indian tribal and allotted leases. It is MMS's intentionthat these rules be revenue neutral for Indian leases. Also, since theIndian lessor does not impose the AML and Black Lung taxes, the above-statedrationale for excluding these fees from royalty value (<T3>i.e., </T3>that the lessor can increase royalties by imposing or increasingthese taxes) does not apply to Indian leases. The MMS specifically wouldlike comment whether the proposed exclusion language will be sufficientto ensure that the exception provided by paragraph (b)(5) will not be applicableto existing Indian leases.The MMS received many comments that the value of coal also should be reducedby amounts for State severance taxes. Most of the arguments were similarto those for the AML fee and Black Lung Tax exclusion. Although excludingseverance taxes from value would be a departure from long established Departmentalpolicy, MMS would like further comment on whether it should add a deductionfor State severance taxes to paragraph (b)(5). It would be MMS's intentnot to grant a deduction for State severance taxes from the value applicableto coal production from Indian leases.The MMS received many comments from industry that it is inappropriate toimpose a royalty burden on that portion of the value of coal which becomesthe royalty payment; <T3>i.e.,</T3> industry claims that a royalty on royalty is unfair. Thisissue can best be understood by an example. Assume a lease with a 12.5percent royalty rate. Assume that the lessee sells 100,000 tons of coalunder an arm's-length contract at $10 per ton for a total of $1,000,000.Historically, MMS would consider the value for royalty purposes to be the$1,000,000 and would require a royalty payment of 12.5 percent or $125,000.Those who advocate that it is unfair to pay royalty on royalty first woulddivide the proceeds by 1.125 to remove the royalty portion of the proceeds($1,000,000 divided by 1.125= $888,888.88). The result then would be multipliedby the royalty rate to determine the royalty payment ($888,888.88 andmultiply;.125=$111,111.11). The MMS is not proposing regulatory language on thissuggested exclusion but, in view of the many comments received, MMS wouldlike public comment on whether it should include in the final rule a provisionwhich would reduce the value of coal by an amount equal to the differencebetween: (1) the value of the coal; and (2) the value of the coal dividedby (1 + the royalty rate). This provision also would result in reducedroyalty values in situations where the lessee has a royalty reimbursementprovision in its contract.As discussed above, the definition of gross proceeds includes paymentsmade under take-or-pay clauses in contracts and similar clauses which MMSconsiders to be consideration for production. Paragraph (b)(6) would reflectthe fact that the purchaser may make certain payments to a lessee underthe contract that are not part of the total amount or consideration whichthe purchaser pays for the purchase of the product. For example, paymentsmade for lessee provided services that are totally unrelated to the productionand sale of coal would not be regarded as part of the total effective pricepaid for coal purchases under the contract. By way of contrast, if thecontract required the purchaser to continue to make payments for certainmine operation costs, such payments would be royalty-bearing.The MMS recognizes that coal sales contracts may contain provisions thatare unique in form to that contract and the effect of which must be examinedon the specific facts of the transaction. Ordinarily, payments made undercontract clauses that allocate the risk of production and the risk of marketdemand and ensure a minimum return to the seller for the sale of the product(i.e., take-or-pay clauses and similar clauses) are part of the total considerationpaid for the product and are royalty-bearing. In all instances, the substanceof the contract clause or payment involved, and not its form, will control.In the comments received from industry, many different types of paymentswere identified and questions raised as to whether they would be royaltybearing. These include:1. Damages recovered under a court judgment for the purchaser's breachof the sales contract;2. Payments made under a force majeure clause;3. ``Settlement'' payments made to terminate a sales contract before thecontractually-specified termination date; this includes situations wherethere may or may not be a follow-on contract;4. Payments for assignment of an interest in the lease;5. Payments not designated as part of the purchase price but made on aperiodic or regularly scheduled basis under the contract;6. Payments not designated as part of the purchase price, which may ormay not vary with the amount of coal delivered, and paid on a one-timeor not regularly scheduled basis under the contract in a specific sum orcalculated under a prescribed formula;7. Payments or reimbursements for services or processing costs customarilythe responsibility of the lessee, including that required to put the productin marketable condition;8. Minimum payment obligations, price guarantees, or deficiency charges;and9. Payments which are accepted by public service commissions as made forpurposes other than for coal received.The MMS specifically solicits comment on whether payments or reimbursementsin these categories constitute part of the total consideration paid forthe purchase of the product. Under the proposed provision, the lessee wouldhave the opportunity to demonstrate that, under the terms of its contract,the payment made was not part of the consideration for production. However,unless MMS concurs with the lessee's position, royalty payment will bedue on that payment.Paragraph (c) would apply to coal production that is not sold pursuantto an arm's-length contract. Valuation benchmarks would have to be consideredin the prescribed order with the value based upon the first applicablebenchmark. The first benchmark is still based upon the lessee's gross proceedsfrom the disposition of the coal. However, the proposed rule has been modifedso that, before the lessee's gross proceeds would be acceptable as value,they must be equivalent not just to the gross proceeds under the lessee'sother arm's-length contracts, but they must be equivalent to the grossproceeds under arm's-length contracts involving other buyers and sellersin the area. The effect of this change is to combine what previously werethe first and second benchmarks and broaden the base of comparability inthe first benchmark. The other provisions of the first benchmark, includingthe comparability criteria, are not changed.Where value is determined based on the benchmarks, the adjustments fromandSection;andSection; 206.257(b) (5) and (6), if adopted, would apply. Theseadjustments, which have been proposed for comment, relate to amounts forsuch costs as AML fees, Black Lung Taxes, State severance taxes, and theroyalty-on-royalty issue. This would apply both where there is a reimbursementclause for these costs and where the cost is embedded in a net price. Insome cases it may not be appropriate to make any further deduction forthese items, for example, where the value determined under the benchmarksalready does not include a state severance tax component.The MMS received many comments on the benchmarks. However, there was noone issue that received considerable comment. The MMS will address thecomments in the final rulemaking.The remaining benchmarks for valuing coal disposed of under non-arm's-lengthcontracts were not changed.It has come to MMS's attention that there may exist a disparity betweenthe current market value of coal and the prices for coal paid under contractsbetween affiliates (e.g., a coal mining company owned by an electric utility)which, in many instances, are based on mining costs. In today's environment,mining costs often exceed the price for which coal can be sold in the marketplace.Some coal industry members have questioned whether it is reasonable touse these ``gross proceeds'' as a royalty value, or whether value shouldbe based upon factors that more contemporaneously reflect the coal's valuein the open market.For mine-mouth or captive mine situations, the coal industry has commentedthat in today's weak market MMS should not receive a royalty computed ona cost-based contract that exists between affiliates. Therefore, MMS specificallyrequests comments on whether the final rules should include a provisionwhereby royalty value for non-arm's-length sales in mine mouth or captivemine situations should be based principally on current market determinants(such as spot prices) which several coal industry commenters advocated.Paragraph (d) has been modified from the first proposal. Paragraph (d)(1)still would provide that value determinations under paragraph (c) do notrequire MMS's prior approval. However, the lessee would be required toretain all data that would be subject to review and audit. The MMS coulddirect a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the lessee'sreported value is inconsistent with the requirements of the regulations.Paragraph (d)(2) would require a lessee to make sales and sales quantitydata available to authorized MMS, State, and Indian representatives, tothe Inspector General of the Department of the Interior, and to other authorizedpersons.Paragraph (d)(3) would continue to provide a notification requirement ifa lessee determined value using the second through fifth benchmarks.Paragraph (e) has been added to clarify that if a lessee improperly determinesvalue, it would be liable for both the additional royalties and interest.The first proposed rule included a provision in paragraph (h) that lesseescould request value determinations from MMS. That provision now is in paragraph(f).Proposed paragraph (g) establishes gross proceeds as a minimum value. Thisprovision is unchanged from the first proposal except that the specificreference to gross proceeds ``which could accrue'' was deleted. The reasonfor this change was discussed above with regard to paragraph (b)(1).Paragraph (h), which requires the lessee to place coal in marketable conditionat no cost to the lessor, is unchanged from the first proposal. The MMSspecifically requests comments on whether or not this section, plus thedefinition of marketable condition, requires further development in thesecoal regulations to provide better guidance for the lessee. Commentersare requested to provide specific suggestions for changes to the regulatorylanguage.Paragraph (i) imposes a diligence requirement on lessees. This sectionwould require a lessee to pay royalty in accordance with its contract price,but also expressly would recognize that contract prices may be amendedretroactively. Retroactive price adjustments would be limited to 2 years.The MMS is aware that often there is a process of negotiation that occursbefore the contract is formally amended and that lower payments may bereceived in the interim. Royalties may be paid on the gross proceeds receivedby the lessee until all reasonable attempts to force the purchaser to renegotiatethe contract or to comply with the existing contract are exhausted, providedthe lessee takes proper and timely action to receive prices or benefitsto which it is entitled, or to revise the contract retroactively. Thus,the MMS will accept a renegotiated or a revised contract price if the mainreason for renegotiating or revising the contract is not solely to reduceroyalties. However, if a higher price can be legally enforceable undera contract and the lessee is not diligent in obtaining that price, royaltieswill be due on that higher price.The MMS has added a new paragraph (j) to the proposed rules which wouldprovide that, in those situations where MMS may make a preliminary valuedetermination in the course of monitoring compliance with these regulations,the determination will not be binding until MMS has done an audit and theaudit formally is closed. The MMS intends to issue further guidelines onwhen an audit is closed.Paragraph (k) includes some minor changes to the paragraph originally proposedas paragraph (i).Proposed andSection; 206.258 Washing allowances_general.The MMS received many comments on the limitations on washing allowancescontained in the first proposed rule. Industry generally objected to anylimit on allowances. Most State and Indian commenters thought the limitswere not sufficiently restrictive. In this further notice of proposed rulemaking,MMS is not proposing a threshold requiring MMS approval to exceed thatthreshold. The purpose of a threshold is to assist MMS in monitoring allowances.Because there are few coal leases, and only a small number of those coalleases involve washing allowances, MMS does not believe that a thresholdwould be necessary to monitor the reasonableness of allowances. In fact,MMS is aware of only one instance where a washing allowance would haveexceeded the threshold. The rules would continue to provide that a washingallowance could not reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.The MMS also has added a paragraph which would clarify that, if a lesseeimproperly determines a washing allowance, the lessee would be liable forany additional royalties plus interest.Proposed andSection; 206.259 Determination of washing allowances.If a lessee has an arm's-length contract for coal washing under paragraph(a), the allowance would be the reasonable actual costs incurred by thelessee. This paragraph was not changed from the first proposal, but MMShas added two new paragraphs to address situations where a contract, thougharm's-length, should be treated as non-arm's-length pursuant to paragraph(b). The first situation is where MMS determines that the coal washingcontract reflects more than the consideration transferred from the lesseeto the wash plant operator for the washing; i.e., the washing cost hasbeen inflated. The second situation is where the MMS determines that therehas been misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because thelessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the productionfor the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor. The types of misconductor breach of duty that would trigger application of these provisions areessentially the same as those discussed above in the valuation section.Paragraph (b), which is applicable to non-arm's-length coal washing situations,has not been changed significantly from the first proposal. It would continueto be a cost-based determination. The MMS has made some changes to theprovisions relating to reporting of allowances in response to commentsthat the first proposal was somewhat unclear. Under paragraph (b)(1), nowashing allowance may be taken before a Form MMS-4292 is filed. Washingallowances may be claimed retroactively for a period of 3 months priorto the month the form is filed. Thus, if a lessee takes an allowance forJanuary, February, and March but does not file the form until April 15,the lessee will be entitled to the allowance but will owe interest forthe time period that it was taken before it was authorized.The MMS received many comments on the rate of return to be used in thecost computation. Paragraph (b)(2)(v) now would provide that the rate ofreturn will be the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor'sBBB rating. This is the same rate adopted in the oil and gas rules, andthe preambles provide an extensive explanation of this issue (Oil_53 FR1212-1214; Gas_53 FR 1262-1263). However, as noted in those preambles,MMS is preparing a notice of proposed rulemaking to again address the rateof return issue.In the gas processing regulations, MMS provided an exception to the cost-basedapproach in certain circumstances where the plant operator provides servicesunder arm's-length contracts. See 30 CFR 206.159(b)(4). The MMS requestscomments on whether or not a similar provision should be included for coalwashing.As noted above, MMS has modified the reporting requirements in paragraph(c). This paragraph generally is self-explanatory. One change is that washingallowances in effect on the effective date of the regulations would beallowed to continue until their termination date.Section 206.260 Allocation of washed coal.This section was not changed from the first proposal.Proposed andSection; 206.261 Transportation allowances_general.This section would provide generally for a transportation allowance whencoal is not sold at the mine or wash plant near the mine. The MMS receivedmany comments on transportation allowances from industry, States and Indians.<T3>Comment: </T3>Indian commenters recommended that paragraph (a) providefor a negotiated allowance for Indian lessors. One of these commentersexplained that ``certain transportation costs, unless cited in the lease,are a matter of negotiated settlement between the lessor and lessee andnot subject to an arbitrary allowance.'' The other Indian commenter statedthat transportation allowances were a reversal of past MMS practice andwould be difficult to administer. This commenter stated, ``Transportationcosts should simply not be deducted from the value on which a company paysroyalties to the Tribes.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS and its predecessor agency, the ConservationDivision, U.S. Geological Survey, have maintained a policy of providingcoal transportation allowances to lessees that transport coal to distantpoints of sale at their own expense. As a matter of policy, MMS considersthe assessment of ad valorem royalty on sale prices inclusive of valueadded by transportation to be an improper royalty practice leading to disincentivesfor the lessee to seek out and exploit all available markets. Unless specificallyprohibited by lease terms, these rules would continue the past practiceof allowing deductions for those selling arrangements that specify remotepoints of sale.<T3>Comment: </T3>Paragraph (b)(1) of the original proposed rules, whichestablishes thresholds on transportation allowances, received numerouscomments. Many industry commenters objected to any limit for transportationallowances. One industry commenter maintained that ``Any standard otherthan actual transportation costs is arbitrary and places the burden onindustry to then apply for a full deduction.'' Another industry commentercharacterized the limit ``to be an arbitrary amount intended for the solepurpose of increasing royalties.'' One industry commenter stated that ``Thecoal mine operator should have the freedom to be able to market its productwherever possible without the requirement to obtain the approval of theDirector when transportation costs exceed the value of the coal.'' Over20 commenters offered similar rationales, most stating there was no justificationto any limit.One industry commenter suggested the 50- and 75-percent limits of the proposedrules ``should be established as a guideline only so that MMS can freelyexercise its authority to allow charges in excess of these amounts.''State and Indian respondents opposed the limits of paragraph (b)(1) citingthat the limits are too high. A State commenter recommended reducing allowancelimits to 33-35 percent and explained, ``It has been our experience thatpublished acceptable allowances or deductible expenses often become selffulfilling [sic] prophecies providing targets to be attained by some lessees.''The Indian commenter maintained that the 75-percent limit for combinedwashing and transportation was too high and recommended that the limitnot exceed 50 percent of the value of the coal.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The 50- and 75-percent transportation allowancethresholds that were initially proposed are not retained in these proposedrules. The purpose of a threshold is to assist MMS in monitoring the reasonablenessof allowances. Because there are few coal leases, and only a few of thoseinvolve significant transportation allowances, MMS does not believe thata threshold or limit is necessary. The rules would provide that the allowancescannot reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.<T3>Comment: </T3>One Indian commenter stated the proposed regulationsdid not clearly prohibit leases with cents-per-ton royalty terms from receivingtransportation allowances.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Allowances for cents-per-ton leases are specificallyprohibited by the regulations at andSection; 206.256(c).Section 205.261(c) would provide that lessees would not be required toallocate costs between coal and waste products. Allowances would be permittedfor the total tonnage transported, even for coal that is transported toa wash plant for washing.The MMS has reviewed all the comments received to date. Section 206.262is being proposed again with only minor modifications from the first proposal.Proposed andSection; 206.262 Determination of transportation allowances.This section was proposed initially as paragraph (d) of the transportationallowance section. The MMS has added a separate section for clarity andto simplify numbering.This section has not been changed significantly from the first proposedrules. Some changes were made to the reporting requirements and effectivedate mechanisms for ease of understanding. These and other changes aresimilar to those made to the washing allowance rules that were discussedabove. Likewise, many of the comments received on this section were similarto those received for washing allowances, such as comments addressing rateof return.Pursuant to this section, MMS generally would accept arm's-length transportationcosts. The MMS also has added two new paragraphs to address situationswhere a contract, though arm's-length, should be treated as non-arm's-lengthpursuant to paragraph (b). The first situation is where MMS determinesthat the transportation contract reflects more than the consideration transferredfrom the lessee to the transporter for the transportation; i.e., the transportationcost has been inflated. The second situation is where MMS determines thatthere has been misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or becausethe lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market theproduction for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor. The typesof misconduct or breach of duty that would trigger application of theseprovisions are essentially the same as those discussed above in the valuationsection.For non-arm's-length contracts, the allowance generally would be basedupon the lessee's reasonable actual costs for transportation. The costcalculation procedure has not been changed from the initial proposal. TheMMS also is proposing to add a new paragraph (b)(3) whereby the lesseecould apply to MMS for an exception from the requirement that it computeactual costs if the lessee has a transportation rate approved by a regulatoryauthority and the rate is not excessive as compared to other arm's-lengthcontracts. If there are no other arm's-length contracts to use for comparison,other criteria apply.The MMS also received some comments that provision should be made for newtechnology transportation systems which may justify a different type ofallowance procedure or a means for modifying the proposed procedure, suchas allowing for a greater rate of return on investment for the increasedrisk. The MMS would like comment on this issue, describing the new technologyand what provisions should be added to the rules.Discussion of the Coal and Electric Utility Industries' Proposal for ValuingFederal and Indian Coal.On July 9, 1987, the Department reopened the coal comment period for 14days. During this second comment period, the Department received additionalsignificant comments from principal interested parties raising issues thatmerited further consideration and response from the public. To allow forthis further consideration, the Department, once again, reopened the commentperiod on August 12, 1987, for 60 days to give interested persons an opportunityto obtain from DOI copies of three specific comments received from industry,State, and Indian representatives and then to provide a response for DOIto consider in developing a final rulemaking.<T3>Comment: </T3>The industry comments were submitted as a joint proposalby six groups representing the coal producers and electric utilities. Thisproposal included a comprehensive, section-by-section set of revisionsto the January proposed rulemaking, including a justification for the suggestedmodifications. The most significant revision in the joint industry proposalis to set aside the valuation standards contained in MMS's January 15,1987, proposed rulemaking and substitute, instead, the concepts of ``grossroyalty value'' and ``net royalty value.'' Industry stated the basis fortheir proposal is the Internal Revenue Code's (IRC) concept of ``grossincome from property'' as used for depletion allowance calculations (IRC613). This ``gross royalty value'' would be increased by amounts for non-Federalroyalties and reduced by processing allowances and amounts based on FederalBlack Lung excise taxes, Abandoned Mine Land fees, and State and localtaxes (such as severance taxes). The resulting figure would be the ``netroyalty value'' upon which royalties would be paid. The ``gross royaltyvalue'' would exclude outbound (long-distance) transportation costs incurredwith f.o.b. destination sales. ``Gross royalty value'' would also excludetake-or-pay payments for royalty assessment.The Department has received considerable comments on the joint industryproposal. A letter from Governor Schwinden of Montana, representing hisviews and those of the Governors of Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming,generally opposed the joint industry proposal and supported continued relianceon the proposed valuation procedures. Several Governors subsequently wroteindividual letters to express personal opinions where their views differedfrom that of the consensus view. Governor Sullivan of Wyoming and GovernorRomer of Colorado indicated they could support exclusion of royalty reimbursementsfrom gross proceeds to address the ``royalty on royalty'' issue.Governor Sinner of North Dakota urged the Department to continue the ongoingreview of product valuation and expressed specific concerns regarding theproduction of lignite in his State.Numerous comments were submitted by electric utility firms and from Governorsof States that consume substantial quantities of western coal production.These commenters urged adoption of the joint industry proposal, statingthat the joint industry proposal would reduce fuel costs, which in turnwould reduce consumer electricity costs. Some commenters supported thevaluation proposal by rationalizing that a reduced valuation basis wouldcompensate for the increased ad valorem royalty rates now required underthe MLA.No Indian Tribe or allottee submitted written comments concerning the jointindustry proposal. However, Mr. Donald R. Wharton, Assistant Attorney Generalfor Natural Resources, The Navajo Nation, offered comments to the Subcommitteeon Mineral Resources Development and Production during the Oversight Hearingon Proposed Coal Product Valuation Rules on November 16, 1987. Mr. Whartonopposed the joint industry proposal, stating: ``Industry's deletion ofthe concept of `gross proceeds' for royalty payment purposes is inconsistentwith the concept underlying the present valuation regulations_that royaltiesfrom <T3>ad valorem </T3>leases be based on a percentage of gross proceeds.We urge MMS to retain the `gross proceeds' methodology for valuation.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The Department expended considerable effort in reviewingthe joint industry proposal. Representatives from MMS and from the Departmentmet separately with representatives of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)to discuss the operation of the ``gross income from property'' rules andthe computation of the percentage depletion allowance. Also, analysts inthe MMS reviewed the potential advantages and disadvantages of revenueproblems that could arise if the joint industry proposal were adopted asthe basis of coal royalty valuation. The MMS analysts solicited input fromStates and coordinated with principal industry representatives to arriveat a mutually agreed upon range of royalty revenue amounts that would,in the collective judgment of the States, MMS, and industry, most likelyoccur if the joint industry proposal were accepted.Following this extensive review, MMS decided not to adopt the joint industryproposal. The following reasoning is provided to explain MMS's decision.1. <T3>The Joint Industry Proposal is not Readily Adaptable to Lease Accounting.</T3>The MMS is required to collect and account for royalties on a lease basis.Royalty rates may vary from lease to lease; prices will vary from contractto contract; and contracts may dedicate specific reserves. The IRS determinationis made on a taxpayer basis, which would be an aggregate, at least, ofall leases and contracts for a single mine, and could conceivably encompassmore than one mining operation. Thus, the industry proposal seems to beinconsistent with the basis on which MMS must collect and account for royalties.Making the proposal consistent with MMS needs would require that MMS developan allocation procedure to convert depletable income to a lease basis.Such a procedure would likely be expensive and require the use of simplifyingassumptions to the extent of being unacceptable.2. <T3>Joint Industry Proposal Has No Relation to Historical Federal RoyaltyValuation Practices.</T3>The Joint Industry Proposal introduces a royalty valuation concept thathas never been used in the valuation of any leasable mineral. The JointIndustry Proposal valuation concept is not consistent with the Departmentof the Interior's current valuation procedure for coal. Also, the JointIndustry Proposal is inconsistent with existing royalty valuation proceduresfor noncoal solid minerals; e.g., sodium and potassium, which have notbeen substantially revised since 1978.3. <T3>Joint Industry Proposal Has No Relation to Prior Statutory Interpretation.</T3>The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (Act), as amended specifically by the FederalCoal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976, requires that:<ITAG tagnum="21">A lease shall require payment of a royalty in such amount as the Secretaryshall determine of not less than 12\1/2\ per centum of the value of coalas defined by regulation, except the Secretary may determine a lesser amountin the case of coal recovered by underground mining operations.</ITAG>The Act and leases issued under the Act do not define value, gross value,gross proceeds, or value of production, or how to arrive at those values.However, a long history of royalty valuation rulemaking for all leasableminerals shows a consistent adherence to common principles of valuation.The Joint Industry Proposal departs from previous administrative interpretationsof legislation and in this regard strays from ``original intent'' thathas been established by longstanding practice.4. <T3>The Joint Industry Proposal Creates New Auditing Problems.</T3>The Joint Industry Proposal would be a new and complex approach to coalroyalty value determinations. It is significantly different from the existingvaluation methodology used for coal and other minerals. As a result, MMS(as well as State and Indian) auditors would be required to relearn anentirely new system. This necessarily would delay many audits.Proposed andSection; 206.263 Contract submission.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 206.263(a), which requires sales contract submittalupon MMS request, received many industry comments and one Indian comment.All comments except the one Indian comment opposed the submittal requirement.The Indian commenter recommended ``No changes'' to the language of thissection. Most industry commenters stated that MMS should have free accessfor review of contracts at the lessee's place of business. In objectingto the requirement of possible contract submittal, one industry commenterstated that ``Coal supply agreements contain extremely proprietary information,which, if divulged to the public and/or competitors, can have a significantlynegative impact upon both the coal buyer and the coal seller.'' Anotherindustry commenter expressed the same concern, stating that if contractsare sent to MMS, it would ``unnecessarily increase the risk of unwarranteddisclosure of highly confidential, proprietary information * * *.'' Again,another industry commenter addressed similar fears of contract disclosureby MMS and recommended that the entire section be deleted from the regulations.One industry commenter stated that the ``Royalty Management Advisory Committeerecommended that contracts be reviewed on site.'' One industry commenterquestioned the need for contract submittal, stating that ``it is our understandingthat MMS is developing its own financial audit team, through which allnecessary contractual information could be obtained.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS intends to review contracts during on-siteaudits. However, the MMS must retain the right to obtain sales contractsor other agreements from Federal or Indian lessees. The MMS will take allnecessary precautions to safeguard contracts from unauthorized disclosure.The section has not been changed from the first proposal, except for somewording changes.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 206.263(b), which requires lessees to designateeach submitted contract as arm's-length or non-arm's-length, received sixcomments. Industry commenters recommended deleting the phrase ``submittedpursuant to this section'' in order to be consistent with similar recommendationsfor paragraph (a). An Indian commenter stated that ``Any contract submittedshould be available to the [Indian] lessors also under paragraph (b).''The same Indian respondent maintained that ``there should be some priordetermination by MMS as to whether a contract is arm's-length or not insteadof leaving the matter up to the lessee subject to audit to verify thatthe contract meets the criteria.'' One industry commenter recommended revisingparagraph (b) to read: ``Lessees and other payors shall designate eachcontract that is non-arm's-length.'' No rationale was supplied to supportthis recommendation.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>When warranted, the MMS will make submitted contractsavailable to Indian lessors who certify that proprietary industry informationin the contracts will be safeguarded. Regarding the issue of a lessee determiningwhether or not a contract is arm's-length, the MMS stresses that a lessee'sdetermination of the arm's-length nature of a contract is not conclusive.Under paragraph (c), MMS may audit any contract to determine its characterunder the definition at andSection; 206.251.Proposed andSection; 206.264 In-situ and surface gasification and liquefactionoperations.This section is changed only slightly from the first proposed rule.Proposed andSection; 206.265 Value enhancement of marketable coal.The MMS is proposing to add a section which provides guidance to royaltyvaluation involving beneficiation beyond marketable condition by the lessee.This section would not be applicable in situations where a lessee sellsits coal, in marketable condition, pursuant to an arm's-length contractand the purchaser performs the enhancement. In that circumstance, valuewould be determined by the lessee's gross proceeds pursuant to andSection;206.257(b).This new section would provide generally that, if a lessee further processescoal (after placing it in marketable condition) to enhance its value priorto use, sale, or other disposition, royalties would be based on the valueof the coal in marketable condition prior to enhancement.The MMS received many industry comments that any valuation procedure forbeneficiated coal must allow the lessee to recover the full costs of itsactivities. The focus of most concerns was that in the usual situationwhere MMS determines value based upon the sales price of the product lessa processing allowance, the typical MMS-allowed rate of return does notpermit the lessee to fully recover its investment, hence the MMS benefitsfrom the beneficiated coal without having made any investment. The MMShas revised its proposal to address this concern and would like furthercomment on this issue.As stated above, this section would apply to situations where the valueof the coal is enhanced beyond the point of marketable condition priorto use, sale, or other disposition by the lessee. The purpose of the proposalis to attempt to establish royalty value at the point when the coal hasbeen placed in marketable condition but prior to its enhancement.The first method to be applied would be to determine the value of the feedstockcoal in marketable condition by application of the valuation benchmarksin andSection; 206.257(c). Thus, MMS would consider the royalty value reportedby the lessee and compare it to the values identified under the applicablebenchmarks to determine the reasonableness of the value assigned by thelessee.If the first four benchmarks cannot be applied, then MMS would use andSection;206.257(c)(v), or the net-back method. However, MMS would permit an allowancethat is different than the normal net-back approach. This approach, tobe seen as a last resort, determines royalty value after the marketablecoal has been enhanced and is subsequently used, sold, or otherwise transferred.Under this net-back procedure, the MMS would begin with the gross proceedsaccruing to the lessee from sales of the beneficiated coal. This amountwould be reduced by MMS-approved processing costs. In recognition of thegreater risk associated with coal beneficiation technologies and so asnot to discourage their development, MMS is proposing to use a rate ofreturn on investment (in doing the net-back procedure) that would be equalto two times the Standard and Poor's BBB bond rate applicable under andSection;206.259(b)(2)(v). The MMS specifically requests comments on the appropriatenessof the proposed rate of return.The MMS believes that using the approach described above for royalty purposeswill accomplish MMS's goal of receiving the value of production in thiscircumstance, while assuring that the benefits associated with investmentsin beneficiation activities remain solely with the lessee. By first usingthe benchmarks to value feedstock coal in these situations, MMS ensuresthat market conditions are reflected in the royalty determination, thusminimizing the use of non-market approaches.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

Procedural Matters</ITAG>Executive Order 12291The Department of the Interior (DOI) has determined that this documentis not a major rule and does not require a regulatory analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. This rulemaking consolidates Federal and Indian coal royaltyvaluation regulations; clarifies DOI coal royalty valuation and coal transportationand coal washing allowance policy; and provides for consistent royaltyvaluation policy among all leasable minerals.Regulatory Flexibility ActBecause this rule primarily consolidates and streamlines existing regulationsinto a single part for consistent application, there are no significantadditional requirements or burdens placed upon small business entitiesas a result of implementation of this rule. Therefore, the DOI has determinedthat this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities and does not require a regulatory flexibilityanalysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980The information collection requirements contained in andSection;andSection;206.254, 206.257, 206.259, 206.262, and 206.263 of this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501et seq. and assigned clearance numbers 1010-0040, -0063, -0064, and -0074.National Environmental Policy Act of 1969It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand that a detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>30 CFR Part 202Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 203Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 206Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 212Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.43 CFR Part 3480Government contracts, Intergovernmental relations, Land Management Bureau,Mineral royalties, Mines, Public lands-mineral resources, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

Value may not be less than the gross proceeds accruingto the lessee, including the additional consideration.(3) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lesseepursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable valueof the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties,or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor tomarket the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor,then MMS shall require that the coal production be valued pursuant to paragraph(c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, and in accordance withthe notification requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. WhenMMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify thelessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written informationjustifying the lessee's reported coal value.(4) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length contractprovisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the buyer, eitherdirectly or indirectly, for the coal.(5) Notwithstanding any other regulations in this subpart, except for Indianleases the value of coal shall be reduced by the amounts of Federal BlackLung excise taxes and abandoned mine lands fees authorized by the SurfaceMining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq</T3>.), applicable to the coal production.(6) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include paymentsreceived by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee demonstrates,to MMS's satisfaction, were not part of the total consideration paid forthe purchase of coal.(c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and whichis not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be determined inaccordance with this section.(2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to paragraph(b) of this section, then the value shall be determined through applicationof other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be considered in the followingorder, and the value shall be based upon the first applicable criterion:(i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale underits non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition by other than an arm's-lengthcontract), provided that those gross proceeds are equivalent to the grossproceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable arm's-length contractsfor sales, purchases, or other dispositions of like-quality coal in thearea. In evaluating the comparabilty of arm's-length contracts for thepurposes of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered:price, time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, qualityof coal, quantity, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflectthe value of the coal; (ii) prices reported for that coal to a public utilitycommission; (iii) prices reported for that coal to the Energy InformationAdministration of the Department of Energy; (iv) other relevant mattersincluding, but not limited to, published or publicly available spot marketprices, or information submitted by the lessee concerning circumstancesunique to a particular lease operation or the saleability of certain typesof coal; (v) if a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraphs(c)(2) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, then a net-back methodor any other reasonable method shall be used to determine value.(3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) ofthis section, that value shall be subject to the adjustments provided inparagraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6), as appropriate.(d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of thissection, that value does not require MMS's prior approval. However, thelessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS will direct a lesseeto use a different value if it determines that the reported value is inconsistentwith the requirements of these regulations.(2) Any Federal or Indian lessee will make available upon request to theauthorized MMS, State, or Indian representatives, or to the Inspector Generalof the Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receivesuch information, arm's-length sales and sales quantity data for like-qualitycoal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the area.(3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to paragraphs(c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section. The notification shallbe by letter to the Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/herdesignee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used andcontain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The notificationrequired by this section is a one-time notification due no later than themonth the lessee first reports royalties on a Form MMS-4014 using a valuationmethod authorized by paragraphs (c)(2) (iv) or (v) of this section, andeach time there is a change in a method under paragraphs (c)(2) (iv) or(v) of this section.(e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined value,the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between royaltypayments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty paymentsthat are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shallalso be liable for interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.202. If thelessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the takingof that credit.(f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that event,the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and may usethat method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS issuesits decision.

If take-or-paypayments are a part of gross proceeds, no additional royalty shall be dueif future make-up deliveries are taken, unless the purchaser is requiredto pay any additional amount because only a partial payment was previouslymade or as a result of price increases during the make-up period.(h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at nocost to the Federal Government or Indian lessor. Where the value establishedpursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, thatvalue shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has beenreduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certainservices, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lesseeto place the coal in marketable condition.(i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receivethrough legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contractrevision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely actionto receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it must pay royaltyat a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisionsor amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-lengthcontract, and may be retroactively applied to value for royalty purposesfor a period not to exceed two years, unless MMS approves a longer period.If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase allowed underits contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonablemeasures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lesseewill owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or considerationresulting from the price increase are received. This paragraph appliesto price increases only and shall not be construed to permit a lessee toavoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser failsto pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of coal.(j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary,no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that resultsin a redetermination by the MMS of value under this section shall be consideredfinal or binding as against the Federal Government, its beneficiaries,the Indian Tribes, or allottees until the audit period is formally closed.(k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation proposals,including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances pursuant toandSection; 206.265 of this chapter, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedomof Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 522.

Under no circumstances shall thewashing allowance and the transportation allowance authorized by andSection;206.262 of this subpart reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.(b) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a washingallowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall be liable forany additional royalties, plus interest determined in accordance with 30CFR 218.202, or shall be entitled to a credit without interest.(c) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate washing costs to Federalor Indian leases.(d) No cost normally associated with mining operations and which are necessaryfor placing coal in marketable condition shall be allowed as a cost ofwashing.(e) Coal washing costs shall only be recognized as allowances when thewashed coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.259</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determination of washing allowances.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Arm's-length contracts. </T3>(1) For washing costs incurred by a lesseepursuant to an arm's-length contract, the washing allowance shall be thereasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee for washing the coal underthat contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible futureadjustment. The MMS's prior approval is not required before a lessee maydeduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. However, before anydeduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed page one ofForm MMS-4292, Coal Washing Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph(c)(1) of this section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactivelyfor a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the monththat Form MMS-4292 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer periodupon a showing of good cause by the lessee.(2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the contractreflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directlyor indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the washing. If the contractreflects more than the total consideration paid, then the MMS may requirethat the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)of this section.(3) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-lengthwashing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the washing becauseof misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lesseeotherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the productionfor the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall requirethat the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)of this section.

All washing allowances deducted undera non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring,review, audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior MMS approval of washingallowances is not required for non-arm's-length or no contract situations.However, before any estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lesseemust submit a completed Form MMS-4292 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)of this section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactively for aperiod of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month thatForm MMS-4292 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upona showing of good cause by the lessee. The MMS will monitor the allowancededuction to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. Whennecessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its estimatedor actual washing allowance.(2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract situationshall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for washing during the reportingperiod, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and eitherdepreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordancewith paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initialdepreciable investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of returnin accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capitalcosts are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costsof delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integralpart of the wash plant.(i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering;operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes,rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operatingexpense which the lessee can document.(ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the wash plant;maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocableand attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.(iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenanceof the wash plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxesand severance taxes, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.(iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv) (A) or (B) of this section.After a lessee has elected to use either method for a wash plant, the lesseemay not later elect to change to the other alternative without approvalof the MMS.(A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-linedepreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of thereserves, whichever is appropriate, which the wash plant services, or aunit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may notchange methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a wash plantshall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original operator/lesseefor purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change inownership, a wash plant shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shallnot be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.(B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initialcapital investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return determinedpursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.

A Form MMS-4292received by the end of the month that the Form MMS-4014 is due shall beconsidered to be timely received. The initial reporting may be based onestimated costs.(ii) The initial Form MMS-4292 shall be effective for a reporting periodbeginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct a washingallowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or untilthe washing under the non-arm's-length contract or the no contract situationterminates, whichever is earlier.(iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial reportingperiod, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4292 containing theactual costs for the previous reporting period. If coal washing is continuing,the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4292 its estimated costs for the nextcalendar year. The estimated coal washing allowance shall be based on theactual costs for the previous period plus or minus any adjustments whichare based on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases which willaffect the allowance. Form MMS-4292 must be received by MMS within 3 monthsafter the end of the previous reporting period, unless MMS approves a longerperiod (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowancefrom the previous reporting period). (iv) For new wash plants, the lessee's initial Form MMS-4292 shall includeestimates of the allowable coal washing costs for the applicable period.Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available operationsdata for the plant, or if such data are not available, the lessee shalluse estimates based upon industry data for similar coal wash plants. (v) Washing allowances based on non-arm's-length or no-contract situationswhich are in effect at the time these regulations become effective willbe allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposesof this section, only those allowances that have been approved by MMS inwriting shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulationsbecome effective.

(vii) The MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirementswhich are different from the requirements of this section. (3) The MMS may establish coal washing allowance reporting dates for individualleases different from those specified in this subpart in order to providemore effective administration. Lessees will be notified of any change intheir reporting period. (4) Washing allowances must be reported as a separate line on the FormMMS-4014, unless MMS approves a different reporting procedure.

(c) (1) When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible fora transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the lesseeis not required to allocate transportation costs between the quantity ofclean coal output and the rejected waste material. The transportation allowanceshall be authorized for the total production which is transported. Transportationallowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.(2) For coal that is not washed at a wash plant, the transportation allowanceshall be authorized for the total production which is transported. Transportationallowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal transported.

(1) For transportation costs incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-lengthcontract, the transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actualcosts incurred by the lessee for transporting the coal under that contract,subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. TheMMS's prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurredunder an arm's-length contract. However, before any deduction may be taken,the lessee must submit a completed page one of Form MMS-4293, Coal TransportationAllowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c) (1) of this section.A transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period ofnot more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form MMS-4293is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a showing ofgood cause by the lessee.

(b) <T3>Non-arm's-length or no contract. </T3>(1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-lengthcontract or has no contract, including those situations where the lesseeperforms transportation services for itself, the transportation allowancewill be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All transportationallowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no-contract situation aresubject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. PriorMMS approval of transportation allowances is not required for non-arm's-lengthor no-contract situations. However, before any estimated or actual deductionmay be taken, the lessee must submit a completed Form MMS-4293 in accordancewith paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A transportation allowance may beclaimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to thefirst day of the month that Form MMS-4293 is filed with MMS, unless MMSapproves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. TheMMS will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure that deductions arereasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may directa lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.(2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract situationsshall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for transportation duringthe reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead,and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investmentin accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equalto the initial depreciable investment in the transportation system multipliedby the rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of thissection. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixedassets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment)which are an integral part of the transportation system. (i) Allowable operating expenses include: operations supervision and engineering;operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes;rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operatingexpense which the lessee can document.

(A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-linedepreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of thereserves, whichever, is appropriate, which the transportation system services,or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee maynot change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a transportationsystem shall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the originaltransporter/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or withouta change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated onlyonce. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.(B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initialcapital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rateof return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(B)(v) of this section.No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shallapply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or acquiredafter [<T3>insert the effective date of these regulations</T3>]. (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with Standardand Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly averageas published in <T3>Standard and Poor's Bond Guide </T3>for the first month of the reportingperiod for which the allowance is applicable and shall be effective duringthe reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined at the beginning ofeach subsequent transportation allowance reporting period (which is determinedpursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section). (3) A lessee may apply to the MMS for an exception from the requirementthat it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)of this section. The MMS will grant the exception only if the lessee hasa rate for the transportation aproved by a Federal agency (for both Federaland Indian leases) or by a State regulatory agency (for Federal leases).The MMS shall deny the exception request if it determines that the rateis excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by systems,owned by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation servicesin that area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, MMSshall deny the exception request if: (i) no Federal or State regulatoryagency cost analysis exists and the Federal or State regulatory agency,as applicable, has declined to investigate pursuant to MMS timely objectionsupon filing; and (ii) the rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actualcosts for transportation as determined under this section.
