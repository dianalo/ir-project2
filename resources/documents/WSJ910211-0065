Nomani   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/11/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   LABOR AMR</CO><IN>AIRLINES (AIR)</IN><LP>   American Airlines and its pilots union agreed to atentative labor contract that averts a costly strike at theindustry giant.   The tentative contract brings to a near-close 16 months oftense negotiations between American, a unit of AMR Corp. ofFort Worth, Texas, and the Allied Pilots Association, whichrepresents 8,800 pilots at the airline. The contract wasagreed upon Saturday morning after an all-night session inWashington.</LP><TEXT>   The resolution is important for American, which is in astiff battle with UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit to seizethe mantle as the country's largest airline. American alreadygrounded 11% of its flights this year, blaming operationalproblems on its pilots. The cuts included the competitive LosAngeles-San Francisco route.   Further labor troubles could have forced American to loseimportant ground to Chicago-based United, which hasn't madeas substantial cuts to its flying schedule.   American and the union are expected this week to negotiatea final contract. The union said that it expects to releaseterms of the contract today. The contract requiresratification from the union's board, which is expected tomeet this weekend.   Tom Hunt, a captain at American and a union spokesman,said the two sides agreed to enter into binding arbitrationon several points, including medical health care benefits foractive members and retirees. Still, Mr. Hunt said, theunion's strike-preparedness committee is &quot;going to go on theshelf now.&quot;   In a joint statement, union president Fred Vogel and RalphCraviso, American's vice president of employee relations,said &quot;a long and difficult period of negotiations had beensuccessfully concluded with a mutually beneficial newcontract.&quot;   The National Mediation Board, which oversees airline laborrelations, pushed for the negotiated settlement by bringingthe two sides together last week in talks supervised by HarryBickford, a federal mediator.   Before the two sides started last week's talks, they wereconsidered several hundred million dollars apart. The unionhad rejected an American offer mostly because of American'sproposed pay levels, medical benefits and work rule changes.   The main issue hampering the talks was American'scontroversial two-tier wage system for pilots. The union hasclaimed the system puts most of American's cockpit crews nearthe bottom of the industry pay scale. It isn't yet clear howthat was resolved.   The union's previous contract expired at the end of 1989.Pilots at American have been working under that contractbecause, under airline labor law, the old contract stays ineffect until a new contract is negotiated, or until federalmediators decide the two sides have reached an impasse.   Then, the mediation board sets a 30-day countdown clock,after which the company can impose its own contract and theunion can strike. The tentative contract avoids thedeclaration of an impasse.   At one point in the negotiations, in January, Americanbecame the butt of jokes when it misidentified its pilots'union in full-page newspaper advertisements blaming the unionfor disrupting the airline's operations and apologizing tocustomers for the delays. American referred incorrectly toits union as the &quot;Airline Pilots Association.&quot; The Air LinePilots Association is another union group that representspilots at other major airlines.</TEXT></DOC>
