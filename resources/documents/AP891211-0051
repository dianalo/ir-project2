Israel has said it will refuse to negotiate with anyoneconnected with Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, whichthe Israelis consider a terrorist group.   The PLO has criticized the U.S.-backed plan for a dialogue inCairo that could lead to elections in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip.   Asked about Israel's refusal to negotiate with the PLO, Arafatsaid, ``With whom they are going to make peace? With ghosts?''   Arafat was speaking by satellite from Baghdad, Iraq, on NBC-TV's``Meet the Press,'' which was taped Saturday and aired Sunday.   Asked if he could assure Israel that a Palestinian state wouldpose no threat to the Jewish state, Arafat replied, ``We want tolive in peace with all our neighbors, including the Israelis.''   ``We are looking for a brave man, a brave leader among theIsraeli leadership, to accept, to start the peace processes, toimplement real peace in the land of peace,'' he said.   He acknowledged that if a Palestinian state were created, itwould seek to confederate with Jordan.   ``The Palestinians and their leadership have the right todesignate their representatives, as well as the Israeli governmentwill designate their delegation,'' he said.   ``If they want the PLO to participate in this negotiation,definitely, we have the right,'' the PLO chairman said.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in May proposed thatelections be held in the occupied territories to allow Palestiniansto choose their own representatives under a plan for limitedself-rule. Shamir ruled out Israeli withdrawal or recognition of aPalestinian state.   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed a 10-pointmodification of Shamir's plan under which Israel would accept theidea of trading land for peace. He later called for hold directIsraeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III then formulated hisown five-point plan to advance the negotiations, which both Israeland Egypt agreed to with reservations.</TEXT></DOC>
