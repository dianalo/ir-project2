If so, for four years now, practically everyone would have been wrong. Since late 1982, while corporate profit growth has been sputtering, stock prices have been burning up the track.    In mid-August 1982, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered around 780. It closed Friday at 1914.23, within 5 1/2 points of its record of 1919.71, set Sept. 4. And its latest surge has come in the face of a widening insider-trading scandal that has rocked Wall Street.    What has been driving stock prices ever higher when profit growth has been meager at best for many companies? Lower interest rates, declining inflation and a surge in corporate cash flow, analysts and market strategists say.    They say that when interest rates and inflation are low, alternatives to stocks, such as real estate and artworks, aren't so attractive to investors. Corporate earnings may come in below expectations, yet stock prices rise because &quot;investors are willing to pay a higher valuation on what earnings do exist,&quot; says Michael Aronstein, a portfolio strategist with Comstock Partners, a money management firm in New York.    But now some analysts warn that cyclical changes and the overhaul of the tax law may have removed some vital parts from the stock market's engine.    The market impact of declining interest rates and low inflation is seen in expanding price/earnings ratios. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing a stock's current price by the company's annual per-share earnings. Many analysts use trailing 12-month earnings or a forecast of the current year's profit to calculate the P/E.    The P/E ratio for the companies in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index has a little more than doubled in four years, to about 17 times trailing earnings in the second quarter of this year from about eight times in the 1982 third quarter. During the same time, the Sandamp;P 500 index rose about 140%.    Elaine Garzarelli, a market strategist with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, expects the earnings multiple on the Sandamp;P 500 to fall to about 15 by the end of 1988. Although interest rates may remain stable or fall slightly in the next two years, she believes corporate cash flow will be severely diminished by the new tax law. And because it allows such a clear view of a company's profitability, &quot;cash flow is what moves the P/E up or down,&quot; she says.    Some analysts expect the first shock to the market to come early next year, when companies begin to report 1986 fourth-quarter results.    The new tax code eliminates the corporate investment tax credit retroactive to last January. But rather than restate earnings to show the loss of the credit, accounting standards dictate that corporations make the adjustment in the fourth quarter, when the tax bill was signed into law.    Ms. Garzarelli says after-tax earnings will be depressed because of this. She expects the Sandamp;P 500 companies' earnings to fall 5% to 10%.    The new tax code further reduces cash flow because it eliminates the rapid depreciation allowances that have been in effect since 1981.    Charles I. Clough, director of investment policy at Cowen andamp; Co. in Boston, says this year's tax changes came when cash flow was already slowing. Cash flow won't get much help from the revenue side either, he says, as an investment and consumer spending boom that began in 1983 peaked early this year.    By forcing corporations to depreciate their assets more slowly while cutting the maximum corporate tax rate to 34% from 46%, the new tax law could actually increase reported earnings for some companies. But the increases could be misleading, so analysts are urging investors to watch cash flow more closely than reported earnings.    If the stock market has gone as far as it can in expanding P/E multiples, then the earnings themselves will be the key for 1987, says Robert Salomon, director of equity research at Salomon Brothers in New York. He says the massive restructurings of the past few years have given many companies new operational efficiency that could work magic on profit margins in the year ahead.    Current earnings expectations for next year are too low, Mr. Salomon contends, because analysts haven't taken into account this operational leverage.    Ms. Garzarelli at Shearson Lehman is looking for higher reported earnings next year from a reduction in write-offs, tighter cost controls and a turnaround in the U.S. trade balance to the benefit of some manufacturing companies.    Lucinda Mezey, director of equity research at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia, is forecasting a modest pickup in economic growth next year, which suggests slightly higher interest rates and inflation in the near term. This means price/earnings ratios would shrink, she says, so the market will need increased earnings to maintain its current level.    But she warns that investors would be &quot;imprudent&quot; to look for a rapid economic expansion this late in the business cycle. &quot;And they wouldn't be right in looking for companies that need operating leverage or price increases to grow earnings,&quot; she says.    She says a company that can increase earnings 12% to 15% annually should be quite acceptable; the real question is whether results turn out to be above or below expectations. &quot;The reality is that we're in a slow-growth environment,&quot; she says. &quot;It's a different world than most of us grew up in.&quot;    Mr. Aronstein at Comstock Partners says companies whose earnings can quickly reflect any pickup in economic growth should see their stock prices outperform the rest of the market next year. He puts paper and forest-product concerns and nonferrous metal, chemical and some technology issues in this group. &quot;These are pretty much the stocks you didn't want to own until last summer,&quot; he says.    Because consumers' eating and drinking habits don't readily change with changes in the rate of economic expansion, companies whose earnings growth is &quot;based on the elasticity of the American consumer's stomach&quot; could see their stocks underperform the market in an era of growth. Many consumer-oriented companies, such as food and beverage concerns, fall into this category.    Edward Kerschner, chairman of the investment policy committee at PaineWebber, says he wouldn't suggest that investors move completely out of any sector right now. &quot;This will continue to be an eclectic market,&quot; he says.    When picking a stock, Mr. Kerschner and other analysts suggest that investors pay close attention to the company's fundamentals, analysts' expectations for it, the market's valuation of its industry and the company's balance-sheet strength.    &quot;There's a lot of divergence within groups, and that suggests that you have to be careful,&quot; Ms. Mezey says.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Traders hoping for a record on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were disappointed Friday, when the average dropped 2.53 points to close at 1914.23 in listless post-holiday trading.
