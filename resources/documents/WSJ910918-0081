More and moreof it is government-held.   This may serve to benefit the economy in the very nearterm. It makes less of the overall debt burden subject todefault by overextended private borrowers who, unlike theirgovernmental counterparts, can't print money or raise taxesto pay bills. It also allows more governmental spending,which can help bolster an economy as weak as today's.</LP><TEXT>   In the longer run, however, the shift from private togovernmental debt will put upward pressure on interest rates,says Edward S. Hyman, president of ISI Group Inc., a New Yorkinvestment adviser. Private borrowers, he warns, will be&quot;crowded out&quot; by government in credit markets, leading toeconomic weakness. President Bush, he adds, &quot;has done a poorjob in dealing with this issue and Congress is beyond respectand hope.&quot;   For years, new borrowing by consumers and privatebusinesses far exceeded the rise of governmental debt. Forinstance, private debt rose $119 billion more thangovernmental debt in 1990 and $345 billion more in 1989. Butin the 12 months through July, governmental debt rose $297billion, or $79 billion more than the corresponding increasein private borrowing. As a result, the governmental share ofthe debt load is near 36%, up from 30% a decade ago.   In the same period, all debt outstanding -- governmental,business and individual -- has swelled to nearly $11 trillionfrom less than $4 trillion. Today's total -- close to $43,000for each man, woman and child in the U.S. -- exceeds 1.9times the gross national product, up from 1.7 in themid-1980s. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, debt ranged onlyfrom 1.2 to 1.4 times GNP. Just since 1989, the debt load hasmounted nearly $2 trillion.   Analysts expect the recent trend to continue. Mr. Hymanreckons that in the next year overall debt will expand by$583 billion, or nearly $60 billion more than in the pastyear. He further estimates that governmental debt willaccount for $400 billion of the increase, or almost 70%. Bycomparison, the governmental share was only 25% in 1989 and40% in 1990.   Spurring the trend is a federal budget deficit expected bythe Congressional Budget Office to reach $362 billion infiscal year 1992, which ends Sept. 30, up from an estimated$279 billion in fiscal 1991 and from $220 billion in fiscal1990. Expecting slower economic growth in the year ahead thanthe CBO's estimate of 3.3%, Mr. Hyman predicts that the 1992deficit &quot;is more likely to be $380 billion.&quot;   With the prospect of such red ink, he finds it&quot;outrageous&quot; that federal outlays -- even excluding defenseand the savings-and-loan bailout -- &quot;have increased 9.6% overthe past 12 months.&quot; With a presidential election next year,he suggests that this spending rise very possibly willaccelerate, since such speedups are the rule in presidentialelection years.   The federal budget &quot;is out of control,&quot; says Charles B.Reeder, an economic consultant in Wilmington, Del., who isn'tgiven to hyperbole. The deficits &quot;will be a drag on theeconomy,&quot; he predicts, since &quot;they preclude the possibilityof either tax cuts to stimulate demand or new spendingprograms to deal with serious social and economic problems.&quot;   H. Erich Heinemann, economist of Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp;Co., worries especially about the deficit's impact on savingand investment. &quot;The more Washington borrows, the lowernational saving will be,&quot; he warns. &quot;Low saving equals lowinvestment. In turn, low investment will lead to slow growthand a decline in the U.S. standard of living relative toother nations, particularly Japan and Germany.&quot;   The link between saving and investment involves whateconomists call net national saving. This is simply the sumof business and personal saving, minus the federal budgetdeficit. What remains is money available for private-sectorinvestment. In the 1970s, net national saving averaged over7% of GNP, but recently it has fallen below 3%. A recentCommerce Department survey finds, by no coincidence, thatbusinesses plan to raise their capital spending this year byonly 0.5%.   Stepped-up borrowing by state and local authorities alsois fueling the surge in governmental debt. As recently as1984, state and local governments, taken as a whole, sportedan operating-budget surplus of about $20 billion. Last year,in sorry contrast, they sustained a record operating deficitof $34 billion, and many forecasters anticipate still deeperstate and local deficits in the year ahead.   To help make up the shortfall, 20 to 30 states plan&quot;major&quot; tax increases in the year ahead, according to theNational Center for Policy Analysis. This would tend toworsen the federal deficit, since state and local taxes arelargely deductible from federal taxes. The upshot will be&quot;leaner and meaner -- not gentler and kinder -- times,&quot;forecasts Laurence B. Rossbach Jr., an analyst at SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;It will slow down the recovery.&quot;   Mr. Reeder notes that &quot;so far this year 33 states haveraised more than $17 billion in new taxes,&quot; and he reckonsthat &quot;these higher taxes will be an additional depressant onconsumer spending in 1992.&quot; The &quot;fiscal drag&quot; from state andlocal tax boosts and spending cuts will be &quot;around $50billion, with tax increases accounting for more than half thetotal,&quot; he says.   Also hastening the trend toward greater governmentaldebt-holding is the slowing pace of borrowing within theeconomy's private sector.   A study by analysts at BCA Publications Inc., aninvestment service, finds that &quot;the annual growth in privatenonfinancial debt has tumbled from 13% to 3 1/2% during thepast five years.&quot; Credit demand, the report further states,hasn't &quot;responded to an aggressive easing in monetarypolicy.&quot; Home-mortgage debt will rise only 6.9% a year in thethree years through 1993, BCA predicts, while other mortgagedebt will increase only 1.3%. In 1985-90, by comparison,home-mortgage debt climbed nearly 12% annually and othermortgage debt 7.3%.   The savings-and-loan bailout also is spurring the shift indebt. Maury N. Harris, economist of PaineWebber Inc., notesthat buyers of failed thrift institutions typically receivepayments from the Resolution Trust Corp. that approximate theoriginal value of assets gone bad. The Sandamp;L bailout agencytypically borrows to finance such payments, he adds, and theupshot is a rise in federal debt, while private debt ispared.   Consumer credit outstanding is actually dropping. It fellat an annual rate of 1.4% in July, a contraction of $838million. This was on the heels of a 2.8% drop in June. Such apersistent decline, many analysts say, reflects more thansimply the latest recession; it is a consequence of toughertax rules on interest deductions and, more importantly, ofthe strapped cirucumstances of many households after a decadeof excessive borrowing.   Consumer and corporate balance sheets are &quot;badly in needof repair, as indicated by the record number of bankruptciesand mortgage delinquencies,&quot; says Lacy H. Hunt, chiefeconomist in New York of Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp.With the resulting &quot;dismal state of loan demand,&quot; he adds,banks are buying increasing amounts of government securities,instead of making loans; this, in turn, allows the recordbudget deficit &quot;to be funded in an environment of fallinginterest rates.&quot;   Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.,cautions that once a business recovery is solidly inprogress, however, &quot;private credit demand will rise rapidly,&quot;while the budget outlook &quot;implies no letup in Treasuryborrowing.&quot; This points to an increasingly serious &quot;crowdingout&quot; of private borrowers by governmental ones, he says.Among other unpleasant consequences, he adds, is that bondyields could rise considerably.   In the past, when the economy has moved from a recessioninto a recovery phase of the business cycle, any federalbudget deficit has tended to narrow, reflecting reducedfederal unemployment payments and rising federal revenues asearnings revive. This underlies widespread forecasts ofsharply reduced deficits later this decade. The CongressionalBudget Office, for example, expects the red ink to ease to$278 billion in fiscal 1993 and to $234 billion in fiscal1994, assuming a sustained upswing in business activity.   No one knows, of course, whether such will be thesituation. In the past, forecasts of diminishing deficitsoften proved overly optimistic. Moreover, a sustainedeconomic expansion is by no means assured, especially inlight of the enormous debt load. A solid recovery wouldsurely stem the surge in governmental debt, but the surge maypreclude a solid recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
