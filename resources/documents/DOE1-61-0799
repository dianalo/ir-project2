Kensington Homes of Winnipegadapted a conventional 87 square meter house design to double wall constructionwith increased insulation in walls and ceiling areas. Other energy savingfeatures incorporated were continuous vapour barrier, increased basementinsulation, triple glazing maximized on south exposure, and an air toair heat exchanger for ventilation. The house is heated by four electricbaseboard heaters with a maximum total rating of 3.8 kW. House constructionwas monitored and air leakage testing performed. The final measured airleakage rate was 0.28 air changes per hour at 10 Pascals pressure differentialfor the complete home which compared very favourably with other energyefficient houses. The importance of monitoring, and careful attentionto vapour barrier sealing and weatherstripping was demonstrated duringthe construction. Achievement of adequate sealing could be a problemin high volume construction. Based on heat load analysis, a simple paybackperiod of approximately 15 years was calculated for the cost of energyconserving features, assuming current electrical rates. 8 figs., 2 tabs.,8 illus.</TEXT></DOC>
