Oil traders reacted skeptically to the statement and oil priceswere little changed. The September contract for West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 9 centsto $15.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Subroto, who is touring Latin American oil producers, said hewill go to Iran and Iraq following the scheduled Aug. 20 cease-fireto try to convince the former enemies to accept equal productionquotas as they end their eight-year war.   He said said the organization could opt for a new lowerbenchmark price ``of, say, $17'' in its November regular meeting asan alternative to cutting production.   He added that the organization's price committee would meetsometime after the last week in August but before the Nov. 21 OPECministerial conference.   ``The outcome of the cease-fire is anyone's guess, but myopinion is that (Iran and Iraq) will be rational and what they willrationally want is higher prices to build their economies,''Subroto told a press conference.   ``By bringing Iraq's production to equal that of Iran, this willreduce OPEC production without reducing the temporary quota ofanyone (else). ... With that policy, we will be able to strengthenprices without a lower production level,'' he said.   ``I will try my best to convince Iran to accept parity,'' saidSubroto, who is the Indonesian oil minister. Iran's quota is2,369,000 barrels per day.   He said a parity agreement would ``at least'' reduce Iraq'sproduction by 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day, while an end tooil loans to Iraq by its allies Saudi Arabia and Kuwait couldresult in a total cutback of 1 million barrels.   He said he would visit both nations in the last week of Augustand would report the results of his talks to the OPEC pricecommittee, which would then meet prior to the organization'sNovember regular conference.   He said OPEC might decide in November for ``a higher productionlevel but at a lower price of, say, $17'' per barrel.   ``What strategy we take depends on the (regular) conference,''he said. OPEC's current target price is $18 per barrel, althoughactual market prices are $14 to $15 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
