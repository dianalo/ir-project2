Foreign minister Pik Botha told the media that SouthAfrica had the capability to make nuclear weapons if so wished. ShouldSouth Africa accede to the Non-proliferation treaty (NPT), it would becomeobliged to open to the inspectorate of the IAEA its uranium enrichmentplant at Valindaba, as well as make the obvious commitment not to manufacturenuclear weapons. It is difficult to believe that South Africa would readilybe prepared to sign away its ability to create a stockpile of nuclearweapons for the sort of gain achievable through membership of the NPT.It will not be discovered how much South Africa is really prepared togive away, at least until after the American presidential election inNovember 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
