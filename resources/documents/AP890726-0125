ADDS byline.</HEAD><BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>RABAT, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The foreign ministers of Belgium and Zairesigned an agreement Wednesday to normalize relations and forget abitter 18-month dispute over the Central African nation's debt toits former colonizer.   As part of the agreement, Belgium canceled about $285 million indebts owed by Zaire, delegation sources said.   It also agreed to a 14-year period during which interestpayments on $370 million in outstanding Zairean commercial debtswill be made to a fund for development projects in Zaire.   The agreement was reached late Tuesday between Prime MinisterWilfried Martens of Belgium and President Mobutu Sese Seko ofZaire, who attended the signing ceremony at the royal palace.   They applauded as Zairean Foreign Minister Nguza Karl-I-Bond andhis Belgian counterpart, Mark Eyskens, signed the accord.   The signing ceremony originally was scheduled for Tuesday butwas postponed following last-minute difficulties over details ofthe accord.   Officials said the main obstacle was Belgian insistence onmentioning the International Monetary Fund as the umbrellaorganization for carrying out the agreement.   The Zaire delegation refused to accept reference to the fund ongrounds the agreement ``was strictly a bilateral matter betweenZaire and Belgium,'' delegation sources reported.   The two delegations met Tuesday night at a dinner put on byMorocco's King Hassan II, who helped resolve the dispute.   A communique issued after the signing ceremony said the twogovernments had ``put an end to the crisis in their relations ...and removed all obstacles to their continued good relations on thebasis of legality.''   The communique said both governments expressed their gratitudeto the king for his ``invaluable aid.''   Belgium and Zaire, which used to be the Belgian Congo, have beenat odds since December 1987, when Mobutu rejected Brussels' offersto ease the debt burden and denounced the treaty of friendshipbetween the two countries.</TEXT></DOC>
