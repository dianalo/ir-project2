The systems notice for thissystem was most recently published at 49 FR 49943 (1984). Data in thissystem are used primarily for statistical and research purposes relatedto evaluating the operation and effectiveness of the Medicare program.A principal subfile in the system is the Medicare Provider Analysis andReview (MEDPAR) file. The MEDPAR file contains data from hospital billsof Medicare beneficiaries discharged from Medicare certified hospitals,including data on beneficiary demographics, medical diagnosis and surgery,and utilization of hospital resources. We are proposing to establish anew routine use to permit HCFA to disclose on an annual basis much of theinformation in the MEDPAR file for research into the quality and effectivenessof health care furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.The Medicare program has an important stake in the development of improvedmethodologies for measuring and comparing health care quality and effectiveness.The introduction of prospectively determined hospital payments, plus theincreased numbers of alternative delivery systems such as health maintenanceorganizations and preferred provider organizations, have raised the interestof many in the monitoring and assurance of the quality of health care providedunder these revised financial incentives. Progress in the assessment ofquality and effectiveness, however, has been impeded in part by the lackof data bases describing the care given to patients.HCFA convened a symposium in June 1987 to identify research needs relatingto the measurement and monitoring of quality and effectiveness of care.Strong support was expressed at the symposium for analysis and monitoringat several levels including: (1) Epidemiologic monitoring of patient outcomessuch as mortality, morbidity, and disability; (2) local area analyses toidentify problems in both patient outcomes and health care processes; and(3) analysis and monitoring of both outcomes and processes of care at theinstitution or medical care plan level.In response to the needs highlighted at the symposium, HCFA has developedthe Quality of Care MEDPAR file (QC/MEDPAR) to increase the amount of dataavailable for quality and effectiveness of care research. Our purpose isto assist researchers in developing and applying improved measures fordetermining the quality and effectiveness of care furnished in hospitalsparticipating in the Medicare program. The development and release of theQC/MEDPAR file is in keeping with HCFA's commitment to the improvementof the qulaity of health care practiced in the United States and, foremost,that given to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. This purpose is alsocompatible with a purpose for which the data in the Medicare Bill Fileare collected, namely, to promote study of the operation and effectivenessof the Medicare program. We would note that similar use of Medicare datais made for patient outcome assessment research authorized under section1875(c) of the Social Security Act, as enacted in 1986 by section 9316of Pub. L. 99-509.We are proposing to include in the QC/MEDPAR file the data elements listedin Appendix A of the system notice. Research on the quality and the effectivenessof care provided in the hospital inpatient setting requires detailed informationon a patient-specific basis. Accurate assessment of the outcomes of care(such as mortality, morbidity, and disability) requires that it be possibleto track individual patients over time. Therefore, linkage of multipe episodesof care is necessary in order to evaluate an entire episode of care, orthe entire course of a disease or the treatment of disease. This is especiallytrue for chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes,where the course of the disease may run over months or years. In orderto meet this need, the QC/MEDPAR file will include encrypted health insuranceclaim numbers with the same encrypted number used for all records pertainingto a particular individual. These encrypted numbers will enable an individual'sentire history of inpatient care to be linked and studied as a single entity,while concealing that individual's identity.Similarly, it is necessary to include geographical information in the fileto enable small area variations analyses. Many studies have documentedwide variations across geographic areas in hospitalization rates and useof surgical procedures that cannot be accounted for by the health statusof the resident population. Assessment of the reasons for these variationsrequires that the records contain a geographic variable. County codes areinsufficient for this purpose because medical service areas (those areasfrom which individual hospitals get their patients) cross county boundariesand there may be multiple service areas within single counties. The inclusionof ZIP Codes will enable researchers to develop service area analyses whichcan more closely approximate the real medical service areas at the locallevel.In order to protect the privacy of Medicare beneficiaries, we have wherepossible removed, coded, or encrypted data elements in the QC/MEDPAR fileto reduce the likelihood that specific individuals will be identified withinformation in the file. The file does not contain beneficiary name orrace; each beneficiary's health insurance claim number has been encrypted;the exact age of beneficiaries is obscured by use of age intervals; andall dates have been modified by adding or subtracting 1 to 20 days fromthe actual dates. The file will be national in scope; no subsets of thefile will be provided.As a further precaution, we are requiring recipients of the data file toagree in writing not to link the data to any other beneficiary-specificrecords to use the data to identify individuals. We will release the dataonly upon receipt and approval of a research plan specifying the objectivesof the research, the manner in which the data will be used, the financialsupport for the plan, and the date the research will be completed. Recipientswill also be required to agree not to use the data for purposes other thanquality and effectiveness of care research. The file may not be used forpurposes such as marketing (e.g., identification and targeting of under-or over-served health service markets primarily for the purposes of commercialbenefit), insurance (e.g., targeting marketing areas, or redlining areasdeemed to offer bad health insurance risks), or adverse selection (e.g.,identifying patients with high-risk diagnoses). In addition, recipientswill have to establish appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentialityof the data and prevent unauthorized access to it.We are proposing that the following routine use for release of the QC/MEDPARfile be added to the current system notice for system number 09-70-0005.(7) With respect to the QC/MEDPAR file, to entities with a legitimate needfor data for the purpose of conducting research on the quality and effectivenessof care provided in hospitals. Research using data released under thisroutine use must focus on the improvement of measures for determining,validating, and monitoring the quality and effectiveness of hospital carein such areas as access to care, outcomes of care, and effectiveness ofcare in improving, restoring, or maintaining the independence and functioningof Medicare beneficiaries. Information disclosed under this routine usewill be limited to the data elements described in Appendix A.The QC/MEDPAR file may be released to an entity if HCFA determines:a. That the use or disclosure does not violate legal limitations underwhich the data were provided, collected, or obtained.b. That the purpose for which the disclosure is to be made:(1) Cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the data are provided in thedetailed form described in Appendix A;(2) Is reasonably likely to be accomplished in view of the capabilitiesof the requesting entity and other factors; and(3) Is of sufficient importance to warrant the possible effect on the privacyof the individual that the disclosure of the data might bring.c. The entity must submit and HCFA must approve:(1) A research plan specifying the objectives of the research, the mannerin which the data will be used, the financial support for the plan, andthe date the research will be completed; and(2) A copy of any report by a panel of recognized experts reviewing theresearch plan (where such review has been performed).d. The entity and its contractors, if any, must sign a statement acknowledgingthat section 1106(a) of the Social Security Act, which prohibits the disclosureof confidential information and imposes criminal penalties, may apply.They must also agree to the following:(1) Not to link the data to other beneficiary-specific records to use thedata to identify individual beneficiaries;(2) Not to use the data for purposes that are not related to research onthe quality and effectiveness of hospital inpatient care, including butnot limited to: marketing (identification and targeting of under- or over-servedhealth service markets primarily for the purposes of commercial benefit),insurance (redlining areas deemed to offer bad health insurance risks),and adverse selection (identifying patients with high-risk diagnoses);(3) Not to disclose the data to any persons unless the data are in aggregatedform as described in paragraph 5. The data may be disclosed to a contractorfor data processing if:(a) The entity has specified in the research plan submitted to HCFA thatthe contractor would receive the data for that purpose, or the entity hasobtained written authorization from HCFA to make the disclosure to thecontractor, and(b) The contractor has signed a confidentiality statement with HCFA;(4) Not to publish or otherwise disclose the data in a form raising unacceptablepossibilities that beneficiaries could be identified (i.e., the data mustnot be beneficiary-specific and must be aggregated to a level where nodata cells have ten or fewer beneficiaries);(5) To submit a copy of any aggregation of the data intended for publicationto HCFA for approval prior to publication;(6) To establish appropriate administrative, technical, procedural andphysical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the data and to preventunauthorized access to it;(7) To return all files to HCFA, and destroy any copies that may have beenmade, at the completion of the research plan.The new routine use is consistent with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7),since, as previously noted, it is compatible with the purpose for whichthe information is collected. Because the addition of this new routineuse will not change the purposes for which the information is to be usedor otherwise significantly alter the system, we are not preparing a reportof altered system of records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(o). The entire systemsnotice is published below.
