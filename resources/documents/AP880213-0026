(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The presidential campaigns began turningbitter on the final weekend before the New Hampshire primary, withJack Kemp denouncing a Pat Robertson commercial as a lie andRichard Gephardt saying a Paul Simon ad questions his integrity.   The public schedules of the campaigns were snarled by a massivesnow storm Friday, but the reality that the first 1988 primary willend some candidates' hopes heated up the rhetoric.   For one Republican _ Alexander Haig _ the campaign ended Friday,as he withdrew in the face of certain defeat.   For one longshot Democrat _ Bruce Babbitt _ Friday was the timeto ask voters to prolong a campaign offering vastly different ideasfrom those of his rivals.   ``Let me be direct, even blunt _ New Hampshire has the power oflife or death over my campaign,'' Babbitt told a state partydinner. ``I don't expect to win the New Hampshire primary, but whatI do need to do, what you need to do, is to send a message to therest of America that here, in the snowy hills of New England, amessage of courage and challenge and hope was kept alive.''   In the final 72 hours before the primary vote begins, theairwaves in New Hamsphire are filled with campaign commercials, andthose ads started sharp exchanges.   Kemp, his chance for at least a moral victory here threatened byRobertson's surge, demanded that the former television evangelistwithdraw television commercials and printed fliers that contained``deliberate distortions.''   ``I can't insist that all candidates abide by Ronald Reagan's11th commandment'' not to speak ill of another Republican, Kempsaid in an address to the Conservative Political Action Committeein Washington.   ``But all of us should abide by the Ninth Commandment: Thoushalt not bear false witness,'' he said to prolonged cheers.   Robertson, snowbound in Merrimack, N.H., said: ``This is thekind of desperate thing that losers begin to do. ... We didn't putout any of this stuff he's talking about.''   Four of the Democratic candidates _ Simon, Gephardt, Babbitt andMassachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis _ showed up for a New Hampshirestate party fund-raising dinner. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennesseeand Jesse Jackson had planned to be back in the state, but couldnot make it due to the snow. Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart did notplan to attend the dinner.   But the fraternal nature of the evening did not stop thebickering.   Turning to Simon and Gephardt, Dukakis asked: ``You guys gettingalong? Anything I can do to help?''   The audience of activists laughed as many understood thebickering between the No. 2 and No. 3 contenders has done nothingto hurt Dukakis.   After the dinner, the trading of barbs between Simon andGephardt blew up.   ``Enough is enough on these negative ads,'' Gephardt toldreporters. ``Paul Simon is running an ad that ought to come off thetelevision. It impugns my character and my integrity by saying, canyou trust this man?   ``So to put it very straight _ enough is enough. I asked Sen.Simon to take those ads off television. And if he doesn't, he oughtto take off the bow tie because he's just another politician aslong as they're on,'' the Missouri congressman said.   Only moments before, Simon had told reporters that drawing outthe distinctions between the candidates is legitimate.   ``As long as it doesn't get too acrimonious, I think that ahealthy comparison is good,'' Simon said.   Gephardt promised to renew the exchange at the final debatebefore the primary, a confrontation sponsored by the League ofWomen Voters this afternoon at St. Anselm College.   The daily polling of the sentiments of the New Hampshire voterscontinued without pause, with Vice President George Bush locked ina neck-and-neck race with Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.   One survey, the ABC News-Washington Post poll taken Thursdaynight, showed Bush with 32 percent to Dole's 26 percent. Another,the CBS News poll taken Wednesday and Thursday, gave the Kansassenator 32 percent to Bush's 29 percent.   The CBS poll was based on interviews with 499 likely GOP primaryvoters and had a sampling error margin of 4 percentage points. TheABC-Washington Post poll interviewed 559 likely Republican votersand had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.   In both polls, Dukakis maintained a strong lead in theDemocratic race.</TEXT></DOC>
