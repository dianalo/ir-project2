From the field dependence of magnetizationanisotropy constants and correlation radii of anisotropy axis fluctuationin the initial state, after two-hour annealing at 350 deg C and heattreatments of the alloys by short (0.1 s) alternating current pulsesof increasing amplitude have been calculated. It is shown that magneticcrystallographic anisotropy fluctuating in space makes a considerablecontribution to anisotropy to amorphous alloys.</TEXT></DOC>
