The commission is expected to sign a final order in the next few days. With that approval, construction on the first of four 150-megawatt, lignite coal-fired units of the plant is expected to begin in September.    The Fort Worth, Texas-based utility had faced opposition from the Houston Light andamp; Power Co. unit of Houston Industries Inc. and from cogenerating concerns that claimed they could sell the energy cheaper than TNP could build a facility to produce it. TNP currently purchases from other utilities almost all of the power it sells to its customers. </TEXT></DOC>
