Last year's quarter included a tax benefit of $267,000.    The maker of mobile homes, which went public in February, cited production and marketing problems.

Sales for the quarter increased about 5.5% to $30.4 million from $28.8 million, it said.    For the fiscal year, the company expects to report net of about $450,000, or 16 cents a share, which includes tax benefits of about $59,000; a year earlier, the company earned $838,000, or 34 cents a share, which included tax benefits of $365,000. Schult added that sales increased to about $115.3 million from $102.7 million.    Schult shares were quoted yesterday at $3.25 bid, off 50 cents, in over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
