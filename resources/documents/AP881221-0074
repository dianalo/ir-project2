A U.S. District Court jury found Judge John J. McDonnell guiltyTuesday on three counts of tax evasion, but could not reach averdict on two counts of extortion and one count apiece ofracketeering and obstructing justice.   U.S. District Judge James H. Alesia declared a mistrial on thosecounts, and U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said he would seek a retrial.   At a brief news conference after the verdict was announced,Valukas said he was convinced his staff had enough evidence toobtain McDonnell's conviction on the remaining charges.   Valukas personally prosecuted McDonnell, with the aid ofAssistant U.S. Attorney Tom Durkin.   ``There is no question in my mind,'' said Valukas, when asked ifhe thought it was worth prosecuting McDonnell again.   The jurors deliberated one hour Monday and most of the dayTuesday before returning the verdict against McDonnell, 53, a formerfederal prosecutor.   McDonnell, who was appointed to the bench in 1971, faces amaximum sentence of nine years in prison on the three tax evasioncounts.   Since his indictment nine months ago, McDonnell has not sat as ajudge, but has received his full judicial salary.   McDonnell was indicted by a federal grand jury March 16, alongwith retired Cook County Circuit Court Judge Francis J. Maher, Sr.The indictment accused the two of taking cash bribes to fix minortraffic, drugs and weapons cases, and of having steered such casesto certain lawyers.   McDonnell was also accused of extorting bribes from attorneys andtelling them not to disclose the extortion to authorities, as wellas of failing to report the alleged bribe money in his income taxreturns.   Defense attorney Patrick Tuite said after the verdict that thegovernment built its case on the testimony of three admittedbribe-paying former attorneys, whom he called ``sleazebags.''   The three, Bernard Mann, Cyrus Yonan and Karl Canavan, have allpleaded guilty to paying bribes to judges.   Operation Greylord, an undercover investigation of allegedcorruption in the Cook County court system, was first made public byfederal authorities in December 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
