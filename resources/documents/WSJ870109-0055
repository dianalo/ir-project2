The FCC said it is investigating whether Mr. Boesky failed to disclose that he controlled KGMC through a voting trust, and then transferred control of the station to his wife last month without government authorization.    In addition, the FCC said it is reviewing Mr. Boesky's qualifications to operate the station in light of his agreement to plead guilty to a felony count of violating insider-trading statutes. As reported, Mr. Boesky paid the government $100 million as part of the plea agreement.    Gary Schonman, an FCC investigator, said that in the KGMC case, Mr. Boesky faces a possible reprimand, a fine of as much as $20,000, or a hearing in which Mr. Boesky and his family could lose the license.    Mr. Boesky and his family acquired KGMC in 1983, and Mr. Boesky was listed as controlling about 4%. But Mr. Schonman said the FCC is investigating whether he controlled the station through a voting trust. License holders are required to disclose who controls a broadcast outlet. Details of the investigation appeared in yesterday's Washington Post and New York Times.    The FCC also is investigating two incidents that might constitute an unauthorized change in control to Mr. Boesky's wife, Seema. In September, Mrs. Boesky obtained from Mr. Boesky the right to vote the shares in the family trust.    Then on Dec. 16, Beverly Hills Hotel Corp., which owned 85% of KGMC, filed with the FCC to transfer control to Mrs. Boesky. As of Dec. 5, the filing says, Beverly Hills Hotel was controlled by Mrs. Boesky and members of the Slatkin family. Beverly Hills Hotel asserted in the filing that the transfer doesn't change &quot;ultimate control&quot; of KGMC. The filing also said Mr. Boesky &quot;inadvertently&quot; failed to disclose information about the voting trust because the arrangement pre-dated his family's acquisition of the station.    Charles Kelly, chief of enforcement for the FCC's mass media bureau, said that on Dec. 31, the agency informed a lawyer for the Boesky family that the agency wouldn't approve the transfer before Jan. 1. Nevertheless, Mr. Kelly said, the lawyer later informed the agency that the transfer had taken place on Dec. 31.    Harvey Pitt, an attorney for Mr. Boesky, declined to comment on the specifics of the FCC investigation. &quot;We will look at the situation and we'll respond in an appropriate fashion,&quot; he said. Grover Cooper, a lawyer for KGMC, said the license holders would release a statement today. </TEXT></DOC>
