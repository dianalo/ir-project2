The sealed indictments were returned Tuesday and were orderedunsealed Thursday after all but one had been arrested.   The indictments allege that cocaine and marijuana were sold to anundercover agent, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crews said.   ``The amounts of drugs are relatively small,'' he said. ``Whatmakes it exceptionally significant, to us, however, is that theoffenses are alleged to have occurred either at the serviceprocessing center or by individuals employed by the United States.And it's the position of this office that any amount is too muchwhen it comes to that.''   Crews said no detainees were involved in the alleged offenses.   In all, nine people were named in the indictments, officialssaid.
