Stephen Gabbert, president of the association that groups riceproducers in six U.S. states, said Thursday that Japan could starteasing some of its social problems _ such as high land, housing andfood prices _ by liberalizing its heavily-controlled rice market.   The U.S. government in late October rejected a petition by theRice Millers' Association to proceed with a complaint againstJapan's ban on rice imports, but also said Japan's policycontravened trade agreements and the millers' complaint could bereintroduced if there is no progress in easing the ban.   After laborious negotiations earlier this year, Japan agreed toaccept more U.S. beef and oranges. But it firmly has rejected callsto open its rice market.   Rice is Japan's staple food and the government's policy ofself-sufficiency in rice it requires massive subsidies to farmers.Retail rice prices are at least triple U.S. prices.   Gabbert told a news conference with foreign journalists thatJapan's rice policy ``is a fantastic example of economic distortion,and it basically stinks.''   He said bureaucrats in the Agriculture Ministry have nounderstanding of economic reality, and sharply criticized thenation's network of agricultural cooperatives, which are powerfulpolitical lobbyists with huge economic resources.   Japan's rice policy, Gabbert said, ``is tied to a cooperativeframework which I would characterize as basically an evil empire.''The cooperative movement is supposed to help Japanese farmers andconsumers, he said, but ``it exploits farmers and gouges consumers.''   Gabbert proposed a 2.5 percent a year opening of Japan's ricemarket over a four-year period. Ten percent of the rice market wouldbe as much as American growers could produce, he said, noting that25 percent of U.S. rice fields now are out of production.   If Japan liberalizes its market, he predicted Japanese farmerswould become more efficient, that land and housing prices would godown because some paddy land would be freed for housing, and thatJapanese consumers could spend less on agricultural products andmore on manufactured imports, thus further helping the countryreduce its huge trade surplus.   Gabbert was in Japan, which he said he had visited 20 times inthe past 15 years, to study his association's options as it decideswhat to do next in its drive to penetrate Japan's rice market.</TEXT></DOC>
