That is, the compounds      of the present invention provide antiarrhythmic activity. </PAR><PAR>  Antiarrhythmic activity of compounds which provide therapy is the mainstay      of long-term antiarrhythmic treatment. However, clinicians have long      sought the &quot;ideal&quot; antiarrhythmic compound. Such a compound has not yet      been found. </PAR><PAR>  Antiarrhythmic therapy and compounds providing beneficial antiarrhythmic      activity in relation to electrophysiological classes of action,      cardiovascular effects, and pharmacokinetic properties are known. See, for      example, K. Nademanee, et al., &quot;Advances in Antiarrhythmic Therapy, The      Role of Newer Antiarrhythmic Drugs&quot;, JAMA, vol. 247, no. 2, pp. 217-222      (Jan. 8, 1982). </PAR><PAR>  Antiarrhythmic activity is dependent on the effect of a compound on the      transmembrane potential of caridac tissue. Thus, antiarrhythmic compounds      may be classified according to the type of activity that they have on this      potential. Transmembrane potential or action potential of a typical      spontaneous depolarizing conducting fiber in the heart is reproduced as      FIG. 1 in a publication by D. T. Mason, et al. in Cardiovascular Drugs,      vol. 1, chapter III, ADIS Press, Sydney (1977). Besides the depolarization      phase noted as phase 0 in the Mason, et al. reference figure, other phases      1, 2, 3, and 4, are also shown. It is at the end of phase 3 that the      conducting fiber in the heart reaches its maximum level of polarization,      at which time the inside of a cell in the fiber is about 90 millivolts      more negative than the surrounding fluid. At this point the spontaneously      depolarizing cell begins to lose its polarization. This is phase 4 and is      known as &quot;automaticity.&quot; It is during phase 4 that pacemaker cells, for      example, the SA node of the right atrium, establish the heart rate. Loss      of polarization is under sympathetic control which via the      .beta.-adrenergic receptor increases the heart rate, and is under vagal      control which via cholinergic receptors slows the heart rate. Therefore,      .beta.-adrenergic blockers, also known as class II antiarrhythmic agents,      slow the heart rate by blocking the sympathetic control mechanism. </PAR><PAR>  Phase 0, the depolarization phase, occurs when the transmembrane potential      reaches a threshold potential. Such threshold potential is shown by the      FIG. 1 noted above to be about -75 mv. The mechanism of depolarization is      thought to be by influx of sodium ions and is accompanied by contraction      of the cardiac muscle. Regardless of the mechanism, when the threshold      potential is reached, a cell capable of undergoing phase 0 depolarization      will depolarize. If the threshold is reached due to the untimely      depolarization of adjacent diseased tissue the phenomenon of reentrant      arrhythmias can result. Phase 0 depolarization determines the conduction      velocity of the tissue. By far the greatest number of available      antiarrhythmic agents have an effect on this part of the action potential      and are known as Class I antiarrhythmic agents. Thus, Class I agents exert      their primary effect on phase 0 depolarization. An example of the effect      can be seen for quinidine in the FIG. I which is cited above. </PAR><PAR>  Phase 2 of the action potential is associated with a slow inward      transmembrane Ca.sup.andplus;andplus;  current. The slow channel calcium blockers known      as Class IV antiarrhythmic agents have an effect in this phase. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, the repolarization of the tissue is phase 3 and is associated with      a rapid efflux of potassium ion. </PAR><PAR>  For a period of time between phase 0 and phase 3 of the action potential      the tissue is unresponsive to a second depolarizing stimulus. This period      is known as the refractory period; it is directly related to the duration      of the action potential. As early as 1970 it was suggested that drugs      which prolong the refractory period could prevent or abolish ventricular      tachyarrhythmias and fibrillation. The suggestion is reviewed extensively      by J. Thomis et al. in &quot;Ann. Reports in Medicinal Chemistry&quot;, vol. 18, H.      J. Hess, Ed., Academic Press, New York, N.Y., Chapter 11, (1983).      Compounds which prolong the refractory period are known as Class III      antiarrhythmia agents. Thus, it is now becoming apparent that the Class      III rather than the Class I agents are useful for preventing resistant,      life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. See K. Nademanee et al. cited      above and B. N. Singh, et al., &quot;A Third Class of Antiarrhythmic Action.      Effects on Atrial and Ventricular Intracellular Potentials, and Other      Pharmacological Actions on Cardiac Muscle, of MJ 1999 and AH 3474,&quot; Br. J.      Pharmac., 39, 675-687 (1970). </PAR><PAR>  The compounds, both the novel compounds and the novel intermediates of the      present invention are of these Class III type compounds useful for their      antiarrhythmic effect. </PAR><PAC>  INFORMATION DISCLOSURE </PAC><PAR>  U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,341,584 and 3,478,149, both assigned to Mead Johnson,      disclose sulfonanilides which are pharmacologically active      phenethanolamines having both peripheral and CNS activity. The      sulfonanilides disclosed include combinations of substituents representing      a wide generic scope. For example, a side chain having various amines is      presented. These amines are of primary, secondary or tertiary types. No      tertiary type compounds are identified as a class or separate subgenus by      the Mead Johnson patent as having the special properties now found in the      present invention. Specifically, the above noted Mead Johnson patents      disclose 4'-andlsqb;1-hydroxy-2-(isopropylamino)ethylandrsqb;methanesulfonanilide and      its hydrochloride acid addition salt which are also now identified in the      literature as sotalol hydrochloride hereinafter sotalol or MJ 1999. In      addition to the uses in the above cited patents sotalol has subsequently      been identified as a .beta.-adrenergic blocker or as having      .beta.-sympatholytic effects. Further, sotalol is also found to have Class      III antiarrhythmic activity. See B. N. Singh et al. cited above, D. H.      Bennett, Br. Heart J., 47, 521 (1982) and Symposia Reporter, 6, 2 (1982). </PAR><PAR>  Phenalkylamine compounds containing the combination of phenolic hydroxyl      and sulfonanilide substituents are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,574,741.      These compounds are disclosed as having sympathomimetic activity including      adrenergic vasoconstrictor activity. However, the compounds all require      the presence of a hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring and none of them are      quarternary ammonium salts. </PAR><PAR>  In U.S. Pat. No. 3,660,487 phenethanolamines with      N-(alkyl)alkanesulfonamido and hydroxy substituents are described. These      compounds are described as being capable of suppressing both alpha and      beta adrenergic stimulation. All of the compounds disclosed require the      presence of a hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring and there are no      quarternary ammonium compounds disclosed. </PAR><PAR>  The novel compounds of formula I which are quaternary ammonium type      compounds and the novel intermediates of formula II which are tertiary      amino type compounds of the present invention have antiarrhythmic      activity; in particular Class III activity or a combination of Class I and      Class III activity. The compounds of formulas I and II herein do not      exhibit .beta.-blocking activity. Furthermore, the intermediate tertiary      amines of formula II provide surprising and unexpectedly better      antiarrhythmic activity when compared to sotalol and the quaternary amines      of formula I have demonstrated an absence of CNS activity. Thus, the novel      compounds of the present invention and the novel intermediates of the      present invention are not obvious and/or provide unexpected and surprising      results in view of the Mead Johnson patents. In fact, because of its CNS      and/or .beta.-sympatholytic effects as taught by the Mead Johnson patents,      the use of sotalol as a Class III agent in some cases may be      contraindicated as compared to the present invention compounds. </PAR><PAR>  Clofilium bromide which is 4-chloro-N,N-diethyl-N-heptyl      benzenebutanaminium bromide is a species in a generic disclosure for      quaternary ammonium salts having use for treating arrhythmias and      prolonging the action potential of cardiac tissue. The disclosure of      clofilium bromide and other compounds generically related thereto is found      in U.S. Pat. No. 4,289,787. These compounds do not however encompass      compounds having a sulfonanilide substituent such as now found in the      present invention. Further, the suggestion that the antiarrhythmic      activity of clofilium bromide is due to its effect on the refractory      period discussed above is disputed. See G. Kopia, et al., Federation      Proc., 40, 673 (1981) and G. Kopia, et al., Circulation, 64, IV-124      (1981). Certainly, results of clofilium bromide in tests on the refractory      period of rabbit papillary muscle as set out for compounds of the present      invention support such disputations. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention particularly provides: </PAR><PAR>  (1) a compound having the formula I/II </PAR><PA1>  wherein the R--SO.sub.2 --N(R.sub.6)-- moiety is in the 2, 3 or 4 position      of the aromatic ring;

In addition to methods for making these compounds, definitions of terms,      pharmaceutical compositions, laboratory testing procedures, preparations      and examples are described. </PAR><PAR>  The following terms are defined as follows: </PAR><PAR>  Alkyls are identified herein as having from one to twelve carbons, and      include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl,      decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and isomers thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Alkoxy is denoted as having from one to three carbons, inclusive, and thus      includes methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or isopropoxy. In like manner, alkylthio      of from one to three carbons is methylthio, ethylthio, propylthio, and      isopropylthio. </PAR><PAR>  Cycloalkyl of from five to twelve carbons, inclusive, is cyclopentyl,      cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, methylcyclopentyl, ethylcyclopentyl,      methylcyclohexyl, cyclodecyl, cyclododecyl, ethylcyclononyl,      dimethylcyclooctyl, ethylpropylcycloheptyl, including cycloalkyl      substituted by alkyl such that the total number of carbon atoms does not      exceed twelve, and the like. </PAR><PAR>  A saturated heterocycle having a nitrogen atom and from four to twelve      carbons includes pyrrolidine, piperidine, hexamethyleneimine, and      heptamethyleneimine and the like. </PAR><PAR>  X.sup.- means halides, sulfates, phosphates, sulfonates, maleates,      citrates, tartrates, fumarates, acetates, and the like. </PAR><PAR>  Substituents having prefixes C.sub.n -C.sub.m refer to the number of carbon      atoms in all isomeric forms and is inclusive such that C.sub.1 -C.sub.4      alkyl includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl,      isobutyl and secbutyl. </PAR><PAR>  Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I/II are      considered to be a part of this invention and have the physiological uses      referred to herein. </PAR><PAR>  The compounds of formula II are amphoteric substances forming salts with      both acids and bases. The compounds of formula I form salts with bases and      can also exist as internal salts. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include the      hydrochloride, hydrobromide, acetate, propionate, phosphate, nitrate,      succinate, gluconate, sulfate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate,      p-toluenesulfonate, hydroiodide, citrate, lactate, fumarate, benzoate,      salicylate, pamoate, cyclohexanesulfamate, and the like. Pharmaceutically      acceptable salts formed with bases include the sodium, potassium, lithium,      magnesium, calcium, barium, zinc, and aluminum salts. </PAR><PAR>  The present salts can be prepared in conventional fashion by treatment of      one of the present compounds with an acid or base. For the preparation of      salts with monobasic acids and monoacidic bases, use of equimolar      quantities of the two reactants is convenient. In the formation of salts      of polyacidic bases and polybasic acids, one or more chemical equivalents      of the acid or base can be employed. </PAR><PAR>  The method of use for the treatment of arrhythmias with the compounds I/II      of the present invention may be therapeutic or prophylactic. The      employment of sound medical therapy requires the compounds I/II be      employed only where the animal or human has, or is susceptible to the      development of, arrhythmias. Particularly, the compounds I/II of the      present invention are for treating patients susceptible to ventricular      arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation      which are associated with sudden death. Thus, the compounds I/II are      useful for treating patients preferably human patients who are suffering      from angina, ischemic heart diseases or other cardiac dysfunctions which      may be associated with conditions contributing to cardiac rhythm      disorders. The conditions and circumstances which; (1) require      antiarrhythmic treatment, or (2) increase susceptibility to arrhythmias      are readily ascertained by the ordinarily skilled physician or      veterinarian. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to the above described compounds, process and method of use,      the invention embraces compositions having the compound of formula I/II      wherein n, R, R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3, R.sub.4, R.sub.5, R.sub.6,      R.sub.7, R.sub.8, R.sub.9, X.sup.-, and Z are as defined above in      combination with a pharmaceutical carrier. </PAR><PAR>  Combinations of the compounds of formula I/II with various antiarrhythmic      agents known in the art are also within the scope of this invention. For      example, combinations may include, Class I antiarrhythmic agents, such as      quinidine, tocainide, lidocaine or the like; Class II antiarrhythmic      agents, such as, propranolol, atenolol or the like; Class III      antiarrhythmic agents such as clofilium, sotalol, amiodarone and      meobentine; and Class IV antiarrhythmic agents such as verapamil or      diltiazem. </PAR><PAR>  Various dosage forms may be employed, such as oral dosage forms including      tablets, powders, capsules, and solutions or suspensions in suitable      solvent, or parenteral dosage forms, such as sterile solutions in water or      other suitable solvents. The compounds of formula I/II are used in unit      dosages of 0.03 to 50 mg/kg in dosage forms for administration by routes      either oral, sublingual, transdermal, or parenteral such as by      subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous injection and the like dosage      forms. </PAR><PAR>  The compositions of the present invention may also include sustained      release oral dosage forms and controlled release dosage forms by which the      effect of the dosage is, for example, through the skin. Such compositions      are those known to an oridinarily skilled artisan or can be ascertained by      ordinary experimentation from known compositions. </PAR><PAR>  The exact dose depends on the age, weight, and condition of the patient and      on the frequency and route of administration. Such variations are within      the skill of the practitioner or can be readily determined. </PAR><PAR>  The tests used for assessing the increase in refractoriness produced by the      compounds of the present invention are as follows. </PAR><PAR>  Rabbits (1.5-2.0 kg) of either sex are anesthetized with ether and their      hearts removed. The heart is immersed in perfusate while the atria,      papillary muscles and a right ventricular (RV) strip are isolated. The      tissues are individually mounted on a plexiglass holder containing      platinum stimulating electrodes and suspended in a 100 ml bath. Right      atria are allowed to contract spontaneously. RV strips are stimulated      (Grass S8 with SI unit) at 2.times. threshold with 4 msec rectangular      pulses at a frequency of 2 Hz. Papillary muscles are stimulated (Grass S88      with SI and CC unit) at 2.times. threshold with 4 msec rectangular pulses      at a frequency of 1 and 3 Hz. The tissue is attached by silk suture to a      force-displacement transducer (Glass FT03) and each is gently stretched to      the peak of its own length-tension relationship by gradually increasing      the preload. </PAR><PAR>  Isometric tension and its electronically differentiated signal (.andplus;-.dF/dt)      are recorded on a polygraph (7D). To measure the effective refractory      period (ERP), a premature stimulus S.sub.2 is introduced after every      eighth pacing stimulus S.sub.1. The ERP is defined as the shortest S.sub.1      S.sub.2 interval (msec) that provokes a premature contraction. The ERP is      separately measured at each of two pacing frequencies S.sub.1 andequals;1 and 3 Hz,      with S.sub.2 voltage equal to S.sub.1 voltage. The maximum following      frequency (MFF) is measured by incrementally increasing the S.sub.1 rate      until the tissue is no longer able to follow each stimulus and adopts a      2:1 rhythm. MFF is inversely proportional to ERP (1000/MFF)andequals;ERP in msec.      To record changes in tissue conduction time (CTIME), teflon coated silver      bipolar electrodes are gently placed against the endocardial surface of      the RV strip. The biphasic electrogram is displayed on an oscilloscope      (Tektronix Type 502A). Polaroid photographs of the potentials are taken      and changes in CTIME are measured from the photographs. Since the      positions of the recording electrode relative to the stimulating electrode      remain constant throughout an experiment, an increase in CTIME is      equivalent to a decrease in conduction velocity. </PAR><PAR>  The temperature of the baths and perfusate is maintained at 30.degree. C.      by a circulating heat pump (Haake Type F) connected to a glass heat      exchanger. The tissue perfusate contains (mM): NaCl 118; KCl 5.4;      NaHCO.sub.3 25; MgCl.sub.2 1.2; KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 1; CaCl.sub.2 2.4 and      glucose 10. The normoxic perfusate is aerated with 95% O2 plus 5% CO.sub.2      which buffered the solution to pH 7.410 PO.sub.2 568 and PCO.sub.2 35      mmHg. </PAR><PAR>  Illustrative examples are for each of 9 different compounds. Of these, one      is sotalol, one is clofilium bromide, three are known analogs thereof (the      known compounds are described in Table 2 and are compounds of Formula III)      and four are novel compounds or novel intermediates of this invention (see      Table 1) synthesized according to the procedures discussed herein. Each      compound is dissolved in tissue perfusate and 10.sup.-2 molar stock      solutions are prepared. These solutions are kept at 4.degree. C. After      control measurements, increasing concentrations of test compound are added      in microliter aliquots to each bath. Noncumulative dose effects are      measured 30 minutes later and the tissue washed. </PAR><PAR>  Each tissue serves as its own control. Data are reported as mean percent      change.andplus;-.SEM. Paired t-tests are used to evaluate significance at the      pandlt;0.05 level. </PAR><PAR>  Table 1 shows the results of testing for each of four compounds which are      novel compounds or novel intermediates of the present invention by the      means described above to show antiarrhythmic effect. </PAR><PAR>  Table 2 shows the results of testing sotalol compound No. 1, clofilium      compound No. 2, which are both named and discussed above, and three      analogs thereof. The testing is accomplished in the same means as used for      testing the compounds of Table 1. </PAR><PAR>  In both of the above Tables 1 and 2 descriptions for the various markings      are as follows: </PAR><PAR>  A single arrow indicates a statistically significant change (increase or      decrease) usually greater than a 10% change from control. </PAR><PAR>  A double arrow indicates a greater than 30% change. </PAR><PAR>  An arrow in parentheses (.uparw.) indicates that the change was not      statistically significant. </PAR><PAR>  An asterisk indicates that the effect appears to be dose related. </PAR><PAR>  The molar concentrations of the compounds in the tissue perfusate are      indicated. </PAR><PAR>  CT is the change in time required to conduct a pulse between two electrodes      mounted on a strip of right ventricular tissue, an increase in CT      represents a decrease in conduction velocity. </PAR><PAR>  ERP1 and ERP3 represent changes in the effective refractory period of      papillary muscles stimulated at a constant frequency of 1 or 3 Hz      respectively. </PAR><PAR>  MFF represents the change in maximum following frequency of the papillary      muscle determined by gradually increasing the stimulus frequency until the      tissue is no longer able to respond on a one to one basis. A decrease in      MFF indicates an increase in effective refractory period. </PAR><PAR>  andplus;dF/dt is a measure of the contractility of the tissue during the up stroke      or phase O of the action potential. A decrease in andplus;dF/dt is an indication      of a decrease in contractility or negative inotropic effect--an      undesirable effect on the tissue. </PAR><PAR>  Auto is an indication of the change in the rate of spontaneous contraction      (automaticity) of the right atrial tissue. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to their antiarrhythmic activity, the compounds of formula I      have a positive inotropic activity which will make them useful for      treating conditions requiring increased myocardial contractility. Such      conditions are generally found in chronic cardiac failure. A specific      compound that has this property is compound No. 4 in Table 1. </PAR><PAR>  It is readily apparent from Table 1 that the compounds of this invention      increase the refractoriness of cardiac tissue but do not have undesirable      effects at the concentrations tested. Each gives a much better effect on      the refractory period than either sotalol (No. 1 in Table 2) or clofilium      (No. 2 in Table 2). </PAR><PAR>  Further, compound No. 1 of Table 1 is found to be inactive in a CNS      receptor binding assay for opiate, antipsychotic, benzodiazepine,      muscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, alpha-1 adrenergic, alpha-2      adrenergic and serotonergic activity. This inactivity suggests that this      specific compound and members of the tertiary amine type compounds do not      have undesirable effects on these receptors. This is contrary to the      teaching for sotalol and analogs of sotalol as disclosed in the Mead      Johnson patents cited above which are claimed to have adrenergic agonist      and antagonist effects. Some compounds of formula II, including No. 1 of      Table 1, have been determined to exert behavioral effects suggestive of      some type of CNS activity in the conscious dog. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, the compounds having the formula I, for example, 2., 3., and 4.,      of Table 1 are prepared from novel intermediates having the formula II.      Both novel intermediates having formula II and novel compounds having      formula I are limited to substituents not including --C(.dbd.O) in place      of --CH(R.sub.2)--. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, the process of this invention requires a tertiary amine of      formula II to obtain a quaternary amine as N.sup.andplus; R.sub.3 R.sub.4 R.sub.5      X.sup.- in the novel compounds of formula I. Thus, the definitions      required as R.sub.2, R.sub.4 and R.sub.5 in formula II can be said to      contribute to the significant increase in desirable refractoriness of      cardiac tissue provided by the compounds of formula I having related      definitions without other undesirable effects as found for compounds      previously known. </PAR><PAR>  Processes for preparing the compounds of the present invention having      formula I/II include processes to prepare novel intermediates II and      processes to prepare novel compounds I from the novel intermediates II.      Generally, these processes are described in the following material and      shown in Charts I-XIII. </PAR><PAR>  The intermediate compounds herein and compounds of the formula I/II are      isolated from their reaction mixtures by methods known in the art such as      extraction, crystallization, chromatographic procedures and the like. </PAR><PAR>  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that when the R.sub.2      substituent of formula I/II is hydroxy, the compound has an asymmetric      carbon atom. Where the methylene bridge joining the amine to the      sulfonanilide does not contain an additional assymetric carbon atom two      enantiomorphic forms exist. Where the methylene bridge does contain an      additional asymmetric carbon, two racemic modifications of the product      exists each of which consists of a pair of enantiomorphic forms. All of      these enantiomers and mixtures thereof and other stereoisomeric forms of      the substances of formula I/II are included within the scope of this      invention. </PAR><PAR>  In using the methods of the following charts and their descriptions herein,      as would be evident to those skilled in the art, care must be taken to      avoid undesirably altering additional functional groups present. It is      believed that sufficient synthetic steps and sequences of steps are      disclosed herein to allow considerable flexibility in choosing a synthetic      path which does not undesirably change additional functional groups      present. The requirements for, and the use of, protecting groups are known      by those skilled in the art: e.g., for the protection of amine or hydroxy      functionality. See for example: J. F. W. McOmie, Advances in Organic      Chemistry, 3: 191-281 (1963); R. A. Boissonas, Advances in Organic      Chemistr, 3: 159-190 (1963); &quot;Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry,&quot; J.      F. W. McOmie, Ed., Plenum Press, New York, 1963, pg. 74; and &quot;Protective      Groups in Organic Synthesis,&quot; Theodora W. Greene, John Wiley and Sons, New      York, 1981. </PAR><PAR>  In the following charts, acetophenone intermediates for compounds of      formula I/II where R.sub.1 is halogen are made by known methods, e.g.      Lutz, R. E., et al., J. Org. Chem., 12: 617-703 at 681, 1947. Preparations      11 and 12 below exemplify halogenation processes. </PAR><PAC>  CHART I </PAC><PAR>  In Chart I Steps I and IX, sulfonanilides are prepared by the reaction of      an aniline, which is known or made by known procedures, with the      appropriate sulfonyl chloride. A tertiary amine base is usually used to      neutralize the acid formed in the reaction; pyridine or triethylamine can      be used for this purpose; however, if desired an excess of the aniline can      be employed. Solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide toluene      or pyridine (in excess) can be used. </PAR><PAR>  Continuing in Chart I Step II, the sulfonanilide prepared in Step I is used      to prepare an arylketone. </PAR><PAR>  The arylketone is preferably prepared in Step II via a Friedel-Crafts      reaction of the sulfonanilide with an appropriate acyl halide or      anhydride. Catalysts for this reaction include aluminum chloride or other      Lewis acid; solvents include carbon disulfide, chlorobenzene or other      inert solvent. </PAR><PAR>  The same arylketone prepared in Step II may also be prepared in Step X from      the acetophenone which is product of Step IX. That is, bromination of      acetophenones can be accomplished with bromine in solvents such as diethyl      ether, chloroform or methylene chloride. Peroxides such as benzoyl      peroxide can be used as catalysts. </PAR><PAR>  Then, finally in Chart I the arylketone may be treated as shown in Steps IV      and V to obtain the compound of formula II.sub.1 or may be treated as      shown in Steps III and VII to obtain the compounds of formula II.sub.2.      Each of these steps is generally carried out in the following manner: </PAR><PAR>  Step III--Alkylation of an amine with a halide is usually carried out in a      solvent such as a lower alkanol, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide,      acetonitrile, or dimethylsulfoxide. An excess of the amine is often used      to neutralize the acid formed in the reaction and to promote formation of      the monoalkylation product. Other bases such as alkali metal carbonates      can also be used to neutralize the acid. </PAR><PAR>  Step IV--Reduction of an aryl ketone of this type to the corresponding      hydrocarbon can be accomplished with a trialkylsilane and an acid      according to the method of Doyle and coworkers andlsqb;C. T. West et al., J. Org.      Chem. 38, 2675 (1973)andrsqb;. At least two equivalents of the trialkylsilane,      conveniently triethylsilane, are required but an excess can be used if      desired. An excess of the acid, usually trifluoroacetic acid, is employed,      often as the solvent; however, cosolvents such as carbon tetrachloride,      acetonitrile or nitromethane can also be used. Temperatures of      25.degree.-100.degree. C. can be employed in the reaction. </PAR><PAR>  Step V--See Step III above for generally effective process conditions. </PAR><PAR>  Step VII--Reduction of the arylketones can be accomplished by catalytic      hydrogenation using, for example, palladium catalysts such as      palladium-on-carbon or by chemical methods such as sodium borohydride in      alcoholic or aqueous alcoholic solvents or sodium cyanoborohydride in      acidic media such as dilute hydrochloric acid with or without an organic      cosolvent such as an alcohol or acetonitrile. </PAR><PAR>  Step VIIIa--An adaptation of the procedure of G. A. Reynolds, et al.,      Organic Synthesis Collective, Vol. IV: 708-710, (1963) is used. An      appropriately substituted nitrobenzoic acid, which is prepared by known      methods, is converted to the acid chloride by refluxing with excess      thionyl chloride. The resulting benzoyl chloride is reacted with diethyl      ethoxymagnesium malonate in dry diethyl ether. The crude diethyl      nitrobenzoylmalonate is refluxed with an aqueous acetic acid-sulfuric acid      mixture to produce the desired substituted acetophenone. </PAR><PAR>  Step VIII--The nitro group of an appropriately substituted      nitroacetophenone is reduced to produce the corresponding aniline by known      methods such as heating with stannous chloride dihydrate in absolute      ethanol. </PAR><PAR>  When R.sub.6 of a formula I/II compound is to be methyl, this methyl group      can be introduced by using in the synthesis of the said formula I/II      compound an appropriate N-methyl substituted starting material which is      known or can be made by known methods. For example, referring to Chart I,      the starting material for Steps II or X are N-methylated as in Step XI by      reaction with a suitable base, for example sodium hydride, in a suitable      solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, or the like, or      mixtures of such solvents, followed by reaction with methyl chloride,      bromide or iodide to form the desired N-methylated compound.

The organic pool is washed with brine, dried      (Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4) and concentrated to give a dark oil. This material is      chromatographed over 500 ml of silica gel (eluted with 0.4% NH.sub.4 OH-8%      MeOH--CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2); 45 ml fractions are collected. The resulting      material is further treated with cold, dilute NaOH to pH 12 and extracted      with EtOAc (1.times.40 ml). The organic extract is washed with cold,      dilute NaOH (2.times.5 ml) and the pooled aqueous wash extracted with      EtOAc (2.times.25 ml) (each extract is washed with 5 ml of H.sub.2 O). The      pooled EtOAc extract is dried (Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4) and concentrated in      vacuo to give the title compound. The title compound is chromatographed      over 50 ml of silica gel (eluted with 0.25% NH.sub.4 OH-10% MeOH--CH.sub.2      Cl.sub.2) and 20 ml fractions collected.
