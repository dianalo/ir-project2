Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual head of thepro-Iranian group Hezbollah, told the pro-Syrian Beirut dailyAsh-Sharq: ``In my opinion, America is following a plan for freezingthe issue of the hostages at the media level.''   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is widely believed to be the umbrellafor Shiite factions holding most of the 16 foreign hostages inLebanon.   ``America can free its hostages in a very simple way,'' Fadlallahwas quoted as saying.   ``Instead, the United States is using the hostages as a blackmailcard in its so-called war against terrorism,'' Fadlallah added,without elaboration.   Eight Americans are among the 16 Western hostages held inLebanon. Thehostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March16, 1985.   In Kuwait, the newspaper Al-Qabas reported Thursday that Westernhostages in Lebanon could be released soon as a result of recentintensive contacts between Syria and Iran.   Numerous articles speculating on the release of Western hostageshave appeared in the Lebanese and Arab press in the past few years,but few have been correct.   Syria and Iran are allies in the 14-year-old Lebanese civil war,backing the Lebanese Moslems against the Christians.   In a London dispatch, Al-Qabas quoted Arab diplomatic sources assaying the release of the foreign hostages was the key topic oftalks this week between Iranian officials and Syrian ForeignMinister Farouk al-Sharaa.   The sources were quoted as predicting the hostages would be freedin stages.</TEXT></DOC>
