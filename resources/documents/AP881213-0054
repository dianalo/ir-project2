The body of the merchant seaman was flown by a Navy helicopter toWilcox Memorial Hospital on the island of Kauai, nursing supervisorLillian Teshima.   The Indian vessel Jagvivek, bound for Singapore with an unknowncargo, was in Navy's Pacific Missile Range 200 miles northwest ofHonolulu, even though the area was closed to commercial shippingbecause of military operations, the Navy said.   Navy authorities are investigating the incident.   In New Delhi, the Indian government declined comment.   The FA-18 Hornet attack fighter from the aircraft carrier USSConstellation launched the 12-foot-long, 1,000-pound, unarmedmissile during a training mission toward a target hulk ship manymiles out to sea, the Navy said.   ``Unfortunately the exercise missile was fired close enough tothe path of the merchant vessel for the missile's seeker to guide onit instead of the original target,'' the Navy said in a statement.   The impact of the nonexplosive missile into the ship's structureabove the main deck killed the crewman and collapsed part of thestructure, the Navy said.   Two Navy ships were sent to assist the Jagvivek and a Navy doctorand a medical corpsman went aboard. They pronounced the crewman deadat the scene, the Navy said.   Ms. Teshima did not disclose the type of injuries he suffered.His name was not released.   The Constellation and seven other ships in its battle group wereconducting training exercises en route to a Western Pacificdeployment, the Navy said.   The thousands of square miles of ocean that make up the PacificMissile Range frequently are closed to civilian craft withadvisories broadcast at set times each day on marine radiofrequencies, according to the Coast Guard.   Accidents involving civilian vessels in the training area arerare, but not unprecedented.   In May 1975, two jets from the aircraft carrier USS Kittyhawkdropped several 20-pound practice bombs, just missing a 20-footcabin cruiser that the pilots apparently mistook for a target craft,according to newspaper files.   Navy officials in that case said the boat's skipper had ignoredwarnings to stay out of the restricted area.</TEXT></DOC>
