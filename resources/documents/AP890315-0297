Now, under an experiment by the Canadian subsidiary of PrudentialInsurance Co., the 44-year-old Ontario man has received $25,000 ofhis own death benefits to make his last days more livable.   ``Having the money, being able to pay my share of expenses,really helped bring back part of my self-esteem,'' said ``Ron,'' whospoke on condition that his real name not be used.   He is one of only five people to receive ``living benefits,''under a program that has paid out less than $100,000. Prudentialofficials and insurance industry experts believe it could be theprecursor to a future where the terminally ill can tap into lifeinsurance benefits to help with medical and living costs.   ``We are working here in the United States on the possibility ofoffering living benefits for hospice and nursing home care and organtransplants,'' said Joseph Vecchione, Prudential's vice presidentfor public relations. ``We realize that such efforts could serveimportant social purposes.''   The Canadian experiment was the creation of Ron Barbaro,president for Prudential's Canadian operations. Barbaro, afund-raiser for a Toronto AIDS hospice, learned that AIDS victimsare often thrown into poverty, left with few resources and littledignity.   ``I asked why we couldn't forget the rule that you needed a deathcertificate in order to pay benefits,'' he said. ``I thought weshould look to the other side of the ledger and do something forcustomers who are suffering terrible indignities.''   Encouraged by his parent company, Barbaro sought out terminallyill policy holders. Prudential medical officials contacted thepolicy holders' doctors beginning last summer and negotiations werebegun.   ``The beneficiaries have been more than cooperative,'' said GlennDaniels, assistant general counsel for Prudential's Canadian branch.   Under the agreements, money is given to the policy holder as aloan against the balance of the death benefits. In Ron's case, hereceived $25,000 of the $35,000 policy. His beneficiary, a friend,readily agreed.   When the policy holder dies, Prudential figures the amount ofinterest it would have earned on the money already paid out anddeducts that sum from the remainder of the death benefits.   Daniels said that allows the policy holder to get the money earlywithout costing the insurance company lost interest on the sum.   ``Nobody loses,'' he said.   For Ron, who lost his $56,000-a-year job because of his illness,the money eased the stress of filing for bankruptcy and living onwelfare for most of the six years he's been diagnosed with AIDS.   ``The first thing I did with the money was to go out and have avery good meal,'' he said.   He moved to a larger apartment, bought new clothes, a stereo anda washer and dryer, which allowed him to do his own laundry for thefirst time in months. His illness had left him too weak to carry hisclothes to the laundromat.   ``It gave me back a sense of independence and self-esteem,'' hesaid.   Ron also used part of the money to travel 1,200 miles for areunion and reconciliation with his family.   ``It all meant a great deal to me,'' he said. ``I think it's themost compassionate innovative piece of management I've come acrossin years.''   While the pilot program isn't solely for AIDS patients _Barbaro's unit is now helping a policy holder with an inoperablebrain tumor _ AIDS advocates hail the Prudential program as animportant step.   ``The insurance industry as a whole has had a business-as-usualapproach to AIDs and has done very little to come up with newapproaches,'' said Ben Schatz, director of the National Gay RightsAdvocates' AIDS Civil Rights Project and a member of the AIDSadvisory committee of the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners.   Still, it may be a long time before U.S. insurers adopt similarplans.   ``We are serious about the program, but we don't know what we'llencounter when we get to the regulatory route,'' Prudential'sVecchione said, noting that every state has its own insuranceindustry regulations.   He pointed to another potential problem: ``The proceeds of a lifeinsurance policy to a beneficiary are tax free. We don't knowwhether that would apply in this case.''   Although a handful of U.S. insurance companies offer specialpolicies that provide payment before death, John Booth, vicepresident and chief actuary of the American Council of LifeInsurance, said insurance companies may be leery of adapting such aprogram on a large scale.   One reason is the cost of negotiating each claim could becomeastronomical if it became available to the hundreds of thousands ofpeople diagnosed each year with a terminal disease. In 1987 the U.S.insurance industry paid $20 billion in death benefits.   Booth also said there are fears that such a program wouldencourage those with terminal illnesses to try to buy life insurance.   Despite the problems, Barbaro believes his program willeventually be adopted by U.S. insurers. ``I think it's inevitablebased on the simplicity of the idea.''</TEXT></DOC>
