About 64.8 million people, or 25 percent of the U.S. population,lived in rural areas in 1988, an increase of more than 900,000 from1987. The total included approximately 4.95 million living on farms,or 2 percent of the population, a decrease of 35,000 from theprevious year.   The report was prepared by the Agriculture and Commercedepartments using estimates from the Census Bureau's monthly currentpopulation survey.   Since 1986, when a new system of counting noses in thecountryside began, the rural population has grown more rapidly thanthe urban population, averaging 2.64 percent, compared with 1.67percent.   ``The 1988 farm population estimate of 4,951,000 is notsignificantly different from the 1987 estimate, which may reflect aleveling off in the long-term decline in the number of farmresidents,'' the report said.   One of the report's authors, Judith Kalbacher of the USDA'sEconomic Research Service, said the rural figures overall have shownsignificant changes but cautioned that the growth pattern since 1986may be illusory.   ``When the urban areas are redefined after the 1990 census, someof these growing rural areas will be reclassified as urban,'' shesaid in a telephone interview. ``Some of the growing areas are goingto be taken out of rural groups, and that will make it look likethere was less rural growth'' than is now being reported.   As used in the report, rural areas include open countryside andplace of fewer than 2,500 people that are not in the suburbs oflarge cities. Large cities and their suburbs, plus places of 2,500or more, are considered urban.   The farm population consists of people living on farms in ruralareas, but does not include the relatively few who live on farms inurban areas, the report said. A farm is defined as a place that soldagricultural products worth $1,000 or more in the previous year.   Kalbacher said urban sprawl and a willingness of city workers tocommute greater distances have been important factors in the ruralgrowth. Families moving to distant suburbs, for example, have helpedboost the annual counts for rural areas.   ``It probably means that a lot of the rural growth that we'reseeing in the mid-decade (of the 1980s) is mostly fringe developmentaround urbanized areas, she said.   The report said that the largest share of the rural population,44 percent, is in the South, ``which has been the case since thefirst census was taken in 1790.'' Little change in the regionaldistribution of rural people has occurred in the last 40 years.   The farm population, however, has shown ``marked change'' overthe same period. In 1950, for example, the South accounted for 51.6percent of farm people, but only 29.6 percent in 1988. The Midwest,meanwhile, accounted for 50.6 percent last year, compared with 32.3percent in 1950.   Other observations in the report included:   _Farm residents are older, with a median age of 38 years in 1988,compared with 32.2 years for all non-farm people. In 1920, themedian age of farm people was less than 21 years. A median age meanshalf of the people are older, half younger. Non-farm refers to urbanplus rural non-farm people.   _Last year 97.1 percent of farm residents were white, and 2.2percent were black, compared with 84.2 percent white and 12.4percent black in the non-farm population. The remainder weredescribed as ``other'' races.   _Only 2.8 percent of the farm residents were Hispanic.   _About 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older weremarried and living with a spouse in 1988, compared with 56 percentof the non-farm people.</TEXT></DOC>
