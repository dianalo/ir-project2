The swift sales of the thrifts, which held nearly $50billion in assets, were a big morale boost for the Sandamp;Lbailout agency, which began from scratch 10 months ago. Itsold just 55 thrifts during the first seven months of the Sandamp;Lcleanup.</LP><TEXT>   But the $45 billion in cash required by the RTC for thesales in the latest quarter helped spur the budgetnegotiations between the White House and Congress, and were afactor in President Bush's conceding that a tax increase isnecessary to reduce the budget deficit.   The RTC will run out of cash some time after October, theagency said, and unless the budget summit clears the way formore funding, the agency will have to delay further sales ofinsolvent thrifts. A Treasury official last week said theBush administration is depending on the budget negotiators todevise a funding plan. &quot;Beyond that, we have no Plan B,&quot; hesaid.   The transactions Friday included the sale of CenTrustSavings Bank, Miami, a thrift made famous by the excesses ofits chairman, David Paul. CenTrust was acquired by GreatWestern Financial Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., in atransaction requiring a record $1.7 billion of assistance. Inaddition, units of Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles,purchased Gibraltar Savings of Simi Valley, Calif., and theWashington state offices of Gibraltar Savings, Seattle.   The RTC estimates it will save nearly $200 million thisyear in operating and funding costs related to theinstitutions it sold this past quarter. &quot;This accomplishmentputs us on schedule and allows the RTC to move forward withour original operating plan of completing 50 to 75resolutions a quarter,&quot; said RTC Chairman William Seidman.   The Sandamp;L industry's losses result from the bad investmentsthat institutions made, using federally insured deposits. Inthe deals so far, the RTC estimates that it transferred orsold about half of those assets to buyers. But many of thosetransactions include terms that allow the buyers to returnthe assets to the government if the buyer finds fraud orunderwriting problems.   The industrywide cleanup, including interest, will costupward of $300 billion over 10 years. Including Friday'sflurry of deals, the RTC has completed transactions covering207 failed thrifts. A spokesman for the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. estimated the losses of those transactions at$26 billion, based on preliminary data.   The transactions Friday included:                                                                                                          -- Gibraltar Savings andamp; Loan Association, a Simi Valleythrift with $6.7 billion in assets, was sold to SecurityPacific National Bank, Los Angeles. Security Pacific willassume all deposits and some secured liabilities, totaling$5.5 billion, and agreed to purchase $5.3 billion of thefailed thrift's assets. The RTC estimates the transactionwill ultimately cost the government $521.6 million.   -- Security Pacific Bank Washington bought the Washingtonoffices of Gibraltar Savings, Seattle. Gibraltar's Floridabranches were purchased by Great Western Bank, a unit ofGreat Western Financial. The acquirers will assume depositstotaling $1.2 billion. The RTC's ultimate cost was put at$106.1 million.   -- First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, ColoradoSprings, Colo., with $281.9 million in assets, was acquiredby Western National Bank of Colorado Springs, in atransaction expected to cost the RTC $138 million.   -- Elysian Federal Savings Bank, Hoboken, N.J., with$114.3 million in assets, was sold to Pamrapo Savings Bank,Bayonne, N.J., in a deal expected to cost the RTC $33.5million.   -- Valley Federal Savings Association, McAllen, Texas,with $536 million in assets, was sold to International Bankof Commerce, Laredo, Texas, in a transaction expected to costthe RTC $210 million.   -- The RTC placed Windsor Federal Savings Association,Austin, Texas, into receivership.
