The $700 million agreement calls for Textron to manufacture wingparts at its factory in Nashville, Tenn.   British Aerospace said the contract was denominated in dollars,which would reduce its risks from further rises in the pound makingits Airbus work too costly. Most orders for civilian aircraftaround the world are denominated in dollars, and the leadingaircraft builder, Boeing Co., is based in the United States.   Textron's work on wing parts for 600 Airbus Industrie A330 andA340 airliners accounts for about 15 percent of the total Airbuswork for which British Aerospace is responsible, the company said.   British Aerospace is a partner in the four-nation AirbusIndustrie consortium, which also includes aircraft manufacturersfrom France, West Germany and Spain.   Textron will work as a ``risk sharing subcontractor'' to BritishAerospace, receiving the total amount specified in the contractonly if the full 600 aircraft are ordered from Airbus. And Textronwill meet all the start-up costs itself for the manufacture of thewing parts, British Aerospace said.   ``It means that Textron has to believe in the product as much aswe do,'' said British Aerospace spokesman Howard Berry.   Airbus Industrie currently has commitments from customers to buy145 of the new aircraft, with the A340 scheduled to enter servicein May 1992 and the A330 in September 1992.   British Aerospace said it was negotiating several otherdollar-denominated contracts to further reduce its currencyexposure.   British Aerospace announced in March that it had a pre-tax lossof 159 million pounds last year after making a 320 million poundprovision for expected future losses on civilian aircraftproduction. A pound is now worth about $1.84.</TEXT></DOC>
