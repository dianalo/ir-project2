As the atomic number within the lanthanide series increases, thetransformation temperature tends to increase as well. This tendency isstrongly related to the spacing of the nearest-neighbor oxygen atomsand is successfully interpreted in terms of the repulsion energy betweenthem on the basis of a simple order-disorder transformation model proposedby Kubo et al. (1987). 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
