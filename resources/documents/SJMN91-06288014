PETE WILSON says he vetoed the gay rights bill because it would be aburdensome cost to California employers. Yet that same week, he signed a billrequiring companies to give employees four months off every two years to carefor dependent family members. Jobs must be held open four months unless itwould be an undue hardship on the company.;    This new law will have a farbigger impact on employers than gay rights. Whereas only about 10 percent ofemployees are gay, virtually every employee at some time will become a parentor need to care for a sick child or an aging relative.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FIRMS MUST GET READY FOR FAMILY LEAVE LAW  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Viewpoints; Rita Risser is a Santa Cruz consultant who provides managementtraining seminars on employment law issues for business and industry.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The new law essentially duplicates California's protections for women whoare disabled by pregnancy and childbirth. Now mother and father will be ableto take four months off to bond with the child, arrange for day care orrecover from sleep deprivation.;   One anomaly created by this law: Employersare not required to give employees four months off for their own disabilities(other than pregnancy). Even if employees are injured at work, they are notentitled to any time off with their jobs guaranteed when they return.;   Theleave law goes into effect Jan. 1. It applies to every company with 50 or moreemployees doing business in California. The leave is not required to be paid.;  The four-month leave cannot be used in addition to vacation or personal timetaken off already. Thus, if an employee takes a two-week vacation and thenrequests family leave, the maximum amount of time available would be 14 weeks.Compensatory time off for overtime worked cannot be counted against thefour-month leave time.;   The legislation raises many unanswered questions.What is the minimum amount of leave that can be taken? Is the employeeentitled to take off one day to solve a child-care crisis? Can an employeedemand to take a half-time leave, working just four hours a day?;   The lawdoesn't require individuals to be married to take time off for a child'sbirth. A doctor's certificate can be required as proof of disability. Willemployers also be allowed to require copies of birth certificates to proveparenthood?;   Another issue relates to sexual orientation discrimination. Arelesbians covered for the birth of a child by their partners? Are gay men whoadopt a child allowed to take leave? In San Francisco and other cities thathave gay rights ordinances, gay and lesbian couples should be treated the sameas others. But the prudent employer should treat everyone equally.;  Regulations will be adopted by the California Department of Fair Employmentand Housing. Until then, companies should take these steps:;   (check) Locateall leave and benefit policies that may be affected, including maternity,medical and disability leaves, disability benefits and absenteeism. Find andamend all materials that contain those policies, including employee handbooks,policy and procedures manuals, and recruitment packages.;   (check) Thinkabout how you could fill various positions for four-month stretches. Shouldyou cross-train employees to do each other's jobs? Can you begin identifyingcontractors and consultants who are capable short-term replacements? Canflexible schedules be designed for employees who really need reduced workschedules rather than a leave?;   (check) Educate managers about the new lawand new company policies.;   (check) Educate employees about theirresponsibilities to the company. For example, if the other parent does notwork outside the home, the employee can be denied the leave.;   (check)Identify in advance those jobs that can't be kept open for four months. Ifthere are such crucial jobs, let the employees know now so they can look forwork elsewhere if they wish.;   In determining how crucial a job is, I like touse the CEO test: If your chief executive's spouse were fatally ill, and he orshe wanted time off, would the company hold that job open? Probably yes. Isthis other job more important than CEO? Probably not. Therefore, you must holdopen the other job because it shouldn't create an undue hardship on thecompany. (People on leave are not exempt from layoffs if their position isbeing eliminated in a legitimate reduction of force. But people on leave can'tbe picked for layoffs solely because they are on leave.);   Actually, the lawspecifically exempts the highest-paid employees. So if your company wanted tofill the CEO's job, it could.;   The family leave law will dramatically changethe way employees are treated. And although California is in the forefront, itprobably will not be alone for long. Congress is considering a leave lawrequiring up to 12 weeks off. If it becomes law (and it passed the Senate withenough votes to override President Bush's threatened veto), Californiaemployers still would be required to give 16 weeks off.;   Some employerswonder if the United States will be at a competitive disadvantage as a resultof this and other employment laws. We need only look to the strong economy ofGermany, which gives up to one year off for family leave, to see that acountry can value employees as human beings and still retain its competitiveedge.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RITA RISSER  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911014  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  888  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 14, 199100288014,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
