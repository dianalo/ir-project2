STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev washeralding improved East-West relations in Bonn recently, EastGermany was exhorting its young people to defend socialism ``withweapons'' if necessary.   East Germany's aging leadership is growing increasingly uneasyover the momentum of reforms in other Warsaw Pact countries, andover the warming of relations between the Soviet Union and WestGermany.   ``East Germany's leaders aren't having a very good time rightnow,'' said Heinz Timmermann, a foreign affairs expert at Cologne'sInstitute for Eastern European and International Studies.   ``Everywhere they look there are changes going on that threatenthem,'' Timmermann said, referring to political and economic reformsin the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.   East Germany's state media gave scant attention to Gorbachev'sJune visit to West Germany, where he was enthusiastically receivedby citizens.   Better relations between Bonn and Moscow mean more headaches forEast Berlin, which has suffered for years from an identity crisis inthe shadow of its prosperous western neighbor.   Gorbachev's popularity in East Germany also has posed increasingproblems as public dissatisfaction mounts over the lack of reformsin the nation.   Many East Germans look to Gorbachev in the hope that he can helpbring change to their rigidly controlled society.   But East Berlin, once the Kremlin's staunchest ideological ally,has begun a campaign to reinforce its orthodox communist views andhas vehemently attacked advocates of change at home and abroad.   While Gorbachev was being feted in Bonn and Beijing, MargotHonecker, East Germany's education minister and the wife of theparty Erich Honecker, urged the nation's youth to be prepared tofight for socialism.   ``This is a time of struggle,'' Mrs. Honecker told delegatesattending an education congress in East Berlin. ``The times need ageneration of young people who are willing to struggle to defendsocialism ... with weapons in their hands if necessary.''   East German leaders promptly defended China's June 3-4 crackdownon the pro-democracy movement, saying violence was necessary to stopa ``counterrevolutionary overthrow of people's power in China.''   Security forces beat and detained demonstrators who tried todeliver petitions to the Chinese Embassy in East Berlin to protestthe crackdown.   In a rare public attack against a fellow Warsaw Pact nation, EastGerman officials denounced political and economic reforms in Hungary.   Joachim Herrmann, a member of the Communist Party's policy-makingCentral Committee, said, ``The developments in Hungary fill us withgreat concern.''   ``Under the flag of `renewing socialism,' forces are at work thatstrive for the removal of socialism,'' Herrmann said.   Hungary's Communist Party and opposition groups have agreed tohold multiparty elections by next summer, and the country hasembarked on bold economic reforms, including more cooperation withthe West.   East Berlin is equally troubled by political developments inPoland. State media have largely ignored Solidarity's stunningvictories last month over Communist candidates.   The ruling Politburo also has stepped up its campaign againstwould-be reformers in the East German party's ranks.   In one of the sharpest official rebukes in a decade, thePolitburo denounced Dresden's party leadership as ``ineffective incontrolling hostile bourgeois activities.''   Dresden's party chief, Hans Modrow, is considered sympathetic toGorbachev's program of economic reforms and glasnost.   There also are signs the East German government fears that publicdissatisfaction over the lack of changes in its society could leadto violent street protests.   West Berlin's Morgenpost newspaper reported on June 30 that EastGermany had nearly doubled the strength of its elite riot controlforce.   Travel restrictions, long in force for visits to the West, alsoare being imposed for trips to Poland and Hungary.   West German news reports have said Hungary is increasinglyreluctant to extradite East Germans if they flee to Austria. TheHungarians have begun dismantling some border barriers with Austria,making it easier for East Germans to flee to the West than over theheavily fortified border between East Germany and West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
