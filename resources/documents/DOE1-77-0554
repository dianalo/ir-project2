Onthe contrary, the oxidizer gas is flown through from one side of thecell body towards the opposite side, and the fuel gas is flown from thecenter of the cell body towards the above-mentioned two sides; thus theflow is counter-current on one side of the cell body, and is parallelcurrent on the other side, current density is made maximum at the centerof the cell body and gradually reduces towards the peripheral parts.Temperature distribution is proportional to the current density.
