To evaluate the consequences of such actions, many different criteriahave to be taken into account such as the radiological risk, nutritionaland environmental criteria, current technical intervention levels, economiccosts and public reaction. Under the guidance of the Institute of Automationand Operations Research at the University of Fribourg a Multi-Criteria-Analysis(MCA) approach, based on the most recent developments in decision theory,is being elaborated. MCA requires input from a suite of sub-models combinedwith basic input data. For the radiological impact model the German codeECOSYS will be adapted for Swiss conditions. Furthermore, input dataon the effect of food processing on radionuclide content of foodstuffsand consumption habits are needed. MCA thus allows the consequences ofdifferent countermeasures to be assessed in relation to the differentgoverning criteria. In order to allow efficient use of this techniqueit shall be implemented as a user friendly computerized decision supportsystem. In this paper, an example of different countermeasures to reducethe dose from milk contaminated with I-131 resulting from a reactor accidentis given.</TEXT></DOC>
