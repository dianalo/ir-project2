The apparent contradiction illustrates how busy Shelley Duvallis these days.   During an interview, she's dressed as Bo Peep for her productionof ``Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme'' for the Disney Channel. She'salso executive producer of the new horror series for the Showtimepay television network.   ``Nightmare Classics'' premieres Saturday with ``Turn of theScrew,'' Henry James' Victorian suspense tale, starring Amy Irving,David Hemmings and Paul Balthazar Getty.   ``We're doing the classic stories of psychological horror ratherthan the contemporary gore,'' said Duvall. ``We're selecting thetales from Henry James, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Louis Stevenson. Wehave a low budget, so part of the selection process is findingstories from the approximate same period so we could use the samesets. There's more than one way to skin a cat.''   One show, ``The Eyes of the Panther,'' based on two stories byAmbrose Bierce, required log cabins that they haven't figured outyet how to re-use.   Other episodes are ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' and ``Carmilla.''   Duvall was on the set of her musical fantasy about the abductionof Mother Goose. The house had a huge goose head on the roof andnext to it was the house belonging to the Old Woman Who Lived in aShoe. Overhead, huge tufts of cotton clouds were suspended from theblue cloth sky.   As Bo Peep, she was dressed in a long red wig, a broad-brimmedhat, a frilly tutu, red-and-white stripped stockings and platformwedgies. Her dog, Gizmo, a mixture of Pomeranian and cairn terrierwith a recent short haircut, was at her feet.   The fairy tale musical also stars Garry Shandling and Teri Garras Jack and Jill, Howie Mandell as Humpty Dumpty, Cyndi Lauper andWoody Harrelson as Mary and her lamb, Harry Anderson as PeterPiper, Little Richard as Ole King Cole, Art Garfunkel as thebartender at Georgie Porgie's Lounge and Deborah Harry as the OldWoman Who Lived in a Shoe, Jean Stapleton as Mother Goose and DanGilroy as her son Gordon Goose.   ``Dan's never had any experience, but he's a natural actor,''she said. ``Everybody wanted me to find someone more experienced,but I stuck to my guns. The only mistake I made was when I didn'tgo with my instincts. Bob Altman found me in Houston and I had noexperience. He took a chance on me.''   In all, Duvall has starred in seven Robert Altman movies,including a role as Olive Oyl in ``Popeye.'' She's produced twoother series for Showtime. Her first was ``Faerie Tale Theatre''and the second was ``Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales and Legends.'' Herlongtime collaborator is Bridget Terry, who's producing ``Dinner atEight,'' starring Lauren Bacall, Marsha Mason and Charles Durning,for Turner Network Television.   Actually, the distance between fairy tales and horror stories isquite short.   ``Fairy tales can be very scary,'' said Duvall. ``The Grimmtales particularly can be grim. Many of them were thinly disguisedpolitical commentary. When I selected the stories for `Faerie TaleTheatre' I had to be very careful.''   Duvall produced 26 episodes of ``Faerie Tale Theatre,'' whichare now in syndication and are available on video cassette. Shefeels there is a much wider audience for the stories since onlyabout six million people saw them on Showtime.   She has also stopped production of ``Tall Tales,'' which isgoing into syndication and videos.   ``When I pitched `Nightmare Classics' I had the choice of doingthat or continuing with `Tall Tales,''' she said. ``I chose tostart the new series. I had a body of work with `Tall Tales' that Icould take and sell elsewhere.''   Duvall said she enjoys running her own production company andwants to produce all forms of entertainment. She's much too busynow getting her company started, but said she'd like to try herhand at directing, too.</TEXT><TEXT>      Elsewhere in television:   PIONEER WOMEN _ Pioneer Women in Film has begun production of avideo history with Fay Wray as the first subject.
