When the final ruleis published, this definition will cross-reference sections of the EARconcerning supercomputers.The term ``supercomputer'' refers to advanced architecture, very high speed,computer systems that can solve highly complex problems in strategicallyrelevant time frames. Because of their high-speed problem solving capabilities,supercomputers have unique applications in a variety of critical militaryareas. The United States and certain of its Western allies have a commandingedge in supercomputer technology over the Soviet Union and its allies.This technological edge translates into a specific strategic military advantage.If this technological edge were eroded by diversion of a supercomputersystem to the Soviet Bloc, our national security could be seriously jeopardized.Accordingly, the Bureau of Export Administration licenses the export ofa supercomputer only when it is satisfied that special security safeguards_coveringsecurity during shipment, physical security of the system, and computationalaccess security_are in place and will be adhered to.Congress has recognized the strategic importance of this technology, andhas exempted supercomputers from certain reexport control liberalizationsotherwise mandated by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.The supercomputer definition proposed in this rule contains specific technicalguidelines for measuring a computer's performance. It also includes a thresholdperformance level above which a computer would be considered a ``supercomputer''for export control purposes. This definition, of course, will be subjectto periodic review as this technology advances.In addition to establishing a performance threshold for ``supercomputers'',Commerce is exploring the possibility of streamlining the licensing processfor supercomputers, while maintaining the level of control that this advancedtechnology warrants. One possible approach would be to focus on the ultimatedestination of the supercomputer and differentiate among imports by specificgroups of countries. For example, security safeguards could vary accordingto whether or not the ultimate destination is a COCOM/5(k) country.The Commerce Department will consider public comments that address thesupercomputer definition, the threshold level of performance, and the supercomputerlicensing process, including comments concerning the linkage between securitysafeguards and the importing country. Publication of a final rule willfollow after consultations with appropriate U.S. allies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements and Invitation to Comment</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. This rule does not contain a collection of information subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Because this rule is being issuedin proposed form, this rule complies with section 13(b) of the Export AdministrationAct. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemakingand an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations,this rule is issued in proposed form and comments will be considered inthe development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encouragesInterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views.The period for submission of comments will close January 19, 1989. TheDepartment will consider all comments received before the close of thecomment period in developing final regulations. Comments received afterthe end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but theirconsideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept publiccomments accompanied by a request that part or all of the material be treatedconfidentially because of its business proprietary nature or for any otherreason. The Department will return such comments and materials to the personsubmitting the comments and will not consider them in the development offinal regulations. All public comments on these regulations will be a matterof public record and will be available for public inspection and copying.In the interest of accuracy and completeness, the Department requires commentsin written form. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, whichwill also be matter of public record and will be available for public reviewand copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Governmentor foreign governments will not be made available for public inspection. The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4886, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, including writtenpublic comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications,may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published inPart 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Information aboutthe inspection and copying of records at the facility may be obtained fromMargaret Cornejo, Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of InformationOfficer, at the above address or by calling (202) 377-2593.  5. This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 776  </ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
