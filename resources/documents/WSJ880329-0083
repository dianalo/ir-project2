Levine insider-trading scandal, from employment or involvement with any stock exchange member firm.    In addition, a source close to the case said a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of Mr. Campbell is actively continuing.    The Big Board said Mr. Campbell, whose trading and ties to Mr. Levine were the subject of a Wall Street Journal front-page profile last year, failed to comply with Big Board requests to appear and testify concerning the possibility that he may have traded stocks &quot;based on material, non-public information.&quot;    The Big Board said Mr. Campbell will be barred from member-firm activity until he complies with its requests.    Last year's Journal article reported that, according to people familiar with Mr. Campbell's activities and other sources, Mr. Campbell traded in some of the same securities as Dennis Levine, and may have knowingly traded on inside information.    Mr. Campbell is a former Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. stockbroker who handled trading for the Bahamas branch of Bank Leu International Ltd., the bank Mr. Levine used to trade stocks on inside information. Mr. Levine, a former investment banker, is serving a two-year sentence in federal prison after pleading guilty to four felony counts related to his trading on nonpublic information about corporate takeovers.    As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission called Mr. Campbell in for questioning last June. Mr. Campbell invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer the SEC's questions.    Mr. Campbell joined Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. as a stockbroker after leaving Merrill Lynch, and resigned under pressure from Smith Barney on the day he refused to answer the SEC's questions.    A spokesman for the SEC said that, as a matter of policy, he couldn't comment on any possible investigation relating to Mr. Campbell. Barry Fallick, an attorney for Mr. Campbell, said, &quot;Based on advice of counsel Mr. Campbell has chosen not to appear (before the exchange) until any other investigations are concluded.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
