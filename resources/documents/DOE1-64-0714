Theauthors used the presence of glucose to calculate the amount of celluloseavailable for hydrolysis and the reaction rate of hydrolysis, thus providinga measure of the effectiveness of pretreatment processes. Of the threepretreatment processes tested, rapid streaming for 1 min was more effectivethan either wet oxidation or autohydrolysis. Solvent extraction of thepretreated woods decreased the effectiveness of cellulase hydrolysis.</TEXT></DOC>
