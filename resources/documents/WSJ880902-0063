(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Like tiny beacons at night, alligators' eyes reflect a brilliant red when struck by a beam of light.    So flashlights, along with such items as harpoons and sharpened knives, were among the equipment being checked yesterday as more than 200 hunters, many of them novices, waited for the sunset opening of the first statewide gator hunt in 26 years.    &quot;It's time to get some gators,&quot; John Swindle, 34 years old, of Clewiston, on the south shore of Lake Okeechobee, said before the hunt began. &quot;I'm not talking much about it, though. I don't want anybody following me out there.&quot;    With gator hides selling for $42 a foot and meat running to $6 a pound, profits are as much on the minds of the state-selected hunters as adventure. The state planned the 30-day hunt season to help control the population of the once-endangered alligator.    &quot;The money is the big factor,&quot; said Rodney Crawford, a 19-year-old cook from Lake Worth, who will seek gators with his father on Lake George in Central Florida.    Hunters can legally use only harpoons, grappling hooks or bows and tethered arrows to bag the animals. Guns aren't allowed, because gators often sink after being shot.    So many of the novice hunters -- which include a New York City free-lance writer, a housewife and a professional wrestling announcer -- have hired veteran trappers in the quest to bag their limit of 15 gators. The deals worked out are as varied as the participants.    Tom Stice, of the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, said a cross-section of hunters was sought to expand interest in alligators.    &quot;We want you and your brother and your next-door neighbor,&quot; said Mr. Stice. &quot;We want to develop a vested interest in the species through public interest.&quot;    The 238 hunters, selected from about 5,000 applications, attended a six-hour state-sponsored training session and signed liability waivers.    For wildlife officials, the need for the hunt signifies success in a nearly 20-year effort to preserve the Florida gator.    Since federal anti-poaching methods were adopted in 1970, the gator population in Florida has about doubled to an estimated one million. The hunt will be isolated to 28 districts where the alligator population is extraordinarily high.    &quot;People are getting gator phobia,&quot; said Lee Kramer of Delray Beach, who captures nuisance alligators for the state. &quot;I got a call the other day in Boca (Raton) and it turned out to be an inflatable pool alligator that blew into a ditch.&quot;    Allan Woodward, of the game commission, theorized that the alligator population was not as decimated as previously thought during the height of poaching in the 1960s.    &quot;They've really surprised us,&quot; he said. &quot;They're a pretty hardy animal.&quot;    Mr. Stice estimated the trappers will capture 65% to 70% of the possible maximum of 3,450.    Meanwhile, state officials planned to watch for poachers or permit-holders using illegal weapons or bagging gators below the four-foot minimum length. A game commission spokesman said most gator-related penalties carry a maximum $500 fine and 60 days in jail.    The state issued last-minute regulations requiring that a flap be cut in the hides in order for them to be validated. The rule is intended to block the sale of skins not taken in the hunt.    &quot;We wanted a way to stop anyone who may have stockpiled hides and will try to pass them off as from the hunt,&quot; said state biologist David Dennis.    Gator hunters have become instant celebrities.    &quot;I've never gotten so much attention,&quot; said Everglades hunter Evelyn Shealy, postmaster at tiny Ochopee, which boasts the smallest post office building in the nation. &quot;But after it all dies down we'll be the ones with gator meat in our freezers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
