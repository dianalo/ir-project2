Unit---By Matthew WinklerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WNEWS SHE AXP </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., will join Boston Co., a Shearson unit, as its chief economist. In addition, Mr. Sinai was named chairman and chief executive officer of Boston Co. Economic Advisors, a new subsidiary, Shearson said.    Mr. Sinai, 48 years old and one of the most prominent economists on Wall Street, will be succeeded at Shearson by Robert J. Barbera, the 35-year-old chief economist at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. The changes, which become effective Jan. 5, were initiated after Shearson agreed to acquire Hutton earlier this month, Shearson President Jeffrey Lane said.    &quot;This is a grand slam home run for us -- we would have had a problem with two A-pluses,&quot; Mr. Lane said, explaining Shearson's move to accommodate Messrs. Barbera and Sinai. &quot;Now Bob gets what he wants, Allen gets what he wants and we get what we need.&quot;    Mr. Sinai, who lives with his family in Lexington, Mass., but has worked the past five years in Shearson's Manhattan headquarters, dismissed some rivals' assertions that the move was a step down for him. &quot;I'm ecstatic,&quot; he said. &quot;Starting a new venture is something I've wanted to do for some time, in addition to the personal aspect&quot; of living in Boston.    Mr. Sinai said he &quot;took a cut in pay because this (new job) is an entrepreneurial affair&quot; and because he will have a chance to earn additional income through his stake in Boston Co.'s new advisory unit. &quot;There's a lot of upside in this,&quot; he said. Boston Co. manages more than $28 billion for clients and is an administrator for more than $100 billion, according to Mr. Lane.    Mr. Barbera couldn't immediately be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
