SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American military personnel stationed overseaswill be counted in the 1990 census, but the House on Tuesdayblocked a related move to bar the counting of illegal aliens.   The decision to include military personnel in the count wasannounced by the Commerce Department at the start of a hearing on abill to require the action.   According to Tuesday's announcement, the Census Bureau will workwith the Pentagon to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million militaryand civilian Defense Department workers overseas.   At the same time the sometimes emotional debate over leaving outundocumented aliens was under way both in committee and on theHouse floor, where Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., failed in an effort toattach the ban to an appropriations measure.   His amendment was offered to a $5.8 billion appropriation billfor running the State, Justice, and Commerce Departments next year,including $800 million for carrying out the 1990 census. The billwas approved by a vote of 258 to 165, and sent to the Senate.   The dispute cuts close to home for the 435 House members, sincethe Census count will be used to redistribute House seats among thestates. States which have grown in population will get more seats,others will lose them.   Many Northern states, already facing losses because ofpopulation shifts to the South and West, fear additional gains bythe Sun Belt states and large urban centers because of thesettlement of illegal aliens in those areas.   Hence, Ridge's amendment, rejected after extensive parliamentarymaneuvering.   Opponents pointed out that the Constitution specificallyrequires House seats to be apportioned based on all the ``persons''residing in a state.   ``Every Census since the Constitution was created has countedall residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.   ``Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in theCensus, responded Ridge.   The count, scheduled for April 1, 1990, will cost $4 billion,said Ridge, asserting that the Census Bureau has the money toidentify and separate out illegal aliens, but doesn't want to.   Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., contended that at the time theConstitution was written there were no illegal aliens, all newarrivals were welcome.   Rep. Marvyn Dymally, D-Calif., countered that there have alwaysbeen undocumenmted aliens in this country. The difference is thatin the early days they came from Europe.   The debate, Dymally said, is really over the fact thatpopulation shifts will lead House seats to Southern and Westernstates and that undocumented aliens are being blamed.   ``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go downto the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose aseat,'' said Dymally.   Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., however, said he cannot understandwhy illegal aliens should be allowed to dilute the representationof U.S. citizens.   Counting illegal aliens ``is not fair. It may be Constitutional,but it's just not right,'' said Valentine.   ``The question is how are we going to identify those that arehere illegally that are not entitled to representation in thisbody,'' said Rep. James Slattery, D-Kan. ``That will be tough to do... the least we should so is to make that extraordinary effort.''   ``You're now asking the Bureau of the Census to be judge andjury in determining who should be counted,'' responded Rep. RobertGarcia, D-N.Y.   The questions of counting undocumented aliens and overseasmilitary personnal have been tied together in many debates, withthe question raised of the fairness of including illegal aliens butnot American servicemen and servicewomen in the figures used forapportionment.   In the past, service members overseas generally have not beenincluded in census counts used to apportion seats in the House ofRepresentatives.   That is because census officials considered it impossible todetermine accurately in which state an individual should becounted. Many military people move often.   The Census Bureau said it will investigate ways to make thatjudgment in the 1990 census. Possibilities include listing aservice person's last state of residence for more than six months,or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country.   Census officials have generally opposed any attempt to deleteillegal aliens, contending that they have no method of determiningwho is in the country legally. Asking people about their statuswould likely result in people lying or refusing to participate inthe count, officials say, resulting in a potential undercount ofresidents in many areas.</TEXT></DOC>
