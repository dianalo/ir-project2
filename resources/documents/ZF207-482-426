 The company should analyzethe problem that the microcomputer is supposed to solve.andP;  It mayvery well be that the problem is not one that a computer can helpstraighten out.andP;  The other method is to purchase the microcomputerand wait to see if it justifies itself.andP;  If there are no obviousbenefits from its use, move it somewhere else in the company orget rid of it entirely.andP;  The third method is to look at computerpurchases as simply the cost of doing business and not somethingthat needs to be justified.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MicrocomputersCompaniesManagementEquipment AcquisitionHardware Selection.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Virtually every company, at one time or another, struggles with the issue ofjustifying its investment in PCs.andP;  It isn't always easy for the top brass ofthe company to fund desktop technology on faith alone.andM;In talking with some microcomputer managers recently, I found companypolicies range from the ridiculous -- having to justify every single PC -- tothe utterly ridiculous -- an open (unaudited) checkbook.andP;  It seems thatnobody is happy with this arrangement.andP;  So some of us started talking aboutnew ideas.andP;  What emerged were a few methods worth sharing:andM;Method No.andP;  1: If you can't quantify the benefit, then quantify the problem.andO;Face it: It's sometimes hard to see the installation of a microcomputer asthe solution to some business problem.andP;  After all, the computer by itselfgenerally doesn't solve the problem.andM;An example?andP;  How about a customer-service support desk.andM;If the workers are responsible for dealing with $10 million of business, butcan't tell where orders are, then the company has a problem.andP;  Installing amicrocomputer linked to the corporate database won't make the truck driverdrive any faster, but it will give Olive Order Desk Worker a chance to trackthings down and be responsive.andP;  This, of course, might have something to dowith customer's motivation to order our products again.andM;So the PC is one of the tools, but not the only tool, needed.andP;  If we believewe can put a system together that will protect just one-half of 1 percent ofour orders, we are talking about $50,000.andP;  You'd be hard-pressed to spendhalf of that if you bought Olive a 33MHz 386 PC, 1 gigabyte of disk and agold-plated modem.andM;Method No.andP;  2: Buy now, justify later.andP;  Some people feel you can relax strictprocurement rules if you track the results.andP;  You probably don't know if a PCwill provide a significant benefit to the productivity of Johnny or Susieuntil they've had a chance to learn and use some of its tools.andM;That's why some companies are considering a use-it-or-lose-it policy.andP;  Theygive a PC to just about anyone who asks, then monitor usage.andP;  If the userdoesn't show up on the log-in records for a certain period of time, thecomputer is repossessed.andM;Those who do show up on the logs are asked periodically to report whatbenefits they are getting.andP;  If they come up with some good benefits, theykeep the computer.andP;  If they haven't got much more than Flight Simulator orfishes from Aqua-EGA going, the computer goes off to the happy huntinggrounds in search of a more worthwhile user.andM;Method No.andP;  3: Stop trying to justify PCs.andP;  Just consider them a cost ofdoing business.andP;  Some people figure it's an expense -- standard equipment --like office furniture or a telephone.andM;Truthfully, these companies have a point.andP;  A properly installed and equippedcorporate network provides workers with such basic tools (calendars, E-mail,spreadsheets, word processors, file systems and so on) that many workerswould rather give up their chair and sit on the floor than give up their PCor network connection.andP;  So now some companies say, &quot;Let's forget the smallstuff and stop trying to keep score.&quot;andM;Do these companies get burned?andP;  Probably not.andP;  The computer has gotten to besuch an important part of white-collar jobs that if people don't use it, theywon't be around for long.andP;  They just won't be able to compete.andM;Which method is right for you and your company?andP;  That depends more on theexecutive management than it does on the microcomputer manager.andP;  What countsis their comfort level.andM;Chances are, however, that if you're still going to committee over each PCpurchase, you're wasting everyone's time.andP;  You just might want to try one ofthese methods.andM;----------Cheryl Currid manages the department responsible for applying informationtechnology at a major Fortune 500 company.andP;  The opinions she expresses areher own.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
