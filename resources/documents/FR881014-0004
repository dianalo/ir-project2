Sailing in a column underthe Golden Gate Bridge at approximately 10:30 a.m. P.D.T., the vesselswill be spaced approximately 500 yards apart and will proceed at about10 knots. The parade will sail along the San Francisco waterfront in theEastbound San Francisco Bay Traffic Lane, to a location near the San Francisco-OaklandBay Bridge where the ships will disperse to their respective moorings.A moving Safety Zone surrounding the column of vessels will ensure unobstructedwaters for safe navigation. An aerial demonstration by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels will begin after theship parade clears the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. In preparationfor this demonstration, the Blue Angels will conduct a familiarizationflight at 12:00 Noon P.D.T. on October 13, 1988, and a practice flightat 12:00 Noon on October 14, 1988. Safety Zones on all three days willcover the Blue Angels flight line from Fort Point to Blossom Rock. Thisclear area enables two Coast Guard vessels to serve as reference pointsalong the flight line for the aircraft pilots. Furthermore, the extremelylow altitude passes require vessels to keep clear for the safety of theaircraft, vessels, and persons onboard.  The Safety Zone for the Blue Angels' demonstrations will restrict vesselsaccess to some marinas and commercial docks. The short length and minimalsize of the Safety Zone will minimize any inconvenience.  Vessels will not be authorized to enter the established Safety Zone areasunless authorized by the Captain of the Port. Fleetweek '88 activitiesare expected to attract a sizable fleet of vessels, and large vessel operatorswith transits near Fleetweek '88 activities are encouraged to plan suchtransits well before or after the Safety Zones are in effect.
