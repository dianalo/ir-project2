Each program has its own complex rules. Bonuses come and go. Finding the plan that yields the most points for a trip from Atlanta to Seattle -- including bonuses for hotels and car rentals -- resembles an exam question from a sadistic math teacher.    Computer software created this tangle, by giving airlines new-found flexibility. Now, a handful of tiny companies are selling inexpensive personal-computer software to help frequent fliers fight back.    &quot;It really helps me out,&quot; says Janice Konnersmann, a secretary at Krupp/James Insurance in Memphis, Tenn., who uses a program called Freequent Flyer, from OMT Group of Sunnyvale, Calif. &quot;My boss travels all the time, and he's in all the frequent-flier programs,&quot; she says.    She used to keep &quot;a big huge notebook&quot; with a section for each airline and hotel program to which her boss belongs. Before each trip, she would check the latest brochure from each program. &quot;But if TWA was offering a 50% bonus to a certain city, I probably wouldn't have known,&quot; she says. Now, all the information is on her personal computer.    But some skeptics argue that because airlines fiddle constantly with their frequent-flier programs, the information in such software rapidly grows stale. &quot;There aren't any (programs) that are reliable because the rules change so fast,&quot; says William Brancatelli, a contributing editor at Frequent Flyer magazine. Some software makers, however, say they address this problem by offering periodic updates.    Software for frequent fliers generally is of two kinds. One is primarily for record keeping-computerized logs used to verify airline statements. More sophisticated programs offer information on the frequentflier programs, such as details of special offers. Some combine both elements.    FliteCalc, from JetStream International of Kaysville, Utah, is typical of the simple record-keeping packages. The $40 product knows the distance between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. After a trip, the traveler types in the airports to which he has flown, and the program keeps a log of points earned -- more or less. The program, however, isn't smart enough to know that Eastern Airlines gives a minimum of 1,000 miles for all flights, so it logs a trip on the Boston-New York shuttle as only 184 points.    FlighTrak, sold for $40 by FlighTrak Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., is a bit smarter: It records the shuttle flight correctly as 1,000 points. It also offers an easy way to calculate how many more miles a traveler earns by flying, say, from Boston to San Francisco by changing planes in Atlanta instead of in Chicago. (Answer: 374.)    ATS, a $50 record-keeping product sold by Software Dynamics Inc. of Canoga Park, Calif., adds a listing of the best award a traveler currently qualifies for in each of his or her programs.    All this computerized record keeping may be akin to balancing a checkbook on a personal computer: It sounds good, but perhaps takes more time than it's worth. &quot;I like the idea, but the overhead of keeping track of my mileage is just too high,&quot; says Thomas Martin, president of a Hackensack, N.J., computer-leasing company, who owns a package but rarely uses it. &quot;Maybe if I had time to teach a secretary to do it, or if I was interested in playing with a PC myself. . . .&quot;    Other, more sophisticated packages aren't so useful for record keeping, but try to provide up-to-date information on airline programs. Bonus Wizard, from MicroSmart Software in Stamford, Conn., knows what hotels and car-rental companies cooperate with which airline. It adds bonus points to its log where deserved, but only if the traveler has followed the airline's rules. &quot;Did you secure a validation sticker from Marriott?&quot; it asks. Type yes, and it responds, &quot;Good job! You're headed for a free vacation.&quot; Type no, and it offers to write a letter to Marriott.    One of Bonus Wizard's most popular features: It will automatically print a terse letter -- and address the envelope -- if a frequent flier discovers he hasn't been credited for a certain flight.    Freequent Flyer tells a Denver-bound traveler that Continental offers bonuses on all early morning flights out of Denver this month and that United gives extra points for flights to Burbank, Calif., and Chicago. And if a Delta frequent flier is looking for a hotel in Dallas that will boost his tally, the program lists four choices.    Of course, such software is only as good as the timeliness of its information. Both Freequent Flyer and Bonus Wizard offer regular updates -- for a price. Bonus Wizard, which costs $30, will trade an old version for an updated one for $15, but sends its customers a free newsletter every few months that lists major changes. Freequent Flyer costs $40, including three monthly updates. After that, the company charges $80 a year for monthly updates, or $50 a year for quarterly updates.    Randy Peterson, who publishes a newsletter for frequent fliers from Colorado Springs, Colo., recently acquired the rights to offer Freequent Flyer on an electronic bulletin board, and says he plans to do so later this year.    &quot;You don't need to own a computer to take full advantage of these programs,&quot; Mr. Peterson adds. &quot;Most of the airline clubs now have personal computers available for use by members&quot; in airport lounges. </TEXT></DOC>
