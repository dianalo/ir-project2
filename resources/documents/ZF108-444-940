(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Company-by-Company PreviewandM;Ad-Hoc GraphicsandM;Hall 6-2, D03 (CAI Systems)andM;Ad-Hoc Graphics was formed two years ago to sell and support systems forproducing desktop color.andP;  When it couldn't find existing packages that weregood enough, it negotiated with Cambridge Computer Graphics, of Cambridge,England, to take over the source code for a desktop color product Cambridgehad decided not to develop further.andP;  The first product, called Finalia-8, wascompleted last June.andP;  It allows 256-color images to be modified, combinedwith text and vectors and separated.andP;  It Is in use in the CAD and low-enddesktop color markets, primarily in Europe.andM;ProductsandM;Ad-Hoc will demonstrate a completely new product, Finalia-32, which wasintroduced at the recent Hannover Fair on the stand of its Germandistributor, CAI Systems, which also will provide space for it at Drupa.andP;  Itruns on a PC.andP;  Ad-Hoc Graphics says it is capable of creating full 32-bitcolor, duotone or monochrome images combined with text, line art or CAD filesin HPGL format, with images and pages up to A3 size (approximately 11&quot; x17&quot;).andM;Finalia-32 supports input from flatbed or slide scanners, files in Targa ofGIF format, and Cambridge Computer Graphics' Artisan package.andP;  It outputsfull-page separations in PostScript format.andP;  It stores 24-bit data on diskand creates an 8-bit file for screen preview, which can be modified bychanging the RGB, CYMK or HSL values.andP;  It also supports undercolor removaland some other modifications.andM;Modified images can be exported into PageMaker or Corel Draw for full-pagemake-up and then returned to Finalia-32 for further modification (pagerotation, screen angle setting, etc.) and then separation and output.andM;AdventandM;Halls 7, B16 (Monotype) and 6, C09 (IBM))andM;The British company advent developed a page composition program called 3B2that runs on top of MS-DOS in a proprietary windowing environment on a PC.andO;It also will run under OS/2 and on a DEC VaxStation under VMS, as well as onan Apollo workstation.andP;  It contains built-in drawing and chartingcapabilities and can set type along any path.andP;  Because 3B2 uses Monotypeoutline fonts on the screen, rather than bitmaps, the user can freely scaleand rotate characters.andP;  It can be operated interactively or from stylespecifications.andM;ProductsandM;On the Monotype stand, Advent and MonoText will show the &quot;3B2-TextDataTypographer Extension&quot; with provisions for high typographic quality.andP;  Amongthese are the Monotype IK Bezier &quot;Smart Fonts&quot; with old-style figures and allcaps, three-level ligatures, eight-level letterspace and word space tracking,and kerning of 3,000-6,000 pairs per font.andP;  Also included are a predefinedmacro keyboard layout, better composition of European languages (hyphenation,exception dictionaries and accurate accent placement), math composition andclip art.andP;  MonoText 3B2 Typographer, with 20 fonts, will be priced at 2,000pounds ($3,000), not including the base 3B2 program.andM;LaserMaker, exhibiting on the IBM stand, will show progress in integrating3B2 with its LM product family to serve as a display ad terminal and aninteractive WYSIWYG workstation.andM;AesthedesandM;Hall 7, D33andM;(See Barco)andM;Agfa-Gevaert NV/CompugraphicandM;Hall 4, A34andM;Agfa is best known as a supplier of photographic consumables, chemicals andcameras to the graphic arts market.andP;  It also supplies the office automationand photocopier markets through the Agfa Office Systems Division.andP;  Agfa ownsCompugraphic, the world's largest supplier of typesetting systems, and isitself a division of Bayer, the German chemical company.andP;  Through itsCompugraphic division and its own moves in office automation andphotocopiers, Agfa is moving aggressively into the digital prepress field.andM;ProductsandM;The focus of the show for the Agfa Compugraphic Division will be color.andO;Coining the phrase &quot;Agfa Publishing Systems Environment&quot; (APSE) to cover theelectronic publishing areas it will serve, Agfa CG will introduce its&quot;ColorScape&quot; family of products to handle the emerging color market.andP;  Thisfamily includes the following new items:andM;* PIX -- a color retouching, image manipulation and separation system runningon a Sun386i workstation.andP;  It works with images scanned on the new Agfa CGACS100 scanner and outputs directly to imagesetters or to the new Catalystcomposition system.andP;  PIX works with the full resolution of scanned images.andO;It provides facilities for rotation in single-degree increments, colorcorrection, masking (auto or manually with airbrush or by drawing polygons),calibrating the screen with the scanner and proofer, UCR, GCR, dot-gaincompensation, working with two layers for each image, and many morefunctions.andP;  The screen can be zoomed up to 16 times the actual size.andP;  PIXworks with color specified in RGB, HSV, HSL, CMY or CMYK values, based on dotpercentages, densitometer values or digital values.andP;  The user interface isattractive.andP;  It supports macros for commonly used functions, an undo featurefor reverting to the last time undo was invoked, and nice use of menus,dialog boxes and image directories.andP;  Compugraphic says it expects to be ableto produce high-quality output by licensing some Hell screening patents ifnecessary or by finding its own methods.andM;* Catalyst -- a composition system with full pagination features and supportfor color, including images prepared on PIX.andP;  Catalyst runs on a SunSparcstation, follows Open Look graphical user interface specifications, anduses PostScript fonts for screen display and output.andP;  Any number of masterpages can be created and used in laying out pages.andP;  Text flows intocompartments created either with a mouse or by specifying x/y coordinates.andO;Compartments can be linked manually or automatically to flow text across pageboundaries.andP;  The screen can be split multiple times and scrolledindependently.andP;  Text attributes can run across a document, a galley of linkedcompartments, a single compartment or a &quot;local&quot; block.andP;  Text compositionquality reaches the same high standard of other Compugraphic products ofrecent years in handamp;j, kerning, tracking, etc.andM;Catalyst supports macro keys, good tabular setting, vertical justification,automatic numbering, flowing text around or inside irregular shapes and goodediting features.andP;  It accommodates spot and process colors, with chokes andspreads.andP;  Screen feedback is excellent.andP;  We anticipate a bundledhardware/software workstation price of about $35,000 in the U.S.andM;* ProSet 9800 -- a high-resolution PostScript-compatible imagesetterintroduced at the Seybold Seminars in March.andP;  It supports resolutions of1,200 and 2,400 dpi, a maximum speed of 15&quot; per minute and a declaredaccuracy of [+ or -] 1 mil.andP;  The 9800, which will replace the 9600 in the CGproduct line, uses some of the same technology as the 9600, but it providesgreater accuracy in the film transport and it uses a dual-beam writing systemto record two raster lines at a time using the same mirror.andM;* StudioSet 2000 -- a PostScript-only imagesetter based on an Adobe RIP andan Ultre recorder, designed as the company's entry-level product (targeted atthe Linotronic 200).andP;  It was shown at the recent Gutenberg and Type-Xexhibits.andM;* P5400PS printer -- a large-format (11&quot; x 17&quot;), 22-ppm, 400-dpi duplexprinter with an Adobe RIP and the ability to print spot colors in a singlepass.andP;  It provides a 2,000-sheet input tray and a duty cycle of 60,000impressions per month.andM;* ACS 100 scanner -- a flatbed color scanner supporting variable resolutionsbetween 300 dpi and 2,400 dpi, 10 bits per pixel, based on a linear,3,648-element CCD array.andP;  It scans transparent and reflective originals.andP;  Itwas previewed last fall as an OEM product at the Seybold Computer PublishingConference.andM;* Color Focus Scanners -- the addition of color capabilities to the400/800-dpi (8 bits/pixel) flatbed focus scanners.andP;  Also new for the Focus isa calibration feature that compensates for dot gain.andM;* Elecam scanning system -- a flatbed monochrome electronic camera based onthe ACS100 scanner.andP;  Features include copying, resizing, cropping, screening,descreening and manipulating images.andP;  It provides some innovative userinterface features in its Macintosh control unit.andP;  Elecam was introduced atIFRA last fall and is nearly ready for initial deliveries.andM;Agfa CG also will show the AgfaPress technical documentation system, version2.0, with a claimed 100 new features, including SGML input, a math program,multiple languages, a Bezier drawing facility, support for scanners andtabular composition.andM;Other new products will be the Agfa color film recorders, the ChromaScriptslide creator with a PostScript RIP and the AutoClick slide system supportingpresentation graphics packages.andP;  Agfa also said it would demonstrate itsfirst use of the Open Look user interface on its products on theSparcstation.andM;In addition, of course, there will be new products in the traditional Agfaline of film and related products.andM;Ajax International A/SandM;Hall 7, C35andM;Ajax International traditionally has focused on plate processing and exposerequipment.andM;ProductsandM;The firm will show a newly developed metal halide light source for buildinginto different copying equipment.andM;Alfa System PartnerandM;Hall 6, B08 (Mannesmann)andM;Serving mainly the German newspaper market, Alfa System Partner wasestablished in 1982 by some former employees of Linotype.andP;  In 1986,Mannesmann acquired a majority interest in Alfa.andP;  It will be exhibiting onthe Mannesmann Kienzle stand.andM;ProductsandM;New on the editorial PCTerminal is a WYSIWYG soft proofing function.andP;  Othereditorial features include simultaneous display of two editable files (with ahorizontal or vertical division) and calendar, table and sports informationprograms.andP;  The system administrator can revise menus, font tables, displayattributes, user privileges and dictionaries.andM;A make-up program called Layout supports creation of text-and-graphics pages.andO;Text can be imported from the PCTerminal.andP;  Areas can be defined asrectangles, polygons or arbitrary curves.andP;  After being combined in the pagelayout, these areas can still be revised separately.andM;Alfa's system has an interface that enables it to use files from standarddesktop programs.andP;  At Drupa, it will be shown linked to the Macintosh-basedMulti-Ad Creator display ad system.andM;Alfa will also be demonstrating several other products: its own ad package,which can display an ad and calculate its pricing, including applicablediscounts; scanning and enhancement of logos on its Logoworkstation; andmanagement software for medium-sized newspapers and magazines.andM;Output will be sent to a 108-pica ECRM PelBox configured with a ChelgraphRIP.andP;  Text and graphics will be combined before output using the ChelgraphGraphics Integration Module.andM;AlphatypeandM;Hall 10, G06andM;One of the oldest vendors of typesetting equipment, Alphatype has beenselling text composition systems and typesetters for three decades.andP;  For abrief recent period it was owned by Berthold, but it has since becomeindependent.andP;  It has remained a relatively small company, focusing onequipment for producing high-quality type for commercial markets.andM;ProductsandM;Alphatype will demonstrate its code-oriented, PC-based Work Station III andIV composition systems running on a Novell network and driving the company'sCRS 99000 typesetter.andP;  Work Station IV provides interactive WYSIWYGcomposition.andP;  It can be used by a customer in a remote location to see jobsas they will be output at a service bureau.andP;  Work Station III provides thesame composition program, but without the WYSIWYG display.andM;A 1,200-dpi Xerox 7650 scanner will be scanning logos and images to be mergedwith text files.andM;Also exhibited will be a single-user AlphaComposer system consisting of WorkStation III or IV composition units and a typesetter.andM;Alphatype will feature its PostScript capability, which uses an interpreterfrom Pipeline Associates driving either the CRS 99000 or the AlphaComposer.andO;The 99000 will be configured with a '386 PC for the first time.andM;AltertextandM;Hall 6, C07 (Interset)andM;Starting a service bureau in Boston, Altertext developed software forconverting data from one disk format to another.andP;  It put together ahardware/software package that it could sell to other customers and ended upgiving up its service business to concentrate on disk conversion systemsales.andP;  When disk conversion grew in popularity early in the 1980s, Altertextwas one of the key vendors serving both the graphic arts and officeautomation markets.andM;In recent years it has undergone changes in ownership and management, givingit a new company name -- Document Solutions -- although it still uses theAltertext name as well.andM;ProductsandM;Altertext, which will be using space on the Intertext stand, will demonstrateits document conversion systems, which run on standard PCs and can bepurchased as software alone or bundled with hardware.andP;  They support all disksizes and formats: 8&quot;, 5 1/4&quot; (double and quad density), and 3 1/2&quot; (Mac andPC), plus communications, with extensive user-modifiable code-conversioncapabilities.andM;Also demonstrated will be a link to the new Interset Macintosh system.andO;Altertext will be taking data from other systems and converting it tointerset's format for composition.andM;AmgrafandM;Hall 7, B30 (Penta Sytems)andM;One of the earliest developers of a composition program for the PC, Amgrafselected a version of Unix (Xenix) for its Mecca system.andP;  It was designed toproduce technical illustrations, but also provided facilities for productionof long documents, using a stylus and graphics tablet to aid in layout anddrawing.andP;  It is being handled in Europe by Shaffstall MarketingInternational.andM;ProductsandM;Amgraf will show Mecca III with its latest enhancements, many of whichstreamline the production of forms and tables with rules, boxes, etc.andO;Version 6, which will be making its first showing, includes ahigh-performance graphics controller that increases display speed by up to 10times; user-defined graduated screens and color blends shown on the screen;automatic chokes and spreads for process and spot color separations; asimplified procedure for scanning images, auto tracing them usingIllustrator, and importing them into Mecca; an automatic fraction compositioncommand; programmable cursor buttons for multi-button pucks; a &quot;timeaccounting program&quot; that keeps track of operator and job time and supplies,with additional reporting facilities; and an input/output filter for EPSF.andM;Amicus SystemsandM;Halls 7, A18E, and 4, C30 (Autologic)andM;Based in London, Amicus supplies composition systems that are sold primarilythrough Monotype.andP;  Its activities include hardware and software development.andO;Its main area of expertise is support of non-Roman languages.andM;ProductsandM;New are the Amicus Access Networked System and the PC AS-SET WYSIWYGcomposition terminal.andP;  For the Apex page make-up terminal, new software willallow text and graphics prepared on other devices on the network, includingPCs and Macintoshes, to be integrated into pages up to broadsheet size.andO;Further enhancements to Apex include the make-up of multiple pages withdifferent grid layouts, the ability to flow text from page to page, andautomatic tick marks.andM;The Access networked system combines Ethernet and Novell Netware with aspecial user interface allowing easy categorization and retrieval of workfrom the network database.andM;PC AS-SET is a composition station networked with Access and running on PCs,with a user interface compatible with the menu-driven Apex.andP;  These productswill both be shown handling English/German and Arabic/Roman work.andM;An Amicus front end also will be available on the Autologic stand, working inArabic and driving an APS-6.andM;AM InternationalandM;Hall 5, C35andM;(See Varityper)andM;Apple ComputerandM;Hall 5, C05andM;Apple Computer designs, markets and manufactures personal computers andsystems for use in business, education and the home.andP;  Apple's Macintoshseries of computers provides the hardware platform for a wide range ofpublishing systems.andP;  The Macintosh was the founding platform for desktoppublishing, a field with which Apple has been closely associated.andP;  Recentlythere has been a shift of focus from desktop publishing to multimediaapplications including desktop publishing, desktop presentations and CD-ROM.andM;ProductsandM;Apple will highlight a new product running on the Macintosh.andP;  P-INK Press isan SQL-based product taht interfaces to existing standard software.andP;  Thedeveloper, P-INK, was founded in 1987 to develop software for the newspaperand magazine makerts.andP;  Its chief product, also called P-INK, is foradvertising composition and pagination.andP;  P-INK Press is an editing programrunning on the Mac and using either LocalTalk or Ethernet with modems forlinking to remote databases.andM;The SQL file server can be either a Macintosh II or a DEC Vax, with outputfor both P-INK and P-INK Press to PostScript imagesetters.andP;  P-INK Press usesan SQL database for data management, with Quark Xpress for layout.andP;  The SQLstandard language offers the possibility of links to large databases such asSybase and Oracle.andM;The system is a basic editing package designed to encourage communicationsbetween workgroups for improved formatting, production control and datapreparation.andP;  The SQL data server manages files centrally.andM;APT (Chameleon)andM;Hall 7, B30 (Penta Systems)andM;Applied Publishing Technologies (APT) was formed to develop proofing systemsfor traditional typesetter languages (Cora, Compugraphic and Autologic),basing its products on PostScript printers.andP;  Its Chameleon software, whichruns in PCs, can reside on the same Novell netwrok as a composition system,providing sophisticated queuing and spooling functions.andP;  It also can beoperated remotely to produce proof output at a customer's site or at a branchoffice.andM;ProductsandM;The latest additions to Chameleon, which were demonstrated at the recentType-X show (see our next issue), are:andM;* The ability to proof colored output on a monochrome printer by assigningother attributes (tints, patterns, etc.) to various colors.andM;* Facilities for storing fonts on the printer's hard disk to avoid having todownload them on the fly when they are used.andM;* A low-end version of Chameleon that uses PostScrip fonts rather than APTfonts, thus reducing significantly the price of a system.andM;ArchetypeandM;Halls 4, D17 (Atex) and 5, C11 (Pansophic)andM;Founded by some of the people who founded Lightspeed, Archetype has developedan interactive composition program called Designer that runs on PCs.andP;  It wasdesigned to be able to produce a wide variety of jobs, but initially foundits way into the display ad and magazine markets.andP;  Although Archetype sellsDesigner through dealers, most of its customers are found through OEM dealswith CText, Atex, Purdy and Associates, Computer Peripheral Systems,Pansophic and probably a few more companies.andP;  It also developed a produtcalled Network Manager that speeds graphics handling by storing images on anetwork server disk and sending a low-resolution view file for display.andM;ProductsandM;Archetype won't have its own stand, but will appear in the Atex exhibit(Kodak stand), showing its PC Page Makeup system, and on the Pansophic stand,where it will be integrated with the Presswork system producing full-colorpages.andP;  For more details, see Atex and Pansophic.andM;AtexandM;Hall 4, D17 (Kodak)andM;A subsidiary of Eastman Kodak, the U.S.-based Atex is one of the world'smajor newspaper suppliers.andP;  With European subsidiaries in England, France,Germany and the Netherlands, it supplies systems to many of the world'snewspapers and is the leading editorial and composition system supplier.andO;Atex recently announced a move for all of its products toward standardplatforms -- the IBM PS/2 family, the Sun Microsystems 3 and 4 ranges, andthe DEC Vax.andM;ProductsandM;Atex will focus on its equipment for the magazine and commercial markets: itsDesign Software for the Macintosh and its PC Page Makeup system for the PC.andO;A network of three PCs running Writer Software 2.0 will be producing copy forthe PC Page Makeup system, which uses software written for Atex by Archetype.andO;Design Software, also linked to the PCs, will be used for creating colorlayouts.andP;  File servers available for the system include Sun and IBM models.andM;Off the show floor, Atex will use a hotel suite to demonstrate its new 3000system, also based on PCs, but using  software developed by APT Systems ofthe UK.andP;  It supports Writer Software for text input and handamp;j, but a differentlayout program that was developed for a keyboard, rather than a mouse.andP;  A newversion of the program, to be shown in conjunction with Drupa, will support amouse, however.andP;  A Sun file server will be shown.andM;Aton Data BVandM;Hall 16, C68andM;The Dutch company Aton Data provides services for storage and archiving ofhigh-resolution images to be processed on color prodution systems.andP;  It is thelargest supplier in Europe of disk and tape products to users of Hell,Crosfield, Scitex, Dainippon Screen and 3M systems.andM;ProductsandM;Aton will demonstrate its 300-MB disk packs and magnetic tapes for colorelectronic page makeup systems, and the new Magnetic Module ProcessingSystem.andP;  The latter connects directly to a color system and includesremovable magnetic modules with a capacity of 100 to 1000 MB and a data seektime of 15 milliseconds.andP;  The device also has a SCSI interface.andM;AutologicandM;Hall 4, C30andM;Autologic has been one of the principal suppliers of high- andmedium-performance digital typesetters.andP;  A subsidiary of Volt InformationSciences Corporation, it is based in the U.S., with its internationalheadquarters in the UK.andP;  Its primary markets are newspapers, inhousepublishers, trade typesetters, advertising agencies and commercial printers.andM;ProductsandM;Autologic will launch a range of products with two themes: high-speedPostScript imaging and output of four-color separations.andM;A new plain-paper imager called the APS-1000, built around the Canon LBP-20engine, is said to be capable of 1,000 dpi horizontally and 500 verticallyand a speed of up to ten copies per minute.andP;  It will print on letter, legaland tabloid-size paper.andP;  It will probably be sold with the 250S RIP, butcould also be used with an 800S.andP;  The preliminary U.S.andP;  list price is$18,500.andM;Also shown will be the APS-6/84 recording at 1,446 dpi at 16.6&quot; per minutewith a width of 84 picas.andP;  Based on a custom version of an ECRM PelBox, it isintended for high-quality imaging of text and graphics in commercialapplications and can be used with the APS 250S, APS 800D, APS 800S, or APS PSPIP.andP;  Pricing has not yet been determined.andM;Autologic also will launch a high-performance version of the APS-PSPostScript Page Image Processor, which uses an Adobe RIP.andP;  This will be oneof several stands that will feature the latest Adobe product, which is basedon the MIPS R3000 RISC chip and which runs at five to seven times the speedof the previous Adobe RIP.andM;Also on display will be the Autologic Graphics Integrator (AGI) graphicssystem and the Amicus Arabic composition system.andP;  Other imagesettersavailable for demonstration are the 70-pica APS-6/70S, the 108-picaAPS-6/108S (both ECRM, PelBoxes) outputting four-color separations ofnewspaper pages, and low- and medium-resolution laser proofers.andP;  A number ofcomplementary devices, such as scanners, will also be in the booth.andO;Autologic will not be selling the equipment, but wants to demonstrate thatcomplete systems can be assembled including Autologic equipment.andM;On the Hoechst stand, Autologic will support the new Model 26variable-resolution laser imager developed jointly by Hoechst and GerberScientific Instrument Company.andP;  This device is for making direct-to-plateexposures.andM;Barco GraphicsandM;Hall 7, D33andM;Barco Graphics is a relatively new company formed by joining three separateorganizations: the Creative Division of the Barco Group; DISC, one of the twoworld's leading companies in the prepress business forms area; and Aesthedes,one of the world's leading computer design companies.andP;  Formed into onecompany at the start of 1990, this is now a large, specialized unit expectedto be a new challenger to the established color prepress vendors.andP;  BarcoGraphics' strategy, however, is to concentrate mostly on niche markets forcolor, such as labels and packaging, rather than on the standard color repromarkets.andM;ProductsandM;Products on display will include:andM;* Creator.andP;  The lastest release of the Creator creative painting andretouching system, which runs on Silicon Graphics hardware under the Unixoperating system, is available in four levels of configuration andperformance.andP;  The target customers range from creative design houses tohigh-level repro houses wanting powerful image manipulation, creation andretouching facilities.andM;* Superset.andP;  Aesthedes is the European distributor for Superset, which makesa high-resolution, real-time retouching system.andP;  A Superset system will beoperational in the Barco Booth.andM;* High-resolution Aesthedes 2 system.andP;  The enhanced version of the Aesthedes2 workstation for high-performance design of vector-based images now has a1,340 x 1,024-resolution, full-color screen and a larger buffer for contoneimages of 1,340 x 1,024 x 24 bits.andP;  The system provides for mor layers of animage being displayed on the separate layer monitors.andP;  It also has enhancedfacilities for vignetting.andM;* GT 2400 workstation.andP;  The new GT 2400 workstation is aimed at productionoperations for the forms, packaging and label areas of the market, and foroutputting four-color separations.andP;  It is claimed to offer unique facilitiesin color display with the mixing of full-color images and vector-based datafor text and vector graphics.andP;  This high-performance workstation usesmultiple RISC and CISC processors, but is fully compatible with the earlierDISC GT 900 family of workstations.andP;  It will be running applications softwarefor all markets and will be making images created on the Aesthedes andCreator workstations into complete pages, or package or label designs.andP;  Thesystem offers full 24-bit contone true-color image manipulation as well asfully interactive text composition and vector graphics creation and editing.andM;* PostScript input.andP;  Barco's PostScript input capability differs from mostothers in that it converts PostScript input into an editable Barco internalgraphic format.andP;  Most other systems (apart from Island Graphics [DainipponScreen] and Unda) convert data into uneditable line-work files.andM;* D3200 Laser Recorder.andP;  The smallest Barco laser recorder, the D3200 is alsothe only one to use a rollfed flatfield imaging unit.andP;  It uses the Bascocolor and text RIP and outputs to the 72-pica ECRM PelBox operating at 2,032dpi.andM;* D3800 Laser Recorder.andP;  Barco's new top-of-the-line D3800 laser recorderuses the same external drum principles as the D3600 and D33700 recordersdeveloped by DISC, but the drum for the D3800 takes film up to 43.3&quot; x 31.5&quot;in size and has a recording resolution of up to 4,000 dpi.andP;  It is linked withthe high-performance Barco RIP, which uses both URW and Bitstream fonts andon-the-fly electronic dot screening for color.andP;  Like other Barco drumrecorders, the D3800 can also be used as an input scanning system for linework.andM;* Color Proofer 2.andP;  The Color Proofer 2 uses the Iris 24&quot; x 24&quot; ink-jetproofer with a Barco controller.andP;  This device is linked to any of the threedifferent Barco workstations, or it can be linked to the DEC Vax system fileserver.andM;* Color Proofer 3.andP;  Based on the Kodak XL7700 thermal transfer dye printer,Barco's Color Proofer 3 is interfaced directly to the Creator system.andP;  It isdesigned for producing high-quality paper proofs and high-densitytransparencies with an excellent color match in sizes up to 11&quot; x 11&quot;.andP;  It isnot, however, seen as being quite good enough for second-generationtransparencies.andM;* System integration.andP;  All the Barco products will be linked via an Ethernetnetwork to a DEC Vax file server.andM;BedfordandM;Halls 4, A18 (FAG) and 10, G6-3 (Howtek)andM;One of the earliest developers of WYSIWYG displays for text compositionsystems, Bedford has offered facilities for math and commercial compositionas well as batch pagination.andP;  It was one of the first vendors to port itsUnix software to a Sun workstation, and it later added the Macintosh (runningunder A/UX) and the PC.andP;  It is represented by FAG in Germany and some otherEuropean countries.andM;ProductsandM;Bedford will have slightly different exhibits in its two locations.andP;  On theFAG stand, it will show the Mac and PC versions of its ProType system,emphasizing its support for both the NEC and Bedford keyboards and its batchpagination program.andM;In a cooperative demonstration with Howtek, it will show the Mac system fordesign and layout interfaced to a Howtek color scanner (an OEM version of the2,000-dpi Optronics ColorGetter 2000).andP;  Bedford will export page designs tothe Howtek color system for separation and output on a Bidco or ECRM PelBoxrecorder driven in PostScript mode.andM;BertholdandM;Hall 5.andP;  B24andM;H.andP;  Berthold is one of the world's largest suppliers of typesetting systems,aiming its products almost exclusively at the very high-quality compositionmarket, made up primarily of trade typesetters serving advertisingtypography.andM;ProductsandM;Berthold is showing a range of product enhancements and new products, bothmonochrome and color.andP;  In the color arena, it will announce ColourDesign, aproduct for creative design work.andP;  ColourDesign is a freehand illustrationpackage incorporating chokes and spreads; it is also used for rendering, incolor, files from other Berthold packages such as LineGraphic.andP;

 Masks can be created as regular shapes, user-definedpolygons or autotraces.andP;  Colors, based on HLS, RGB or CMY models, can bedefined by the user or sampled from an existing image.andP;  Objects cut from animage can be saved in a library and reused later with effects applied to them-- scaling, distortion, rotation, mirroring, replication and degradees.andO;Vector drawing tools are available.andM;For color correction, facilities include an on-screen densitometer, zooming,user-controllable undercolor removal and gray component replacement,sharpening or softening, and gradation modification.andM;Output will be to Autologic PostScript machines on the stand.andP;  Lotus claimsto be able to image four A4-sized page separations in a little more than 10minutes.andP;  It also claims to have developed its own system for applying screenangles that avoid the moire effects commonly associated with PostScriptcolor.andM;For job management, separation and printing information is displayed in ascrollable form.andM;MacDonald DettwilerandM;Hall 8, A06andM;MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates makes imaging devices and systems for manyapplications.andP;  Graphic arts products include recorders for producing proofsand &quot;second originals.&quot;andP;  MDA used to offer the Fire 300, which producedimages on Polaroid material.andP;  Today the principal product is the1,270-line-per-inch Fire 1000, which records &quot;second original&quot; transparencieson Ektachrome film.andM;ProductsandM;A standalone color transparency system, the Firelight, is making its debut atDrupa.andP;  Based on the Fire 1000 film recorder, this configuration alsoincludes a 25-MHz '386-based PC with 2 MB of RAM and a 600-MB hard disk; a20&quot; Sony VGA monitor and Truevision Targa display card; a tabletop 9-tracktape drive, for file input from other color systems; and color correctionsoftware developed by Shira Computers, running under Microsoft Windows.andM;When it reads a file from tape, Firelight can write it to disk for display,scaling, cropping and other enhancements, or it can image the file on the flyto the Fire 1000.andP;  The Firelight system's price will be in the neighborhoodof $250,000 in the United States.andM;Magna Computer SystemsandM;Hall 10, G06andM;Founded by Fred Rose and Bert Wigdor after they left the U.S.-based firmComputer Composition International (CCI), Magna set out to achieve a fullcomposition system on a PC.andM;It started with a single-user MagnaType system and followed that with aversion running on Novell networks.andP;  It probably has installed more PC-basedsystems in commercial operations than any other vendor.andM;The system is code driven, with nice formatting capabilities, a basicpagination program and a fast soft-copy preview.andM;ProductsandM;Magna will highlight its newest development, which was previewed at theSeybold Seminars in March: software for laying out pages interactively, witha WYSIWYG display of graphics and text on the page.andP;  It runs within theWindows environment.andM;Highlights include composing type inside or ouside of irregular shapes, iconsand dialog boxes for controlling operations, precision in placement ofelements, a pasteboard for placing graphics prior to bringing them onto thepage, display of text scaled to actual size and width, editing in a separatetext window, and linking of frames to flow text over multiple columns orpages.andM;Mannesmann ScangraphicandM;Hall 4, B06andM;Scangraphic is one of the world's leading suppliers of typesetting systems.andO;Not a long-standing supplier in the same manner as Berthold, Linotype orMonotype, Scangraphic has risen to prominence in the last ten years byconcentrating on the high-quality trade typesetting market.andP;  Its firstproduct was the CRT-based Scantext 1000; it then moved into laser technologywith the 2000 system.andP;  The company generally builds its own hardware,although it is planning to introduce a system in the near future using SunMicrosystems computers.andM;ProductsandM;The Scantext 2000 system is a complete system for color production of text,graphics and, following Drupa, color images.andP;  Introduced at Drupa in 1986,the Scantext 2000 has since undergone extensive development.andP;  The latestenhancements:andM;* Scantext Commander S30.andP;  The Scantext Commander is the full monochrome textand graphics workstation of the Scantext system.andP;  Its central processor wasrecently upgraded from a Motorola 68020 to a 68030, boosting calculationperformance by 40 percent.andP;  The commander S30 will support all existingScantext software and connects to the ELAN 2000 network.andM;* Scantext 2000 Color Commander.andP;  The new Color Commander workstation issoftware compatible with other Scantext 2000 workstations and runs theirfiles without change.andP;  In addition, however, it manipulates color images andoutputs color-separated files.andP;  The unit uses the same Motorola 68030processor, OS/9 operating system, and Transputer-based communications systemof the Commander S30, but with an Intel i860 processor for color processingand another Transputer for the high-speed screen display.andP;  The unit featuressubstantial memory and disk storage and a 24-bit Sony Trinitron monitor.andM;* Scantext 1015 Color ImageScanner.andP;  The new CCD-based Color scanner for theColor Commander uses a 5,184-element array to detect 12 bits of color dataper color, giving an excellent 4,096-gray-level density range per color.andP;  Thescanner uses artificial intelligence techniques to incorporate traditionalcolor skills in an automated, simplified setup procedure.andP;  Unlike most otherscanners, it does not have a color preview monitor; instead, it shows imagesand color separations on a monochrome screen.andM;* Scantext 2000 Supervisor S30.andP;  The central management file server andcontroller for the Scantext system, the Supervisor also handles allcommunications into the system from a wide range of non-MannesmannScangraphic devices.andP;  Filters for DDES and TIFF are offered, as is the optionof generating text and line art that may be transferred via the &quot;Shira&quot;interface to Crosfield, Hell and Scitex systems.andP;  At Drupa, Scangraphicexpects to have Macintosh computers, running Letraset Color-Studio imageretouching software, linked to its system via the Supervisor S30.andP;  Imageswill be retouched on the Mac before they are incorporated into pages andseparated for output within the Scantext Color Commander.andM;* Scantext 2030 and 2051 imagesetters.andP;  Output of both monochrome and colorpages from the Scantext 2000 system is to the existing Scantext 2030 and2051internal drum imagesetters.andP;  These use standard electronic screening forcolor introduced in 1989.andM;* Scantext 2030 PD and Scantext 2051 PD.andP;  These two new, dedicated,PostScript-only imagesetters are targeted at the evolving PostScript colormarket.andP;  They use the same internal drum principle of output as the existing2030 and 2051 imagesetters, but they are mechanically simpler due to theirlaser diode exposure, where the laser diode is mounted directly on theexposure traveler within the drum.andP;  The other main difference is that theunits contain the new Adobe Emerald RIP (based on the MIPS R3000 RISC chip),which Adobe claims will offer a five-fold increase in performance over theexisting Atlas Plus RIP.andP;  With their high resolution, proven accuracy andrepeatability and attractive prices, these imagesetters could be verysignificant products in the PostScript color market.andM;Metronic-GeratebauandM;Hall 8, E21andM;Metronic-Geratebau focuses on printing machinery for the packaging industryand will launch an ink-jet printer for the packaging market.andM;ProductsandM;The AlphaJet coding machine is a computer-controlled ink-jet printer, basedon the continuous drop production process, which allows it to print at amaximum speed of 3.5 meters/second onto any surface.andM;Miles 33andM;Hall 6-2, D36andM;Miles 33 is a major UK supplier of multiuser systems to the commercial marketin Europe;

 Harlequin is new in the high-resolution PostScriptmarket, but we understand that its RIP is very fast.andM;UndaandM;Hall 7, E03andM;Unda is one of the color companies that have appeared in the past few years.andO;It is perhaps the first one to bridge the area from creative design to a fullproduction system handling high-resolution color files, outputting both intoother high-end color systems and to PostScript imagesetters.andP;  The company wasfounded in 1985 by experienced professionals from the color industry and theprepress market.andM;Unda, which manufacturers no hardware, integrates its software with computersand other hardware from American and Japanese suppliers to create turnkeysystems.andP;  It builds its systems around Sun Microsystems platforms.andP;  It offersvarious levels of system, from creative design to production.andM;ProductsandM;In addition to showing its Color Design and Production Systems, Unda willdemonstrate several new items that were previewed at the recent SeyboldSeminars in Boston.andM;* Image Station.andP;  This is a new full-scale retouching system forhigh-resolution images.andP;  Running on a Sun sparcstation 330 computer with a24-bit display, it provides a wide range of masking and retouching tools anda unique window on high-resolution data when working on the screen-resolutionfile.andP;  The unit is connected to existing Unda networks.andP;  Final separationsare made on the file in the Unda production system for output on PostScriptimagesetters or to Unda proofers.andM;* Color Quick Printing System.andP;  This software connects the Canon Color LaserCopier 500 to the Unda system to allow for the Canon unit to be used as animage scanner and for outputting of proofs.andP;  Unda is targeting the system atquick printers and ad agencies, but it also has potential as a scanning andproofing system in a conventional color market because the color qualityappears to be readily acceptable for many requirements.andP;  The interface alsoallows input of still-video images from separate still-video disk readersconnected to the interface.andM;* PostScript interpreter.andP;  The Unda PostScript interpreter differs from mostothers in that it reads PostScript files and converts them into Unda'sinternal graphic and text format.andP;  This means that data can be modified andenhanced as part of an Unda system, and the pages are standard Unda pages.andM;Varityper/TegraandM;Hall 5, C35 (AM International)andM;One of the few century-old companies in the industry, Varityper earlier wasin the typewriter business and later moved on to headline machines,typesetters and single- and multiterminal composition systems.andP;  It hasremained a fixture in several parts of the industry in spite of a couple ofescapades along the acquisition road.andM;Varityper was acquired by Addressograph-Multigraph (which later became AMInternational) in the 1950s, after which it was known as AM Varityper.andP;  In1988, Tegra purchased Varityper from AM, although AM retained internationaldistribution rights to the Varityper products, which is why it appears on theAM stand at Drupa.andM;ProductsandM;The biggest news will be on the PostScript RIP front.andP;  Varityper will unveilRISC-based PostScript RIPs for both its Series 4000 (Adobe) and its Series5000 (Tegra) controllers.andM;For the Series 4000, Varityper will be one of six vendors known to be readyto show the new Adobe RIP.andP;  We understand that in tests with the Varityperrecorders, it has run generally four to six times faster than the company'sSpeedPlus RIP, which uses a Motorola 68020.andM;For its Series 5000 PostScript Compatible Interpreter, which employs aninterpreter from Custom Applications, Varityper has added an AMD 29000coprocessor board and Tegra/Varityper hardware.andM;Also for the Series 5000 will be the Front-End Graphics II program forcaching graphics and accessing them at the time a job is output withouthaving to rasterize them again each time they are printed.andM;The Series 5000 will be driving the 5500 (Canon LBP-20), 5510 (Canon DX),5330 (ECRM PelBox 3000) and 5100 (108-pica Pelbox) recorders.andM;We expect to see the series 4000 supporting Kanji output, as it did at therecent Seybold Seminars.andM;Finally, Varityper will demonstrate its ImageScanner 1200, which is based onthe Xerox 7650.andP;  It will be shown in support of both the Series 4000 and5000, its Epics system with PostScript graphics capabilities, and PrintMasterand some other desk accessories.andM;Varityper remains one of the few major vendors that hasn't announced itsplans for handling color.andP;  If anything develops in time for Drupa, we'llreport on it after the show.andM;XyvisionandM;Hall 5, A20 (Chromos Inter)andM;Xyvision is an American company with subsidiaries in Europe.andP;  It hasdeveloped and supplies a powerful composition and publishing system fortechnical documentation and inplant and corporate publishing.andP;
