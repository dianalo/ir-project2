Britain's National Westminster Bank PLC and Midland Bank PLC have followed the U.S. lead, and there are indications that other banks in Europe, Canada and the Middle East also may follow suit.    Among the banks involved in the Japanese discussions are Fuji Bank Ltd., DaiIchi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.    The discussions are taking place based on a Finance Ministry request. &quot;We've been discussing the issue and they're reviewing their opinions on the subject in order to come up with more concrete proposals,&quot; said the ministry official, who asked not to be identified. &quot;The ball is in their court, and when they're ready, they'll bring the ball to us.&quot;    The official stressed that while the ministry is conducting its own study on the question, it has yet to develop a public stance. &quot;We don't know by how much or when such loan-loss reserves will be increased,&quot; he said.    The discussions are part of a continuing effort to buttress the banks against the consequences of troubled loans to Third-World debtor countries. In March, a group of 28 Japanese commercial banks set up a company in the British Cayman Islands to assume part of their loans outstanding to Latin American countries.    The ministry, however, is going slow on the matter of loan-loss reserves, according to some observers. Government officials, according to an industry source, are said to be concerned about whether adding to loan-loss reserves will allow Japanese banks to evade certain taxes.    The ministry official would only say yesterday that the subject of what types of assets to count as overall loan-loss reserves has stirred debate between the government and the banks in the past and that &quot;there will be debate again this year.&quot;    Japanese commercial banks have the world's second-highest loan exposure to developing countries, after the U.S. The lion's share of such loans has been made to Latin American borrowers. The Finance Ministry estimates that at the end of 1985, the latest year for which statistics are available, Japanese banks' loans outstanding to Latin American countries totaled $30 billion.    Any reserve increase by Japan's big banks would come at a time when the size of their capital is the subject of international negotiation. Japanese banks own big portfolios of equities, which have benefited from the massive run-up in prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange over the past several years.    What percentage of the value of these equity holdings should be counted in these banks' capital for international comparative purposes is now a topic of negotiation between Japan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England, New York bankers said.    The Fed and the British central bank are eager to persuade Japan to join their agreement on common standards for banks' capital adequacy. But a standard for valuing banks' equity holdings will have to be agreed upon before this can take place, New York bankers said. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York declined comment on the continuing talks.    ---   Provisions at Arab Banks   Special to The Wall Street Journal    MANAMA, Bahrain -- At least two major Arab banks are examining the level of their loan-loss provisions following moves by leading U.S. banks to set aside substantial sums because of problem Third-World loans, especially in Latin America.    Arab Banking Corp. and Gulf International Bank, among the largest banks in the Middle East, said they are at least considering whether to add to their reserves or not.    Abdulla Saudi, president and chief executive of Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp., said his bank &quot;can't afford to ignore current trends in the market,&quot; especially because the bank &quot;seeks to operate to the highest international standards.&quot; However, he also said that the bank is &quot;adequately provided for against potential losses in its portfolio, and its capital base isn't in danger.&quot;    Banking regulators in the Middle East have been relatively reserved. The Bahrain Monetary Agency said it hasn't instructed the island's roughly 70 offshore banks to set aside a specific percentage of their debt as a loan-loss provision. </TEXT></DOC>
