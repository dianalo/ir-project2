The report, &quot;The Changing Distribution of Federal Taxes: 1975-1990,&quot; documents the extent to which the federal tax system has become less progressive, and thus less fair, since the mid-1970s.    Every other review of the report of which I am aware affirms its central finding -- that the past decade has been marked by a significant shift toward greater income inequality in America that has been aggravated by changes in the federal tax system over the same period.    The Journal's editors looked at the same report and concluded, &quot;What the report really shows is that not only are the rich paying more in taxes but that the Laffer Curve has also worked pretty much as advertised.&quot; From this comment your readers could fairly conclude that the report has something to say about the Laffer Curve and its corollary-supply-side economics. But it does not.    The central finding of the CBO study concerns the shifting of federal tax burdens in recent years as measured by taxes paid as a percent of income. In 1988, all income groups except the highest earning 10% will be paying about the same or more in total federal taxes than they paid in 1977. The largest shifts in tax burdens will occur at the income extremes. For example, next year the poorest tenth of Americans will be paying 17% to 20% more in taxes than they did in 1977. In contrast, the highest-income tenth of the population will be paying 6% to 10% less. The highest-income 1% -- taxpayers with average incomes in excess of $400,000 -- will pay 19% to 25% less in federal taxes.    The CBO analysis also reveals a large shift in national income during these years. Between 1977 and 1988, the bottom 80% of the population by income will have experienced a decline in real income while the income of the top 10% will have increased about 15%. Meanwhile, the income of the top 5% will have increased more than 20% and the income of the top 1% will have increased between 40% and 50%. These are all before-tax measurements of income.    On an after-tax basis, the shift in income has been even greater. For example, the income of the top 1% of the population by income will have increased by as much as 63% on an after-tax basis between 1977 and 1988. These figures document the extent to which those with the highest incomes have benefited from recent changes in federal tax laws while all other Americans are either worse off or in the same position.    The same table in the appendix cited by the Journal also shows that the share of national income going to the top 10% by income increased by more than 12% between 1977 and 1984, yet their share of taxes increased by only one-third that amount. In contrast, the share of income going to the bottom 50% of all families by income declined by more than 8% while their share of taxes declined by only 3%.    Finally, the CBO report indicated that Americans as a whole will pay roughly the same share of their income in federal taxes in 1988 (22.7%) as they did in 1977 (22.8%). The total tax burden relative to national income is approximately the same, despite the 1981 tax bill, because Social Security payroll taxes were increased in 1977 and 1983 to meet the future financing needs of a Social Security System that will pay benefits to a growing population of retired people. In effect, the increase in the Social Security payroll tax was offset by the 1981 cut in income taxes.    As a result, there has been a shift of about $80 billion in annual revenue collections from the progressive income tax to the regressive payroll tax. The Social Security tax increase in 1977 cannot be attributed to the current administration. But the response in the 1980s -- to make up for a tax increase disproportionately burdening lower-income households with a tax cut disproportionately benefiting higher-income households -- can be laid to the policies of this administration.    The CBO report reveals the magnitude of this change in the distribution of tax burdens. As tax policy makers consider future changes in federal revenues they should be aware of the trend toward a less fair federal revenue system.    Sen. George J.
