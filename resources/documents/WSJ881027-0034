The Immigration Department notified the newspaper in a letter that its application for an employment pass for Hong Kong-based staff reporter Steven Jones had been disapproved. No reason was given.    The Asian Journal hasn't had a reporter based in Singapore since July, when the government declined to renew the one-year employment pass of staff reporter John Berthelsen, who is now based in Bangkok. No reason was given.    Barry Wain, the Asian Journal's editor, said, &quot;We are disappointed by the government's decision.&quot;    The Asian Journal's majority owner is Dow Jones andamp; Co. of the U.S., which also publishes this newspaper and owns the Far Eastern Economic Review. The Hong Kong-based magazine hasn't been allowed to have a reporter in Singapore since April 1987.    Singapore has severely restricted distribution of the Asian Journal and the Review, maintaining that they have interfered in domestic politics. Singapore refused to allow reporters from the two publications into the country to cover the September general election. </TEXT></DOC>
