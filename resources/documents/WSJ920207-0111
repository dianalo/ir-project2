We are told that&quot;communism is dead,&quot; despite the fact that nearly 1.2 billionChinese live under a bloody Communist regime. We are alsotold that &quot;democracy is flourishing south of the border.&quot; Buttwo old-fashioned military coups have taken place within afew months in desperately poor Haiti and oil-rich Venezuela.   Just past midnight on Tuesday, only minutes after thereturn of President Carlos Andres Perez from the U.S. andSwitzerland, a crack paratrooper contingent of two battalions(1,600 men) attacked the Francisco de Miranda air base, thepresidential mansion nearby, and the presidential palace indowntown Caracas. President Perez was able to escape twice,first from the presidential mansion and a short time later,with just an aide-de-camp, from the palace, as theparatroopers started their attack. He took refuge for a whilein a hotel of ill repute, before going to the televisionheadquarters of his friend, Gustavo Cisneros. Gov. OswaldoAlvarez Paz of Zulia, the Christian Democrat oppositionleader, was detained in Maracaibo by insurgent forces for 11hours, and skirmishes took place in Valencia and Maracay.</LP><TEXT>   But by late Tuesday morning, the rebel leader, 38-year-oldLt. Col. Hugo Chavez Frias, was in the hands of loyal troops.In front of a television camera, he pleaded with his cohortsin other cities to surrender without additional bloodshed. Itis interesting to note, nonetheless, that Lt. Col. Chaveztold his followers to give up because &quot;the coup's objectivescannot for now be attained.&quot; There is little doubt thatkilling President Perez was one of the goals.   To understand what's going on in Venezuela, we mustexamine the current constitution, adopted by a majority ofMr. Perez's Social Democrats, together with ChristianDemocrats and Marxists in 1961, three years after theoverthrow of our last military dictatorship. It isconceptually closer to the constitution of the old SovietUnion than to the U.S. Constitution.   The U.S. Founding Fathers believed in fundamental andinalienable rights held by individuals prior to the formationof the state. Further, the Bill of Rights maintains thatgovernment will not intrude on the rights of individuals, andnowhere is it implied that the state has the power ofgranting rights.   Under the Venezuelan Constitution, however, &quot;social&quot; and&quot;economic&quot; rights are offered as gracious gifts of the state,and pertain to education, medical care, vacations, housingand jobs. Under Article 73, for example, &quot;the State willprotect the family . . . will see to its moral and economicsituation . . . will provide for the purchase of a healthyand comfortable home.&quot; Article 76 places health care as aright of the citizens. Article 78 grants free schooling fromkindergarten to postgraduate work. Article 82 introducescorporatist elements, determining by law those professionsthat require college degrees and licenses as well asmembership in certain guilds. (In my own case, I was able towork as editor in chief of a Caracas newspaper, but could notwork as a reporter because I had not attended a school ofjournalism nor was I a member of the union.)   Article 86 provides for paid vacations and holidays,adding that the state will strive toward a shorter workingday, &quot;and convenient measures will be implemented for thebetter use of free time.&quot; Article 87 pertains to minimum and&quot;just&quot; wages. Article 98 sanctions the government's economicplanning and regulation, as well as controlling thedistribution of wealth. Article 99 speaks of the &quot;socialfunction&quot; of private property. Article 105 deplores theexistence of large farms, as &quot;contrary to the socialinterest,&quot; contending that they shall be eliminated by law.   Despite Venezuela's oil riches, at no time have thevarious regimes been able to afford the high cost of itsconstitutionally mandated welfare system. But that hasn'tstopped the promises. For more than a generation, weVenezuelans have been told by politicians that they deservethe very best, and that only greedy oil magnates, foreignbankers or unjust terms of trade keep them in a state ofdeprivation.   Such an environment may seem anathema to foreigninvestors. But Mr. Perez's policy of state-sponsoredmega-projects, while doing nothing for small foreign ordomestic entrepreneurs, is a paradise for huge corporationslooking for special privileges in partnership with either thegovernment, party big shots or other members of the localnomenklatura. Venezuelan government ministers present astaggering amount of macroeconomic statistics to show thatVenezuela's private sector is flourishing, without realizingthat a free market cannot flourish under the centralgovernment's planning.   What has been growing in Venezuela is the bureaucracy thatsupports the huge state interests. In 1990, the governmentpayroll was increased by 150,000 new bureaucrats and thestate enterprises accounted for much of the budget deficit.   Still, the Venezuelan Central Bank -- which might be moreappropriately called the National Printing Press Authority --places my country at the very top of economic growth in theAmericas for 1991 -- way ahead of Chile, Mexico andArgentina, where truly free-market measures are beingimplemented. The problem is that these flamboyant statisticsadd up the production of state enterprises and governmentservices that have little or no relationship to thewell-being of the majority of Venezuela's 20 millioncitizens. One is reminded of the old Soviet number crunchers,who for decades placed the growth of the Socialist world farahead of free-market economies.   Part of the tragedy is that Mr. Perez's so-called&quot;free-market&quot; policies are blamed for the current hardshipsby most of the local and international media. They fail tounderstand the diametrically opposed principles of marketcapitalism vs. the country's mercantilistic doctrine. Some ofthe blame, I have no doubt, is due to the government's blitheacceptance of International Monetary Fund policies -- such asincreasing taxes, raising the price of gas and the cost ofpublic services, etc. -- in order to obtain additionalforeign lending, which will be spent by elite bureaucrats andpaid for by the sweat of our children and grandchildren.   Of course, a military dictatorship could only make mattersworse in a country where half the population earns about $100a month, which allows for just one square meal a day.Soldiers are not exactly Latin America's most enlightenedcitizens, and they tend to support the further centralizationof power and decision making, something that has plagued ussince colonial times.   It is fine for President Bush to support the democraticgovernment of Venezuela. But to call Carlos Andres Perez -- aman who helped initiate and then perpetuate the statistsystem that is crippling our country -- one of the greatdemocratic leaders of the hemisphere somewhat devalues thefull concept of political and economic liberty. It alsopoints to a short-term expedience governing U.S. foreignpolicy toward Latin America.   ---   Mr. Ball, a Venezuelan journalist, heads a news featuresand syndication service for Latin American newspapers.</TEXT></DOC>
