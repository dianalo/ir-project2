Analyses reveal sequential diagenetic events thatcan be divided into four primary zones. Zone 1 includes early events:(a) development of clay rims on framework constituents; (b) extensivemechanical compaction, which continues into deeper burial; and (c) earlydiagenetic dissolution of unstable framework components and selectivereplacement by illitic clays and/or calcite. Zone 2 represents a periodof widespread cementation: (a) precipitation of K-feldspar and quartzovergrowths; (b) generation of intergranular ferroan calcite (or, locally,siderite) and mixed-layer illite-smectite (approximately 40-60% illite);and (c) albitization of K-feldspar (plus albite overgrowths). In zone3, extensive dissolution and local development of secondary porosityoccurred. Zone 4 reveals porosity-occluding diagenetic products associatedwith zone 3 leaching, such as kaolinite, chlorite, pyrite, calcite, andzeolites (e.g., heulandite, analcite), and indicates continued albitizationof K-feldspar. Development of secondary porosity is highly localizedwithin given reservoir units, ranging from extensively leached zonesto areas where leaching is minimal (or where late-stage carbonate cementsocclude porosity). Porosity enhancement is linked to kerogen decarboxylationprocesses and continues during catagenesis. Diagenetic relationshipssuggest that most samples have not experienced temperatures in excessof 140{sup 0}-160{sup 0}C. Modal data coincide closely with other UpperCretaceous sandstones sources primarily from the Cordilleran magmatic-arcsystem to the east and northeast (dissected arc sandstones; plutonic-volcanicsource).</TEXT></DOC>
