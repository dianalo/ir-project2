The Daily News reported that ``ghost classes'' at Adlai E.Stevenson High School in the borough of the Bronx had titles suchas ``Literature and Art,'' but consisted mainly of students runningerrands for teachers.   ``There was no classroom to go to,'' Jim Fairclough, a teacherfor 18 years, told News columnist Bob Herbert. ``The kids were usedas gofers.''   Board of Education spokesman Frank Sobrino acknowledged Tuesdaythat allegations of ghost classes at Stevenson were underinvestigation and that Inspector General Michael Sofarelli hadcompleted a draft report.   Until it has been reviewed by the board, he said, ``we're justnot going to be making any comment.''   Herbert quoted from an affidavit that was part of the evidencecompiled by Sofarelli, in which a 1988 Stevenson graduate said shetook the ``Literature and Art'' honors course as a senior.   ``This course consisted of delivering books to English teachersand storing books in the book room. I also opened up the computerroom and delivered lessons to the substitute teachers. Andsometimes I delivered messages to the teachers themselves,'' shesaid.   The student, now in college, received a score of 90 for her workin the course.   Neill Rosenfeld, a teachers' union spokesman, said the``Literature and Art'' class, intended to be an independent studycourse, was eliminated last October after the United Federation ofTeachers filed a grievance.   He said he did not know if the administration or individualteachers were to blame for the abuses.   UFT President Sandra Feldman said in a statement that the unionhad been trying to stamp out phantom classes at Stevenson for years.   The News said there were similarly phony classes for studentswho needed remedial English.   ``One of the transcripts shows that a kid who was a couple ofyears behind in his reading got a 90 in both the reading tutorclass and the advanced Literature and Art class,'' Fairclough said.``Why would a kid who was behind in his reading be in an advancedliterature class?''   The school is holding summer school classes now and none of theregular staff, including principal Michael Weber, will be backuntil late August, school officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
