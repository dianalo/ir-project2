Eagle-Beacon on Arctic oil drilling:   Advocates of oil drilling and development on the wild coastalplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge like to imply thatpeople in the oil states support the proposal.   This newspaper in this oil state does not support the proposal;in fact, we believe the coastal plain should be placed _ as therest of the Arctic refuge already has been _ in the NationalWilderness Preservation System.   This is, after all ``the most biologically productive part ofthe Arctic refuge for wildlife,'' in the words of a draft InteriorDepartment report _ a report that was censored and its conclusionsaltered so it came out supporting oil drilling there anyway.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 22   Alamogordo (N.M.) Daily News on a proposal to legalize drugs:   Election year posturing drives politicians' anti-drug rhetoricto hysteria levels, some very extreme and absurd ideas have gainedunwarranted respectability.   Chief among these is the notion that legalizing heroin, cocaineand other addictive substances will alleviate America's alarmingdrug problem.   The logic behind this proposal is identical to giving a drunkanother drink to cure his alcoholism.   Making illicit narcotics legal, and thus cheaper and even morereadily available, would not discourage drug abuse.   On the contrary, legalization would cause consumption to soarand magnify to a dangerous degree the full range of personal andsocietal destruction caused by drug use.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 23   Baltimore Sun on apartheid:   The newest debate over economic sanctions against South Africaraises familiar questions about the effectiveness of sanctions andthe impact on the people they are designed to help.   It also raises anew the issue of where the United States shouldstand in the battle over apartheid, the racist system upheld by thewhite-minority government in Pretoria. ...   Two sweeping sanctions bills have been introduced in Congress.Both would bar most U.S. trade with South Africa and requireAmerican firms to withdraw their investments.   The new sanctions would be much stronger, but if the UnitedStates is alone in imposing them, legitimate questions can still beraised about their effectiveness against a determined Pretoriagovernment and eager investors from other countries.   It also is fair to ask how the sanctions would affect blacks,since their victimization by the apartheid regime is the source ofU.S. concerns.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 19   The San Luis Obispo (Calif.) Telegram-Tribune on removingNoriega:   The Reagan Administration has made a mess of its attempts tooust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's drug-dealing dictator.   Each day seems to bring a new proposal, the latest being that ifNoriega steps down, his hand-picked president could remain inoffice until elections are held next year.   That makes even less sense than a White House offer to drop thedrug charges against Noriega if he'll get out of office andeventually out of the country entirely. ...   Sol Linowitz, former ambassador to the Organization of AmericanStates and perhaps the most respected U.S. observer of LatinAmerican affairs, proposes that the Reagan administration practicemediation rather than muscle.   Let's enlist the help of neighboring Latin states in trying totalk sense to Noriega, says Linowitz. ...   Noriega is not likely to leave in the face of the bully tacticsthat have been tried by the White House. Also, the sanctions havehurt the Panamanian people more than their self-styled leader,stirring bitterness against the United States. ...   Getting him to take a walk will require a bunch of carrotsrather than a bundle of sticks.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 23   The Dallas Morning News on George Bush:   Vice President George Bush finally stepped outside the shadow ofPresident Reagan, however slightly, on the issue of Panamanian Gen.Manuel Noriega and drugs.   That should encourage supporters who have watched Bush continueto sink in the polls. The latest Gallup Poll has Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis leading Bush nationally by 54 to 38 percent. ...   Pollsters also are finding out that voters believe the Democratsare handling the drug issue better than the Republicans.   So Bush said recently that as president, ``I won't bargain withdrug dealers ... whether they're on U.S. or foreign soil.''   He said the anti-drug effort he has spearheaded wasn't enough,and he outlined a program in which the vice president would be the``drug czar'' in a Bush administration.   It's time that George Bush stop hiding behind the cloak of his``loyalty'' to President Reagan and establish his own identity.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 20   The Bellingham (Wash.) Herald on the Supreme Court decision ontrash:   The U.S. Supreme Court was too cavalier with individual rightswhen it ruled police are free to search through barrels and bagspeople leave out for trash collection.   The decision, made in regard to a 1984 narcotics case in LagunaBeach, Calif., allows police to search through garbage without awarrant and without any reason to suspect criminal activity. ...   It is disturbing that a majority on the Supreme Court believesmost Americans wouldn't object to police picking through theirtrash without a warrant on a fishing expedition for evidence thatmight implicate them in a crime. ...   The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution reads, ``The right ofthe people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, andEFFECTS against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not beviolated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,supported by oath and affirmation and particularly describing theplace to be searched, and the persons or things to be searched.''   Does a majority on the Supreme Court believe most Americans donot consider their trash as part of their effects?</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
