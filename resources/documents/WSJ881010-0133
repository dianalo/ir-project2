Complete with bold innovations such as 3-D graphics, rock music and four attractive hosts, it was positioned to be the news for the MTV age.    But &quot;USA Today: The Television Show&quot; (nightly on syndicated stations; check local listings) is going down the tubes fast. Critics are savaging it, audiences are avoiding it, and syndicators have begun searching for replacements in record time. Executive Producer Steve Friedman and the ever-successful Grant Tinker, president of GTG, are frantically trying to retool the show, but after a month on the air the basic problem remains: &quot;USA Today,&quot; touted as the latest word in info-tainment, doesn't work as news or as entertainment. Here's why:   USELESS FEATURES. What can you say about a program that highlights a call-in poll on &quot;The Penny: Save It or Lose It?&quot; and announces, &quot;One viewer tells us: 'Pennies just get in the way when you want to find real change.' But others say 'What's America without the penny?'&quot;    BIZARRE LITTLE FACTS. In both its original and its remodeled form, &quot;USA Today&quot; seems to thrive on arcane trivia and useless information. One example: &quot;Seattle is the country's recycling leader.&quot; Most of these facts are presented without lead-in or explanation, just one sentence and no context. Of course, the bigger stories get several sentences: &quot;Mark Oct. 22nd on your calendar. That's that day the cast of 'Gilligan's Island' reunites at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana, Calif. All of the castaways, including Bob Denver, Jim Backus and Tina Louise, will be pitching in to raise money for the school's telecommunications department.&quot;    GRATING OPTIMISM. Inspired by the &quot;journalism of hope&quot; of &quot;USA Today: The Newspaper,&quot; &quot;USA Today: The Television Show&quot; is more unflaggingly cheerful, more unremittingly upbeat than &quot;Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.&quot; One lead item last week began, &quot;A spectacular touch-down as Discovery returns and millions cheer across the USA today.&quot; -   CONFUSING STRUCTURE. Since the program tries to shoehorn in lots of separate little bits and pieces, the structure is often disorienting, hard to follow. For example, each night one of the four hosts introduces a profile: Tonight, artist Peter Max. But first, this about video rentals. Now back to Peter Max.    RECKLESS SPEED. Even in discussing the most complex subjects, like teen-age sex in the AIDS era or genetic fingerprinting, no guest expert gets more than two 10-second sound bites.    ANNOYING POLLS. &quot;USA Today&quot; is a big believer in polls. One brief segment last week about &quot;Crime on Campus&quot; had no fewer than seven polls, more than one a minute. Some were meaningless (&quot;Do students trust campus security?&quot;). Some were outrageous and misleading (&quot;27% of co-eds have been sexually assaulted&quot;). Add in the aggravating habit (a hand-me-down from the newspaper) of using polls to announce what &quot;we&quot; want and &quot;we&quot; believe. It's almost like Soviet TV: &quot;We favor the speed limit being increased from 55 to 65.&quot; Tell me what percentage of Americans feels what way. But don't tell me what I think. I know what I think.    AWKWARD WRITING. &quot;Tonight, we go to a high-tech base where our soldiers train for combat in West Germany deep in the heart of Texas.&quot; Not to mention the little bons mots at the close of each show: After a profile of &quot;football's dirtiest team,&quot; the Houston Oilers, host Robin Young piped up, &quot;I thought you were talking about the players who got the dirtiest when they played.&quot;    SLIM PICKINGS. This is the biggest sin, the gravest. First, story selection is poor: A recent &quot;cover&quot; piece on the new supermodels, for example, was old news two years ago. Then, the stories picked are treated in trivial, insubstantial ways. In a recent profile of Randy Travis, the &quot;boy wonder&quot; of country music, all we learn is that he likes to wear jeans and a T-shirt. Hold the presses!    Coverage of the Discovery landing consisted, in its entirety, of watching an &quot;average&quot; family at the landing site, with the father pointing up in the sky and telling his son, &quot;Look, there it is.&quot;    REDEEMING FEATURES. No matter what, &quot;USA Today&quot; definitely is better than the game shows it's going to be replaced with. The music and graphics are fun. Once in a while, there's an interesting angle on a big story, like the millions in athletic endorsements Ben Johnson lost along with his gold medal. And some of the slice-of-life vignettes and profiles (the Viet Vet who's out on the Florida streets fighting against AIDS; the recycling center run by the homeless) are not only interesting, but touching as well.    CONCLUSION. There's nothing wrong with the premise of &quot;USA Today&quot; -- giving viewers information in a fast, lively way. But in a news program (even a &quot;soft news&quot; program), there has to be more than zippy music and splashy graphics. There has to be some substance. People crave it. That's why &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; have lasted as long as they have. And that's why &quot;USA Today&quot; is striking out. &quot;We&quot; want more. </TEXT></DOC>
