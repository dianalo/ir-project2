Albert J. Hunter, who allegedly killed his wife and commandeeredthe plane Wednesday, bought a semiautomatic rifle on Jan. 17, thesame day killer Patrick E. Purdy went on a rampage in Stockton,Calif., The Boston Globe reported.   Witnesses have identified the gun as an AK-47, but ballisticexperts studying the casings recovered from the strafing had notconfirmed that.   A person who answered the telephone at Bob's Tactical ShootingRange and Gun Shop in Salisbury, where authorities said Hunterbought the gun, said, ``I don't know anything about it,'' and hungup, the Globe reported.   Hunter, a Vietnam veteran and armored reconaissance specialistin Germany, worked at the U.S. Postal Service's South Postal Annexin Boston.   A co-worker there, who refused to give his name, told the Globethat Hunter was impressed by the carnage created by Purdy, whosprayed the schoolyard with bullets from an AK-47, killing fivechildren and wounding 30 before committing suicide.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has sought to ban assaultrifles in the state, and was expected to use Wednesday's incidentto back up his cause.   Police believe Hunter used the AK-47 to kill his ex-wife,Elvira, and to commandeer a Cessna 152 from a flight instructor atBeverly airport. They said he fired randomly down at the cityduring a three-hour flight over greater Boston, hitting buildingsand airplanes parked at Logan International Airport.   Hunter pleaded innocent to murder and assault charges after hiscapture Wednesday, and was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for20 days' psychiatric observation.</TEXT></DOC>
