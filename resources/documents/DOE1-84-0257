With localizedliver diseases (n=323) CT had a specificity of 85%, a sensitivity of81% and an accuracy of 84%. The total correct diagnoses by diffuse liverdiseases (n=265) was 65%. In the differential diagnostis of icterus CThad a specificity of 100%, a sensitivity of 77%, and an accuracy of 83%.In the diagnosis of gall stones (n=19) CT only had a mediocre diagnosticstrength. CT, liver scintigraphy and sonography in the case of localizedliver diseases agreed roughly in reference to sensitivity, specificityand accuracy. CT proved itself to be superior to the other non-invasiveprocedures in the number of correct type diagnoses. CT and sonographywere superior in diffuse liver diseases (n=173). The study showed thehigh diagnostic strength of CT with regard to the detection or exclusionof localized liver diseases and their type-diagnostic classificationand the high reliability of the method with regard to the differentialdiagnosis of icterus.
