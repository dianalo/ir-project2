The failure occured last Thursday night, six minutes aftera General Dynamics Atlas/Centaur rocket, carrying a satellitefor Japanese public broadcasting company NHK, roared off thelaunch pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla. One of two engines on theCentaur second stage failed to ignite, forcing controllers onthe ground to blow up the rocket. Engine maker Pratt andamp;Whitney declined to comment on the cause of the mishap.</LP><TEXT>   The satellite destroyed was a replacement for one lostlast year in an explosion of a French Ariane rocket. Thosesatellites, made by a General Electric unit, were to havebeen backups for Japan's current broadcasting satellite,which is suffering power problems and is expected to losesome broadcasting capabilities by June. Japanese broadcasterswill now likely be forced to temporarily eliminate one of thecountry's three existing broadcast-satellite stations thissummer, or remote areas of the country will lose access tosatellite television.   More significantly, the mishaps could delay plans by theJapanese government and industry officials to introduce a newsatellite channel by November that will deliver as many aseight hours a day of HDTV, the next-generation inbroadcasting that offers crisper pictures, better sound and ablending of different types of media. Those plans had givenJapan plenty of bragging rights, as HDTV has often been citedas evidence of that country's emerging technologicalsuperiority.   NHK, which runs two of Japan's existing satellite channelsand currently broadcasts one hour a day of &quot;experimental&quot;HDTV, plans to have another satellite launched in August.Originally, it intended to use that both as a backupsatellite and to start the new HDTV channel. But without anyother backups, and with questions about the reliability ofthe main satellite in orbit, launching the new channel couldbe too risky, one NHK official said.   &quot;It might be very difficult to have one channel for highvision. . . . We might have to review that,&quot; said theofficial, who asked not to be identified because &quot;this is avery delicate matter.&quot; An NHK spokesman declined to comment.   &quot;There's a good chance it will be delayed,&quot; said JeffreyZavattero, a Tokyo analyst with Jardine Fleming SecuritiesLtd.   Last week's accident is also likely to speed Japan's rushto develop its own satellite and rocket-launching industry,which lags behind the West's. Japan's efforts have riled U.S.officials, who say Japanese government support and protectionviolate free trade. But the recent glitches have raisedarguments in the Japanese press about the need to developindigenous space technology, and the latest accident willonly add force to that effort. Indeed, the August launchplanned by NHK will be aboard a Japanese rocket.   The U.S. is particularly sensitive to Japan's entry in thecommercial space business, in large part because of theground it lost to French launcher Arianespace over the pastdecade. Prior to the 1986 Challenger disaster, all commercialpayloads in the U.S. traveled via space shuttle. But with theshuttle grounded after Challenger and rocket makers likeGeneral Dynamics not yet in the commercial launch business,customers turned to Arianespace, which soon seized half the$1.2 billion annual world-wide commercial launch market.Arianespace currently has some 40 launches on its manifest,more than any U.S. commercial rocket maker.   Of the U.S. companies that make rockets big enough tocarry large communications satellites, General Dynamics hasthe most orders, with commitments for 25 commercial launches,but only one launch completed so far. Its chief U.S.competitor, rival St. Louis aerospace company McDonnellDouglas Corp., has completed nine commercial launches, buthas just four more coming.   Alan M. Lovelace, chairman of the General DynamicsCommercial Launch Services unit in San Diego, said thatalthough the launch failure was a &quot;great disappointment,&quot; ithas &quot;not discouraged us, and we remain committed to servingall of our customers by providing them with reliable launchservices.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
