(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three teen-agers have been charged withdefacing the American flag, raising constitutional questions inlight of the recent Supreme Court ruling on flag-burning, anAmerican Civil Liberties Union official said.   The charge stems from a vandalism spree Wednesday at Byrnes HighSchool in which two flags were burned, paint was sloshed on floors,books were scattered and fire extinguishers sprayed.   Three 13-year-old boys, students at another school, were chargedThursday in Family Court with defacing the flag, entering withoutbreaking, grand larceny and arson.   It has been illegal in South Carolina since 1916 to ``publiclymutilate, deface, defile, defy, jeer at, trample upon or castcontempt, either by word or act,'' the American flag. Similarstatutes protect the state and Confederate flags.   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an individual's right toburn the flag as a form of political expression under the U.S.Constitution.   Police Chief Chuck Shelton said Thursday he was aware of theSupreme Court decision but said he believed he had to follow SouthCarolina law as long as it remained on the books.   ``If they won't prosecute it, they don't have to,'' he said.   Steven Bates, executive director of the South Carolina ACLU, saidthe state flag-desecration law should now be consideredunconstitutional.   The suspects ``ought to be prosecuted under property crime law,''Bates said. ``They weren't desecrating the flag, they weredestroying other people's property.''   He said the ACLU is considering whether to argue that the chargein this case is inappropriate under the state desecration statute.   Solicitor Holman C. Gossett Jr. said he would have to examine thecase further before deciding whether to prosecute.</TEXT></DOC>
