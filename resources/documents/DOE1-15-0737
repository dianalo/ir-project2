Ambient radiationlevels result from naturally occurring radionuclides present in the soil,cosmic radiation constantly bombarding the earth from outer space, andthe contribution, if any, from the monitored facilities and other man-madesources. The Network is intended to measure radiation levels during routinefacility operations and to establish background radiation levels usedto assess the radiological impact of an unusual condition, such as anaccident. This report presents the radiation levels measured around allfacilities in the Network for the third quarter of 1987. A complete listingof the site facilities monitored is included. In some instances, twopower reactor facilities are monitored by the same set of dosimeters(e.g., Kewaunee and Point Beach).</TEXT></DOC>
