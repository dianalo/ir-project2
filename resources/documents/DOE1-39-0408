Nylon and A-150plastic walls swell as they absorb water from the air. This volume changecan increase the ionisation response by up to 2.6%. Graphite chambersdo not swell, but readily desorb and absorb water into and from the surroundingair, which makes it difficult to maintain dry air in a wet graphite chamber.Humid air has a different linear stopping power and W-bar/e-value thandry air. We observe approximately a 2% decrease in response-a value inagreement with estimates based on those effects. Polyethylene walls areunaffected by humid air.</TEXT></DOC>
