Wolf a lucrative multiyear contract that includes what amounts to a bonus that could net him more than $6 million, documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.    The bonus is in the form of a stock appreciation right, essentially a future cash payment promised by Allegis to make up for valuable stock options Mr. Wolf lost when he left Tiger International Inc. last December to join Allegis and its airline subsidiary, United Airlines.    Although not exercisable until Aug. 8, the right has a current indicated value of of $6.7 million, based on Tiger's closing price of $14.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The right consists of 590,000 units with a base value of $3.32 per unit. The agreement says Mr. Wolf is entitled to the difference between the unit's base value and the stock price at the time of exercise.    Although it was known that Mr. Wolf left behind valuable stock options at Tiger, that company has declined to comment on their exact value. The Allegis filing said Allegis &quot;recognizes that its compensation of (Mr. Wolf) must take into account at least a portion of the value&quot; of those options.    When the Allegis board tapped the highly regarded airline executive in December, the company wouldn't comment on compensation. The employment agreement, running more than 60 pages with attachments, was attached as an exhibit in the company's Form 10-K filing with the SEC.    The agreement indicates Mr. Wolf didn't do badly in negotiating other areas of his contract. It includes a base salary starting at $575,000 a year plus an &quot;appropriate&quot; annual bonus, an option to purchase 250,000 shares of Allegis stock and a supplemental retirement benefit that gives him credit for 22 years of service.    The base compensation compares with cash compensation of $578,981 that former Allegis Chairman Richard J. Ferris earned in 1986, his last full year with the company. At Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, Robert L. Crandall earned $1.8 million in 1986, but that included stock bonuses.    Mr. Wolf's agreement also contains a provision that would come in handy if the airline's pilots union or any other group succeeded in a hostile takeover. A change of control of the company resulting in a dismissal of Mr. Wolf would entitle him to three years of salary and bonuses.    While not unexpected, the agreement could give United Airlines difficulty in selling new labor contracts to members of its flight attendants and pilots unions. The flight attendants already have rejected one proposed contract that called for various concessions in return for a 4% wage increase over 42 months. Flight attendants union officials weren't available for comment.    &quot;I don't think any of us are surprised,&quot; said Frederick C. Dubinsky, chairman of the pilots union at United Airlines. &quot;We expected them to have to deal with the Tiger situation.&quot;    At the same time, Mr. Dubinsky said, &quot;We've always found it curious that management can always justify reducing costs everywhere but their own wallets.&quot;    Mr. Dubinsky said his union still is committed to an employee takeover of the airline, but wouldn't say when such a bid would be launched. &quot;He may have a shorter time than he expects,&quot; he said of Mr. Wolf, &quot;because we intend to put Mr. (William) Howard in that position.&quot;    Mr. Howard is the former chairman of Piedmont Aviation Inc.    An Allegis spokesman said the company had no comment on its agreement with Mr. Wolf. Now that its hotel and rental car units have been sold, the company essentially consists of United Airlines, and plans to change its name back to UAL Inc. at the annual meeting next month. </TEXT></DOC>
