Mathematicalmodel of electron capture into betatron acceleration in the presenceof additional pulse magnetic field was developed. It is shown that space-timevariation of magnetic field in the running clearance of accelerator duringelectron injection results to increase of efficiency of their captureinto acceleration of not less than three times; the obtained experimentalincrease was equal to 2-2.5 times. The calculation technique enablesto conduct systematically the simulation of electron capture into accelerationin order to obtain the best efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
