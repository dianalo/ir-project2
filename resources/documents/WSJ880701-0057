Politicians from both the South and industrial states push the Ohioan; most pollsters and Republicans agree he'd be the strongest running mate. Worries persist about his $2.3 million leftover campaign debt, but the biggest question may be whether Dukakis can relate to him personally. The two campaign together today.    Some Democrats still want Bentsen, saying he would counter Bush in Texas, but he doesn't seem eager to run. Some Dukakis strategists argue for a nominee who comes across as an uplifting choice -- and predict that the unknown but respected Rep. Hamilton would fit that bill. But as polls show the race tightening, Glenn's appeal increases.    &quot;Maybe only five members of the U.S. Senate are asked for their autographs,&quot; says pollster Peter Hart. &quot;He's No. 1.&quot;    THE DOLLAR'S RALLY reduces risks of a financial crisis before November.    GOP fears of a pre-election crisis triggered by foreign investors' pulling their money out of the U.S. have receded in the past two weeks, given the greenback's surprising strength. Even if the dollar does nosedive this fall, analysts say, it will be starting from a higher level.    Fed officials are particularly pleased with the dollar's new-found strength. They see it as a vote of confidence in their conduct of monetary policy; it reduces the threat of inflation and eases pressure for further interest-rate increases. Economist David Hale says the dollar's strength &quot;is dimming the prospect of an '89 recession,&quot; as well as an '88 financial crisis.    REAGAN WINDS DOWN as his staff readies a last political push.    As his thoughts turn to leaving office, he appears even less immersed in details than usual. He leans more on Shultz in meetings with foreigners, officials report, and was highly fatigued after the Moscow summit. Nancy Reagan is likely to assume even more influence in White House affairs as the president's own interest slips and chief of staff Howard Baker departs.    But a last-minute flurry of activity remains. The administration will soon approve a catastrophic-health-insurance bill it helped mold. Aides may be able to live with the Senate welfare-reform bill, but not the House version. The administration readies a Contra-aid package, though the timing and the question of lethal aid are unsettled.    One reason for the activism: most issues involve legislative maneuvering, new staff chief Duberstein's specialty.    BRIGHT FUTURE? Jackson supporters Eleanor Holmes Norton and William Gray win praise from the Dukakis camp after last weekend's harmonious platform meetings. Norton in particular held off some Jackson firebrands. Both would be strong candidates for jobs in a Dukakis administration, with Gray, the House Budget chairman, mentioned as a possible Treasury secretary.    REAGAN PLANS pitches to conservatives on behalf of Bush. He will meet with evangelists and woo conservative Southerners of both parties. But White House staffers say the vice president is better off if he doesn't campaign side-by-side with Reagan; Bush's stature diminishes if he's presented beside the president, they say.    MEASURED RESPONSE? Opponents of broad post-crash legislative action on the stock market quietly push a minimal bill giving the SEC emergency powers to halt trading and to monitor large trades. Advocates of broader action, such as Sen. Proxmire and Rep. Markey, debate whether to go along with the limited bill or hope for a more favorable climate next year.    COAL GOAL: The Pentagon may escape Congress's annual requirement that it buy 300,000 tons of anthracite coal it neither wants nor needs. Sen. Specter and other coal-industry allies will omit the requirement from this year's defense appropriation bill. &quot;Specter doesn't want the air of methane about him,&quot; a Pentagon wag says. -   SAFER SKIES? Regulators cross their fingers as the travel season arrives.    Some signs appear positive. Pilot reports of near mid-air collisions have fallen 26% so far this year, while controller errors are down 13%. Also, new congestion-predicting computer software at the Federal Aviation Administration is helping unsnarl skyjams before they occur. Still, aviation officials are far from sanguine.    The National Transportation Safety Board worries about controller mistakes at Chicago's O'Hare. Concern about commuter airlines mounts in the wake of an investigation; the FAA is likely to require commuter pilots to meet the training and proficiency standards of those at major airlines. Delays, which have declined this year, are expected to rise with increased traffic.    Some FAA officials believe fewer near-collisions are being reported only because the issue hasn't got as much publicity this year.    MINOR MEMOS: Isn't that what all the fuss is about? Defense contractor Raytheon, in a magazine ad, touts a communications system it makes as &quot;the Navy's way of keeping its business among friends.&quot; . . . The current Washingtonian magazine lists Illinois Rep. Price as the lawmaker most &quot;going to seed.&quot; Rep. Price died in April. . . . Reagan tells a Florida audience that Ponce de Leon failed to find the fountain of youth: &quot;I know. I was with him on that trip.&quot; . . . The Pentagon scandal proves an old fashion tip: never mix a Rep. with a Paisley. </TEXT></DOC>
