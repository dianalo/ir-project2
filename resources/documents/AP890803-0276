Patek Philippewatches. Tiffany lamps. Tudor chairs. Impressionist paintings.   Middle-class Argentines are selling family heirlooms accumulatedduring more affluent times in Argentina for the money they need toget through these days of hyperinflation and economic collapse.   Art dealers are flocking in from abroad to snap them up.   ``People are keener to sell for cash right now,'' said PierreYves Gabus, a Geneva-based art appraiser and auctioneer. ``Peoplewant dollars and they are selling what they have to get them.''   Gabus arrived three years ago. Since then, he has set up shop inthree other cities, and watched as competitors flocked to join himin Buenos Aires.   Fabian Ayerza, an assistant director of Sotheby's, said, ``Atthe beginning of this century, Argentines traveled often to Europeand they used to buy quite good things.''   Now, treasures carried across the Atlantic in the staterooms ofluxury ocean liners are returning home in jetliners.   ``There's no way to know the volume,'' said Alicia Arteaga, areporter who covers art for the newspaper La Nacion. ``A lot ofgalleries come in, buy $500,000 worth of French chairs, and leave.''   Every day, ads appear in newspapers promising cash for antiquefurniture, tapestries and rugs, necklaces, autographed manuscripts,signed crystal and, perhaps most of all, paintings.   A Patek Philippe watch can fetch $7,000. A sculpture by MarianoBenlliure y Gil, $330,000. A set of Dutch chairs from the 18thcentury, $2,500 each.   The painting ``Two Gypsies'' by Joaquin Sorolly y Bastida soldfor $140,000; the painting ``The Flight'' by Charles EdouardDelort, $100,000.   Buyers particularly want the Impressionist and ``Little Master''paintings of the mid and late 19th century that were bought bylandowners flush from the sale of beef and grain from theirsprawling estates.   The best private collections aren't for sale; the richestArgentines are weathering what is for them the latest downturn in adecades-long period of stagnation.   But many children and grandchildren of families whose fortuneshave declined are looking on living room walls and in closets,jewelry chests and basements for treasures.   Not a few wind up disappointed.   ``They bring in an incomplete set of dishes or some old chairsand a table they bought 40 years ago thinking they are antiques,''said dealer Franco Levi. ``They don't realize that to be anantique, something needs to be at least 80 to 100 years old.''   Fernando Sanchez Zinny, the director of Christie's in Argentina,said many Argentines bought indiscriminately and lugged home fakes.   ``It's disastrous for someone who has had a painting hanging onthe wall for many years, thinking it is worth a lot of money, thenwe go in there'' and tell them it is worth very little, SanchezZinny said.   The best pictures fetch prices from $50,000 to $1 million,dealers said. Some are sold outright. Most are sold on consignment.   ``A Flemish painting that was bought here for $40,000 sold forfive times that amount in the United States,'' said MauroHerlitzka, a collector.   Argentines don't seem worried by the outflow of such valuableobjects.   ``It's not like Argentina is losing its cultural heritage,''said Mrs. Arteaga. ``It's stuff that was brought here and now it'sgoing back to where it came from.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 6</NOTE></DOC>
