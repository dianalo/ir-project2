Some sections of balcony and iron railings were pulled down inthe accident, said Weber. But bricks that appeared to be missingafter the collapse actually had already been removed as part of arenovation project.   No one was hurt when the scaffolding collapsed Wednesday evening.No dollar estimate of the damage was available.   No cause for the collapse has been determined, Weber said. Stateofficials met with the contractor Thursday and determined thateveryone involved was properly insured, he added.   Authorities roped off the area around the building and a cranelifted debris from the square Thursday afternoon.   The three-story, state-owned building was completed in 1851 and,with a companion building on the opposite side of Jackson Square,was undergoing a $10 million renovation.   ``The project is to replace the brick, brick by brick, on thisend of the Pontalba buildings,'' said James Sefcik, director of thestate museum, with headquarters nearby.   Wednesday's accident was the second involving a Jackson Squarebuilding in 16 months. In May 1988, fire destroyed the top floor ofthe Cabildo, where the Louisiana Purchase territories weretransferred from France to the United States.   The Upper Pontalba and Lower Pontalba are among five historicbuildings on three sides of Jackson Square. All are designated asNational Historic Landmarks.   The others are the Cabildo, built in 1799; the St. LouisCathedral, rebuilt in 1851, and the Presbytere, started in 1791.</TEXT></DOC>
