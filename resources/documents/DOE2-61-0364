Depending on its design, the heatexchanger is able to utilise up to 90% of the waste heat potential available.The electric energy needed to operate such a system is more than compensatedfor by an approximately 50-fold gain of useful heat. To increase substantiallythe waste heat potential available and the amount of heat recovered,the system for recuperative heat exchange can be complemented by a heatpump. Such a heat recovery system on the basis of waste water is beingoperated in a public indoor swimming pool. Here the recuperative heatexchanger accounts for about 60%, the heat pump for about 40% of thetotal heat reclaimed. The system consumes only 1 kWh of electric energyto supply 8 kWh of useful heat.</TEXT></DOC>
