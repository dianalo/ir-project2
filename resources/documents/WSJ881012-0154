Thomas Labrecque, president of the nation's second-largest banking company, made the comments at the annual convention of the American Bankers Association here, as bankers increasingly conclude that Congress will adjourn soon without amending or repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which limits banks' underwriting powers.    &quot;We're ready to file,&quot; Mr. Labrecque said. &quot;We won't let grass grow under our feet, but we'd like to wait and see if we get legislation first.&quot;    The Chase executive stopped short of saying that the bank also would ask the Fed for authority to underwrite corporate equities, such as common stocks. However, Chase bankers have said the bank would seek this power eventually.    Mr. Labrecque said that the jurisdictional dispute between Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has made it unlikely that the House will act before adjourning. Earlier this year, over the objections of securities firms, the Senate passed a bill expanding banks' securities powers.    While bankers say that they would prefer congressional action, the Fed alternative remains open. Fed board member Manuel Johnson recently said that the Fed would look favorably on applications by banks to underwrite and deal in corporate debt and equities.    In a speech here yesterday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said that the repeal of Glass-Steagall remains &quot;certainly one of the board's highest priorities.&quot;    Without saying how the Fed would act on banks' applications for broader powers, Mr. Greenspan said, &quot;it clearly is preferable that clarifying and comprehensive legislation be enacted at the federal level.&quot;    Banks currently aren't allowed to underwrite securities other than government debt. However, banking laws allow affiliates of banks to underwrite certain other securities, provided the underwritings aren't the affiliates' principal business.    The Fed has allowed more than a dozen banks to establish affiliates for underwriting commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by consumer receivables.    Bankers assert that they need securities powers because many corporate clients have cut back on bank borrowing in favor of cheaper sources of debt, such as commercial paper and bonds. They also argue that some foreign bank competitors are allowed to underwrite securities in this country that U.S. banks can't.    Mr. Labrecque cited a recent incident involving the German subsidiary of a major U.S. client of Chase that was undertaking a substantial financing. Mr. Labrecque said that Chase lost the business to Deutsche Bank AG because the big German bank could sell corporate bonds in the U.S., while Chase couldn't.    &quot;We could distribute the bonds in Japan, in Europe, in the U.K., but not in the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Labrecque said. &quot;These powers are important to us. Our customers want them. The question is whether U.S. banks will be allowed to compete.&quot;    Besides seeking a broader range of securities to underwrite, banks also will be asking the Fed for permission to underwrite securities in greater volume.    The Fed's approvals of new securities powers so far have said that no more than 5% of the business done by banks' affiliates can consist of recently approved securities activities, such as municipal revenue bonds and mortgage-backed instruments. The bulk of the affiliates' business must involve U.S. government securities and general obligation bonds of state and local governments. The limitation has meant that only the biggest banks have been able to engage in new securities activities to any meaningful extent.    Banks are expected to ask the Fed to increase the limitation to at least 10%. </TEXT></DOC>
