Nature provides the snow and resorts say business is up abit from last year's poor level, when rain pelted the Eastand drought plagued the West. But discounts, late bookingsand wary skiers keep lodges, lifts and shops on edge. TheRockies wear plenty of new powder, but that's about allthat's new on slopes, says a spokesman for Aspen Skiing Co.&quot;People aren't buying new clothes and equipment,&quot; he says.Aspen has its tiniest lift ticket increase in 10 years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;People are shopping very tough this year,&quot; says NancyMarshall of Sugarloaf/USA in Maine, which cut all its lodgingpackages by 10% this season. Family packages help Sugarloaf,Vermont's Stowe Ski Resort, New York's Black Mountain SkiLodge and others fill booking gaps. &quot;People know they candrive up on a Friday night and get a room at a cheap rate&quot;without the bother of deposits, says Diane Drohan of the Innof the Six Mountains, Killington, Vt.   New York's Scribner Hollow Lodge bets that Atlantic Cityworkers will use its discounts to ski midweek.                                                                                                          ROLLERBLADE INC. rolls on those using Rollerblade or evenblade as a verb.   Success spells trademark headaches for the Minneapolismaker of gear for the sport it wishes you would call &quot;in-lineskating.&quot; Firm lawyers urge writers to resist turning thename into a verb. And it isn't shy over suing competitors forits namesake. Now, Rollerblade Inc. faces a new test: thedictionary. Random House Webster's College Dictionaryconsiders listing Rollerblade as a word, and the companybristles.   Trademark lawyer Vincent Palladino of Fish andamp; Neave, NewYork, notes that when a word goes generic -- as did elevator,zipper and cellophane -- rights can fade. It helps to have analternative word on hand. But &quot;in-line skating&quot;? RandomHouse's Jack Hornor says it will probably have &quot;Rollerblade&quot;in the next revision, noting it often lists trademarks (likeXerox) as such but with a mention of their common lower-caseuse, too. &quot;We're reporters of the language, we're nottrendsetters,&quot; says Mr. Hornor.                                                                                                          TRADING INVENTORY for tuition stirs interest, but dealsare few so far.   Elizabeth Fayhee, founder of Education Exchange Inc.,Chicago, links schools with barter exchanges to help arrangethe swap of goods for tuition. Rising tuitions and the wishof firms to make assets work harder spur queries, she says.The Archdiocese of Chicago, among others, mulls the idea. &quot;Ifyou have an empty desk in your classroom, you're not going tolose money,&quot; says the archdiocese's Brother Donald Houde. Buthe warns against accepting unneeded goods.   Traders like Chicago Barter Corp. and entrepreneur RobertRoss, founder of a pair of offshore medical and veterinaryschools, say tuition barter is still in its infancy. Mr. Rosshas yet to lock in a tuition swap. Chicago Barter says thatwhile new accounts nearly doubled last year, school swapswere rare. One success swap: John Fugate, sales manager atPar Craft Marking Products in Addison, Ill., will receive hisMBA from Lewis University this spring through barter of hisfirm's packaging supplies.   In an exchange, credits for goods are often &quot;banked&quot; inaccounts at a barter firm where traders can shop.

TO YOUR HEALTH, urge newsletters from major universitiesand hospitals.   Aimed at those over 50, health-related newsletters havemultiplied at least tenfold in the past decade and readershave quintupled, says the Newsletter Publishers Association,Arlington, Va. A decade ago, the &quot;Harvard Health Letter&quot; hadthe field much to itself. Is the market saturated? &quot;Thereseems to be an endless appetite,&quot; says Andrea Graham of theHarvard Medical School publications group, noting the$24-per-year letter has 300,000 subscribers.   Articles range from broad topics like exercise and agingto ways to help prevent specific maladies like high bloodpressure. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and others sayprofits from their newsletters are used for research andeducation. As the field grows, more specialization is likely,publishers say. The Johns Hopkins School of Medicinenewsletter focuses on health after 50 and a publication fromTufts University covers primarily diet and nutrition.   &quot;Mayo Health Letter&quot; also publishes a German-languageedition.
