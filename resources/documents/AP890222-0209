SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of President Bush's ethics commissionagreed Wednesday that senior officials of all three branches ofgovernment should be barred from accepting fees for speeches andarticles whether or not they get a pay raise.   ``The evil of honoraria is so great _ from the appearance of aconflict of interest,'' said former Attorney General Griffin Bell,in proposing a ban on the fees. ``People wonder who's paying allthese honoraria. It undermines confidence in government.''   All eight members agreed, though there was debate over whether tocouple this idea with a recommendation for a pay raise.   The tentative conclusions were reached at the third meeting ofthe eight-member panel appointed to recommend ways to stiffen andstandardize federal ethics laws and rules. Its final recommendationsare due on Bush's desk March 9.   Under enormous public pressure, Congress recently voted down 50percent pay raises for the top officials throughout the government,even though that recommendation from the Quadrennial Commission andPresidents Reagan and Bush was coupled with a proposal that membersof Congress stop taking honoraria.   The only former congressman on the ethics panel, onetime NewMexico Republican Sen. Harrison Schmitt, said, ``As a practicalmatter there is no way to divorce these issues from the salaryissue. A salary recommendation has been made, but as we can all seeit can't be implemented.''   But Judy Bello, general counsel of the U.S. Special TradeRepresentative, replied, ``I support the pay raise, but I supportthis ban without the pay raise.''   Former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler, who chaired theQuadrennial Commission, agreed. ``Honoraria cannot be justified bysaying that salaries are too low. Salaries should be dealt withdirectly.''   Chairman Malcolm R. Wilkey, a former federal appellate judge,summed up the consensus: ``The practice of honoraria has becomeevil. We'll let others deal with pay questions.''   If adopted, this would produce a larger impact on Congress thanthe executive branch. Executive branch rules already prohibit anyhonoraria for speeches or articles written on the area of one'sfederal job, so very few are offered.   Members of Congress may accept honoraria for speaking or writingon their congressional duties. The House allows members to receivehonoraria up to 30 percent of salary and the Senate up to 40 percentof salary. Both houses are paid $89,500 a year.   Among judges, Wilkey said, ``I've observed excessive teaching andwriting basically to earn income.''   The panel also agreed that top officials in all three branches ofgovernment should have their outside income limited to 15 percent oftheir salary. Again, this is the current eecutive branch standardand is lower than that used in Congress.   But Bush has said he wants his top officials to receive nooutside income. The panel endorsed letting presidents set higherstandards administratively ``to set an ethical tone,'' as Wilkey putit.   They also agreed that membership on the board of directors ofcommercial entities ought to be prohibited for top officials ingovernment.   Bell pointed out this would overturn a rule allowing judge'sremain on the board of family-owned companies.   Wilkey replied, ``I think it has to be changed. A man just has todecide whether he wants to be a judge or not. That rule fit theethos of 25 years ago but not now.''   They agreed that membership by top officials on nonprofit boardsshould be subject to approval by ethics officers.   On accepting lunches from businessmen and journalists, theyagreed the government should have a uniform standard, and theypreferred the executive branch standard, which basically bars them,to that of Congress where the Senate allows meals under $50 and theHouse meals under $35.   They also agreed that so-called double dipping laws limiting thepension that retired military officers can receive if they takecivilian federal jobs ought to be revised so that military pensionswere allowed to be taken in full if vested just like corporatepensions.   On financial disclosure, the panel agreed to recommend morereporting than now required for liabilities and for large assets andincome. They suggested an end to the exemptions for reportingmortgages on one's home and for debts to relatives.   They also agreed that asset disclosure should say whether thevalue was over $1 million as opposed to over $250,000 now and thatincome disclosure should say whether its was more than $250,000 asopposed to more than $100,000, which is the top disclosure categorynow.   At the same time, they recommended that the smaller categories ondisclosure forms be consolidated somewhat to reduce the risk oferror and the burden of getting appraisals of non-marketable assets.As Wilkey put this questions, ``What's the effective differencewhether an asset is worth $5,000 to $15,000 or worth $15,000 to$50,000? Why not just $5,000 to $50,000?''</TEXT></DOC>
