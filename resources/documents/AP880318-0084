Associate Deputy Insurance Commissioner Thomas P. Raimondi ruledThursday that Washington-based GEICO Corp. could not refuse autoinsurance in Maryland ``based solely upon the use or ownership of aradar detection device. (The guideline) constitutes an unfair tradepractice.''   GEICO, formerly Government Employees Insurance Co., which islicensed to provide auto insurance in 48 states, instituted theguideline last year. The ruling covers only Maryland and does notaffect GEICO's guideline nationwide.   GEICO Vice President August Alegi called the ruling ``bizarre''and ``shocking,'' adding the company will seek an injunctionagainst Raimondi's order and also will appeal in Baltimore CircuitCourt.   ``I can't believe that the state is telling people to go out andkill people and that we can't do anything about it,'' Alegi said.GEICO, which insures about 220,000 drivers in Maryland, hasreceived only three complaints in Maryland about the guideline, hesaid.   The Maryland ruling stemmed from a 1987 complaint by anOhio-based trade association representing makers and sellers of thedevices. The ruling was the first in the country on the issue, alobbyist for the trade association said.   The auto insurance industry in recent years has become moreconcerned about radar detectors, especially since the new 65-mphspeed limit became effective in some areas, said John Cook, vicepresident of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, anindustry-financed study organization.   GEICO was believed to be the first large insurer to institutesuch a guideline, industry groups said. Most companies still assessrisk based on driving records and convictions, said Harvey Seymour,vice president of the industry-funded Insurance InformationInstitute.   An estimated 80,000 motorists in Maryland and 4 millionnationally use radar detectors; the devices are illegal only inWashington, D.C., Connecticut and Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
