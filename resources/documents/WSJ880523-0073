A member says the agency's staff is puzzled at what he calls the &quot;mystery&quot; of the performance of these increasingly popular funds.    The SEC's study could lead to increased disclosure in closed-end fund prospectuses, agency officials said. Although it's too early to say what form that disclosure would take, one staffer suggested it might run along the lines of: &quot;Warning: This fund could damage your wealth in the first six months.&quot;    Closed-end bond funds have been especially popular in the months since last October's stock market crash. Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that trade on the open market at a premium or discount to their net asset value. This contrasts with open-end funds, which create new shares on demand.    The SEC study, expected to be completed within a month, is likely to suggest that shares of new closed-end funds perform much more poorly than other initial share offerings. The agency won't say how many funds it is tracking. But people with knowledge of the study say they believe it is examining 44 issues launched in the past two years.    Of the 44, these people say, 38 fell an average of 17.5% in value in their first four months, excluding the effects of overall market movements. Initial public offerings of stock by corporations, on the other hand, tend to level off after a first-day surge.    Closed-end funds have been the fastest-growing segment of the mutual fund business since the October crash. So far this year, 21 closed-end issues have been launched, raising about $9.5 billion, compared with $11 billion and 35 issues for all 1987, says Thomas J. Herzfeld, who runs a Miami-based investment management firm bearing his name.    Brokers have promoted closed-end funds, particularly bond funds, heavily in recent months amid investor disenchantment with stocks. They talk of projected yields of 10% or more, the absence of broker commission charges in the initial offering and the liquidity that comes from the funds being traded on major exchanges.    But many who have bought these funds at the initial offering have ended up feeling burned. One reason: Part of the initial price isn't invested at all but goes to the fund's underwriters for helping bring it to market. This portion typically is around 7%, meaning that only $930 of a $1,000 initial offering price actually is invested.    &quot;Underwriting spreads are like barnacles on the keel of a sailboat,&quot; Mr. Herzfeld said. &quot;They create an unnecessary drag on performance.&quot;    Moreover, the funds normally fall to a discount after briefly trading above their net asset value, as underwriters often act to prop up the price initially. That decline is what the SEC is scrutinizing.    People familiar with the study say one of the issues is the role of investment bankers and other institutions in placing and pricing the initial offering. Some funds slip quickly to a discount because of so-called flippers -- institutions that get a number of shares and sell them the first day they are offered.    In several closed-end offerings, these institutions have lined up a large number of sell orders that have driven down the share price. A $175 million bond issue by Boston-based Colonial Group Inc. that was set to begin trading in late March, for example, was quietly dropped because of the flipper problem. Officials of Colonial, a mutual fund adviser and transfer agent, said there were sell orders pending for more than five million shares as the fund was about to begin trading.    &quot;The big concern was that the fund could have gone to a substantial discount,&quot; John A. McNeice Jr., Colonial's chairman, said. This would have badly hurt retail investors in the initial offering.    Officials close to the fund estimated Colonial's loss at as much as $1.2 million. &quot;It was painful from an economic standpoint,&quot; Mr. McNeice said. &quot;But from a long-range business judgment, we decided to take everyone off the hook.&quot;    John W. Peavy III, chairman of the finance department at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, who has done research on closed-end fund issues, says he wonders why any investor would buy a new closed-end issue at a premium to net asset value. Such investing, he says, is &quot;seemingly irrational activity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
