The fluid-like nature of monomeric materialsprovides for a large clear aperture capability with excellent opticalquality, while the rigid nature of polymeric materials promotes environmentalstability in a free-standing film. Because of their natural birefringence,liquid crystals can be used in situations where anisotropic crystallinesolids are not available. Suitable applications include their use a spolarizers,retarders, notch filters, Solc or Lyot filters, Kerr effect shutters,nonlinear frequency converters, and nonlinear optical elements.</TEXT></DOC>
